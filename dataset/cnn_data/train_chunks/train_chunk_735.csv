An undertaker lost an incredible 14 stone after his daughter feared he was going to become his own customer. Colin Cuthell, 64, from Bo’ness, Scotland, tipped the scales at a whopping 31st, after years of binge eating and no exercise. Mr Cuthell, who runs family funeral firm Thomas Cuthell & Sons, had type 2 diabetes caused by obesity and had to be pushed around in a wheelchair on family holidays. Colin Cuthell, a 64-year-old funeral director, lost 14st after his daughter, Michelle, 31, warned him that he was in serious danger of becoming one of his own customers . Mr Cuthell (pictured with his wife, Marian) dropped from 31st to 17st by ditching his deep fat fryer and swapping unhealthy snacks for fruit and vegetables . But now he has transformed his life after his daughter, Michelle, 31, told him she didn’t want to lose him. Mr Cuthell, who is 6ft 3ins, now weighs 17st. He said: ‘Hearing my daughter say that really brought home to me how serious my weight issue had become. ‘I wanted to be around to walk her down the aisle and watch her have children but I knew my unhealthy ways would put me in an early grave. ‘In a few years I would have been dead if I’d continued with my unhealthy lifestyle. ‘My wife, Marian, had always nagged at me to lose weight but I never listened as I’d been big for so long I felt trapped.’ Mr Cuthell says that he feels he now has a new lease of life and that his life no longer hangs in the balance . Ms Cuthell, who works at the family run funeral directors, faces death on a daily basis, adding to her worry over her father’s health. She said: ‘I was petrified about my dad just dropping down dead, I hear about it happening to people all the time with the job I have. ‘I’m such a daddy’s girl, we have always been really close, I couldn’t imagine losing him, it would be unimaginable. ‘Over the past few years he had become bigger than I’d ever seen him and I watched helplessly as his health deteriorated. Mr Cuthell (pictured with his son Paul before his weight loss) had type 2 diabetes and was so overweight he sometimes had to use a wheelchair to get around . Ms Cuthell said: 'I'm such a daddy's girl, we have always been really close, I couldn't imagine losing him. Over the past few years he'd become bigger than I'd ever seen him - I watched helplessly as his health deteriorated' ‘I had to help him before it was too late, so I started researching weight loss options for him and I came across the Cambridge diet and researched it online.’ The pair met up with a consultant and Mr Cuthell’s staggering weight loss began. Ms Cuthell said: ‘I’m so proud of him, it’s unbelievable how much weight he’s managed to lose. ‘He’s like a new man, no longer insecure or out of breath, it’s amazing, I feel like a proud parent even though he’s my dad. Mr Cuthell worked unsociable hours which led to him eating at all hours of the day. Mr Cuthell lost weight by joining the Cambridge Weight Plan which saw him swap normal meals for low calorie soups, shakes and bars . He would drink hot chocolate with heaps of sugar and often deep fried food for his dinner. Thanks to the help of Cambridge Weight Plan he has managed to change his ways. The Cambridge Weight Plan sees dieters swap their ordinary food for a range of specially formulated soups, shakes, bars and rice puddings. People who follow the plan are also offered support from a consultant. Mr Cuthell said: 'I wanted to be around to walk my daughter down the aisle and watch her have children but I knew my unhealthy ways would put me in an early grave. In a few years I would have been dead' Mr Cuthell said: ‘I owe a lot to my daughter and my consultant, Deborah Paris. Thanks to them I have a new lease of life and my future is no longer hanging in the balance.’ Mr Cuthell has swapped his unhealthy snacks for fruit and vegetables. He has also ditched his deep fat fryer. Cambridge Weight Plan consultant, Deborah Paris, said: ‘Colin is such a lovely guy, his weight loss will hopefully inspire many other people to do the same. ‘He’s an amazing man and it makes my day knowing how much healthier and happier he is now.’","Colin Cuthell dropped from 31st to 17st after Michelle warned him he was heading for an early grave - he had type 2 diabetes and used a wheelchair .

MailOnline was given a demonstration of an advanced version of the system which also included a a ceiling projector and a wall of mirrors which turned into screens. One demonstration took us under water, with astonishingly sharp video from inside an aquarium surrounding us, while another showed a live view from a Paris street, turning the wall into a giant window. The effect is astonishing - although we suspect the cost of the system means most will only buy a front screen system. Images are incredibly sharp and clear, and trailers for action films like Elysium looked amazing, while the live feed from Paris is slightly disconcerting as it does almost feel like you’re there. We also tried out a smart coffee table with a projector above it - at the click of a button, it turned into a giant screen which could also track our hands making it rather like a massive iPad. ‘With 4k image quality, it opens up countless possibilities,' said Karai. ‘You can see the worlds best surf spots, or see a private sky box view of a concert.’ ‘We want to break free from screens and boxes, we even have a tabletop screen that can be controlled by your fingertips, turning your dining table into a giant touchscreen.’ The large box also contains speakers and storage space, and has been designed to look like a table when not in use. ‘Movies, video games, sports and photographs take on an air of realism, turning what was once a blank wall into a large as life 'entertainment window.', Sony said. 'The beauty of the new projector is that it requires no special tools or construction to install and operate.

Cycling straight past the bike lane, the death-defying 25-year-old - who has knocked out his front teeth and their replacements seven times - managed to traverse the 24-foot tall arches of the Seventh Street bridge in the Textas city of Fort Worth on Saturday. Shocked passers-by were stopped in their tracks by the sight of the professional rolling up and down the giant beams, while drivers continued along their journeys below, most of them oblivious to the action happening overhead.

The stunt was incident-free . 'It was all windy and crazy when I was up there. 'It was pretty exhilarating, that’s for sure.' The stunt was also illegal. A police car patrolling the area pulled up when they noticed the groups of people that had congregated to watch the crazy ride unfold. 'By the time they got out of their cars, I was already halfway across (the bridge)' Olson said. 'They were more astonished than anything: ‘'I can’t believe you’re alive right now. Are you kidding? Why are you doing this?''.' Olson had spoken with an attorney before the stunt to research any possible legal ramifications.

'They said: '‘To be honest, we’re glad you’re alive. We don’t want to see that on our watch. Tell your friends we’ll be watching out for this and we won’t be lenient the next time.'' ' Olson, who splits his time between Arizona and Fort Worth and dreams of competing in The X Games, has entertained crowds at Dallas Mavericks halftime shows and the State Fair of Texas.

A woman whose weight reached 22 stone by eating two dinners and two lunches every day has shed 12 stone - after being told her weight would kill her. Stacey Smith, 24, would secretly eat meals while out during the day and then return home for a second home-cooked helping prepared by her mother. During her school years her mother Marie would prepare her a packed lunch - unaware that Stacey was also receiving free school meals. Stacey Smith lost 12 stone after her desperate mother told her if she did not lose weight she would die . Stacey, pictured here with her old dress, has lost an incredible 12 stone and now is a size 10, weighing in at just 10st 8lb . And when Stacey got home she would prepare her own evening meal before Marie, 45, returned home from work to lay on a family dinner. After swelling to a size 28 her mother sat her down and told her that she was terrified her young daughter would die before her. This heartfelt message prompted Stacey to shed the weight - even losing three stone while she was pregnant - and is now a slender size 10, tiping the scales at a healthy 10st 8lbs. Stacey, of Norwich, said: 'Mum just sat me down one night when I was 19 years old and said to me 'I'm really worried about you and I don't want you to go before me.' Stacey's weight curtailed the things she was able to do, including going on fairground rides with her friends . By the time she reached 19-years-old, Stacey weighed a crippling 21 stone as a result of years of secret over-eating . 'She said 'I don't want to lose you' - she was worried I was going to die. 'If she hadn't said it I probably would have. She saved my life.' Stacey says she started piling on the pounds when she was just three years old. Her mother would lovingly prepare home cooked meals unaware that little Stacey was sneaking packets of crisps to eat in her bedroom. Her secret eating continued throughout school and her weight ballooned to 18 stone when she was just 14 years old. 'I just started getting bigger and bigger,' she said. 'When I was going to school my mum would give me lunch money but I would get dinners at school too because mum was a single working mum,' admitted Stacey. 'She didn't know. I wouldn't really have breakfast but I would go to the shop on the way to school and get crisps and baguettes using my lunch money for that but then I would have lunch at school too. 'I would come home and because mum was out working until the evening I would cook chips in the deep fat frier. Stacey's new found confidence saw her complete a training course in hairdressing and she can now run around with her daughter Millie-Marie without getting out of breath . 'I would cook anything in there - . onion rings and drumsticks - but wouldn't tell mum and I would go out . with my friends and she would make me a dinner too.'

The sun has unleashed a massive solar flare seven times the . size of Earth from one of the largest sunspots seen on the star’s surface. The stunning flare, the first major one of the year, peaked . at 6:32pm GMT yesterday and follows on the heels of a mid-level flare earlier . in the day. Each flare came from a different area of a large sunspot . group which Nasa believes is the biggest seen on the sun in nearly a decade. Scroll down for video... A false-colour composite image from a blast of activity originating from an active sunspot region at the centre of the sun's disk. The sun erupted with a powerful X1.2-class solar flare on Tuesday, disrupting radio traffic and sending a blast of electrically charged particles our way . Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Their energy . travels at the speed of light to reach Earth in just eight minutes. At Earth, a part of the atmosphere called the ionosphere absorbs it. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's . atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. However, when intense enough, flares can disturb the . atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This picture combines two images from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured yesterday. Together, the images show the location of a giant sunspot group on the sun, and the position of an X-class flare that erupted . Solar flares can temporarily alter the upper atmosphere creating disruptions with signal transmission from, for example, a GPS satellite to Earth. Another phenomenon produced by the sun could be even more disruptive. Known as a coronal mass ejection or CME these solar explosions propel bursts of particles into Earth's atmosphere. Those fluctuations could induce electric fluctuations at ground level that could blow out transformers in power grids. A CME's particles can also collide with crucial electronics onboard a satellite and disrupt its systems. This disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is on-going, . anywhere from minutes to hours. The latest flare already delayed the launch of a private cargo ship . to the International Space Station which was due to lift off today. Commercial spaceflight company Orbital Sciences was hoping . to launch a significant cargo delivery flight to the space station with . its Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft. The decision was made as the Antares rocket was awaiting launch at its pad at Nasa’s Wallops Flight Facility. ‘Early this morning the Antares launch team decided to scrub . today's launch attempt due to an unusually high level of space radiation that . exceeded by a considerable margin the constraints imposed on the mission to . ensure the rocket's electronic systems are not impacted by a harsh radiation . environment,’ Orbital Sciences said in a statement today. The latest flare is classified as an X1.2-class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more . information about its strength. It is not thought to pose a threat to the six astronauts and . cosmonauts living on board the International Space Station, Nasa has confirmed. Forecasters, however, are anticipating strong geomagnetic storm conditions to occur on January 9 and 10. This labeled image taken by SDO's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager shows the location of two active regions on the sun, labeled AR1944 and AR1943, which straddle a giant sunspot complex. A January 7, 2014, X1.2-class flare emanated from an area closer to AR1943 . The forecast is for a 'fairly direct' interaction with Earth, anticipated to arrive in around midday in the . UK. The storm may disrupt some GPS satellites in its path. ‘The solar flux activity that occurred late yesterday . afternoon resulted in an increasing level of radiation beyond what the Antares . engineering team monitored earlier in the day,’ Nasa officials added. The sun is currently in an active phase of its 11-year solar . weather cycle. The current cycle, known as Solar Cycle 24, began in 2008. In November, the sun fired off a similarly huge solar flare causing . a wide-area blackout of high frequency signal.

Winner: She led by 0.03 seconds after the opening run and ending up winning by 0.13 ahead of Maria Pietilae-Holmner of Sweden for the sixth victory of her career . 'It's been a fight all season and I . feel like, if I'm not perfectly ready, then the win goes to somebody . else. So I was really trying to prepare myself and be ready to go today . no matter what the conditions or the visibility.' Nastasia Noens of France moved up from 13th after the first run to finish third, 0.62 behind. Mikaela was only 0.01 ahead of Pietilae-Holmner at the final checkpoint but she excelled on the steep finishing gates to add to her lead. Conditions were difficult with snow falling on the top part of the course and rain at the bottom in the opening run, with spectators holding up umbrellas. During the second run, it was snowing at both the top and bottom. 'It's always a big confidence booster to have good skiing in different conditions,' the high schooler said. Triumph: 'I was really psyched to win again,' said Mikaela, who was 12th and second in her previous two slaloms . Powering through: Conditions were difficult with snow falling on part of the course and rain at the bottom in the opening run. 'It's always a big confidence booster to have good skiing in different conditions,' she said . High hopes: 'I never wanted to be a racer who could only win on hard snow or just soft snow, or just a steep pitch or just a flat,' said Mikaela (pictured December 28 in Lienz, Austra) 'I never wanted to be a racer who could only win on hard snow or just soft snow, or just a steep pitch or just a flat.

Marlies Schild won the past two races to set the record for most World Cup slalom victories with 35 and trailed Mikaela by just two points in the discipline standings entering the race. Determination: 'I was really trying to prepare myself and be ready to go today no matter what the conditions or the visibility,' she said .

Police investigating the disappearance of a young girl from her family's southern Arizona home said that child welfare workers went to the household in December, but authorities declined to provide additional details. The disclosure came nearly a week after the father of 6-year-old Isabel Mercedes Celis was barred from having any contact with his 10- and 14-year-old sons. Tucson police spokeswoman Sgt. Maria Hawke confirmed the visit but said she couldn't describe the circumstances that prompted it. The child welfare call was first reported by the Arizona Daily Star. Scroll Down for Video . Revelations: Police say that child-welfare officials went to the home of missing Isabel Mercedes Celis nearly five months before her disappearance . Tasya Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Economic Security, which oversees the state's child welfare agency, declined to confirm the visit or say why the girl's father, Sergio Celis, isn't allowed to be with his two boys. Authorities have been searching for Isabel since her father reported her missing April 21. Family members have said they last saw her in her bedroom the night before. A window was later found open with the screen pushed aside. A few days after the disappearance, a neighbor told KVOA-TV that she heard her dogs barking and male voices outside her bedroom window around 6:30 a.m. on the day Isabel was reported missing. The neighbor said there were no sounds that indicated a struggle. Police have declined to comment on those details. Missing since April 21, 6-year-old Isabel Mercedes Celis (left and right) was declared by police to have been abducted from her Tucson Arizona home . Earlier this week, police released 911 recordings of Sergio Celis reporting his daughter missing. He was calm while Isabel's mother, Rebecca Celis, was full of emotion. Calls to Sergio and Rebecca Celis weren't returned Thursday afternoon. And now after almost one month of the investigation into the disappearance of Isabel Mercedes Celis, including interviews with more than 500 sex offenders and examining 1,000-plus tips, police have acknowledged for the first time that the 6-year-old was taken from her home. But so far, authorities in Tucson, Arizona, haven't been able to name a suspect in the case. Revelations over the past week that Isabel's father, Sergio Celis, has been barred from seeing her two brothers raised questions about the focus and pace of their investigation. Yesterday, nearly a month since she went missing, police confirmed for the first time that she was abducted, rather than characterizing the case as a 'suspicious disappearance/possible abduction.' Authorities have been searching for the girl since her father reported her missing April 21. Family members have said they last saw her in her bedroom the night before. A window was later found open with the screen pushed aside. A few days after the disappearance, a neighbor told KVOA-TV that she heard her dogs barking and male voices outside her bedroom window around 6:30 a.m. on the day she was reported missing. The neighbor said there were no sounds that indicated a struggle. Police declined to comment on her account. Little girl lost: Authorities have been searching for the Isabel Celis since her father reported her missing on April 21. Family members have said they last saw her in her bedroom the night before . Pleas: Becky and Sergio Celis ask for the return of her daughter Isabel, six, at a volunteer center close to their Tucson, Arizona home last month . Authorities searched for Isabel in a three-square-mile area around her home, ponds, dry streambeds and empty houses. They also searched her house, but a judge has sealed those records until at least later this month. Police had examined the possibility that Isabel was in Mexico because of Tucson's close proximity to the border. Federal authorities have been in touch with Mexican police officials who checked hotels, bus terminals and other businesses as they looked for her. Meanwhile, Sergio Celis, an opera singer, sang 'Ave Maria' at a May 6 benefit to raise money for the search for his daughter. Finding Isa: Daniel Cadena, foreground, holds a candle along with his mother, Angela Sanchez, left and his aunt, Areliz Sanchez during a recent vigil . Missing: Police believe Isabel Celis, 6, was taken from her Tucson home the night of April 20 . Police announced in a news release late last week that Arizona's child welfare agency was barring him from having any contact with his 10- and 14-year-old sons. On Monday, after a regularly scheduled news conference, investigators released 911 recordings of him reporting his daughter missing. He was calm while her mother's reaction was full of emotion. Sergio Celis told a 911 operator that he believed his daughter was abducted. Asked to explain why he thought that, Celis said, he couldn't and that Isabel wasn't there when the family awoke. 'I want to report a missing person,' he said, calmly. 'My little girl, who is 6 years old. I believe she was abducted from the house.' Evidence: The video shows two males and three females walking in a parking lot in the direction of the Celis home on the night she went missing between 1 and 1:30am . The tone of Celis' wife, Rebecca, was frantic. 'She's only 6,' said the mother as she cried. 'Can you please hurry and get somebody over here?' Calls to Sergio and Rebecca Celis weren't returned Tuesday. Michael Piccarreta, a criminal defense lawyer in Tucson who isn't involved in the case but has followed it, said family members are normally eliminated as possible subjects at this point in investigations. In some cases, he said, police focus on family members longer than usual. 'That doesn't mean they are guilty,' Piccarreta said. 'It could mean the police are having difficulty with an alternative theory.' Police spokeswoman Maria Hawke said investigators have eliminated one theory. Innocent: Tucson police have scoured the girl's home and interviewed more than 500 sex offenders in the area since Isabel disappeared . 'She didn't get up and leave the house on her own,' Hawke said. She declined to discuss the evidence that led investigators to make that conclusion or reveal details about who they suspect took her. Experts say the abduction of a child from a home is relatively rare. Police are holding out hope that Isabel is still alive. Tasya Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Economic Security, which oversees the state's child welfare agency, declined to comment on why Sergio Celis isn't allowed to be with his two boys. She also declined to say whether there were any past calls at their home. Vanished: Isabel has now been missing for nearly a month and the search has expanded as far as Mexico . The Arizona Daily Star had reported early Tuesday that police concluded that Isabel was abducted. Lynn Jones, a criminology professor at Northern Arizona University, said the public will connect the decision to prohibit Celis from seeing his sons with the 911 recordings because they were both released around the same time. 'So law enforcement, I would imagine, would have to do some work if they don't want them to be perceived together,' Jones said. Hawke said it was a coincidence that the two pieces of information were released at once and that the child welfare decision was released to keep the public informed of the investigation. News organizations had been requesting the 911 recordings, which take a while to prepare and happened to be ready on the same day as the child welfare news conference. 'People are free to form their own opinions,' Hawke said. David Pike, who lives on the same block as the Celis family and whose sons used to play with Isabel's brothers, said he is perplexed by how calm the father sounded in the 911 phone calls. 'It just struck me as odd. I get excited easily if I think one of my kids are hurt ... and then there's times I've just sat there dumbfounded. 'Maybe that was a dumbfounding moment for him and he wasn't able to wrap his mind around it right away,' he said. 'Maybe he truly thought she was playing a game,' Pike said.

When Tracy, a single mother-of-five, heard banging in her attic, she thought the worst it could be was an animal or a ghost. But when she sent her older sons and nephew up to check, they found a man she had broken up with 12 years ago sleeping in her heating unit at her home in Rock Hill, Charlotte. The 44-year-old had just been released from prison two weeks ago. Scroll down for video . Scene: A Rock Hill woman says she found an old boyfriend living in the attic of her home, pictured, after he was released from jail recently . She said of the discovery: 'My nephew found a man. He had packed all the old coats and jackets into the heating unit and was sleeping in the heating unit' Tracy, who did not want to be named because her ex-boyfriend is still on the loose, said she last saw him a year ago when he did some odd jobs for her at her home and, though she had letters from him while he was in jail, she made it clear things were over. She told the Charlotte Observer that his addiction to drugs and offenses for robbery - including her own truck - meant she was not interested and broke up with him for good 12 years ago. 'That was it. I never looked back.' Talking about the night she discovered the man in her house, the nurse said she had a feeling 'something wasn't right'. Then, she said she heard a thump coming from the ceiling and noticed things coming loose from the ceiling. Peep hole: An arrow, bottom left, points to the air vent the 44-year-old was using to spy on his ex-girlfriend with from the attic .

She said: 'Then all the nails just popped out of the ceiling over my bed. Like ""bing, bing, bing"". I thought there was some poltergeist stuff going on.' That's when she sent the men in her home to check out the attic. 'They found a man. He had packed all the . old coats and jackets into the heating unit and was sleeping in the . heating unit,' she said, adding that the man ran downstairs and out of . the house before police could get there. Tracy later discovered that her husband had been sneaking into her house, though police are still unsure how he managed to do so. Officers said they found a number of Sonic cups filed with feces and urine in the attic. The only entrance to the attic is inside the home -- in the hall that connects her children's bedrooms.

Tragic: Jimmy Mizen, 16, was murdered by Jake Fahri, 19, in May 2008 whilst at the Three Cook's Bakery in Lee, South East London . After listening to families whose children have been murdered through street violence, I found it impossible to ignore their pleas for help in finding solutions to a problem which has blighted too many lives. I often reflect on the bravery and courage shown by Barry and Margaret Mizen, whose teenage son Jimmy was murdered in 2008. The Mizens are convinced – as I have been for the past 40 years – that part of the solution  is in providing more structured activities for young people. In my opinion, tragedies such as the murder of Barry and Margaret’s son are the extreme result of too many young people no longer guided through a rite of passage; young people who would benefit from the guidance and help of organisations such as the Guides, Scouts, cadets and other youth organisations. However, these are all groups which are hampered in their growth by a lack of adult volunteers. Speaking with Barry and Margaret and members of Families United – a group for those parents whose children have been torn away from them and killed in such appallingly brutal ways as a result of gang violence – made me even more determined to start a long-term leadership campaign. This would provide many more opportunities for all young people to acquire a sense of constructive purpose, motivation and service, and also build on a collaborative initiative with youth organisations, called Youth United, that  I started four years ago. This kind of initiative can help to provide a constructive team-based substitute for destructive gang violence, so that no more families like the Mizens should have to suffer such untold  misery in the future. This week at Buckingham Palace, I am joining the leaders of Britain, including the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, plus 50 young people, to launch a pledge campaign called  #iwill through a collaborative youth initiative called Step Up 2 Serve. I believe that such a long-term campaign, which is supported by all sectors of society and involving faith and political leaders, education, business, trade unions and the voluntary sector, has a unifying vision. That vision is that all of us, from all walks of life, will ‘step up’ and pledge, at #iwill, to help young people take every opportunity to be of service to others. At present, just 29 per cent volunteer regularly, although more may do so informally. The campaign proposes that we should support and inspire 50 per cent of all those aged between ten and 20 to take part in practical action in the service of others by 2020. I am so glad that the main political parties and youth organisations and businesses are saying  ‘I will’. I know that young people have an immense contribution to  make to our society, but I have long believed we are failing to do enough to unlock their talent and unleash their energies to help tackle all sorts of challenges. Young people are the solution to so much and yet, too frequently, they are seen as the problem. A family torn apart:  Prince Charles, meets with Barry and Margaret Mizen during a visit to the Cafe of Good Hope following the death of their son . In the nearly 40 years that I have . been supporting youngsters, many of them have told  me they also want . the chance to put something back and assist their communities. If . you think that all over our country there are thousands of lonely old . people who need company, younger children who need alternatives to . hanging about on street corners, crucial environmental work that needs . doing, and local causes that need espousing, it is not difficult to see . how any small voluntary contribution can help. As . I travel the length and breadth of our land, I am  fortunate enough to . see marvellous examples of youth-led social action. I am incredibly . proud of all the young people I meet who are already engaged in such . action because through this experience they can then go on to motivate . others. In Ayrshire last month, I presented members of the first Police Cadet Unit in Scotland with their certificates, and was enormously encouraged to hear of the large numbers who wanted to join through their schools. These examples – and countless others – give me hope that we  can achieve our goal of Step Up  2 Serve. While much is done by young people through their own efforts or through great youth organisations and inspirational teachers, we need them to start volunteering at a younger age, and embed the habit of community involvement in those vital years when they move from primary school to secondary school. To do this effectively, we must enlist thousands more adults to  support and motivate younger people in their social action, and to encourage those who have already been involved to engage and lead others. Young people need to be recognised and celebrated for their progress – as the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award does so successfully – and we must develop many more opportunities which stretch and challenge those in their service to others. I remember a speech I made in the House of Lords in the early 1970s. I spoke about the need for young people to be of service to others, to face challenging situations, and to learn and reflect on that experience. I myself was a volunteer coastguard – as well as spending time in the cadet unit when I was at school – and I remember what a difference that made to me at that age. Some 25 years ago, I set up the Prince’s Trust Team programme as a pilot community service scheme, and that confirmed to me that volunteering to help others brings immense benefits to young people, as well as to  the whole community. Support: Prince Charles is joining David Cameron and Nick Clegg, pictured, in supporting the #iwill campaign, part of the Step Up 2 Serve initiative . The young people learnt social skills, built up their confidence and self-esteem and realised – perhaps for the first time – the contribution they could make  to those who needed assistance, and the satisfaction they could feel from service to others. In total, 160,000 young people have completed this one programme run by my Trust, and thousands more each year clear derelict sites, create community gardens, help disabled children or produce films which warn  of the dangers of gun and knife crime. Helping hand: The Duchess of Cambridge has helped increase the ranks of much-needed Scout volunteers during her time as an occasional volunteer for the organisation . My Trust will double the number of young people volunteering as our pledge to the Step Up 2 Serve campaign. The motivation, commitment and sense of purpose the volunteers develop is truly inspiring and makes me enormously proud of what young people can achieve. I am equally encouraged to hear that the National Citizens Service, established now as a ‘rite of passage’ programme for 16-year-olds, is  having the same effect for many young people, and so we now need to develop the journey  earlier on in their lives. The CBI recently reported that employers need young  people who are optimistic, determined and emotionally intelligent – and research shows that youngsters who take on challenging volunteer activities have all those character traits and virtues. I believe the business world has a vital role to play too, not only by making it clear that it values this in future recruits, but also by actively supporting  employees as adult volunteers. And so I hope that many companies will pledge at #iwill to support Step Up 2 Serve. I need hardly say that I am particularly delighted that my daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, has helped to swell the ranks of much-needed Scout volunteers during her time as an occasional volunteer for the organisation, since enrolling many more adults as leaders is the greatest need for so many of our youth groups. And in this sense I would hope that we might also build on  the wonderful volunteering spirit and the contribution made by so many to the success of last year’s London Olympics. I wanted to convene and launch this campaign as I reached my 65th birthday in order to  support all those who are engaging young people to say ‘I will’, and to underline the vital  contribution youngsters can make with their service to the community. On Thursday, the campaign will announce and encourage pledges from organisations and individuals all over Britain. I can only hope that Mail on Sunday readers will be moved to consider what their personal contribution to the Step Up  2 Serve campaign could be and perhaps pledge their support  at #iwill. stepuptoserve.org.uk .","Death of Jimmy Mizen, 16, inspired the Prince to encourage volunteering .

A Spanish photographer has created a collection of pictures featuring animals dressed in human clothing. Miguel Vallinas who is based in Madrid, has called the project Segundas Pieles which means Second Skins. But rather than just creating a collection of funny pictures, Vallinas tries to imagine which clothes the animals would choose for themselves if they could. The collection called Segundas Pieles, or Second Skins, not only attributes clothes to the animals but imagines what kinds of personalities they would have . A stag is depicted looking relaxed in an open shirt and jacket in the collection where Vallinas has imagined which clothes the animals would choose for themselves if given the choice . A doe is depicted in the personality Vallinas has imagined for her, wearing a mini skirt and knee high leather boots . A swan is shown in ballerina pumps and a floaty skirt in a possible nod to its ballet roots with Swan Lake . Among the featured animals is a blazer bearing stag, a mini-skirted doe and a vulture wearing a parka jacket. The . animals appear to assume stereotypical characters, with the wise owl . keeping warm in a jumper and the glamorous, exotic zebra sporting a fur . trimmed, leather sleeved coat. The artist looks at a strange variety of animals including a few species of bird such as bustards, flamingos and vultures. The project is a possible continuation of the photographer's previous collection, Pieles (skins). A notably glamorous zebra sports a fur-lined coat in the bizarre collection of photos .

Flamingo pink: The creature known for its flamboyant colour and elegance is shown in a chic and feminine outfit . A roe deer in a sherling jacket is shown with his hands in his pockets . The two series could be linked with the first featuring several portraits of people which aim to investigate the internal aspects of human life by examining a collection of men dressed in different work uniforms. The project was designed to expose the human condition but has instead been criticised for featuring men only. The men pose in the characters of firemen, construction workers, bin men, doctors and barbers.

The chief executive of a taxpayer-funded scheme that leases cars and  scooters to the disabled earned about £850,000 in pay and perks last year. Mike Betts, 51, received the money as boss of Motability Operations, a not-for-profit company funded by the state. Four other senior directors at the firm also earned large sums, taking home more than £2million in total in 2012. Motability Operations, which received . £18.3million in government grants last year to cover its running costs, . leases various types of vehicle to around 600,000 disabled people. It receives their mobility allowances direct from the Department for Work and Pensions. Last night politicians and campaigners condemned the ‘lavish’ and ‘over generous’ management pay scales, and called for cuts. Labour . peer Lord Rooker said: ‘This scheme has been run for 30 years and . provides an excellent service but I can’t believe it requires people on . banker-style salaries to administer it.’ Jonathan . Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is vital . that mobility allowances are used to help those who really need it. This is a staggering sum of money for someone to earn from a business whose only customer is taxpayers. ‘Given . Motability Operations is wholly reliant on government grants it’s . absolutely right that it should face scrutiny over how it is run.’ Disability campaigner Josh Lennon said: ‘There is absolutely no need for the Motability bosses to be paid such lavish salaries. It is time these over-generous wages were reined in. 'They do a good job ensuring many people have the independence and mobility they wouldn’t otherwise have, but we would like to see cuts in their remuneration.’ Motability Operations is owned by Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, and overseen by registered charity Motability. In its annual report, the company boasts that it is guaranteed an income stream with ‘minimal credit risk’. Mr Betts, who has been chief executive since 2003, is the highest-paid director, on a basic salary of £487,525. Lifeline: Motability Operations, which received £18.3million in government grants last year to cover its running costs, leases various types of vehicle to around 600,000 disabled people . He also received £237,500 in performance-related pay, £24,295 in benefits and £96,881 in lieu of pension. The scheme faced criticism in 2011 over claims that expensive saloon cars leased to the disabled were being driven by their family and friends. Government officials voiced concerns that it was encouraging spurious benefits claims, and that checks on relatives allowed to drive the cars were too lax. In 2006, Welsh welterweight boxing champion Keith Jones used his free Motability car to drive to the gym and fight 100 bouts. The boxer was fined £500 in June that year after claiming he did not know he had to tell the DWP that his asthma condition had improved. A Motability Operations spokesman said Mr Betts had been ‘instrumental in driving forward changes to the organisation to deliver the levels of personal care, expertise and service required’. He added: ‘The remuneration is decided by the board based on the advice of their Remuneration Committee.’ The spokesman said pay is reviewed  regularly to ensure it is competitive over the long term, and to make sure rewards are related to performance. Welfare Minister Lord Freud said in a statement: ‘The department regularly monitors and evaluates the use of public funds by the organisations we work with, including charities such as Motability, to make sure the services they deliver are fit  for purpose.’","Mike Betts received the money as boss of Motability Operations .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . PUBLISHED: . 18:03 EST, 14 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:18 EST, 14 January 2014 . The BBC is planning to use £740 million from the licence fee to fill a giant £2 billion hole in its pensions scheme. A new valuation has revealed that the deficit in the Corporation’s pension fund has almost doubled from £1.1 billion in 2010. But instead of asking staff to help plug the gap – a request which previously led to strikes and prime-time programmes taken off air – the BBC will take a large slice from the taxpayer-funded licence-fee to foot the bill over four years. Black hole: The BBC is planning to use £740 million from the licence fee to fill a £2 billion gap in its pensions scheme . At about £185million a year, each top-up is nearly twice the annual budget of Radio 4. The figures, published in a report by the BBC’s independent pension trustees, mean around £7.36 of every household’s £145.50 licence fee now goes towards the pension deficit. But rather than release the embarrassing figures publicly, the BBC published them only in an internal email to its staff, prompting accusations it wanted to hide the bad news. MP Rob Wilson said the BBC should have been 'accountable' and made the announcement publicly . Last night Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It says it all about how the BBC operates that this huge black hole in its pension fund was announced internally, rather than the Corporation being open and accountable to the public who will have to foot the bill.’ Similar to public sector workers, many BBC staff had a generous final-salary scheme that guaranteed a pension based on the length of service and earnings at the end of their careers, but it was closed to new staff in 2010 amid concerns over the mounting deficit. The BBC has already faced criticism that it is overstaffed and bloated with managers. A FOI request in 2011 found that out of 4,500 staff on permanent and fixed-term contracts, 2,000 had the word ‘manager’ included in their job title. It also has 8,000 journalists – vastly more than the rest of Fleet Street put together. Between now and 2017, the BBC will have to pump an extra £365 million into its pension fund on top of £375 million it had already agreed to pay. However, the BBC yesterday said it had anticipated the increase in its pension deficit two years ago, and took the increased payments into account when making its current financial plans. This meant that programme budgets are unaffected by the additional payments from the licence fee. The BBC’s generous pension arrangements have been a source of contention for years. Some of those who have benefited from huge BBC pensions include former deputy director general Mark Byford, who walked away with a £3.4 million pension pot – on top of a £1 million severance payment – when he was made redundant in 2011, and radio chief Dame Jenny Abramsky, who retired in 2008 with a pension pot worth £3.9 million. Lucrative: Those emerging from the BBC with multi-million pound pension pots included former deputy director general Mark Byford (£3.4 million) and former radio chief Dame Jenny Abramsky (£3.9 million) The last pension valuation, in 2010, led to protracted industrial action after the BBC asked staff to accept lower benefits and higher contributions. When negotiations with unions collapsed, journalists and technical staff left their posts, forcing flagship programmes including Today and Newsnight off the air. Last night, BBC insiders said the deficit had been caused by low interest rates and an increase in the life expectancy of pension holders. A BBC spokesman added: ‘We have agreed a sensible and affordable plan to address the deficit, without adversely affecting programmes or pension scheme members.’","Corporation plans to use £740 million from licence fee to plug the gap .

The father of a regular Law and Order: Special Victim's Unit star has been charged in a sex abuse scandal that sounds like a plotline from the show. Bill Roache, an actor from British soap opera Coronation Street, is charged with forcing young girls to perform sex acts on him in the bathroom of a television studio headquarters. The 81-year-old actor is the father of Linus Roache, whose American acting credits include frequent appearances on Law and Order: SVU and the role of Thomas Wayne in Batman Begins. End of day one: Linus Roache (left) and his sister Verity (right) are at their father Bill's side (center) as they leave a Northern England court on Tuesday after the first day of the trial where he is accused of raping a child and five other sex offences . The elder Roache now faces two counts of rape involving a 15-year-old girl in 1967 as well as five indecent assaults involving four girls aged between 11 and 16, between 1965 and 1968. Prosecutors claim he targeted 'star struck teenagers', including autograph hunters, before attacking them at the Manchester studios where Coronation Street was filmed, in his Rolls Royce and at a house in Lancashire. When charged with rape, Roache - who . plays Ken Barlow in the ITV1 show - issued a statement in which he said . he was 'astounded and deeply horrified' by the accusations. He . said: 'I strenuously deny the allegations and will now focus my full . attention on fighting to preserve my innocence in the challenging times . ahead. Like a plotline: The graphic sex acts described in his father's trial sound like something that could have been a storyline for an episode of Law and Order: Special Victim's Unit, where Linus (left) was a regular guest star . Changing: Linus Roache began appearing on Law and Order in 2008, and looked different today (at right) as he walked out of the court with his father . 'I would like to . offer my sincere thanks to all those people who have offered me their . support and good wishes at this difficult time.' Roache later formally pleaded not guilty to the seven counts he faces. Two other famed entertainment figures are also on trial today for sexually assaulting young girls, but both Rolf Harris and Dave Lee Travis have entered not guilty pleas. Harris, a veteran television presenter, is accused of carrying out the historic sex attacks over an 18-year period between 1968 and 1986. He also faces a further four charges of making indecent photos of a child but is yet to enter pleas. Travis, a radio DJ, is on trial for allegedly attacking nearly a dozen young women over the course of three decades - including while acting in a pantomime and at the opening of a hospital radio station. The 68-year-old, whose real name is David Patrick Griffin, faces 13 counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault, dating between 1976 and 2008. The . prosecutor said while the case concerned events which happened a long . time ago, that did not mean the allegations were less important. 'If . you think a victim of crime has lost the opportunity to complain . because he or she did not complain at or near the time, please think . again,' attorney Anne Whyte said in opening statements on Tuesday. 'A crime is a crime, whenever it takes place'. Setting out the allegations made by five women, the prosecutor said the first complainant in the case contacted the police last March. Her son had been discussing infamous sex scandals involving Cyril Smith, a now-deceased politician, and  the late BBC presenter Jimmy Saville, and how long it had taken for victims of sexual offences to come forward. She then told him he had been attacked by Roache and agreed to go to the police. The victim, aged 15 at the time of the alleged offences in 1967, told police that she was at a house in Lancashire and claimed 'without any preliminaries' was led to a double bedroom and raped. The prosecutor said: 'He did not attempt to kiss her or sweet-talk her in any way. 'She describes it being uncomfortable and to feeling panic-stricken. She had never had sex before.' Afterwards it was as if nothing had happened, the court heard. Same line of work: Linus followed in his father's career footsteps as his dad was has been a longtime star of British soap opera Coronation Street . On screen: The actor's on screen wife, Deidre, played by Anne Kirkbride, will give evidence during the four week trial, the court heard . The second time, at the same house, Roache is alleged to have pushed her against a wall and raped her once more. 'When it was over, she ran out,' Miss Whyte said. The jury was then told about another alleged victim of Roache's, now aged 63, who was just 14 in 1965 when the actor is said to have indecently assaulted her. That summer she visited Granada Studios in central Manchester with a friend to take part in a talent show and afterwards she saw Roache in the building and recognised him, Miss Whyte said. 'She was naturally impressed. She and her friend ended up in a dressing room with the defendant and other actors,' the prosecutor said. He then led her by the arm to the men's toilet, where he allegedly made her commit a sex act on him. 'There was no conversation and they went back to the dressing room where her friend was still chatting to an actor'. Afterwards, Roache sent her a letter and signed photograph of himself, which will be shown to the jury. In the dock: Coronation Street star Bill Roache is accused of two counts of rape and five indecent assaults dating back almost 50 years . Attacks: The prosecution say the star enjoyed attacking girls ins in a risky place, 'using his position and fame to try and obtain a continuation of sexual gratification' But this was not a 'benign personal touch' by a 'well-known young male actor', the court heard. Instead it was a deliberate act, Miss Whyte said, 'designed to impress a young schoolgirl and to secure her unquestioning loyalty as a fan for a sexual purpose. A sort of grooming, as we would nowadays call it'. As his four-week trial started today, jurors were told to remember the actor is accused of sex offences - not his much-loved character Ken Barlow. Mr Justice Holroyde QC said it was important to distinguish between the 'real person' and the part he has played on the ITV soap since its first episode in 1960. Mr Justice Holroyde said: 'You may feel in one sense you know the defendant, Mr Roache. He is well known as an actor who for many years has played the part of Ken Barlow in Coronation Street. 'But of course this is not the fictional character of Ken Barlow in court. It is a real person, William Roache, who is on trial. 'You must separate the fictional character from the real person, you will have to decide verdicts from the evidence you will hear from a real person, about a real person'. The world's longest-serving soap actor has not appeared in the programme while the legal proceedings are ongoing. He . has been on bail since his arrest with various conditions including . residence, no direct unsupervised contact with anyone under 16 and not . to approach named witnesses.

Keeping history alive: Alexandria, Virginia currently has a law that mandates that a certain number of new streets be named after Confederate generals given the town's involvement in the Civil War . A city just 15 minutes’ drive away from Washington D.C. is now considering a repeal of an old law that requires a certain number of new streets to be named for long-dead Confederate generals. Alexandria in Northern Virginia, just across the Potomac River from the nation’s capital, is steeped in history but some local politicians are hoping to prevent some new reminders of the Civil War. City Councilman Justin Wilson introduced legislation for Tuesday night's council meeting to do away with a 1963 law requiring that any new 'streets running in a generally north-south direction shall, insofar as possible, bear the names of confederate military leaders.' Wilson's bill also would eliminate a . requirement that new east-west streets be named for persons or places . prominent in American history. Wilson . said he wants to remove a series of anachronistic laws, and his . proposal also would repeal a ban on 'lewd cohabitation' and laws . regulating a bygone fad of 'rebound tumbling,' a form of trampolining. As a practical matter, there is little likelihood that the city will be naming new streets any time soon. The . city, inside Washington's Capital Beltway and separated from the . nation's capital by the Potomac River, is essentially built out. In . fact, the street grid of the city's Old Town section dates to Colonial . times. Wilson said that . symbolically, he believes it's a good thing to strip from the code a . provision that in some ways glorifies the Confederacy. Staying the same: While Old Town Alexandria (pictured) is steeped in history, the greater area of Alexandria is continuing to expand as many people live in the area and commute to Washington, D.C. as it is just minutes away . Very close: Alexandria was largely occupied by Union troops during the Civil War, which comes as little surprise given it's proximity to the national capital . That said, he made clear he is not proposing that the city change existing street names, some of which honor Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney, whose Dred Scott decision denied citizenship and constitutional protections to blacks before the Civil War. 'I think we struggle in the city with our history,' Wilson said. Alexandria was occupied by Union troops for most of the Civil War and, like the rest of Virginia, has a history of slavery and segregation. It is now a liberal bastion in Virginia - Barack Obama won 71 per cent of the vote in 2012. On historic Duke Street in Old Town, the building that was once home to the nation's largest domestic slave trading company is now home to the Northern Virginia Urban League, which operates the Freedom House Museum there to tell the story of the slave trade. Trading on it's name: Historical re-enactments are big tourist draws in the area, explaining why some are fighting against the measure . Cynthia Dinkins, president and CEO of the Northern Virginia Urban League, said she personally supports any legislation that keeps the city from unduly honoring the Confederacy. Still, while she is wary of glorifying the Confederacy, she said care must be taken remember unpleasant parts of American history. 'Some of my challenge in dealing with Freedom House is that people don't want to remember' that part of our history, she said. Wilson said he has not heard of any opposition to his bill so far. Officers with the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which has occasionally protested when it sees efforts to scrub recognition of Confederate leaders from the public square, did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment Tuesday. A public hearing on Wilson's legislation is scheduled for January 25.","Alexandria, Virginia may strike down an 'antiquated' law that requires new streets to be named after Confederate leaders .

From a rare photo of Audrey Hepburn relaxing in the pool to a snap of Rod Stewart cuddling up to a mare and foal, Terry O'Neill's work includes some of the most intimate celebrity portraits ever taken. Now the British photographer's work is the subject of a new retrospective which charts his 50-year career on the frontline of fame. Among the stars to appear in the photographs on display at the Little Black Gallery in Chelsea are Frank Sinatra, O'Neill's former wife Faye Dunaway and Brigitte Bardot. Stunning: This unusually intimate portrait of Audrey Hepburn relaxing in the pool was taken in 1967 . Backstage: Elizabeth Taylor photographed putting her make-up on in her dressing room in 1977 . Others featured in the exhibition include Elizabeth Taylor, David Bowie, Joan Collins and iconic 60s model, Jean Shrimpton. So how did Terry O'Neill, a man whose career began, rather humbly, as a member of the photographic unit at London's Heathrow Airport, become one of the UK's most famous post-war photographers? Rather wonderfully, it all began with a chance encounter with the then Home Secretary, Rab Butler, who O'Neill snapped as he was nodding off while waiting for a flight. The photo hit the headlines and O' Neill moved to Fleet Street, where as a staff photographer for the now defunct Daily Sketch, he photographed everyone from Laurence Olivier to the Rolling Stones. Along with contemporaries, David Bailey, who also has a retrospective this year, Terence Donovan and Brian Duffy, O'Neill had, by the mid-1960s, become one of the UK's most sought-after photographers. Iconic: Joan Collins photographed at home in the 1970s and an unusual 1975 portrait of David Bowie . Glamorous: Faye Dunaway pictured at the Beverley Hills Hotel, the morning after winning the Oscar for Network . Intimate: Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in 1971 (left) and Tony Curtis on the set of The Boston Strangler . The Queen, Winston Churchill and The Beatles all featured in his work, but it was in Hollywood that he cemented his reputation for portraits that showed the subject in an unexpectedly intimate light.'I was suddenly being invited onto the film sets of the most beautiful women in the world, from Bardot to Elizabeth Taylor,' he remembers in a memoir penned for his website. 'Rock bands and musicians let me go backstage – in the days when photographers weren’t allowed. 'One minute I’d be on the set of a Bond movie, the next I’d be at a Hollywood studio hanging out with the biggest stars in the world.' He would later go on to marry one of his subjects, Bonnie and Clyde star Faye Dunaway, at the time one of the most famous women in the world. Four-legged friends: Rod Stewart gets up close and personal with a mare and foal in Old Windsor in 1971 . Close-up: Iconic model Jean Shrimpton photographed with actor Terence Stamp in 1963 . Controversial: A 1968 portrait taken for Esquire magazine featuring actress Raquel Welch tied to a cross . Both muse and model, O'Neill's portraits of Dunaway are among his most iconic, with some, including a wonderful shot of her relaxing poolside after winning the Oscar for Network in 1977, featured in the new retrospective.Speaking about O'Neill and his impact on 20th century photography, Tamara Beckwith, co-founder of The Little Black Gallery and a long-standing friend of the photographer, said:'It goes without saying that Terry is one of the greatest photographers we have ever produced on these shores.'It is only fitting that we should celebrate his achievement with an exhibition of his most iconic images.'The Best of Terry O'Neill opens today at The Little Black Gallery in Chelsea and runs until the 1st March.

Also taking to the catwalk at Hong Kong Fashion Week was Burma's Mogok Pauk Pauk, one of the few designers to emerge from the country, and who began her career as a bridal specialist in Mandalay. Her training was clearly in evidence, as she plumped for a palette focused on bride-friendly gold, cream and ivory.

A study found that adults believe foods to be healthier if they were advertised by loveable cartoon characters when they were young . He convinced us that a sugary cereal was ‘Grrreat’ as children. But Tony the Tiger and friends could still be affecting our views as adults. A study found that adults believe foods to be healthier if they were advertised by loveable cartoon characters when they were young. The researchers, from London’s City University, said that affectionate feelings for the likes Tony the Tiger, the ‘face’ of Kellogg’s Frosties, endure for decades. As a result, we may believe the brands are healthier than they really are. Paul Connell, of the University’s Cass Business School, said: ‘People should check the labels of products they’ve loved since childhood. ‘It’s possible that affectionate feelings for brand characters mean they are overlooking relevant nutritional information.’ Dr Connell began by asking almost 200 British adults how much they liked Tony the Tiger and fellow Kellogg’s mascot Coco the Monkey. Tony the Tiger has featured in adverts for Frosties since the early 1950s, while Coco the Monkey only popped up in ads for Cocoa Pops in the mid-1980s. The volunteers were also asked how healthy they believed the products to be. Results revealed that the older adults – who would have seen Tony the Tiger but not Coco the Monkey as children -  believed the Frosties to be better for them than the Coco Pops. However, younger adults, who would have seen both cartoon characters as children, rated the two cereals as being equally good for them. The study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, also found that older, but not younger adults, held the tiger in more affection than the monkey. Further experiments showed that those with the fondest memories of cartoon characters resisted changing their minds. Other cartoon characters featured in the study included Ronald McDonald who has been used to promote the burger chain since the 1960s . Plus, a cartoon character’s influence is not limited to the food that was originally advertised – with a familiar face helping boost the perceived health of another product made by the same brand. Other cartoon characters featured in the study included Ronald McDonald, who has been used to promote the burger chain since the 1960s. The researchers said that our ability to understand and evaluate advertising increase with age. As memories formed in childhood are particularly strong, adverts from that time may influence our beliefs for many years. Dr Connell said: ‘We suggest that parents discuss the persuasive nature of advertising with their children, and encourage them to develop critical thinking skills in response to advertising messages. ‘They may wish to point out that commercials use funny stories and exciting characters to entertain the viewer, but that commercials may not provide all the important information about the product. 'For very young children, parents might want to limit the amount of advertising that their children see until the children are old enough to have these conversations.’","The researchers said that affectionate feelings for the likes Tony the Tiger endure for decades .

Well, that is unless you're a dissatisfied guest of the Georgian House in Glasgow. After a string of critical comments were made on Trip Advisor about 'grubby rooms' and 'nasty breakfasts', a former manager of the hotel began to respond to guests - telling them that they could hardly expect better given the cheap price of the hotel. Writing under the name of 'georgianhouse1000, Owner at The Georgian House', the unapologetic member of staff, named as Virginia Giovanni, hurled back retorts to the disgruntled customers.

Telling them that they 'pay little, they get little' and refusing to apologise for their bad experiences, the staff member then told them to 'go the Hilton' if they wanted better food. It is now understood that the manager has left the hotel, which charges from £29.99 a night, after being dismissed by owner Elizabeth Morris, the Daily Record reported. One unhappy guest summarised their experience as nasty breakfast, grubby room', as they complained: 'The room, which was very small and cramped, and shower room were not cleaned during our 4 night stay, bins not emptied, glasses not washed, one towel each, not changed, no hand towels, no shampoo and the very cheapest hand wash and shower gel. 'We had to go looking for a replacement toilet roll one night as there was none in our shower room! 'The breakfast was terrible. A continental breakfast was (laughingly!!) served.' They signed off with the comment: 'Altogether this was very disappointing, it was possibly the worst B and B accommodation I have ever stayed in. My advice would be to go elsewhere!' The customer is not always right: The criticisms were met with withering disdain from the staff member .

One guest from Amsterdam wrote: 'Apart from the location, there is absolutely no positive remark we can make about The Georgian House. 'We do not recommend anybody to stay at The Georgian House. 'There are many other great hotels in the surroundings of The Georgian House that are better (and mostly cheaper as well)!' But the former manager retorted: 'With only one person to look after the place what do you expect. Think about what you paid. ' One reviewer took to Trip Advisor to write: 'Nice location,with clean fresh beds (which creaked terribly if you moved) but lacking in everything else. 'Staff were not friendly, in fact we hardly saw them apart from when they showed us to our room.' The staff member refused to accept responsibility for the complaints that guests had . Instead of apologising, the staff member retorted to criticism with asking customers not to demand so much . To which the former manager responded: 'We are a cheap hotel so what do you expect.

After getting sick during the final qualifying races in Ridnaun, Italy, Lanny Barnes thought her Olympic dreams were over after she was the final competitor eliminated and assumed her sister was telling her she would race for her in Sochi. Both biathletes, from Colorado, have been to the Olympics before - Lanny has been to the previous two Winter Olympics, and Tracy made the team back in 2006. It was only later on a walk in the Italian Alps that Tracy told her what was really happening: She would give up her spot on the team so Lanny, a three-time Olympian who finished just behind her, would qualify for the team and compete in Sochi instead.

Kevin Abar, assistant special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New Mexico, says distributors are selling methamphetamine tinted blue in the Four Corners region. That trend mirrors AMC's hit drama Breaking Bad, which depicted an Albuquerque-based meth operation that cooked up the drug with a blue hue. Blue meth is popping up all over New Mexico and it's dyed with chemicals that make drug users violently ill . Blue meth was popularized by the television show Breaking Bad in which Walter White cooks the purest form of the drug . Abar says tinting meth blue is a way for distributors to advertise and brand their product. He also says the blue meth being sold makes people sick. He says it has been cut with chemicals to make it blue and is not the 'pure' product portrayed on Breaking Bad. Business Insider reports that meth doesn't actually come out blue once it's made, so dealers have been cutting the meth with chemicals to give the drug the famed appearance it has on the show. 'We are we are seeing an increase in blue meth up in the Four Corners, and into the Farmington region. It's actually being moved and pushed by various distributors,' Kevin Abar Homeland security Investigations told KOB. He also said that even though the meth is bad, people are likely to keep coming back for more anyway. 'We're concerned that individuals may find it sexy and want to try it and utilize the drug and it's very addictive,' he said. KOB reports that even trying meth once can make a person an addict. They spoke with Jose Plata, an addict who tried the drug once when he was 14 years old. Since then he's been in and out of jail on various drug charges. Kevin Abar of Homeland Security Investigations warns of the dangers and addictive qualities of meth . Try it once and you're hooked: Jose Plata tried the drug when he was 14 and has been in and out of jail ever since . 'I regret it and I hope people will get and understanding of how crazy this drug is. It ruins your life,' Plata said. 'All it does is end you up in a place like this jail, institutions, death.' Not only will meth put people in jail, it can make users fatally ill--especially if its blue. 'Its truly bad,' Abar said, 'It's a bad meth that's created a lot of individuals getting sick from utilizing it.' Business Insider says that blue meth has popped up in other regions such as Kansas City in 2010 and was sold for 50 per cent more than the colorless variety even though the drugs were equal in strength. The blue meth has also become popular in Oklahoma City, where authorities confiscated $2.3 million worth of the drug in October. Abar says agents also have stumbled upon red-colored meth. Breaking Bad last year ended its popular run after five seasons.","Meth doesn't actually turn blue when it's made so drug dealers are dying it with dangerous chemicals to make it more like the meth on Breaking Bad .

Scientists are investigating possible links between the 'endogenous retroviruses', which are hardwired into DNA, and modern diseases such as AIDs and cancer. Researchers compared DNA from Neanderthals and another group of ancient humans called Denisovans with that obtained from cancer patients. Researchers compared DNA from Neanderthals (skull, pictured) and another group of ancient humans called Denisovans . They found evidence of Neanderthal and Denisovan viruses in the modern DNA, suggesting that they originated in a common ancestor more than half a million years ago. Neanderthals co-existed with our ancestors in Europe for thousands of years, but belonged to a different human sub-species. They eventually became extinct around 30,000 years ago. Around 8% of human DNA is made up of endogenous retroviruses, or ERVs, which are DNA sequences left by viruses which pass from generation to generation. They form part of the 90per cent of the genome, sometimes called 'junk' DNA, that contains no instruction codes for making proteins. The analysis included 'snippets' of  the mystery DNA  - neither human nor Neanderthal . Dr Gkikas Magiorkinis, from Oxford University’s Department of Zoology, who co-led the research, said: 'I wouldn’t write it off as ‘junk’ just because we don’t know what it does yet. 'Under certain circumstances, two ‘junk’ viruses can combine to cause disease. We’ve seen this many times in animals already. ERVs have been shown to cause cancer when activated by bacteria in mice with weakened immune systems.' The Oxford team now plans to look for possible links between these ancient viruses, belonging to the HML2 virus family, and cancer and HIV/Aids. 'How HIV patients respond to HML2 is related to how fast a patient will progress to Aids, so there is clearly a connection there,' said Dr Magiorkinis. 'HIV patients are also at much higher risk of developing cancer, for reasons that are poorly-understood. It is possible that some of the risk factors are genetic, and may be shared with HML2. 'They also become reactivated in cancer and HIV infection, so might prove useful as a therapy target in the future.' Co-author Dr Robert Belshaw, from the University of Plymouth, said: 'Using modern DNA sequencing of 300 patients, we should be able to see how widespread these viruses are in the modern population. 'We would expect viruses with no negative effects to have spread throughout most of the modern population, as there would be no evolutionary pressure against it. 'If we find that these viruses are less common than expected, this may indicate that the viruses have been inactivated by chance or that they increase mortality, for example through increased cancer risk.' The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was funded by the Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council. Our modern language can be traced back to Neanderthals living half a million years ago, scientists have claimed. Research increasingly seems to indicate that our close cousins, the Neanderthals, were much more similar to us than imagined. Dutch researchers argue that the last common ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals around half a million years ago, shared speech and language with modern humans. They believe that the origins of out modern language are ten times older than previously thought. The scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the Netherlands are interested in the implications for understanding present day linguistic diversity. Popular opinion is that they spoke in primitive grunts, but Neanderthal man successfully inhabited vast swathes of western Eurasia for several hundreds of thousands of years, during harsh ages and milder interglacial periods. Psycholinguistics researchers Dan Dediuand Stephen Levinson, said that far from being slow brutes, their cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours. The duo, who have looked at past findings in detail, argue that essentially modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans (another form of humanity known mostly from their genome). Their interpretation of scarce evidence contradicts a popular scenario believed by most language scientists, who think our modern language began with a sudden emergence of modernity presumably due to one or a few genetic mutations that gave rise to language.","Scientists investigated links between 'endogenous retroviruses', which are hard-wired into .

As smartphones become cheaper and more available, instant messaging is on the rise, while the number of texts sent falls dramatically . OMG! The text message is on its way out a little over 20 years after it arrived to revolutionise how the world communicates. New and cheaper ‘instant message’ alternatives available from smartphones connected to the web, such as Snapchat and WhatsApp, are taking over. The first text was sent on December 3, 1992, when British engineer Neil Papworth, 22, used his computer to send the message ‘Merry Christmas’ to a mobile phone. The number of texts sent in Britain peaked at 39.7billion in 2011, having sparked the new language of text speak, from OMG (Oh My God) to LOL (Laugh Out Loud) and XOXO, meaning hugs and kisses. However, this year the number is predicted to fall to 21billion, less than half the 50billion ‘instant messages’ that will be sent. The pattern is being repeated around the world, where the number of texts sent last year is thought to have fallen by seven billion to 145billion. The beauty of the instant message is that it can be sent cheaply through a smartphone app over the internet, rather than as a phone message via the mobile network, which can cost 15p a time. Users, so far mainly teenagers, can also communicate with several people simultaneously and punctuate their messages with brightly coloured icons. Snapchat, which is estimated to be used by up to half of all schoolchildren, allows users to send images, videos or text – known as Snaps – that disappear from the recipient’s phone after a maximum of ten seconds. But the app has sparked concern over its use by teenagers for sending explicit pictures of themselves, a practice known as sexting. The figures highlighting the rise of the instant message are included in a study by accountants Deloitte. A spokesman said: ‘We have reached a tipping point. But the usage of mobile phones to send messages is stronger than ever. This year, trillions of instant messages will be sent in place of a text message.’ According to the telecom prediction survey, the number of texts sent last year fell 7bn to 145bn, while the number of instant messages sent through apps rose to 160bn. Head of telecoms research at Deloitte, . Paul Lee, said: 'While text messaging has been growing in volume since it started, it has to come to an end of it's heyday. The number of SMS messages sent is predicted to make a steady decline, while the number of instant messages sent is set to increase dramatically. Factors are thought to be both financial and generational . 'There has been a moderate decline in text volumes for a couple of years, and what's driving it is growth in alternative services like Whatsapp, Snapchat and mobile e-mail. 'This means that there have been declining revenues from text recently, with more people being inclined to take out mobile broadband packages. 'companies losing revenue from falling SMS use will be able to make it up in an increase of broadband packages, and we're predicting that mobile broadband revenue will overtake text revenue  for the first time.' Experts say the reason for this is costs. Texts cost 10p to send, with a bit less to deliver, and IM apps like Whatsapp are free for the time being. Lee said: 'Quite a few IM services have no profit - many are in a start-up . phase right now. Whatsapp has 400 million users a month, and charges 60p a year to use it. 'iMessage is free with an iPhone. Snapchat is accumulating . users rather than charging them, whereas text messaging costs money. 'Some of the companies charge for things . like emoticons and games, they're diversifying significantly, but they're still looking at ways to generate revenue.' SMS still makes up around 98 per cent of revenue for mobile phone companies, because everybody still uses it across the world. 'I think it'll continue to exist because for now its the common denominator in all mobile phones' Lee said. 'Unless something else . comes up that takes over as the common denominator then its safe - if you want to get a message to someone you have to use SMS. The report predicts that in 2014 the number of texts sent will fall even further to only 140bn, while the number of instant messages will increase dramatically to around 300bn. Whatsapp (left), which was released in 2009, has since overtaken SMS as the predominant form of messaging in the UK, and iMessage (right), which was released on the Apple iPhone in 2007, was one of the first most readily available IM services, following on from Blackberry's BBM . It . is thought that younger users are turning away from traditional texting . in favour of instant messaging services that offer lower prices and . more customisation. In . addition, the cheapness and availability of smartphone technology is . contributing towards the rise of IM, with cheaper handsets meaning more . people who wouldn't usually buy smartphones, like senior citizens, are . becoming regular users. The price of the technology also . means that soon mobile phone companies will stop making traditional . handsets, and people will have no choice but to convert to smartphones. In . the UK the percentage of people over 55 with a smartphone was 29 per . cent in 2012, and is set to rise to around 47 per cent in 2014. However, only 13 per cent of older smartphone owners used IM, preferring to use their smartphones to make calls and send texts. Suggestions show that it could be a generation gap that makes the difference. Paul Lee said: 'IM is a tremendous utility for delivering messages for nothing. 'For young people its phenomenal, because it's free and they have devices to utilise this. For older its irrelevant.' SMS is still worth . around £60bn, because of its functionality; Texts still work in any . country, on any network, on any handset. Traditional SMS still stands to make more money in 2014 than IM, and the report predicts that this trend will continue until 2018. BlackBerry . can claim to have started the IM trend when its BBM service started in . 2006, but the IM trend took off when the iPhone was released in 2007. This . release brought with it services like iMessage, Facebook Messenger and . Whatsapp, released in 2009, with these services overtaking traditional . texts in the UK last year. A . Carphone Warehouse spokesperson said: 'With the massive increase in . popularity of instant messaging apps, it’s not surprising that the . number of texts sent has fallen so dramatically. 'Consumers . are no longer tied to text messages or phone calls as a means of . communication and are using free messaging services like Whatsapp, . iMessage, Facebook and Skype instead. 'We’ve . seen significant change across our stores as customers are more . interested in enquiring about a tariff’s data limits - and whether a . phone comes with a free messaging app or function pre-installed - as . opposed to the number of text messages and minutes available.","Number of texts sent in the UK has fallen for the first time in two decades .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 03:44 EST, 2 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:18 EST, 2 May 2013 . One of London's top prep schools has brought in an unofficial ban on 'best friends' in case other children are left hurt and ostracised. Pupils at the £4,500-a-term Thomas's private day school in Battersea should instead have 'lots of good friends' to maintain harmony in the classroom. Headteacher Ben Thomas believes that having best friends leads to possessive relationships and more tearful fall-outs at school. Concerns: The head at Thomas's private day school in Battersea, London, believes that having best friends can be damaging for young children . Mr Thomas maintains there is no official policy on the matter, but some parents claim they have been told their child should not have a best friend. 'There is sound judgment behind it. You can get very possessive friendships, and it is much easier if they share friendships and have a wide range of good friends rather than obsessing too much about who their best friend is,' Mr Thomas told the Daily Telegraph. 'I would certainly endorse a policy which says we should have lots of good friends, not a best friend. I would be happy to make it school policy, although it would need to be age-appropriate. 'By the time they are 11, 12 or 13 they are making up their own minds. But when they are aged between four and ten, it would be helpful for parents, teachers and children.' Mr Thomas said that the problems linked to having best friends were particularly problematic when it comes to young girls. They often have 'triangle' friendships where one child ends up being left out and upset. Critics: Experts say that it is impossible to stop children choosing best friends and that it is important socially for them to deal with emotional knocks . The issue of banning best friends has been discussed by teaching experts, but critics are warn it is preventing youngsters from learning about the ups and downs of life. Educational psychologist Gaynor Sbuttoni, who provides counselling for children in London, said at a conference last year that teachers should not be interfering with friendships and that it is natural for children to want a best friend. 'If they break up, they have to feel the pain because then they're learning to deal with it,' she said. 'As parents, we're all trying to prevent our children feeling pain, but what we should be doing is helping them bear it and find solutions, rather than trying to take it away.' Judith Mortell, also an educational psychologist, told The Sunday Times some schools view the policy as a waste of valuable curriculum time, while others see it as part of a holistic approach to eduction. National Association of Teachers general secretary, Russel Hobby, added: 'I don't see how you can stop people forming close friendships. We make and lose friends throughout our lives.'","Head at Thomas's prep says pupils should have  'lots of good friends' instead .

Whitehall officials are believed to have scrapped technology used in meetings amid fears they are being used by the Chinese government to eavesdrop. The Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Crown Prosecution Service are all said to have stopped using equipment because of concerns they are being intercepted by the Communist state. It is believed products manufactured by telecoms company, Huwaei, could be among the devices which pose a threat because of possible 'vulnerabilities'. Allegations: The telecom giants are believed to be one of the companies whose products have vulnerbailities which could be exploited by the Chinese government . A Parliamentary security committee warned last year that the Chinese government might be able to ‘intercept covertly or disrupt traffic passing through Huawei-supplied networks’. According to The Sunday Mirror, there are fears the equipment can be accessed remotely by the Chinese state and used to record top-level meetings and potentially extract highly-sensitive information. The company is not said to be directly involved in the bugging of technology and have denied having close links with the Chinese state. They have also refuted claims that they have been involved in any government contracts. The Ministry of Justice is thought to have bought video-conferencing equipment in 2011 to set up conference calls with various meetings around the country. All smiles: George Osborne shares a laugh with Huawei CEO and founder Ren Zhengfei last October in Beijing . Huwa technology has already been banned from contracts in the US and Australia over the perceived vulnerabilities in their system. The former head of the Minister of Defence’s cyber security unit, Major General Jonathon Shaw claimed ministers were ‘compromising’ on security and ‘dealing with the devil’ in opening up to the firm. George Osborne welcomed a £125million investment by the company last year. During a trade visit, the Chancellor was seen laughing and joking with the founder Ren Zhengfei. At the time, Mr Osborne said: ‘There are some Western governments that have blocked Huawei from making investments. Not Britain. Quite the opposite.’","Ministry of Justice believed to have dumped equipment over concerns .

The pilots of a Southwest Airlines flight that mistakenly landed at the wrong Missouri airport were grounded Monday, less than a day after they touched down at a small airfield that gave them only half as much room as normal to stop the jet. Southwest declined to name the veteran pilots of Flight 4013, which was traveling Sunday evening from Chicago's Midway Airport to Branson Airport but instead landed at tiny Taney County Airport seven miles away. No one was hurt, but after the 124 passengers were let off the plane, they noticed the airliner had come dangerously close to the end of the runway, where it could have tumbled down a steep embankment if it had left the pavement.

'As soon as we touched down, the pilot . applied the brake very hard and very forcibly,' said Scott Schieffer, a . Dallas attorney. 'I was wearing a seatbelt, but I was lurched forward . because of the heavy pressure of the brake. You could smell burnt . rubber, a very distinct smell of burnt rubber as we were stopping.' Scheiffer tweeted that the pilot informed passengers that they were at a smaller airport. After the jet stopped, a flight attendant welcomed passengers to Branson, Schieffer said. Then, . after a few moments, 'the pilot came on and said, ""Ladies and . gentlemen, I'm sorry to tell you we landed at the wrong airport.""' Passengers were kept on board for about 75 minutes before the doors opened. 'We . have all deplaned from @SouthwestAir 4013, and the mood is somber now . that we realized we were 40 feet from the edge of a cliff,' Schieffer . tweeted.

'It . was surreal when I realized we could have been in real danger,' he . said. 'And instead of an inconvenience, it could have been a real . tragedy.' Mark Parent, . manager of the smaller airport also known as M. Graham Clark Downtown . Airport, described the distance as closer to 300 feet. He said the . runway is built partly on landfill.

No one was at the airport when the Southwest flight landed. Airport employees had gone home about an hour earlier but were called back after the unexpected arrival, Parent said. The Federal Aviation Administration was investigating, but agency spokesman Tony Molinaro declined to elaborate.

He said he had no explanation for why the jet landed at the county-owned airport, which primarily serves charter, corporate and general aviation flights. It was originally developed by the College of the Ozarks. Tony Molinaro, Federal Aviation Agency spokesman for its central region, says the FAA is investigating the incident.

Police nabbed Connecticut's William Bradley yesterday after spotting the YouTube clip called 'Hope Garden' when it was posted in October. In the seven-minute video, Bradley welcomed people to his 'garden' and said he was growing pot because he had cancer. He also begged for donations because he wanted to give away the buds to people who needed them for medical reasons. During the rambling clip, Bradley explained his predicament and occasionally stopped to smell the plants. 'This bouquet of flowers is for everyone.

These days it’s more about copying someone else’s. Our growing desire to imitate outfits worn by everyone from Hollywood stars to the Duchess of Cambridge has fuelled a 38 per cent increase in global sales at ASOS, Britain’s biggest specialist fashion website. The 13-year-old company, originally called As Seen On Screen, rang up sales of £335.7million in the four months to the end of last year with cut-price versions of celebrities’ designer outfits. Success: Online retailer ASOS has posted a huge jump in sales in the run-up to Christmas after a steady rise in retail sales every year over the last decade . Its best sellers were party dresses, . oversized coats and Christmas jumpers, while publicity from fashion . leaders such as Samantha Cameron, who wore a £42 ASOS pencil dress to . the Conservative Party Conference in October, helped other lines fly off . its virtual shelves. The . figures cap an outstanding year for the firm. Its shares have soared by . 157 per cent in the last 12 months, giving it a market value of . £5.34billion – the equivalent of five Debenhams and only £2.3billion . less than 130-year-old Marks & Spencer, which is the UK’s biggest . clothing retailer. ASOS’s . international websites, which operate in the US, France, Germany, Spain, . Russia, Italy, Australia and China, have also contributed to its . success. Europe was the . star performer in the four months to December 31, with sales rising 69 . per cent, while revenues increased 28 per cent in the US and 19 per cent . elsewhere in the world. 'Retail sales in the UK were particularly strong.’ ASOS’s . performance provides a further sign that the festive season was a . stellar one for online retailers, as well as those with a strong . internet presence, while bricks and mortar shops lagged behind. British . Retail Consortium figures show there were 3.7 per cent fewer shoppers . in the high street in December compared with the same month last year. ASOS, founded in 2000 by former . advertising executive Nick Robertson, the current CEO, has been the big . success story in British retailing in recent years, with its . fast-changing fashions snapped up by internet-savvy twentysomethings and . attracting fans including United States First Lady Michelle Obama and . singer Rita Ora. The company blamed a vicious high . street price war and an unseasonably warm October as like-for-like . fashion sales fell 2.1 per cent year on year for the 13 weeks to . December 28. A spokesman from Marks & Spencer said . it would never comment on a third party retailer, but added that the . company's online sales figures had gone up by 22.7per cent in the . quarter leading up to Christmas. Rising star: ASOS, whose shares have nearly trebled over the last year, said today that its retail sales rose 38per cent to £335.7 million in the four months to December 31 - the first four months of its 2013-14 fiscal year . Debenhams . has also struggled in recent years, with 2014 set to mark the fourth . year of consecutive earnings decline, from £174million in 2010 to . £95million this year, as it has shifted into goods with lower profit . margins. Debenhams has . blamed tough price competition and disappointing online business for . underlying sales growth of just 0.1 per cent over Christmas. ASOS's hike in profits compares with a rise of 47per cent in the fourth quarter of the 2012-13 year and analysts' consensus forecast for growth of 36per cent, putting it firmly among the sector's major winners in the key festive trading season. High praise: The firm has attracted fans including United States First Lady Michelle Obama, who wore a red and white ASOS dress while hitting the campaign trail with her husband in 2012 . The firm said it had 7.9 million active customers as of December 31, a 41per cent year-on-year rise. ASOS's . UK sales jumped 37per cent to £133.7million, with international sales . up 38per cent to 202 million pounds, with sales in Europe particularly . strong with growth of 69 percent. ASOS said retail gross margin rose 90 basis points year-on-year in the period, reflecting tighter stock control. 'These results were driven by significant . improvements to our customer proposition, including better delivery . options, additional payment methods and the roll out of our premier . service in key international markets,' said Mr Robertson. Shares in ASOS closed Monday at 6,860p. Dan . Wagner, Founder and CEO of Powa Technologies said that ASOS's success . was down to their engagement and interaction with customers - many of . whom are young women - and warned that other retailers should follow . suit, or face the consequences. Founded in 2000 by former advertising executive Nick Robertson, ASOS originally started life as As Seen On Screen - selling versions of outfits spotted on celebrities. In 2004 the company launched its first own brand, ASOS Women, which has been worn by celebrities including Michelle Obama, Rita Ora and Rhianna. As well as clothing for men and women, ASOS also offers maternity wear, childrens' clothes, jewellery and beauty products - making it a one-stop shop for customers. In 2006 the company's only warehouse was damaged in a fuel explosion, but the firm quickly bounced back and continued to grow. In 2012 ASOS.com became the most visited fashion website in the world, per day 18-34 year olds. ASOS now boasts websites in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian and Chinese, as well as offices in France, Australia, Germany, the US and London. The firm allows shoppers to interact with the brand via Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, and also produces its own magazine. The website also boasts a 'Marketplace', selling items by lesser-known and independent designers while iPad and iPhone apps make it easier for shoppers to get their fashion fix while on the go. 'Retailers are waking up to the fact . that they need to personally engage with their customers, tailoring the . shopping experience to the individual and delivering across a multitude . of different channels,' he said. 'ASOS's’ trading statement figures put them firmly with the festive season . ""winners"" after doing exceptionally well and becoming one of the biggest . retail successes this year. 'It’s this shift in consumer buying . patterns that has emphasised the importance of bringing the customer a . real-time experience – ""Real-time"" being the buzzword of 2014. And the . high streets approach to customer interaction and engagement is going to . have to change if they want to see the year out. 'Technology . is drastically changing the retail landscape as well as what customers . expect from their shopping experience. Bluetooth beacons have become the . latest trend in delivering real-time deals to customers walking through . their shop doors. 'It’s technology like this that’s allowing the high . streets to keep up with online giants such as ASOS, bringing instant, . accurate gratification to customers. 'Everyone’s . talking about Click-and-Collect and online shopping, but I think what . will be really interesting this year, is what the high street retailers . do to bring back customer engagement to the shop floor and compete with . the likes of ASOS.' ASOS's . performance provides a further sign that the Christmas season was a . stellar one for online retailers and those with a strong internet . presence. Figures from the British Retail . Consortium (BRC) last week showed web sales grew at the fastest pace for . more than three years in December, up 19.2per cent, with sparkling . performances from chains such as John Lewis and Next fuelled by online . trade. Freddie George, retail analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said trading at ASOS was 'impressive, but broadly in line with market expectations'. Europe was the star performer for ASOS in the four month period, with sales rising by 69per cent, while revenues increased 28per cent in the US and 19per cent elsewhere internationally. It recently launched in China, marking its eighth local language site outside the UK.

There are four insurmountable problems no marriage can survive, according to a leading divorce expert. And just having an affair isn't one of them. Blogging on the Huffington Post, psychotherapist and author Micki McWade said cheating on a spouse is often just a symptom of one of four deeper underlying issues - issues which, she says, are the ones to ultimately end a marriage. There are four problems no marriage can survive, according to divorce expert Micki McWade . McWade - who describes herself as a collaborative divorce coach, a parent educator and collaborative trainer - outlines these marital dead-ends as: partners ceasing to be partners; chronic complaining and blame-throwing; narcissism and addiction. She explains... Ceasing to be partners: When one partner feels the other is immature, irresponsible, untrustworthy or selfish, the marital dynamic will crumble, destroying intimacy and sexual attraction. One partner will then 'detach'. Domestic abuse is the most extreme version of this. There's often no turning back from detachment, so it's important to recognize and start marriage counseling before breaking point. A marriage counselor can't manufacture a connection, only strengthen it. Domestic abuse is the most severe form of 'detachment', when one partner no longer feels equal to the other . Chronic complaining and blame-throwing: When marital problems are not resolved to the satisfaction of both, resentment builds - and this erodes relationships. Solving a problem by compromise is more important than being 'right'. Individuals who cannot accept accountability are doomed to fail in relationships. Narcissism: Everyone is narcissistic to some extent, but this is problematic when partners are unable to empathise with each other and instead compete over issues such as who works harder, who spends more time with the children, who had a tougher day. When partners don't understand the other's contribution, each assume the other has it easier and neither feels understood. A problem with addiction - be it to drugs, gambling or alcohol - will always take priority over marriage and family . Addiction: Addiction will always be an addict's main focus above marriage and family, and their partner will feel angry and embarrassed by their lack of consideration for others. If a user is unable to give up their habit they will shift blame onto their partner, who may try to hold the relationship together for a while - especially if children are involved - but will eventually give up if there is no recovery. Parents will often try to stay together for the sake of their children, but once these four problems have run too deep there is little hope for a marriage . McWade explains it is important to correct marital issues before they become habitual behaviours and are imposible to change. She says: 'It's difficult for couples to change . long-standing relationship patterns by themselves because people tend to . argue for their own points of view. Communication doesn't get anywhere . without a neutral perspective. Patterns must be recognized and . interrupted.'

A prisoner has been banned from receiving his weekly copy of Shooting Times by jail chiefs because it contained pictures of guns after the Government cracked down on inmate perks. But convict Gregg Hill bemoaned the decision and said he loved flicking through the countryside magazine, which also includes articles on 'farming, conservation and fishing’. Writing in Inside Time this week, ‘the national newspaper for prisoners’, Hill said the decision by bosses came after the recent crackdown on 'holiday camp prisons' by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Crack down: A prisoner has been banned from receiving his weekly copy of Shooting Times by jail chiefs in Cambridgeshire because it contained pictures of guns after the Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (right) curbed inmate perks . Mr Grayling announced this week that prisoners will no longer have an automatic right to a TV in their cell, will have all 18-rated DVDs confiscated and be forced to wear a prison uniform in their first two weeks inside. But Hill, who is currently enjoying a stay at HMP Littlehey, a Category C prison in Cambridgeshire, decried the decision and described himself as a ‘country boy’ at heart. He said Shooting Times, which has a weekly circulation of just under 22,200, and was first published in 1882, did not tell him how to make a machine gun. He moaned: ‘Not only are we being treated like impressionable children by being denied the right to buy 18 rated DVDs, but it appears I can no longer get my magazine The Shooting Times because it contains guns. Inside: Prison chiefs at HMP Littlehey, a Category C prison in Cambridgeshire, have banned an inmate from reading his favourite magazine because it contained pictures of guns . ‘The Shooting Times, for these who don't know, is full of articles on shooting, fieldcraft, farming, conservation, fishing, dog breeding and cookery. ‘Nowhere in its pages does it inform you how to make an AK47 out of everyday items you might find in a prison cell.’ ‘I am a country boy and these things are my interest.’ He added: ‘Next they'll be banning performance car magazines in case someone builds a Ferrari out of prison-issue tracksuits.’ Mr Grayling said this week that it was wrong that some prisoners were 'watching daytime television while the rest of the country goes out to work'. He said: ‘For too long, there has been an expectation that privileges are an automatic right, given simply as a reward for staying out of trouble. ‘This cannot continue. Prisoners need to earn privileges, not simply through the avoidance of bad behaviour. 'But also by working, taking part in education or accepting the opportunities to rehabilitate themselves.’ The changes followed a review which criticised the ‘frills’ available to prisoners but unaffordable for ordinary families. A Prison Service spokesperson said today: 'Items such as this are not considered appropriate for prisoners.'","Inmate Gregg Hill banned from reading his favourite magazine .

Natasha Welch, 22, adopted Asian brown wood owl Haru when he was just a chick, but says that now he is seven months-old he has 'taken over' her life. Ms Welch, from Maidstone in Kent, said Haru has developed human characteristics since she hand-reared him from being a chick - and now has a taste for high-octane television. Taking over: Natasha Welch adopted Haru when he was just a chick, but says that now he is seven months old he is dominating her life. She says the Asian brown wood owl is convinced she is his mum . Ms Welch, who graduated from university with a fashion degree, now takes Haru around classrooms and fetes after setting up a craft workshop called ‘Owl About Art’. She said when he was tiny she had to feed him mice and 'supervise him' when he drank water to make sure he didn’t accidentally drown himself. Ms Welch added: 'When he was a chick it was like having a baby. He would wake me up crying and call for food in the middle of the night.' 'I would hand feed him 10 chicks and a couple of mice a day and have to be with him when he drank water, otherwise he could drown.'

The federal Attorney General's Office said later in a statement it had sent 11 helicopters and 70 federal investigators and officers to help return law and order to the state. Osorio Chong made his announcement after a meeting called by Michoacan state Gov. Fausto Vallejo following a weekend of firefights between drug traffickers and some of the vigilante groups that have sprung up by the dozens over the past year to confront the gangs. Congressman Ernesto Nunez of the Green Party, who was at the meeting in the state capital of Morelia, said the federal government is looking to have members of the self-defense groups join police departments.

Shooting broke out almost immediately in and around the town square. Only one injury was reported. Opponents and critics contend the vigilantes are backed by a rival cartel. The groups deny that.

Mr Dietrich, who was with his brother on a trip to Chugach National Forest, Alaska, said: 'My reaction was one of pure excitement and disbelief. I've often thought about seeing a bear cub standing on its rear legs like a human does, but I truly didn't expect to ever get a photograph of it. 'I certainly never dreamed I'd get an image of one 'waving' at me while standing in a river waiting for it's mother to bring back a salmon. As the cub stood up I knew this was my opportunity to get a photograph I would cherish and remember for a lifetime.

The mother bear left the shore and swam directly at us before diving to the bottom of the river in search of dying salmon. 'She would disappear for about 15 seconds and then appear randomly in front of us. Needless to say we were full of excitement and nervousness as we never knew where she was going to appear. 'She caught about seven salmon and the little cub was very excited and animated as she waited for her mother to bring back food to the shore.

Tragic: Christopher Groves, 38, and his nine-year-old son Connor were  killed when their sports car spun off a road flyover and plunged into the freezing River Clyde . A father and his nine-year-old son were killed when their sports car spun off a road flyover and plunged into a freezing river. Christopher Groves, 38, may have been blinded by the low winter sun when he lost control of his blue Honda S2000 while bringing schoolboy Connor home from a guitar lesson. Their car shot off a flyover on the A725 near Bothwell Bridge, Lanarkshire, and landed upside down in the icy waters of the River Clyde. Police divers were called in to pull the father and son from the car, but there was nothing that could be done to save them. Mr Groves, of Blantyre, Lanarkshire, was a financial advisor and had been married to wife Clare, 39, for 10 years. Police have confirmed Saturday’s incident is not being treated as suspicious and that no other vehicles were involved. Mrs Groves, who works for The Royal Bank of Scotland, is being comforted by relatives at their home but was too upset to comment. Mr Groves's stepfather Trevor Hadley said: 'It’s the worst possible thing that could happen. Clare is in bits. She has lost her husband and son in one go. 'It’s just a few weeks since we spent a wonderful Christmas at their house. 'Connor was a beautiful boy, so full of life and really bright.'

'Obviously the police will carry out a full investigation into the full circumstances of the case.

But speaking yesterday, he added that he will also not support those who ‘do not accept’ that the jury reached their own conclusions. His comments came after his name drew cries of ‘shame’ during a peaceful vigil outside Tottenham Police Station on Saturday afternoon. Police commanders feared criminal gangs could try to exploit simmering racial tensions reignited by the row over his death at the hands of police marksmen. Members of the Duggan family, who vowed ‘no justice, no peace’ outside the High Court, released 20 white doves during a minute’s silence. Last week a jury ruled a police officer was right to shoot the 29-year-old father-of-six dead after his minicab was stopped in Tottenham in August 2011. The death of the drug-dealing gangster, who collected a lethal 9mm pistol minutes earlier from an accomplice, sparked riots in towns and cities across England. Speaking on the BBC Andrew Marr Show yesterday, Mr Lammy said he was worried there are ‘different groups with different aces to grind jumping on the bandwagon’. ‘I have done a lot to support this family and will continue to do that but I will not share a platform with anarchist groups and people that do not accept that a jury laboured and reached a verdict,’ he added. ‘There is a legal process that continues, there is an IPCC investigation, and it is my job to continue to put pressure on that organisation. Pamela Duggan, mother of Mark Duggan, greets friends and family during a vigil outside Tottenham police station in London . ‘But anarchists and extreme protest groups ... I’m not prepared to share a platform and I have always been consistent on that.’ The inquest jury of seven women and three men, all drawn from the borough of Haringey, was thrust into the spotlight after their ruling last week. After listening to three months of evidence they found that although Duggan had thrown away his gun, the police officer was justified in shooting him. This was because they believed his dramatic testimony when he said his ‘honestly held belief’ was that the young thug was about to point a lethal weapon at him. Unprecedented scenes of violence and intimidation engulfed the High Court as supporters of Duggan screamed abuse at the jury, lawyers and police. Doves are released by members of Mark Duggan's family following a vigil outside Tottenham Police station on January 11 . Mark Duggan who was shot and killed by police in Tottenham, North London in 2011 . In the following hours, supporters of the Duggan family questioned the ruling and said they were considering a judicial review. The coroner is to ask the Duggan family for their views on how armed police should tackle dangerous criminals. Judge Keith Cutler, pictured, who in the past has admitted he enjoys having the power to show leniency, said their thoughts could influence his recommendations to the Home Secretary following the case. Judge Cutler has already faced questions about his handling of the inquest, with claims he treated the Duggan family with ‘kid gloves’. Mr Lammy’s party colleague Diane Abbott, who represents nearby Hackney North, also questioned the inquest outcome. The former frontbencher said she was ‘baffled’ and ‘startled’ by the jury’s ruling said there would be ‘questions to be asked’. But she faced criticism for appearing to second guess their conclusions and appeared on TV the next day to say she was not ‘challenging’ the decision. Police were relieved when Saturday’s vigil of more than 500 people passed without any serious confrontation. Local . community leaders had warned that anarchists were trying to cling onto . the family’s campaign as criminals warned of violence on social . networks. Carole Duggan, the dead man’s aunt, called for a fresh investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. ‘Mark did not get the justice he deserved from the inquest, so we have no alternative but to go back to basics, start at the beginning,’ she said. During the inquest, the Met said Duggan was a key member of a feared gang but his family insisted he was a happy-go-lucky family man. Officers remain on alert across the capital amid fears of a repeat of the riots which followed a similar protest outside Tottenham Police Station. Five people died and damage estimated at more than £200m was caused during four-days of mayhem after Duggan’s death almost three years ago.","The Labour MP for Tottenham also appeared to row back on previous comments made within hours of the jury’s decision last week .

"By . Lizzie Parry . PUBLISHED: . 07:54 EST, 3 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:27 EST, 3 November 2013 . Professor Linda Hogan, pictured last year giving an honorary medal to American Pie actor Seann Scott, is tipped as a candidate to become the first female cardinal . An Irish feminist is causing a stir in the Catholic world as rumours are rife the married 49-year-old could be set to join the world's 'most exclusive' club. Linda Hogan is being tipped as a contender to become the Vatican's first female cardinal. A woman has never held the title, and while current precedence states only ordained men can be appointed to the role, Pope Francis could be poised to make history. The leader of the Catholic church, elected eight months ago, has emerged as a liberal prompting speculation he will invite a woman to don the red hat and welcome the first female cardinal into the Vatican's fold. The reformist Argentinian pope has made no secret of the fact he aims to increase the role of women in the church, calling for 'a truly deep theology of women'. For 700 years a pope was free to elect whoever they wished to the role of cardinal. Pope Alexander VI made his illegitimate son, Cesare Borgia, a cardinal when he was 18 years old. Historians say no woman has sat in the Holy See's papal conclave since the position was created in the 12th Century and cardinals were given the responsibility of electing the pope. In 1917 a canon law instructed that a pope could only appoint ordained men as cardinals. But church historians believe Pope Francis could simply set aside that law and select a female cardinal should he wish to. No woman has ever been elected a cardinal since the position was created in the 12th Century. The conclave currently consists of 100 elderly men . A former Brazilian priest, Juan Arias, was the man who first put forward the prospect of an imminent appointment of a female cardinal, when he wrote the idea was 'not a joke', in the Spanish newspaper El Pais in September. He quoted an unnamed priest as saying: 'Knowing this Pope, he wouldn't hesitate before appointing a woman cardinal. Pope Francis could be poised to make history by appointing the first female cardinal . 'And he would indeed enjoy being the first Pope to allow women to participate in the selection of a new pontiff,' The Sunday Times reported. However, Father Federico Lombardi, the Pope's spokesman, has moved to downplay the speculation. He said last week: 'Stay calm, no nominations of women cardinals are due.' Pope Francis is expected to name at least 14 new cardinals ahead of his first consistory - a formal meeting of the Sacred College of Cardinals - in February. The conclave currently consists of 100 elderly males, criticised in recent years for their mismanagement of child abuse scandals. And while the debate rages, Professor Hogan, the vice-provost of Trinity College Dublin, is leading the pack of potential candidates for the historic post. While the academic has refrained from commenting on the speculation, colleagues have revealed her strong interest in theology, ethics and human rights. Gina Menzies, a Dublin theologian, said: 'She'd be quite radical. 'One of her strong beliefs is something Pope Francis has been hinting at, too: that the basis of moral theology starts from human experience.' Pope Francis is expected to name at least 14 new cardinals ahead of his first consistory - a formal meeting of the cardinals - in February. Speculation is rife a woman will be named among them . Hogan, who was a founding member of the International Association for Catholic Social Thought, is one of nine potential female cardinals listed by friend James Keenan, professor of theology at the Jesuit Boston College, on his Facebook page. Along with Professor Hogan, two candidates are from Brazil, three are African, one is Australian, another German and the ninth is from the Philippines. Were one of these women to be elected to the role by Pope Francis, they would become the most prominent and influential female in the Catholic Church, and could one day be elected to succeed the man who bestowed the honour upon them.","A canon law of 1917 states that only ordained men can take up the role .

A Briton who has been jailed since the 1980s for a double murder has sought to reopen the case by forcing the U.S government to hand over documents which could clear his name. Former self-made millionaire Krishna Maharaj, 74, who was once the second biggest racehorse owner in the UK, was convicted in 1987 of the murders of two men, Derrick and Duane Moo Young, in the Dupont Plaza hotel in central Miami. He spent 15 years on death row before his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 2002. Lawyers for Maharaj have contended for years that Colombian drug cartels were responsible for the deaths, and Tuesday’s a defense motion filed in state court represented the first time they were specific in their allegations. Former British millionaire Krishna Maharaj and his wife Marita (right) in a prison in Indiantown, Florida . Clive Stafford Smith (left), attorney for Krishna Maharaj and Maharaj's wife, Marita Maharaj, are hoping to overturn his conviction . The judge will consider the motion at the hearing and whether the files, believed to be held by U.S. federal agencies, should be released. The filing sets out testimony provided by several other former members of Colombian drug cartels, who have admitted that Mr Maharaj was not involved in the murder. Instead, the cartel members say the Moo Youngs were murdered on the orders of drug baron Pablo Escobar. ‘Krishna Maharaj was not involved in the murder of the Moo Youngs, and they had to be eliminated because they had lost Colombian drug money,’ according to one of the drug traffickers quoted in the defense motion. The lawyers wrote that the killings were . carried out by Escobar hit man Manuel Zuluaga, also known as ‘Cuchilla’ (the Blade); Jaime Vallejo Majia, a convicted cartel money launderer; . and hitman Jhon Henry ‘El Chino’ Rodriguez. Zuluaga died in 1993. Mr Maharaj pictured listening to proceedings during a week-long hearing at Metro-Dade Courthouse in Miami in 1997 .

Penny Brill, an assistant state attorney, said: ‘There is nothing in the (new) motion besides hearsay and inadmissible evidence.’ Prosecutors filed a 79-page response on Tuesday which described the defense motion as ‘nonsensical and wholly speculative’. Clive Stafford Smith, Mr Maharaj's counsel for more than 20 years and director of legal charity Reprieve, said: 'This is a test for the Florida prosecutors - are they interested in exonerating Kris Maharaj, an innocent man in a wheelchair, or do they want to defend Pablo Escobar for two of the many homicides that he ordered. 'It is also a test for the British Government - will they assist a British citizen to get the evidence he needs, or merely make statements about the need for fair trials?' During the hearing nearly six years ago, the family of the murder victims pleaded tearfully with the state clemency board to deny Maharaj's request. US prosecutors told the board that Maharaj had a fair trial and a series of appeal hearings and other investigations that have all come to the same conclusion. Lawyers for the Bar of England and Wales, the House of Lords and members of the European Parliament have asserted in the past that Maharaj's initial trial did not meet international standards.","Krishna Maharaj, 74, was once the UK's second biggest racehorse owner .

John Kerry topped a list of 'traitors' who Hillary Clinton's staff believed betrayed her during her bitter 2008 presidential primary battle with Barack Obama, a new book has revealed. The detailed list, which also included Democratic Party heavyweight Edward Kennedy, who died in 2009, was kept by Clinton's aides who ranked names on a seven-point scale, it is claimed. Kerry, who was Senator for Massachusetts at the time and went on to replace Clinton as Secretary of State in the Obama administration, was among those receiving the worst possible score, according to the book. Compiled blacklist: Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, addressing supporters during a South Dakota and Montana primary night event in 2008 . On the campaign trail: Then Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Barack Obama was endorsed by former presidential candidate John Kerry at this rally in January 2008 . HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton was written by political journalists Amie Parnes, from The Hill, and Jonathan Allen, from Politico. They claimed that also on the political hit-list were Senators Jay Rockefeller, Bob Casey and Patrick Leahy as well as House of Representatives members Chris Van Hollen, Rob Andrews and Baron Hill. Parnes and Allen write that year later Clinton aides 'would joke about the fates of folks who they felt had betrayed them. ""Bill Richardson: investigated; John Edwards: disgraced by scandal; Chris Dodd: stepped down,"" one said to another. ""Ted Kennedy,"" the aide continued, lowering his voice to a whisper for the punch line, ""dead"".' Kerry was the Democratic Party's standard-bearer in the 2004 presidential election and President Clinton had campaigned hard for him in the final stretch of that campaign, even though he was recovering from major heart surgery at the time. In 2008, however, Kerry did not merely endorse Obama; he did so at a very vulnerable time for the then-senator from Illinois. Having won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, Obama then lost the New Hampshire primary to Clinton despite holding a large lead in almost all opinion polls. Hillary Clinton's aides kept a detailed blacklist of 'traitors' during the 2008 primary campaign . Two days later, Kerry appeared at a rally with Obama in South Carolina. 'Who better than Barack Obama to turn a new page in American politics so that Democrats, independents and Republicans alike can look to the leadership that unites to find common ground?' he said. The reference to a 'new page' was most obviously a criticism of the administration of President George W. Bush, who had vanquished Kerry in 2004. Also on the list: Senator Ted Kennedy speaks after a tribute to him at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado . John Kerry, pictured here arriving in Paris yesterday, is now U.S. Secretary of State, having replaced Hillary Clinton . But it was also seen by some as a jab at the Clintons, whom the Obama campaign was trying to paint as synonymous with politics as usual, The Hill reported. Leahy endorsed Obama approximately one week later. Rockefeller would do so at the end of February and Casey at the end of March. Casey's endorsement came amid a full-court press from the Clinton campaign to win the April primary in his state of Pennsylvania by a convincing margin. They accomplished that goal, but it was not enough to halt Obama's momentum on his way to the nomination. HRC will be published by Crown on February 11. It will tell the inside story of Clinton's relationship with Obama, and of how she recovered after the bruising 2008 campaign and restored her political standing.","Detailed list also included Democratic Party heavyweight Ted Kennedy .

The driver of the train that derailed in New York last month, killing four people and injuring dozens more, had consistently been working a demanding overtime schedule in the years leading up to last month’s fatal derailment, payroll records have shown. William Rockefeller, who has been suspended without pay since the crash, worked an average of 762 overtime hours per year in 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to MTA data. On the basis that Metro-North drivers work a typical 40-hour work week of five eight-hour shifts, that's the equivalent of working a sixth day every week for three years straight. William Rockefeller, who has been suspended without pay since the Metro-North crash in early December, has worked an average of six days a week for the past three years . The reliance on overtime scheduling along the Metro-North line has been described as ‘shocking’ by U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel,  a Democrat who represents the Bronx district where the train derailed. As well as requesting payroll records for Rockefeller, NBC New York also requested information for 20 of the highest paid Metro-North engineers in 2010, 2011 and 2012. They found that one train operator worked 1,183 overtime hours in 2011, which works out to an average of 23 hours of overtime every week. Another top overtime earner made a staggering $71,000 in overtime on top of $98,000 in regular pay in 2011. That works out to 1,222 overtime hours in a single year or the equivalent of working eight days a week. Horrifying: The high-speed train derailment that killed four people has led the MTA to adopt several new safety measures . The records show that Rockefeller earned almost $45,000 in overtime pay in 2012, almost double the $23,000 average for Metro-North engineers that year. Union rules allow the most senior Metro-North train operators to have first claim on overtime hours, but this can lead to a handful of veteran engineers working extreme loads of overtime, while others get relatively few extra shifts. Engel has said that he will ask the federal government to make recommendations on reforming overtime rules for train operators. ‘It may be that people will have to be hired, because obviously if there are shifts people are working - all kinds of hours, day-in, day-out, month-in, month-out, year-in, year-out – it’s not good for anybody,’ he said. An MTA spokesman stressed to NBC that Metro-North fully complies with hours of service rules enforced by the Federal Railroad Administration. Union rules allow the most senior Metro-North train operators to have first claim on overtime hours, but this can lead to a handful of veteran engineers working extreme loads of overtime . Rockefeller claims he fell into 'a hypnosis-like daze' when his train ran off the rails along a curve on the outskirts of New York while travelling at 82 mph at the beginning of December. His lawyer Jeffrey Chartier said the engineer experienced a nod or ‘a daze,’ almost like road fatigue or the phenomenon sometimes called highway hypnosis. He couldn't say how long it lasted. What Rockefeller remembers is ‘operating the train, coming to a section where the track was still clear - then, all of a sudden, feeling something was wrong and hitting the brakes,’ Chartier said. ‘... He felt something was not right, and he hit the brakes.’ He called Rockefeller ‘a guy with a stellar record who, I believe, did nothing wrong.’ ‘You've got a good guy and an accident,’ he said. ‘... A terrible accident is what it is.’ Rockefeller ‘basically nodded,’ said Anthony Bottalico, leader of the rail employees union, relating what he said the engineer told him. ‘He had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car,’ Bottalico said. ‘That is, you sometimes have a momentary nod or whatever that might be.’ In the wake of the crash, investigators quickly determined that the deadly train derailment was not caused by any technical problems with the train itself as the driver had originally claimed.","Pay records show William Rockefeller had worked the equivalent of six days a week for three years .

Spozhmai, the 10-year-old Afghan girl sent to blow up a police checkpoint last week, has said her father and brother forced her into it . A ten-year-old girl sent to blow up a police checkpoint in Afghanistan wearing a suicide vest has said how her father and brother forced her to do it. The girl, named as Spozhmai, has said her relatives beat her before telling her to put on the vest. She says she was treated like a slave at home, and forbidden from learning how to read and write. Spozmai, who is thought to be the sister of a prominent Taliban commander, says her father has ordered her to return home but that she has refused. Speaking to the BBC, she added: 'I said: ""No, I will kill myself rather than go with you.""' 'The same thing will happen again. They have told me before: ""If you don't do it this time, we will make you do it again."" 'I did all the things at home, I cooked, I cleaned the whole house, and they would treat me badly as if I was a slave.' The case first came to light last week when the Afghan Interior Ministry said police had apprehended the young girl who had intended to carry out a suicide attack against Afghan border police in southern Helmand province. She was said to be in a state of shock and confusion at the time. In a statement, the Interior Ministry said the girl claimed her brother, a local Taliban commander, had sent her on the mission. According to spokesman Sediq Sediqi, one of the Afghan soldiers spotted the girl wearing a suicide jacket. But she was arrested before she could carry the attack as she struggled to operate the detonator. The girl has now been transferred to the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah.

The oldest living teacher in America has just turned 100 - and shows no signs of slowing down. Home economics teacher Agnes Zhelesnik, affectionately known as 'granny' to her pupils, celebrated reaching her centenary on Sunday. Colleagues threw a special birthday party for the much-loved teacher and invited more than 100 present and former pupils. Celbration: Surrounded by colleagues and pupils, Agnes Zhelesnik looks at a birthday cake specially made to celebrate the oldest teacher in America turning 100 . Happy birthday: More than 100 present and former pupils joined Agnes Zhelesnik to celebrate her turning 100 years old . The centenarian, who still works five . days a week at Sundance grade school in North Plainfield, New Jersey, . vowed that as long as her body holds up she'll carry on imparting . knowledge to her pupils. And judging by the reaction of students, age has not prevented her from creating thoroughly captivating and entertaining lessons. They created a special birthday card for their beloved 'granny' with touching messages of thanks for her dedication. One of her pupils told CBS news: 'I just think she loves the children. She puts the love into her . cooking. No, you cant taste love, but you can feel love.' Another . added that she was still sprightly and said he was amazed she still had the energy to come into the class room. Fulfilment: Agnes Zhelesnik has been teaching since she was 81 year of age and wants to carry on as long as her health holds up . Adored: Pupils helped create this birthday card to celebrate Agnes Zhelesnik's 100th birthday . Emotional: A tearful Agnes Zhelesnik dabs her eyes as she is overcome by the warm messages from pupils . Agnes started working at the school at the age . of 81, after she had finished bringing up her own children and grandchildren. Today, she's so devoted to these kids, she hasn't even called in . sick since she was 98. She told CBS news: 'My husband didn’t approve of working -- he wanted me to watch the children.' 'And all the children love her, because she's so nice, so compassionate,' says another. 'She perseveres a lot.' 'What else is there in life?' Agnes asks. 'Children make the whole world.' From 1920 to 1929, when Agnes Zhelesnik would have been at school, mass education in America was increasingly important. In that period compulsory schooling until 16 became the norm. Child labour was being reduced meaning more children stayed in school, but in 1920 only 17 per cent of those who stayed actually graduated. School textbooks were censored however. John Scopes, a high school biology teacher, was charged with illegally teaching the theory of evolution at the Scopes trial of 1925. Mrs Zhelesnik was forced to leave school at 16 in 1930 and take a job soldering at the American Can Company. She wasn't alone and the Great Depression of that decade saw many changes in education. Only half of those between the ages of fourteen and sixteen were attending school in the period. Teachers were losing their jobs and the school year was cut back.","Home economics teacher Agnes Zhelesnik turned 100 on Sunday .

Strong storms have been wreaking havoc as they barreled across North Carolina this weekend – and one scared witness caught some of the mayhem on camera. Ed Braz, of Brier Creek, took video of an entire section of a condominium complex collapsing during the violent storm. He was talking about how scary the storm was while taking the video in the town near Raleigh when the building came down into his back yard. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Still standing: The condos just before being blown over . The storms have spawned tornadoes, ripped trees out of the ground and knocked out power to nearly 50,000 people, according to WTVD. A man and a woman, were killed Saturday in separate car accidents, and a handful of others were injured as winds gusted up to 86 miles per hour, according to both WTVD and CNN. Those gusts topped wind speeds during two recent hurricanes, CNN noted. The male, 33, ran off the road in a torrential downpour. The woman, 50, died from injuries sustained when she was hit by a falling tree limb. Timber!: A loud roar came from outside and the building started blowing over . Both buildings: Once the building at center went down, it also took out the building on the screen's far right . No injuries: Thankfully no one was inside the collapsing buildings, and no one outside them was injured . Demolished: The buildings were reduced to a pile of splinters in less than a minute . The most dramatic scene came courtesy of Mr Braz. He sounded nervous while taking the video and talked about the dangerous storm. Then, as if on cue, a deafening sound came from in front of him and a whole section of the condo was literally blown down. It was still under construction, and no injuries resulted from the collapse, but the building was left in a giant heap in Mr Brier’s backyard. The collapse took out four units, according to WTVD. Winds then howled through the opening left by the collapsed building and brought an eerie fog and mist into Mr Braz's backyard that cut visibility down to almost zero. The powerful storm roared through the area on the back of a cold front that is bringing round two of the Polar Vortex to the northern half of the US.","A total of four condominium units were taken out in the collapse .

A kind-hearted couple splashed out over £9,000 to fly 17 rescue animals from New Mexico to their home in Scotland to save them from being put down. Rebecca Knowles and her husband Vishnu brought the 15 dogs and two cats almost 5,000 miles across the Atlantic to their country home in the hills above Loch Ness. Mrs Knowles said she just could not bear to abandon the animals after discovering them at farm where they were kept in cages and bred continuously. Compassion: Rebecca Knowles with three of the dogs she rescued in New Mexico and flew back to her home in Scotland . The mental health counsellor said: 'I had a small rescue sanctuary which was mostly retired breeding dogs I rescued from a puppy mill that was closing down. 'The dogs were going to be euthanised so I rescued them. 'I had 40 dogs at one point, half were from the puppy mill and the rest were strays I’d rescued and pets my clients couldn’t look after any more.' Last year Mrs Knowles, who is originally from Aberdeen, decided to move back home to Scotland with her husband after 17 years in America and tried to rehome the animals. Some were successful and found new homes but many were returned to the sanctuary and the couple decided they had no choice but to take them. Route: The animals were flown almost 5,000 miles from Chaparral in New Mexico to West Abercalder in Scotland . The dogs, which include poodles and a boxer as well as mixed breeds, and the two cats had a 24-hour journey including a flight from the animal sanctuary at Chaparral to their new home at West Abercalder. Mrs Knowles, 51, said: 'It’s cost us around $15,000 - about £9,000. In my view animal lives are just as important as human lives. 'People were saying: ‘why don’t you put them in a shelter?’ but I had rescued them from a horrible situation where they had been in cages all their lives. It was worth the expense to keep them with me. 'They are doing really well and love the space we have here.'

'I’d be interested in finding homes for them over here and anybody interested in providing one can get in touch. 'Out there [America] people have a very different view of animals and pet owning. 'It’s pretty much a third world country with stray dogs in the streets. 'I feel British people have a better concept of caring for animals.

A grandmother has been driven out of her own home after vandals smashed up tiles to remove a large part of her roof in the latest of a string of incidents against her property. Joyce Faulkner, 62, said she is now too scared to stay in her Greater Manchester home, which is cold, wet and unlivable due to the vandalism. The damage is just the latest in a string of harassment incidents at the Davenport house which has seen Joyce make 50 reports to the police over the last two years. Grandmother Joyce Faulkner has been forced to stay with friends after being driven out of her home by vandals who removed large tiles from her roof in the early hours of New Year's Day . Ms Faulkner said she can no longer live at her Greater Manchester home because, as well as being scared, the vandalised roof causes rain to pour in . Within the last 24 months, she has reported smashed windows, grass on her lawn being poisoned, animal carcasses being left on her doorstep and her car being damaged. Yet despite her suffering, nobody has been prosecuted in connection with the bizarre occurrences. The latest incident has left the grandmother-of-two staying at friends’ homes fretting over what may happen next. She said: 'I heard banging on the roof and slates crashing down, I just barricaded myself in and called the police - it was terrifying. 'Anyone can get in the house now, I go back to check on the house but only in the day - I’m too scared to go at night, especially now part of the roof is missing. 'I just can’t live there, I feel so scared and can’t eat or sleep. I’m always looking over my shoulder, it has become a way of life. Currently I am moving from one friend’s house to another.' The roof, which was dismantled in the early hours of New Year’s Day, will have to be repaired once Joyce has given details to her insurance company. Ms Faulkner, 62, who has four children and two grandchildren, is currently staying with friends while the roof of her home is repaired and because she claims she is too scared to return on her own . The latest incident comes after Ms Faulkner made 50 calls to police to report vandalism at her home. In the last two years she has reported her car windscreen being smashed, above, animal carcasses being left on her doorstep and the grass on her front lawn being poisoned . As well as the police, the mother-of-four has also reported the incidents to the council’s anti-social behaviour team and had CCTV installed at her property. But she says neither the police or council are taking the harassment, which started with an egg being thrown at her window in February 2012, seriously enough. However, Sergeant Gareth Davis said Greater Manchester Police was aware of the incidents. He said: 'It is understandably distressing and we naturally have a lot of sympathy. The grandmother-of-two has previously reported to police that the grass on the front lawn of her Davenport home was poisoned. She said she is now too scared to return to her home and is fretting over what may happen next . 'Officers have been working to bring about a peaceful conclusion and have followed up on all reported incidents to find out who is responsible. 'There are numerous factors which contribute to these incidents and officers continue to review all the evidence to take the most appropriate action.' A Stockport Council spokesman said: 'Stockport Council, police and other agencies have worked closely with Ms Faulkner to resolve the issue, progressing different solutions. 'We will continue to do this.'","Joyce Faulkner forced to stay with friends after vandals smashed roof tiles .

Blunder: University College has apologised after accidentally sending out results of its worst-performing students in an email . An Oxford University college has upset its students after accidentally sending out a list of the worst performers to hundreds of their fellow undergraduates. The embarrassing leak revealed the names and grades of students at University College who had the lowest marks in the pre-Christmas exams. Known as ‘collections’, the exams are used to check whether pupils are on track to a good final grade, but do not go towards their degree mark. But almost 50 who achieved a 2:2 grade - a mark below 60 per cent - or worse in the Michaelmas collections had their results sent to fellow students. The information was contained in an Excel document accidentally sent out by Kristiana Dahl, an academic administrator at University College, which counts Stephen Hawking and Bill Clinton among its alumni. It showed the worst-performing students in the college, as well as their percentage mark and their degree subject. Officials have not revealed how many students received the email but it is thought it was sent to hundreds at University College - known as ‘Univ’. Staff quickly asked students to 'please delete the email previously sent out as it contained inaccuracies'. One of the students affected, who did not wish to be identified, told student newspaper The Tab: “I don’t ever want to do collections again. 'I was pretty gutted after my results last term, but didn’t realise I would be publicly humiliated. I can’t even go into college any more. 'I want a full explanation from the college. I would sue but there are apparently no decent lawyers at Univ.' Exam 'humiliation': Students were left dismayed after the worst performers had their results included in an email to fellow undergraduates (file picture) Tam Guobadia, a second-year law student said: 'I personally find it quite funny but I understand why some people might be upset.' Another student said: 'Of course, everyone on the list is just trying to laugh it off. 'But in reality, no one feels comfortable with having something so personal shared with the entire college. 'It’s hard not to feel everyone’s talking about you.' Abigail Reeves, head of the college's Junior Common Room, apologised to students after a meeting with senior tutor Dr Anne Knowland. She said: 'Dr Knowland has assured me that the document was sent accidentally and that the disclosure of results was not intentional. 'The member of staff responsible is apparently mortified.

A murder mystery could be solved after eight decades as scientists use modern DNA techniques to identify the unknown victim of a gruesome 1930 killing. Psychotic killer Alfred Rouse smashed an unidentified man over the head with a mallet, then placed his body in a Morris Minor and set the car on fire in a botched attempt to fake his own death. He never revealed the identity of the victim - but relatives of William Briggs, a man who disappeared around the same time, are convinced that their ancestor was the murdered man. Now a group of forensic scientists are examining a sample of the victim's DNA in an attempt to establish the details of the case 83 years on. Killer: Alfred Rouse murdered an unidentified man after suffering a head wound during the First World War . Crime scene: Rouse's Morris Minor was found burning near Northampton with a man trapped inside . Rouse made legal history by being convicted of murder even though no one knew who the victim was. He had suffered a head wound during the First World War, causing a personality disorder which made him 'a promiscuous rake with an enormous sexual appetite'. The 36-year-old had fathered at least two illegitimate children during his post-war career as a travelling salesman, and had been hit by enormous debts which he apparently wanted to escape by faking his death. On November 6 1930, Rouse battered a man . over the head near Northampton, then put him in his own Morris Minor, . surrounded the body with his belongings and set the vehicle on fire. Buried: Campaigners believe that the victim, buried in this grave, could have been missing man William Briggs and are conducting DNA tests on his remains . He tried to escape from the scene, but two young men who were running to investigate the blaze bumped in to him nearby. Rouse fled to Cardiff but was tracked down by police who had used the car's number plate to link it to him. He was arrested, put on trial and . hanged for murder - but he would not reveal the name of the man he had . killed and took the secret to his grave. The victim was buried in the grave of an 'unknown man' in a Northamptonshire cemetery, and has lain there ever since. Shortly . before the killing, Mr Briggs had left his London home for a doctor's . appointment, but disappeared and was never seen again. His . family grew to believe that he had somehow crossed paths with Rouse, . and in 1957 they asked Northamptonshire Police to re-open the murder . investigation. However, the case was not classified as a cold case because the perpetrator had been brought to justice. A few years ago, Mr Briggs's great-niece Samantha Hall was told of the family's campaign while researching her background. 'My . nan showed me newspaper clippings together with letters that her aunt . had written in 1957, in an attempt to re-open the murder case,' she . said. 'My family were convinced that William was Rouse's victim. 'It also seemed plausible that, with the advent of new technologies, we may still have a chance of positive identification.' Mystery: Rouse, who was apparently trying to fake his own death, never revealed the identity of his victim . Mitochondrial DNA, or 'mtDNA', could prove the key to identifying the remains of Alfred Rouse's murder victim. The genetic material is found in the mitochondria of cells rather than their nuclei, and is transmitted in the womb rather than during the reproductive process - meaning that everyone's mtDNA is an exact copy of their mother's. People have much more mtDNA than nuclear DNA, meaning that it is often used to identify long-dead corpses because it is more likely to remain present in the body decades later. Another advantage of mtDNA is that because it is passed solely from mother to child, rather than being mingled with genetic material from fathers, it remains stable down the generations, providing a more secure link between ancestors and descendants. In the past, it has been used to identify the remains of outlaw Jesse James and Russian tsar Nicholas II, by comparing their mtDNA to that of distant relatives. She was put in touch with a team of forensic scientists at the University of Leicester, which famously identified a medieval skeleton found in a car park as the body of King Richard III. Researchers were able to obtain a tissue sample taken from the victim during a post-mortem examination carried out in a pub near the murder scene. The sample and the victim's jawbone were archived in the London Hospital Medical College, now part of Queen Mary University. 'Fortunately, the scientists obtained a full single male mtDNA profile from the slide to compare to the family,' said a spokesman for the team. 'It's been very interesting and rewarding working on such a famous local murder case. 'It was a unique investigation to be involved in, as the perpetrator had been identified long ago and brought to justice while the victim's identity remained unknown. 'The scientific and criminological expertise at the University of Leicester and Northumbria University, working together with the police, could provide answers to this family after 83 years.' Scientists are due to reveal their results on BBC1's The One Show at a future date. A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said that its cold case review team would discuss the findings, and could exhume the victim's remains for further DNA testing.","Alfred Rouse killed unidentified man near Northampton in botched attempt to fake his own death .

From snakes to lizards, geckos and even stick insects, the animal-loving British aren't afraid to take unlikely pets to heart. But the slimy jellyfish has confounded all attempts to domesticate it - until now that is. So delicate are the wobbly fish, . attempts to keep them as pets have ended in death for the jellyfish . thanks to the filters used in tanks for tropical fish. Expensive: Jellyfish Art's specially designed jellyfish aquarium comes complete with wibbly residents . But now a US company has managed to design a filter-free tank, which comes complete with a family of moon jellyfish to enjoy. The world’s first domestic aquarium designed specifically for the translucent medusas is available from Jellyfish Art and comes fitted with LED lights to brighten up the tank and its colourless occupants. The seven-gallon tank is circular in shape and uses a unique pump system to circulate water in a controlled swirl, nudging the fish gently away from the sides of the tank and clear of the dangerous filter valves. The specially designed jelly keeping kit costs $382 (£238) plus VAT and shipping charges, and includes the tank, a small family of moon jellyfish and a three ounce bag of specialist jellyfish food. Although the website is based in America, it will FedEx the jelly kit to the UK, although it won't ship  live jellyfish abroad. Peaceful: Watching moon jellyfish drifting about their business is said to have a soothing effect . Jellyfish Art sells the tanks and the moon jellyfish to go in them, as well as cleaner snails and hermit crabs . British would-be jellyfish owners can pick up theirs from Aquarium Architecture, which will happily source moon jellyfish (£65 each plus £95 overnight delivery charges) and other marine life for British clients. The British company is also licensed to sell the tanks, although they cost a lot more than the US equivalent - £475 for a standard tank containing a single jellyfish. So are the translucent fish good pets? According to Jellyfish Art, they are a soothing, low maintenance alternative to tropical fish. A spokesman for the website said: 'I would have to have to say the fact that they are kind of 'exotic' is probably a draw for a lot of people. 'Being one of the first to own a new thing. Another thing I hear people mention is that they want them to be a form of relaxation and just sit around and watch the jellies float around.' The website also sells special jellyfish feeding kits, as the marine beasts can't survive on regular fish food. 'Jellyfish Art provides a Frozen Jellyfish Food specifically formulated for jellyfish made from plankton high in HUFAs (Highly Unsaturated Fatty Acids), which are essential for proper nutrition,' adds the spokesman. 'We strongly suggest only feeding jellyfish with our recommended food. Other fish foods that claim to be suitable for jellyfish are often low quality.' But whether or not you feed your jellies the HUFA mix recommended by Jellyfish Art, your time as the proud owner of your very own jellyfish could be brief, as moon jellyfish are notoriously short-lived. The would-be pets survive less than two months in the wild, although they do replace themselves quickly - wild adult moon jellyfish produce larvae every day. If yours prove less fertile, Jellyfish Art or Aquarium Architecture will send replacements but they don't come cheap: a small jellyfish costs $39 (£24) while a large one is $55 (£34) plus postage and packaging. But be careful if you decide to replace your lost jelly with one of the site's $5 hermit crabs. Unlike the short-lived jellyfish, hermit crabs can live up to 32 years in captivity so you could find yourself with a pet for life! 1. It doesn't sting: Unlike poisonous relatives such as the Portuguese Man O'War, the moon jellyfish doesn't sting. That ought to make cleaning the tank a bit easier! 2. It only lives for six months in the wild: Although wild moon jellyfish live for less than six months in the wild, they can live for several years in an aquarium if professionally cared for. 3. Although it's transparent and tiny, it has four names: Along with its Latin name, Aurelia aurita, moon Jellyfish are also known as 'common jellyfish' and 'saucer jellyfish'. 4. Moon Jellyfish are found EVERYWHERE: The jellyfish are found in seas all over the world, including those that lap the British shore. If you don't fancy splashing out $39 on an American jelly, you could always head to Cornwall, where moon jellyfish are regularly seen floating just off beaches and in harbours. 5. It doesn't have the ability to poo: The moon jellyfish is one of the world's most basic animals and has very few body parts. Although it has tentacles and four gonads, which it uses to digest its food and reproduce, it has no circulatory, respiratory or excretory systems.","Jellyfish can't be kept in regular aquariums because they get sucked into the filter and shredded by the fan .

A Scottish artist has produced an astonishingly lifelike collection of portraits using nothing more than charcoal and paper. Douglas McDougall from Glasgow created the drawings of good friends and people who he would simply like to know better as a 'way of encapsulating and understanding the ongoing museum of human experience.' Mr McDougall uses charcoal and scalpel blades to achieve the ultra realistic finish of his drawings . The collection features good friends of the artist and people he would like to get to know better . Mr McDougall learned how to draw as a child when suffering a blood disease which landed him in hospital . After sketching the portraits with charcoal, the artist textures the paper with scalpel blades, sharp cut erasers and sandpaper. The end result is a hyper-realistic image which can easily be mistaken for a black and white photograph. Mr McDougall's depiction of weathered skin and grey hair is particularly lifelike. 'Creative surrogacy': Mr McDougall describes his unusual introduction to art as a child drawing tubes and wires from his hospital bed . 'By carving into the paper one can feel the power, and the magic and the luck. The face is a mirror of the soul, for better or worse. 'Portraiture is my way of encapsulating and understanding the ongoing museum of human experience, to show who we really are. Mr McDougall said he's able to feel a certain kind of magic by using charcoal and blades to cut into paper . Mr McDougall talks about an 'intimacy deficit' on his blog after describing the 'removal of my natural parents' Mr McDougall talks about an 'intimacy deficit' on his blog after describing the 'removal of my natural parents' Each portrait is a study into the personality of the subject which ultimately links to the timeline of mortality, says Mr McDougall . Mr McDougall, 50, learned to draw as a child after being forced in and out of hospital with a blood disease. He used the countless hours spent in hospital wards to sketch drawings of his surroundings. Born in Blackpool, Mr McDougall moved to Glasgow with his father at the age of five after his parents decided to separate. His mother suffered 'acute' post natal depression shortly after giving birth. The artist said: 'I was never to bond with her.' Soon after moving to Glasgow his father's business spread nationwide, and so he was passed on to close relatives to be looked after as his father had to travel the country for work. Waking the gods: McDougall said at times he feels as though he is waking the gods in his old fashioned style of art which resembles that of cavemen at times . It has been suggested that Mr McDougall's troubled childhood has inspired some of the darker elements to his work . 'i was never to have a bond with her':Mr McDougall's mother suffered acute post natal depression shortly after giving birth to him . According to Mr McDougall, each portrait is a path through the personality of the chosen study that 'links to the timeline of mortality itself.' 'Each piece is like an oracle of thought, a kaleidoscopic journey into a past, present and future. I feel it's honouring the tradition of drawing, bringing those early cave paintings or hieroglyphics into a modern synthesis. 'At times this work almost makes me feel like I'm personally waking the gods, and they really do have to virtually be brought into a breathing reality.' The artist's depiction of grey hair and aging skin seen throughout the collection of portraits is particularly striking . 'This is why I tend to push for a hyper-real result, and by using certain tools like Stanley and scalpel blades for sculpting/texture and highlighting, it helps create a kind of 'trompe l'oeil' illusion of form. 'For me the medium of Charcoal holds a double headed dynamic. 'It packs an old world feel to it that allows me to plug in and play with the terms of its historical theatrical elements, or ghosts of the past. 'It also provides a stunning foundation and plenty of room for the contemporary immediacy of it all. 'When I'm in the zone it's like having a black key to my own time machine.

They would appear to be the answer to many womenâ€™s prayers - a pair of stylish jeans that can smooth away cellulite. Brazilian designer Alexandre Herchcovitch claims to have developed the worldâ€™s first jeans that combat the dreaded 'orange peel'. His so-called 'beauty denim' harnesses body heat and turns it into infrared rays that are relayed back to the skin and stimulates the areas most at risk from cellulite. The effect, he claims, is to increase microcirculatory blood flow and cellular metabolism and so prevent cellulite from building up. Unveiling the anti-cellulite jeans at a fashion show in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Mr Herchcovitch claims five years of research into the product has proved it is effective. However, medical experts are skeptical, saying there is no miracle cure for cellulite which can be caused by poor diet, bad circulation and slow metabolism. Cellulite is thought to affect around 90 . per cent of women over the age of 30 in Britain - with a range of . lotions, creams and even surgery aimed at combating it. Herchcovitchâ€™s jeans use a manmade . fibre called Emana yarn that was developed in Brazil and has already . been used in sports clothing and lingerie. Common: Cellulite - which often results in 'orange peel' skin - is thought to affect around 90 per cent of women over the age of 30 in Britain. It can be caused by poor diet, bad circulation and slow metabolism . The synthetic Emana yarn is said to absorb the electromagnetic waves emitted by the human body, known as Far Infrared Rays. When these invisible rays come into contact with the body they provide stimulation of tissue - therefore preventing a buildup of cellulite. Leggings made from Emana yarn can be bought in the UK from an online retailer and are sold at Harrods. Herchcovitch has not said when his designer jeans will be on sale or how much they will cost. Exhibit: Mr Herchcovitch, right, appears on the catwalk after presenting his 2014 winter collection last week . But he is not the first fashion label to try and market a pair of jeans that can eradicate cellulite. In . 2004, the Miss Sixty clothing company introduced a range of jeans, . trousers and skirts which it claimed could smooth away cellulite.

He's back: Former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers has moved back into his grace-and-favour vicarage . There was rising anger last night after it emerged disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers has moved back into his grace-and-favour manse. The 63-year-old Methodist minister, whose lifestyle sent shockwaves through both the church and the bank, was spotted back at the £300,000 house owned by the church last week. The cleric, who allegedly took cocaine and crystal meth and paid out hundreds of pounds for sex with rent boys, is understood to be living rent-free in the four-bedroom house in Bradford, with the blessing of Methodist church leaders. Yesterday the revelation caused fury among both residents and parishioners. Pauline Edwards, 61, a Methodist churchgoer, said: ‘I can’t really believe he’s been allowed back in. It’s an outrage really. He should have the decency to quit and not show his face again. ‘He hasn’t denied the allegations he used drugs and went with rent boys so he should go.’ A spokesman for Families Against Crime, which works with drug addicts, said: ‘Many people working in the sex trade are addicted to drugs and do so to fund their addictions. ‘It is totally wrong that a church minister accused of funding the drug addictions of male prostitutes is living in a church house. ‘He is taking advantage of their vulnerability for his own purposes. It’s a disgrace.’ Another former parishioner said he was disillusioned with the church leadership over the scandal. He said: ‘I know they’re waiting until the conclusion of the police investigation but I don’t think he should be paid or live in the manse while he is under investigation. It sends out the wrong message. ‘I’m totally disillusioned with the way it has been handled and there are quite a few worshippers who have stopped going to church or go elsewhere in south Bradford.’ Yesterday it was revealed that Flowers, who faces investigations by both the police and City regulators, has not lost his appetite for an unorthodox lifestyle. Allegations: The Methodist minister, pictured right in December, allegedly took cocaine and crystal meth and paid for sex with rent boys. He is understood to be living rent-free in the four-bedroom house in Bradford . Crystal meth shame: How The Mail On Sunday broke the original story in November last year . Although he promised to seek professional help, he is allegedly still using the horse tranquiliser drug ketamine and consorting with male prostitutes. Last Wednesday, he asked a rent boy to visit and promised in a taped telephone call: ‘I will have K [ketamine] but that’s all. You get what you want.’ According to an investigation by The Mail on Sunday, the £400-a-night escort, who is 40 years his junior, told Flowers he wanted to bring a friend along. Under investigation: The 63-year-old cleric allegedly still uses the horse tranquiliser drug ketamine . The minister replied: ‘How much have I . got to pay for that, for God’s sake? I don’t want the escort to be off . his trolley like before.’ Informed the cost would be the ‘same as last time’, Flowers admitted he couldn’t remember what he paid before. The fresh revelations will pour yet more scandal on the Co-op Bank, which has been lambasted over its choice of chairman. Action: In November, Chancellor George Osborne announced an independent inquiry into the whole Co-op Bank affair . It came close to collapse after running up £700million in losses and being forced to fill a £1.5billion black hole in its funding. As bank chairman and deputy chairman of the Co-operative Group, Flowers oversaw the bank’s activities throughout the lead-up to the crisis. Last week the financial industry’s two main watchdogs – the Prudential Regulatory Authority, an arm of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority – announced they would hold separate investigations into whether there was any failure or wrongdoing at Co-op Bank. Flowers is expected to be called to testify. In November, Chancellor George Osborne announced an independent inquiry into the whole Co-op Bank affair, but that will have to wait until the two City watchdogs have completed their investigations, which are set to take several months. Flowers’ lifestyle was exposed last November when he was filmed allegedly handing over £300 for the Class A drug, crystal meth, and the latest revelations are set to disappoint his Methodist church employers. A spokesman for the church said: ‘He is still an office holder in the church and we will investigate thoroughly once any criminal processes have finished.’ Flowers, a minister for 40 years, is due to be reinterviewed by detectives this week over the drug allegations.","Paul Flowers, 63, spotted back at £300,000 house in Bradford last week .

Tragic: Catherine Moston was 37 weeks' pregnant when she took ill at the school where she worked in Rochdale, Manchester . A heavily pregnant teacher collapsed in class and died in hospital with her unborn baby. Catherine Moston, 35, was three weeks from giving birth when she started feeling weak at work and went home to rest. Her condition continued to deteriorate and she stopped breathing in the ambulance sent to help her. Paramedics resuscitated her but her unborn daughter, Esther Grace, was pronounced dead at the hospital. Doctors then battled to save Mrs Moston’s life but within hours she died after suffering a ruptured placenta and  cardiac arrest. Last night her distraught  husband, Matt, 38, said he and daughter Isla, three, were struggling to get to grips with the tragedy. ‘This happened completely out of the blue,’ he added. ‘We were due to go into hospital to have the baby turned because it was breached but that’s just normal. ‘Everyone just presumed the pain was the baby turning itself or it had already turned and it was early labour. 'The doctors said it’s a very, very rare thing to happen, which is why no one was expecting it. ‘Catherine was looking like a ray of health at the weekend and she was just so excited about the baby. ‘She was a devoted mother and loving wife. She was my rock really. Isla is OK but it’s so hard to tell a child. We’ve told her mummy is with the angels.’ Mrs Moston, who was head of  science at Middleton Technology College, near Rochdale, was 37 weeks pregnant. She fell fatally ill on Wednesday – 24 hours before the appointment to try to turn her baby in the womb. Her father Peter Lee, 70, who summoned the ambulance on the advice of the midwife, said: ‘She was passionate about teaching, that’s what she wanted to do and she never looked back. She loved her job. She put so much into it. Family: Mrs Moston, pictured with her husband Matt and daughter Isla, 3, is believed to have suffered a ruptured placenta. She had previously been warned that her unborn baby, Esther Grace, was in the breech position . Ambitious: She was head of science at the 1,030-pupil Middleton Technology School (pictured), where she had worked for 10 years. She is also believed to have been in line to become deputy head teacher . Devoted mother: Her widower Matt said she was an 'amazing mum and wife' who 'organised our whole lives' Successful: Mrs Moston was said to have 'put pupils first and herself second' ‘Her lessons were always rated . outstanding in Ofsted inspections. She was very bubbly, loving and . popular. She was always well liked, she was just that sort of person and . it came out in her teaching.’ Mrs Moston, who had a sister and two brothers, met her husband at a wedding in October 2003 and they married in 2008. She . became head of science at 1,030-pupil Middleton Technology College and . was seconded to other schools to improve their teaching. In . a letter to parents, headmistress Allison Crompton wrote: ‘Cath was a . brilliant teacher and colleague who was extremely well regarded . professionally and well liked by everyone, and will be greatly and sadly . missed.’ Tests are being . carried out to establish the cause of death but it is believed Mrs .

Older shoppers were less good at spotting bargains in a test done by Bangor University academics . We might expect hearing or eyesight to fade with age – but here’s one change you might not have bargained on. The older we get, the worse we are at spotting the best supermarket deals, new research has revealed. Despite years of experience, it is younger shoppers who are more attuned to identifying a good discount. Scientists at Bangor University, North . Wales, carried out MRI brain scans on around 30 volunteers who were . shown a series of offers and told to save as much money as possible. They . had to choose what quantity to purchase before moving on to the next . item – but some of the examples were bad deals costing more than the . original price. Imaging techniques highlighted hotspots of brain activity revealing ‘emotional circuitry’ was used to make some decisions. Researcher . Dr Paul Mullins said younger shoppers definitely have an advantage, . adding: ‘It is unusual because one would think that older people would . be better drilled at evaluating what was and what was not a bargain. 'This is very interesting though we don’t . know exactly why it happens and would like to do some more research to . find out why this may be the case.’ The research also shows that women shoppers are no better than men when it comes to being able to identify a cut-price deal. Instead men are level pegging with women when it comes to saving cash on the weekly shop. Dr Emily Cross, one of the lead . researchers, said: ‘The advantage of using MRI to image the brain while . actively making shopping decisions is that it enables us to see how the . whole brain responds, including the ‘deeper’ areas of the brain, such as . those associated with emotion and desire. Men and women were equally as good at spotting the best cut-price deal, the research found . ‘This lets us understand more about what makes an offer appealing: in some cases the choice appears to be more rational, and in other cases we can see emotional circuitry getting involved in the decision-making process.’ The ‘supermarket shoppers’ were taking part in a major cutting-edge project by UK-based SBXL, one of Europe’s leading shopping behaviour specialists. The results of the study will be passed on to product and food manufacturers who provide goods for supermarkets and stores. Phillip Adcock, managing director of SBXL, said: ‘We know from previous research that the brain behaves illogically when faced with the sort of information overload that shoppers are faced with in a typical supermarket. ‘Now we have a reliable and scientific way of validating this research and understanding exactly what is happening in the brain during the weekly shop.’","Bangor University scientists carried out MRI brain scans on 30 volunteers .

Tragedy: Emma Hopwood, who friends and family said drank every day, died after falling down the stairs at her home in Stockport, Greater Manchester . An alcoholic mother-of-three died when she fell down the stairs at her home while drinking alone. Emma Hopwood, 30, was found by her estranged partner. The former barmaid, who friends said was once a ‘yummy mummy’, started binge drinking as an 18-year-old, an inquest heard. Although she had three children, her drunken nights out escalated into all-day drinking bouts fuelled by huge amounts of cheap cider. Her best friend Debra Walters told the hearing: ‘She was someone who drank from when she woke up to when she went to sleep.’ Last June she fell backwards down stairs at her home and suffered a fatal double fracture of the skull. Tests showed she was more than three times the drink-drive limit and police found many empty cider cans and drink crates at the house. Last night her mother Janet Maher, 48, warned of the dangers of binge drinking – and said parents should take action. She said: ‘Parents of young people who drink too much need look for the signs and give them a lot of love and affection. 'The way my daughter died could happen to anyone young lady who drinks too much alcohol for her own good. 'She started drinking when she was a teenager when she used to go out to the pub with her friends like most girls her age. But despite liking a drink she used to get up and go to work - she wasn't drunk every day. Worried: Emma's mother Janet Maher today warned of the dangers of drinking after the inquest into her own daughter's death . 'But it escalated during her relationship . with the father of her children and she would drink to blot it out. In . later life she would phone me sometimes and I could tell she had had a . drink because she was slurring her words. 'She always drank cheap cider and she . used to hide empty cans. She would hide them in cupboards, in the . laundry basket, in the toilet cistern, under the bed, in bags, in . handbags. 'She used to go . upstairs quite a lot and that was a sign that she was drinking. Later I . would find empty cans in the bedrooms. Parents should encourage their . children to get professional help. You have to keep on top of it. Troubled:  The 30-year-old mother-of-three had struggled to cope with her alcohol problem since she was 18, her inquest heard . 'We . tried to help her as much as we could but sometimes we couldn't get . through to her but other people, like counsellors, could get through to . her. 'I had to hide all the drink in the house. Towards the end I don't know how many cans of cider she was drinking. 'She . was very good at putting a happy face on but I did worry about her. But . then my worst nightmare happened. If I could, I would change with her . in a heartbeat.' Much-loved: Emma's family and friends are bereft at her death, and said that her drink problem tore her life apart . This . week, experts said the number of women aged 34 and under dying from . alcohol-related conditions, such as liver disease, has more than doubled . since the 1980s. Such deaths are now falling in young men – but rising among young women. The inquest heard Miss Hopwood, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, didn’t drink during pregnancy. But she split with her children’s father Barry Shepherd after drunken and violent rows. In . his statement to the inquest, in Sale, Mr Shepherd said: ‘She was lying . at the bottom of the stairs with her feet going up the stairs. 'She had . blood on her nose.’ He . added: ‘When I first saw her I was ready to say: “Get off the floor, you . silly devil.” 'She looked like she had just sprawled out at the bottom . of the stairs.’ A postmortem examination confirmed that Miss Hopwood had two fractures to her skull and had died as a result of a injury, where the brain moves to opposite side of the skull that was impacted. Dr . Naomi Carter said Miss Hopwood would have been unsteady on her feet with a blood alcohol level of 259mg per 100ml.

Coroner Dr James Adeley condemned the decision to use a mechanical thrombectomy to remove the clot and said the high-risk procedure should have been avoided. His family plan to sue the hospital trust and have reported the case to police. It is also likely to be referred to the General Medical Council. Mrs Galea, 47, said: ‘The devastation this has caused our family cannot be put into words. Quite simply, my husband’s life was taken from him.’ Mr Galea, who ran his own business working with BMW dealerships, had previously had surgery to remove a benign pituitary tumour. The procedure on 47-year-old Mr Galea was carried out at the Royal Preston Hospital (pictured) On August 14 last year he was admitted to the Royal Preston Hospital with breathlessness, chest pains and low blood pressure following a bout of pneumonia. Mrs Galea said after the case: 'He's been stolen away from us - we've been robbed. Our lives have gone forever' (stock image) Large blood clots were diagnosed early on and he was due to have a CT scan to locate the blockages. But on his way to the scan he was intercepted by a medic who insisted he had a pulmonary embolism and needed to have an emergency procedure immediately. Mrs Galea said: ‘We can’t understand how this could have happened. He had been chatting normally and enjoying eating Haribo sweets before he was wheeled in for his CT scan. ‘This member of staff advised us that if Brian did not have this urgent procedure he could have a heart attack or suffer a stroke. It was the first time in our lives that I had ever seen Brian look terrified. ‘When my children and I were then told that he had died we screamed in utter shock and disbelief. The room in which Brian had the procedure was left with a large pool of blood and we saw this being mopped up.’ Mr and Mrs Galea, who met when they were 13, were married for 28 years. They also had a son, Narico, 25. Dr Adeley was highly critical of the way the medical team bypassed the normal ‘gold standard’ procedure to carry out a CT scan to locate clots. Instead Dr Dare Seriki, a radiologist, moved directly to a mechanical thrombectomy, which was known to carry risks. Dr Adeley said Mr Galea’s death would have been avoided if the procedure had been halted  20 minutes earlier. Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Adeley said Mr Galea had died from respiratory failure caused by the tear in the pulmonary artery. He will now write to the hospital urging the trust to review how it treats emergency blood clots. The family of the 'much-loved husband, father and friend' are now set to take legal action against the hospital after a coroner ruled the death could have been avoided . Diane Rostron of Linder Myers solicitors said the verdict found Dr Seriki had both a mistaken and outdated approach to the CT scan which should have been carried out. ‘On Dr Seriki's failure to abandon the procedure, had he done so the tear in the artery wall would have been avoided and Brian would be here today. She said: ‘Also Brian was not adequately consulted before the thrombectomy was carried out and therefore was not able to consider the risks involved in advance. ‘The coroner concluded it was the rupture of the pulmonary artery that quite clearly caused the death and cessation of the procedure would have avoided the tear in the right wall of the pulmonary artery and Brian's death.’","Brian Galea went to the Royal Preston Hospital with low blood pressure .

The BBC handed one of its top executives a £200,000 golden goodbye – then rehired him two years later. Former Radio 1 boss Matthew Bannister – once nicknamed ‘the fat controller’ by DJ Chris Evans – is still on the corporation’s payroll more than a decade after he pocketed the huge severance sum. Details of his extraordinary payoff can be revealed by the Daily Mail as it emerged the BBC re-employed 233 staff it made redundant in the past decade, including another executive given £365,000 as he left. Row: Matthew Bannister, right, fell out spectacularly with Chris Evans, left, over the DJ's working hours . It heaps further pressure on the broadcaster’s top brass to explain why millions of pounds of the licence fee has been handed to departing staff, including £25million to 150 senior employees. Tory MP Stephen Barclay, who sits on the Commons public accounts committee, said the latest revelations ‘drive a coach and horses’ through the BBC’s claim that payoffs helped reduce the overall salary bill by encouraging staff to leave. High salary: Mr Bannister earned £153,000 as controller of Radio 1, head of production and head of marketing . He said: ‘There has been a revolving door at the BBC. You get paid to leave, then paid to come back again. The whole argument for payoffs has been that it reduces the headcount and salary bill. ‘But it is beginning to look like the senior executives approving payoffs were doing so with the expectation they would themselves benefit from similar deals.’ Mr Bannister is currently employed as a presenter on Radio 4 and the World Service. The corporation has refused to disclose his current salary, the 56-year-old earned £153,000 as controller of Radio 1, head of production and head of marketing. He left in 2000 after narrowly losing to Greg Dyke in the race to become director- general. Figures buried in the following year’s accounts reveal he was handed a £140,060 ‘termination payment’, plus £54,590 towards his pension. When he was in charge of Radio 1, Mr Bannister was most famous for hiring Chris Evans. The pair later fell out spectacularly after he refused to let the DJ work a four-day week, prompting Evans to walk out. As head of production, he was embroiled in another row when it was discovered Vanessa Feltz’s daytime talk show had featured fake guests. But instead of leaving the corporation for good after pocketing his payoff, Mr Bannister returned in 2002 as a late-night presenter on Radio 5 Live. He later recalled: ‘I decided to withdraw from managing things and just get on with being a broadcaster, which was lovely.’ Rehired: Mr Bannister, pictured with Zoe Ball, is now employed as a presenter on Radio 4 and World Service . He has since become a well-known voice on Radio 4, where he hosts the weekly obituary programme Last Word. According to The Sunday Telegraph, the BBC also rehired its former head of religion Michael Wakelin after handing him a £364,000 redundancy payment in March 2009. He was later given a part-time job as a producer on Radio 2. A Freedom of Information request revealed that another nine managers earning £100,000 or more were also re-employed despite receiving severance pay. Tory MP Angie Bray said the revelation was ‘gobsmacking’, adding: ‘You would think if you’re getting a payoff, it would be “goodbye” and “thank you for your contribution”. Not “see you in a year”.’ In June, the National Audit Office revealed the BBC has paid out £369million in severance payments over eight years, including £60million to senior managers. A BBC spokesman said: ‘BBC policy states that former full-time employees who have been made redundant may apply and be re-hired into the BBC after a minimum of 12 months, and three months on a freelance contract basis. ‘Matthew Bannister was made redundant from the role of chief executive BBC Production in 2000 making savings on an executive post. He returned two years later.’ The BBC said Michael Wakelin is employed by an independent production company that makes programmes for Radio 2, rather than directly by the corporation.","Former Radio 1 boss Matthew Bannister is still on corporation's payroll .

It seems that whether you’re an X Factor fan or a Downton devotee is determined not by who you are – but by where you live. Our viewing habits reveal strong regional allegiances, with those in the North-East tuning in to anything hosted by Geordie stars Ant and Dec and those in the North-West preferring Manchester export Coronation Street. Research commissioned exclusively by the Daily Mail has revealed our favourite television programmes of the past year, broken down for the first time into different regions of the country. While ITV reality show I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! was the UK’s most popular show of 2013 – drawing in an average of 12.4million viewers – it was not universally favoured. Viewers in the north of the country and . in Wales were gripped by the I’m A Celebrity showdown between . contestants Amy Willerton and Olympian Rebecca Adlington. The South East and East Anglia were the biggest fans of Strictly Come Dancing, won by Abbey Clancy (pictured) But in the South it failed to register among the top five shows of the year. Instead, viewers in the Home Counties preferred period dramas such as Downton Abbey and Call The Midwife. In London, the top-rated show of  the year was the men’s Wimbledon tennis final, where Andy Murray ended the nation’s 77-year wait for a trophy by defeating Novak Djokovic. But while the Scot’s match transfixed 2.4million Londoners – as well as another 1.3million viewers north of the Border –  it failed to make the top five anywhere else in the UK. Instead, those in many regions preferred to watch home-grown dramas and presenters. In the North-East, any programme featuring presenting duo Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly was a hit. The region’s top show of the year was Britain’s Got Talent, with I’m A Celebrity and Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway close behind – all fronted by the pair. Across the Pennines, however, viewers preferred Coronation Street. The ITV soap is based in Weatherfield, a fictional town located in Greater Manchester. And the capital’s favourite soap, perhaps unsurprisingly, was BBC1’s EastEnders, set in London’s East End. Some of the regional differences are harder to explain, though. ITV’s hit drama Downton Abbey has its most loyal fanbase in the South-West, where it beat Strictly and Children In Need to the top spot. But in the South-East, the most popular drama was BBC1’s Call The Midwife, based in 1950s east London. The figures were compiled for the Daily Mail by official ratings analysts Attentional. Using a sample of 5,000 homes, the researchers were also able to put together the favourite shows of 2013 among Daily Mail readers. Top of the list was Downton Abbey, with . an average of 1.6million Daily Mail readers per episode. It narrowly . beat Call The Midwife, which typically had 1.4million readers tuning in, . with Strictly Come Dancing in third place. Britain's Got Talent proved most popular in the North East, as did any programme hosted by Geordie duo Ant and Dec . A recent survey found one in four of us would rather watch television than take part in traditional hobbies such as visiting museums or playing sport. A quarter of people now list their favourite pastime as watching  television, compared with just 5  per cent who say they enjoy playing a team sport. Only 4 per cent said they spent their free time playing a musical instrument, while fishing was enjoyed by just 2 per cent. Stamp and coin collecting, which had its heyday in the 1950s, is now only favoured by 2 per cent, while model making has a following of a mere  1 per cent. Campaigners said the demise of these traditional hobbies was symptomatic of a society preoccupied with celebrity and reality TV. The survey, by Santander, also showed only 8 per cent spent time visiting museums while 9 per cent said they enjoyed the arts.","Overall I'm A Celebrity was the most viewed show in 2013 .

Humiliated: A key part of the evidence given by £332,900-a-year human resources director Lucy Adams (pictured) was shown to be false . The BBC’s leadership system is ‘broken’, a damning report  into the severance payoff scandal has concluded. Publishing the findings of a five-month inquiry into the fiasco, the Commons public accounts committee said it had found ‘a failure at the most senior levels of the BBC’. The committee’s chairman, Margaret Hodge, said she had uncovered ‘a culture of cronyism that allowed for the liberal use of licence fee payers’ money’. MPs raised fears that some BBC figures may have lied to Parliament over the debacle – in which £369million was handed to departing staff over eight years. Earlier this year, eight senior corporation figures – including its chairman and director general – were subjected to intense cross-examination as two parliamentary hearings sought to uncover the full extent of the payoffs. But in today’s report, MPs said they feared some – including its £332,900-a-year human resources director Lucy Adams – may have deliberately misled the inquiry. Miss Adams was humiliated in September when a key part of her evidence was shown to be false. She had originally claimed to have no knowledge of an email about a £1million payment to former deputy director general Mark Byford, but later admitted she had in fact been one of its key authors. The report said of her evidence: ‘We remain very concerned about the veracity of other parts of the oral evidence we heard. Misleading a select committee constitutes contempt of Parliament.’ In the three years to December 2012, the BBC handed £25million to 150 departing senior managers. In an internal email discovered by the PAC, Miss Adams referred to such payments as ‘sweetners’ [sic]. Evidence: Miss Adams had originally claimed to have no knowledge of an email about a £1million payment to former deputy director general Mark Byford, but later admitted she had in fact been one of its key authors . Asked to investigate the scandal, the National Audit Office found 22 of the 150 payments exceeded contractual limits, at a cost of £1.4million. In his evidence to the committee, former director general Mark Thompson sought to justify a decision to hand Mr Byford £300,000 more than he was contractually owed by saying that he wanted to keep Mr Byford, a close friend, ‘fully focused’ until his departure. But the PAC said such excessive payments were ‘unacceptable’ and identified a ‘prevailing culture in which cronyism was a factor that allowed for the liberal use of other people’s money’. The committee also attacked the Corporation’s governing body, the BBC Trust, for failing to crack down on the scandal. It said: ‘Our examination of severance payments exposed a dysfunctional relationship between the BBC executive and the BBC Trust that casts doubt on the effectiveness of the BBC’s governance model... at present the governance model is broken.’ A BBC spokesman said director general Lord Hall has now capped the payments at £150,000. The BBC Trust said: ‘We greatly regret that licence fee payers were let down by this episode. They are entitled to expect that their money is spent wisely.’ Mr Thompson said: ‘There is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by anyone at the BBC in relation to these payments.’ The BBC spokesman added: ‘Lucy Adams made it clear to the committee that she did not attempt to mislead them and while not immediately recognising a document that was being referred to, she clarified her position as soon as Parliament returned.’ Unimpressed: The committee's chairman, Margaret Hodge, said she had uncovered 'a culture of cronyism that allowed for the liberal use of licence fee payers' money'","Commons committee finds 'failure at the most senior levels of BBC'

But the National Portrait Gallery looks set to ruffle Establishment feathers with its latest commission. The gallery has awarded coveted hanging space to an artist whose back catalogue includes this raunchy painting of a pregnant Kate Middleton. Nick Lord, 25, was crowned Portrait Artist of the Year and his work will be hung at the National Portrait Gallery . His previous work includes this imagined portrait of a pregnant Kate Middleton wearing a leopard print bra, done partially in spray paint . Nick Lord, 25, was crowned winner of the Sky Arts Portrait Artist of the Year competition last night. Hosted by presenter Joan Bakewell and comedian Frank Skinner, the show whittled down more than 1,800 entrants from around the country to find the nation’s most promising new portrait painter. Mr Lord won with an oil painting of Iraq war veteran Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry, who won the Victoria Cross in 2005 after saving fellow soldiers from two ambushes. The competition’s judges – including National Portrait Gallery director Sandy Nairne - described the work as ‘magnificent, bold and accomplished’ and it will hang in the gallery for a week. But it is his earlier works that are likely to raise eyebrows. Earlier this year, the former graffiti artist from Cardiff – who used to make a living painting model trains for his father’s business – completed a rather less flattering portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge. He won for this portrait of Victoria Cross winner LCpl Johnson Beharry which the judges called 'magnificent' Mr Lord with the Victoria Cross winner. The artist said having his work displayed at the National Portrait Gallery is a 'dream come true' Imagined topless apart from a leopard print bra, the heavily pregnant royal was depicted on in a suggestive pose that is unlikely to win the artists many friends in Buckingham Palace. And the royal family are not the only ones who have cause for alarm. As part of his prize, Mr Lord has been awarded a £10,000 commission to paint double-Booker prize winning author Hilary Mantel. The portrait will be hung prominently in the British Library when it is unveiled next spring and will become part of its permanent collection. Mr Lord could not be contacted to discuss his unusual artwork yesterday. But speaking ahead of the final Sky Arts episode he did shed some light on his unconventional artistic background. He said: ‘I like to listen to hip hop on my headphones while I’m working. The music helps me to focus and it goes hand in hand with the whole underground culture of graffiti art. Mr Lord said listening to hip hop as he works helps him to 'focus and it goes hand in hand with the whole underground of graffiti art' ‘I started out learning to do graffiti writing when I was a teenager. For me, it is a form of fine art. ‘I’m sure some of the great artists of the past would have painted with a spray can if they had the chance, although it’s impossible to say which ones. Perhaps [Austrian painter] Egon Schiele. He added: ‘I generally paint my subjects from photos rather than from life. I like to capture them in moments that reveal their personalities rather than in formal poses. ‘It is a dream come true to have one of my paintings in the National Portrait Gallery. It is the perfect start to my career.’ Mr Lord – who has a degree in fine art - has now started work on his portrait of Mrs Mantel, best known for her historical novel Wolf Hall. He said: ‘I’ve met her twice and taken lots of photos. She is an amazing character and said it is up to me how I paint her. Of course I am nervous because I want her to like it, and it will be seen by everyone who goes into the British Library.’","Nick Lord previously painted imagined portrait of a pregnant Duchess of Cambridge in a leopard print bra .

After rising to fame as Harry Potter’s sidekick, it seems Rupert Grint is working some magic of his own on his property portfolio. The 24-year-old has set up a new company to manage the income from his multi-million pound housing empire, the Daily Mail can reveal. And while his Potter alter-ego Ron  Weasley spent his time fighting the forces of darkness, Grint appears to have embraced his slightly more sinister side – by naming it Eevil Plan Properties. The news comes as the star’s other  company, Clay 10 – set up to manage his film earnings – posted its first pre-tax profits of £8.6million. The £12.9million Grint property empire is spread over a 20-mile radius in Hertfordshire, at the heart of London’s commuter belt. The actor bought three properties around his home village for a combined £9.2million. Another three, worth £3.7million, are registered in the names of his mother Joanna, 46, and father Nigel, 49, a former racing car driver listed as a co-director of Eevil Plan. Grint, who is worth around £24million, lives in an 18th century mansion bought for £5.4million. Set in 22 acres, it has five reception rooms, six bedroom suites and indoor and outdoor swimming pools. His parents live in a nearby £3.35million mansion, also owned by their son and complete with a lake and putting green. Grint and his father co-purchased another detached house for £495,000 which they renovated and now rent out for more than £2,700 per month. Investment: This rambling Grade II-listed 16th century farmhouse has seven bedrooms and sits in eight acres of land, boasting a tennis court, swimming pool and stables . Rupert renting: Grint and his father bought a detached home are renting out for £2,700 a month . Family business: Rupert's parents' Hertford townhouse which they run as a boutique hotel . Following the success of the Harry Potter films, Mr and Mrs Grint paid £975,000 for a Hertford townhouse, which they run as a boutique hotel charging up to £150 per night. They also own two large farmhouses worth a combined £2.7million, both in their names. It is believed Eevil Plan Properties will manage the combined rental income from the properties as well as profits from any future sales. Two other property investment companies owned by Nigel Grint – Wicked Ideas and Wicked Investments – are now dormant, presumably because he has gone into business with his son. Screen success: Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley with Emma Watson as Hermione and Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . But while Grint’s property endeavours are thriving, the same cannot be said for his screen career. Last year he appeared in box-office flop Into The White, in which he played a stranded World War Two aviation gunner. And last month Super Clyde, a series pilot in which Grint played a fast food worker who inherits millions, was rejected by American network CBS. It is a stark contrast to his Potter co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, whose stage and screen careers have flourished.","Harry Potter star sets up new company Eevil Plan Properties .

Sufficient: When children are left to decide their portions they learn to recognise when they are full (file picture) Passing bowls of food around the table at family-style meals can help beat child obesity by teaching youngsters about portion control, new research suggests. For when children and child-care providers sit around a table together at mealtime, children learn to recognise when they are full in comparison to when food is pre-plated for them, the latest study shows. The findings came from a study of feeding practices of two to five-year-old children in 118 child-care centres in the US. It report's author, Brent McBride, the director of the University of Illinois Child Development Laboratory, said: 'Family-style meals give kids a chance to learn about things like portion size and food preferences. When foods are pre-plated, children never develop the ability to read their body’s hunger cues. 'They don’t learn to say, okay, this is an appropriate portion size for me. Rsearcher Dipti A. Dev said: 'Instead of asking Are you done? teachers should ask children, Are you full? Or they should say, If you’re hungry, you can have some more, explained Dev, who is developing a packet of best feeding practices to share with providers. 'Asking the right questions can help children listen to their hunger and satiety signals,' she said. The Illinois research is the first study to evaluate whether child-care providers are adhering to the academy’s guidelines for feeding practices. Most providers did promote healthy feeding by serving nutritious foods and not pressuring children to eat or restricting them from eating. Head Start programs stood out though as having the best policies and feeding practices. Leaning to stop: A researcher from the University of Illinois said children eating when the are not hungry teaches them not to take notice of their body signals (file picture) In fact, Head Start teachers who use family-style meals are strong advocates for them, the researchers said. 'Teachers who don’t do family-style meals have all these reasons that they don’t: there’s too much waste, it’s messy, young kids don’t have the developmental skills-the fine motor control-to do that,” McBride said. 'But Head Start teachers were telling us ways you could help develop those fine motor skills: for instance, using scoops in the sandbox or pouring water in the water table,' he added. 'When you first do easel painting with a two-year-old, it’s really messy because they don’t have fine motor control, but you still do it even though it’s messy. 'The same thing is true for family-style meal service. It may be messy at first until they develop the appropriate skills and learn to pour the right way or hold the cup as they’re pouring. It’s a developmental progression,'he said. 'If children don’t want to eat, teachers shouldn’t urge them to eat anyway out of concern that the kids may get hungry before the next meal or snack is served. 'If a child doesn’t eat at one meal, he’ll compensate for it over a 24-hour period. Making kids eat when they’re not hungry is probably the worst thing you can do. It teaches them not to pay attention to their body’s signals,' Dev said.","Children learn to recognise when they are full if food is not pre-plated .

Simon Dyson has spoken for the first time since being found guilty of breaking the rules and insisted all his fellow professionals have welcomed him back to the fold. The Englishman is competing in the Abu Dhabi Championship on Thursday, his first outing since a three-man hearing adjudged he deliberately tapped down a spike mark in the BMW Masters in China last October, and handed out a two month suspended sentence. ‘It has been great. I can’t say enough about my fellow pros. Nobody has said anything and everyone has been coming up and talking to me,’ said the Englishman. As if to prove the point, Rory McIlroy wandered over soon afterwards and embraced Dyson. Back in the swing: Simon Dyson returns to European Tour action this week in Abu Dhabi . Error: Dyson was disqualified from the BMW Masters for tapping down a spike mark on the line of his putt . The 36-year-old is competing here with a renewed love for the game after coming uncomfortably close to losing his livelihood for a period of time. In the end, the three-man hearing decided his dishonesty was a ‘moment of aberration’ rather than ‘premeditated,’ and opted for a heavy fine plus a ban of the suspended variety. 'There was never any intent there whatsoever,’ said Dyson. ‘I’ve never done it in the past and I’ll never do it in the future. There was no intent whatsoever to try to get an advantage. I’m just going to be very careful from now on, make sure I’m on the ball and be very professional about everything I do.' Dyson resolved to put the matter behind him from the moment he walked out of the hearing early last month. ‘As soon as it was over it was over. That was the way I looked at it. My wife and I have not spoken about it,’ he said. ‘What is in the past is in the past and I can’t do anything about it. I wish I could change what happened but nobody can, and so I just have to get on with it and carry on.’ Show of support: Rory McIlroy, pictured learning a traditional local dance in the Emirate on Tuesday, was spotted hugging Dyson ahead of the controversial Englishman's return to European Tour action . On course: The Northern Irishman practices on the par three fourth hole during the pro-am . Favourite: McIlroy, here teeing off on the 15th hole on Wednesday, heads the betting ahead of the tournament . Perhaps the only good thing about the . whole sorry saga that left his fellow pros incensed at the time is that . it reminded Dyson of the charmed life he leads playing professional . golf for a living. ‘It’s just nice to be back and doing something I love doing,’ said Dyson. ‘There was a good chance it might have been taken away from me for a couple of months if the panel had seen it differently. Now I’m probably as focused as I have ever been. I will get my head down now and try to get back into the world’s top 50.’ Was it the lowest moment of his career? ‘I don’t think you can get any worse, really,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t very nice. To be honest, I hadn’t really been enjoying my golf for a couple of years, I had fallen out of love with it, and then to have it topped off by that was pretty low. But, like I said, it has made me realise I love what I am doing.’ Dyson will begin on Thursday morning in the company of fellow Englishman Mark Foster and Scottish rookie, Jamie McLeary. Look who's in town: Phil Mickelson begins his year on the course in the Emirate this week . Hard yards: Martin Kaymer practices at the pro-am on Wednesday prior to the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship . The man to beat: Europe's No 1 Henrik Stenson . Henrik Stenson was the first man to secure his place in Europe's Ryder Cup team and the European No 1 plans to be the first to arrive at Gleneagles in September. Stenson's brilliant form at the end of last season saw him make history by winning the FedEx Cup and Race to Dubai in the same year, not to mention gathering enough world ranking points to effectively qualify for the Ryder Cup with nine months to spare. The 27-year-old, whose last appearance in the event came in 2008, has accrued 240 points, almost 70 more than Martin Kaymer needed in 2012 to secure the final qualifying berth on the world points list. But he has not played at Gleneagles since 2004, or seen the alterations made in recent years under the supervision of course designer Jack Nicklaus, and will therefore get there as soon as possible after playing in the Tour Championship in Atlanta - assuming he qualifies for the event he won last year. 'It's been quite a few years since I played the Gleneagles tournament,' said Stenson, who shot an opening round of 81 in 2002 as he went through the first of two major career slumps. 'I'm thinking about maybe making my way over a little bit early to get rid of some jet-lag and possibly get another round in before everybody else gets there. That's a more likely scenario than making a trip there while I'm in Scotland because we've got both the Scottish Open and the Open Championship to look after in the summer.' Stenson begins his 2014 campaign in the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship this week, an event he has played every year since it started in 2006 but has yet to win. 'I've got two second places and it's the one tournament down in this part of the world that I haven't won,' the world NO 3 added. 'I managed to win in Dubai in November (at the DP World Tour Championship), the Desert Classic in 2007 and Qatar in 2006. 'It would be a nice one to add to the collection here having made Dubai my home for almost 10 years. It's nice to be back and it's going to be a challenge of course.' Phil Casey, Press Association .

Manchester United midfielder Anderson could become a Fiorentina player by the end of the day. Talks are ongoing between the player, his representatives and Fiorentina sporting director Daniele Prade. The finer details of the fee are also being discussed this afternoon but there has been a late bid from Napoli who are keen on the midfielder and Brazilian defender Fabio. VIDEO  Scroll down to see Bayern centre half Dante join his teammates for a sing-along . On the move: Anderson looks set to leave Manchester United for Fiorentina this month . Manager Vincenzo Montella has other problems which are also affecting British clubs. Fiorentina have injuries to Giuseppe Rossi and Mario Gomez which means they are rivalling Premier League sides for the trio of strikers being offered around on loan from Italy; Roma's Marco Borriello and Juventus pair Mirko Vucinic and Fabio Quagliarella. Fiorentina have also asked Chelsea about the availability of Demba Ba. Italian job? Chelsea striker Demba Ba is wanted by Fiorentina . A few other players could leave Old Trafford this week with Cardiff City manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer having a choice to make between loan bids for either United defender Fabio or his team-mate Wilfried Zaha. Sunderland may be willing to let hat-trick hero Adam Johnson leave the Stadium of Light. Although his three goals were invaluable in Saturday's impressive win at Fulham, there has been interest from home and abroad in the Englandwinger, who has struggled for consistency since his much heralded move from Manchester City. However, it is understood the asking price for the 26-year-old is around £14million and a if a team wanted to sign him on loan then the fee is £2m plus wages of around £60,000 per week. Set fee: Sunderland want £14m for Adam Johnson (right) - or £2m for a club to take him on loan . Heading north? Gus Poyet is keen to sign Brighton's Liam Bridcutt . Sunderland are continuing to overhaul their squad as Gus Poyet begins to remould his team. Augsburg are reviving a move for striker Ji Dong-won after Borussia Dortmund switched their sights to other targets and there remains concern over Jack Colback's future with Everton weighing up an offer in this window. Poyet remains keen on Brighton's Liam Bridcutt while they have enquired about Maxi Lopez at Catania and talks are ongoing for Argentinian trio Ignacio Scocco, Santiago Vergini and Mariano Andujar. A loan deal for QPR's Julio Cesar looks too expensive at this stage, although they have also been offered Shaun Wright-Phillips and Andy Johnson. On offer: Sunderland have been offered QPR duo Shaun Wright Phillips and Andy Johnson . Hull City manager Steve Bruce plans to step up his bid to sign Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic today. A £5.25million fee has already been agreed with Everton for Jelavic but the player's preference has always been for West Ham. That has made Bruce wary of last minute hitches and he is keen to get agreements wrapped up as quickly as possible. West Ham remain reluctant to match Hull's bid while Crystal Palace and Stoke have also shown an interest. Aston Villa, who had been mooted as a potential suitor, are not in the bidding. On the move: Hull are in talks to sign Everton striker Nikica Jelavic . Bruce is clearing the decks to make way for new blood. Misfit striker Nick Proschwitz has an offer from Ukraine while Aaron McLean is wanted by Peterborough and Bradford, who are also keen on Dagenham & Redbridge forward Rhys Murphy. Target: Hull are also keen on signing Shane Long from West Brom . To cover all bases, Bruce sent scouts to watch Nantes striker Filip Djordjevic again yesterday. The 26-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, failed to add to his season's nine-goal tally against Lorient but set up team-mate Ismael Bangoura for a late winner. West Ham may have to buy Joleon Lescott from Manchester City rather than pin their hopes on a loan. Manuel Pellegrini insists Lescott is staying but West Ham manager Sam Allardyce believes the defender will be available in the last week of the window. However, City have more to lose with their player out of contract in the summer and, should he return to them at the end of a loan in May, they would still have to pay the remainder of his contract until July at around £90,000 a week. No loan: West Ham will have to buy Joleon Lescott rather than take him on loan . West Ham may also look to take over the contract. Allardyce and his scouts are on the look out for midfielders as they prepare to lose Ravel Morrison to Fulham. Mohamed Diame and Matt Jarvis also interest other clubs. They will hear later on Monday whether they have been successful in their bid for a work permit for Lacina Traore. Carlton Cole is also free agent from today after his short-term deal expired. Waiting game: West Ham expect to hear the outcome of Lacina Traore's work permit hearing . A few Championship clubs are monitoring Scunthorpe United goalkeeper Sam Slocombe. The 25-year-old signed an extension to his contract last year Slocombe has been Scunthorpe's first-choice goalkeeper for the past two-and-half-seasons, but had to bide his time for first team football after joining the club from Bottesford Town five years ago. Italian club Chievo have shown interest in Hull's captain, Robert Koren, on a pre-contract basis. Koren is out of contract in the summer and is yet to be offered a new deal by the club. He has played 13 games and scored two goals in the Premier League so far this season. On the move? Robert Koren is wanted by Chievo on a pre-contract agreement . Other clubs from England have shown an interest for the summer but aren't allowed to sign on pre-contract basis due to regulations. Leeds United are willing to let Luke Varney, 31, Paul Green, 30, Adam Drury, 35, and El Hadji Diouf, 32, all leave Elland Road on free transfers. Manager Brian McDermott had his first team players in for a dressing down on Sunday following their disastrous 6-0 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday and pulled no punches in terms of spelling out what had to change in the coming weeks. On his way: El Hadji Diouf could be allowed to leave Leeds on a free transfer . McDermott is keen to bring another striker after signing Jimmy Kebe and Cameron Stewart on loan . Varney has had interest shown in him from Bristol City, Blackpool and Blackburn Rovers. Manchester City could secure the third member of Nigeria's highly talented U17 World Cup squad by the end of this week. City have already tied up Kelechi Iheanacho, who won the Golden Ball at the U17 World Cup after scoring six goals, on a pre-contract agreement ahead of his 18th birthday in October and held negotiations with midfielder Chidi Nwakali and his family. Which four Premier League stars from two different clubs were spotted playing a knockabout game of football in London's Battersea Park among friends the day after a cup tie and just 24 hours before one was due to play again in the Premier League? Now they are talking to a boy who has been dubbed the 'Nigerian Neymar' Musa Yahaya. Yahaya scored four times in seven matches at the U17 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates and has been scouted by Tottenham, as well as teams in Portugal and Spain. The 16-year-old's agent Babawo Mohammed has held talks with City and a deal is expected to be confirmed shortly. Yahaya, who describes Barcelona's Andres Iniesta as his footballing hero and has admitted he dreams of playing for Real Madrid, was coy over his immediate future when asked at the end of last year. He told African website MTNFootball: 'I am not going to talk on that one [where he wants to move], I have a manager in Babawo Mohammed. I have left that for him to handle. He knows me and knows what is good for me.'

Tensions have escalated on Christmas Island where nine asylum seekers have reportedly stitched their mouths shut with dental floss and threatened to sew their eyes together in protest at conditions inside the detention centre run by the Australian government. A substantial hunger strike is also underway, with 78 refugees refusing to eat this week. There are fears that nine Iranian men who had sewn up their mouths may further harm themselves by stitching their eyes together in the coming days, according to The Australian newspaper. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection's health contractor IHMS was closely monitoring the group, the paper reported. Encampment: The buildings at Christmas Island where asylum seekers are being held by the Australian government . Controversial: The government has been heavily criticicsed for secrecy about the treatment refugees who have tried to come to its shores . The group are among more than 2000 asylum-seekers – including hundreds of children – who have been held in indefinite detention inside the detention centre on Christmas Island, an Australian territory, some since last July. The men were protesting at ‘living in limbo for six months’, according to the Refugee Rights Action Network. The Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said: ‘This particular incident is under control, it's being managed by the service provider at this time’. ‘I get regular updates on what is happening there. It is a difficult environment when you've had people since July who have been at Christmas Island now for some time. That Christmas Island (detention) population now is down to around 2100. It is well below the capacity levels of Christmas Island. And the changes that have been made at Christmas Island since the riots took place some years ago have been significant. Idyllic: The remote island is hundreds of miles off the north west coast of Australia . ‘There have been major upgrades to security infrastructure, and security procedures in those places to assist, manage and de-escalate events such as these.’ Mr Morrison said yesterday that the majority of asylum-seekers now held on Christmas Island would soon be sent to facilities on Nauru or Papua New Guinea's Manus Island where their asylum claims will be assessed. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young expressed concerns for the Christmas Island refugees and the ‘toxic culture breeding in these detention centres’. ‘It is distressing to hear vulnerable refugees being pushed to breaking point and sewing their lips together in sheer desperation after being locked up for too long and enduring the government's practice of separating families’ Senator Hanson-Young said yesterday. ‘I am especially concerned for the hundreds of children locked inside the camp. No child should bear witness to the horrors of long term detention and the desperation it causes.’ The protest news came as an asylum seeker was yesterday charged with making a bomb threat on a plane taking refugees from the Australian mainland to the Christmas Island detention centre. It is alleged the 27-year-old Lebanese national threatened to blow up the chartered jet which was transporting him and other asylum seekers last Thursday. He has been charged by Australian Federal Police with making a false threat.","Nine men stitch mouths together, fears they will also sew their eyes shut .

A violent sex offender who fled Canada before allegedly sexually assaulting a boy in a Seattle alleyway has given a sickening 'thumbs up' in court as he was sent to prison for just two months. Michael Sean Stanley, 48, grinned and posed for cameras as he appeared in Seattle Municipal Court on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to harassing West Seattle residents and resisting arrest. Stanley, who was previously jailed in Canada for sexually assaulting two mentally-challenged boys, was sentenced to seven months in prison but, because of time served, he will only serve two. He has not yet been charged in relation to the alleged sexual assault, but the Kings County Prosecutor's Office told KIRO that they are continuing to investigate. Scroll down for video . Sick: Michael Sean Stanley gives a 'thumbs up' as he is sentenced to 2 months in prison in Seattle this week . At ease: He smiled and posed for pictures three months after he was arrested for harassment and resisting arrest. He is also accused of sexually assaulting a teenage boy before he was arrested . His sentence comes after he was arrested in the early hours of October 22. Police said Stanley had met a 16-year-old boy at a . west Seattle grocery store, struck up a conversation with him and walked him to an alley where police say he plied the teen with alcohol. He then grabbed the teen and sexually assaulted him, police said. The boy pulled a knife and was able to run away and contact authorities. Detectives believe the incident . happened before police received several calls reporting noise in an . alley and Stanley threatening someone who asked him to be quiet. When . police arrived, Stanley became combative and said he had a knife. He . appeared intoxicated, according to authorities. He was arrested and . jailed for investigation of harassment. 'I've got to be responsible for my actions so that's why I'm agreeing with it,' Stanley said to the judge as he was sentenced on Tuesday. Scene: He allegedly attacked the boy in this West Seattle alleyway after plying him with alcohol . Part of his plea deal included evaluation and treatment for alcohol dependency. 'I can't be walking around with a gallon of alcohol and think everything's going to be okay,' he added as the judge nodded. 'Once I get the treatment I think everything will work out.' The incident came after Stanley, who is a U.S. citizen, cut off an electronic monitoring bracelet in Canada and managed to sneak across the border. Search: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police released this photo after he fled from Canada . Police in Edmonton issued a public warning when they learned that he had taken off the monitoring bracelet and warned U.S. counterparts that Stanley might try to cross the border. Officials described him as an untreated, violent offender who posed a significant risk. But U.S. officials allowed him to enter the country after determining he was not the subject of an extraditable arrest warrant, CTV News reported. Canadian officials announced it would not seek to extradite him because the charges he faced - breach of recognizance, mischief and driving charges - didn't 'warrant engaging the extradition process'. He registered as a sex . offender with the King County sheriff's office in Washington and listed his address as . an intersection just a block away from Pike Place Market. It's also near a preschool, even though he had been ordered to stay away from children in Canada. Before the October incident, there was no reason to arrest . Stanley earlier as Canada hadn't pursued an extraditable warrant and . he wasn't wanted for any crimes in the United States, authorities said. Edmonton, Alberta, police spokesman Chad Orydzuk told The Associated Press that Stanley's arrest in Seattle was 'unfortunate but we can't provide comment. It's not our file.' He has a criminal record stretching back as far as 1987. Caught: Stanley, pictured in court with defense attorney Nick Gross in October - days after Canadian authorities decided not to extradite him, despite previously warning that he was 'violent' In 2011, he was released from prison after a 32-month prison sentence for assault and forcible confinement. It stemmed from claims that he lured two mentally challenged boys into a washroom, blew crack smoke in their faces and sexually assaulted them, according to records. He was being monitored by police under a . peace bond when he fled the country. His peace bond had 20 conditions, . including one ordering him to stay away from children. He also sexual assaulted an elderly woman and exposed himself to children, according to parole records. When he surfaced in Seattle, Stanley denied responsibility for many of the convictions and said he was just looking for a new life. 'I said I had enough,' he told KIRO. 'I'm leaving this country because it hasn't been good to me. All they've been doing is belittle me, shafting me, making me look like I'm some kind of menace, some creep, some pedophile, some kind of guy that didn't deserve to be out in the community.'

At a preliminary hearing on Monday, Mr Fletcher told the court how he tried to fight off Petersen after being shot in the abdomen as he got ready for work on September 18 last year. Petersen, who was going through a bitter . divorce with Mr Fletcher's sister, Bonnie, allegedly smashed his way . into the house through a window. Accused: Hans Petersen has been charged with attempted murder . According to court documents seen by ABC News, Petersen's estranged wife said he 'went into an emotional tailspin and a depression' after losing . his job. She also claimed .

A self-described pimp accused of murdering three people last year in a fiery shootout on the Las Vegas Strip had the sentencing in an unrelated case delayed a second time. Attorneys for Ammar Harris, 27, asked for additional time to review court transcripts from a sex assault conviction in September as he awaits trial later this year in a shocking triple murder. Mr Harris was found guilty last year of sexual assault and robbery charges stemming from a June 2010 case – his attorneys have argued they may appeal on grounds he did not receive a fair trial. Then and now: Ammar Harris used to boast about money, fast cars and faster women - now he spends his days locked behind bars or in court while heavily guarded and severely restrained . The convicted sexual predator’s public defenders asked for the extra time because they were only assigned to his case after his conviction. He received new attorneys after his initial counsel withdrew from the case after citing a difference of opinion in defense strategy. ‘If I was being sentenced, I would want my attorney to know what happened at my trial,’ defense attorney Robert Langford said at Wednesday’s hearing, according to the Las Vegas Sun. Prosecutor David Stanton opposed the postponement because he plans to present the sex assault conviction to a jury that will decide whether he faces the death penalty for the incident on the Las Vegas Strip. Silent, but expressive: Mr Harris was quiet during an apperance Wednesday in Clark County District Court . Mayhem: Mr Harris also faces charges three capital murder charges for a horrifying car chase and shooting on the Las Vegas Strip . Mr Harris stands accused of chasing a man down the Strip after an argument in a nightclub parking lot, shooting him dead and causing a chain reaction crash that saw a taxi explode as stunned tourists watched in horror. Three people died – the man police say was shot dead by Mr Murphy and the cab’s driver and passenger. A fourth person in the car shot at by Mr Murphy was shot multiple times but survived, five others suffered minor injuries. Authorities went on a multistate manhunt before finally finding him. He was charged with three counts of capital murder. Violent man: Mr Harris has been convicted of sex assault and faces three capital murder charges . The accused killer posted multiple videos online showing a flashy lifestyle with fistfuls of $100 bills, fast cars and a harem of faster women. Mr Murphy’s only previous criminal convictions were for a felony weapons charge and marijuana possession. He’s now cooling his heels in Clark County Detention Center while awaiting his next court date.","Ammar Harris faces life in prison after being convicted last year of sexual assault from a 2010 case .

Eighty-six current and former members of Yale University fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon are being sued over a fatal crash at the 2011 Harvard-Yale football game. Sig Ep brother Brendan Ross, then 21, was driving a U-haul van full of kegs to the frat's spot near the Yale football field on November 19 when the vehicle sped up and hit three women. Nancy Barry, a 30-year-old student from Salem, Massachusetts, died in the crash. Yale student Sarah Short and Harvard employee Elizabeth Dernbach were also injured. Fatal: 30-year-old Nancy Barry died after being hit by a U-Haul van driven by a Sigma Phi Epsilon brother in 2011. Her estate and one of the other women injured are filing new lawsuits against all 86 men who were members of the fraternity at the time . Crash: Sig Ep brother Brendan Ross, then 21, was behind the wheel of a U-Haul van when he sped up and hit three women at the 2011 Harvard-Yale football game . Someone to blame: Representatives for Barry's estate and Ms Short were forced to file a lawsuit against all the men who were members of the frat at the time since the national organization refused to take responsibility for the incident . Ms Short and Barry's family have filed new lawsuits against all 86 men who were Sig Ep members at the time of the crash after the fraternity's national organization denied responsibility in the incident. 'Obviously, suing 86 fraternity brothers isn’t what we wanted to do,' Paul Edwards, the attorney representing Barry’s estate, told the New Haven Register. 'But the national fraternity organization was claiming this wasn’t a Sigma Phi Epsilon-sponsored event. This clearly was a fraternity-sponsored event.' Legally, the national organization says, it has nothing to do with the local chapter which isn't covered by their insurance. Joel Faxon, the attorney representing Ms Short, told the Yale Daily News that he has never in his 20 years of litigation seen a national organization shirk from protecting its local chapter. But Mr Edwards believes the national organization has stepped up partially since 84 of the brothers being sued are being represented by the same lawyer - Jeremy Platek of White Plains, New York. Shirking responsibility: Sig Ep's national chapter says it legally has nothing to do with the local Yale chapter, which doesn't fall under their insurance either . Stepping up: But it seems the national chapter is helping the current and former brothers who are defendants in the case since most of them are being represented by one lawyer . Pay out: The new lawsuits are expected to be in court for a number of years. If awarded damages, the men will most likely pay with their parent's automobile or homeowner's insurance . Damages: Barry's estate is hoping to get several million dollars in the suit, while Ms Short is going after seven figures to cover her more than $300,000 in medical bills . 'I would be surprised if all the fraternity members had collectively gotten together and decided to hire one lawyer on such short notice,' Mr Edwards said. 'The odds are very high that he was appointed to represent them by the national fraternity.' The men started making their first court appearances between January 6 and 14 and the trial is expected to last a number of years. Barry's estate is seeking several million dollars in the lawsuit, while Ms Short hopes to get seven figures to cover her more than $300,000 in medical bills. Representatives of Barry and Ms Short's estate have filed a total of four lawsuits including suits against the university, City of New Haven and other parties. There is a possibility that the four lawsuits may be joined into one in the future. If Barry and Short are awarded damages, they will most likely be paid with money from the brothers' parent's automobile or homeowner's insurance.

An 18-year-old man caught at Edmonton International Airport with a pipe bomb but was permitted to fly has been sentenced only to probation. Skylar Murphy, from suburban Edmonton, was caught Sept 20 by security screeners with a pipe bomb – he was then allowed to board an international flight. A source told MailOnline that he pleaded to the court that he simply forgot the bomb was in his bag and didn't mean to bring it to the airport. The misguided teen received one year of probation, was order to pay $500 to the burn unit of a local hospital and also a $100 fine, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Black powder and a pipe bomb were found in Mr Murphy’s luggage by Canadian Air Transport Security Authority screeners, but they did not detain him or immediately alert authorities because they are not permitted to, according to a CATSA official. ‘Screening officers do not have the authority to apprehend or detain passengers,’ CATSA spokesman Mathieu Larocque told the CBC in a statement. ‘When they see something potentially illegal, the(y) contact the police.’ The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were not contacted until four days later, Mr Murphy was arrested when returned to Edmonton Sept 27. The lax approach to ensuring the safety of fliers infuriated the country’s top transportation official. ‘This individual should not have been allowed to board his flight, and it is unacceptable that CATSA waited four days before seeking the RCMP’s assistance,’ Transport Minister Lisa Raitt told the National Post. Mr Larocque declined to comment further about the incident, saying only that ‘for security reasons, I can’t go into details about our procedures at the checkpoint, which include our protocols with the police.’ 'A breakdown': A CATSA spokesperson told MailOnline there was a breakdown in security procedures - 'we should have called the police... we didn't' Mr Larocque separately admitted to MailOnline that was a procedural breakdown. 'We saw something unusual in his bag… we should have called the police right away, we didn’t.' A call to the RCMP’s Edmonton Airport detachment was shuffled to an airport spokesperson. The RCMP officer who answered the phone said Mounties are not publicly commenting on the incident. An airport spokesperson also declined to comment. A message left with the Crown Prosecutor's office was not returned. The lack of public comment on the incident has not gone unnoticed. ‘Everyone is dodging the bullet,’ a security expert told CTV. ‘No one wants to take responsibility for what is obviously a series of mistakes.’ Except for Mr Murphy, he pleaded guilty last month to possession of an explosive substance. Edmonton is the eighth busiest airport in Canada with just over one million passengers per year.","Skylar Murphy was caught Sept 20 with a pipe bomb at Edmonton International Airport .

West Ham want the Premier League to take firm action against Fulham if it is proved they tapped up Ravel Morrison. The midfielder is at the centre of a row between the clubs after Fulham head coach Rene Meulensteen said he knew that Morrison, 20, wanted to move to Craven Cottage and confirmed that their bid for him had been rejected by West Ham. It is understood that Fulham offered £7.5million for Morrison and midfield partner Mo Diame, which was dismissed by West Ham, who value Morrison alone at £10m. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Rene Meulensteen insist Ravel Morrison wants Fulham move . In demand: Ravel Morrison (right) is believed to want to leave West Ham before the transfer window closes . Staying for now: Fulham have had a bid rejected for West Ham youngster Morrison .

Tackles 15 . West Ham claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. After Fulham beat Norwich 3-0 in their FA Cup third-round replay on Tuesday, Meulensteen said an offer for Morrison had been ‘knocked back’ and added: ‘Yes. He does want to come here.’ Asked how he knew, Meulensteen, who worked with Morrison at Old Trafford, responded: ‘I’ve known him obviously for a long, long time.’ West Ham are understood to want swift action against their fellow relegation strugglers, who are 16th, one place and one point above them. On Wednesday Fulham issued a statement which read: ‘When asked the question regarding the player Ravel Morrison in last night’s press conference, Rene Meulensteen answered honestly, that a bid had been made to West Ham United for the player and that the bid had been rejected.’ Impact: Morrison impressed in his cameo appearance against Fulham earlier this season . Bid: Fulham are believed to have offered £7.5m for both Mohamed Diame (left) and Morrison . Morrison has 18 months left on his current deal worth £15,000 a week and contract talks to improve it broke down last month. It has emerged that a clause in Morrison’s contract means his wages leap to £60,000 if an offer of £10m is lodged and he has made his desire to leave clear to friends. At a press conference last week West Ham manager Sam Allardyce denied the player had told him he wanted to move to Fulham but added: ‘I’m not surprised there’s another rumour about Ravel Morrison.’ Not having it: Sam Allardyce wasn't happy with the rumours about the youngster's exit . He is West Ham’s top scorer with five goals in all competitions but has played only once since December 21, with a groin injury given as the reason for his absence. A Premier League spokesman  confirmed that a complaint had been received from West Ham and that they are looking into the matter. Both clubs will be asked for their observations and the League will decide if Fulham have broken any rules. Hammer time: West Ham have been granted a work permit to sign Anzhi Makhachkala forward Lacina Traore . Meanwhile, Monaco’s 6ft 8in striker Lacina Traore has been granted a work permit to join West Ham  on loan. Carlton Cole has signed a new 18-month contract after his short-term deal ran out on Monday. His wages are in the region of £40,000. It represents a remarkable turn-around since last summer when the former England striker was regarded as surplus to requirements but he has  scored four goals in 11 league games since October. ‘I’m really happy,’ said Cole. ‘I’ve worked hard to get to the position I’m in right now. I just want to help the team push on and get further up the table.’ Strike duo: Carlton Cole, seen here with fellow forward Andy Carroll, has signed a new 18-month contract with West Ham . Andy Rolls, West Ham’s head of sports science, has beaten off stiff competition to land a role at Arsenal as one of four first-team physios. Sportsmail understands that Rolls decided to quit his job last October, long before Hammers co-owner David Sullivan questioned the medical advice behind signing Andy Carroll. Sullivan said Carroll would not have been signed had they known he would be out for so long, adding: ‘When we signed him we were assured by the medical staff that the very, very latest he would be back was September 1.’ According to the Premier League: .

Osborne: 'A country of the size and global reach of Britain leaving would be very bad for the European Union' A British exit from the EU would be a disaster for its other members, Chancellor George Osborne warned yesterday. In one of his most significant speeches to date on the nation’s future in Europe, he said: ‘A country of the size and global reach of Britain  leaving would be very bad for the European Union.’ The Conservative leadership is seeking to regain the initiative on the issue of Europe following a demand from 95 backbench MPs for Britain to demand a unilateral veto over any EU edict, a move that critics say would mean the end of the  single market. The Tories have promised that if they remain in power, an in/out referendum on British membership of the EU will be held by 2017. Mr Osborne suggested he wanted to chart a course between hardcore Eurosceptics who want to leave the EU no matter what, and pro-Europeans who once urged Britain to enter the euro. ‘The one thing that unites those who urged Britain to join the euro and those who advocate leaving the EU is their shared conviction that any change is impossible and that there is no other way,’ he said. ‘There is another way. It is time to change the EU and to change Britain’s relationship with it and then to place  the decision in the hands of the  British people. ‘Europe urgently needs economic reform. Eurozone integration is necessary for the euro to survive, but proper legal protection for the rights of non-euro members is absolutely necessary to preserve the single market and make it  possible for Britain to remain in the EU. ‘I believe it is in no-one’s interests for Britain to come to face a choice between joining the euro or leaving the European Union. ‘We don’t want to join the euro, but also our withdrawal from a Europe which succeeded in reforming would be bad for Britain. Decisive: The Chancellor made the comments during a pan-European conference on EU reform . Fittingly, Osborne spoke under a portrait of the great British railway engineer George Stephenson . ‘And a country of the size and global reach of Britain leaving  would be very bad for the European Union.’ Mr Osborne was speaking at a conference organised by the Fresh Start group of Conservative MPs, who want a reformed relationship with Brussels, and the Open Europe think tank. The Tories are backing a ‘red card’ system which would allow Britain to block any EU proposal, or undo an existing law, if it won the support of a small number of other EU countries. They are also examining a proposal by Andrea Leadsom, head of the Fresh Start group and a member of the prime minister’s policy board, that Britain should be given an effective veto over financial services legislation.This would allow a member state to block any proposal if a vital national interest is at stake – an argument which could apply to Britain’s financial services industry, given its importance to the economy. Mr Osborne warned that from 2016, under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty agreed by the last government, the Eurozone countries would be able to impose financial services legislation on nations across the EU. He said that Britain would demand reforms to ‘protect the collective interests of non-eurozone member states’. Warning: Mr Osborne said that from 2016, nations will be able to impose pan-European financial services laws . Mr Osborne told the conference: 'Over the last six years, the European economy has stalled. In the same period, the Indian economy has grown by a third, the Chinese economy by 50 per cent' Mr Osborne said there was a need for reform of the EU, at a time when Europe is falling behind the rising economic powers of Asia. He added that the financial crisis of 2008 had dramatically exposed the underlying weakness of the European economy. The Chancellor said: ‘We knew there was a competitiveness problem in Europe before the crisis. ‘But the crisis has dramatically accelerated the shifts in the tectonic economic plates that see power moving eastwards and southwards on our planet. Over the last six years, the European economy has stalled. ‘In the same period, the Indian economy has grown by a third. ‘The Chinese economy by 50 per cent. Over the next 15 years Europe’s share of global output is forecast to halve.’ Labour is refusing to back the idea of an in/out referendum. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘The Conservative leadership seems to be spending more time negotiating with  their backbenchers than negotiating with Europe to deliver  real reform.’ But the CBI business group said Mr Osborne had set out a ‘compelling’ case, adding: ‘A growing EU is in the UK’s national interest so we must build alliances with other member states to get the reforms we need.’","Chancellor claimed European Union relies heavy on the strength of the UK .

The musician appears set on releasing the beverages under a name associated with the rock movement his band started in the 1990s. The 45-year-old's application for the drinks brand trademark was published for consultation by the Intellectual Property Office last Friday. Blur bassist Alex James has applied to trademark a drink called Britpop at the Intellectual Property Office . He would join a long line of musicians . who have entered the drinks market, following in the footsteps of bands . such as Iron Maiden and Madness. It is not explicitly stated what kind of drink James is hoping to launch, and the beverage could be alcoholic or non-alcoholic. The term Britpop was popularised in the 1990s to describe the British music scene dominated by Blur and rival band Oasis. James is most famous for his work with Blur (pictured), but has in recent years gone into the cheese market . Britpop is a term that emerged in the early 1990s to describe the British music genre of the time, which was dominated by Blur and rival band Oasis. Bands such as Suede, Supergrass and Pulp were also associated with the term. Britpop music was largely influenced by older British guitar music, with bands citing the Kinks, the Beatles and the Smiths as influential. The Britpop movement was considered as directly at odds with grunge music, which was also popular at the time. Although still primarily renowned for his musical accolades, in recent years James has entered the food market by launching a range of cheeses. He owns a number of trademarks, including Goddess, Figgy Pudding and Little Wallop, and sells them under the range name, Alex James Presents. He began selling cheeses after moving to a farmhouse in the Cotswolds and, in 2008, won a Best Goats' Cheese honour at the British Cheese Awards. Two year later, he was chosen to be a judge on the awards. Despite this success, Asda stopped selling his range of cheeses in 2012 â€“ just a year after taking them on. In 2011, James brought together his two great loves by launching the Alex James Presents Harvest, a food and music festival held on his Oxfordshire farm. James now hosts The Big Feastival, run in conjunction with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, on his land.","Alex James appears set on releasing the beverages under Britpop brand .

Pubs and nightclubs routinely break a law which says they should refuse to serve people who are already drunk, research has claimed. Actors staggered to the bar at more than 70 pubs, bars and nightclubs in one northern English city and ordered a vodka and coke in a 'loud, slurred' voice. Some 84 per cent of the time they were served - with the success rate rising to 94 per cent on Friday nights and 96 per cent after midnight. Had a few too many? Just a sixth of actors pretending to be drunk were turned away by bar staff (stock photo) A study said the actors were often served even though bartenders recognised they were drunk - by remarking on it to colleagues or rolling their eyes. Campaigners say preventing sales of alcohol to already drunk people would protect long-term health and reduce the strain on the NHS. The study was carried out by a team at the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Violence Prevention at Liverpool John Moores University. Four student actors aged 20 to 22 - two male and two female - were recruited through auditions and taught how to act drunk. Their impersonation included slurred speech, being unsteady on their feet and having difficulty focusing and was tested on police. In each attempt to buy alcohol, one actor pretended to be drunk while a second actor took on the role of sober friend. Binge: Despite the actors staggering and slurring words, a fifth were asked if they wanted a double shot . The 'drunk' actor stumbled to the bar and used 'loud, slurred speech' to ask the price of a vodka and coke, before fumbling over their purse or wallet as they bought the drink. The attempts - made from Wednesday to Sunday evenings between 9pm and 3am - were successful at least 60 per cent of the time on every night. The hit rate was the lowest on Wednesdays when the actors were refused service two out of every five times. Before midnight, the actors would be served on average 78 per cent of the time, but this rose to 96 per cent after midnight. In almost one in five sales (18 per cent), bar staff even tried to sell the candidates more alcohol - by suggesting they 'double up' their vodka and coke. Overall, 73 randomly-selected pubs, bars and clubs were tested in an unnamed city in the north west of England. The study's authors said: 'UK law preventing sales of alcohol to drunks is routinely broken in nightlife environments, yet prosecutions are rare (three in 2010). 'Nightlife drunkenness places enormous burdens on health and health services. Lax: It is illegal to serve alcohol to people who are already drunk - or try to buy it for them - under the 2003 Licensing Act, but just three people were prosecuted in 2010. Pictured: File image of women on a night out . 'Preventing alcohol sales to drunks should be a public health priority, while policy failures on issues, such as alcohol pricing, are revisited.' The Licensing Act 2003 makes it illegal to sell alcohol to someone who is drunk, or even to try and buy it on their behalf. In theory offenders can be fined Â£1,000, but prosecutions are almost unheard of. The study found venues with 'indicators of poor management' - such as cheap alcohol promotions, young bar workers, young clientele, crowds, poor lighting, rowdiness, dirtiness and high levels of drunkenness - were most likely to serve the fake drunks. The actors were almost always successful in venues which had bouncers (95 per cent of the time), compared to a two-thirds success rate in those without. The authors added: 'Although our study focused on one city, a lack of prosecution for sales to drunks throughout England suggests this is typical of nightlife environments nationally. 'With policies to prevent alcohol-related harm by increasing alcohol prices failing to be implemented, increased use of legislation preventing sales of alcohol to drunks should be considered a public health priority.' The study was published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.","Study sent actors to 73 pubs, bars and clubs in the north west of England .

A young woman accused of killing her sister in a car crash wept in court today as she described how their brother had died serving in Afghanistan just months earlier. Rosie-Ann Stone, 21, allegedly caused the . death of her sister Jennie, 28, by careless driving after they . were both in a queue behind a slow-moving lorry on the A165 in East . Yorkshire in February last year. She broke down in tears as she told of how Private Gregg Stone was killed while serving abroad with the British Army in June 2012. Trial: Rosie-Ann Stone (left), 21, is accused of causing the death of her sister Jennie Stone (right), 28, by careless driving after they were both in a queue behind a slow-moving lorry on the A165 in East Yorkshire . Stone, who arrived at Hull Crown Court with her parents and three surviving brothers, said: 'My brother Greg was in the Yorkshire Regiment, an infantry soldier in Burma company.' She added that she and her family were all wearing red jackets given to them by Private Stone's colleagues from the 3rd Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment. 'It’s the company jacket,' said Stone. '(Gregg) was never without his. He wore it all the time. Tragic: Private Gregg Stone was killed while serving in Afghanistan with the British Army in June 2012 . 'When he died his comrades donated their jackets in memory of him to the family. We’ve all got one.' Jennie Stone died when her blue Peugeot 206 car smashed into a . tree next to the A165, near the village of Fraisthorpe, on February 18. Prosecutors . claim Rosie-Ann pulled out of the queue on the A165 in her Vauxhall Astra to . overtake the slow-moving lorry -  but did not see that Jennie, who was further back, . had also pulled out to overtake the truck. But today, Stone wiped away tears as she described how she had had no idea her sister was behind her on the road between Hull and Bridlington. She told the jury that she had driven her . sister’s son Charlie, now 10, to school in Skipsea earlier that morning, with Jennie also in the car. She added that they had planned to go shopping in Scarborough and . she had set off first to get some things from her flat in Bridlington on . the way. Stone claimed she had looked in her mirror to check the road was clear, before pulling out in an attempt to overtake the lorry. However, she suddenly felt her car collide with another vehicle, which 'skimmed' her - causing the three vehicles to be abreast in the road. Stone added that she had instantly 'twigged' that it was her sister driving the other car. 'I saw blue and I saw (Jennie),' she told the court. 'I saw her blond hair and I twigged almost instantly.' She added that her sister’s car had been travelling faster than hers . when it veered in front of the lorry and crashed into the tree. Tribute: Stone's parents and three surviving brothers (pictured) - who were in court to support her - were wearing red jackets given to them by Private Stone's colleagues from the 3rd Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment . Sisters: Prosecutors say Rosie-Ann (left) pulled out of the queue in her Vauxhall Astra to overtake the truck - but did not see that Jennie (right), who was further back, had also pulled out to overtake in her Peugeot 206 . 'It suddenly shot across the road,' she said. 'I instantly thought the truck was going to hit her. 'I was running back down towards the tree to get to her. I saw her in the car. I was screaming. 'I tried to get near her and some people took me away. I remember screaming something about my sister.' She added: 'I wanted to be with Jennie. Nobody was with her. She was on her own.' When asked by Patrick Palmer, defending, about her sister, Stone said: 'She was like a mum to me when we were younger. As we got older, we were inseparable.' Denial: Rosie-Ann Stone, pictured with two of her brothers, denies causing death by dangerous driving . Earlier in the day, the jury had heard how Stone described Jennie as a 'speed demon' in police interviews. She had claimed her sister took risks as a driver and had been involved in a number of minor accidents. Stone, who denies causing death by dangerous driving, told police: 'I knew she was a speed demon. I knew she was comfortable taking risks in her vehicle. I think she took a risk and misjudged the situation.' And yesterday, lorry driver Steven Wragg told the court how he initially thought Jennie was ‘driving like a bat out of hell.’ ‘I looked in my mirror and saw something flying through the air,' said Mr Wragg. 'I must have seen some sort of collision with plastic flying. I was not sure what it was. ‘It . hit the tree very hard. There was an orange flash and a bit of smoke. I . saw a girl running down the road. I said “That was a big one”. She . shouted: “That was my sister”.’ The trial continues.","Rosie-Ann Stone, 20, is accused of causing death of her sister Jennie, 28 .

She was suffering from severe depression when she throttled her mother Carol, 62, who had told her that she was planning to sell the family home where they lived happily together. Parr recollected little of what had happened though she spoke of disappointment her mother no longer wanted to live with her . Emma Parr, 38, turned on waitress Carol Parr, 62, following her struggle to cope with the bitter break up . Mrs Parr’s body was discovered by a relative after colleagues raised the alarm when she failed to turn up for work. Police . later found her daughter, who had attempted suicide just weeks earlier, . driving her car in her pyjamas 17 miles away. When questioned, the . university department manager told police she remembered little of what . had happened, except ‘disappointment’ that her mother had decided she . didn’t want to live with her.

You had a good job, happy family, friends and good . health. No one, not even with the most effective crystal ball, could . have foretold what was to happen. ‘What . you did on that dreadful night was largely outside your control.

Miss Parr’s life began to crumble following a break-up in January last . year. Simon Berkson, defending, told the court she had been devastated . by the end of her romance at a time when she may have had hopes of . settling down and starting a family. The . court heard Miss Parr became introspective and her relationship with . her mother was ‘strained and tense’. In May, she took an overdose of . paracetamol in a suicide attempt. She became anxious about the damage . she might have done to her liver, and began following her mother around . and sleeping in her bed at night. On . the evening of June 9 last year, Mrs Parr had had enough of her . daughter’s behaviour.

A four-year-old girl was hailed a hero today after calling police when a bookshelf collapsed on her mother, knocking her unconscious. Lexi Cooper refused to panic when her mother Nicola Ellis, 25, was knocked out at bedtime by the bookshelf falling off the wall and trapping her underneath. The child, who is in reception class in primary school, switched on a Simpsons cartoon DVD for her younger brother and sister, found her mother’s mobile in another room, dialled 999 and gave full details of herself, family and home address. Cool as a cucumber: Lexi Cooper, aged four, saves her mother's life in a seven minute call to the emergency services . During the call, lasting more than . seven minutes, Lexi said her mother was 'asleep' and 'a shelf had fallen . down'. She said she could clamber over the bookcase to get to the front . door. She said she had tried to 'wake' her mother, before being overheard shouting ‘wake up mummy' at the request of the operator. As police and paramedics rushed to the house near Blackburn, Lancashire, Lexi said: 'I’ll open the front door, over that thing. 'I . can usually get over it. I’m bigger than my brother and sister. I’m by . the front door.' She was waiting on the doorstep as police arrived. Nicola . was rushed to Royal Blackburn Hospital where she was treated for a . dislocated shoulder, neck, wrist and pelvis injuries following the . incident on December 5. She has since made a near full recovery, apart . from suffering with concussion. Today . Lexi, who has been given a police commendation, said: 'I just phoned . 999 like they told us at school. I was shouting ""wake-up mummy, wake up . mummy"". She was under the bookcase and I had to climb over her. 'I . have always been a good, big girl and I didn’t cry. I put the Simpsons . on for my brother and sister and I was very calm and I was like mummy. I . let the ambulance men in and they went upstairs and made mummy better.' Proud mother Nicola with Lexi, who was hailed a hero by police for her quick actions in helping her mother and comforting her siblings . Nicola said: 'Lexi is so clever - I owe her everything and my life. She was just fantastic. 'I could have been under that bookshelf for hours or even the night. I am just so thankful and proud of Lexi for what she did. 'She . stayed very calm and was very brave to ring 999 to get help. She had . recently had a talk at school about the emergency services which meant . she knew what to do in this situation.' Nicola . said she was at home with Lexi, along with her two other children . two-year-old Harry and one-year-old Amelia, where she was tidying things . away on a bookcase in Lexi’s bedroom. The bookcase stuffed with Lexi”s favourite Disney books and DVDs then fell on top of Nicola. Nicola added: 'It hit me on the front of my head, it must have been more than six foot high. 'I . didn’t even feel the impact of the shelf hitting me. I collapsed and . was out cold under the bookcase. It was a heavy old thing. 'Lexi told the operator that mummy was just lying there. She was on the phone to the operator for over seven minutes. 'I . had never taught her our address but she had heard me tell taxis where . to take us. She is very nosey and obviously when I said the address she . had remembered it.' Little Lexi on her toy phone, but when it came to making an important call on the real thing, she showed a maturity way beyond her years. Lexi was given a commendation for her bravery by Lancashire Police Commander Ch Supt Chris Bithell, and the Mayor of Blackburn, Councillor Salim Mulla. Contact centre agent Sophie Roscoe, who fielded the 999 phone call, was also presented with a commendation for her professionalism in handling the call, keeping Lexi calm and talking until help arrived. Sophie said: 'It was Lexi who was the real star. She was absolutely fantastic and that call will stay with me. 'Despite the awful situation, and her two siblings beside her, she remained focused throughout and adhered to every instruction that I gave her. I honestly can’t believe that someone so young could be so truly fantastic.' Ch Supt Chris Bithell said: 'Lexi gave excellent commentary to the call operator and followed all the instructions she was given, remaining on the phone until the police, who were first at the scene, arrived. She even opened the door for them. 'I think this incident is a good opportunity for parents to remind their children of the importance of knowing when to ring the emergency services should the appropriate situation arise.' Here's the edited transcript of Lexi's cool-as-a-cucumber call to the emergency services: . Lexi said: 'I just called 999 like they told us to do at school.'

Archaeologists believe they have discovered the oldest depiction of spiders in the world. A ‘very unusual’ carving, which is thought to be of arachnids, was found on the west wall of a sandstone valley in the Kharga Oasis in Egypt. It is thought to have been carved in 4,000 BC by prehistoric man, although the identification of the lines as spiders is rather tentative and no one is sure why they were drawn. The rock panel, which is now in two pieces, is said to show a few spiders and a web (next to the spider on the far left) as well as extra enigmatic lines that could be insects trapped by the spiders, plants or tubes of silk, Professor Ikram said . The panel, discovered in the desert some 108 miles (175km) west of Luxor, is positioned to be illuminated by the morning sun. Egyptologist Salima Ikram, a professor at the American University in Cairo who is also co-director of the North Kharga Oasis Survey Project, told LiveScience the find is ‘very unusual’. ‘The images are noteworthy if they are indeed spiders, as these would be unique depictions of such creatures in Old World rock art,’ she wrote in the journal Sahara. The rock panel, which is now in two pieces, shows a few spiders and a web – next to the spider on the left – as well as extra enigmatic lines that could be insects trapped by the spiders, plants or tubes of silk, Professor Ikram said. Interestingly, a piece of rock broken off of the main panel shows what could be a harvestman insect, which is drawn in a different style to the other ‘spiders’. The panel was discovered in the desert some 108 miles (175km) west of Luxor is positioned to be illuminated by the morning sun. It is thought to have been carved in 4,000 BC by prehistoric man . While archaeologists are excited by the discovery, they are also baffled as no other examples of this kind have ever been found in Egypt or anywhere else in the world. Spiders are also rarely depicted in ancient Egyptian carvings, adding to the mystery. The only hieroglyphs showing spiders are from religious texts depicting the ‘opening of the mouth’ ritual, which was performed on a mummy to restore its senses for use in the afterlife, according to Professor Ikram. Archaeologists believe the spiders perhaps held religious significance to prehistoric people. Arachnologist Hisham El-Hennawy said Argiope lobata spiders that live in the western and eastern deserts of the country and bask in the sun in the middle of their orb webs, could have been the inspiration for the ancient artwork and have religious meaning to people. Arachnologist Hisham El-Hennawy said Argiope lobata spiders (pictured) that live in the western and eastern deserts of the country and bask in the sun in the middle of their orb webs, could have been the inspiration for the ancient artwork and have religious meaning to people . Writing in the Sahara article, she said: ‘This would combine the force of the sun and the ability of this solar creature to survive its heat successfully, and thus be worthy of reverence or totemic allegiance.’ There is one theory that the artwork might have acted as a warning as some spiders are known to bite people, which would have threatened prehistoric people. Of course, someone might just have liked spiders and carved images of them in a rock without intending it to have a meaning, Professor Ikram said.","Carvings are thought to have been made in 4,000 BC by prehistoric man .

Presenter John Humphrys last night said the BBC is too big and staff numbers could be cut by a third . John Humphrys last night claimed the BBC is too big, obsessed by box-ticking and could be cut by a third. He warned the corporation could lose its right to charge the licence fee when its funding next comes under review and he said that ‘would be the end of the BBC as we know it.’ The veteran interviewer - who has presented the Today programme for 26 years - said he was devoted to the BBC but felt its original values had become distorted over time. He added: ‘There are times when you worry about that. ‘The values of (first BBC director general) Lord Reith, were to ""inform, educate and entertain"". I do worry we get those a little muddled at times. Entertainment gets pushed up too far.’ Mr Humphrys, 70, made his comments during a wide-ranging interview about his career at a public meeting of the Media Society in London. Reflecting on his BBC career, he said he was often infuriated by the layers of bureaucracy that require journalists and editors to adhere to strict guidelines rather than exercise their own judgment. He said: ‘We didn’t have the word ""compliance"" in the past. I’m deeply uneasy about it. ‘As far as I’m concerned if you’re the editor of the Today programme, you make decisions based on your knowledge and judgment rather than go through a book and say ""am I fully compliant?"" ‘There is an amazing amount of box ticking and it worries me. ‘I won’t say there haven’t been times when I’ve used fairly robust language on the editorial floor and made my views clear to my superiors.’ Asked whether the BBC should be slimmed down, Mr Humphrys said: ‘It’s too big. We could take out a third of it I think.’ He added: ‘The most important people are the journalists. We could cut out layers of management and still produce the news.’ Mr Humphrys also criticised the BBC for failing to put enough women on air, particularly after they reach middle age. Last year, Mishal Husain joined the Today team, bringing the number of female presenters on the programme to two, compared with three men. Mr Humphrys said: ‘We’re getting there. But it has been outrageous, in particular it doesn’t have enough older women. Mishal Husain (right) joined Today last year, bringing the number of female presenters on the programme to two . ‘I’m still slogging away at the age of 103. ‘I look at breakfast TV and I see a sea of young shining faces. Where are the older women? ‘Look at all the newsreaders. Anna Ford started as a beautiful young presenter. ‘She is still beautiful but she isn’t as young. There are aren’t any older women reading the news.’ Mr Humphrys’ comments are just the latest in a string of stinging attacks by current and former BBC staff. In November, presenter David Dimbleby called on director general Tony Hall to slim down the corporation and hand parts of the licence fee to its commercial rivals. And in a separate attack, former TV news head Roger Mosey said the BBC was too big and too left wing. Mr Humphrys also criticised the high levels of pay earned by BBC stars, singling out Jonathan Ross . The comments prompted the director of television Danny Cohen to call for his staff to stop criticising the BBC and get on with their jobs. He said: ‘I’m finding a little too often that people who work for the BBC and are well rewarded for it are quick to attack or criticise the organisation in public rather than deal with any issues or concerns internally.’ Mr Humphrys also criticised the high levels of pay earned by BBC stars, singling out Jonathan Ross, who earned £18million while he was at the corporation. Asked if the BBC should be more careful with licence fee payers’ money, he said: ‘There’s no doubt about it. I say that in the knowledge I earn a lot of money myself.‘The amount paid to Jonathan Ross wasn’t just outrageous, it was silly. ‘I remember I had lunch with the former director general (Mark Thompson) shortly after I first commented on that and he just didn’t see it.’ Asked whether he thought the BBC’s funding could be cut when its charter is reviewed in 2017, Mr Humphrys said: ‘I think the licence fee will continue. I think questions will be asked again, as they should be, about the strategic direction of the BBC. ‘I profoundly hope it does (continue) because if it doesn’t that’s the end of the BBC as we know it. ‘Will it be in line with inflation, will it be a generous settlement? I suspect probably not.’","He warned the corporation could lose its right to charge the licence fee when it comes under review spelling 'the end of the BBC as we know it'

Nearly five years after the attack on August 8, 2009, Mr Hutton, from Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, will receive financial support for his future care, which he will require for the rest of his life. South Yorkshire Police have now admitted full liabilities for his injuries after expert evidence gathered by his solicitors showed he would have made a full recovery if he had received medical treatment for his head injury earlier. Mr Hutton’s family has claimed the physical, cognitive and behavioural difficulties he suffers as a result of the injuries mean he ‘needs help with almost everything he does’. The case had been due to be heard at a five-day High Court trial in March, his lawyers will now work with medical experts to gather evidence on the settlement he would need to support him for the rest of his life before negotiating over a figure with the force. Stacey Clements, an expert serious injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are now working to secure a full settlement which will then be managed by our Court of Protection team to ensure it can provide for Dean’s lifetime needs. Liability: Mr Hutton's head injury was not recorded by staff . at Rotherham Main Street police station (pictured) and it was only when he began . having a fit and had blood around his mouth that he was rushed to . hospital . 'Had the police taken note of the fact that Mr Hutton had suffered a head injury and consequently recognised the symptoms he showed through the night, he would have received medical attention much sooner.' According to a critical report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), Mr Hutton appeared well when police and paramedics were called to reports of an assault on Mount Pleasant Road in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, in August 2009. He was arrested over a failure to appear at court and taken to custody, and although the custody sergeant was made aware he had received a head injury, no record was made of this information. He vomited while in custody and was found to be difficult to rouse, but according to the IPCC report, his ‘actions were regarded as a result of him being drunk’ until a force medical examiner found him bleeding from his nose. After being taken to Rotherham District Hospital, he was immediately transferred to Sheffield Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield where he underwent emergency surgery, but the damage had already been done. Mr Hutton currently receives specialist rehabilitation and physiotherapy and needs support with daily activities such as planning his day and organising his life. He attends Dearne Valley College three times a week for courses in Maths, English and IT and enjoys going out into the community with his support workers and going to the gym. His father Roy said: 'Before his brain injury, Dean was completely independent but now needs help with almost everything he does. 'When we first heard about the brain injury we were so worried and we prepared for the worst. But Dean is battling back bravely and his rehabilitation has helped him come a long way. 'He is now attending college and we are just relieved that the police have admitted responsibility, meaning we don’t have to go to a full trial and that we should be able to access the care and rehabilitation Dean will need for the rest of his life. 'We are angry that Dean’s injury was not accounted for and so dealt with by police officers sooner. We are thankful to the IPCC for investigating and hope that nothing like this is allowed to happen to others again. 'Nothing can change what happened but thankfully now we can begin to move on with out lives knowing that Dean’s future will be secure.' Brett and James Garbutt were found guilty of grevious bodily harm with intent and were sentenced to seven years and five months and five years imprisonment respectively. A police spokeswoman said: 'South Yorkshire Police can confirm that it has accepted liability for Mr Hutton’s injuries. Our thoughts remain with Mr Hutton, his family and friends.”Our solicitors are in consultation with Mr Hutton’s legal team.'","Dean Hutton, 26, was hit over the head with a scaffolding pole in 2009 .

On the video, tourists in car behind the couple can be heard urging them to reverse, with one man screaming 'Stop the car ... reverse, reverse, they're going to die'. William Mabassa, general manager at the National Park said the elephant was in Musth, a periodic condition in males that makes them aggressive when their testosterone levels rise by up to 60 times. It also had an injury, which is believed to have increased its aggressiveness. Mr Mabassa told the Telegraph: 'As they were driving behind the elephant, probably also taking a video of the elephant in front of them, the elephant apparently decided to turn around'. 'Unfortunately they switched off the engine - because if you minimise noise an elephant would not attack you - (but) unfortunately the elephant attacked,' he added. Park . officials later shot the elephant, a decision Mr Mabassa defended by saying: 'Our rangers reported that the same elephant bull had been involved in previous fights with other dominant bulls since it has been in musth phase'. African . bull elephants can weigh up to six tons. Describing the December 30 . attack, park spokesman William Mabasa said: ‘The elephant suddenly . stopped, turned around and rapidly walked towards the vehicle, which was . stationary. ‘It charged at them, attacked the vehicle and flipped it over off the road into the thick bushes.’ The elephant was disturbed by the tourists' car as it drank at a watering hole .

The Marquess of Bath has sparked fears amongst residents on his estate that he is planning to mine under their homes by invoking an ancient right. The colourful aristocrat claims he has the right to the minerals under vast swathes of west Wiltshire, which he argues dates back to when the title included a much larger area of land. Much of the land has since been built on or sold off but Lord Bath is claiming his Longleat Estate, which boasts Longleat Zoo, held on to the mineral rights for whatever is underneath the ground. 'Controversial' aristocrat: The Marquess of Bath has raised fears he is planning to frack on his estate after invoking an ancient right. He argues that the rights to the minerals under a vast area of west Wiltshire date back centuries . Council officials have responded by informing worried villagers how to contest the claim and tried to reassure them that fracking or mining is not an immediate concern. Heather Abernethie, town clerk in Warminster, Wiltshire, said fracking had been raised as a concern because the area is close to the Mendips which has been mooted for possible test drilling. However, she added that Lord Bath's application is a legal technicality and he would need to be granted a licence to extract gas. Longleat House (pictured) is on Lord Bath's 9,000 acre estate along with Longleat Zoo. But the aristocrat has applied for mineral rights to a larger area of land they argue was 'vested in the land owner centuries ago'. 'Residents have expressed worries that following recent publicity these letters have been sent out in order for the rights owner to have access to the mineral rights for the purposes of fracking. 'The Land Registry makes it clear that any oil or gas belongs to the Crown, not to the owners of the land, and they would have to grant licences to extract them.' She explained that until 2002, interests in mines and mineral rights existed but did not need to be recorded on the Land Register. 'However, following the Land Registration Act, the interests needed to be recorded by October 12, 2013, in order to be protected,' she said. 'Longleat believes the interest in the mineral rights has been in the ownership of the family for hundreds of years and has registered this interest accordingly.' Residents on the Longleat estate (pictured) are worried that Lord Bath plans to begin fracking as the area is close to the Mendips which has been mooted for possible test drilling. Council officials are advising them on how to respond .

Loans: Sandra Lowe, pictured, is accused of lending money to friends before demanding it back 'with menaces' A foster carer ran an illegal business lending her friends thousands of pounds in cash then threatened them when they could not repay the money, a court has heard. Sandra Lowe is alleged to have made a 'nice little profit' running the loan business - but the 50-year-old insists she was only acting out of charity. The 50-year-old mother of two from Manchester also allegedly had an unlicenced catalogue business in which she charged commission for ordering goods for her friend. Lowe, who works as a foster carer for her local council, denied eight charges of unlawfully engaging in the activities of a consumer credit business without a licence and one charge of blackmail at Manchester Crown Court. Cafe owner Maria Turner, who said she was 'like a sister' to Lowe, told the court that she borrowed up to £50,000 from her friend over a seven-year period to repay her mortgage and other debts. She ended up repaying £125,000, according to the prosecution - and shortly before Lowe was arrested in 2012, she was told she still owed £40,000. Ms Turner told the court she felt like an 'idiot' for losing track of her finances and not monitoring how much she owed the defendant. She said that her money troubles had 'snowballed' because she was under 'enormous pressure' running a sandwich shop, a chip shop, an ironing business and nine rental properties. Her home was repossessed in 2011 and she went to stay with Lowe, who had to talk her out of committing suicide, she told the court. But the next day, Ms Turner claimed, her friend forced her to sign a document saying she still owed her £52,000, even though she had been handing over hundreds of pounds a week for several years. Sobbing, she told the court: 'When I saw the £50,000 I owed it kind of sent me to another place. I thought, ""I'll never do it - I'll be paying it until I'm 70.""' It is alleged that Lowe 'demanded money with menaces' between May and July 2012. 'Threats': Jurors were read a series of text messages allegedly sent from Lowe to Maria Turner in which she said she would tell her friend's relatives about her debts . The court heard excerpts from a series of text messages allegedly sent by Lowe to Ms Turner threatening to reveal her debts to family members if she did not repay them. One read: 'You better get the f***ing money in or I will tell your son. I will come to the shop and will take it out of your till. Don't think you can get away with missing this week. I need my money.' In another, Lowe allegedly wrote: 'Please let's not be playing catch up, don't think you know how p***ed off I am, I need my money ASAP, if you don't pay I will tell.' A third read: 'Sorry for the text but you bring it on. I want £575 in my bank so start putting it in now. Can't believe after how I've been. I'm sick of playing catch up. I'm being as fair as I can. 'I don't want it split in drips and drabs, my patience is running really thin. I'm struggling because of you, friend or not.' Ms Turner said: 'I was waking up to it and going to bed with it. It was awful, terrible, disgusting. It makes your body shake... you can't focus, your mind's in a spin. You want to rob a bank to pay it.' She added that only Lowe's arrest allowed her to escape her spiralling debts, saying: 'It would still be happening now if this didn't happen. I just used to pay it.' Ms Turner told the court that she was never told what the interest rate was on her loans. The prosecution also allege that Lowe ran an unlicensed catalogue business, supplying friends with goods she had ordered from firms such as Kays and Argos and claiming a profit on them. Following her arrest, Lowe insisted that she did work for Kays, although the prosecution says the firm has no record of her. Opening the case, Ben Mills, prosecuting, told the jury: 'She says this was all charity work - me loaning money for nothing, me administering all these loans for nothing.' The trial continues.","Sandra Lowe, 50, allegedly lent up to £50,000 in cash to friend Maria Turner .

Cannabis is currently categorised as a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and is listed in Schedule 1 to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. It was upgraded from a Class C to a Class B drug in 2009 due to fears over its effect on mental health, and that stronger varieties of the drug were becoming more readily available. Many campaigners for the legalisation of cannabis say that doing so would cut out the criminal gangs which supply the drug. They also say that if legal it could be regulated, making it easier to stop children getting hold of the drug and prevent it from being cut with other harmful substances. Pro-cannabis campaigners also say that the drug is not as dangerous as legal substances tobacco and alcohol. Some research has also suggested the the THC compound in cannabis can be beneficial for conditions including chronic pain, Multiple Sclerosis, and reducing nausea in those undergoing chemotherapy or living with AIDS. However, scientists say there are links between cannabis use and mental health problems, including short-term effects such as anxiety and paranoia, as well as contributing to a relapse in pre-existing conditions such as schizophrenia.

They were called the Promettes and were on hand to give directions, offer medical advice, or just brighten up the day of tourists to the East Sussex seaside town. Now the marketing team at VisitBrighton are looking reinstate a 21st Century equivalent - but this time men can apply too. Scroll down for video . Strict entry procedure: In the Fifties, Promettes had to be female and at least 5ft 7in tall . The Promettes dressed in sharp-cut uniforms, with white gloves, and black suede shoes . The new volunteers will welcome visitors, offering help and advice on where to stay and what to see. They will also provide maps and information on the latest events and attractions. However, the new volunteers will be slightly less elegant than their predecessors - wearing branded polo-shirts and cagoules instead of air hostess style suits and specially designed handbags. The entry standards will also be less stringent thanks to modern equality and employment laws. In the Fifties when sexism was rife, only attractive women could apply and had to be a minimum height of 5ft 7in. The girls posing on one of the rides at the Brighton Pier. They had a strict code of conduct, and although they carried lighters they were not allowed to smoke themselves . The launch of the new scheme has been welcomed by former Promettes, who operated out of a caravan at weekends and carried cigarette lighters - but were not allowed to smoke themselves. Audrey Page, from Brighton, was a Promette for the 1956 tourism season having heard about the role while at Vogue Mannequin School. Hazel Legg, now 85, was chief Promette in 1956 and 1957 and said the job was a pleasure . She said: 'I think it’s a very good idea to bring them back, although things are a lot different now from how they were then. 'We used to help people with their chairs, posting their cards or if somebody got sunburnt or was not feeling well, telling them where they needed to go. 'Anyone doing it now will have to be quite knowledgeable. I think it will be a more difficult job than it was before. 'They are going to have to be ready for just about anything and carry quite a bit of information with them.' Lorna Whitlock, who Brighton’s chief Promette in 1959, said: 'Every girl wanted to be a Promette. It was like being a mini celebrity. 'We were always being asked out. Guys used to dare each other to ask us out.' Mrs Whitlock said she was paid two guineas for a weekend’s work and combined that with working at the Royal Albion hotel. As well as giving out train times to tourists, the Promettes were also used as hostesses and guides for foreign guests. One of the highlights of her summer was meeting pop star Frankie Vaughan at the Hippodrome. Hazel Legg, 85, from Southwick, West Sussex, was chief Promette in 1956 and 1957. She said: 'It wasn’t hard work, it was pleasurable. We used to get a lot of queries, it was really quite something. 'People would ask us all sorts of things, like what's on at the cinema and we would be up to date with everything that was going on. 'We would also get silly sorts of things like how many pebbles on the beach or what we were doing that night. It is a brilliant idea and just a pity it has not been brought back sooner.' The new volunteer scheme is part of a major shake-up of tourist information in Brighton. The new recruits will be stationed at key locations throughout the city including the Royal Pavilion, the train station, and along the seafront. VisitBrighton said it is looking to 'harness some of London 2012’s sporting spirit' by introducing its own band of on-street volunteers. Recruits will need to commit to a minimum of six months, cover a variety of shifts including weekends, and be able to work for four hours at a time. In return, they will develop new skills with ongoing training, and at the end of their six-month stint will be given a certificate of recognition for their work. Other benefits include free admission to some of the city’s main tourism attractions and invitations to tourism-related openings and events. The Promettes, who operated out of a caravan at weekends, were on hand to give directions, offer medical advice, or just to cheer up visitors . Geoffrey Bowden, chairman of the council’s economic development and culture committee, said: . 'This is a great opportunity for people to get involved and share their passion for the city with visitors. 'The scheme runs successfully in other cities around the world and worked brilliantly in London during the 2012 Olympics. 'The role of the London Gamesmakers during the London Olympics shows how valuable volunteers can be. The volunteers will have the important role of welcoming visitors and responding to their enquiries.' Late comedian Harry Secombe looks rather pleased to pose between two Promettes. The new volunteers will include men for the first time . However unions raised concerns about the use of unpaid volunteers to step in where previously skilled members at the now defunct Visitor Information Centre,  next to the Royal Pavilion, that was closed in September to save money. Alex Knutsen, of Brighton and Hove Unison, said: 'We do have concerns about people doing this on a voluntary basis with no real recompense. 'We wouldn’t want to run down volunteering but it’s better to have skilled paid people with good knowledge of what’s available in the city for all the millions of visitors we have each year. 'With most of that information centre team going, it is a case of cutting off our noses to spite our face. 'We would have preferred to see if the people who benefit from the service, such as hotels, could be asked whether they would contribute to the costs of the centre.'

Although the site was illegally padlocked, a council officer was able to access the field and unwrap the barbed wire. RSPCA officials were informed about the site and notices have been served on the horsesâ€™ owner to remove the animals. Locked up: The five horses and a pony have been locked up illegally on a small patch of grass on a council estate in Low Simonside, near Jarrow. The owner has refused to move them despite an order from the council . Shocking sight: Alan Bartlett, 66, whose home overlooks the site, said: 'It's absolutely disgusting and a disgrace that a horse should be left like that' A South Tyneside Council spokesman, said a number of its departments are working collectively to swiftly resolve the situation. 'The council has served a notice to the animalsâ€™ owner asking them to remove the horses from the site. 'Despite assurances that they would be removed at the start of this week, they remain on the land. 'The council is concerned both at the unauthorised occupation of the land, and the environment in which the animals are being left. The RSPCA have also attended the site with a view to assessing the condition of the animals. 'Should the owner not comply with our requests, there may be no other option but to bring in the services of an enforcement company to take control of the animals. 'Tethering horses on council land is not permitted, as this action can cause danger to the public and can adversely affect the welfare of the horses themselves, as well as cause damage to the land. 'The council will not tolerate this, and will continue to take necessary action against irresponsible horse owners.'","A group of horses were found tethered on a South Tyneside council estate .

Thrifty elderly Britons are putting their lives at risk by refusing to throw out food, experts have warned. Older people are more likely to ignore use-by dates on food because they don’t want to waste it. But this puts them at risk of the deadly Listeria bug which can grow in fridges and kills more people than E coli or Salmonella, scientists say. Older people are more likely to ignore use-by dates on food because they don¿t want to waste it . The warning follows a surge in cases of Listeria food poisoning among elderly Britons. With the number of cases in the over-60s trebling in a decade, the age group now accounts for two-thirds of the 200 or so cases in the UK a year. Although relatively rare, Listeria, which thrives in chilled pre-packed foods such as cold meats, sandwiches, pate and soft cheeses, can be fatal. Almost all of those who catch the bug are admitted to hospital and up to 40 per cent die. A Society for Applied Microbiology conference heard yesterday (WEDS) that the elderly’s fear of wasting food and love of bulk buying bargains may help explain why they account for so many of the cases. Plus, research has shown that pensioners are the biggest buyers of the vacuum packed ready-to-eat foods that Listeria loves to lurk in. Almost all of those who catch the bug are admitted to hospital and up to 40 per cent die . Ellen Evans, a chef turned food safety researcher, said that many ignore use by dates, which are calculated based on how quickly bacteria multiply to dangerous levels. She said: ‘A lot of people have lived through rationing and they don’t want to waste food. ‘They can’t see how a food won’t make them ill today but isn’t safe tomorrow. ‘They think, “What’s the worst that can happen?  I’ll take a chance.”’ Miss Evans, a PhD student at Cardiff Metropolitan University, interviewed 100 over 60s, watched them prepare food and checked the contents of their fridges. Some 72 per cent said that they knew the importance of use by dates but 66 per cent said they didn’t like them and 57 per cent didn’t follow them. A check of their fridges found that almost half of sell by dates had expired – meaning the foods could contain dangerous levels of bacteria. Miss Evans said: ‘Some things were just a few days old but some were a week or ten days past the use by date. ‘They may have smelt and tasted OK but that is not a reliable way of seeing of something is safe to eat.’ The kitchen inspection also found that most of that the temperature in most fridges was above the recommended 5c. Slightly warmer temperatures favour the growth of Listeria, which also breeds quickly after packets of contaminated foods are opened. The weakening of the immune system that occurs with age could also help explain why the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the bug. Professor Hugh Pennington, one of Britain’s leading microbiologists, advises buying a fridge thermometer – and treating food labels with as much respect as those on medicines. He said: ‘The most important thing is to read the label. ‘It is something worth paying attention to. Listeria really is quite a nasty infection, at any age.’","Older people are more likely to ignore use-by dates on food because they don’t want to waste it .

Miners' leader Arthur Scargill was accused of hypocrisy last night after it emerged he tried to buy his London council flat by exploiting one of Margaret Thatcher’s flagship policies. The former National Union of Mineworkers president applied for the £1million property at a knock-down price in 1993 under the Right To Buy scheme. But the Left-winger was turned down because the Barbican flat was not his primary residence. Former miners' union boss Arthur Scargill faces criticism over the revelation that he tried to use the flagship Right to Buy laws of his bitter rival . Mr Scargill, who led the doomed . miners’ strike against the Thatcher government’s pit closures in 1984, . failed to mention in the paperwork that he did not pay the rent – the . NUM paid £34,000 a year to the Corporation of London for it. The . revelations, in a BBC1 Inside Out documentary, follow a court case last . year in which the 76-year-old firebrand lost the right to stay in the . flat for life at the union’s expense. During the hearing it emerged that from 1991 to 2008 the NUM’s executive committee did not know it was paying the rent. Mr Scargill, who has been shunned by many former allies as a result of . the legal battle over his perks, told the BBC that had he succeeded in . buying the council flat – at a potential discount of up to 50 per cent – . he would have transferred its ownership to the union. But . NUM general secretary Chris Kitchen rejected this explanation. He said . he was shocked by Mr Scargill’s attempt to ‘feather his nest’ and said . that members had been betrayed by their former leader. ‘I . can’t believe that the man I now know as Arthur Scargill would have . given away a million-pound flat,’ he said, adding that Mr Scargill had . misled the union into paying for the flat in the first place and had no . right to it in his contract. The embarrassing revelation emerged in legal papers relating to the court battle last year which saw Mr Scargill lose the right to live rent free in the flat in Barbican's Shakespeare Tower . Tory . Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said of the revelations: ‘The . revolution may be complete if Arthur Scargill wants to take up the Right . To Buy.’ The bitter dispute between the Conservative government and the miners was triggered in March 1984 by plans to close 20 loss-making pits. Mr Scargill went into battle with the Tories and a year-long war of attrition ensued. This month it emerged Mrs Thatcher planned to mobilise hundreds of troops and considered declaring a state of emergency at the height of the 1984 strike. Another option was to switch to a three-day working week after ministers warned her that the lights could go out in Britain, according to the National Archives. A secret plan was hatched by the Thatcher government to stop union leaders smuggling suitcases of Soviet cash in Britain. But it has now emerged that Mr Scargill tried to takje advantage of one of the flagship policies of his old foe. Right to Buy, introduced in 1980, was at first criticised for reducing housing stock but it allowed millions to own a home for the first time and increased social mobility. It allowed tenants to buy a council-owned property with a discount of up to 50 per cent on its market value. Mr Scargill's application emerged in legal papers relating to last year’s court case in which Mr Scargill lost the right to stay in his London flat for life at the expense of the NUM. NUM general secretary Chris Kitchen told the BBC: ‘The fact that Scargill tried to use Thatcher's right-to-buy scheme is bad enough, but there is no evidence it would have been signed over to the NUM for the benefit of the members.’ Rival: Margaret Thatcher considered calling in the army in a bid to defeat the miners' strike in 1984 . Former Scargill loyalist Jimmy Kelly, a miner at the Edlington Main pit near Doncaster in the 1980s, added: ‘It's so hypocritical it's unreal. It was Thatcher's legislation, actually giving council tenants the right to buy their own houses. ‘I think if it had been made public before then there'd have been a huge outcry. I think people would be astounded by knowing that.’ When Baroness Thatcher dies last year, Mr Scargill did not comment publicly. But it emerged he expressed his delight via text message. Ken Capstick, treasurer of the Socialist Labour Party which Arthur Scargill leads, sent the former union boss a text message on Monday reading: ‘Thatcher Dead’. Mr Scargill replied almost instantly: ‘Scargill Alive!’","Ex-National Union of Miners leader tried to buy Barbican flat in 1993 .

Challenge: Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey has repeatedly called for industrial action . The Unite union has built a £30 million war chest to bankroll strikes in the run-up to the next election. Leaked internal documents reveal that it has poured an extra £5 million into the fund in the last 18 months alone – seemingly paying lip service to the idea of settling disputes without industrial action. Minutes from its board meeting last month also show that Unite – Labour’s biggest donor – is stepping up pressure on party leader Ed Miliband to relax strike laws introduced in the wake of the industrial chaos of the 1970s. The disclosures are an embarrassment for Mr Miliband, who is attempting to curb the power of the unions and reassure business that a future Labour government would not be in their thrall in the wake of the Falkirk vote-rigging scandal. An internal report by Unite’s finance director reveals that the union poured an extra £2.7 million into its strike fund in the first nine months of last year, despite spending just £200,000 on strike pay. Unite revealed in 2012 that it was creating a £25 million dispute fund to prevent employers from ‘starving workers into submission’. But the speed at which it has expanded the kitty will lead to fears about its intentions in the run-up to the election. General secretary Len McCluskey has repeatedly called for industrial action in protest at the Government’s austerity programme. He has said he sees ‘disputes unfolding all over the place’, claiming the union needs financial clout to ‘fight back’. Unite has also said it needs the resources to demonstrate to employers that it ‘means business’ when it orders a walkout, allowing it to provide £30 a day in strike pay for workers involved in disputes. Most controversially, the cash is also used to fund Unite’s sinister ‘leverage tactics’, which sparked controversy last year when it sent mobs of protesters to demonstrate outside the homes of directors of the Grangemouth oil refinery. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'We need security, not strikes... Unless Ed Miliband gets his biggest union paymaster to act responsibly, it will be clear he's too weak to stand up for hard-working people' In the documents, Unite’s political director Jenny Formby welcomed Mr Miliband’s clear shift to the Left, but warned that ‘significant work’ was still needed to tackle current strike policies and to build positive trade union ‘rights and freedoms’. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps last night condemned the apparent bid by Unite to ready itself for a wave of strikes. ‘We need security, not strikes,’ he said. ‘Unless Ed Miliband gets his biggest union paymaster to act responsibly, it will be clear he’s too weak to stand up for hard-working people.’ Tory MP David Morris, deputy chairman of the Campaign for Trade Union Reform, said Unite should stop its ‘highly political’ activity. The revelations come as Mr Miliband prepares to make a major climbdown following Unite’s refusal to accept reforms to curb the power of the unions. Proposals to end the controversial system in which many union members are automatically signed up as Labour ‘affiliates’ have now been delayed for at least five years. A ‘special conference’ planned for March will now last just two hours. Unite last night insisted the expansion of the strike fund did not mean it was planning a fresh wave of industrial action. A spokesman said: ‘Nine times out of ten disputes are resolved and industrial action avoided through negotiation with sensible employers. The dispute fund is there to cover things such as legal costs and support for members on those rare occasions when industrial action does occur.’","Leaked documents show union has poured in £5 million in just 18 months .

Europe must take the axe to its bloated benefits bill, which now accounts for half of all welfare spending on the planet, George Osborne warned today. The Chancellor delivered a blunt message to other EU leaders, telling them: ‘We can’t go on like this.’ Mr Osborne raised the prospect of Britain leaving the EU altogether if the 28-nation bloc fails to undertake fundamental reforms. Warning: George Osborne said other EU countries must reform if they do not want Britain to leave . Mr Osborne use a speech at an Open Europe event to warn Brussels must improve competitiveness, create jobs and protect the rights of countries which are not in the single currency . He said Brussels must improve competitiveness, create jobs and protect the rights of countries which are not in the single currency. The Tory leadership has been under growing pressure in recent months to make it clear they would be willing to campaign for a British exit from the EU if other countries refuse to hand back significant powers. Last year, David Cameron promised that if he remains in Downing Street after the next election he will seek to renegotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship with the EU before holding an in/out referendum on membership by 2017. Ministers believe that as burgeoning economic recovery puts Britain at the top of the EU’s growth league, its influence in demanding reforms is rising. Mr Osborne issued a stark warning about the consequences of the EU failing to cut back on bloated welfare spending . Mr Osborne, speaking today at a conference on EU reform hosted by the Open Europe think-tank and the Fresh Start group of Tory MPs seeking a new relationship with a reformed EU, indicated he favours remaining in a reformed union. But he issued a stark warning about the consequences of a failure of the EU to introduce more flexibility in the labour market and cut back on bloated welfare spending. Brussels must not put the UK in a position where it has to choose between joining the single currency to protect its interests or leaving the EU, Mr Osborne added. The EU accounts for 7 per cent of the world's population, 25 per cent of its economy but 50 per cent of all welfare spending. Mr Osborne said the European economy has 'stalled' with one in four young people out of work and the number of investions halving in a decade. The Chancellor suggested the British people would turn their backs on the EU unless other countries agreed to reform.’ The biggest economic risk facing Europe comes from ‘a failure to reform and renegotiate’, he said. ‘It is the status quo which condemns . the people of Europe to an ongoing economic crisis and continuing . decline. And so there is a simple choice for Europe: reform or decline.’ Mr Osborne said it was . already clear that Europe faced a ‘competitiveness problem’ before the . financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. ‘But . the crisis has dramatically accelerated the shifts in the tectonic . economic plates that see power moving eastwards and southwards,’ he . added. Booming: India's economy is set to outstrip that of the UK before 2030 and overtake much of Europe . ‘Over the last six years, the European economy has stalled. In the same period, the Indian economy has grown by a third, the Chinese economy by 50 per cent. Over the next 15 years Europe’s share of global output is forecast to halve. Make no mistake, our continent is falling behind. ‘Look at innovation, where Europe’s share of world patent applications nearly halved in the last decade. Look at unemployment, where a quarter of young people looking for work can’t find it. Look at welfare. ‘As Angela Merkel has pointed out, Europe accounts for just over seven per cent of the world’s population, 25 per cent of its economy, and 50 per cent of global social welfare spending. We can’t go on like this.’ Andrea Leadsom of the Fresh Start group said if Britain voted to leave the EU, negotiations would be ‘more fruitful’ than before the referendum.","Chancellor says the European Union must reform or Britain could leave .

The sad decline of Steven Finn reached a new low on Wednesday when, astonishingly, he became the third member of England’s Ashes squad to fail to see out the torturous tour of Australia. Finn, among the leading fast bowlers in the world less than a year ago, joins Jonathan Trott and Graeme Swann in leaving early after being sent home almost as  a compassionate move when he simply became ‘unpickable’. Such has been the collapse of Finn’s action and confidence that he has not been trusted in a single international match, even though England used a record 18 players in the Ashes. Enough is clearly enough. 'Unpickable': Fast bowler Steven Finn has been sent home from England's tour of Australia . Signing up: Finn, meeting a young fan, has not been trusted to make a single outing on this tour . He will return to Middlesex to start . again, as first revealed by Mail Online Sport, with Ashley Giles, . England’s one-day coach, admitting that Finn had been named in the . provisional 30-man squad for the World Twenty20 in March ‘more in hope . than expectation’. The premature departure of Finn, with four . one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches left against . Australia, is perhaps the biggest blow yet for England because, at 24, . he is so important to their rebuilding plans for a ‘new era’. ‘We . feel this is the best thing for Steven,’ said Giles after his . beleaguered team arrived in Brisbane ahead of tomorrow’s second  50-over . game against Australia. Fall from grace: Finn was seen as one of the best fast bowlers in the world less than a year ago . His problems began with his habit of knocking the bails off with his right knee in delivery stride, which led to a change in cricket’s laws to make it a new ball, and then he experimented with a shorter run up before going back to his original longer version. Now he just seems to have lost it altogether. ‘Sometimes through your career you go through these ups and downs and his timing’s out and that can affect your confidence,’ said Giles. ‘And it’s not coming out as quickly as he’d like either. He’s been in this state for at least a couple of months and it hasn’t worked so we feel it’s best to take him out of this. Sometimes you have to do that. At the moment he needs a bit of space and in the short term a couple of weeks away from cricket full stop.’ There is a theory that suggests Finn’s problems stem from conflicting advice from his coaches at Middlesex, Angus Fraser and Richard Johnson, and that he is receiving from England’s David Saker and Kevin Shine. Ultimately, though, Finn has to sort things out for himself. Decision: England one-day coach Ashley Giles says he wants Finn back as quickly as possible . ‘He’s not been bowling well enough to be . selected and we feel the best place for him right now is to be out of . that performance environment. We’re taking part in  the most difficult . tour, along  with India, and Steven’s just not pickable at the moment. ‘So . he will go back and work on the technical things he has to sort out. We’ve already had communication with Middlesex and we need to come up . with a plan to get him back as quickly as we can.’ It is by any . standards a remarkable collapse for Finn, who was taking the new ball . ahead of Stuart Broad as recently as the first Test against New Zealand . in Dunedin last year and was almost unplayable in the one-dayers on that . tour. His problems began with his habit of knocking the bails off . with his right knee in delivery stride, which led to a change in . cricket’s laws to make it a no-ball, and then he experimented with a . shorter run up before going back to his original longer version. Now he . seems to have lost it altogether. Back home: Graeme Swann and Jonathan Trott have both returned to England earlier than planned . Giles said: ‘Sometimes through your . career you go through these ups and downs and his timing’s out and that . can affect his confidence. And it’s not coming out as quickly as he’d . like either. 'He’s been in this state for at least a couple of months and . it hasn’t worked so we feel it’s best to take him out of this. Sometimes you have to do that.

England’s David Saker and Kevin Shine. STEVE HARMISON: . The best bowler in the world in 2004 was key to the 2005 Ashes victory . but struggled on the next tour — serving up a memorably wild wide first . ball at Brisbane. PHIL TUFNELL: . The spinner played the first four Tests in 1994-95 but, suffering with . personal issues, trashed his hotel room in Perth and was taken to a . psychiatric ward. SAJID MAHMOOD: Impressed in his debut Test summer of 2006 but was inaccurate that winter and has not played a Test since Sydney 2007. But here’s what can be done… . MITCHELL JOHNSON: . The rapid leftie, whose lack of control made him a laughing stock, was . dropped last March but recalled in time for the visit of England. The . rest is history… . ‘Whichever coach has been . working with him, whether that’s at Middlesex or England, has only got . the best interests of Steven Finn at heart,’ insisted Giles. ‘There is . no squabbling over the sort of care he is getting. We just need to get . him bowling again the way he can. ‘It’s not that long ago he was bowling close to his best in New Zealand where he was the spearhead of our one-day attack. ‘He’s . a really key asset going  forward. In such a big business you would . call him a million pound asset and when you’ve got assets like that you . need to look after them. For now that means going home and sorting . himself out.’ The ‘yips’ is a condition more associated in cricket . with left-arm spinners than fast bowlers but could Finn’s problems be a . case of them? ‘I hate that word and I don’t even want to say it,’ said . Giles, a left-arm spinner himself. ‘That’s a very different thing from . what I believe Steven has got. The important thing is that he doesn’t . want anyone to think he’s  quitting. No-one would dream of saying that. 'We made this decision in conjunction with the guys back home. All the . top bosses have been involved in this. The most important thing now, . from our perspective and Middlesex’s, is that we move forward together.’ Giles was speaking in the same Brisbane hotel where England dropped . the bombshell that  Trott was going home with a stress-related . condition after the first Test. It seems a long time ago now but the . problems keep on coming for England and there are still seven matches . on this tour to come. They will take place, as the previous six have, . without Steven Finn.","Finn has been sent back to Middlesex to work on bowling technique .

Cancer: Peter Redfern has admitted killing his wife and daughter after reacting badly to cancer drugs, a court has heard . A retired gas fitter dying from cancer strangled his wife and bludgeoned his daughter with a hammer after reacting badly to cancer treatment, a court heard. Peter Redfern, 70, had lived an exemplary and quiet family life with his wife Jean, 67, and Sarah, 33, at their bungalow home in Wath upon Dearne, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire. But after he was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer he was put on chemotherapy with a combination of drugs including corticosteroids which can lead to 'drug-induced adverse psychiatric events'. His barrister Mark George QC told Sheffield Crown Court: 'He was a man who would never have acted in the way he did had it not been for the reaction of the taking of these powerful drugs.' Redfern admitted the manslaughter of his wife on the grounds of diminished responsibility and the murder of his daughter on July 22 last year. After killing his wife in the bedroom he lay in wait for his daughter as she came in from work and bludgeoned her to death with a hammer in the kitchen so she could not see her motherâ€™s body. Redfern wept in the dock and held his head down as the facts of the tragedy unfolded. Graham Reeds QC, prosecuting, said Redfern had been diagnosed with incurable cancer and it was recognised that using corticosteroids in a small number of cases could lead to 'drug-induced adverse psychiatric events'. Medical experts had concluded that the pensioner fell into the one per cent of the population who would suffer adversely from such treatment and it was likely to have been reponsible for his behaviour on the day. Peter Redfern, 70, had lived an exemplary and quiet family life with his wife Jean, 67, and Sarah, 33, at their bungalow home in Wath upon Dearne, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, before the incident last year . He was also suffering from depression and the taking of the Dexamethasone corticosteroids in combination with other drugs 'may explain his conduct in carrying out the killings,' said Mr Reeds. The couple married in November, 1968, and met when both worked for British Gas in Rotherham before Sarah was born in 1980. Mr Reeds said: 'They were to all intents a reserved and close-knit family who tended to socialise together rather than with outsiders.' The family took holidays and day trips together and Mrs Redfern regarded Sarah as her best friend . But in May last year Redfern was told he had incurable bone marrow cancer which is life-threatening and will limit his lifespan. He was offered chemotherapy and opted to enter a national trial for its treatment with different combinations of recognised drugs to see which was the most efficient in treating the disease. Crime scene: Redfern admitted the manslaughter of his wife on the grounds of diminished responsibility and the murder of his daughter on July 22 last year . His trial started on June 3 but he stopped it on July 4 after suffering unpleasant side effects. He started a different trial on July 11 with other drugs but again asked for it to be stopped after just five days. On July 22, the day of the tragedy, a nurse rang him at home and offered him a clinic appointment to see how they should proceed. Later that day Redfern rang 999 to say: 'I have just killed my wife and daughter.' 'He was a man who would never have acted . in the way he did had it not been for the reaction of the taking of . these powerful drugs' - Mark George QC . Police officers found Mrs Redfern dead in he bedroom and Sarah in the kitchen. 'Each woman was found with a plastic bag over her head secured with white elecrical flex wrapped around the neck,' said Mr Reeds. Mr Redfern had strangled his wife first with the flex and repeatedly hit Sarah with a hammer when she returned home. When arrested he behaved 'oddly' at the police station but did not appear to be mentally ill and later told a nurse he was 'feeling depressed and anxious and was worrying about his future'. Mr Reeds said: 'He said that when he realised what he had done to Sarahâ€™s mother he decided he could not leave Sarah to see it and he decided to kill her.' Mark George, for Redfern said: 'This is a truly tragic case. Less than a year ago having been retired for more than 15 years his life seemed to be a very pleasant one. All in the family seemed completely normal. All of this has come as the most appalling devastating blow to everybody involved in the case.' He said Mr Redfern ran to keep himself fit but developed back problems and during tests for that he was diagnosed with incurable bone marrow cancer. Tragedy: Police officers found Mrs Redfern dead in the bedroom and Sarah in the kitchen . He told the nurse who contacted him on the day of the tragedy that he was suffering with sleeplessness, loss of appetite, he felt he was losing weight and was 'feeling jittery'. Police officers who went to the house described him as 'agitated and pacing around' outside the house. He had never been able to explain to anyone why he had killed Mrs Redfern. Mr George said: 'But he has always maintained that the only thing he could think was that it was linked to the treatment he had for cancer. He had absolutely no motive to wish to harm Jean in any way. He acted without any pre-meditation or thought entirely on the spur of the moment.' He went on: 'He had led an entirely blameless life. It is hard to get away from the feeling that in some way there was something about the effect on him of the treatment for cancer which precipitated this catastrophic chain of events.' Mr George concluded: 'He knows there is no other alternative than he will die in prison.' The judge Mr Justice Stephen Males was due to sentence Redfern tomorrow.","Peter Redfern lived an 'exemplary life' with wife Jean and daughter Sarah .

The reluctance of the UK authorities to sanction the hacking of phone calls and other communication involving Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, has led to a rift which has compromised the inquiry. Revelations about the dispute came as the French prosecutor co-ordinating the investigation, launched his most outspoken attack yet on Mr Al-Hilli, who denies any involvement. Making it abundantly clear he still considers the accountant to have been involved in the crime - despite the paucity of evidence against him - prosecutor Eric Maillaud said Mr Al-Hilli was driven by ‘a feeling of hate and vengeance’. Mr Al-Hilli has, in turn, accused Mr Maillaud of displaying racism towards him because of his Iraqi Muslim background, claiming he is trying to frame him to protect a French killer with influential connections. It was Mr Maillaud and his colleagues who, more than a year ago, first urged the British to monitor all of Mr Al-Hilli’s telephone and computer communication. They were convinced he played a part in the murder of his brother Saad, 50, on a remote road in the Alps in September, 2012. Saad was gunned down along with his wife Ikbal, 47, and his mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74. French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was also murdered in the ambush close to Lake Annecy. The Al-Hillis’ seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, was shot in the shoulder while her sister Zeena, four, hid underneath her mother’s skirt in the back of the family’s BMW. Denail: Zaid Al-Hilli denies any involvement in his brother's death . Zaid Al-Hilli was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder in January and is currently on police bail. One of the reasons the British finally agreed to arrest him was because  of an alleged series of phone calls to Romania. ‘There has been no movement on this side of the inquiry at all,’ a senior investigating source based outside of the UK told The Mail on Sunday. ‘Things could have been very different if we had been able to tap the suspect early on, and possibly catch him out.’ Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, British police and security services need a warrant, signed by the Home Secretary, before they can initiate a phone tap. Mystery: The scene of the killing in the Alps last year, which was believed to target the al-Hilli family . Restrictions on hacking are less stringent in France and Mr Maillaud has always made it clear that he wanted to see Mr Al-Hilli, who lives in Chessington, Surrey, arrested as soon as possible. He said: ‘If Zaid Al-Hilli was living in France he would have been interrogated and probably taken into custody because that’s a technique we use.’ In his latest interview on Friday, Mr Maillaud revived the theory that Zaid was involved in a bitter dispute with Saad over their father’s will. Referring to Zaid Al-Hilli, Mr Maillaud . said: ‘It’s true that he presents an interesting profile as he is . animated by a feeling of hate and vengeance.’ Road: Mr Mollier and the al-Hillis were killed by an unknown assassin near Lake Annecy . Zaid is convinced that cyclist Mr Mollier was the real target of the killer – but Mr Maillaud refuses to contemplate that possibility, insisting that Mr Mollier was merely an unlucky passer-by. None of the forces involved in the investigation – which include both Surrey and the Metropolitan Police – would discuss the bugging claims, or tensions between officers, because of ‘operational reasons’. There were more claims about the Al-Hillis released by French prosecutors last week. They said Saad Al-Hilli had a ‘heated’ argument with an unidentified person at the campsite where the family were staying the night before he was killed. Next week, E-fit images of a motorcyclist and the driver of a BMW seen at the time of the killings will be released by the French. They are based on descriptions provided by local forestry workers.","Saad Al-Hilli and his family were attacked by a gunman last year .

It looks like the definition of paradise, high in the sky, surrounded by luscious green branches, with the sun glowing softly and nothing but clear blue water down beneath. But clad in nothing but a pair of Speedos, faced with a 27-metre tumble from a crumbling cliff, many would think twice about that. Not these men. Paradise: Phi Phi Island in southern Thailand has hosted the final round of the sixth annual cliff diving championship, where the men have just three seconds to perform . Eagerly bounding to the cliff-edge on Phi Phi Island in Thailand, 14 divers flung themselves, twisting and turning at break neck speed towards life-threatening rocks. Their one shared objective: make it look good. Gathered for the sixth round of the sixth annual Red Bull cliff diving championship series today, they have all spent months preparing their moves. Death-defying: Alain Kohl (left) of Luxembourg diving off the Viking Caves on the island. Artem Silchenko (right) is mid-twist as he falls towards the Andaman Sea . There is no hard-and-fast rule for the game - just the mantra, 'power and balance'. But with just three seconds between leaving the podium and hitting the Andaman Sea, they don't have long to show off their best. This year the series has taken the competitors all over the world. Warriors: The sport was created as a challenge for Hawaiian warriors to demonstrate their loyalty to King Kahekili. Here Michal Navratil of the Czech Republic faces the clear water . Frightening: David Colturi of the USA dives from the 27-metre platform. There seem to be no qualms about the surrounding boats as the men tumble in nothing but Speedos . The season started in France's La Rochelle, followed by Copenhagen, and then Azores in Portugal. From there they went on to Italy, Boston, Pembrokeshire, before reaching the southern coast of Thailand for the final. Unfortunately, the penultimate stop scheduled for Brazil earlier this month had to be cancelled due to bad weather. Russia's Artem Silchenko won the day's competition - but it wasn't enough to take the overall title from Britain's Gary Hunt, who has held the top spot since 2010.

Turn: Michal Navratil of the Czech Republic (left) and Steven LoBue of the USA (right) battle it out for the title with mind-blogging contortions . Worldwide: Before Thailand, the group competed in the beauty spots of France, Italy, Wales, Brazil, Copenhagen, Portugal, and Boston . Winning leap: Artem Silchenko of Russia prepares to launch an armstand dive from the 27-metre platform in the Andaman Sea during the last competition day of the eighth and final stop of the 2013 Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series . Third place overall: Orlando Duque of Colombia takes the plunge. The main rule that divers must adhere to is 'power and balance' as they fall towards the water below . Going into today's final, former Olympic hopeful Hunt, 29, who has won a number of medals at the Great Britain National Diving championships, was already the tournament leader. Silchenko stood in second place and 10-time world champion Orlando Duque, from Colombia, was in third. Mexico's Jonathan Paredes holds fifth, ahead of David Colturi, from the US. Professional rivals: The two potential series winners, Artem Silchenko (left) of Russia and Gary Hunt (right) of the UK pose for a portrait on the beach before competing . The final moments: Silchenko's land. The land is the most crucial part of the fall - to maintain the style they have worked tirelessly to hone, and to ensure they don't injure themselves . Relax: Finally Artem Silchenko of Russia can celebrate after his final dive during the last competition day of this year's season. He could not take the top spot but won the day's contest . Champion: Silchenko stands on the podium as the other divers spray him with champagne and fans wave flags, lauding his success . Best seats: Crowds crammed onto boats to get the best view of divers - such as winner Silchenko (pictured centre) - performing their finale . Proud: Local media in Thailand described the event - the first one to be hosted by Krabi - as a very proud moment for the nation. Crowds gathered to hail Silchenko, the winner . Runners up: Steven LoBue (right) of the US took second place for the day and third place went to Orlando Duque (left) of Colombia . The sport started in the late 1700s as an initiation for Hawaiian warriors - as ordered by King Kahekili, who was obsessed by cliff diving. He challenged his people to prove their loyalty by throwing themselves hundreds of feet into rocky water. It is from that moment in time that the sport earned its mantra: 'mana and pona' - 'power and balance' in Hawaiian. Now a global phenomenon, local Thai media has described the event - the first time it has been hosted by Krabi - as a very special moment for the nation.","14 cliff divers gathered in Phi Phi Island, southern Thailand, for the sixth annual Red Bull world champion series .

Last month we revealed that Spencer Matthews was training for next month’s New York Marathon – now his co-star Binky Felstead has started an intensive new regime and  is working out seven days a week. The pretty brunette, is now a regular at the upmarket Equinox Gym in Kensington, West London, where she has signed up for a one-hour class called The Workx. Re-made in Chelsea: Binky Felstead have chosen to join a new gym to sculpture her body . It involves running on a treadmill, followed by dumbbell exercises and those aimed at improving core strength. The 24-year-old has also been spotted lifting weights with a personal trainer. Let’s hope that  the men of SW3 don’t get on  Binky’s wrong side. The secret to beating symptoms of the menopause could be all in the mind. In . a new book, Myra Hunter, professor of health psychology at King’s . College London, argues that negative perceptions about the menopause can . mean that women panic and become flustered when  they have a hot flush, . making the symptoms much worse. But . cognitive behavioural therapy – a type of counselling that works by . replacing  negative thoughts with positive ones – can help to change . this thought process, enabling women to better manage and reduce the . condition,  says Prof Hunter. Fit for fight: Workout machine designer Alan Shearer on the pitch . Former England and Newcastle United  striker Alan Shearer has his sights set on a business idea aimed at solving the nation’s obesity epidemic. Alan has developed a new fitness workout machine called the Speedflex with former Newcastle physio Paul Ferris and businessman Graham Wylie. The high-tech machines respond to an individual’s force as opposed to the amount of weights you add to them. So if you push or pull the overhead bar harder, it will resist your body weight and force you to exert yourself more. This means that unfit people can take classes alongside professionals as each machine works to the individual’s ability. Classes will take place in Speedflex centres, which are being rolled out across the UK. Cheating and getting away  with it feels great, says a new study from the University of Washington. Research . published by the American Psychological Association found that the . assumption that people feel remorse from cheating is false. Many people actually feel good  – even describing it as a natural high – as long as they’re not hurting anyone. The . study looked at 1,000 people in their late 20s and 30s  in the US and . England. Just over half of those participating were men. The . volunteers were given mathematical and word-puzzle tests, some of which . were virtually impossible –  such as determining that the letters . ‘unaagt’ were an anagram for taguan, a species  of flying squirrel. Previous testing had shown  that the likelihood of solving the problems . correctly was minuscule. Participants . were also handed the answers to the problems during the test but were . told  ‘not to look at them’, thereby allowing them to cheat. Half . the participants got the question right – meaning a high proportion . must have cheated, claim the researchers – and all said they felt good . about it. ‘Showing people . experience positive emotions when cheating is a novel finding,’ says Dr . Daniel Frings, senior lecturer in psychology at London South Bank . University. ‘Unfortunately,  it chimes with other research showing that . when faced with dilemmas, people don’t always behave in ways beneficial . to society,’ he says.","MIC star Binky joins hot American gym in Kensington to tone up .

A father-to-be has spoken of his desperate desire to meet his unborn daughter before he dies from cancer. Jared Noel is battling advanced bowel cancer that has spread to his liver and his lungs. The 32-year-old doctor, from Auckland, New Zealand, was diagnosed with the disease in 2008. Jared Noel (with wife, Hannah) is battling advanced bowel cancer that has spread to his liver and his lungs. The 32-year-old doctor, from New Zealand, was diagnosed with the disease in 2008. He is now desperately hoping to live long enough to meet his unborn daughter, due in January . Since then, he has undergone a gruelling 66 rounds of chemotherapy and major surgery twice, the New Zealand Herald reported. Even though his prognosis was bleak, Dr Noel and his wife Hannah decided to try for a baby - hoping he would live long enough to meet the child and spend some time with him or her. After four rounds of IVF, they succeeded, and their daughter is due on January 21. But they have now been given the devasting news that Dr Noel's cancer has spread - and he has just months to live. Thanks to a huge online fundraising effort in New Zealand, he has managed to raise the $60,000 NZD (£30,700) to pay for ten courses of medicine to prolong his life - enough, he hopes, to meet his daughter. Since being diagnosed, Dr Noel has undergone a gruelling 66 rounds of chemotherapy and major surgery twice. But he has now been given just months to live . In a heartbreaking post on his blog, he wrote: 'More recently, the joys of Hannah’s pregnancy has dominated our life. 'Setting . up the baby room, feeling the kicks of our daughter, and choosing her . name has been such a great experience, one that has become even more . amazing when juxtaposed against our circumstance and the finite lifespan . I have…. 'I had a CT scan . on Monday, and the results from that have devastated us. I have rampant, . multiple new metastatic disease all throughout my liver, almost too . much to count. I have new disease in my mesentery and a new nodule in the right apex of my lung. 'This is the moment we have been dreading for 5 years and have been lucky to escape until now. 'This is where everything changes. I have a lifespan measured in months. 'Hannah . and I are gutted, the realisation that cancer is winning is like having . a knife hacked into the deepest part of our soul. 'The . disappointment is compounded by knowing we have a daughter waiting to . meet us, and for the first time, doubt has been cast over whether or not . I will make that meeting. 'This is aggressive cancer, doing its best to kill me, to rob our child of their father. We are devastated.' He added: 'My greatest hope is that I get to spend some time with her and enjoy fatherhood. She won't know me. She won't remember me. But I'd like to let her know how much I would have wanted to be there when she's 18, when she's 25.' Dr and Mrs Noel did not have the funds to pay for a life-prolonging drug, called Avastin. This slows the growth of tumours - hopefully prolonging his life long enough to meet his unborn daughter. The . drug is not paid for by the New Zealand agency which decides which . medicines and products are subsidised for use in the community and . public hospitals. Desperate for him to meet his daughter, the couple tried to raise $60,000 NZD (£30,700) to pay for ten courses of the medicine.

Desperate for him to meet his daughter, they tried to raise $60,000 NZD (£30,700) to pay for ten courses of the medicine. Thanks to an overwhelming response from well-wishers, they have now raised $154, 500 (around £80,000) Dr Noel said: 'If it wasn't for her [the baby], we would do our best and let nature take its course. 'But all of a sudden months and weeks are the difference between meeting my daughter or not and maybe the difference between me having a few months with her or not. 'It means a lot to Hannah, as she'll get to see me holding her. I'm doing it mainly for Hannah and my daughter now.' The fundraising response in the couple's home country has been staggering. Within seven hours of setting up a page on the site Givealittle, they had raised the $60,000. Avastin (also known as Bevacizumab) targets a protein that helps cancer cells develop a new blood supply. It blocks the protein and stops the cancer from developing new blood vessels. This reduces its supply of oxygen and nutrients so the tumour shrinks or stops growing. The drug is licensed to treat some types of cancer that have spread from where they first started (advanced or metastatic cancers). It may be used to treat an advanced type of lung cancer or advanced cancers of the bowel, breast or kidney. As of this morning, the page had raised $154, 500 (around £80,000), with many of the donations from anonymous donors. The site said it was the fastest fundraising response it had ever seen. Dr Noel will now begin the Avastin treatment and chemotherapy next week. He said the extra money raised would go towards giving his wife financial security and perhaps to a trust fund after he is gone. Writing on the fundraising page to express her gratitude, Mrs Noel said: 'The past 48 hours have  been a whirlwind of love, grace and generosity, demonstrating the enormous power of a story, relationships and social media to rally around a cause. 'Jared and I have been given more than we could ever have asked or imagined toward the cost of his treatment and the care of our baby. Our target long exceeded, we just want to thank everyone so very much for their kindness. 'To all those who gave, appealed and reposted on our behalf, often with words that brought tears to our eyes... Our hope is that we will have just a little while longer together and with our baby as a result of your generosity. 'Love your partner, hug your kids, spend time with your families, laugh and cry with your friends - for none of us know how long we have.'","Jared Noel has advanced bowel cancer that has spread to his liver and lungs .

"By . Alice Smellie . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 26 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 26 October 2013 . It's fitting that I am late for my first Alma SweatX treatment and have to run, so arrive perspiring profusely. The procedure – one of a new wave of devices that promise to stop sweating semi-permanently – was designed for those who suffer hyperhidrosis, the medical term for excessive sweating. It is the only non-surgical treatment to successfully tackle the smell of sweat. The condition is due to faulty nerve impulses sent to the sweat glands, and up to a million Britons are thought to have the problem. Feeling fresh: Reporter Alice Smellie relaxes as nurse Fiona Doherty applies the Alma SweatX device to her left armpit . Patients describe having to change clothes more than twice a day and are forced to rely on prescription-strength antiperspirants. Even these don’t always work. More long-term treatments to date have been painful and costly – involving surgery to sever the nerves or remove the glands. Botox injections are also offered, but these are said  to be very painful. Now there is an apparently pain-free option – and I have been invited to try it. Except that I don’t have hyperhidrosis. Alma SweatX is being aimed squarely at ‘the couture crowd’, who don’t want to ruin their designer frocks with sweat-mixed-with-deodorant stains. As a friend puts it: ‘The too posh to sweat.’ My excuse is that when your surname is Smellie, it is vital to be as fragrant as a daisy at all times. No sweat: The treatment targets those with such extreme perspiration that normal deodorants do not help . It costs £500 a pop (with up to four recommended). At a potential £2,000, that is a lot of Right Guard. But my friends are intrigued. To really test whether it works, I opt to have one armpit treated, and leave the other without deodorant for a week. But isn’t sweating something we are supposed to do? Well, yes. We are all sweating constantly. It cools us and removes waste from the body. We all have up to four million tiny sweat glands located in the skin. ‘There are two types of gland,’ says consultant endocrinologist Professor Ashley Grossman. Most prevalent are the eccrine glands, found 2mm to 6mm below the skin’s surface and dense around the soles of feet, palms of hands and forehead. The second type is the apocrine – 6mm to 8mm below the surface and found in the armpits and groin. These are activated at puberty. ‘Generalised sweat is controlled by the nervous system,’ says Prof Grossman. ‘Apocrine sweat is down to sex hormones.’ When a sweat gland is stimulated – by exercise, temperature or emotion – it secretes a fluid of water, sodium, chloride and potassium, which evaporates to cool the body. It’s possible to produce three litres of sweat an hour, but the average  is half a litre a day. The smell comes from proteins and fatty acids in apocrine sweat reacting with bacteria. These days, we’re all horrified by our natural smell. The UK deodorant market is worth more than £616 million. But most of us probably don’t smell as much as we believe. ‘I’m quite sure that lots of people don’t need to wear deodorant,’ says Prof Grossman. ‘Odour can be removed by showering. However, wetness can be embarrassing.’ The Alma SweatX emits electric and magnetic energy waves to target water molecules around the sweat glands, heating and deactivating them. As the nurse, Fiona Doherty, pushes the probes round my armpit, I occasionally feel a prickle of heat. Being extremely ticklish, I spend most of the time giggling. ‘It may take a few days to notice a difference,’ she says. The next day I dress with trepidation, skipping my Impulse spray. To my astonishment, nobody flinches on the school run. Sniffing your armpits while jogging is not good, but after five days there is a definite difference between the two in dampness and odour. I go to a ball, and in spite of dancing for two hours, not only is my left armpit almost completely dry, but  it is as fragrant as a flower. The right one is less lovely. A couple of friends I invite to ‘smell my new perfume’ agree there’s a vast difference between the two. At a regular medical check-up, when my GP asks me to hold up my right arm, a whiff of personal odour nearly fells the poor woman. I try to explain: ‘I’m not wearing deodorant on purpose, it’s my job.’ But this just makes me sound a bit insane. The treatment also works on the hands and feet and the effect lasts at least six months. Some women report results lasting more than a year. ‘As it’s in the preliminary stages, we won’t make claims about it lasting longer,’ says Fiona. But I’m very impressed. Now all I need is to get the other side zapped. SweatX from £500 per  treatment, courthouseclinics.com, 0845 555 5050 .","New treatment for sufferers of hyperhidrosis - excessive sweating .

High society hip-ster: Lady Annabel Goldsmith, pictured with her daughter Jemima Khan, has had double hip replacements . It was, as always, the event of ‘the season’ – Lady Annabel Goldsmith’s . summer garden party. Everyone who was anyone in London society was in . attendance, from members of the Royal Family (Prince Michael and . Princess Michael of Kent and their daughter Lady Gabriella Windsor, and . Viscount Linley), to Trudie Styler,  the wife of pop star Sting, Tara . Palmer-Tomkinson, and entrepreneur Ivan Massow. There were some . Rothschilds, a Parker Bowles or two, and designer Nicky Haslam, Lady . Goldsmith’s old drinking partner from her days partying at Annabel’s, . the nightclub named after her by her first husband, Mark Birley. As . always Annabel was flanked  by her glamorous children – Jemima Khan, . currently raising eyebrows by stepping out with controversial comedian . Russell Brand, Tory MP Zac, and financier Ben, who was accompanied by . his model girlfriend Jemima Jones. But, of course, it was the 79-year- old widow of billionaire tycoon  Sir James Goldsmith who was the centre of attention. As . her illustrious guests gathered around, Annabel recalled how she had . recently survived the ‘scrum’ at the funeral of Baroness Thatcher: ‘The . crowds were so vast .  .  . we had to abandon the car quite some way . from St Paul’s and push our way through the throng. At that point I was . grateful for my bionic hips.’ Lady Goldsmith was referring to her hip . replacements. Her right  one was replaced 30 years ago, the legacy of a . road accident when she was just three years old. About 70,000 Britons . undergo such a procedure each year, but the replacement of her left hip . four years ago has put Annabel among a small number of Britons who have . two prosthetic hip joints. Society figure: Lady Annabel with her late husband Sir James Goldsmith and their children Zac, now a Conservative MP,  Ben and Jemima in Spain in 1987 . Typically, one in ten patients will require their replacements to be replaced as they can wear out after 15 years or so, yet Annabel’s first has weathered remarkably well – and she is speaking about her health today to dispel the myths that surround the matter. ‘Yes, it was painful,’ she says. ‘I did have to take a . few painkillers after both operations – and I don’t ride any more. I was . advised against it as it can cause stress to the hips. 'There are scars . too, but in my case they have faded amazingly well, and I can hardly . notice them now. I would definitely recommend it to anyone suffering . from hip pain – if a doctor says it is suitable. My best advice is not . to be put off by fear.’ Bionic life: A hip replacement such as the one Lady Annabel has on her left . Recalling the original accident that triggered her problems, Lady Goldsmith says: ‘My sister Jane  and I had been staying with our grandparents in Northern Ireland, and we were being driven with our nanny to join our parents at our family home, Wynyard Park in  Co Durham. 'I think there was a collision with a hay wagon somewhere in the North of England. ‘Our mother wasn’t with us . because she was pregnant with my younger brother, Alistair. 'The . chauffeur and nanny had cuts and bruises but my sister and I seemed fine . at first. 'However, for the next few days I was in great pain. Nobody . seemed to realise that I had been injured – my hip was literally split . in two. 'When I eventually went to the doctor, he saw that my hip was . fractured. I have pictures of me with my leg in plaster up in the air. 'It was mended but they obviously did not do a good job.’ It was when Annabel’s daughter Jemima was aged ten that this childhood accident came back to haunt her. ‘I . was in my 40s and after having six children, my right hip was starting . to really hurt. I didn’t know why it was so painful. 'I went to have it . X-rayed and discovered that my hip had not been set properly after the . accident and there was a split in it. 'I am sure carrying weight during . pregnancy brought  it on. Reluctantly, I realised I would need a new . hip.’ At the time Annabel was extremely fit: she was a keen . horse-rider, walker and swimmer who was enthusiastically involved in all . her younger children’s games. ‘I was quite young to have the . operation, I suppose. But it was  no secret – everyone came to visit me . during my stay in hospital. I was released with strict instructions to . walk every day, with a stick at first, and to exercise at home. Back in the days: Lady Annabel pictured with Nicky Haslam, around the time of her first hip replacement in 1983 . ‘The . message then was the same as it is now – the secret of success with a . hip replacement is not just the operation or skill of the surgeon but . what you do yourself afterwards. 'The pain in the actual joint goes . immediately, but you do feel sore and stiff in a different way. With . exercise it gets a little better every day, and then after about a month . you’re back to normal. ‘I know some people’s bionic joints wear out . but mine has never bothered me. Many years later I realised that I was . experiencing pain in my left hip – I think I must have been putting more . weight on it to alleviate any strain on my right side. Hip replacements were  first introduced in the 1960s  for patients with damaged and painful joints. They are now performed on more people than ever. In the past 15 years the number of operations has increased by 50 per cent, and last year 75,000 people in the UK had a hip replacement. The operation works by replacing the damaged ‘ball and socket’ joint at the top of thigh with an artificial replica. Under general anaesthetic, the top of the patient’s thigh bone is removed and the adjoining socket in the pelvis hollowed out. Then a prosthetic socket is placed into the cavity and a shaft with a ball on the end is attached to the thigh bone. The procedure takes about an hour. The procedure’s long-term safety has been called into question recently by  the discovery that all-metal implants can release particles into the blood. Traditionally the prosthetic joint comprised a metal  ball and plastic socket, but  it can also be made from ceramic. In the 1990s ‘metal on metal’ replacements became increasingly popular. Concerns emerged when a number of patients with a particular brand of all-metal joints needed their surgery redone. It is now known that the devices wear down faster. An investigation found that the friction also causes tiny shards of metal to break off, which can leach into surrounding tissue, cause inflammation and entering the bloodstream. Doctors warn  the raised level of metals could prove toxic. Guidelines say patients with the larger metal implants – about 49,000  Britons have them – should have annual check-ups. At the height  of their popularity five years ago, metal joints accounted for about 15 per cent  of replacements but now the number is negligible. Ronan Treacy, orthopaedic surgeon at BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham, says: ‘The more common joint remains metal on plastic. Ceramic is often used in young people.’ The choice of implant is determined by factors including the patient’s age, activity expectation, joint deterioration and bone quality. The artificial joint should last  at least 15 years . Death rates after this surgery have halved since 2003, according to a study  last month.

'You think, . “Oh God, if I put weight on this it is going to hurt”, but it was . surprisingly easier than I thought, and I continued to walk up and down . the corridors and up and down the stairs as much as I could. 'If you . continue to do this, plus physiotherapy, the whole thing heals much . faster and one will get out of hospital sooner.’ Lady Goldsmith, who . was coy when asked about Jemima’s current romantic attachments (‘I do . not wish to speak about Russell Brand’), is now enjoying ‘running . around’ after her grandchildren, as well as keeping up with a typically . busy social diary and charity work for Battersea Dogs Home. She . says: ‘My message is this: you might not want to have an operation, but . no one does. I asked myself, “Do I want to end up crawling around  in . pain or do I want to just get it sorted out and get on with it?” ‘I’m not a hero or anything – people have this kind of thing all the time – but others are worried and I’d like them not to be.’ Annabel . does, however, concede there is one downside to having  had a double . hip replacement – as the joints are typically made from metal. ‘Whenever .

Don't bottle it up: release 'pent up tension' In the second part of our series  of mindfulness exercises – to help cope with chronic pain – DANNY PENMAN leads you through ‘Mindful Movement’ meditation. It encourages you to ‘tune in’ to your body to release pent-up tension. Being told to ‘smile’ can be annoying, but it might help your health. Psychologists asked students to watch cartoons and rate how funny they were. Some were asked to hold a pencil between their lips,  to mimic a scowl. Others held a pencil between their teeth, simulating a smile. Those forced to smile found the cartoons funnier. The process works in reverse too – frowning makes you unhappy. And a tense neck, back or shoulders can trigger anxiety and stress. Not only are emotions driven by such vicious cycles. Pain is too. Pain creates tension in the body. The brain responds by turning up the ‘volume’ on its pain amplifiers, creating even more suffering. Meditation can stop that cycle. Clinical trials show mindfulness can reduce pain by about 90 per cent and, with practice, your pain and suffering can evaporate. The following Mindful Movement meditation helps the body ‘unlearn’ tension. Do it once a day. Follow these instructions or download a free audio track from franticworld.com/mailonsunday. Also continue with last week’s ‘Body Scan’ exercise. It is taken from my book Mindfulness For Health. - Stand with feet hip-width apart. Relax your shoulders and breathe naturally. Gently hold and support your right elbow in your left hand. Rotate your right hand at the wrist in a circle for 30 seconds. Keep your breathing soft and even, and relax your arms. Then turn your wrist in the other direction for another 30 seconds. Mindful moves: The correct exercise can see chronic pain and aches banished forever . Notice the effects of the movement on your right hand and arm. Does this side feel different from the left? More alive? Switch elbows and repeat the movement with the other hand, again thinking of its effects. Then relax your arms so they hang at your sides. Close your eyes. Gently shake your hands and arms. What sensations do you feel? - Tune into your breathing. On the in-breath, extend both arms outwards to shoulder level, palms forwards. As you breathe out, gently draw both arms across your chest, cross your arms and give yourself a light hug . . Feel the back broadening and opening. Imagine the hug is saturated with kindness. On your next in-breath, open your arms until fully extended. Feel a corresponding opening in the chest, with the shoulder blades drawing together. Repeat this movement for a minute. Then let the hands hang at your sides and give them a shake. Feel your breath and the sensation of being alive..","Psychological tricks can help you improve your mood and ease pain .

The vast majority of adults have no idea how much saturated fat they should eat every day, a poll suggests. Some 84 per cent of adults do not know that men should eat no more than 30g of saturated fat each day and women should eat no more than 20g, the survey found. The poll, conducted by supermarket Sainsbury’s, also found that one in five adults think that all types of fat are bad for one’s health. Some 84 per cent of adults do not know that men should eat no more than 30g of saturated fat each day and women should eat no more than 20g . And 66 per cent of the 2,000 UK adults surveyed admitted they were confused by different types of fat. The news comes as health officials announced that almost half of the food manufacturing and retail industry in the UK has signed up to a pledge to reduce the amount of saturated fat in their products. A number of companies, including Sainsbury’s, have pledged to change their recipes to reduce saturated fat levels. Nestle has promised to change the recipe of its Kit Kat chocolate bars, Mondelez International is to ‘reformulate products across its portfolio’, including Oreos, and a number of supermarkets, including Tesco and Morrisons, will also reduce saturated fat in a number of products, a Department of Health spokeswoman said. If the nation could cut the amount of saturated fat it eats by 15 per cent around 2,600 premature deaths from heart diseases could be prevented every year, she added. The pledge is part of the Government’s ‘Responsibility Deal’ with the food industry which aims to curb the rising tide of obesity across the country by encouraging producers and retailers to reduce artificial trans fat, calories and salt in foods. But Tam Fry, trustee of the National Obesity Forum, said that ministers must consider proper regulation instead of working with the industry on a voluntary basis. ‘It is a small step in the right direction but it is only a small step,’ he said. Nestle has promised to change the recipe of its Kit Kat chocolate bars and Mondelez International is to 'reformulate products across its portfolio', including Oreos, to reduce saturated fat content . ‘This latest piece of hype from the Department of Health will mean over 50 per cent of food will still have extreme levels of saturated fat. ‘The much vaunted voluntary Responsibility Deal will never succeed until the Government takes a grip and makes everybody sign up to it.’ Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ‘One in six male deaths and one in nine female deaths are from coronary heart disease - this is why it’s critical that we challenge the way we eat and that we all make changes where we can. ‘It’s hugely encouraging that companies providing almost half of the food available on the UK market have committed to this new Responsibility Deal pledge and they are leading the way to give their customers healthier products and lower fat alternatives.’","84% of Britons don't know that men should eat a maximum of 30g of saturated fat a day and that women should eat no more than 20g a day .

If you are always hungry and just can't shed the pounds, then scientists may have discovered the reason why. British researchers have discovered a 'hungry gene' which they believe could cause obesity. The Cambridge University study has identified a possible genetic root to the insatiable appetite and slow metabolism in some people. Scientists have discovered a 'hungry gene' which they believe could explain the insatiable appetite and slow metabolism in some people . Looking at 2,101 patients who were severely obese, they found those with mutations of a gene called KSR2 were hungrier and burned less calories than people with a normal copy of the gene. Dr Sadaf Farooqi, of Cambridge University, said: 'Changes in diet and levels of physical activity underlie the recent increase in obesity. 'However, some people gain weight more easily than others. This variation between people is largely influenced by genetic factors. 'The discovery of a new obesity gene, KSR2, demonstrates that genes can contribute to obesity by reducing the metabolic rate - i.e. how well the body burns calories.' Dr Farooqi said the discovery could now provide clues to how obesity develops in children and help pave the wave for new drugs to treat the condition as well as type-2 diabetes, which is commonly linked with it. Further experiments in cells showed the KSR2 mutations also impaired metabolic processes in the body, such as the breaking down of glucose and fatty acids, which produce energy. The study authors also found the . diabetes drug metformin corrected the low levels of fatty acid oxidation . in cells with the KSR2 gene, suggesting it could be a potential . treatment in the future. 'This work adds to a growing body of . evidence that genes play a major role in influencing a person's weight . and may be useful for developing new ways to treat people who are heavy . and develop diabetes.' Dr Farooqi added. All in the DNA? Scientists found those with mutations of a gene called KSR2 were hungrier and burned less calories than people with a normal copy of the gene . The study was published in the journal Cell. Another rogue stretch of DNA that stops us feeling full and craving sugary and fatty foods - the FTO gene - was discovered several years ago. The gene, carried by more than half of the population, prevents a drop in the hunger hormone ghrelin after eating. The 16 per cent of the population that carries two copies of the rogue DNA are 70 per cent more likely to become obese than those without the gene. They eat up to 200 extra calories  a day and are almost half a stone heavier than their average counterparts. And for those with the ‘hunger gene’ dieting is doomed to failure. Even those who have inherited just one flawed FTO gene – 49 per cent of the population – are 30 per cent more likely to be obese.","Scientists found people with mutations .

A single mother who comfort ate when her confidence 'hit rock bottom' after she had a baby has turned her life around and dropped four dress sizes. At 5ft 3in tall, Maria Bacon, 30, from Dublin, had always been a petite size 10. But after she had her son six years ago, she suffered from post-natal depression. As a single mother caring for her baby, she began to feel isolated and alone and her unhappiness led to her comfort eating and neglecting her appearance. Used to hide under baggy clothes: Maria gained three-and-a-half-stone after becoming a mother, left, but is now feeling confident again after slimming to a dress size 12, right . She didn't have time to cook so she would often skip breakfast and lunch and . snack on unhealthy treats of crisps and chocolate instead, and then have a takeaway for dinner. She said: 'Before my son was born I . was a size 10 and had lots of confidence and friends, but after having . my son I piled on the weight and my confidence hit rock bottom. 'I always ate at the . wrong times and I never had three meals a day because I'd be eating . rubbish through the day and night and never felt full. I hated the way I . looked and had no belief in myself. I couldn't even look in the mirror.' Maria's weight increased to 13st 7lbs, dress size 20, and she wore baggy clothes to try and conceal her fuller figure. As her son grew older and became more active, her larger size meant she struggled to play with him which made her feel even worse about herself. 'I . couldn't keep up with my son, he always wanted to run around, but after . half an hour I was done and left feeling bad that I had disappointed him . by not playing longer,' she explained. Her weight gain also meant she didn't have the confidence to go on dates and she became more withdrawn and unsociable. Flabby to fit: The single mother plucked up the courage to start exercising - and found it gave her more energy, left, so she's now lost 3st, right . She said: 'I tried to hide my feelings from my . family and friends, but they all knew that over the years I had changed.

But I couldn't hide . from my family, my sister and I are very close and she knew how unhappy I . really was.' Maria's family encouraged her to go on a diet but she said: 'I tried loads of diets over the . years but nothing worked. It's not like I didn't want to try and lose . the weight, it's just they didn't work. Each time I tried and failed I . felt more miserable.' She added that she also felt exercise was unachievable. She said: 'It was a vicious circle. I had no energy . to exercise and so my weight carried on going up and my energy levels . plummeted. I felt drained all the time.' Active: Her weight increased after she had her son and she wanted to slim down so she had more energy to play with him . Maria then tried the Vi Challenge and found their 90 day diet and fitness plan was one she could finally stick to. She set her target weight at 10st - what she had weighed before becoming a mother - and has almost achieved that target as she now weighs 10st 7Ib, a dress size 12.

I'm like a new women, I've lost weight and gained back my confidence I'm even considering dating again. 'I'm now able to take my son to the park and chase around after him now, we can go on walks or I'll walk along with him whilst he's on his bike.

Rowling sat down in a café in Edinburgh and penned her first Harry Potter book, little did she know the literary phenomenon she was creating. Until now, predicting exactly what makes book a bestseller was somewhat of a mystery, yet researchers from New York claim to have created an algorithm to do just that. By analysing the words used in classic books, the algorithm was able to correctly predict which books were bestsellers, and which were less successful, in 84 per cent of cases. Computer scientists analysed books including Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, pictured left, and Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol, right. They then used an algorithm to predict each book's relative success. By comparing the predictions with book sales, the researchers correctly guessed success in 84% of cases . Successful books tended to feature . more nouns and adjectives, as well as a disproportionate use of the . words ‘and’ and ‘but’ - when compared with less successful titles. The most popular books also featured . more verbs relating to ‘thought-processing’ such as ‘recognised’ and . ‘remembered’. Verbs that serve the purpose of quotes and reports, for . example the word ‘say’ and ‘said’, were heavily featured throughout the . bestsellers. Alternatively, less successful books . featured ‘topical, cliché’ words and phrases such as ‘love’, as well as negative and extreme words including . ‘breathless’ and ‘risk’. Poor-selling books also favoured the . use of ‘explicitly descriptive verbs of actions and emotions’ such as . ‘wanted’, ‘took’, ‘promised’ ‘cried’ and ‘cheered’. Books that made . explicit reference to body parts also scored poorly. Overall, they found that successful books contained a high number of nouns and adjectives - and plenty of quotes. The algorithm, developed at Stony Brook University, used a method called ‘statistical stylometry’ that can mathematically analyse words and grammar in text. Computer scientists from the university began by downloading classic books from the Project Gutenberg archive, including Charles Dickens' A Tale Of Two Cities, Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol and Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. They also scanned bestselling lists on Amazon. Each book’s text was scanned using a specially-designed algorithm. This algorithm then predicted the success of each title. These predictions were compared to the success of each title, based on historical stats, figures and critical reaction, and were able to match the popularity of the book 84 per cent of the time.

Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol was . among the least successful, alongside My Life As A Man, by Philip Roth. ‘Predicting the success of literary works poses a massive dilemma for publishers and aspiring writers alike,’ explained assistant professor Yejin Choi. ‘Previous work has attempted to gain insights into the ‘secret recipe’ of successful books. But most of these studies were qualitative, based on a dozen books, and focused primarily on high-level content - the personalities of protagonists and antagonists and the plots. ‘Our work examines a considerably larger collection - 800 books - over multiple genres, providing insights into lexical, syntactic, and discourse patterns that characterise the writing styles commonly shared among the successful literature.’ The findings have been published by the Association of Computational Linguistics.","Researchers downloaded classic books from the Project Gutenberg archive .

It could also be used to track the progression of the disease and to measure the effectiveness of treatments. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. is working with a video game design company to test whether video games can detect cognitive differences in healthy elderly people who are at risk of dementia. A video game, which can be played on iPads and iPhones, could be used to detect the early signs of Alzheimer's disease. It could also used to track the progression of the disease . Akili Interactive Labs Inc. says this is the first time a pharmaceutical company has tested the use of video games as a clinical tool for picking up the early signs of degenerative neurological diseases. As part of the trial, experts will evaluate 100 healthy elderly people both with and without amyloid in their brains. The game is designed to measure and improve the ability of patients to deal with distractions which impact their ability to pay attention, plan and make decisions. Image shows CT scans of a brain with Alzheimer's . Amyloid is thought to be the most likely cause of the damage that underpins Alzheimer's disease, meaning people with it are perceived to be at high risk, while those without it are at lower risk. The volunteers’ cognitive abilities will be assessed at the start of the study and during one month of playing the game which is called Project:EVO and which runs on iPhones and iPads. The game requires the volunteers to steer around a track while, at the same time, shooting road signs. The researchers hope to discover whether the game could be used to help identify early Alzheimer’s. The game is designed to measure and improve the ability of the participants to deal with distractions and interruptions which impact their ability to pay attention, plan and make decisions. Such deficits are common symptoms of many degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, but also of conditions such as ADHD, autism and depression. Michael Ehlers, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of the Neuroscience Research Unit at Pfizer, said: ‘A tool that enables cognitive monitoring for the selection and assessment of clinical trial patients has the potential to be an important advance in Alzheimer’s research and beyond.’ Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia which is a general term for memory loss and loss of other intellectual abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. There are estimated to be about 650,000 people in England with Alzheimer's disease, most of whom are over the age of 65. There is currently no test to effectively diagnose Alzheimer’s disease – doctors have to make a diagnosis based on their assessment of the symptoms.","The game could also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments .

But splashing out thousands of pounds doesn't always guarantee a good result. Indeed, as 57-year-old retired nurse, Yvonne, from Herefordshire discovered, it doesn't always mean that anything has been done at all. Shockingly, Yvonne, who had a face and neck lift in 2011, was left with more wrinkles than when she began thanks to a rogue surgeon who failed to complete the procedure. Devastated: Yvonne was distraught when her facelift was botched so badly, her face collapsed . Instead, as she later discovered, he had used liposuction to produce a smooth result but had managed to inflict catastrophic damage to her facial muscles at the same time. As a result, less than a year after she had the treatment, Yvonne's face collapsed, leaving her with sagging skin and wrinkles 'more suited to a woman in her 70s'. Yvonne, who says she has barely left the house in three years because of the disaster, says: 'There's no other way to describe it, really, other than a nightmare. I just don't want this face. 'I had my eyes done, upper and lower, . face and neck,' she adds. But less than a year later 'I seemed to have blinked and [the facelift] had gone. 'The neck had . dropped, the chin had dropped and shortly after, the rest of face had . gone too. 'It's caused me so much stress, anxiety . and heartache - you name it, I've been there this last couple of years . or so because of this.' Change: After being unable to leave home for three years, Yvonne has now had the neck lift she wanted . Although Yvonne returned to the original doctor and asked him to fix the botched facelift, his efforts only made things worse, as cosmetic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh points out. 'Yvonne is a classic example of a patient, who's gone in looking for one type of operation and been given a different one,' he says. Speaking during a consultation filmed for TLC documentary, Extreme Beauty Disasters, he adds: 'I can't see that anyone's touched [the] neck so that's why it was back . down within a month.' To add insult to injury, Yvonne's first surgeon even tried to convince her that her face was drooping not because of his shoddy work, but because she hadn't chosen to have Botox as well. 'When you get a patient like Yvonne, where they've had surgery but it's . not right, and you tell them it's not right, the first emotion they . have is relief that they're not mad,' adds Dr Vijh. Relieved: Yvonne says she feels 'marvellous' and hopes to be able to live a normal life once more . 'But then that turns to anger as they . realise they were lied to, as they realise that what they paid for . isn't what they've got.' Unfortunately for Yvonne, fixing the damage means another operation to lift the neck and plump up the skin with fat taken from another part of the body, and a peel to minimise fine lines. 'I'm hoping that it'll give me back some of the self-confidence that I've lost over the years,' adds Yvonne. Six weeks after surgery and Yvonne's muscles are mended and her face well on the way to looking normal again. 'I'm just feeling ecstatic. I just really can't put it into words,' she enthuses, despite the swathe of bandages still covering her face. Dr Vijh is more circumspect. 'I just hope now she has the confidence to get up, get out, start seeing her friends again and live a normal life,' he says. Yvonne appears in Extreme Beauty Disasters, Thursday at 8pm on TLC .","Yvonne, 57, left with badly sagging face after botched surgery .

Many scientists believe it’s only a matter of time before we find an Earth 2.0 – a theorised planet much like our own. Now one astronomer has put a date on it. Dr Franck Marchis, who works for the SETI Institute, believes we may find a planet like our own by 2024. His prediction is based on recent advances in technology that have allowed scientists to capture images of planets and their orbiting stars up to 63 light years away. Dr Franck Marchis, who works for the SETI Institute, believes we may find a planet like our own by 2024. Pictured here is  Kepler-20f exoplanet. This Earth-sized planet is found in the constellation Lyra . Namely, the Gemini Planet Imager, which last week took an image of a 10-million-year-old planet named Beta Pictorus b from 370 trillion miles away. Gemini has been under development for nearly a decade, but this was the first image to be released by the instrument. ‘The search for Earth-like planets, the search for an Earth 2.0 is very close,’ said Dr Franck Marchis works for the SETI Institute in an interview with Brett Brownell from Mother Jones. ‘I think in 10 or 15 years we will have an Earth 2.0 candidate.’ Gemini Planet Imager's first light image of Beta Pictoris b, a planet orbiting the star Beta Pictoris. The star, Beta Pictoris, is blocked in this image by a mask so its light doesn't interfere with the light of the planet. Beta Pictoris b is a giant planet - several times larger than Jupiter - and is approximately ten million years old . The Gemini Planet Imager is the world's most advanced planet hunting instrument built for the Gemini Telescope in Chile. It . is designed to image extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars. In 2011, . the GPI Exoplanet Survey team was selected to carry out an 890-hour . survey campaign from 2014 to 2016 to search and characterise exoplanets . around 600 stars. GPI, which is the size of a small car, . detects infrared radiation from young Jupiter-like planets in wide . orbits around other stars, equivalent to the giant planets in our own solar system not long after their formation. It . does this using silicon microchip deformable mirrors to remove . atmospheric turbulence, and something known as coronagraphic masks - a . telescopic attachment designed to block out the direct light from a star . so that nearby objects. Scientists claim Gemini is the most advanced such instrument to be deployed on one of the world’s biggest telescopes – the eight-metre Gemini South telescope in Chile. ‘Even these early first-light images are almost a factor of 10 better than the previous generation of instruments,’ said Bruce Macintosh of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who led the team that built the instrument. ‘This is the grail of modern astronomy,’ Dr Marchis told Mother Jones. ‘We're trying desperately now to image those planets because we know they exist. ‘When you observe a planet with [the now defunct telescope] Kepler, what you've been doing is basically detecting the transit - the attenuation of [the star's] light - due to the planet passing between us and the star. ‘Now with GPI, the Gemini Planet Imager, which is mounted at the eight meter class telescope in Chile we're going to be able to see the planet itself.’ Data from the Kepler telescope suggests that one in every five sun-like stars in the Milky Way may have an Earth-sized planet circling it in the Goldilocks zone - an area where liquid water could exist. But researchers recently suggested the figure could be even higher. Scientists in Scotland last week announced that Earth-sized planets can support life at least ten times further away from stars than previously thought. This means that cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface. Dr Marchis believes GPI will be able to provide a clearer picture of exactly which planets are habitable. ‘This is the first light data. So it's not perfect. It looks impressive but I'm telling you: in six months it's going to be even more impressive,’ said Dr Marchis. He added that there are currently some issues with the instrument. It's new, and so has to be tuned to perform better. ‘Imagine one day, we're going to be able to see seasonal effects on these planets and be able to see if there is a biosphere,’ he said.

Swollen stomach: Hayley Barley, 24, suffers with Hirschsprung's disease which regularly causes her abdomen to swell to the point she looks pregnant . A mother-of-four has told of her anguish of constantly having to tell strangers she is not pregnant because of a rare condition which causes her stomach to swell. Hayley Barley, 24, suffers from Hirschsprung's disease which regularly causes her abdomen to swell to the point where she appears heavily pregnant. Mrs Barley revealed she is regularly asked for her due date and offered seats on buses from well-meaning people who have mistaken her serious bowel condition for pregnancy. She said: 'It's nice that people are kind, but their kindness just makes me feel more self-conscious. 'I'm normally size eight, and it's devastating to go through such a drastic change.' Mrs Barley, who is mother to Frankie, aged five, Sommer, four, Marshall, three, and one-year-old Caitlin, is being supported by her husband Frank, 42, as she prepares to undergo a life-changing surgery in December to remove most of her damaged bowel. The operation, which surgeons hope will stop the alarming swelling, will require her to be fitted with a colostomy bag. 'It's ruining my life,' she said. 'I have kids to look after, which is difficult enough without having to deal with my condition. 'I try to laugh it off when I'm out and about and people congratulate me for my 'pregnancy'. I keep a smile on my face, but it's always a difficult thing to hear. 'It's very thoughtful when people offer me their seat if I'm standing on a bus, but it also makes me feel awkward.' People are usually diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease when they are children, but Mrs Barley did not begin to experience the stabbing pains and swelling associated with the condition until she was 12-years-old. Rare: Mrs Barley is often mistaken for being heavily pregnant by strangers who ask when her due date is . The condition means that part of her large intestine doesn't have any nerves, making it extremely difficult for material to pass through her digestive system. The result is frequently painful and dangerous bloating. Her stomach swells over the course of a month until the point where she is so bloated that moving and bending is extremely painful for her. She has visited hospital 69 times since 2009 for emergency procedures to relieve the pressure on her abdomen. If left untreated the condition, which is diagnosed in approximately one in 5,000 children, can lead to life-threatening infections. Even doctors have been misled by Mrs Barley's outward appearance. Drastic measures: Mrs Barley, who is normally a size eight, now intends to have an operation to remove most of her bowel to stop the bloating . She recalled: 'In December last year the pain became unbearable. My belly was the biggest it had ever been, and I couldn't stop being sick. 'Frank volunteered to look after the kids while I went to see a doctor. The first thing the GP asked was how far along I was. 'I tried to explain I wasn't pregnant and went through my medical history. But after he felt my stomach he was sure I was expecting and he even suspected I was in labour. 'He told me to go to hospital, explaining that the symptoms of my condition might have masked an actual pregnancy. 'I attended hospital but, of course, I wasn't pregnant at all.' Now Mrs Barley, from Birmingham, is coming to terms with having a colostomy at the age of 24. She said: 'It's a drastic step but I'm looking forward to not being in constant pain. Some people might look at me and think my 'baby bump' is a blessing, but it's been nothing but a curse.' Brave decision: Mrs Barley, pictured with her husband Frank, 42, knows the surgery is a drastic step but says it will be worth it to end the pain of her condition .","Mother-of-four Hayley Barley, 24, suffers from Hirschsprung's disease .

An antioxidant created in the lab could keep our skin younger for longer by protecting it from sun damage. Scientists at Newcastle University say the molecule, Tiron, gives complete protection from UVA rays - which make up 95 per cent of the UV radiation in sunlight. They hope Tiron could be given to people in food or cosmetics. Discovery: Molecule Tiron gives complete protection from UVA rays - which make up 95 per cent of the UV radiation in sunlight (library image) UVA radiation speeds up skin ageing and causes wrinkles. It penetrates deep into the skin, damaging connective tissue and increasing the risk of skin cancer. The sun’s rays also contain UVB, a type of radiation which causes sunburn and is again linked to skin cancer. Team leader Professor Mark Birch-Machin said the results, published in the FASEB Journal, are ‘exciting and promising’. He added it is ‘early days’ for developing the antioxidant into a useable form – and more tests are needed to make sure it is not toxic.

Taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland must not be allowed to double its bonus cap, Labour warned today. George Osborne is facing calls to reject any demand for RBS to increase its payouts to senior staff in the City. David Cameron announced that cash payouts would be capped at £2,000 but RBS is expected to invoke an EU rule that allows it to pay bonuses in shares up to double an employee's salary - twice the normal rate - provided they are approved by the shareholders. Scroll down for video . Royal Bank of Scotland is 82 per cent owned by the British taxpayer, putting the Treasury in control of bonus payouts . However Labour's call for a cap on bonuses was dismissed as unworkable by Bank of England governor Mark Carney. RBS is 82-per cent owned by the government, making Mr Osborne effectively the largest shareholder. Labour will force a vote on the issue in the Commons today calling on the Government to reject any request to raise the bonus cap. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said: 'I can confirm today that just as we have had limits on cash bonuses of £2,000 at RBS this year and last year, we will do the same next year as well.' He added: 'If there are any proposals to increase the overall pay, that is pay and bonus bill at RBS, at the investment bank, any proposals for that, we will veto it.' However, Labour insisted that shares bonuses worth double salaries should not be allowed to go ahead. Labour’s shadow treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie said: ‘At a time when families face a cost-of-living crisis and bank lending to business is falling, it cannot be right for George Osborne to approve a doubling of the bank bonus cap.’ He denied want to ‘hobble RBS, but insisted allowing bankers to be paid double their salary was an ‘astonishing thing to do’. Chancellor George Osborne is facing calls from Labour to act on bonuses . He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I think it’s a matter of embarrassment that UK policy on bonuses was not determined by the UK Treasury, it was left to the European Union to take action.’ New laws which came into effect on January 1 mean that bonuses must not be higher than 100 per cent of a banker’s salary. But it can be raised to 200 per cent if shareholders approve. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said he does not back a 'crude bonus cap' on pay in banks or proposals to restrict their size. He said he 'absolutely' agreed with the conclusions of the parliamentary commission on banking standards that it was not convinced a 'crude bonus cap' was the right way to control pay. However, Tory MP Mark Garnier said banker bonuses should be seen as ‘compensation for enterprise’. ‘The whole point about these bonuses is you shouldn't be talking about them in terms of a kind of 'reward', it’s actually a compensation for enterprise,’ he told Radio 4. ‘Let's not forget, investment banks do a lot of good as well as bad, they do a lot of good in terms of raising capital in British industry.’ He insisted there has been a ‘huge amount of work’ done by the regulators to reform the bonus structure in banks, including removing ‘perverse incentives and perverse outcomes’ of large short-term pay-outs encouraging excessive risk-taking. A Treasury spokesman said: 'Our normal principles apply. There needs to be restraint. Bonuses need to be significantly down on where they were at the time of the crisis and in the last parliament.'","EU rules enforced this month limit bonuses to 100% of a banker's salary .

Fight: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan will not 'cave in' to Brussels, aides say . Iain Duncan Smith accused the European Commission of a ‘blatant’ power-grab yesterday as unelected Brussels bureaucrats took Britain to court over benefits for immigrants. The Work and Pensions Secretary vowed to fight ‘every step of the way’ to retain rules that force EU migrants to pass a ‘right to residency’ test before they can claim a host of benefits. But, in an embarrassing twist for the Government, the Mail can reveal that the pressure group which made the original legal complaint has actually been funded by the Foreign Office. Around £500,000 of taxpayers’ money was paid over five years to Advice on Individual Rights in Europe, which has brought test cases demanding the right for EU immigrants not to have to undergo a residency test. Ministers were accused of having ‘lost the plot’ for funding the very people who want them prosecuted for discrimination. If Brussels bosses get their way, officials estimate, it will cost taxpayers up to £155million a year in extra benefits for EU immigrants already in the UK and may encourage thousands more to move to the UK, pushing costs up higher still. Ministers have previously claimed that a total of £2billion a year is paid out in benefits to foreign nationals. The Commission referred the UK to the EU’s Court of Justice over the right-to-reside test imposed on nationals from member states since 2004. Ministers have previously claimed that a total of £2billion a year is paid out in benefits to foreign nationals. In a statement it said: ‘The UK discriminates unfairly against nationals from other member states. This contravenes EU rules.’ The Spanish government is being sued by the European Commission over the refusal of some hospitals to recognise the European Health Insurance Card. The card allows EU citizens to access free healthcare in public hospitals across the continent. But patients in some Spanish hospitals have had the card refused and told to reclaim treatment costs from their travel insurance, the Commission claims. The Spanish health ministry said the EHIC 'has worked properly in Spain for years'. A spokesman told the BBC there was '""no proof' that some British citizens had been pressured, or even tricked, into paying via their private travel insurance. The Commission said some EU migrants . are missing out on payments including child benefit, child tax credit, . and jobseekers allowance. But Mr Duncan Smith accused the . Commission of a ‘blatant land-grab’ against national governments by . using the court case to seize control of welfare payments – a sphere . that is the preserve of national governments. He said: ‘People in this country . expect me to protect the benefits system from abuse and protect the . money of hardworking taxpayers. ‘I will not cave in and I will . continue to work on strengthening our benefit system in the meantime to . ensure it is not open to abuse by anyone.’ He added: ‘What is going on at the . moment is that the Commission is trying to use freedom of movement as a . way in to start controlling what national governments do about those who . are not in work in their countries.’ But ministers faced criticism after . it emerged that they have been funnelling cash to the group that has . persuaded the Commission to take the Government to court. Europe Minister David Lidington has . confirmed that the Foreign Office gave £455,500 to Advice on Individual . Rights in Europe between 2006 and 2011.

GPs are being paid nearly £1,500 a shift to work nights and weekends in crisis-hit A&E units. Four in ten casualty departments are . hiring family doctors – already paid an average £104,000 a year – to . help deal with the soaring numbers of patients. The figures emerged on the day doctors came under fire for suggesting that patients should be charged up to £10 a visit to a casualty unit to deter those who do not need to be there. Moonlighting: Of the 86 trusts which replied to FoI requests, 36 said they employed GPs in a range of roles including assessing patients when they arrived, treating the less seriously-ill and providing general cover . Critics said it was extraordinary that doctors, who for the past decade have been allowed to choose not to work out-of-hours, were moonlighting at stretched A&E units for extra cash. Using the Freedom of Information Act, the Mail asked all 130 NHS hospital trusts in England with A&E units whether they employed GPs in their casualty departments and, if so, how much they were paid. Of the 86 trusts which replied, 36 said they employed GPs in a range of roles including assessing patients when they arrived, treating the less seriously-ill and providing general cover. Hourly rates vary from £50 at Wirral hospital in Merseyside to £98 at Wrightington, Wigan, and £100 at Portsmouth Hospitals. At least one recruitment firm is offering family doctors £120 an hour for a 12-hour shift – a total of £1,440 – at St Thomas’ Hospital in South London. Primary Care People, which recruits for hospitals across London, also said it would pay £115 an hour for a 12-hour overnight shift at the Royal London hospital in East London, or £90 an hour for a day shift. A source at the firm said the rates were so good that doctors were travelling to the capital from all over the country, including one who drives 120 miles down from Birmingham to do two shifts a week. The firm covers all travel expenses and pays for GPs to stay in a three or four-star hotel if needed, on a budget of £60 a night, which is billed back to the NHS. Good rates: The Accident & Emergency department at St Thomas' Hospital in South London, where at least one recruitment firm is offering family doctors £120 an hour for a 12-hour shift - a total of £1,440 . A&E units across England are facing what is feared to be one of the worst-ever winters and many are struggling to cope with a huge influx in patients on top of desperate shortages of consultants. Over the past decade the numbers of patients arriving in casualty has soared by 50 per cent and this has partly been blamed on failings of GP out-of-hours’ care. GPs have been allowed to opt out of working evenings and weekends since a botched contract negotiated in 2004 and services are largely provided by out-of-hours firms, which many patients don’t trust. Last night Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: ‘GPs can’t be prepared to turn out for their own patients but they are happy to work elsewhere for a lot more money. ‘So much for the interests of the patients, it’s the interests of the doctors which are paramount. The reason patients are going to A&E is because they can’t get into their own surgery. It’s ludicrous.’ Britain has fewer doctors per person than nearly all other European countries, according to a report. There are an average of 2.71 medics for every 1,000 people, compared to six in Greece, five in Austria and nearly four in Italy. A European Commission report ranks the UK 24th out of 27 countries in the EU, ahead of only Poland, Romania and Slovenia. Dr Paul Flynn, chairman of the British Medical  Association’s consultants committee, said: ‘Only by making working practices and environments safe and sustainable will the NHS  be able to attract and retain the required number and mix of doctors.’ Rehana Azam, of the union GMB which represents NHS staff, added: ‘It’s extremely worrying, particularly as we are facing the toughest winter in years.’ Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, a GP who sits on the Health Select Committee, said hiring GPs in A&Es could result in even more patients turning up as they realised they could see a doctor more quickly. She added: ‘We need to make sure it’s easier for people to see a GP out of hospital.’ It emerged yesterday that a third of GPs want to charge patients up to £10 for going to A&E to try to reduce the number of ‘inappropriate’ attendances. A poll of 800 family doctors by the website doctors.net.uk found that 32 per cent were in favour of fees – with the money being returned to patients if they were seriously ill. John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Too often extra staff are needed because people turn to A&E when they can’t get a GP appointment. ‘So it’s particularly galling that GPs are then paid so much to provide cover. Providing a genuine out-of-hours service would ease the pressure on A&E, thereby reducing the need for expensive temps.’ Shadow health minister Jamie Reed said: ‘Family doctors are now being pulled into the chaos at England’s hospitals. David Cameron has left A&Es struggling to recruit – and the worse things get, the harder it will become.’ Only a fifth of GPs do any out-of-hours work and those who do undertake an average of four hours a week. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘It’s not unusual for A&E departments to employ in-house GPs – they provide a valuable source of expertise and help patients to be seen and treated promptly. ‘We know that the whole system of out-of-hours care needs to be changed. That’s why we’ve agreed a new GP contract, backed by doctors, which is part of a longer-term plan to bring back the personal link with patients so GPs can focus on giving people the care they need and preventing unnecessary trips to A&E in the first place.’","Four in ten casualty departments hiring GPs to cope with soaring numbers .

Removed: Topman was forced to remove hundreds of T-shirts after being accused of promoting sexism . Last year, Topman was forced to apologise and clear its shelves of hundreds of ‘sexist’ T-shirts. Dozens of customers complained about two designs at Topman, one of which was said to have glamorised domestic violence by listing male excuses such as ‘You provoked me’. The other T-shirt carried the slogan ‘Nice New Girlfriend: What Breed Is She?’ – prompting complaints that women were being likened to cattle and dogs. Bad at maths but good at...? Forever 21's offering, left, and JC Penney's, right, have also raised the ire of commentators who deem the shirt designs offensive . One shopper wrote a message on the chain’s website, saying: ‘Apparently Topman think domestic violence makes a hilarious T-shirt slogan.’ Another posted: ‘Let’s glamorise domestic violence, shall we? Topman you should be ashamed of yourselves.’ The T-shirts were also condemned by campaigners. Forever 21 came under fire in September for releasing a football-style T-shirt for girls emblazoned with the slogan 'Allergic to Algebra.' The LA-based retailer soon removed the controversial tee from stores. In August, JC Penney has been forced to back down over a slogan sweatshirt after the blogosphere went into overdrive over its apparently demeaning message. The white top read 'I'm too pretty to do homework, so my brother has to do it for me' and was aimed at 7-16 year olds. Some claimed the retail giant's apology over the misjudged top to be a 'women's rights victory.'",The beige pair of chinos were purchased in London at Madhouse’s flagship Oxford Street store last month .

TV superchef Ludo Lefebvre (right) has told how he and Nigella Lawson, his co-star on new cookery show The Taste, have become 'very, very, very close' Nigella Lawson's French co-star in her new cookery show has spoken of how the pair have become 'very, very, very close'. TV superchef Ludo Lefebvre described the British cook as 'a great woman' as he spoke about how the pair, who are both judges on new show The Taste, had become friends. Mr Lefebvre said it 'broke my heart' to see his co-star's ordeal during the trial of her former housekeepers who were cleared of fraud last month. In an interview with The Times, Mr Lefebvre described how he first saw Miss Lawson on television when he moved to America in 1996, but they met for the first time last year. The married chef, 42, said: 'We have become very, very, very close - we click right away.' He went on to say seeing the court appearance 'broke my heart' before adding: 'Have you heard anything like this before? No. Because she is a great woman.' His wife, lawyer Kristine Lefebvre, went on to say Miss Lawson had described the French chef as 'a very good-looking younger brother'. Lisa and Francesca Grillo had been accused of spending £685,000 on credit cards given to them by Miss Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi. The pair were acquitted by a jury even though Francesca, 35, had used her family card to spend £8,000 on designer clothes in a single day. Their defence, which involved drug allegations against their former boss, was that the TV cook let them spend whatever they liked providing they kept quiet about her cocaine and cannabis use. Mr Lefebvre and Miss Lawson appear alongside Anthony Bourdain on new cookery show The Taste . The jury also heard Miss Lawson describe her ex-husband as a ‘brilliant but brutal man’ who grabbed her throat out of jealousy when she idly wished for grandchildren, and who she said drove her to drugs with his ‘intimate terrorism’. Charles Saatchi last week made a statement to the Daily Mail claiming he and Miss Lawson started their relationship while the celebrity chef's first husband John Diamond was still alive. When she gave evidence in court last month, Miss Lawson said she only 'became involved' with Mr Saatchi after her first husband passed away. 'It would be fair to say that not very long after my first husband died I began to become involved with Mr Saatchi,' she told the jury at Isleworth Crown Court. Charles Saatchi (left) last week claimed he and Miss Lawson started their relationship while the celebrity chef's first husband John Diamond (right, with Miss Lawson) was still alive .

However, the 70-year-old millionaire told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'Nigella and I began our relationship during the last six months of her husband John Diamond's life, rather than after his death as she [Nigella] stated in court. 'Looking back at that time, I very deeply regret that this betrayal of John occurred.' The timing of this 'confession' infuriated Nigella's friends, who described it as a 'wicked attempt to smear her'. Team Nigella has fiercely denied the claims that she betrayed Mr Diamond by starting a relationship with the advertising tycoon before his death in March 2001. Miss Lawson and Mr Diamond married in Venice in 1992 and they later had two children together before he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997.","Ludo Lefebvre said the pair 'click right away' after they met a year ago .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 16:22 EST, 8 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:33 EST, 9 January 2014 . White House press secretary Jay Carney said he hadn't looked at his copy of 'Duty' by Robert Gates, but a staffer read the book overnight and sections were frantically distributed by morning inside the West Wing and elsewhere . The Obama administration was blindsided' by bombshell accusations in a book by former secretary of defense Robert Gates, according to a White House staffer with knowledge of Tuesday's events in the White House. 'They're breaking it down and dividing it up in the West Wing,' the aide told MailOnline, describing a frantic scene. 'No one saw this coming.' The source requested anonymity since he is not authorized to speak publicly. Jay Carney, the White House's press secretary, opened Wednesday's press briefing by asking reporters, 'Read any good books lately?' He said he had received a copy of the book Tuesday night, a half-day after The Wall Street Journal published an excerpt online and portions were leaked to The Washington Post, The New York Times and other press outlets. Carney downplayed the seismic event that gripped Washington on Tuesday, saying he hadn't read the book, titled, 'Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War.' 'I don’t know who else got a copy,' a coy Carney told reporters. ""I got a copy. ... I haven’t had time to look at it yet.' But National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden acknowledged to MailOnline that the book 'was read by a member of the White House staff overnight.' She declined to name the staffer, and said she would not go 'into further detail about ... how it was distributed within the White House.' Scroll down for video . Jay Carney faced a skeptical press corps on Wednesday, a half-day after receiving a copy of Gates' book -- which the White House acknowledged was devoured by a staffer overnight . Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has given Republicans something to wave around in 2016, with new revelations about President Obama's war rationale and Hillary Clinton's preference for politics over principle . She insisted that Carney 'was completely accurate in what he said at the podium' on Wednesday, emphasizing that 'Jay has not yet read the book, as he said.' But the White House staffer who spoke to MailOnline said that 'by morning there were chapters floating around.' In a separate conversation, he added that 'this is very, very bad. Jay is spinning everyone. But then, that's his job.' Carney refused to directly defend President Obama on Wednesday against charges that he lost faith in his own strategy for the war in Afghanistan after he took office. Now, however, 'the president has great faith in the troops that carried out the mission and in the mission itself,' Carney said. The White House spokesman repeated a flattering portion of one quote from the book that appeared in the Post's review – without referring to the line's less-than-favorable conclusion. Gates wrote that 'I never doubted Obama’s support for the troops, only his support for their mission.' Carney cited only the first half of that sentence. Photojournalists were allowed a rare opportunity Wednesday to capture Barack Obama and Joe Biden together at lunch, in a move that Carney would not conceded was calculated to defend the vice president against Gates' attacks . Gates writes that Biden was 'wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades' -- but the White House rushed to the VP's defense . The former defense secretary wrote in . his memoir, due out next week, that as Obama lost faith in Gen. David . Petraeus' handling of hostilities in . Afghanistan, he – Gates – lost faith in Obama's commitment to . accomplishing much of anything. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates' memoirs will go on sale January 14, following a PR offensive that 'blindsided' the White House . 'As . I sat there,' he recalled, 'I thought: The president doesn’t trust his . commander, can’t stand [President Hamid] Karzai, doesn’t believe in his . own strategy and doesn’t consider the war to be his.' 'For him, it’s all about getting out.' And of Obama's surge of . 30,000 troops in Afghanistan, Gates said the commander-in-chief was 'skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail.' Carney insisted on Wednesday that Gates' recollections were evidence that the president welcomed a diversity of opinions among the consciously chosen 'team of rivals' that made up his war council. Obama 'would not make a decision about surging U.S. troops without a thorough debate,' Carney insisted. 'When it comes to the interagency process,' he said, 'the president expects it to be robust, and he expects to hear competing points of view from every member of his national security team.' But he stopped short of declaring that Gates was incorrect in his assessment, even when reporters pressed him. The White House was quick on Tuesday night to defend Vice President Joe Biden against Gates' charge that he 'has been wrong . on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over . the past four decades.' But while the administration's statement, delivered via the National Security Council, called Biden 'one of the leading statesmen of his time,' it didn't defend Obama directly. Obama, shown during a 2010 trip to Afghanistan, doubted that his own troop surge in that country would meet with any success, Gates writes, but he ultimately decided to pull out of the country in order to help his re-election chances . Carney refused to concede Wednesday that a staged photo-op of the president and Biden sharing lunch was meant as a show of support for the vice president, who is among Democrats touted as potential presidential candidates in 2016. News photographers were permitted to photograph the pair Wednesday, a rare occurrence in the Obama administration. The president’s schedule for the day includes five meetings where Biden will be present. Carney described the photo call as a 'total coincidence.' 'You can decide for yourself what you want to believe.' Carney also did not defend either President Obama or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton against Gates' bombshell revelation that both placed political calculations ahead of military strategy when they opposed President George W. Bush's Iraq troop surge before the 2008 presidential election season kicked off. Describing a 'remarkable' exchange he . witnessed, Robert Gates writes in a book due out next week that 'Hillary . told the president that her opposition to the [2007] surge in Iraq had . been political because she was facing him in the Iowa primary.' Obama, . too, 'conceded vaguely that [his] opposition to the Iraq surge had been . political,' Gates recounts. 'To hear the two of them making these . admissions, and in front of me, was as surprising as it was dismaying.' Hillary Clinton staked out her Iraq policy in late 2006 not on a military calculation, but based on how she could aid her soon-to-come presidential campaign, according to Gates' memoir . Gates ultimately concluded in his book that Obama was 'inexperienced' yet 'determined to change course – and equally determined from day one to win re-election.' 'Domestic political considerations would therefore be a factor,' he wrote, 'though I believe never a decisive one, in virtually every major national security problem we tackled.' A publicist with Knopf Doubleday, . which is publishing the memoir, told MailOnline that The Wall Street Journal paid . for the rights to publish the excerpt from Gates' book on Tuesday, and hinted that more may be coming. 'Serial rights were sold to the Wall Street Journal,' Brittany Morrongiello emailed, 'and are in place through on-sale date of 1/14/14.'","Obama spokesman Jay Carney coyly told reporters that he hasn't 'had time to look at' Robert Gates' new book despite receiving a copy Tuesday night .

Brave John Masterson, a social studies teacher at Berrendo Middle School, convinced the shooter, today identified as 12-year-old Mason Campbell, to put down the .20-gauge, sawed off shotgun and give himself up after his shooting rampage left two of his classmates fighting for their lives. The 7th grader walked into a packed gymnasium at the beginning of the school day on Tuesday and opened fire at his classmates, leaving an 11-year-old boy fighting for his life and a 13-year-old girl, named as Kendal Sanders, in serious condition.

After the first shots rang out, Masterson was quick to react, throwing . himself towards the armed youngster and convincing him to lay his . shotgun on the ground. 'Mr. Masterson ... was a hero ...who stood there and allowed a gun to be pointed right at him,' New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez said at a vigil Tuesday evening, according to CNN, 'and to talk down that young boy to drop the gun so that there would be no more young kids hurt.' Mr Masterson has been a teacher for ten years and also coaches soccer at the school. He told the Albuquerque Journal he was warned not to speak at length about the shooting but spoke of his horror. 'It was a harrowing experience. All I can say was the staff there did a great job,' he said. The . two victims were first taken to Eastern New Mexico Medical Center and . then airlifted to the University of Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, . where the unidentified 11-year-old boy reportedly told nurses he was the target of the . shocking . spray of bullets. A teacher also suffered minor injuries but refused medical aid so he could stay on to assist at the scene. Kendal Sanders was initially classed as critical after being shot in the arm but has improved so she is classified as in a serious condition today.

Roswell police announced soon after the shooting that the suspect had been arrested at the campus and was in custody. At the press conference, New Mexico state police chief Pete N. Kassetas said the drama unfolded at the school around 7:30 a.m. '(The suspect) walked into the gymnasium. We believe the weapon was concealed in a bag and it wasn't known about until right before he started shooting,' he said. Witnesses said the 11-year-old victim was shot in the face, though officials refused to confirm this. Kassetas said the school's principal recognized a NM state police lieutenant who was dropping off his own child as she locked the door and asked for his help. However, when he arrived inside the gym, the weapon was already on the ground. He went on to applaud the bravery of school officials. 'It is one thing for a police officer whose job this is to intervene but for a teacher or staff member to intervene, I commend the principal and the teachers and people at this school for saving many more lives,' he said. Too much: A parent falls to their knees as they hear more about the early morning shooting . Police: Police were on hand at the chaotic parking lot as frightened parents waited for their children . Kassetas said detectives were conducting interviews with over 100 students and faculty as part of the investigation but they were confident the 12-year-old was acting alone. He didn't know a motive at this stage and said officers had been in touch with the parents of the suspected shooter and both victims. Superintendent Burris insisted security at his schools was not to blame and said the incident came as a total shock to all. 'We come to school daily thinking we are going to educate our kids and lead them but we never think things like today will ever happen,' he said. 'And they do.' Roswell Mayor Jere Wood told reporters he was devastated by the news and called for an end to such senseless acts of violence. 'We were saddened when we heard of the shooting we were saddened for the victims and their injuries and the hurt it has brought to the community of Roswell,' he said, offering up any resources the ISD required for things like counseling. Earlier, Gabriel Tortillo, a 7th grade student at Berrendo, told the Albuquerque Journal he saw a male student carrying a gun. He said that student shot a boy in the eye area. Sixth grade student Anyssa Vegara said she was talking to a security guard when she heard the shot. 'I turned around and all I saw was someone on the floor with their arm bleeding,' the student said.

Fast food is not to blame for childhood obesity, poor eating habits learned in children's home are, says a new study conducted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The study entitled, 'The Association of Fast Food Consumption with Poor Dietary Outcomes and Obesity Among Children: is it The Fast Food of the Remainder of the Diet?' was lead by Barry Popkin, the W.R Kenan Jr. Distinguished Professor of Nutrition at UNC's Gillings School of Public Health and was publsihed in the latest issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Researchers for the study found that while fast food does contribute to unhealthy children, the main culprit for childhood obesity is learned dietary habits children observe at home. Science Daily reports that the poor eating patterns consist of drinking sugary drinks and eating processed foods as oppose to eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Even though fast food is unhealthy and contributes to childhood obesity, eating healthy is a learned skill that starts in the home . The UNC School of Public health researched the relationship between a fast food diet and calories gained elsewhere and found that children also eat unhealthily at school and at home . Not only are these bad habits observed at home, they are enforced in schools that lack healthy food options. 'This is really what is driving children's obesity,' said Popkin. 'Eating fast foods is just one behavior that results from those bad habits. Just because children who eat more fast food are the most likely to become obese does not prove that calories from fast foods bear the brunt of the blame.' The study observed data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Survey between 2007 and 2010. Researchers looked at the diets of 4,466 children aged 2-18. They looked at whether they ate at fast food restaurants or if they ate somewhere else. The children were then placed in groups based on how much calorie intake they consumed from fast food restaurants. 50 per cent of the children were non consumers of fast food. 40 per cent were low consumers who gained 30 per cent of their calorie intake from fast foods. 10 per cent of the children were high consumers who gained more than 30 per cent of their calories from fast food. The study was lead by Barry Popkin, the the W.R Kenan Jr. Distinguished Professor of Nutrition at UNC's Gillings School of Public Health . Kids learn from their parents: Children often eat a diet low in fruits and vegetables because their parents don't take the time to cook healthy meals for them . After separtaing the children into groups and observing their calrie intake, researchers attempted to discover what aspects of childrens diets made them more susceptible to childhood obesity and why. What they found was that health goes beyond where children eat, it's why they eat there, and what sorts of eating habits they observe in their families. 'The study presented strong evidence that the children's diet beyond fast- food consumption is more strongly linked to poor nutrition and obesity,' said Jennifer Poti, doctoral candidate in UNC's Department of Nutrition and co-author of the study. 'While reducing fast-food intake is important, the rest of a child's diet should not be overlooked.' Furthermore, Popkin said that taking the time to enforce healthy eating habits from a young age will lead children to become healthier adults. 'Children who rely on fast foods may tend to have parents who do not have the means, desire or time to purchase or prepare healthy foods at home,' Popkin said. 'This is really what is driving children's obesity and what needs to be addressed in any solution.' According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity has more than doubled in Children and more than tripled in adolescents in the last 30 years. The CDC's tips on obesity prevention supports the importance of families and schools in impacting children's dietary decisions. They say that, 'The dietary and physical activity behaviors of children and adolescents are influenced by many sectors of society, including families, communities, schools, child care settings, medical care providers, faith-based institutions, government agencies, the media, and the food and beverage industries and entertainment industries.' Childhood obesity is on the rise and parents are the ones to blame .","A study conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that poor eating habits linked to obesity are learned in children's homes .

Asian Americans--specifically young Asian American women-- are the least likely to be overweight, reveals recent data from The Centers for Disease control and Prevention. But just because Asians are the slimmest, doesn't mean that they are less likely to suffer from hypertension or other diseases, says the CDC. The data is based off of Asian American Volunteers who participated in the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2011-2012.Previously to the study there had been a 'scarcity' of health information about the minority group. Asian Americans are younger and thinner than other American racial groups . 66.7 per cent of white Americans are overweight compared to only 38.6 of Asian Americans . Asian Americans had the lowest BMI when compared to other groups . The survey found only 38.6 per cent of Asian American adults have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of over 25. A BMI of 25 or older is the signifier of being overweight, reports the L.A. Times. The amount of Caucasian and Latinos was astonishingly high at 66.7 per cent overweight for whites, and 78.8 per cent overweight for Hispanics. Some Asians are heavier than others. Asian men are more likely to be overweight than Asian women. 43 per cent of men have a BMI of over 25 as oppose to 34.7 per cent of women. Data from the CDC also shows that Americans over the age of 40 are more likely to be overweight than Americans aged 20-39. Even though Asian's are thinner than other Americans, their total high cholesterol was 'similar' to other American adults at 10.3 per cent. Asian's cholesterol was about the same when compared to other groups . Hispanics had higher levels of 'good' cholesterol (HDL) than the  Asians did at 21.8 per cent versus 14.3 per cent. Asians may be thinner than whites and Latinos, but they have around the same chance of having hypertension at 26.6 per cent. Non-Hispanic African Americans had the highest prevalence of hyper tension at 42.1 per cent. The LA Times reports that 1 in 20 American are Asian Americans and Asian qualifies as anyone from Chinese, Asian Indian, Korean, Philippine, or Vietnamese origin. There are 15.4 million Asians in the United States and that figure has increase 40 per cent since 2000. One of the reasons Asians may be skinniest is because Asians tend to be younger than most Caucasian Americans. 43.6 per cent of the Asian population is between the ages of 20 and 39. 19.3 per cent of Asians are over 60 years old compared with 31.4 per cent and 30 per Cent for whites. Even though Asians are slim they can still be prone to hypertension . Regardless of weight, the cholesterol of Asians was about the same as whites and Hispanics but lower than African Americans . Asians are younger than Caucasian Americans and may be why they are so thin .","Only 38.6 per cent of Asian Americans are overweight compared to 66.7 per cent of whites and 78.8 per cent for Hispanics .
Younger people are more likely to be thinner than older people and since Asian Americans are a young minority in America, that could account for their slimness .

Police are hunting for the thugs that gunned down a five-year-old girl when a stray bullet from a drive by shooting struck her while she ate breakfast. Payton Benson was the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting Thursday morning around 9:45 a.m. that saw three men unload at least 20 shots into a residential block in Omaha. She died at a local hospital. The young girl is the nephew of Omaha City Councilman Ben Gray, according to WOWT. Her family had recently moved to Omaha from Illinois. Senseless: Payton Benson, 5, died after a stray bullet from a drive-by shooting struck her as she ate breakfast . ‘It makes me so mad right now,’ uncle Massey Allen told WOWT. ‘I’m going to keep it real with you, I want to go kill somebody my damn self, that’s how mad I am. She didn’t even start school yet.’ Ms Benson was finishing breakfast when the thugs began shooting at a man on the street only a block away, according to police. Witnesses told WOWT they heard at least 20 shots fired from multiple high-powered rifles. ‘What I heard was just massive amounts of gunfire, both guns had to be completely unloaded,’ Nick Todd told WOWT.  ‘Both guns were very large guns. They weren't small guns.’ Even worse, the family’s van had a flat tire after being struck by a separate stray bullet – Ms Benson’s mother could not get her to the hospital in time to possibly save her life. The suspects: Police are hunting for these three men, and have urged them to turn themselves in . The getaway: Cops believe the men sped away in this vehicle . Angry relative: Uncle Allen Massey said he's so mad he 'ready to kill someone' after his young niece was shot dead . Footage from the scene showed several evidence markers scattered around the street where investigators found dozens of shell casings. Surveillance footage released from nearby showed three men exiting a black SUV police believe are the gunmen. ‘Your loss is our community's loss,’ Mayor Jean Stothert said during a Thursday news conference, according to KETV. Police then urged the gunmen to turn themselves in. ‘You know who you are and law enforcement will find out who you are,’ Chief Todd Schmaderer said. ‘It may not have been your bullet that struck this is girl, so do the right thing and do yourself a favor in the process.’ Bullet-riddled: Evidence markers indicate whee police found shell casings, there were dozens of shots fired . Callous: the stray bullets even flattened the tires of the family van, making it impossible to rush the dying girl to the hospital . On the scene: Investigators combing the neighborhood for evidence . The Chief also vowed to make finding young Payton’s killers the department’s top priority. ‘I promise the family, this community, that my homicide investigators, my gang investigators will work around the clock leaving no stone unturned,’ he added. Mr Schmaderer also said there are several leads in the case, that it’s solvable and that his team will ‘work it extremely hard.’ The Fontenelle Park neighborhood, where the shootings occurred, is not a particularly violent area. There are only 4 violent crimes per 1,000 residents, according to the Omaha World-Herald.","Payton Benson, 5, was not the intended target of the drive-by shooting .

Pochettino's future was thrown into doubt when executive chairman Nicola Cortese walked away from the club following a bitter dispute with Liebherr. Saints faced the possibility of manager Pochettino, who has steered them to ninth in the Premier League, and a host of star players following Cortese out the door. Staying: Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino greets a member of staff before his press conference . He's in not out: Pochettino walks into his press conference after saying he will remain at St Mary's . Gutted: Luke Shaw, arriving for training on Thursday, was upset at Cortese's departure . Hello and goodbye? Rickie Lambert (left) is a £7m target for West Ham . But the Argentine said: 'First of all I . want to show my complete gratitude to Nicola Cortese. He believed in me . and my staff and our families are full of gratitude. ‘Eight . months ago when we were speaking about things I said there would be no . sense for me to stay but it is completely different now. It is a . different situation now. Nicola knows about my decision to stay. ‘This . club is a society and there is no sense to change. I will be here on . Saturday and beyond. I have spoken with Katharina for five minutes . today. 'She has told me I . have her trust. We have spoken briefly to say 'hi' and she said I have her . full support. We have had no time to talk about other things. 'She told me we have her full support and . to be stable. Now we have to look to the future. 'It is too hard to say if I will be here in 17 months - but I am 100 per cent committed to the contract and I have a responsibility to the players and to the project.' Next move: Mauricio Pochettino is staying put at Southampton after talks with Katharina Liebherr . Cortese quit after Liebherr, who . inherited the club when her father Markus died in 2010, demanded a . bigger say in the running of Southampton. He resigned just after 7pm on Wednesday, shortly . after he had persuaded Pochettino to remain in charge . of the team for the clash with Sunderland on Saturday.

Dejan Lovren on Twiter: 'Thank you Nicola Cortese for everything #respect.' There . are now widespread fears among staff at Southampton that Liebherr, who . has no previous experience of running a football club, will decide to . sell. She has appointed . herself non-executive chairman and released a statement to say that the . process to find a chief executive to run the business had already . started. Incredibly, Cortese was locked in talks with West Ham over the £7million sale of Lambert. Cortese . and Lambert were scheduled to meet at the club’s Marchwood . training centre, but that has been cancelled following the Italian's resignation. End of an era: The club have accepted the resignation of Cortese . Lambert, . who has a restricted role in the first team, fears his World Cup hopes . will be in jeopardy if he does not get regular football. West Ham are unwilling to meet his £70,000-a-week wage demands but are still keen to sign him. Some . of Southampton’s players are furious with developments and a number of . the prominent members of the squad will consider their positions in the . wake of Cortese’s departure. There . has been an odd atmosphere at training following the latest . developments on the south coast and Pochettino changed a session on . Wednesday when players were not responding. He added: 'I was very surprised to see Nicola leave and the players were surprised. It is a distraction from the game (on Saturday against Sunderland). We are professional but we are also human. We have relationships but we just need to think about the game on Saturday. 'I am sure the club will designate someone to listen to potential offers, but I want to make it clear no-one is for sale.' Man in the middle: Rickie Lambert (front) has hit seven goals this term, despite not being first-choice . World Cup hopes: Lambert (front) has seen his first team opportunities limited at Southampton . Luke Shaw, who decided to stay last summer despite interest from Chelsea, is wanted by Manchester City and Liverpool. Liebherr values him at an astonishing £30m and will sell if a club comes in with a bid. Shaw . tweeted: ‘Gutted with that news, but would just like to thank Nicola . Cortese for everything he has done for me and the club! All the best to . him!’ James Ward-Prowse . and Calum Chambers, two of the biggest talents to come through the . club’s academy, will be targeted by top teams. Authority: Katharina Lieberr, the new non-executive chairman of Southampton, at St Mary's . Relationship: Skipper Adam Lallana talking with Pochettino on the training ground last week . Liebherr said: ‘With great regret we have accepted the resignation of Mr Cortese. ‘He has done a wonderful job at the club and we very much wanted him to stay. A search has now begun for a successor. ‘In . the meantime, it is business as usual and we will ensure that the . manager, the team and all the staff at the club have all the help and . support they need.’ Better than expected: Southampton currently sit in nine points after a terrific first half of the season . Potential: England youngsters such as Luke Shaw (pictured) has made Southampton an example of how to integrate talent from a club's youth system into the first team . That . has finally happened after Liebherr informed Cortese at the end of last . year that she intended to have more say in running the club. Cortese, . who was retained as executive chairman by the trust when Markus . Liebherr died, had previously resisted her attempts to take a bigger . role. The Italian . banker, who said goodbye to staff before loading his car with his . possessions and departing, wanted more investment to fulfil the ambition . of playing Champions League football.","Mauricio Pochettino's future was in doubt after Nicola Cortese quit .

Authorities say an Indiana dog breeder whose minivan broke down in central Ohio was transporting 62 dogs, some four or five to a crate. Licking County Humane Society Executive Director Lori Carlson says the animals were stacked 'bottom to top' in the van when it was discovered in the parking lot of a hotel in Hebron, east of Columbus, on Saturday afternoon. Carlson said the dogs, some just a few weeks old, had coats covered with feces and urine. Cruelty: An Indiana dog breeder whose minivan broke down in Licking County was caught transporting 62 dogs, some just a few weeks old . Cramped conditions: The breeder said he was taking 50 dogs and 12 puppies from Country Boys Pets in Indiana to an animal rescue New Jersey . Humane Agent Paula Evans was the second on the scene Saturday afternoon and said, 'In one kennel alone was a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, a Rottweiler, a Lab and then another large dog.' The breeder said he was taking 50 dogs and 12 puppies from Country Boys Pets in Indiana to an animal rescue New Jersey. 'By the time we got them into our care, it had almost been 24 hours that they had been in the van,' said Carlson. The breeder has been named as Country Boys Pets owner Jonas Fisher, who runs a dog breeding facility. He may now be facing some serious charges over how his operation is run. Rescued: The Licking County Dog Shelter was already filled with dogs, but workers created a makeshift kennel in the multi-purpose room and began feeding and caring for the dogs . Freedom: Many of the dogs slept, some jumped, not used to having all the space to move around and stretch their legs . This isn't the first time Fisher has been reprimanded over his practices. United States Department of Agriculture documents detail three visits by the USDA over the past three years. Then, last August agents reported undocumented dogs, discovered that five shipments of puppies were weaned early and shipped too young, and that 47 dogs and puppies were being held in enclosures that were too small. And now, agents say they found a van load of Country Boys Breeder dogs and puppies in bad shape. The minivan broke down and was found in the parking lot of a Licking County hotel. According to Carlson, a hotel worker saw the dogs and contacted the sheriff. Help at hand: Community members have started dropping of donations of small breed dog food and puppy pads to try and change that . Deplorable: Some of the dogs sustained cuts and scratches from being trapped in close quarters with one another. One puppy was sick with pneumonia. Many were covered in feces and urine . Twenty-five of the dogs were taken by a mobile animal rescue crew from New York. The rest went to the Licking County Animal Shelter. There, you could see some of the dogs sustained cuts and scratches from being trapped in close quarters with one another. One puppy was sick with pneumonia. 'Filthy coats.. A lot of feces, covered, urine soaked,' Carlson said. The Licking County Dog Shelter was already filled with dogs, but workers created a makeshift kennel in the multi-purpose room and began feeding and caring for the dogs. Many of the dogs slept, some jumped, not used to having all the space to move around and stretch their legs. The driver reported being hired by the breeder to take the 50 adult dogs and 12 puppies to an animal rescue in New Jersey. They now are in Ohio animal shelters. The county prosecutor's office will consider charges in the case. Shocking: For hours, the dogs traveled four to five dogs per crate - some were just a few weeks old . Community members have started dropping of donations of small breed dog food and puppy pads to try and change that. A veterinarian will screen the dogs and give them shots.

Two senior ministers in Tony Blair’s government are facing a possible criminal probe over the alleged torture and unlawful killing of hundreds of Iraqis by British soldiers. Former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and ex-Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram have been named in an application to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate claims of abuse in Iraq from 2003 to 2008. Lawyers representing Iraqi victims have submitted a 250-page dossier to the ICC, including at least 1,200 allegations of war crimes,  based on witness statements  and evidence from the International Committee of  the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations. Former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon (left) and former Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram (right) are accused in the dossier of failing to do enough to prevent 1,000 torture cases and 200 of unlawful killing . The application calls for an investigation to be opened into the crimes and the apparent  role of senior British officials, ‘in particular Geoff Hoon and Adam Ingram’. Last night, Phil Shiner, of Public Interest Lawyers, said: ‘We have got over a thousand cases of torture and about 200 cases of unlawful killings, many of them took place in custody. ‘Every way you look at it this points to the very top, and that means Geoff Hoon and others.’ The application, presented to the ICC at its headquarters in The Hague on Friday, accuses Mr Hoon and Mr Ingram of failing to prevent British troops mishandling prisoners and using outlawed interrogation techniques. Mr Hoon and Mr Ingram were unavailable for comment last night, but an MoD spokesman said ICC action was unnecessary because matters are being investigated by the Government. They added: ‘We reject the suggestion that the UK’s Armed Forces, who operate in line  with domestic and international law, Have systematically tortured detainees.’ Dossier: A application has been made to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, pictured .","Former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon is named alongside ex-Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram in dossier to International Criminal Court .

A grandfather held a Filipina woman in near-seclusion as she worked as a maid, landscaper, nanny and cook at his family's multiple properties for a pitiful wage, prosecutors have claimed. Romulo 'Ome' Almeda Sr., 73, has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the case but now faces five years of federal supervision for employing the immigrant worker unlawfully. Almeda, who lives in Magnolia, Seattle, allegedly paid the woman just $400 a month while she worked for his family for four years - shorting her of $90,500 that he has now paid her in back wages. Authorities began investigating Almeda, a married grandfather and retired electrical engineer, after the unidentified woman managed to escape the family with the help of a local pastor. Held in seclusion: A Filipina woman worked as a maid, gardener, cook and nanny for a family for just $400 a month. She was ferried between their homes  (one is pictured) in Washington and California . Almeda moved to the U.S. after meeting a client at her $6-a-day manicurist job in the Philippines who told her they could get her better-paying work in the U.S, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported. She obtained a visitor's visa and flew to Seattle to work for Almeda - but it was far from the better life she'd imagined, prosecutors said. In the subsequent years, she lived in near-seclusion as she worked 12 to 16 hours a day for $400 a month - far below the minimum wage. She sent it all but $50 to $100 back to the Philippines. She would look after the family's children, carry out gardening, laundry and cleaning, and cook the family's meals, prosecutors said. She was ferried between the family's Washington and California homes - never being given a choice about when she would be moved. As she did not hold a valid visa, the . woman was unable to leave the homes, and could not even attend church in . case she would be seen and deported, prosecutors said. Fears: Another of the family's Seattle properties is pictured. The woman was only able to escape the family after her family members contacted a local pastor, who removed her from the home in 2009 . The woman was eventually able to tell her family about her dire living situation and her sister contacted another Filipino family in Seattle, who got in touch with a local pastor. The pastor helped remove the woman from the home in April 2009. Almeda was arrested - but he said he believed he was simply helping the woman and her family. 'At the time, I thought I was simply offering my home and extra money to someone who had no place to go,' Almeda said in a letter to the court. 'I now know what I did was wrong and unlawful.' He was charged in September and reached a plea agreement with prosecutors. He has not been jailed and is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday.","Romulo Almeda Sr. shorted the woman of $90,500 over 4 years .

A woman drunkenly punched her aunt in the face at a family barbecue because she thought she was a zombie, a court has heard. Joanne Waite, of Workington, Cumbria, allegedly launched the attack on Eleanor Huddart, 69, after she 'mistook her for the living dead'. Mrs Huddart, who was also allegedly attacked by her husband on the same evening, was left with a fractured eye socket and severe bruising after the eventful barbecue. Waite, 44, told Carlisle Crown Court . that she was acting in self defence when she hit her aunt across the . face after drinking - because she didn't think she was a real person. The . court heard that in a statement to police following the incident, Waite . said: 'It was walking slowly. It looked like a 1970s zombie type of . thing. 'Is this real? Is this real? Am I really seeing someone with blood all over her face? It was walking towards me.' She . also allegedly claimed she 'didn't know it was a person', before adding . that she remembered punching Huddart 'to get her off us'. Tim .

The court heard how Waite had been drinking at the family barbecue, which was held at Mrs Huddart's home in July last year, and how at the end of night the only people left were Waite and the Huddarts. Mr Evans told the jury there was an argument at the end of the night between Mr and Mrs Huddart, which allegedly resulted in him attacking his wife.

The extent to which mobile phones act as ‘spies in our pockets’ has been exposed  by a senior Tory MP. Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis discovered how closely we can be watched when he asked his phone provider for the information it held on him – and found it could track his every move. Mr Davis investigated after American whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the security services were forcing phone companies to hand over  data on their customers. The campaigning MP, who writes about his discoveries in today’s Mail on Sunday, says the list of times and  co-ordinates – known as metadata – showed ‘where  I had been at any one time for a year’. It was so detailed that Mr Davis was able to plot out his movements over a day. The one he chose was during last year’s party conference in Manchester, and the data mapped his meetings with members of the public, journalists and parliamentary colleagues. ‘I could see exactly where  I had been at pretty much every point of the day,’ writes Mr Davis. ‘So in conjunction with those people’s phone records, the data would show everybody I met that day.’ Mr Davis has been an opponent of efforts by Home Secretary Theresa May to introduce a ‘snooper’s charter’ extending the State’s power  to monitor communications. Sinister: Mr Davis found that metadata collected by phone firms tracked his exact location and movements . He added: ‘The State rarely asks for information which isn’t of use to it. With this metadata they can learn as much about me as they can by reading my emails or eavesdropping on my calls. ‘Since the Snowden revelations, we know that  our security services have engaged in legally dubious monitoring of our metadata. ‘We know that they, along with many Ministers, want the legal power to do this on an even bigger scale. ‘This has serious implications for our privacy.’","David Davis investigated the true nature of mobile phone 'metadata'

The whirring of the milk float and chinking of the bottles used to be a sound as much a part of a morning as the dawn chorus of songbirds. But one dairy that was a victim to the rise of the supermarkets has ensured that a vivid picture of the old tradition remains by keeping detailed records and nostalgic photographs of their business. The archives of Thompson's Dairies of Beverley preserve the cherished memories that have faded from our minds, showing pictures of old milk floats and a daily log of deliveries made to schools in the region. Doing the rounds: A milk-man gets ready to deliver the bottles to the doorstep. The tradition might be a thing of the past but the archives of the Thompson Dairy in Beverley, East Yorkshire, are preserving the memories . The records document the activities of the dairy, based in East Yorkshire, from the 1940s to the early 1990s, painting a picture of a time where levels of trust were so much higher that doors weren't locked and money was left on the top of the fridge. They are held by the council of East Riding which has made them available to the public. Sales records reveal exactly what was sold by the business on a weekly basis, including non-dairy products like fruit juice and bread. Delivering milk for a century: The flier (pictured left) from 1982 celebrated the 100 year anniversary of the Thompson Dairy's service to the east Riding towns of Beverley, Cottingham, Walkington and Newbald and (right) one of the workers shows bottles ready for the float . Mark Thompson, one of four brothers . involved in the business, remembers parents Raymond and June going out . twice a day on a horse and cart to deliver milk in Beverley when he was . just three. 'They'd be up at 3am leaving us in bed and they'd be back at 7am,' he said. 'You . had to do it twice a day in those days as milk wasn't pasteurised then. By the time it got to tea-time it was on its way out.' After the horse and cart - the horse Kate was grazed on Hall Garth opposite Beverley Minster - came electrical milk floats in their familiar green and cream livery. A proud tradition: The four Thompson brothers are pictured with their father Raymond (centre) in 1982. He is remembered by them as 'a stickler for work' Quality control: An employee in the Figham Road dairy is pictured in the 1980s inspecting the milk before it was taken out on the rounds in East Yorkshire. The Thompson Dairy ceased business in 1992 . East Riding towns Beverley, . Cottingham, Walkington and Newbald were all part of the Thompson . territory, whch expanded to include Pocklington and villages like . Everingham, when they bought Jacksons Dairy. Youngest brother Quentin Thomas remembers times when levels of trust were far higher. 'In . Everingham people would be out to work on the fields. Doors weren't . locked and you would go into the kitchen and the money would be on top . of the fridge,' he said. 'There . would be money for the butcher, the fishmonger and the milkman, all in . separate heaps. You would look in the fridge and see how much milk there . was.' The life of a dairy:  Records from the Thomspon's Dairy (pictured left) and photographs dating as far back as the 1940s tell the story of the East Yorkshire family business through the decades. The owner, Raymond Thompson, is pictured standing proudly on one of his milk floats in the 1960s . Thompsons Dairies was first . established in 1882 as a small-scale operation in the yard of 97 . Keldgate, Beverley. It later grew to become the chief supplier of milk . and other dairy products in the Beverley area and was a strong . competitor to Dale Farm - which it eventually sold out to a century . later. Every member of the . family had their role - Raymond, a stickler for work - oversaw the milk . testing, public health and customer care, Andrew was on production and . packaging, Mark would organise staff, Geoffrey, office and accounts and . Quentin vehicle maintenance. They had 16 rounds at Beverley, eight at Pocklington and five of school milk until Margaret Thatcher stopped it in the 1970s. A piece of history: A horse and cart was initially used to deliver the milk but in the 1950s Raymond Thompson bought his first electric milk float (pictured) Carrying the load: One of the dairy's workers, Fred Gollagher, is pictured with crates of milk bottles ready for delivery . Ready for business: Emma Carr (pictured) was an employee of Thompson's Dairy in the 1960s. They delivered to Riding towns including Beverley, Cottingham, Walkington and Newbald . A detailed history: Collections officer Sam Bartle (pictured right) hold photographs from the archive which also includes a milkman's ledger (pictured left) listing all the deliveries on his round . Hull wasn't their traditional ground - people still like their 'steri', sterilised milk, whereas Beverley was a firmly fat silver-top town. The fad for dieting led to a whole new range of skimmed milk being produced at the dairy - a reverse of the situation just a few years previously where there was no demand for milk with the cream skimmed off and it had to be fed to the pigs. When Raymond retired, new rules which required a £2m upgrade of their dairy in Figham and falling profit margins due to customers switching to supermarket milk, were all factors in the decision to sell up. A family business: The Thompson's Dairy was founded in 1882 and ran for more than 100 years. Raymond's brother Jack Thompson is pictured in the late 1940s .

Housing the milk: The Keldgate dairy is pictured in the 1970s. Raymond Thompson's business expanded to include Pocklington and villages like Everingham, when they bought Jacksons Dairy . Quentin added: 'The customer base was disappearing rapidly, it was a change in lifestyles. People were mortgaged up and interest rates were going up and instead of the wife being at home she was going out to work. 'She didn't want the bottle on the doorstep going sour, they wanted a supermarket for convenience and it was getting cheaper. 'We were doing four pint jugs at £1.10 - it doesn't cost that much to buy 20 years on. The dairy farmers have had a raw deal I would say.' The business ceased trading in 1992, but its memory will live on in the archives. Sam Bartle, collections officer at East Riding Archives and Local Studies Service, said: 'As generations come and go, these archives will act as a reminder of the days of the milkman, and teach us about what was once a way of life for millions.'","Thompson's Dairies was first established in 1882 as a small-scale operation in Beverley, Yorkshire .

Andy Murray could step into the shoes, or rather underpants of David Beckham, after trademarking boxer shorts and lingerie bearing his name. The Wimbledon champion has registered his name as a trademark with the  Intellectual Property Office (IPO), which will cover branded knickers, suspenders, boxer shorts, socks and dresses. However, Murray fans hoping the tennis ace is about to launch his own underwear brand, as Beckham did last year with H&M, are set for disappointment as the sportsman is thought to have made the move to stop others cashing in on his fame with unlicensed merchandise. Net profit: Wimbledon Champion Andy Murray has trademarked his name, including on items such as lingerie, suspenders and boxer shorts . Murray's trademark covers more than 100 items, including computer games, sportswear, DVDs and stationary, as well as more unusual items such as Halloween costumes, greetings cards, toy dolls, slippers, bath toys, roller skates, colouring books, paddling pools and surf boards. Although Murray's team say he is unlikely to bring out his own lingerie line, the trademark will prevent others from doing so. 'It's unlikely he'll make millions . selling sexy bras with 'Andy Murray' written on them but who knows? With . this trademark being approved it means that he could if he ever wanted . to,' a source told The Sun. In action: Murray takes to the court during the Australian Open this week. Although his team say he is unlikely to bring out his own underwear range, the trademark will prevent others from doing so . Safeguards: The trademark will also protect firms who have signed a deal with the sportsman to sell items bearing his name - including Adidas . Computer games . Mobile telephone covers . Sunglasses . Colouring books . Pencils . All purpose sports bags . Umbrellas . Articles of sports clothing . Sports footwear and sports headgear . Raincoats . Cloth bibs . Dresses . Suspenders . Slippers . Underwear . Lingerie . Halloween costumes . Sporting balls . Rackets . Trampolines . Teddy bears . Skateboards . The application to the IPO from Murray's new company 77 Management Limited, comes after a number of other attempts to trademark his name were made by others unconnected to the tennis ace. There had already been attempts made to trademark 'Andy Murray', 'Andy Murray Wimbledon Winner', and 'Andy Murray Tennis Champion'. It was rubber stamped on Boxing Day after no objections to the trademark were received. The reigning BBC Sports Personality of . the Year's move is understood to be part of a plan by his management . team to turn him into a global brand, with other stars who have . successful trademarked their names, including David and Victoria Beckham. Murray's tennis rival Roger Federer successfully trademarked the logo of his RF brand. And Real Madrid footballer Gareth Bale has trademarked his heart-shaped goal celebration as a logo. David Potter, the head of trademarks legal team at Harrison Goddard Foote, who handled Murray's application, said the trademark would stop goods being produced under Murray's brand without permission. The trademark will also protect firms who have signed a deal with the sportsman to sell items bearing his name - including Adidas, Head rackets, and water company Highland Spring. 'It gives the person the legal monopoly over their own name to stop counterfeit use, and to be able to licence the name to third parties,' he said.

Katy Holmes, 33, was caught in the act with a stranger on the bonnet of a red Peugeot in a quiet cul-de-sac in Blackpool, Lancashire. Single Holmes escaped jail for her involvement in the . lewd offence which occurred at around 9.45am after she met the stranger while buying a bottle . of water from a nearby shop. Following the incident in December last year, Holmes told police: 'The man started flirting with me. We had met at . the newsagents. I was on the way home. 'What happened was consensual - but I accept people who saw what was going on might think it lewd and offensive.' However, a disgusted mother spotted the seedy rendezvous while with her young child and immediately called the police. Don Green, prosecuting at Blackpool Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, said: 'A witness saw what was going on through the front window of her home. 'Holmes was smiling and laughing and appeared to be enjoying what was going on.' When officers arrived in the quiet cul-de-sac in Blackpool where the offence took place, the man fled by scaling a metal fence. An officer caught his ankles but he kicked out and escaped. Holmes, who cried throughout her court hearing, admitted committing an act outraging public decency by behaving in an indecent manner. The seedy offence took place on the quiet Hyde Road in Blackpool, Lancashire, at around 9.45am on a December morning last year. Holmes told police she had met the man just minutes before . Steven Townley, defending, said: 'This is an unusual offence which is a difficult case to sentence. 'She has no convictions for any similar offences. 'It is just something which happened on the spur of the moment - something she regrets.' Holmes was sentenced to an eight week prison term suspended for 12 months. She was also given 12 months supervision. Chairman of the bench Stephen Musgrave said: 'This offence took place in public, in the day time and there were children present.

Immigration staff have been condemned for a ‘lack of humanity’ over their treatment of an 84-year-old Alzheimer’s sufferer who died while shackled in handcuffs. Alois Dvorzac was suffering from severe dementia when he was stopped trying to enter the UK at Gatwick airport last January. A doctor who examined the Canadian wrote in his records: ‘Frail, 84 yrs old, has Alzheimer’s disease … demented. UNFIT for detention or deportation. Requires social care’. But he was still sent to Harmondsworth immigration detention centre where arrangements were made to have him deported. These plans were scrapped when a doctor declared the man unfit to fly and, a few days later, he was taken to hospital in handcuffs – which were kept on for five hours after his admission. Only after his heart had stopped and cardiopulmonary resuscitation started were the restraints removed. It was just one of a string of examples, uncovered by Her Majesty’s Inspector of Prisons, of the gravely ill being forced by border staff to wear restraints. Other cases included a detainee who was wheelchair bound following a stroke but was handcuffed on a journey to hospital ‘for no obvious reason’. One dying man remained handcuffed while sedated and undergoing an angioplasty procedure in hospital. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ‘Have the authorities responsible for Harmondsworth forgotten the basic principles of humanity and decency that must apply to any form of custody?’ Ministers have vowed to scrutinise more closely the performance of Harmondsworth contractor GEO, which also runs Dungavel House immigration removal centre in South Lanarkshire. Removal centres are used for temporary detention in situations where people have no legal right to be in the UK but have refused to leave voluntarily. The man was sent to Harmondsworth immigration detention centre where arrangements were being made for his deportation . Elsewhere in the report, inspectors said 11 detainees had been held at Harmondsworth for more than a year, including a man who had been held for almost two-and-a-half years, despite being willing to return to his country. The man had lost contact with his family, so was unable to establish proof of identity. HMIP described some of the rooms at the 600-capacity detention centre next to Heathrow as overcrowded, dirty and bleak. Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said some of the most vulnerable detainees ‘had been utterly failed by the system’. On at least two occasions, inspectors discovered elderly, vulnerable and incapacitated detainees were ‘needlessly handcuffed in an excessive and unacceptable manner’. Inspectors warned insufficient weight was given to doctors’ opinions as to fitness for detention.The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is preparing to investigate the incident involving Mr Dvorzac but is awaiting confirmation of the cause of death. Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘The use of restraint in this case seems completely unjustified and must not be repeated.’ He added: ‘Clearly, performance by the contractor running Harmondsworth has been below the high standard expected.’","Alois Dvorzac was stopped trying to enter the UK last January .

Middle-aged men risk a faster mental decline as they age if they've been drinking heavily for years, new research suggests. The study of about 5,000 British civil servants found that over a decade, the added decline was the equivalent of about two extra years of aging for a combined measure of mental abilities like reasoning, and about six years for memory. The heavy drinkers' abilities were compared to those of men who drank moderately or abstained. The study of about 5,000 British civil servants found that over a decade, the added decline was the equivalent of about two extra years of aging for a combined measure of mental abilities like reasoning, and about six years for memory . The study is one of the first to focus on middle aged drinkers. The work was published online Wednesday by the journal Neurology. Researchers found no such effect in women, but the study included too few female heavy drinkers to test the effect of drinking the same amount as in men, said Severine Sabia, a study author from University College London. In an email, she said it was not possible to identify a specific minimum level of consumption at which the risk begins in men. Her study used data from over 20 years. Using questionnaires, researchers calculated the men's average daily intake of alcohol for the decade up to when they were an average of 56 years old. Then, they tracked decline in mental abilities over the following decade from tests administered every five years. Accelerated decline was seen for the heaviest-drinking group, which included 469 men with a wide range of alcohol intake. The minimum amount was the equivalent of about 13 ounces of wine a day or about 30 ounces of beer. The maximum was about three times that. Experts say the study 'does suggest that middle-aged to young-old individuals do need to pay attention to what their drinking habits have been, and are.' Men drinking that minimum amount are not necessarily at risk for accelerated mental decline, since the results pertain to the category overall, said Sara Jo Nixon, a substance abuse researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville, who did not participate in the work. She also said that the study shows a link between drinking and faster mental decline but not proof that alcohol intake was responsible. And she said that because of the sensitive mental tests used in the study, the extra declines in performance may be too subtle to make a difference in daily life. Sabia said she believed the difference would eventually be noticeable. Still, Nixon said, the study 'does suggest that middle-aged to young-old individuals do need to pay attention to what their drinking habits have been, and are.'","Over a decade, the added decline was the equivalent of about two extra years of aging .

A pensioner who left a dying pony propped up against a car tyre has been jailed for what is his fifth animal cruelty conviction in 12 years. Quentin Ship, 72, left two-year-old Whiskey lying in a field for three days before dragging the starving animal to shelter, South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court heard. Ship, of Yaxley, Suffolk, had previously been banned from keeping livestock for life due to a string of animal cruelty charges but had not been barred from keeping ponies. The emaciated piebald cob, which Ship had . propped up against a car tyre when moving it to the shelter, had to be . put down after the RSPCA were alerted to its suffering, the Ipswich . court heard. Cruel: Quentin Ship, 72, of Yaxley, Suffolk, was jailed for 23 weeks at South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to two-year-old piebald cob pony Whiskey, above . Ship had been due to stand trial yesterday for three animal cruelty offences but, when an abuse . of process argument failed to get the case dropped, he admitted them all. He was jailed for 23 weeks by Judge Celia Dawson after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to a pony by failing to provide necessary veterinary care and attention for a prolonged period between February 1 and February 8 last year. He also pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to ensure the welfare of an animal between January 18 and February 8 last year. The court heard Ship failed to protect Whiskey from suffering and disease after the starving pony lost weight and failed to provide adequate treatment for the pony's worm infection. An RSPCA vet and Ship's own vet said Whiskey was in such poor condition after he was found that he had to be put down. Judge Dawson said the case, along with his previous . history, meant he would be banned from owning any animal again for the rest of his life. She said: 'The animal had been unable to rise . for a week, was left lying in an open field in February, before being . dragged to a shelter where he was propped up by a car wheel. Tragic: Whiskey was left lying in a field starving for three days by Quentin Ship before being dragged to a shelter, above front, and propped against a car tyre. The emaciated pony had to be put down after the ordeal . 'Any caring owner could and should have sought proper veterinary advice and treatment.' The court heard Ship had been before a court four times in the last 12 years for similar offences and had been jailed before. 'He shows absolutely no remorse or willingness to accept responsibility for his actions now or in the past,' said Judge Dawson. Nicola Throne, spokesman for the RSPCA, said the prison sentence was 'wholly appropriate'. She said: 'The thing I found the most disturbing is that the pony collapsed . probably less than 100 yards from Mr Ship's kitchen window, so he could . see it every day. 'When he came out of the house the pony was collapsed in the field. After three days he dragged the pony into a shelter, but could still see him lying there. 'It was shocking really that somebody who has already got a . number of previous convictions for similar offences appears to have done . nothing and could still walk by that animal suffering every day. 'I feel the prison sentence is wholly appropriate in the circumstances. Mr Ship did not accept guilt or show any remorse for what had happened.'","Quentin Ship, 72, of Yaxley, Suffolk, was jailed for 23 weeks for causing unnecessary suffering to the animal .

A grinning serial female thief has been jailed for five years for repeatedly tricking her way into elderly people’s homes to steal their valuables. Geraldine Podmore, 31, asked her victims to call a taxi for her and then distracted them while she helped herself to cash, mobile phones and women’s handbags. A court heard drug addict Podmore targeted two residents at sheltered housing complex in Longton, Staffs., on November 22. Smirk: Conwoman Geraldine Podmore has been jailed after she tricked her way into elderly people's homes to steal their valuables . The first was an 83-year-old man who answered the door to the defendant at 7.20pm. At Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court prosecutor Heather Chamberlin said: 'She asked if he could call her a taxi to Hanley, and if she could step inside the flat to wait. 'She made small talk. The gentleman wasn’t comfortable with it and managed to usher her out, but then noticed his mobile phone, watch and wallet had gone from his bureau.' The serial offender, who has 24 convictions for 73 offences, then went to another flat - the home of a 78-year-old woman. Miss Chamberlin told the court: 'She said she was looking for her uncle who lived in another flat. They chatted for 10 minutes and the victim offered to help her find him. 'After going to another flat they returned and the defendant used the victim’s phone to call a taxi. They both went outside to wait for it. 'It was not until the next morning that the victim noticed her handbag had been stolen.' Thieving Podmore was arrested after a police officer recognised her on CCTV footage from the property. The court heard she also targeted the home of an 89-year-old woman in Bentilee, Staffs., on September 17, again asking the victim to call a taxi for her. Podmore, who has 24 convictions for 73 offences, pleaded guilty to two charges of burglary, three thefts and possessing a bladed article at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court . Podmore was invited in and asked for a glass of water and the victim then discovered her in a bedroom and asked her to leave. She also burgled the bungalow of a 67-year-old man with mobility problems in Longton, Staffs., after looking through his window and spotting him asleep in an arm chair. The victim woke at 4am to find his wallet and mobile phone had been stolen. The court heard she also stole a basket of shopping from Asda on August 29, and threatened to stab a staff member with a syringe when he challenged her. Podmore, of Normacot, Staffs., pleaded guilty to two charges of burglary, three thefts and possessing a bladed article - all of which were committed while she was on bail. The court heard she had a ‘considerable’ criminal record, with 24 convictions for 73 offences involving drugs, dishonesty and prostitution. Robert Smith, defending, said: 'She committed the offences to fund her alcohol and drug addiction.'She is utterly and thoroughly ashamed of herself.' Jailing her for five years, Judge Paul Glenn told her: 'This would have been a traumatic experience for all your victims. 'Elderly people are often left feeling unsafe in their own homes as a result of offences like these. 'It’s quite plain the only person you think about is yourself.'","Geraldine Podmore, 31, would ask her victims to call a taxi for her .

Feckless fathers should have their benefits slashed if they refuse to support their children, senior Tories said yesterday. Former minister Sir Gerald Howarth said action was needed to cut the £46billion of damage caused to society by the collapse of relationships. Citing statistics showing married parents are far more likely to stay together than those who are cohabiting, he said ministers should be ‘more judgmental’ about family breakdowns. Father of 22 Raymond Hull has not worked for 10 years but cost taxpayers £1.2million in unemployment handouts and housing benefits . And he suggested that fathers who refuse to support the upbringing of their children should have their benefits cut if they are on state handouts. Opening a Commons debate, Sir Gerald highlighted the case of father of 22 Raymond Hull, who was last week revealed to have cost the state £1.2million in benefits. He then listed a string of cases from his Hampshire constituency of mothers and children abandoned by their deadbeat partners. ‘We are not talking about a deprived inner city area – this is Aldershot,’ he said. ‘We cannot afford to continue subsidising people with dysfunctional lifestyles. 'Am I being judgmental when such an approach is deemed inappropriate? Of course I’m being judgmental – for the sake of our country we need to be more judgmental.’ Sir Gerald Howarth said ministers should be 'more judgmental' about family breakdowns . Sir Gerald cited Marriage Foundation figures showing that family breakdown now costs Britain an astonishing £46billion a year – up from £30billion in 2000. The figure comprises the impact of lower educational achievements, higher crime rates, pressure on housing stocks and healthcare and a higher benefits bill. Sir Gerald said figures from the Centre for Social Justice suggested that while fewer than one in ten  married couples separate before their child’s fifth birthday, one in three cohabiting couples will do so. He said successive governments had been too scared of popular opinion and failed to take heed of impartial evidence that marriage is in the interest of society. And he urged ministers to send a ‘clarion call’ that marriage provided the most stable bedrock for a family. Fellow grandee Sir Edward Leigh also urged ministers to speak out against the ‘modern plague’ of  relationship breakdown. ‘There is almost a conspiracy of silence about this issue,’ he said. ‘Over 50 years, in our permissive society, the view has grown up that people are happiest, they are completely liberated, and they do what they want to do – it’s about “me”. ‘And I believe that the churches, successive governments, schools, the BBC, national newspapers, ourselves as members of parliament, are all complicit in this permissive view of society which  has actually left a trail of despair in its wake.’","Former minister spoke of damaged caused by collapse of relationships .

The family of a missing autistic boy are pleading with the FBI to take on the case as the desperate search for the teenager continues. Avonte Oquendo disappeared from Riverview School in Long Island City, New York at lunchtime on October 4 after running out of a security door that had been left open. The 14-year-old is particularly vulnerable because his type of autism leaves him unable to speak and in need of 24-hour care. For months, the boy's family has organized search parties to scour the city for him, placed missing posters on the subway and in stores and raised a $95,000 reward. There have been a few sightings of teenage boys who closely resemble Avonte, raising the family's hopes - but he remains missing. Avonte Oquendo, 14, who is autistic and cannot speak, is still missing almost four months after he ran out of his school in Long Island City, New York . A new poster for the missing teenager was put out earlier this month as his family and friends keep up the pressure to find him . The Oquendo family are keeping up the pressure in the search. On January 5, the family posted a message on the Facebook page that they have set up to help find the boy pleading for FBI involvement. The message thanked volunteers for their continued help in looking for the missing teen over the winter holidays. The message continued: 'We would like to clarify that we have sought the help of the FBI and had petitioned them to take the lead in the investigation regarding Avonte. 'There are several legal reasons they gave us for not being legally permitted to take over the investigation. The most noted is that the NYPD has listed Avonte as a missing person, not a victim of kidnapping or other such federal offense(s) that would require the FBI's involvement. 'It is our deepest desire for the FBI to get involved but there is a system in place that requires protocol, we cannot force the FBI to get involved and we continually ask and pray they do.' The Oquendo family were devastated by remarks made by former NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly in October where he said it was unlikely that the teenager would be found alive.

Comedian Starr is one of several celebrities to be investigated by police in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. He was first arrested in November 2012 by detectives from Operation Yewtree, the national investigation launched to probe allegations of abuse by high-profile figures. The first claims were connected to late DJ Savile, who abused hundreds of children at including at hospitals and on BBC premises.

Beginning with a series from 1894, the pristine cards are among 300,000 donated to the Met by the late collector and cataloger Jefferson Burdick. Scroll Down for Video . Vintage: The exhibition includes a University of Southern California 1952 card of football star Frank Gifford, the New York Giants' No. 1 draft pick (left) and a vintage card of University of Washington star Hugh McElhenny . Trendsetting: This 1948 rare uncut set of Bowman football trading cards ushered in the modern era of football cards . The cards, which all predate the founding of a national football . league in 1920 and the first Super Bowl in 1967, were inserted into such products as candy, gum and tobacco. Many of the sets are beautiful color . lithographs that depict the players in action. A 1935 National Chicle .

Among . the greats, the collection features Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne, . whose career included six national college championships and entry into . the Hall of Fame in 1951, the first year of induction. The sport began as an intercollegiate game that fused soccer and rugby. Athletic clubs eventually formed football leagues. The most powerful, the Ohio League, became the American Professional Football Conference in 1920 before changing its name to the National Football League two years later. The first Super Bowl came about only after the formation of the American Football League in 1960. Rare: This 1894 football card of Harvard's John Dunlop is the rarest in the collection. Collectors regard it as the Honus Wagner of football cards because Dunlop is the only player in the series whose name and school affiliation is missing, and he was only identified a decade ago .

'Commercially . printed lithographs are part of our printed visual culture,' she added. 'It's viewed within the spectrum of what art is.' Incredible history: UCLA tailback and Los Angeles Rams running back Kenny Washington is shown in this 1948 Leaf Gum Company football trading card. Washington played alongside Jackie Robinson at UCLA and in 1946 became one of the first black players in the NFL after a 12-year ban . This card of Tom Hupke is among a set of 1935 National Chicle Gum Company vintage football trading cards . Burdick, an electrician from Syracuse, New York, began donating his 300,000-card collection to the Met in 1947. In organizing the material at the Met over a 15-year period, Burdick devised a classification system that has become the standard for cataloging trading cards. He died in 1963. Burdick's collection has offered the museum ample material for special exhibitions over the years. He amassed 30,000 baseball cards. The Met is presenting the pop-up exhibition celebrating . football's history through the ages with vintage trading cards from January 24 to February 10.

A rogue detective has been jailed after he illegally searched his own force's database and tipped off a convicted drug dealer about raids and arrests. Daniel Watts, 31, passed crucial intelligence to 33-year-old Stephen Hunt from West Midlands Police computers for more than seven years. Police today declared that 'no police officer is above the law' after Watts was jailed for 28 months. Bent cop: Former detective Daniel Watts (left) has been jailed after he leaked vital information about raids and arrests by West Midlands police to Stephen Hunt (right), a convicted drug dealer . Stafford Crown Court heard the detective, from Erdington, West Midlands, joined the force more than 10 years ago and first leaked data to Hunt in April 2005 while he was on trial for supplying drugs. He was repeatedly 'tasked' by Hunt to make the illegal searches and pass information on the drug dealer and his criminal associates. The illegal checks continued up until Watts was discovered in March last year when police raided . the home of a crime suspect. There they seized a mobile phone containing a text message which, via another phone, was traced to a . mobile used by Watts. The text message was about police raids and was so accurate, it could only have been provided from . confidential police systems. Searches: Watts used the IT systems of West Midlands Police, pictured, and was discovered through a text messages on a criminal's phone (file photo: none of those pictured were accused of wrongdoing) Anti-corruption . officers were able to prove the message originated from a phone . attributable to Watts and was sent when he was on duty and using a . police computer work station. At first the former detective admitted his checks were not for legitimate police business - but claimed they were 'out of curiosity', or to check whether what Hunt was telling him was accurate. At the start of . their friendship Watts said the checks were conducted to ensure he was . not associating with a criminal and he claimed not to have sent any . confidential or sensitive information, or anything Hunt would not . already have known. Watts was investigated by his own force West Midlands Police, whose Birmingham headquarters are pictured . But Watts later admitted conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office in court. He was sacked by West Midlands Police for gross misconduct on August 29 last year and was jailed in October. His case could not be reported until now because Hunt was facing a drugs trial. Hunt, from West Heath, Birmingham, denied conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office but was found guilty and jailed for 28 months. For the drug dealing offences, he was handed an extra 10 years' jail. Superintendent Tim Godwin from West . Midlands Police’s Professional Standards Department said: 'Police . officers take a vow to serve the public and uphold the law with . fairness, integrity and impartiality. Any that fall short of those . standards, or who abuse their position, will face disciplinary action, . the prospect of criminal prosecution and potential dismissal. 'No . police officer is above the law.

Prosecutors will seek an indictment against a North Carolina police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed man 10 times after he survived a car accident and banged on the door of a nearby house in the middle of the night looking for help. The officer, Randall Kerrick, 27, is charged with voluntary manslaughter in the September shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, a 24-year-old former Florida A&M University football player. Jonathan’s family claim that Ferrell was in a submissive position – either on his knees or lying on the ground – when he was shot, according to NBC News. The autopsy report revealed that the bullets were on a downward trajectory when they struck. Willie Ferrell, left, joins attorney Christopher Chestnut, center, his mother, Georgia Ferrell, right, and other family members at a media conference to talk about the killing of his brother, Jonathan Ferrell in Charlotte . The lawsuit also alleges that despite Ferrell . lying mortally wounded on the ground officers still deemed it necessary . to handcuff him, according to NBC News. As well as compensation, the family is hoping the suit forces the police to make Officer Kerrick’s dash-cam video public for the first time. The deadly encounter unfolded in Charlotte at about 2.30 a.m. on Saturday September 14 after Mr Ferrell had apparently been in an automobile wreck. A crash so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape. Law suit: The family of Jonathan Ferrell (left) claim that he was wrongfully killed by Officer Randall Kerrick (right) in September 2013 . Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house at the upscale Bradfield Farm community and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention. Thinking it was her husband coming home late from work, the woman who lived there opened the door. When she saw Ferrell, she shut it and called police. The authorities subsequently released a tape of her 911 call. A sobbing woman can be heard pleading for police to ‘please hurry’ after telling a dispatcher that a man was breaking into her front door. ‘He’s still there yelling,’ the woman said as the 911 dispatcher told her officers were on their way. ‘He’s yelling. He’s yelling.’ The unidentified woman keeps repeating ‘Oh, my god! Oh, my god!’ throughout the call. She also told the 911 operator that she had a baby in a crib and didn't know what to do. ‘He’s in his bed. I don’t know what to do. I can’t believe I opened the door,’ she said. Jonathan Ferrell ran up to this house in the upscale Bradfield Farm community and started 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention . Later, she said the man was knocking on her door and ‘he's in my front yard yelling.’ When three officers arrived they claim that Ferrell ran towards them. One officer attempted to Taser Ferrell but that didn't work and investigators said Ferrell continued to run towards Officer Randall Kerrick who had his service weapon drawn. Officer Kerrick fired 12 shots at Ferrell, striking Ferrell ten times. CMPD said officers on the scene thought Ferrell was a threat, but Kerrick was the only one who drew his gun and fired. Kerrick appeared in court in September after being charged with voluntary manslaughter. He is the first officer charged in a fatal shooting in more than 30 years. ‘We’re confident at the resolution of this case it will be found that Officer Kerrick’s actions were justified on the night in question,’ his attorney Michael Greene said in a brief statement outside the courtroom, reports The Charlotte Observer. Heartbroken: Ferrell's mother, pictured right, said Kerrick had no business being a police officer if he couldn't react properly to a man who needed help . Ferrell's family said the former Florida A&M University football player moved to Charlotte about a year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs. He wanted to go back to school and eventually become an automotive engineer. Ferrell's mother said Kerrick had no business being a police officer if he couldn't react properly to a man who needed help. 'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said. His family painted a picture of a bright man with an 'infectious smile' who was always there for his brothers and sisters. 'He was a role model,' said his brother, Frank. 'He had so much love in his heart. And he was always concerned about his family.' 'He had dreams of being an automotive engineer. He wanted to design a car from the very last bolt to the interior,' his brother said. He said he didn't know where his brother was going that night, or why he got into the accident. But he said his brother had never been in trouble before. Kerrick is on paid leave while the Charlotte police department conducts an investigation. He will appear before a grand jury on January 21.","Randall Kerrick, 27, is accused of unlawfully shooting Jonathan Ferrell, 24 .

Mrs Papworth, 77, who was married to retired agricultural worker Gordon for 60 years, said: 'I was so angry. I was complaining every day in the end. 'All his pension money went into the care home; it just didn’t seem fair. The stench of the place took your breath away and there was urine on the floor.

Hailey Hanestad thinks nothing about nuzzling up to the animal, called Wiley, and even dozes off with him on her bed. She's even taken to howling with him during the evenings. Wiley has been a treasured member of the family since being rescued by Hailey's dad, Rick, three years ago. Coyote Wiley enjoys sprawling up with Hailey, 8, on the grade schooler's bed while she does her homework in Eau Claire, Wisconsin . Bed alert: Wiley snoozes peacefully while Hailey reads . Friends: Coyote Wiley sniffs Hailey at their home . Wiley the Coyote seen with another dog in Eau Claire . Today he's thought to be just one of two coyotes in the US that have become domesticated after being born in the wild. And at the Hanestad farm, near Eau Claire, Wisconsin, he's treated just like a dog - sitting by the fire in the winter, going for walks on a lead and even playing fetch with a tennis ball. He's got his own comfy chair and enjoys a diet of venison and fried eggs. He even has to have his meat cooked - because he won't eat it raw. It's a picture of domestic bliss. Let's just hope he doesn't spot a roadrunner... Coyotes are a wild species of canine found throughout North and Central America. Coyote is a Mexican Spanish word with origins in the Aztec work 'coyotl' which means trickster. They live as far south as Panama and in such cold climates as Alaska. Wiley is an exceptional coyote since his species is incredibly hard to domesticate unless raised from an early age. Even then, the coyote's wild nature usually comes out around puberty. While many species have become threatened with human encroachment, coyotes have actually prospered and become more populous. They are often seen living near humans and feeding off of garbage. Coyotes subsist off a variety of foods from deer to insects and other invertebrates. Like other canines, coyotes live in packs but actually hunt in pairs. For the most part, they aren't a threat to humans, but attacks have been on the rise in California.
