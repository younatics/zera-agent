"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A sailor has been shot dead on a guided-missile destroyer while docked at a Virginia naval base and security forces killed the suspect in the aftermath. The names of the sailor and the suspect have not been released while the Navy contacts their families. The suspect was a civilian who had access to be at Naval Station Norfolk, spokeswoman Terri Davis said early Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Security threat on board: A male sailor was shot by another man, a civilian, who was able to gain access to the USS Mahan on Monday night and the suspect was shot dead by security forces later (pictured in 2004) Base: A number of destroyers are regularly docked at the Norfolk Navy Base, including air craft carriers like the USS Eisenhower, USS George H.W. Bush, USS Truman and USS Lincoln, all pictured there in 2012 . She said she couldn't say whether he had permission to be on the USS Mahan, where the male sailor was shot about 11.20pm Monday. No other injuries were reported, and the base was briefly on lockdown, according to the Navy. Davis would not describe any other circumstances of the shooting but said the scene was secure. Operations have returned to normal at the base, with counselors available, the Navy said in a news release. Regardless . of the shooting, most enlisted sailors on the Mahan — docked at the . first of 13 main piers — were not to report to duty Tuesday. Base . traffic was typical Tuesday morning. The . shooting on the Mahan comes about a month after the Navy held . anti-terrorism and force protection exercises on bases around the U.S., . including an active-shooter drill at the Norfolk station. Drill: Just last month, the Norfolk Naval Base held anti-terror drills (pictured) as did Navy bases across the country . To . get on the base, civilians must be escorted or have a pass. Each base . entrance is guarded, and all 13 piers have additional security forces. As part of ongoing security efforts, handheld ID scanners were . implemented this year at Navy bases in the region, including the Norfolk . station. The shooting comes . six months after a September incident at the Washington Navy Yard, in . which a gunman — identified as a contractor and former Navy reservist — . killed 12 civilian workers before being shot to death. The . Norfolk base covers more than 6,000 acres and is the home port for 64 . ships, according to information the Navy provided in February. About . 46,000 military members and 21,000 civilian government employees and . contractors are assigned to the base and its ships, according to the . Navy figures. Earlier drills: The Norfolk Naval Base just ran anti-terrorism drills last month that included an active-shooter drill (guards pictured at the base entrance in 2004) The base also is the home port for a Navy hospital ship, docked at Pier 1 with the Mahan. In . February, the Norfolk base got a new commanding officer, Capt. Robert . E. Clark Jr. He took over for Capt. David A. Culler Jr., who was set to . retire in May. Clark had served as the installation's executive officer . since 2012. The Mahan, . commissioned in 1998, has a crew of nearly 300.

"By . Adam Crafton . What a difference a year makes. At the beginning of April last year, Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United headed into the derby at Old Trafford 15 points clear of Manchester City. On Tuesday evening, it is Manuel Pellegrini’s City who will stroll into their neighbours’ backyard with a strut of arrogance, knowing United’s status has been diminished to that of inferiors. This time it is they who sit in the ascendency, 12 points ahead of David Moyes’ ailing side. A win would convert 12 into 15. Damning: Our graphic shows years of United dominance, with the difference in points between the two sides going into Old Trafford derbies heavily in their favour, but the pendulum appears to have swung . Bubble's burst: David Moyes will be desperate to beat Manchester City at Old Trafford on Tuesday night . Saviour? Wayne Rooney scores his wonder goal against West Ham last weekend . Focus: Manchester City's players look fired up in their training session ahead of the derby at Old Trafford . Two more victories in City’s games in hand on United and the gap would become 21. It is a prospect barely worth thinking about for those at Old Trafford, offering a frightening snapshot of just how far United have plummeted in the post-Ferguson era. Yet there would also be little surprise if United were to surrender once more. After all, they have won just one match in 12 against the top nine in the Barclays Premier League this season, losing seven of those. It is not difficult to see, therefore, why City are the bookmakers’ favourites to win a match at Old Trafford for the first time since the inception of the Premier League. City have inflicted the odd flesh wound in the past, of course. Kevin Keegan’s side, with Jon Macken up front rather than Sergio Aguero, as the main man beat United 4-1 at the City of Manchester Stadium in 2004. More cuttingly, there was that 6-1 . two years ago at Old Trafford, leaving Ferguson ‘shattered’ after the . ‘worst result in my history, ever’. And then there was the last-gasp . Aguero goal to snatch the title from United in the most dramatic manner . possible. These were . body-blows to the United system but they were swiftly corrected, first . through the signing of Robin van Persie, ahead of City, and . then by reclaiming the title in Ferguson’s final season. Blip? Shaun Goater scores for Manchester City in the 3-1 win at Maine Road in 2002 . Unprecedented: Trevor Sinclair celebrates back in 2004 during the 4-1 rout of their rivals . Old rivalry: City fans goad then opposition manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the 2004 victory . It's been 44 years since Manchester City beat United in three consecutive league matches. City could break this run if they win at Old Trafford on Wednesday. The Blues won 2-1 at Old Trafford last April before battering David Moyes' side 4-1 in his first derby at the Etihad in September. So, can they make it three on the bounce once again? It is a very long time indeed since United were last unequivocally considered the weaker force in Manchester and that should be a serious concern within the walls of Old Trafford. Certainly, it has never been the case in the Premier League era. Indeed, only twice before have United entered a Manchester derby at home in the Premier League trailing City on points. Before the 6-1 in 2012, City were two points ahead of Ferguson’s side but that was after just eight games. The only other occasion was an anomaly, in September 2005, when United were one point behind Stuart Pearce’s City. City had played four games to United three, meaning that particular statistic was rather skewed. Another rout: City hammered United at the Etihad earlier this season with Sergio Aguero scoring . Not you again: Aguero struck the winner at Old Trafford last season with a powerful effort after a nice run . Relief for United: Aguero has been ruled out of Tuesday's derby with a hamstring injury . The turnaround can perhaps be more readily attributed to United’s decline than City’s development in this past year. Intriguingly, for all the calmness instilled by their phlegmatic manager, City are only four points better off than they were after 28 games last season. United, by contrast, are 26 points worse off than they were at the same stage last season. All things considered, it does not require much this season to be more formidable than Moyes’ side. Big-game player: Yaya Toure has been in exceptional form of late for City . Unstoppable: Rooney scores a tremendous overhead kick against City in 2011 . Tormentor: Rooney has a penchant for scoring against City in Manchester derbies . But we should not forget that is new territory for City supporters, for the first time indisputably the dominant outfit. Previously, this would be the stuff of printed T-shirts. Now, it is par for the course. This can be rammed home if Pellegrini’s side secure a third consecutive league victory at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. That has not happened for more than 40 years, when City won five games in a row at the home of United between 1967 and 1972. Another enemy: Steven Gerrard celebrates after scoring against Manchester United . Sore sight: Luis Suarez netted Liverpool's third at Old Trafford on a dismal day for United fans . It would be the latest of a succession of records to topple under Moyes and fresh on the back of a 3-0 humiliation by Liverpool, defeat against City would provide compelling evidence that the tide has turned irretrievably in Manchester. Dropping below City or Liverpool is one thing, to fall below the two is another thing entirely. But that is the unacceptable reality that the rank-and-file at Old Trafford may be just obliged to accept come Tuesday evening at The Theatre of Dreams.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Martin Demichelis and Manchester City didn't appear to be feeling the weight of expectation as the Argentine and his team-mates prepared for their crucial derby clash. And City manager Manuel Pellegrini underlined the confidence coursing City by claiming that his team ‘expect’ to win the Old Trafford derby on Tuesday night.

Pellegrini played down City’s tag as favourites and insisted that . maintaining his club’s title challenge is more important than securing . bragging rights over their neighbours. He . added: ‘We know it’s a derby, of course, but for our target we must add . three points. We don’t just need to win tomorrow and lose the next . game.

It has been a very . close Premier League from the beginning of the season and until the . last match it will be the same way. ‘One . of the positive things of being eliminated from other competitions is . that we are just focusing on the Premier League.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Millions of viewers watched David Beckham sign a football for a young fan during Sport Relief's Only Fools And Horses sketch on Friday evening. But while they will have undoubtedly recognised the superstar, most will have been unaware that the six-year-old boy was actually the grandson of the show's creator, John Sullivan. Joe Sullivan was filmed asking Beckham for an autograph in a market in the sketch - before holding up a football for him to sign. Star: Joe Sullivan, who appeared in the Only Fools And Horses sketch, is the grandson of the show's creator . Touching moment: David Beckham sign a football for six-year-old Joe during the special Sport Relief sketch . Talented: Joe's grandfather, John Sullivan, created the famous British sitcom, but passed away three years ago . The schoolboy's grandfather, who created and wrote the famous British sitcom, passed away in 2011. Today, his family said they thought it would be a fitting tribute to feature Joe in the sketch, which helped Sport Relief raise a record £51million for charity. Dan Sullivan, Joe’s father, told the Sunday Express: 'My brother Jim and I put the sketch together and Jim thought it would be nice to include Joe in it. 'We agreed that if dad had been here to write it he would probably have tried to include one of his grandchildren in it.' Appearance: Beckham delighted fans after recreating Del Boy's famous bar fall in the special Sport Relief show . Falling: The superstar topples over while speaking to Joe, who appeared in a tribute to his late grandfather . Smooth: In the original skit (pictured) Del Boy is heard telling pal Trigger: 'Play it nice and cool son, nice and cool. You know what I mean', before falling through a bar . Mr Sullivan said his son had been 'very nervous' before filming - adding that he had relaxed after meeting 38-year-old Beckham, who wore a cap and thick-rimmed glasses in the episode. 'David really put him at ease,' he said. 'David’s got children of his own and he’s got a really nice manner and is very natural and down to earth. 'Joe did really well. We are very proud of him and I am sure my dad would have been too.' Not them this time! Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst, who plays Rodney, are seen looking on from their market stall as Beckham lands on the ground . Golden Balls: Earlier in the scene Del Boy and Rodney are seen attempting to sell the star's signed 'boxer briefs' on their market stall, with the latter failing miserably at modelling the white undergarments .

The superstar is later seen sitting with them at their local . cafe after dismal sales, before offering Rodney, played by Nicholas . Lyndhurst, some modelling advice. David is heard telling him: 'Most people think modelling is about . standing there looking great, but there's more to it than that. Just . remember a good model doesn't just walk, he glides. They don't just . turn, they oscillate.' Peckham pals: The 38-year-old superstar is then seen sitting with them at their local cafe after dismal sales, before he offers Rodney some modelling advice . Great reception: Viewers took to Twitter to share their delight during the BBC1 show, with one writing: 'David Beckham's fall on Only Fools and Horses was almost as funny as the original. Totally didn't expect it either' As Rodney gives it . another go, Beckham is seen watching from afar, and, after signing the football for Joe, he goes to lean on a nearby crate before falling to . the floor in the exactly the same way as David Jason did in the series.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Theresa May is concerned Yahoo's planned relocation could prevent British counter-terrorism experts gaining access to users' information . Theresa May is concerned that Yahoo’s planned move to Dublin could prevent British counter-terrorism experts gaining access to users’ information. The home secretary has reportedly called for an urgent meeting with executives from the internet giant - whose European base is currently in London - to talk about security. If the relocation of the firm’s headquarters goes ahead, Yahoo would not have to comply with British surveillance laws, such as handing over information demanded by intelligence agencies and Scotland Yard, The Guardian reported. This information can currently be obtained using Britain’s anti-terror law, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) and this has caused Yahoo to be concerned about keeping its millions of users’ information private. Among the disclosures in documents leaked by former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden, were reports that GCHQ intercepted and stored the images of millions of people using Yahoo webcams. Yahoo said that that the British intelligence agency's actions were ‘a whole new level of violation of our user’s privacy’. It was also claimed that the NSA had secretly tapped into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and Google data centres around the world and Yahoo has promised to add enhanced encryption technology to its email service. Experts said that the UK’s anti-terror law gives police and spooks too much access to people’s personal online material. Now Chares Farr, the head of the office . for security and counter-terrorism (OSCT) has reportedly put pressure on . Theresa May to talk to Yahoo about the effect of its move to Dublin. Exposed: Among the most disclosures in documents leaked by former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden, were reports that GCHQ intercepted and stored the images of millions of people using Yahoo webcams. Yahoo (logo pictured) said that that the move was 'a whole new level of violation of our user's privacy' A Whitehall source told The Guardian: ‘There are concerns in the Home Office about how Ripa will apply to Yahoo once it has moved its headquarters to Dublin.’ ‘The home secretary asked to see officials from Yahoo because in Dublin they don't have equivalent laws to Ripa. This could particularly affect investigations led by Scotland Yard and the national crime agency. They regard this as a very serious issue.’ The Dublin move was announced by the company last month and Yahoo said that the decision was driven by ‘business needs’. A Yahoo spokesman told MailOnline: 'In line with the expansion of our Irish operations announced last year, we have made the decision to streamline our operations further and therefore, as of March 21, the services for all our European users will be provided by Yahoo EMEA in Ireland. 'Yahoo is committed to expanding its operations internationally. To that end, Yahoo strives to make its business operations efficient and flexible. The recent notification of change to the provision of products is part of that drive. 'We can confirm that we have no plans to close any of our European operations and are committed to driving growth for Yahoo in EMEA.' Following the claims that GCHQ collected images of millions of people using Yahoo webcams, Yahoo said it is ‘committed to preserving our users trust and security and continue our efforts to expand encryption across all of our services.’ It dubbed the intelligence agency’s actions: ‘completely unacceptable’ and called for reform of anti-terror laws. Edward Snowden claimed that the NSA secretly tapped into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and Google data centres around the world. Both Google and Yahoo said they would boost encryption technology for their email services to make it harder for surveillance agencies to intercept messages. Google and Yahoo have spoken out against the U.S. government's spy programmes. They are worried more people will reduce their online activities if they believe almost everything they do is being monitored by the government. A decline in Internet use could hurt the companies financially by giving them fewer opportunities to show online ads and sell other services. The NSA has said it only focuses on targets with foreign intelligence value.","The home secretary has reportedly called for an urgent meeting with executives from the internet giant to talk about security .

"By . Scarlett Russell . As any pet owner knows, the bond between animals and their owner is a sacred one. But even the most ardent animal-lover will be amazed by the story of Hercules, the grizzly bear cub taken in by a Scottish couple in 1976. From that day, and for every day over the next 25 years, Hercules lived in peace with Andy and Maggie Robin, becoming the most famous bear in the world and appearing in adverts and even in the James Bond film, Octopussy, in which he briefly shared the screen with Roger Moore.

A documentary on Ch5, Hercules The Human Bear, charts the bear's incredible life, showing unbelievable footage of the bear opening doors to have breakfast with his 'family,' Andy and Maggie Robin . Hercules The Human Bear charts the life of the grizzly who was taken in and looked after by Scottish couple Andy and Maggie Robin in 1976, and lived with them for 25 years. Andy Robin trained Hercules to become a professional sparring partner, and the bear found worldwide fame throughout his 25-year life . Maggie Robin, pictured here with Hercules, explains in the documentary, Hercules the Human Bear, how he became such a significant part of her life that she and husband Andy even sacrificed having children so they could devote attention to their furry 'baby' A documentary on Channel 5, Hercules The Human Bear, charts his incredible life and has extensive interviews with Andy and Maggie, showing unbelievable footage of the bear opening doors to have breakfast with the couple, sparring with Andy and tenderly cuddling up to the pair. Andy and Maggie bought Hercules from a wildlife park in Kincraig on 20 September 1976, for just £50, after Andy decided he wanted a grizzly bear to train and enter wrestling competitions with. ‘I’ll never forget the day Andy came home and said, ""What would you think if I said I was going to get a bear?""' laughs Maggie in the programme, airing on April 3. Andy devised a hardcore regime with Hercules, including sparring sessions and cross-country runs, and they trained every day. During one training session Hercules deliberately tripped Andy and pinned him to the ground, . ‘He stood back and looked at me as if to say, “I’m your friend, I’m not going to bite you,”’ says Andy. ‘It was then I knew we had star in the making.’ Little did they know what a phenomenon Hercules would become. Clip courtesy of Middle Child Productions . Pucker up! Andy and Maggie Robin were incredibly close to their grizzly bear Hercules. Andy personally trained him and the three lived as a family for 25 years . People could hardly believe the close bond that Scottish Andy Robin shared with Hercules. Grizzly bears are regarded as one of the world's most dangerous mammal . Hercules, pictured here with Andy Robin, was bought for £50 by Andy from a wildlife park in Kincraig, Scotland on 20 September 1976 . Andy Robin, pictured here with Hercules as a bear cub, trained the bear every day and his Scottish home and the two became inseparable until Hercules died of natural causes in 2000 . Their wrestling performances in the late 1970s and early 1980s were watched by millions and the unique relationship captured the hearts of a nation. Andy and Maggie explain just how on earth they managed to live under the same roof as a grizzly bear, regarded as the world’s most dangerous land mammal. The couple had no formal animal training, yet allowed 9ft, 70st Hercules to share every part of their lives. It shows Hercules being called for dinner, opening the door by himself and sitting down to eat. ‘He didn’t eat wild food, he had refined taste buds,’ says Maggie. In the morning he’d have coffee with evaporated milk and sugar with bread, eggs and beans. At night he’d have meat and potatoes soup carrots – and even sometimes a cheeky slug of beer. ‘He was happy drunk,’ laughs Maggie. Andy and Maggie Robin were Hercules' biggest fans and even scarified having children as they were so devotes to the bear. He lived with them his entire life and was personally trained by Andy . Andy Robin says Hercules, pictured here as a young cub, was 'a real character,' and 'part of the family' ‘It didn’t happen often but it was very funny when he did. He’d hiccup. ‘He was a real character.’ Hercules’ fame rose and he became the star of adverts for Kleenex and Hofmeister Beer. He was on the front cover of Time magazine, met Margaret Thatcher and caddied for Bob Hope at a golf tournament. Hercules’ stardom took the family to California for two years, before coming home to Scotland in 1989, where Andy and Maggie build him the Big Bear Ranch in 1989. The 30-acre site included a swimming pool. At 20, Hercules was at the height of his career and was booked to star in a natural history film about bears for the BBC. After filming his final scenes, he collapsed in agony. 'We knew something was seriously wrong with him,' says Maggie quietly, as the documentary explores the subsequent events in Hercules' life. In 1998, the bear went into hibernation and when he awoke he couldn’t walk. A year later, aged 24, he went into hospital for an operation on his spine. His treatment was covered by news crews and fans very step of the way. He died on 4 February 2000, at 25 years old, of natural causes. ‘That teddy bear we all had as a child became my everyday reality,’ Maggie says. ‘Hercules never let me down once. ‘We shared a charmed life full of adventure, love and laughter that still, to this day, makes me smile.’ The programme concludes with a trip to the Outer Hebrides where a life-sized statue of Hercules is unveiled at Langass Woodland.

Andy Murray is set to miss the opening of his own hotel in Scotland – but will be sending mum Judy along instead. The 26-year-old bought the Cromlix House Hotel in Perthshire for £1.9million and it is due to open to the public on April 4. But the tennis star will be busy in Italy, preparing for the Davis Cup quarter final and won’t be able to attend the grand unveiling. Defending champion: Andy Murray is currently playing in the Miami Open and will go straight on to the Davis Cup quarter final in Italy . Instead, his mum Judy will be the guest of honour – which is probably fitting considering she has masterminded much of the hotel’s refit. There has been a lot of attention on the 15-bed hotel, which will have its own Chez Roux restaurant, overseen by Albert Roux, who owns La Gavroche in London – the first British restaurant to win three Michelin stars. Set in 34 acres of secluded woodland, just five miles from Dunblane, rooms at the grand hotel will cost up to £585 per night in peak season. It had been reported that Murray would be attending the opening of the hotel, but the tennis star is currently in Miami, where he is the defending champion of the Miami Open. Grand design: The Cromlix House Hotel is set to open on April 4 and will boast a chapel, reception hall, two drawing rooms, conservatory, dining room and library . Having made it through to the third round, after defeating Australian Matthew Ebden, it is hoped he will be in the competition until it ends on March 30, before travelling to Naples for the quarter finals of the Davis Cup. A spokesperson for the hotel confirmed to the Scottish Daily Record that the sportsman would not be in attendance, stating: ‘Judy will be there but Andy’s not going to be around at the time of the opening.’ The hotel is opening just ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup, which is being staged in Gleneagles. Which is just a short drive away. In the family: The estate is where Murray's brother Jamie got married in 2010 . Due to the sports competition and interest in the hotel’s owner, the Cromlix has reported strong bookings figures ahead of its opening. The hotel will be managed on behalf of Murray by Inverlochy Castle Management International, which already runs a series of independent properties in Scotland. Norbert Lieder, ICMI’s managing director, said: ‘I am confident that, with Andy, we can create a very special hotel in his home community.  While we aim to create a destination that attracts visitors from around the world we are also determined to ensure it remains a venue of choice for local people.’ The hotel was previously in the hands of the Eden family for 30 years and was a popular wedding venue. Murray’s brother Jamie married his Colombian wife Alejandra Gutierrez there in 2010.","The tennis star will be preparing for the Davis Cup quarter final in Italy .

Following the submission of the plans, neighbours in Belsize Park, north London, have complained to Camden Council . On screen: The 54-year-old actor is known for his roles in Game of Thrones (left) and Sharpe (right) His original application was rejected because the terrace overlooked neighbours and his modified bid with the screens has now been turned down too. One local said: ‘This is now the second or third time our neighbour “Mr Bean” asked to have his terrace on the second floor altered. ‘We rejected it twice. We felt it impaired our privacy, took light away etc. But anyway, he put an array of boxes with evergreen plants on that roof terrace. ‘We gave in to that but a glass wall, as low as it might be, gives us the feeling of being blocked. Why doesn’t he just erect his desired safe railings and leave the plants there and that is it?’ Ideas: Plans show a second-floor flat roof which Mr Bean wants to turn into a terrace and then screen with a mixture of olive, bay and laurel trees and a glass wall, with double doors leading into a bedroom .

They were rejected by council planners in late January, who wrote: ‘The proposed privacy screen would, by virtue of its location, scale and design, detract from the appearance of the host building and fail to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area.’ Mr Bean, who bought his four-bedroom home in 1998, launched an appeal against the latest refusal on March 13.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Beyonce has contributed an essay to Maria Shriver's annual report on the status of women in America. The singer joined top womenâ€™s rights activists like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Facebook COO and Lean In author Sheryl Sandberg, and designer Tory Burch who all wrote essays touting the importance of gender equality. 'We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isnâ€™t a reality yet,' Beyonce wrote in The Shriver Report. Powerful women: Beyonce has written an essay for a female empowerment project spearheaded by Maria Shriver (seen here together in 2010 at Coachella when Shriver was the First Lady of California) The Grammy-award winner signed the essay using her hyphenated married name, Beyonce Knowles-Carter. 'Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal?' she wrote. 'We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities.' Beyonce was not the only celebrity to contribute an essay to the free packet, as Eva Longoria wrote about the need to empower Latinas and basketball superstar LeBron James who wrote a letter in appreciation of his single mother. Who run the world? Both Beyonce and Shriver have been outspoken advocates for gender equality . 'You think LeBron James is a champion? Gloria James is a champion too. She's my champion,' he wrote. Beyonce has been a vocal proponent of female empowerment through her music for years- with Independent Woman and Who Run The World (Girls) among her biggest hits. She has also been more vocal about the concept of feminism in press statements over the past year, including an April 2013 interview with British Vogue where she said that she is a modern-day feminist. 'I do believe in equality and that we have a way to go and it's something that's pushed aside and something that we have been conditioned to accept,' she explained after being criticized for calling her latest tour The Mrs Carter Show World Tour. Political action: Beyonce, and husband Jay Z (seen together at the President's second inauguration), have been big supporters of the Obamas and Democratic causes . 'But I'm happily married. I love my husband.' This may be the first time that Beyonce worked partnered up with Ms Shriver- a member of the Democratic Kennedy clan- for an outreach project but certainly not the first time that she has become involved in political issues. Beyonce is a strong supporter of President Obama and has regularly performed at events for him and spoken out on behalf of causes that First Lady Michelle headlines.","Maria Shriver has produced a report on gender equality in America .

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Ryan Kisiel . When multi-millionaire Giles Mackay planned his family’s dream home, every detail had to be perfect. The property tycoon set out meticulous plans for the £100million house, even telling workers he wanted his new library’s leather shelves to be hand-stitched to look like the upholstery in an Aston Martin. But when the vast project was hit by delays, his relationship with his design team appears to have soured dramatically. Abuse: Property developer Giles Mackay branded an architect a 'f****** little t***' and boasted about his superior wealth in a string of abusive emails . Mr Mackay, 50, said he woke up in the . morning wanting to kill his architect, and described the wife of another . business partner as ‘avaricious and jealous’ and ‘needing a ******* . good slapping’. He sent around 3,700 emails to firms . involved in the project. In one, to a director of his building . contractors, he fumed: ‘My middle name is “Relentless”. I have the money . and anger at this point to push on and make sure that you have to . deliver or get punished for not delivering.’ He went on: ‘Guess what, when I have . forgotten about you in a year’s time, enjoying my £100million home or . sailing on one of my 40-metre yachts, you’ll still be trying to wind up . some other poor unsuspecting customer with your brand of mediocrity – a . sad loser – gaining your kicks and being irritating. ‘Suggest a new career as a traffic . warden might be ideal at least it wouldn’t involve lying.’ Mr Mackay, . who is worth around £134million, threatened to sue the contractor, . Walter Lilly & Company, over the delays and alleged defects in their . work at his house, on one of Britain’s most expensive streets. But a High Court judge said he had . ‘lost nearly all sense of objectivity’ over the house in Kensington, . West London, and branded the project ‘a disaster waiting to happen’. Mr Justice Akenhead said Mr Mackay’s . behaviour to his architect and the contractors was ‘not simply coarse’ but ‘combative, bullying and aggressive’. Mr Mackay, a trained barrister who . founded the property data company Hometrack and affordable homes . specialist Assettrust, bought the five-storey townhouse in 2004. He . wanted it to be a dream home for him, his wife and their two children, . complete with a swimming pool, basement cinema, wine cellar, gymnasium, . staff quarters, a guest suite and a state-of-the-art ‘light wall’. His wife Caroline, a solicitor, spent . hours planning it and told the High Court she wanted it to be ‘modern, . stylish, with great attention to detail, luxurious with the highest . quality of finish with smart, shiny dark glossy floors, luxurious . bathrooms, beautiful lighting and elegant perfect finishes’. It appeared cost was no object, as . estimates warned that the stitching on the library’s leather shelves . alone was likely to top £41,000. But as work began, Mr and Mrs Mackay . noticed a growing number of faults. The agreed ‘American Black Walnut’ for . the floors was too orange, there were no ballet bars in the gym and Mrs . Mackay described the finish in her children’s bathrooms as ‘a . disgrace’. Mr Mackay said ‘every room in the . house contained defective plastering’ and told his architects, Barrett . Lloyd Davis Associates, they were ‘a disgrace to [their] profession’. The case ended up in court earlier . this year after Walter Lilly & Company claimed money had been taken . off its payment for alleged defects and delays. Mr Mackay’s firm, DMW Developments, . counter-sued, asking for damages for alleged defects in the work, and . saying it had overpaid for the work. But Mr Justice Akenhead ruled in favour of Walter Lilly and said it was owed more than £2.3million. Mr Mackay, who spent more than £6million on legal work for the case, said he plans to appeal against the judgment.","Arrogant Giles Mackay boasted of his superior wealth in a string of abusive emails .

"By . Rob Preece . Tiger, Ferret and Awesome are among the quirky names which have been given to babies born in Britain in the last year. At least three families have given the name Miracle to newborn boys, and at least three girls have been called Tequila by their parents. A football-mad family even decided to name their child Rooney-Scholes in tribute to two Manchester United footballers. Quirky: Parents in Britain are giving their children unusual names, following the example set by model Peaches Geldof, who called her son Astala . The records show that, while quirky baby names have commonly be given by celebrities in the past, families across England and Wales are following suit. While traditional names Harry and Amelia are Britain's most popular, hundreds of more unusual registrations have been recorded. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics reveal that the names Awesome, Marvellous and Excellent were each given to at least three boys in 2011. Boys called Zeus and Billybob appear to have been named after a Greek god and Hollywood actor Billy Bob Thornton respectively. Mother and daughter: Katie Price takes Princess Tiaamii for a haircut in Brighton. The model is not the only celebrity to choose an unusual name . And rock stars also seem to have been a source of inspiration, with boys being named Iggy and Ozzie in a nod to musicians Iggy Pop and Ozzy Osbourne. One family even named their child Jagger-Rock after the lead singer of the Rolling Stones. As well as Tequila, girls' names include Velvet, Ray, Loveday and Comfort. Parents keen to instil good manners in their daughters from an early age have called them Purity, Promise and Justice. Other names registered this year are understood to include Peace, Rogue, River, Serendipity, Diesel-Joe and Rider Zoom. Many celebrities have given their children unusual names, including Coldplay singer Chris Martin and actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who named their daughter Apple. Models Katie Price and Peaches Geldof named their children Princess Tiaamii and Astala respectively. Rock musician Frank Zappa arguably came up with even more outlandish names for his children - Moon Unit, Dweezil, Ahmet and Diva Muffin. But few families could match the parents in New Zealand who were ordered by a judge to change their daughter's name in 2008. They had named her Talula Does the Hula From Hawaii. She was nine years old when the court made its order.

"By . Larisa Brown . A couple who ran a cannabis factory and spent their fortune on helping poor African families and charities have been jailed. Michael Foster, 62, and Susan Cooper, 63, made £400,000 by illegally growing hundreds of plants at their farmhouse home during a six-year operation. But instead of pocketing the money, they spent a large proportion of it on people in a Kenyan village - paying for life-saving surgery, computers for an eye hospital and schooling for poor children. Jailed: Michael Foster, left, and Susan Copper, right, spent the majority of their money made from selling cannabis grown in their farmhouse home on poor people living in a Kenyan village . When the pair, from Lincolnshire, were not helping people in Kenya, they were living an incredible double life selling wholesale kilo deals of cannabis to a local drugs baron. Although the Judge appeared impressed with their good work, they were jailed for three years at Lincoln Crown Court. Prosecutor Jon Dee told the court Foster and Cooper’s life was the 'most unusual cannabis growing case of its type'. He added: 'This couple were both in their 60s and were of previous good character. 'For six years they produced cannabis in significant quantities. This was a ­professional and commercial set up.' Gareth Wheetman, representing Foster, said. 'The very fact they were repeatedly flying off to Kenya in itself required money but the evidence demonstrates much of the money was being put to charitable and good use.' Cooper’s lawyer, Chris Milligan, added: 'Susan Cooper is a good person who has done a bad thing. There is another side to her. In 2004 the couple converted two buildings on their farm in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire into a cannabis factory . 'When a young adult called Wilson got a gangrenous infection in his leg he was given two days to live. She paid for that treatment.' The court heard how the couple were regular visitors to a village in the Kwale district, near the tourist coastal town of Mombasa, Kenya. The couple told police much of the money they illegally obtained was spent helping the local people they met. They used the money to pay for life-saving surgery for people in the village and schooling for the children (file photo) Diani Beach, a tourist hotspot in the Kwale District of Kenya, not too far from where the couple visited regularly . Jailing the couple, Judge Sean Morris told them: 'You were growing it on a significant scale, jetting off to Kenya on it. 'Lots of money was going into your bank accounts, over a number of years hundreds of thousands went in. 'I am sure you were doing good things in Kenya with your drugs money, whether that was to appease your consciences I can only speculate.' In 2004 Foster and Cooper converted . two buildings on their farm in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, into a . cannabis factory, where they grew hundreds of illegal plants and sold . kilos of the drug to a local dealer. Police . only caught the couple by accident when an officer, who happened to . stumble across their home while pursuing a burglar nearby, smelled the . cannabis. Inside police found 159 cannabis plants, worth an estimated £20,000. Two of the buildings . had been converted into a growing room and drying room. Officers also . recovered £20,000 in £1,000 bundles from a carrier bag. Foster and Cooper were arrested and interviewed following the raid in June 2010. Mr Dee added: 'At the time this couple were completely off the police radar. They were caught completely by chance.' When . the officer knocked on the farmhouse door Cooper, a divorcee, answered. She replied 'Yes I do' when the officer asked if she knew why he was . there. The couple admitted four charges of producing cannabis and a single offence of possessing criminal cash.","Pair paid for life-saving surgery, computers in a hospital and schooling .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The controversial Al-Madinah free school is to stop teaching secondary pupils from this summer. The Government has stepped in after an Ofsted report warned that the Muslim faith school in Derby was in chaos, with concerns over teaching quality and the curriculum, amid claims that it was imposing strict Islamic practices such as forcing women to wear headscarves. Schools minister Lord Nash said: ‘It would simply not be in the interests of parents or pupils at the secondary school to continue to fund provision which has failed them in the manner now apparent.’ He said the move would allow the trust in charge to focus on the primary school. Faith: The Al-Madinah School in Derby, which has shut its doors to secondary pupils after the Government stepped in to run it following an Ofsted report which raised concerns over teaching quality and the curriculum . The school opened in September 2012, and within a year was under investigation by the Education Funding Agency over alleged irregularities. In October 2013 Ofsted said it was ‘dysfunctional’. Critics have held the situation up as an example of the problems with the coalition's flagship free schools policy. In a letter to the Al-Madinah Education Trust, Lord Nash said it was 'clear there is a great deal of work to do at the school'. 'I am particularly concerned at the poor quality of secondary teaching and the lack of breadth in the secondary curriculum,' he wrote. 'I have decided it would be in the best interests of those children in the secondary school to continue their education elsewhere from this September onwards.' A member of staff at Al-Madinah: There were claims that it was imposing strict Islamic practices such as forcing women to wear headscarves . A DfE spokesman said: 'The vast majority of free schools are performing well but where we have found failure we have acted swiftly and decisively. 'We have monitored Al-Madinah very closely since problems came to light last year. Based on the current situation we believe the new board - which began work last week - needs to focus efforts on the primary school in order to bring about the level of improvement required. 'The board has accepted our decision to close the secondary school and we have offered our full support in helping pupils to find alternative places before the start of the next academic year.' The newly appointed chair of governors Barry Day, brought in by the Department for Education (DfE) to turn the school around, said the blame lay squarely with the old trust board, which was replaced last week after failing to act. He said it was 'absolutely accurate' to describe the operation of the school, which opened in September 2012, as amateur. Mr Day, who is also chief executive of the Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust, said that the surrounding community still supported Al-Madinah but had been badly let down by the previous trustees, who failed to make improvements following the highly critical Ofsted report published late last year. He said shutting secondary provision would allow the trustees and staff to build the foundations of a good school, and eventually reopen doors to older pupils. Mr Day added: 'The new trustees took over last Friday because the advice about what needed to be done in the school was being ignored by the previous trust and Lord Nash took that action so things could actually start moving. 'I think the closure is a real blow for the local community but it does give the new trust members the chance to turn things around. 'It is about laying the foundation and I believe because we can focus on building up a new primary for the next three-and-a-half years it now has a much greater chance of being successful.' He said there were now less than 140 secondary pupils on the roll and the new governing body had been speaking with the council about finding alternative places for these youngsters. Mr Day said the dysfunction between the staff and management meant 'many of them (staff) felt they couldn't do their job because of interference by others'. He added: 'Every single member of staff wants this school to be successful but there is absolutely no doubt that many of the staff are inexperienced, some of the staff are not qualified and all of them need additional training to make this work.' Mr Day said his sympathies were with the parents and wider community who had invested a lot of support in the school. 'I believe they've been let down by the previous trustees - they're responsible for the position the school is in and it's up to myself and the new board and other experts that will come in to drive this forward,' he said. Farce: Newly appointed chair of governors Barry Day said there was no doubt that many of the staff are inexperienced, some of the staff are not qualified and all of them need additional training 'to make this work' Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'This is more evidence that David Cameron's free school programme is damaging education standards in this country. 'Ofsted judged that Al-Madinah, one of the Prime Minister's flagship free schools, is completely dysfunctional. 'It has come to symbolise everything that is wrong with the free school programme: unqualified teachers in the classroom and a complete lack of local oversight of these schools. 'Despite the continuing evidence that this programme is damaging standards, the Tory-led government is happy to plough on.' Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'Once again Education Secretary Michael Gove has a lot of questions to answer about his flagship free school policy. 'It is becoming increasingly apparent that the process for approving groups to open free schools is inadequate and that in his haste to open these schools, procedures for ensuring that providers deliver the highest standards of education are not in place. 'The free school programme must be paused so that the lessons of troubled schools such as the Discovery Free School, Al-Madinah and the King's Science Academy can be learned. 'Free schools should be brought within the responsibility of their local authority to ensure proper oversight of both their governance and the standard of education they offer.'","Al-Madinah free school was mired on controversy when it was claimed that teachers had been forced to wear headscarves .

"By . Associated Press . An Army soldier confessed that he killed his pregnant wife by persuading her to wear handcuffs during sex and then suffocating her with a plastic bag over her head, according to the testimony of his former Army buddy heard during his court martial. Prosecutors at Fort Stewart on Monday used testimony alleging the confession to open their case against 22-year-old Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, who is charged with murder as well as killing an unborn child. He faces an automatic life sentence if a military judge convicts him of murder in the July 17, 2011, death of Sgt. Deirdre Aguigui. Charged: Soldier Pvt. Isaac Aguigui (pictured here in 2013) faces an automatic life sentence if a military judge convicts him of murder in the July 17, 2011, death of Sgt. Deirdre Aguigui . Tragic loss: Pvt. Isaac Aguigui allegedly confessed to killing his pregnant wife Sgt. Deidre Aguigui, 24 (pictured left and right) in 2011 . Capt. Janae Lapir, an Army prosecutor, said in her opening statement that Isaac Aguigui wanted to be free from a rocky marriage and coveted the $500,000 in life insurance and benefit payments he received from the Army after his wife was found dead in their apartment on the southeast Georgia Army post. She called him 'a schemer' who tricked his wife into letting him handcuff her. 'Sgt. Aguigui never had a chance to fight back because she never saw it coming,' Lapir said. Civilian prosecutors say Aguigui used the insurance money to buy guns and bomb components for an anti-government militia group, F.E.A.R. (short for Forever Enduring Always Ready), which he started by recruiting other disgruntled soldiers. F.E.A.R members had stockpiled assault weapons and bomb components and discussed plotting attacks on a crowded landmark in nearby Savannah, poisoning the apple crop in Washington State and even assassinating President Barack Obama. Slain: Michael Roark, 19 (left) and Tiffany York, 17 (right) were found shot in the head in December 2011 . Aguigui is already facing the death penalty in the state of Georgia after he was charged with ordering the cold-blooded murder of soldier Michael Roark, 19, and his girlfriend Tiffany York, 17, in December 2011 - eight months after he allegedly killed his wife. The young couple were found shot in the head near Fort Stewart. Aguigui pleaded guilty in a civilian . court last summer to murder charges in the slayings, saying he feared the soldier would turn on F.E.A.R. Investigators also  three other soldiers â€” Sgt. Anthony Peden, Pvt. Christopher Salmon and Pfc. Michael Burnett â€” and charged them in the deaths. Salmon and Peden, who prosecutors say fired the killing shots, are still awaiting trial. Charged: Isaac Aguigui (left) and Michael Christopher Salmon (right) were charged in the deaths of a 19-year-old soldier and his 17-year-old girlfriend in 2011 . Charged: Michael Burnett (left) and Anthony Peden (right) were charged in the deaths of a 19-year-old soldier and his 17-year-old girlfriend in 2011 . Friends of the Army couple testified Wednesday about constant fighting in their marriage over Aguigui's drug use and infidelities by both husband and wife. Deirdre Aguigui, 24, was about seven-months-pregnant when she died, and friends said her husband had questioned whether the child was his. Testimony in pretrial hearings showed the Army was delayed in bringing charges because the military's autopsy failed to identify a cause of death for Deirdre Aguigui. Last year, a Georgia state medical examiner reviewed the case and gave a second opinion, saying she must have been choked or suffocated because every other potential cause could be ruled out. He noted marks on her wrists indicated she struggled violently as her hands were cuffed behind her back. 'She had kicked him out of the house . for reasons of infidelity and drug use,' said Chief Warrant Officer . Justin Kapinus, an Army criminal investigator, said of the pair last . year. 'It was very evident they had a rough marriage.' Aguigui . called 911 on the evening of July 17, 2011, saying he found his wife . unconscious and unresponsive on the couch, with chunks of a potato she'd . eaten for dinner in her mouth, Kapinus said. Kapinus . testified in a preliminary hearing that initial results of an autopsy . on Deirdre Aguigui were inconclusive. A second look by a medical examiner for the Georgia Bureau . of Investigation concluded someone killed the woman by choking her or . otherwise blocking her airway, Kapinus said. On trial: Sgt Anthony Peden (left) and Private Aguigui (right) were led away after being accused of murdering another soldier and his girlfriend to keep their militia's plans secret in 2011 . When . she died, Deirdre Aguigui had small cuts and abrasions on her wrists . and investigators found a pair of handcuffs on the bed, Kapinus said. The bed was also covered with sex toys, leg restraints and other . paraphernalia. The investigator said Isaac Aguigui told investigators he . and his wife had used the handcuffs and other items during sex a few . hours earlier. Kapinus said he suspects the bedroom scene was staged. He . said, 'It seemed excessive.' Aguigui's friend Michael Schaefer testified that Aguigui at first told him his wife died from a blood clot. About a month later, after they had been up all night using cocaine, they got into an argument. Schaefer said he asked his friend point-blank what really happened to his wife. 'He told me he had strangled her with a bag,' Schaefer said. 'He handcuffed her, put a bag over her head and strangled her' while also sexually assaulting her. Capt. Scott Noto, one of Aguigui's defense attorneys, noted that Schaefer never mentioned a confession during several previous interviews with Army investigators or when he testified at a pre-trial hearing for Aguigui last summer. Schaefer said he was afraid to speak up until Army prosecutors granted him immunity from prosecution in Deirdre Aguigui's death. Investigators said the young couple had been separated until not long before Mrs Guigui, a promising Army linguist, died. 'She had kicked him out of the house for reasons of infidelity and drug use,' said Chief Warrant Officer Justin Kapinus, an Army criminal investigator. 'It was very evident they had a rough marriage.' Charged: Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, pictured at his preliminary hearing on August 30, 2012, was accused by prosecutors in 2011 of plotting attacks as leader of an anti-government militia group . Aguigui called 911 on the evening of July 17, 2011, saying he found his wife unconscious and unresponsive on the couch, with chunks of a potato she'd eaten for dinner in her mouth, Kapinus said. The investigator said about eight hours before Aguigui's wife died, he had sent a text message from his cellphone to an old girlfriend that said: 'We'll have plenty of money.' Lieutenant Colonel Kristin Brown, an Army obstetrician who treated Aguigui's wife during her pregnancy, testified that she had complained that her husband had been unfaithful and that they planned to get a divorce. Investigators also learned that Deirdre Aguigui had sought confidential counseling for domestic abuse.

"By . Ted Thornhill . The reputation of Boeing’s Dreamliner took another blow when a passenger on one of the aircraft spotted fuel gushing from the wing as it taxied for take-off. The Norwegian Airlines 787 was preparing to take off from Bangkok on a journey to Oslo on Sunday when passenger Ann Kristin Balto saw that fuel was leaking on to the runway. She immediately alerted a stewardess and the flight was cancelled. Scroll down for video . She told The Local: ‘We started to point out the window, so that the the stewardess became aware of it, and she looked out of the window and picked up the phone. I don’t know who she called but the plane stopped immediately afterwards.’ A Norwegian spokesman told Reuters that the leak was caused by a problem with a fuel valve. Norwegian's press spokesman Charlotte Holmbergh Jacobsson told The Local that passengers were never in danger because the fuel leak would have registered on the pilots' instrument panel. Passengers were taken off the plane, which was taken out of service. The flight departed 19 hours later and the jet was later sent to a maintenance facility in Stockholm. Norwegian said it did not have more detail about the problem because Boeing is responsible for maintenance of the airline's 787 fleet. Boeing said it was working with Norwegian Air on the issue. Video courtesy of Harold Saive . Norwegian has admitted that the reliability of its 787 fleet has not been satisfactory . More problems: Staff inspect a grounded All Nippon Airways (ANA) Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Haneda airport in Tokyo, Japan, following an incident with a leaking battery in early 2013. The 787 Dreamliner model of US aircraft producer Boeing has suffered a series heightened safety concerns, which led airlines all over the world to temporarily ground their Dreamliner fleets in 2013 . For every 100 Dreamliner flights, three are unable to leave on time due to mechanical issues with the plane. The incident is one of a number of problems that 787 operators have experienced with Boeing's newest jetliner. Just over a year after the 787 began commercial operation in late 2011, the worldwide fleet was grounded in January 2013 after lithium-ion batteries overheated on two 787 jets in less than two weeks. In October, Norwegian Chief Executive Bjorn Kjos praised the jet's flying performance and fuel efficiency, but expressed concern that the airline was forced to take one of the new $200 million jets out of service for two weeks and lease an alternative jet because of problems with a hydraulic pump.Boeing redesigned the pump to solve the problem. Last week, a battery melted and emitted smoke from a parked 787 Dreamliner operated by Japan Airlines. The incident at Tokyo Narita airport caused the jet to be taken out of service. The fuel leak on the Norwegian jet in Bangkok, and other incidents, have combined to lower the plane's ability to consistently depart on time on scheduled flights. Most older aircraft are highly reliable, able to leave the gate on time more than 99 percent of the time. In October, Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney said the company was ‘making good progress’ on improving the reliability of the 787, but that he was not yet satisfied with the performance, which was about 97 per cent on time. That means for every 100 flights, three are unable to leave on time due to mechanical issues with the plane. Norwegian did not provide a reliability level, but spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said that recently the ‘overall reliability of our 787 fleet has not been satisfactory.’ July 28 2012: A fan shaft fails during runway tests in South Carolina .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The U.S. Supreme Court said Tuesday that Christian firms can challenge an Obamacare mandate that forces employers to offer their staff free contraception as part of their health insurance. Hobby Lobby, a crafting supply store owned by a family that also runs a chain of Christian bookstores, sued the federal government over Obamacare's requirement that every health insurance policy include coverage for the morning-after pill and intra-uterine contraceptive devices, without requiring pharmacy co-payments from consumers. Now about 40 similar plaintiffs are involved, arguing that since their religious beliefs hold that human life begins at conception, they can't be forced to provide birth-control that prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman's uterus. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hobby Lobby owners David and Barbara Green say they want to operate their business according to their Christian faith. That includes not providing employees with forms of contraception that they believe ends human life . The Hobby Lobby case won't revisit the legality of abortion, guaranteed in the Roe v. Wade court decision, but it will likely determine whether a private company has to provide health insurance that includes drugs some groups see as 'abortion pills' The Green family closes all its Hobby Lobby stores on Sundays in observance of their Christian faith, but they say the Affordable Care Act prohibits them from exercising other facts of their religious freedom . Hobby Lobby employs 13,000 people. Its owners do not object to condoms, diaphragms and other  forms of contraception. But they face fines of up to $1.3 million per day if they don't provide their workers with a health insurance plan that complies with the Affordable Care Act, beginning with the first day of a new insurance plan year. They have avoided paying the fine so far by shifting their group plan's renewal date. Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp, another named plaintiff, objects mainly to the 'Plan B' contraceptive pill and other similar medications. The company is owned by a Mennonite family. Autocam Corp., a Michigan company that makes auto parts and medical equipment, objects to the law because its owners are Roman Catholic and oppose all forms of birth control. In dueling press releases, the Obama administration and conservative activists sparred over the arguments that the high court will likely hear in March. Susan B. Anthony's List, an anti-abortion group, focused on what it called the administration's 'abortion-drug mandate.' The group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in a statement that '[w]e applaud the Supreme Court for taking up this case addressing our fundamental freedom of religion and conscience, During the debate over the Affordable Care Act, Americans were assured that these rights would be honored, but as Obamacare is rolled out, we see this is simply not the case.' Plan B: This 'emergency contraceptive' is really an abortion drug, many Christian groups claim. They object to Obamacare's requirement that all health insurance policies cover the pills . Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser warns about threats to Americans' 'fundamental freedom of religion and conscience' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday in a statement that '[w]e believe this requirement is lawful and essential to womenâ€™s health, and are confident the Supreme Court will agree,' referring to the inclusion of contraceptives among the Affordable Care Act's 'ten essential services.' 'The Administration has already acted to ensure no church or similar religious institution will be forced to provide contraception coverage and has made a commonsense accommodation for non-profit religious organizations that object to contraception on religious grounds,' Carney said. Not an issue? Condoms and other forms of birth control aren't part of Hobby Lobby's objection, but one Catholic plaintiff has a problem with being required to provide employees with any form of birth control . But the issue before the Supreme Court is whether private businesses, not churches and their related charities, can operate in a way that reflects their faith. Hobby Lobby already shutters its stores on Sundays and closes at 8:00 p.m. each night so its employees can be at home when their children go to bed. In a video produced in 2012 by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, Hobby Lobby co-founder Barbara Green said her family's religious faith is 'a part of our life that is â€“ we can't separate it from our work.' David Green, her husband and the company's CEO, added that 'my convictions enter into how we run our business.' He said Tuesday in a statement that his legal challenge 'has always remained . about one thing and one thing only: the right of our family businesses . to live out our sincere and deeply held religious convictions as . guaranteed by the law and the Constitution.' 'Business owners should not . have to choose between violating their faith and violating the law.' In 1993 Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, limiting the federal government's ability to enforce laws that constitute a religious burden to Americans. Last year the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that corporations can be equally protected by that law, writing that 'the contraceptive-coverage requirement substantially burdens Hobby Lobby.' The U.S. Supreme Court said it will decide whether religious freedoms trump the Obama administration's desire to make sure all Americans have access to free birth control, regardless of where they work . The Obama administration has already carved out exceptions to the law for churches and their charities, like this hospital, but no such help is available to private businesses owned by the Christian faithful . The Obama administration argues that letting that ruling stand would remove health protections from citizens who happen to work for companies run by the religiously observant. In addition to deciding whether or not 'corporate persons' can assert the 1993 law's protections when they clash with other federal laws, the case could produce the Supreme Court's first abortion-related decision since 2007 when it upheld the federal Partial Birth Abortion Act. Different medical authorities disagree on the definition of a pregnancy. Some, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, argue that pregnancy begins when a fertilized egg is implanted in the womb. The Catholic Medical Association and other like-minded organizations, however, say life begins at conception. 'Emergency contraception,' they claim, can kill a living human being.","Employers sued the government on religious grounds, arguing they shouldn't have to offer insurance that covers the Plan B pill .
The case will touch on the thorny question of whether life begins when sperm meets egg .
The White House doesn't want religiously observant business owners to be allowed to limit their employees' health care choices .
The companies insist that they should be allowed to operate in accordance with their faiths ."

"By . Damien Gayle . An artist has created a unique homage to the world's political, cultural and historical icons - by immortalising them as Star Wars characters. Mike Leavitt, from Vashon Island near Seattle, Washington, wanted to 'document the pulse of our times' through sculpture by splicing the fictional characters with famous faces. Although he chose a sci-fi saga as a basis for what he calls his 'pop culture satirical mash-ups', he says he sees himself working in the same tradition of Greco-Roman statuary. 'You Don't Rebel Walk Scum Away': The title sculptor Mike Leavitt from Vashon Island near Seattle, Washington, chose for his sculpture re-imagining Hillary Clinton as a Galactic Empire Stormtrooper . 'Pop culture satirical mash-ups': Albert Einstein, right, as R2D2, and Steve Jobs as C3PO. Mr Leavitt says his intention with the bizarre hybrid representations was to 'document the pulse of our times' Heroes of the Rebel Alliance: U.S. President Barack Obama is represented left as Lando Calrissian, while Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is spliced with Princess Leia, right . The bizarre results include Albert Einstein as R2D2, Steve Jobs as C3PO, Barack Obama as Lando Calrissian and Aung San Suu Kyi as Princess Leia. The figures are in various sizes and many of them are hand-carved from wood. The largest are up to three-feet tall and all are hand painted with oil-based enamel. Just like the classic Star Wars toys, they are made with articulated joints so they can be posed in different positions. And many also come with removable accessories. 'You underestimate the power of the dark side': Former boxer Mike Tyson, left,  is represented as Darth Maul, Sarah Palin, centre, is a dark lord of the Sith, and Donald Trump, right, is shown as Darth Vader . Mahatma Ghandi is spliced with wise Jedi teacher Master Yoda . Mr Leavitt, who says he sees himself as an anthropologist working in sculpture, says the works are inspired by the parallels he sees between the classical era and our present-day civilisation. He says he is particularly struck by the sense that modern Western culture may be going the way of the Greeks and Romans. It seems that, to an extent, Mr Leavitt's own political persuasions have influenced his choice of representations. Liberal heroes like Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama and Aung San Suu Kyi are spliced with characters from Star Wars' Rebel Alliance, while conservative or controversial figures like Sarah Palin, Donald Trump and Mike Tyson are shown as characters from the tyrannical Galactic Empire. Mr Leavitt's Empire Peaks exhibition is at New York's Jonathan LeVine Gallery until 28 December 2013. The 36-year-old sculptor explained: 'I . was inspired to create the Empire Peaks series because I was seeing . direct parallels between history and the present. What's the origin of this species? Chewbacca is given the heavily bearded face of evolutionist Charles Darwin, left. In the right-hand picture chat show queen Oprah Winfrey is shown as Padme Amidala . Four score and seven years ago, in a galaxy far, far away... Abraham Lincoln is re-imagined left as a laser gun-toting Han Solo. Hollywood star Angelina Jolie is Princess Leia in her slave girl outfit, right . Mr Leavitt poses with his sculpture of Che Guevara as Star Wars bounty hunter Boba Fett: He says the works are inspired by the parallels he sees between the classical era and our present-day civilisation . 'I think of my statues as if they are Greco-Roman totems saluting the titans of our contemporary culture. I wonder if the modern dynasties of American, Christian and Western Civilization are falling the way of the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians. 'From this fascination I decided to re-appropriate the classic sculpture archetypes of these ancient civilizations to a completely present-day context. 'I chose the celebrity likenesses for Empire Peaks based on a well-refined selection process. I've sculpted figures of famous people for over a decade. I think of myself as an anthropologist documenting the pulse of our times in sculpture. 'Choosing the Empire Peaks non-fiction characters followed this impulse. Though my previous Art Army project represented artists exclusively. I wanted Empire Peaks to represent the architects of modern culture as a whole. 'Some of the ""empires"" are more cultural, some more political, some topple dynasties and create new ones in the process. 'Whatever the case, each character is complicit in carving out large swaths of our cultural landscape.' Painstaking: Mr Leavitt puts the finishing touches to Martin Luther Kind as a Jedi knight, left. The right hand picture shows him finishing the sculpture of Steve Jobs as C3PO with real wires . Hours of painstaking work went into each of Mr Leavitt's statues, which are made of wood and polymer clay then hand-finished in enamel paints. He said: 'I hand-carved many of the Empire Peaks statues in wood. Every piece in the show has 5 moving body parts at 4 points of articulation. Articulating the statues like this is designed to satirise the Star Wars elements of the mash-ups. 'The largest pieces, standing about three feet tall, are completely carved from scratch in wood. I hand-paint them with oil-based enamel. I sculpted the medium-size statues, about one-and-a-half feet, in wood with polymer clay details in the hands and face. I sculpted the one-foot tall figures in polymer clay. 'I've hidden and hand-painted many tiny details in these smaller figures. All the statues include removable accessories. These accessories and moving body parts are also designed practically to aid in shipping. 'Every statue can be completely dismantled to ease the transport.'","Sculptor Mike Leavitt says he was inspired by Greco-Roman statuary .

Mr Farage was in the city to campaign with UKIP candidate Otto Inglis who is standing in a by-election to the Scottish Parliament. He had been canvassing in the Aberdeen Donside seat and planned to finish the day with a pint int the Staging Post pub in Bucksburn.

Confrontation: Mr Farage had tried to talk to the group but was targetted with a fizzy drink as he walked into the pub . After a day on the campaign trail with around 30 UKIP activists, Mr Farage had gone to the pub for his trademark pint at around 6pm. He went outside to speak to a small group of protesters, who had been chanting 'fascist' at UKIP members. He spoke to them for around quarter of an hour before deciding to return to his pint.

I've never come across anything like it in all of my life anywhere in Britain, Europe or the world for that matter. ‘The idea that you can disagree with someone's point of view but you have it out and debate these things and let the public judge is what the democratic process is all about. There is something quite unpleasant going on. ‘I think frankly the police are a little bit nervous, because some of the things that happened in Edinburgh were really quite nasty.’","Fizzy drink flung over UKIP leader and colleagues as they walked into pub .

'Riley and Erin just sat there with my phone, watching, and they were like ""oh my god dad, you went viral,""' he recalled, laughing. But all Kovalcik really wanted was for Coleman to know the impact he'd had. 'I just wanted to show him what he had done,' he told MailOnline. 'He inspired my daughters but it's a great thing he's doing not just for hearing impaired kids or kids with other disabilities, he's showing all kids that if you work hard and you dedicate yourself whatever deficiencies you have, you can be great.

"By . Leon Watson . The brother of . Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius is facing charges over the death of a . woman in a car crash in 2010, it emerged today. Carl Pistorius, who was present in court over the past week to support . Oscar, is charged with culpable homicide over the alleged accidental . death of a female motorcyclist. He appeared in court just two days before his brother's bail hearing last week and was represented by the same lawyer as his brother, the highly-respected advocate Kenny Oldwage. The crash allegedly happened in Vanderbijlpark in South Africa's Gauteng province, an hour's drive south of Johannesburg. It also emerged today that police told Reeva's family that Oscar Pistorius crushed his girlfriend’s skull with a cricket bat before shooting her dead. Scroll down for video . Charged: Carl Pistorius, brother of Olympian athlete, Oscar Pistorius, arrives at home today . Charged: Carl Pistorius, with sister Aimee, in court to see their brother Oscar granted bail after being charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . Paralympian Oscar Pistorius is at home after being granted bail following a gruelling four-day hearing . Carl was initially accused of reckless or negligent driving, but the matter was later provisionally withdrawn. However, the charges were reinstated after the victim's family said they believed it was more than an accident, Eye Witness News reported. It is claimed police conducted tests on Carl Pistorius' blood at the time . of the accident, and he was found not to have been drinking alcohol. In Britain the equivalent charge to . culpable homicide is manslaughter. Carl Pistorius' trial is set to begin . at the end of March. The brothers' lawyer Mr Oldwage successfully defended Sizwe Mankazana, who was charged with culpable homicide, reckless and negligent driving and driving under the influence of alcohol after he lost control of his vehicle, killing Nelson Mandela's 13-year-old great-grandchild Zenani in 2010. It has also emerged that the athlete sported a mysterious black eye in a video filmed a month ago for a charity campaign. The Paralympian lent his support to a South African ­campaign for gay and lesbian youth. But charity bosses were surprised when he turned up for filming with a black eye. In the video message recorded to raise awareness for the It Gets Better campaign in South Africa, Oscar instructed young people who were being bullied about their sexuality to 'not retaliate'. Oscar Pistorius claims he shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead by accident believing her to be an intruder at his home . An It Gets Better charity source told . the Sunday Mirror: 'Oscar turned up on the day of filming with a very . angry ­looking black eye. 'Oscar . was keen for the filming to still go ahead and didn’t seem to mind too . much. Although eyebrows were raised, Oscar wasn’t forthcoming on how he . managed to get the injury.' Oscar Pistorius, meanwhile, spent Saturday at his uncle's home in an . affluent suburb of Pretoria, the South African capital, after a  judge released him on bail  on Friday. While on bail, he is expected to take delivery of a £200,000 supercar. He ordered the 204mph 3.8-liter McLaren MP4-12C Spider last month as a treat to reward himself for a successful year, The Sun reported today. Oscar Pistorius has been charged with premeditated murder in the shooting death of . girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day. But the athlete denies murder, saying he killed her accidentally. He . says he opened fire after mistaking Miss Steenkamp for an intruder in . his home. Details of the post-mortem examination of South African model Steenkamp were withheld from last week’s bail application hearing. But grieving relatives who saw her body before Tuesday’s cremation in Port Elizabeth described horrific injuries from the cricket bat, and entry wounds from 9mm bullets fired by Pistorius. They were also briefed about the model’s death by police and lawyers from the state prosecutor’s office. In a sworn affidavit read to the bail hearing in Pretoria magistrates’ court last week, Pistorius claimed that he used the bat to break down the toilet door after the shooting, saying he had not realised his girlfriend was in  the bathroom. The bloodstained bat, which is currently being examined by a police forensics team, will be key evidence when Pistorius goes on trial for premeditated murder. The ‘Blade Runner’ – who has previously boasted about having a cricket bat, pistol and machine gun at home to defend himself against intruders – claims the bat became blood-spattered at the scene. Last week the prosecution did not mention any details about the bat and the role they believe it played in Reeva’s death, opting not to disclose their case against Pistorius. But to secure bail, Pistorius’s legal team had to detail his defence, which included why he had a blood-spattered cricket bat in his possession on the fatal night. Lawyer Kenny Oldwage and Carl Pistorius, brother of Oscar Pistorius arrive at the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria. It has emerged Mr Oldwage is representing both brothers . Carl Pistorius appeared in court just two days before his brother's bail hearing last week . Oscar Pistorius' brother Carl and his father Henke look more positive at the end of the third day of the runner's murder bail hearing . Oscar Pistorius' brother Carl tries to avoid the media flurry outside Pretoria Magistrates' Court . The athlete claims that during the . night he heard a noise in the bathroom and feared it was an intruder. Pistorius, 26, said he felt ‘vulnerable’ without his prosthetic legs, so . he got a gun from under his bed and fired through the bathroom door, . shouting at the ‘intruder’ to get out of the house and for Reeva to call . the police. At that point Pistorius thought she was still in bed. Pistorius . described his ‘horror and fear’ as he realised Reeva was not in the . bed, and said he used the bat to break down the toilet door to find . Reeva slumped inside the cubicle. He said he called paramedics and then carried Reeva, 29, downstairs, trying to revive her, but she died in his arms. The Observer reported today that the uncle of Pistorius, Arnold Pistorius, has said the star will try to make contact with Reeva's grieving family. 'We don't want to put him under pressure but while we were in the car, that is what he said,' Arnold told eNews Channel Africa. 'The family of Reeva is in his mind all the time and he knows his purpose would be to be part of the family in future.' A message purporting to be from 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius to his fans thanking them for their support was a fake, the Olympian's family said tonight. The athlete, released on bail yesterday after being charged with premeditated murder over the Valentine's Day death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, has not issued any public comments. It was thought that a message on his elder brother Carl's Twitter account was penned by the double amputee, but a spokeswoman later said this was not the case and that the account had been hacked. The message, thanking 'every person that has prayed for both families' and signed by 'Osca' was posted using the @carlpistorius handle. Pistorius family spokeswoman Janine Hills said: 'Carl did not tweet this afternoon, out of respect to Oscar and Reeva. We are busy cancelling all the social media sites for both Oscar's brother and his sister.' As of this evening, Carl Pistorius's Twitter account had been taken down while those belonging to his brother and sister Aimee remained. Yesterday, . Reeva’s father Barry Steenkamp said that the athlete would have to . ‘live with his  conscience’ if he is lying about how he killed her. He told Afrikaans-language newspaper . Beeld: ‘It doesn’t matter how much money he has and how good his team of . lawyers is, he must be able to live with his conscience if he allows . his team of lawyers to lie on his behalf. ‘He will have to live with his . conscience. But if he speaks the truth, I can perhaps someday forgive . him. If it does not happen as he tells it, he must suffer.’ In . another interview, Reeva’s mother June said: ‘Everything  has been . taken away from me in such a terrible way. The only thing that matters . now is the truth.’ Pistorius’s family believe him  to be . innocent, with his father Henke saying he had ‘zero doubt’ that Reeva’s . death was a tragic accident. In an earlier interview, Henke said: ‘When . you are a sportsman, you act even more  on instinct. It’s instinct, things happen and that’s what you do. ‘When you wake up in the middle of the night, and crime is so endemic in South Africa, what do you do if somebody is in the house? Do you think it’s one of your  family? No, of course you don’t.’ In a statement yesterday Pistorius’s family said: ‘Oscar will never be the same ...  having to live with the knowledge he caused the death of the woman he loved, and that he can never undo the immense pain and loss this has caused Reeva’s family and friends.’ Having been released from bail after the gruelling four-day hearing, Pistorius was yesterday spending the day with his family at a secret address in Pretoria provided by his legal team. His uncle Arnold Pistorius said: ‘We are convinced Oscar’s version of what happened that terrible night will prove to be true.’ Today, if his athletics coach Ampie Louw has his way, Pistorius could be back in training at the track at the University of Pretoria. He was last there earlier this month with Reeva, who watched admiringly as he was put through his paces. Friends have spoken of the need for a suicide watch on the sportsman as he spends the next four months preparing for his court appearance on June 4. Meanwhile, South Africa’s top detective Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo is taking over the role of chief investigator in the case, after Hilton Botha stepped down from the post. Detective Botha resigned after seven charges of attempted murder against him were reinstated. He and three other officers shot at a minibus of escaping murder suspects in 2009.

"By . Belinda Robinson . U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama kept up her charm offensive in China by visiting the site of the terracotta warriors – but briefly talked about politics calling on the Chinese government to open up the internet to all of its citizens. The First Lady, along with daughters Sasha 12, and Malia 15, watched a folk dance by local performers during her visit to the City Wall, in Xi'an, Shaanxi province and later joined in by dancing and skipping rope, much to the delight of her Chinese hosts. The family also came face-to-face with China’s terracotta warriors on Monday on a week-long tour of several major sites while the First Lady carefully skirted political issues.

The . site houses 8,000 life-size warriors left by China's first emperor Qin . Shi Huang who reigned in the 3rd century BC, a hugely popular tourist . attraction that saw five million visitors last year. Since her arrival in Beijing on Thursday night Mrs Obama has focused on talking about soft issues.

Fashion forward: Mrs Obama looked to have co-ordinated her wardrobe with that of her eldest daughter with both she and Malia sporting black skinny trousers and wearing their hair in loose curls . Speaking to a mixture of 200 Chinese and American students, Mrs Obama spent much of her speech promoting the values of study-abroad programs. However, she was also keen to praise the power of the internet for its ability to spread freedom. She did not mention issues about censorship or the fact that the Chinese government blocks social-media sites like Twitter and Facebook. China has developed its own brand of social media sites like Weibo or Weixin which are extremely popular, in the absence of any other social media platforms. Mrs Obama also warned that a government should not shield itself from criticism. She said: ‘That’s how we decide which values and ideas we think are best—by questioning and debating them vigorously, by listening to all sides of the argument and by judging for ourselves.’ Lesson: The family were told of the history of the The Terracotta Army or the 'Terracotta Warriors and Horses', a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China . Up close: The family and their tour guides get up close to the world famous statues as their tour guide shows them around the historic site . Educational visit: Mrs Obama, her mother and her two young daughters looked relaxed and were dressed casually as they made their way around the ancient models . ‘And believe me, I know how this can be a messy and frustrating process. My husband and I are on the receiving end of plenty of questioning and criticism from our media and our fellow citizens, and it’s not always easy but we wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.’ ‘Because time and time again, we have seen that countries are stronger and more prosperous when the voices and opinions of all citizens can be heard,’ she said. While Ms Obama’s trip has been largely successful, on Sunday, her motorcade was met with jeers from two people outside the U.S. embassy in Beijing. Police and men in grey sweatshirts hurried to subdue the protestors, and it was unclear why they were shouting. In addition to her trips to see the Terracotta army, Mrs Obama and her daughters strolled along the Great Wall of China to the north of the capital to view another breathtaking Chinese monument. Vendors at the tourist site appeared to have removed T-shirts that are typically on sale showing President Obama in a Mao hat, with one merchant revealing a boxful of the souvenirs stored in the back of her tent. The Terracotta Army or the 'Terracotta Warriors and Horses', is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BC and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife. The figures, dating from around the late third century BC, were discovered in 1974 by local farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi province. The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. Three pits containing the Terracotta Army hold over 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which are still buried in the pits chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which are still buried in the pits near by Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. Other terracotta non-military figures were also found in other pits and they include officials, acrobats, strongmen and musicians. The Terracotta Army was discovered on 29 March 1974 to the east of Xi’An in Shaanxi province by a group of farmers when they were digging a water well around one mile east of the Qin Emperor's tomb mound at Mount li (Lishan)a region riddled with underground springs and watercourses. For centuries, there had been occasional reports of pieces of terracotta figures and fragments of the Qin necropolis– roofing tiles, bricks, and chunks of masonry – having been dug up in the area.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . When journalists saw first lady Michelle Obama on Sunday during her visit to the Great Wall of China, the few photographers permitted to see the event were forbidden to shoot from an angle that would have produced an unfortunate photo, framing her and her family with a decades-old rock sculpture that reads 'loyal to Chairman Mao.' Instead, photojournalists were forced to remain on a Wall tower between Mrs. Obama and the 1,300-foot-wide carving, making that photo impossible to take. 'Photographers and reporters covering the visit were sent ahead to Tower 15' on the Wall, according to a pool report, 'and told they could not move from the top of the tower until told to do so.' Scroll down for video . On a hillside near the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall of China, a carved stone inscription (top) reads 'loyal to Chairman Mao.' During the first lady's visit, photographers were kept away from a vantage point that would have allowed them to capture the Obamas in a photo like this . Mrs. Obama (L) walked with her daughters Malia (R) and Sasha (C) on the Great Wall at Mutianyu, but the only photographers on the scene were forced to stay between the Obamas and the communist loyalty message . The stones, stacked by Red Guards in the late 1960s, were covered with brush until 2008, when the government cleared the vegetation and repainted them in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics . 'Because of where we were positioned,' the pool journalist wrote, 'they could only be photographed with scenery to the south of Tower 15. Had photographers been able to shoot from Tower 14 as the family walked north, the photographs would have captured them walking the wall with a massive rock inscription on the hillside above them to the north, which read in Chinese characters, ""Loyal to Chairman Mao.""' This reporter visited the same section of the Great Wall in the summer of 2009, and photographed the rock inscription. A tour guide who visits the Great Wall at least once each week said at the time that Red Guards had built the inscription out of quarried stone in the late 1960s and painted them white with lime. But in the 40 years that followed, the paint wore away and brush grew to cover the rocks. Just months before the 2008 Summer Olympics, Chinese government officials ordered a refurbishment of the site. Vegetation was removed and the rocks were repainted. Reached for comment, the tour guide told MailOnline that she was on the same section of the Wall on Saturday, the day before the Obamas arrived. 'I had a client and we went up on the Mutianyu section,' she said, 'and one of the gondola operators told me he had been instructed to make sure the first lady's family wasn't traveling up to the top until the security guards told him everything was all set' – likely meaning that the press was situated in their prescribed place. Forbidden: T-shirts like this were yanked from sale in peddlers' stalls near the Great Wall when the Obamas came to visit . Carefully scripted: The first lady's visit to the Great Wall was choreographed by U.S. and Chinese security forces, with order maintained by local government police . Watchful eye: Access to the Mutianyu section of the Wall was controlled by security forces while the Obamas were there . Secret Service agents, including some Asian-Americans, watched closely as Michelle Obama and her daughters walked with a group of pre-screened tourists. (Can you spot them?) 'This happens when important people visit. We don't want to take to them to the Badaling section of the Wall because it is too crowded. They can't shoo everyone away, and they also can't protect the dignitaries,' she added. 'It's difficult.' The all-seeing eyes: Secret Service were carefully positioned in front of the Obamas and behind them at every step . 'But [the] Mutianyu [section], you know, has the Mao rock carving. So that becomes difficult as well, especially for Westerners. I'm sure the photographers were forbidden from taking an embarrassing picture.' News outlets had a field day on Sunday with a dispatch from the same pool reporter that noted how vendors near the Wall at Mutianyu were instructed to hide popular t-shirts merging President Barack Obama and People's Republic of China founder Mao Zedong. Mrs. Obama's hotel stay in Beijing was also marked by controversy, with a well-placed staffer at the Westin Chaoyang telling MailOnline that her mother had been 'barking at the staff since she arrived.' The careful scripting of the first lady's China trip stands in stark contrast with a statement she made to the Chinese news outlet Caixin Online before the journey began. 'We get plenty of questioning and criticism from our media and our fellow citizens – but we wouldn't trade it for anything in the world,' she said.' Mrs. Obama hasn't taken any questions from journalists since she landed in China.","The first lady, traveling with her mother and daughters, visited a section of the Great Wall of China on Sunday .

"By . Mark Prigg . Sony is expected to reveal a radical VR headset for its PlayStayion 4 games console next month. The addon would allow people to play games in 3D, and give Sony a major boost in its battle against Microsoft's Xbox One. It would build on TV and movie watching headsets Sony showed off at the CES show in Las Vegas earlier this year. Scroll down for video . An earlier VR headset from Sony designed to watch movies. The firm is now expected to reveal a version for its PS4 console . The announcement will be made at the GDC games developer conference in San Francisco on 17th March, according to TechRadar. 'Rumours of Sony's PS4 virtual reality headset have been running rife since last year, but now an inside source has told TechRadar that they've spent some time with the helmet behind closed doors - and it's almost ready to be revealed' the site said. It said the headset has already been shown off behind closed doors. 'The quality and resolution are really, really good,' one person who has tried it told the site. 'People will definitely be impressed with what Sony's built.' The headset will plug into Sony's PS4 games console, allowing players to immerse themselves completely in games. The headset is likely to compete with the Oculus Rift, an eagerly awaiting VR headset shown off earlier this year at CES. Like Sony produce, it uses two small LCD screens in a headset to fool the brain into thinking it is seeing a 'real' world image. The headset has motion tracking and the display in the screen reacts accordingly as the player moves their head around. The Oculus Rift works by tracking the player’s head movements using sensor technology. It also uses a new technique called low-latency mitigation that lets the players explore the world as if it was a reality. Sony's PS4 VR headset is expected to look similar to its TV watching version, shown here . Low-latency mitigation minimises the delay between the eyes seeing an image and processing what it sees. This makes the images appear to be happening closer to real time. The Rift's display shows two unique images, one for each eye, that the player’s mind fuses into a single stereoscopic 3D view of the virtual world. 'The Matrix - that's always been the dream,' said one Oculus Rift executive of its headset, pictured. The firm recently raised $75m to make its product mainstream. 'Over the past 16 months, we’ve grown from a startup to a company whose technology is poised to change the way we play, work and communicate,' said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR. '40,000 developers and enthusiasts, as well as a number of great partners, have joined our cause and helped us bring the seemingly impossible to life. 'This additional infusion of capital, as well as the leadership and experience of Marc and Chris, will help us take the final steps toward our ultimate goal: making virtual reality something consumers everywhere can enjoy.' 'We believe Oculus will not only alter the gaming landscape but will redefine fundamental human experiences in areas like film, education, architecture, and design. 'Oculus is at the tip of the iceberg of its potential, and we’re incredibly excited to help them change the world,' said Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz.","Addon expected to be revealed in San Francisco next month .

"By . John Hall . A father and son who were filmed laughing as they encouraged their dogs to tear animals to shreds will be released from prison in just a few weeks after being given light sentences today. Ronald Guy, 63, and his son Lee, 42, both from Birkenhead in Merseyside, were branded 'absolutely inhumane' after filming themselves feeding live pigeons to ferrets, cutting off the heads of chickens with knives and setting a pack of dogs on a fox. But the the pair were today jailed for just 12 and 22 weeks respectively after admitting a total of seven animal cruelty offences at Wirral Magistrates' Court. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Cruel: Ronald Guy (right) and his son Lee (left) were branded 'absolutely inhumane' after filming themselves cutting off the heads of chickens with knives (pictured) Attack: The two men were heard laughing as they encouraged their three dogs to attack wild rats . Lee Guy was jailed for 22 weeks after he used a mobile phone to film himself feeding wild pigeons to ferrets and setting up a fight between three dogs and a fox. His father Ronald Guy, 63, was jailed for . 12 weeks after causing unnecessary suffering to animals through the . ‘inhumane’ slaughter of chickens. At an earlier hearing in February, . Lee Guy pleaded guilty to a number of charges, including the inhumane . slaughter of chickens, causing wild rats to be attacked by dogs and . taking feral pigeons to feed ferrets. He also pleaded guilty to causing an animal fight by placing a fox with three dogs. Ronald Guy had earlier pleaded guilty to one charge of the inappropriate slaughter of chickens. Trapped: Lee Guy is pictured holding a cage containing a wild rat he captured. Lee and his father Ronald would later set the rat loose in a courtyard and encourage their dogs to tear it to pieces . Hunt: The captured rats were released from their cages into a rundown courtyard, where Lee Guy and his father Ronald would then set their dogs on them . Sick: On a video released by the RSPCA, the three dogs can be seen chasing the terrified rat before pinning it in a corner and tearing it to pieces . Referring to Lee Guy’s role in the . acts, Chris Murphy, prosecuting, said: 'The charges involve the . slaughter of chickens, and the causing of wild rats to be attacked by . dogs. 'There are three offences relating to the rats and there’s also an offence relating to the feeding of wild pigeons to ferrets. 'And . an offence - perhaps the most serious - of causing the animal fight to . take place between a fox and three dogs. The dogs were set upon the fox . that was kept in a caged box, tearing it apart and killing it.' Several . of the offences - which took place between November 2011 and June 2013 - . took place in front of gathered crowds and were captured on video. Lee Guy could even be heard laughing on the footage. Pain: The dogs eventually get hold of the rat as it tries to escape down a drain. They then tear it apart . No escape: Elsewhere in the footage, the dogs are seen being encouraged to enter a small cage in which a fox is held. The dogs can then be seen viciously attacking the animal . John Ballam, defending, said both defendants were ‘very ashamed’ by their actions. He . added Ronald Guy had enjoyed success at dog shows with pets in the past . and that the prospect of being banned from owning animals would be a . 'considerable punishment' to him. But District Judge Michael Ableson ignored pleas to give the defendants suspended sentences. 'This was absolutely inhumane behaviour to treat animals in this way,' he said. 'Most people would not be able to comprehend how you could treat animals with such cruelty.' RSPCA officer Anthony Joynes described the case as the worst one of its kind he had ever dealt with and welcomed the sentences. Vicious: The fox is quickly torn to pieces by the dogs, as one of the two men is heard encouraging them to increase their aggression . Death: The fox eventually escapes from the cage, but the dogs follow it to a grassy area, where it is torn apart . 'These sort of offences are just barbaric. It is abhorrent cruelty that belongs in the history books,' he said. 'There has been a rise in this sort of behaviour across the North West and if people are going to take that decision to get involved in that sort of cruelty then they can expect to spend time in prison,' he added. 'Lee Guy is clearly obsessed with the interaction between predator and prey, even to the point that I could hear laughter in the background,' Mr Joynes went on to say. The defendants were also ordered to pay £300 each in court costs. Their four dogs, one of which has since given birth to six puppies, have also been seized.","Lee Guy, 42, and his father Ronald, 63, were filmed torturing animals .

"By . Associated Press . The next time the American military transport plane known as Whiskey 7 drops its paratroopers over Normandy, France, it will be for a commemoration instead of an invasion. Seventy years after taking part in D-Day, the plane now housed at the National Warplane Museum in western New York is being prepared to recreate its role in the mission, when it dropped troops behind enemy lines under German fire. At the invitation of the French government, the restored Douglas C-47 will fly in for 70th-anniversary festivities and again release paratroopers over the original jump zone at Sainte-Mere-Eglise. Going home: Whiskey 7, a warplane that took part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy, is set to return to France to participate in the 70-year anniversary celebration . Relic: Whiskey 7 is currently housed at the National Warplane Museum in western New York . 'There are very few of these planes still flying, and this plane was very significant on D-Day,' said Erin Vitale, chairwoman of the Return to Normandy Project. 'It dropped people that were some of the first into Sainte-Mere-Eglise and liberated that town.' Museum officials say the twin-prop Whiskey 7, so named because of its W-7 squadron marking, is one of several C-47s scheduled to be part of the D-Day anniversary, with jumpers made up of active and retired military personnel. But it is believed to be the only one flying from the United States. The plane will fly to France by way of Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland and Germany, each leg 5 ½ to 7 hours. Vitale compared it to trying to drive a 70-year-old car across the country without a breakdown. ""It's going to be a huge challenge."" Among the 21 men it carried in 1944 was 20-year-old Leslie Palmer Cruise Jr., who also will make the return trip to France, his fifth, and be reunited with the craft — once it's on the ground. He is flying commercially from his Horsham, Pennsylvania, home outside Philadelphia. Whiskey 7 dropped 21 men behind enemy lines during the D-Day invasion, helping to liberate the town of Saint-Mere- Eglise. Above, boats storm the Normany shore . U.S. Army Air Force crew members pose in front of a Douglas C-47 in September 1944 - the same type of warplane as Whiskey 7 . 'With me, it's almost, sometimes, like yesterday,' Cruise, now 89, said by phone, recalling his first combat mission. 'It really never leaves you.' Although the C-47 looks much the same today as it did on June 6, 1944, it looked very different when it arrived at the museum as a donation eight years ago. It had been converted to a corporate passenger plane. 'We had to take an executive interior out,' said the museum's president, W Austin Wadsworth. 'It had a dry bar, lounge seats, a table with a nice map of the Bahamas in there. It was beautiful.' The museum's restoration of the historic plane to its original condition has been a roughly $180,000 project so far. Most of the money went toward two rebuilt engines and the rest to parts, equipment and service. The museum is trying to raise a total of $250,000 for the restoration and return to Normandy. One upgrade it did allow was the installation of two GPS systems to keep the aircraft on course. 'The avionics in the airplane are modern. We're not going to go with what they had in 1943,' Wadsworth said. 'They would have had probably a radio beacon receiver and a lot of dead reckoning.' There is still no autopilot, said Wadsworth's daughter, Naomi, who will be among five pilots — one including her brother, Craig — taking turns at the controls on the way to Europe. That's fine with her, she said. In the cockpit: Naomi Wadsworth (pictured) will be one of five pilots taking the plane back to France . Getting ready for the journey: Wadsworth stands outside the plane at the museum. So far the museum has spent some $180,000 to restore the plane for its upcoming flight . Replaced: The museum has rebuilt the plane's two engines . 'It's history. It's real flying,' she said. 'With a lot of the computerized, mechanized things that you see in the airliners today, the airplane basically flies itself. ... This is not a situation where you can be asleep at the wheel. You really have to pay attention.' Said her father, also a pilot: 'You don't just grab something and push it. There's a kind of feel to everything you do in these old birds. It doesn't have a soul obviously, but you don't just tell it what to do. You ask it.' Cruise still remembers being squashed between other paratroopers seated on pan seats as the plane left England's Cottesmore Airdrome. He was weighed down with probably 100 pounds of gear, including an M-1 rifle that was carried in three pieces, 30-caliber rifle ammo, a first-aid pack, grenade, K-rations and his New Testament in his left pocket, over his heart. Whiskey 7 will again drop paratroopers over France. Above a similar ceremony held on the 66th anniversary of D-Day . A US paratrooper packs his parachute after jumping over Sainte-Mere-Eglise, Normandy, western France, on June 3, 2012, during the ceremonies of the the D-Day's 66th anniversary . ""We could hear the louder roar as each plane following the leader accelerated down the runway and lifted into the air,"" he wrote in an account of the mission. 'Our turn came and the quivering craft gathered momentum along the path right behind the plane in front.' The airplane's engines were so loud he had to shout even to talk with the paratrooper next to him, he said, and the scenery through its square windows looked like shadows in the dark. Over the English Channel, a colonel pointed downward. 'In the partial darkness below we could make out silhouetted shapes of ships and there must have been thousands of them all sizes and kinds,' Cruise wrote. 'If we had any doubts before about the certainty of the invasion, they were dispelled now.'","At the ceremony, warplane Whiskey 7 will again drop paratroopers near the town of Saint-Mere-Eglise ."
"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Confession: Award-winning TV chef Jean-Christophe Novelli has revealed he is losing the ability to hear after spending years in noisy kitchens . As an award-winning TV chef, he has been a regular fixture on our screens for more than a decade. But Jean-Christophe Novelli's culinary skills appear to have come at a price - his hearing. The 53-year-old has revealed that he is losing the ability to hear after spending years in noisy kitchens. He said the clanging of steel, whirring of machines and endless stream of shouted instructions had caused him to develop a degree of deafness. He is now dependent on a hearing aid after being diagnosed with age-related and noise-related severe hearing loss. Novelli, who has won four Michelin stars, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Chefs work in very noisy . environments. 'You don’t speak, you scream. The sense of . urgency means there is a lot of movement. It is horrendous – the . banging, the pots – even for someone who has clear hearing.' The French chef, who has been working in restaurant kitchens since arriving in Britain aged 22, said he first noticed problems with his hearing after struggling to grasp conversations and TV shows. He began having to crane his neck and intensely concentrate to hear - leading to neck stiffness and painful headaches. But despite the signs, he remained in denial - believing he was too young to suffer from deafness. Noisy environment: Novelli said the clanging of steel and whirring of machines had caused him to develop a degree of deafness.  He is now dependent on a hearing aid after being diagnosed with severe hearing loss . In action: Novelli, who has won four Michelin stars, is pictured cooking at Les Saveurs restaurant in Mayfair . He only sought help after his fiancée, . Michelle Kennedy, persuaded him to get tested - and was finally . diagnosed with severe hearing loss at Specsavers in Hitchen, . Hertfordshire. 'Why did I not seek help sooner? Because . I’m a prat,' said Novelli. 'I never admitted it. How long could I have been . better off if I had not been putting pride or vanity before everything?' Novelli opened Maison Novelli in Clerkenwell in 1996, before going on to open a string of other restaurants across the country. Hectic: Novelli said the Four Seasons restaurant (pictured) in Park Lane had the noisiest kitchens of all . Difficulty: The chef's hearing issues meant he struggled to hold a conversation with Margaret Thatcher (right) He said the Four Seasons in Park Lane, London - featuring 20 departments - had the noisiest kitchens of all. During his career, his hearing problems meant he struggled to hold conversations with colleagues, members of the public and even other celebrities, including the Princess Royal and Baroness Thatcher. But the chef said his new hearing aid had transformed his life - adding that he was 'delighted' it was so discreet as to be unnoticeable. He has now appealed to other over-50s suffering from hearing problems to seek help and get tested. He is also fronting Specsavers's 'Putting hearing loss on the menu' campaign, which aims to raise awareness of age-related hearing loss. At present, 8 per cent of people in their 40s suffer from hearing loss - rising to 19 per cent of people in their 50s, according to Action on Hearing Loss. Symptoms include difficulty in hearing people clearly, misunderstanding what others say, asking people to repeat themselves and listening to music or watching television with the volume turned up high.","Jean-Christophe Novelli, 53, has been diagnosed with severe hearing loss .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Prime Minister David Cameron has warned those who choose to cash in their pension early under Government reforms that they could end up paying more for their care later in life. It comes after George Osborne announced in the latest Budget that savers would be allowed to withdraw money from their pension pots as they wish when they retire. However, under Government reforms, those who have assets worth more than £118,000, including their own homes, will have to pay for their own social care. Prime Minister David Cameron said people 'have a choice' about whether they decide to withdraw a lump sum from their pension or take out an annuity . It has prompted fears that those who choose to withdraw a large amount of money from their pension pot will be pushed over the threshold and forced into spending their saved cash on their care bills. However, Mr Cameron said people ‘have a choice’ about whether they decide to withdraw a lump sum from their pension or take out an annuity. According to The Telegraph, he said: ‘I know there is a concern that if you take your money out of your pension pot and have it as your own money, it counts as your money when you are assessed for care needs. That is true, that is the case, but you have the choice.’ From April 2016, the Government will introduce a limit of £72,000 on the amount any one person has to pay for social care. The Prime Minister said the cap would help those who faced hefty bills for social care and nursing homes. He said: ‘I think there was a great unfairness that, if you were hit with dementia, sometimes at a relatively young age, you could be faced with hundreds of thousands of pounds in nursing homes, eating up every last penny of savings. ‘Putting a cap on the maximum amount is a fair and good step to take’, reported the Telegraph. Chancellor George Osborne holding aloft the Budget Box as he leaves Number 11 Downing Street ahead of delivering the Budget speech last week . Last week, Chancellor George Osborne announced big changes for pensioners in his Budget 2014. He unveiled the most radical reform of pensions for a century which will allow workers nearing retirement to transform their private pension pots into bank accounts. It will abolish the need for some pensioners to buy annuity, meaning individuals will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like. Mr Osborne also revealed new ‘pensioner bonds’, issued by National Savings and Investments, which will launch in January 2015 with an investment limit of £10,000 each. Setting out his pitch to voters ahead of the 2015 general election, he declared: ‘If you’re a maker, a doer or a saver: this Budget is for you. ‘We set out our plan and together with the British people, we held our nerve. We’re putting Britain right.’ The new bonds aimed at pensioners will be offered with market-beating interest rates, with over 65s potentially being offered a four-year bond paying interest of around four per cent. Restrictions on pension pots will be reduced from Thursday and individuals with savings of £30,000 or less will be able to withdraw the full amount if they wish – which is nearly double the current £18,000 limit – with marginal tax rates. Then from April 2015, pensioners will be able to withdraw the entirety of their pensions from the age of 55. It means an individual with a £100,000 pension could take the first £25,000 tax free and then withdraw the remaining £75,000 but pay tax on it.","People with assets worth more than £118,000 will have to pay for care .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A jury has criticised the Army for safety failings after a soldier on a training exercise using live ammunition was shot dead when a colleague’s jammed machine gun suddenly fired. James Wilkinson, 21, from Whitefield, Greater Manchester, a fusilier with 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was hit in the neck in Kenya in 2011 after a senior officer failed to follow policy. Two soldiers, Fusilier Colin Bell and Pte Patrick Price, were convicted of negligence and later jailed. Both men were also dismissed from service but were allowed to remain in the forces on demoted ranks - Bell was a corporal and Price a staff sergeant - after Appeal Court judges reduced their sentences. Fusilier James Wilkinson and wife Sarah. He was killed during a training session in Kenya when he was shot in the neck . An inquest jury has delivered a narrative verdict  - where the details of death are recorded but no one is name as responsible for the death - after four days of evidence. The gun, which was being used by Fusilier Aaron Davenport, jammed during firing. Acting contrary to army safety procedures, it was taken behind the frontline to Fusilier Bell, but fired as he removed the barrel to clear the blockage, the inquest heard. Fusilier James Wilkinson marries Sarah. In front is her son, Connor. The couple were married for just four months and he never got to see his daughter, Annabel . Pte Price was acting in a safety support role. Giving evidence, Fusilier Bell admitted the weapon should have remained with Fusilier Davenport and said that he should have treated it as dangerous because it would not cock. He also said an armourer should have been called. Simon Nelson, the coroner, ruled that the jury could not name individuals or use words which could imply judgment in a civil or criminal context in its decision. They ruled the order to take the gun behind the row of soldiers was ‘inappropriate and ill-judged’. The jury also criticised ‘insufficient training’ and hit out at ‘ambiguous language’ during training, adding: ‘The major safety factor omitted was thought to be the safe direction of the weapon while attempting to clear the stoppage.’ Newlywed Fusilier Wilkinson, who leaves a widow Sarah, daughter Annabel and stepson Connor, was hit as he was lying on the ground. His father Robert, 47, described the verdict as ‘irrelevant’ and said the family were ‘absolutely disgusted’ with the Appeal Court ruling. He said: ‘Ultimately James was failed by his colleagues and as a result of their actions or lack of, we are serving a life sentence. We cannot accept what has happened due to these men failing to carry out procedures they are taught on a regular basis. Training does not override safety.’ Mr Wilkinson also hit out at the Army because Fusilier Wilkinson’s mobile phone was not returned after his death. Stepfather: Fusilier James Wilkinson with Connor, the son of his wife Sarah . He added: ‘Never a day goes by without us thinking of James.’ Fusilier Wilkinson’s widow Sarah spoke of her anger over his death – and said the family hasn’t received an apology. They were married for just four months and he never got to see his daughter Annabel. Mrs Wilkinson, 23, is pursuing a civil claim for damages against the Ministry of Defence. She said: ‘It has been devastating to find out exactly how utterly preventable the incident was and though I am glad to hear there have been amendments made to safety drills in light of what happened, I am still absolutely disgusted that there has been no justice throughout this process. Fusilier James Wilkinson was killed while on a live ammunition training exercise in Kenya . ‘I just wish the men responsible were no longer able to serve in the forces so an example could be made of them and lessons learned. It is obvious to all that serious mistakes were made. ‘I will never get over losing James. He was my whole world and I miss him immensely.’ Solicitor Deirdre Healy from the law firm Pannone, now part of Slater & Gordon, confirmed she is pursuing legal action against the MOD on behalf of Mrs Wilkinson. The Ministry of Defence has admitted liability for the incident and will not contest any personal injury claim from the family. A spokesman added: 'Our thoughts remain with Fusilier Wilkinson’s friends and family following this tragic accident. As recognised at the inquest, we have accepted and implemented all the necessary recommendations that came out of the investigation into the accident so that we can try to prevent something like this from ever happening again.'","James Wilkinson from Gtr Manchester killed on exercise in Kenya in 2011 .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Help find him: Police are urging the public to help them trace a 13-year-old boy who has gone missing from his Birmingham home . Fears are growing for a 13-year-old boy who went missing on Saturday after being told he couldn't go to a library. Munasar Jiniqow disappeared on Saturday night when he sneaked out of his home in Edgbaston, Birmingham. The schoolboy failed to return home and his worried family have not seen or heard from him since. Birmingham South police said the teenager disappeared after being told he wasn't allowed to attend an educational event taking place at the Library of Birmingham.

A ‘callous and wicked’ student was sentenced to 12 years in jail yesterday for throwing acid in her childhood friend’s face. Mary Konye, 22, wore an Islamic veil that hid her face to stalk and attack Naomi Oni on her way home from work in the early hours. Sentencing her, Judge David  Radford said the ‘deliberate and wicked act’ was ‘devastating’. Scroll Down for Video .

Solicitor Mitesh Patel today reads a statement on behalf of the victim outside the court alongside Marriam Oni, Naomi's mother . Marriam Oni covers her eyes following the sentence of Konye who threw acid in her daughter's face . He said it was a ‘premeditated, evil and callous’ copy of the acid attack on presenter Katie Piper. In . a statement, Miss Oni, 22, said: ‘My attacker’s sentence will end but I . have to live with my injuries and disabilities for the rest of my life. 'The world only sees my scars that have been left, but I have mental . scars that will stay with me forever.’ Yesterday . Konye, of Canning Town, East London, finally admitted throwing the acid . after maintaining throughout the trial that Miss Oni attacked herself. She continues to claim that Miss Oni asked her to do it so she could enjoy ‘fame and fortune’ like Miss Piper. CCTV footage: Konye followed Ms Oni at Barking Station before unleashing the attack last December . Before the attack: In a statement read to the court, Ms Oni described how she sometimes felt suicidal after the horrifying incident . Judge . Radford told Konye: ‘The consequences of your deliberate and wicked act . have been devastating for Miss Oni, causing her terrible pain and . physical injury. The result of your offence, as  you must have foreseen, . was life-changing injuries. ‘This was wholly premeditated criminality against a person who reasonably believed that you were her true friend.’ He . said she had not shown any genuine remorse and had ‘ruined [Miss Oni’s] . trust in anyone who she believed to be a friend, that friendship being . so wilfully betrayed by you’. He . added that the attack might have been driven by jealousy and that Konye . displayed signs of a ‘stalking behavioural disorder’. Konye, . who hung her head and wept quietly as he spoke, will be expected to . serve at least two-thirds of her 12-year term, but could be freed after . eight years. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard she was ‘obsessed’ with Miss . Oni, from Dagenham, East London, and envied her looks. Miss . Oni described how, going home from her job at lingerie shop Victoria’s . Secret, she got  off at her bus stop and felt a ‘presence’ before . turning to see someone in a niqab, or veil. She . felt a ‘massive splash’ as the acid was thrown at her, disfiguring her . face, dissolving her hair and eyelashes and burning her tongue as she . screamed. Describing how she felt, she said: ‘Why has this happened to . me? I work hard. Am I ugly? No one’s going to marry me now.’ Miss Oni also recalled telling Konye about the attack. Konye replied: ‘OMG. Can’t believe it.’ Scars: The injuries inflicted on by Ms Oni she says have 'turned her life upside down' Devastated: Miss Oni said she 'broke down' after removing her bandages following surgery . Miss Oni added: ‘I just had my bandages removed and it was the first time I saw my face after surgery and I broke down. ‘I . was crying on the phone to her and she was on the phone to me telling . me don’t worry.’ The court heard the pair fell out when Miss Oni said . Konye looked like a disfigured character from the horror film Wrong . Turn. After the attack, . Konye posted pictures of another horror film character, Freddy Krueger, . on a social networking site with the caption: ‘Who looks like Wrong Turn . now?’ In a victim impact . statement, Miss Oni said her life had been ‘completely turned upside . down’. Each day was a ‘challenge and a battle’, she said, adding: ‘It . is  difficult to live with my physical appearance. 'Iam very conscious . of it and am reminded of what  I look like every day when I see my . reflection or the reaction on people’s faces.’ She . said she had trouble eating and sleeping, adding: ‘I lie awake at night . for hours on end, reliving the incident in my head.’ Mitigating, Sally O’Neill QC said Konye had a ‘difficult domestic upbringing’ and felt remorse.

"By . Martin Robinson . A suspected drink driver has been publicly shamed by police who published a picture of his car after he drove off the road and plunged into a canal. Giles Bond, 24, was rescued after he managed to climb out onto the roof as his vehicle started to sink into the murky water. Afterwards the motorist suffered further embarrassment when officers in Cheshire tweeted a picture with the title: 'Drink driver finds himself in the drink', and added that his car 'wasn't a Morris Marina'. Shamed: An alleged drink driver had to be rescued after plunging into this canal in an incident publicised by police on Twitter . The post led to responses like: 'It looks like he is in deep water' and was he driving a 'Renault Lagoon-a?' Police and two fire crews were called to the scene at Sanbach Canal in Hall Lane, Ettiley Heath, in Cheshire on Sunday. Firefighters used a canal boat to reach Bond, from Hassall, Cheshire, before taking him back to the canal tow path. Officers then arrested him and he has since been charged with drink driving. Poking fun: Officers in Cheshire tweeted this picture of Giles Bond's car and joked he wasn't driving a Morris Marina . A Cheshire Fire and Rescue spokesperson said: 'We have water vessels in Warrington and Chester because that is where they are primarily used. 'But on this occasion firefighters took the decision to commandeer a canal boat to cross the water and rescue the man, as time was a factor.' Bond is due to appear at Macclesfield Magistrates Court, in Cheshire, on April 10.

James Brady, 32, was pictured installing a steel beam with president Obama’s signature on the One WTC’s 104th floor in January last year. Today, Mr Brady was accused of smuggling in the gear the group used to carry out the death-defying stunt in the early hours of September 30 last year. Scroll down for video . Inside job: James Brady, left, pictured with fellow arrested jumper Andrew Rossig, right, worked in construction at One World Trade Center last year and is now accused of smuggling in gear to accomplish the jump . Captured: Police allegedly seized the GoPro video of the BASE jump during a search of the four men's home last month, and it was not posted online until yesterday . Spreading fast: The five-minute video was uploaded to YouTube on Monday and has had more than 185,000 views in less than 24 hours . ‘This is an inside person who . apparently went rogue for his own self-glorification,’ a law enforcement . source told the New York Post. The . ironworker and his three companions were arrested yesterday after . handing themselves in following a police investigation into their stunt . in September last year. Mr . Brady and two friends, Andrew Rossig and Marko Markovich, BASE-jumped . off the One World Trade Center’s Freedom Tower while another man, named . as Kyle Hartwell, allegedly served as a lookout. Mr Rossig said the jumpers got in simply by walking through a gap in a fence, however a law enforcement source disputed that account. He said Mr Brady used his work access to secret his parachuting pals into the site, a statement Mr Brady's attorney denied. Giving in: Former World Trade Center construction worker Mr Brady, left, and Mr Rossig are accompanied by their attorneys as they surrender to police in New York yesterday . On site: James Brady is pictured left as he and a colleague connect a steel beam signed by President Obama on the 104th floor of One World Trade Center in January last year . The jump was filmed with a GoPro camera and was posted on YouTube yesterday as the men handed themselves over to the NYPD. The . video, which shows the three jumping off the Freedom Tower and landing . in front of the nearby Goldman Sachs building, has had more than 185,000 . views in less than 24 hours. The . NYPD said last fall that investigators were looking for two . parachutists in dark jumpsuits seen floating near the building around . 3am on September 30, but did not signal that arrests were imminent until . a New Jersey teenager was arrested for trespassing at the WTC last . week.

Mr Markovich, 27, from Lake Ronkonkoma, New York and Mr Hartwell, 29, . from East Patchogue, New York, handed themselves in yesterday. They . face charges of burglary and trespassing as well as misdemeanor . reckless endangerment and misdemeanor jumping from a structure. Mr Rossig said the jump was ‘very exhilarating,’ as he and co-defendant Mr Brady headed to a police precinct . to surrender on Monday. ‘It's a fair . amount of free-fall time,’ he said. ‘You really get to enjoy the view of . the city and see it from a different perspective.’ Mr Rossig, . an avid BASE jumper said the skydivers took care to keep from endangering anyone, . choosing a time when streets would be largely deserted. NYPD . searched the four men’s homes last month and seized the GoPro video of . the jump, Mr Rossig's attorney Timothy Parlatore said. However authorities did not signal that arrests were imminent until 16-year-old Justin . Casquejo's arrest last week, which is when they surrendered.

Good cause: All proceeds made from the video will be donated to charity, the group has said . The city that never sleeps: One of the jumpers descend on the streets of New York City . ‘He has an . impeccable background, and I just hope that he's not turned into some . form of a scapegoat for the Port Authority's shortcomings’ in security', Mr . Corozzo said. Police Commissioner William Bratton said the investigation was a joint endeavor by the NYPD and the Port Authority police. ‘These . men violated the law and placed themselves, as well as others, in . danger,’ PC Bratton said. ‘These arrests should send a message to anyone . thinking about misusing a landmark this way. They will be tracked down . and they will face serious charges. Being a thrill-seeker does not give . immunity from the law.’ The . NYPD devotes more than 200 officers, surveillance cameras and other . technology to protect the perimeter of the site, while Port Authority . police and private security agents guard the inside.

The trio have been identified as Marco Markovich, Andrew Rossig and James Brady - and their look-out was allegedly Kyle Hartwell. Police believe the thrill-seekers climbed through the same hole in a fence to get to the top of the famous New York skyscrapper that a New Jersey teen, Justin Casquej, did last week. Scroll down for video . Jump: Three BASE jumpers, including Marco Markovick, pictured possibly during the daring jump, are accused of leaping off One World Trade Center last September . Thrill-seekers: The trio have been identified as Marco Markovich, pictured, Andrew Rossig and James Brady - and their look-out was allegedly Kyle Hartwell . Rossig's defence lawyer, Tim Parlatore, told the New York Post: 'They are accused of sneaking into the World Trade Center, going through quite possibly the same hole in the fence that this kid climbed through last week that they never fixed, going to the top and parachuting off.' The three, and Hartwell, are expected to surrender Thursday and face burglary and trespassing charges, The Post reported. Casquej rode an elevator up to the top of the building on March 16. 'They walked up - they didn't get a ride up like that kid,' Parlatore told The Post of the BASE jumpers. Parlatore said authorities had viedo evidence from a helmet camera that one of the jumpers was wearing when they launched off the terror target September 30. The three men, clad in black, allegedly jumped from the tower about 3 a.m. They were captured on surveillance video falling from the sky in front of investment bank Goldman Sachs building before scurrying away into the night. The footage sparked terrorism concerns as police weren't sure at first whether the men had jumped from a building or plane. Daredevil: Justin Casquejo, 16, sneaked into the WTC site and spent almost two hours on the roof of the nearly completed Freedom Tower, he is pictured at right on top of a construction crane in nearby Hoboken . Fascinated: Casquejo has long been obsessed with the WTC's Freedom Tower, according to the Post . The extreme sportsmen were pinned to . the crime when they saved GoPro video footage of the jump, which was . discovered during a search of their homes. It's unclear how . investigators identified the men. The Manhattan district attorney's office plans to charge the four with burglary, the New York Daily News reported and possibly other charges. According to The Post, Rossig, of . Orange County, has been busted twice in the past for BASE jumping, once . in Bear Mountain State Park in upstate New York and again for trying to . jump off a 33-story building in the Bronx. Brady was with him at the Bronx. The . news came as more details were revealed about how the 16-year-old . daredevil managed to bypass security and reach the dizzying heights of . the renowned tower. The . Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's surveillance system, worth . $4,000, was still packed in its box when Casquej climbed the building. Although the Port Authority bought the system in August, officials didn't want to pay to install it, the New York Post reported today. A . source told the paper that the official who oversaw the purchase was so . incensed at what he saw as a very high price for a two-camera system . that he decided not to spend any more money to have it up and running. Thrillseeker: Casquejo, pictured on a construction crane in Hoboken, appears to love sneaking into tall buildings under construction . 'He looked at me and my colleague and . said, 'Why did I spend $4,000 on this equipment when you could have gone . to Home Depot and gotten something cheaper?’’' the source, who is an . electrician that worked on the project for a vendor, said. 'I . was kind of stunned, because that’s a pretty bold statement to make . considering we got the specs from them, and the Port Authority had it . made to order.' The system . ordered is known as a '“Two-Camera DVR Solution System.” It was supposed . to be installed quickly after the August purchase, the source added, to . protect the spire that was hoisted in place in May. The spire also . contains a critically important antenna. A . Port Authority spokesman said that the system wasn't installed because . infrastructure to support the system had not yet reached the top of the . 104-floor building, which is still under construction. In the early morning hours of March 16, Casquejo, 16, accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by . slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4 a.m., . He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing . scaffolding. Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper. Accused: Casquejo faces a criminal trespass charge for his WTC stunt, but appears to have gotten away with climbing a construction crane in Hoboken (right) Boisterous: Casquejo was much more talkative on Twitter than when reached by the Post . He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof. Casquejo scaled equipment on the roof to reach the 1,776-foot tall Freedom Tower's antenna. The daredevil spent two hours perched atop the city before trying to sneak his way out as the sun came up.

"By . Emma Glanfield . The mother of a 19-year-old model who died of cervical cancer after doctors failed to allow her a smear test has questioned why her daughter was refused the simple examination. The NHS scrapped routine smears for under-25s in 2003 over concerns they could do more harm than good. But Sophie Jones' mother, Peri Cawley, 47, has launched a campaign – called Sophie’s Choice – to get the minimum age for automatic smear tests cut to 16. Sophie Jones, pictured,  died from cervical cancer at the age of 19 after being refused a smear test by doctors on the grounds she was too young . Sophie's family released this image of the 19-year-old in hospital, taken shortly before her death from cervical cancer on March 15 . Sophie Jones, of Eastham, . Merseyside, had suffered crippling stomach pains for over a year before . she was initially diagnosed with Crohn's disease, it was claimed . Speaking to The Sun, Mrs Cawley, of Eastham, Wirral, said: ‘It took her nearly a year and ten GP appointments to get diagnosed, which just isn’t good enough. ‘Who knows what could have been had she been given a smear test. Girls are getting boob jobs on the NHS to make themselves feel better. What’s the cost of a smear test compared to that?’ Aspiring model Sophie, who had just walked in her first catwalk show, was told she was too young to have a smear test when she complained of crippling stomach pains last February. She was only diagnosed correctly with cervical cancer in November, by which time the disease had spread all over her body. She died on March 15. Miss Jones was described by her sister, Stephanie, as 'a very calming influence on everyone around her' Mrs Cawley was at her daughter's bedside when she passed away but said it was too difficult to watch as her daughter took her last breath. She said: ‘I held her hand. I could never say goodbye to Sophie because she will always be with me. ‘If we can do something to make sure this doesn’t happen to someone else, then Sophie’s death won’t have been in vain.’ The petition launched by Sophie’s family, including her mother Peri, father Jason, 41, twin sister Ashleigh, 19, sisters Chelsea 24, Stephanie, 28, and Natasha, 23, and brothers Kris, 26, and Andy, 26, has now received more than 300,000 signatures. Mrs Cawley said they put the word ‘choice’ in the name of the campaign on purpose. She . said: ‘The word “choice” in the campaign means that people should have . just that – a choice. If a girl presents at a doctor’s with symptoms she . should be given the pros and cons of being tested.’ Last Facebook picture: Miss Jones posted this photo two weeks before her death on March 15 . Killer disease: Miss Jones, from Eastham, was admitted to hospital in November after her condition worsened . Labour health spokesman Luciana Berger said: ‘Women can have a cervical smear test at any age if their doctor thinks it’s necessary to help in diagnosis, so we must understand what went wrong in this case to ensure such a tragedy does not happen again.’ The programme was introduced for girls in school in 2008 with the aim of eventually cutting the incidence of cervical cancer by up to 70 per cent. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘This is a tragic case. The issue was last debated in Parliament in 2009, but the best independent evidence still shows that routine screening of women under 25 does more harm than good. ‘Cervical cancer in women under 25s is extremely rare. In 2011, there were 47 cases of cervical cancer in women under 25 and no deaths.’ Miss Jones, pictured with her boyfriend Jake Molyneux, was 'in high spirits' the day she died, her sister said . Miss Jones' family and friends are now calling for younger women to be offered cervical cancer screening . Screening: The test is currently offered to women aged 25 or over . The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis.  Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young.  According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011. The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good. The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety. Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland.  In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year.  In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active. Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later. Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31.","Sophie Jones, 19, of Merseyside, died of cervical cancer on March 15 .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Jason Wilson, 35, has been jailed for 18 months at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to attacking 21-year-old Ashley Madden on a bus . A 'barbaric' thug who admitted attacking a bus passenger because he complained about children throwing sweets at him has been jailed. Jason Wilson, 35, was on the number 24 bus in Birmingham City Centre with his partner, Laura Breckneall, 34, her 10-year-old son and her daughter, when 21-year old Ashley Madden asked the children to stop throwing sweets at him. The court heard that Wilson then walked to the back of the bus, sat next to Mr Madden and spat in his face. In full view of the children, Wilson punched and kicked Mr Madden, jumping up on the seats to get a better angle. Ms Breckneall passed Wilson a bottle of Jif lemon juice which he squirted in Mr Madden's eyes. She was initially arrested but all charges against her were dropped at a later hearing. 'Shocking' CCTV footage of the seven minute attack, which included kicks, knees and punches, was shown to Birmingham Crown Court today. Mr Madden had to be taken to hospital after the attack and was left with a bruised nose, swelling and bruising to his left eye, and breathing difficulties. Jailing Wilson for 18 months Recorder Martine Kushner said: 'What I saw on the screen was truly, truly shocking. 'A child needs boundaries, he doesn't need to see an assault being carried out by the person who looks after him. You could have just moved away. 'The next thing you could have done was go over to the child and explain to him not to do that, but that is not what you did. 'There is some degree of thought to incapacitate the victim and you go back again and again four times. Scroll down for video . Wilson attacked Mr Madden on the number 24 bus in January, punching and kicking him before squirting lemon juice into his eyes . The attack took place after Mr Madden asked the children Wilson was looking after to stop throwing sweets . The court heard that Wilson walked over to Mr Madden and spat in his face before hitting him . 'You use the handles of the seat to get the maximum force. There may have not been much harm but you had absolutely no care what the effect was going to be. 'This was a violent attack in a pubic place, in the middle of a bus, in the middle of an afternoon. 'All I can do is give you a custodial sentence. Anybody who sees the CCTV would think it is significantly serious.' Officers from West Midlands Police released the minute-long video taken by CCTV cameras in February - which led to a flood of people naming Wilson as the attacker. He then eventually handed himself into a police station on February 20. The attack was watched by Mr Wilson's girlfriend, Laura Breckneall, 34, and her two children - a son, aged 10, who suffers from ADHD and Asperger's and a daughter . After the attack Mr Madden was taken to hospital with bruising to his nose and eye and breathing difficulties . During the attack Ms Breckneall even passed Wilson a bottle of lemon juice which he squired in Mr Madden's eyes . Pleased: Mr Madden smiled as he left Birmingham Crown Court following the verdict today . Prosecutor Claire Harris told the court: 'Just after 4.30pm the complainant Ashley Madden had got on the number 24 bus by the new library in the city centre and sat on the top deck intending to travel to Quinton. 'The defendant also got on with his partner and her two children. One of the children who was 10-years-old was throwing sweets over his shoulder. 'Ashley Madden asked this defendant, who he assumed was with the boy, to stop throwing the sweets. 'The defendant then made his way over to him and spat in his face. 'Ashley Madden's reaction was to punch him, but it was then that an extreme amount of violence was used on this complainant who was essentially trapped in the corner. 'He is a big man and his punched, he kicked. The assault was prolonged and sustained. Wilson admitted assault occasioning ABH at an earlier hearing at Birmingham Crown Court . Police initially released CCTV in February when Wilson and Laura Breckneall were quickly identified. Ms Breckneall was originally arrested and charged, but the charges were dropped at an earlier hearing . 'The defendant went off and came back for more. On one occasion he lifts himself up off the floor and kicks the defendant in the face and then he squirted lemon juice in his face. 'It was used in order to blind the complainant and to degrade him. There was also an attempt to take his mobile phone in an attempt to prevent him from calling the police.' In Wilson's defence, Michael Garrett said: 'He completely lost his self control, he admitted that in interview. The red mist came down and he lost it. 'He makes no excuse for his conduct at all. It is an aggravating feature.'","Jason Wilson, 35, and Laura Breckneall, 34, were on bus in Birmingham .

"By . Lucy Crossley . It is a scheme that even King Joffrey might find too cruel but one maths teacher has come up with a way of controlling unruly pupils - by threatening to reveal which characters die on Game Of Thrones. Fans of the hit HBO series have spent months trying to avoid any spoilers ahead of the fourth series, including the class of children at a Belgian school. But when the youngsters became too rowdy their maths teacher hit upon a dastardly plan which could rival any dreamed up by Tyrion Lannister. Scroll down for video . Plot: A maths teacher came up with a way of controlling unruly pupils - by threatening to reveal Game Of Thrones spoilers unless they were quiet . Cunning:  The maths teacher's dastardly plan could rival any dreamed up by Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage (pictured) Plot: The teacher asked his class students which of them watched the series, based on the A Song Of Ice And Fire novels by author George M. Martin . According to Belgian newspaper Nieuwsblad, the teacher asked his class of 70 students which of them watched the epic fantasy series, based on the A Song Of Ice And Fire novels by author George M. Martin. When around three-quarters of the pupils raised their hands, the teacher, who has not been identified, replied: 'Well I've read all the books. If there's too much noise I will write the names of the dead on the board. 'They are enough to fill the whole year and I can even describe how they die.'

Series: Taking inspiration from ancient myths as well as historic events, the show centres on the struggle for power between a number of families in the mainland of Westeros . Some giggling pupils reportedly then decided to put their teacher's threat to the test, only for him to begin writing out the names of every character killed at the end of the third series on his board 'for those who had not seen it'. According to a post believed to have been written by a pupil on French website Dans Ton Chat: 'There was a religious silence for the last hour of the lesson'. The pupil described his teacher as a 'genius'. The series, starring Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke, returns in the US on April 6, and will air in the UK on Sky Atlantic the following day.

"By . John Stevens . Perched perilously on a lorry axle, two migrants make a desperate attempt to get into Britain. The pair were filmed by hidden night-vision cameras as they clung to the underside of the Dover-bound lorry in Calais. French Channel ports are seeing a surge in asylum seekers trying to make it to the UK, with hundreds of Syrian refugees among those living in squalid camps awaiting their chance. Dicing with death: A night vision camera catches two men attempting to sit on the axle of a lorry to get into the UK . BBC cameras captured the moment the two migrants clambered on to a British lorry under cover of darkness. Migrants often wait for a truck to stop at a junction before climbing underneath. Gangs can be seen on the road leading to the port as lorries approach. This truck was stopped for the migrants’ safety once they were picked up on camera, and French police were called. Its driver Clive Mills said: ‘I would never have known they were on there. I didn’t see them get on. I was looking in the mirror, looking down the road to pull out – it’s just frightening. Something somewhere has to change because you can kill people.’ The men were asked if they realised the danger they were exposing themselves to, and one replied: ‘Yes, but I have to go there. This country is not good to live in, we have to go to England.’ French charity workers say four migrants died in one week earlier this month as they attempted to get to Dover. Calais, which became a magnet for UK-bound refugees in the mid-90s following the war in Kosovo, is again attracting hundreds of migrants who want to cross the Channel. Many are Syrians, some of the estimated 2.1million who have fled fighting in the country. Britain is the preferred destination for many because of its global language and generous benefits. Strife in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Eritrea has seen a rise in migrants attempting to enter the UK illegally . Risky: The men risked life and limb by clutching the lorry's axle . Immigration Minister James Brokenshire . said yesterday: ‘There have been indications of an increase in the . number of people trying to get to the UK through the Channel ports. That . in part is because of ongoing conflict in the Middle East and North . Africa.’ The resurgence of the Calais problem follows closure of the huge Sangatte refugee camp in 2002 and the removal of a massive squat near the ferry terminal in 2009. The deputy mayor of Calais warned last year that Britain was a target for Syrian refugees, with gangs charging migrants more than £10,000 each to smuggle them to the UK. Cameras installed by the BBC have captured men running towards trucks and climbing beneath the vehicles, with drivers oblivious to their actions .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He is the latest new resident of Albert Square having signed up to play ill-tempered retired fishmonger Stan Carter. But Timothy West said yesterday he realises he is in the minority when it comes to TV soaps and older people. The 79-year-old star, who is married to actress Prunella Scales, enjoyed a guest stint as businessman Eric Babbage in Coronation Street last year and has now joined BBC1 soap EastEnders. Timothy West, 79, now plays grandfather Stan Carter in EastEnders. He said that soap operas undervalued older people . Asked whether there are enough older . people in soaps, he told Radio Times: 'I find they’re not valued so much . and I suspect that’s one of the reasons why I’ve been brought in (to . EastEnders). 'From what I hear, there hasn’t been enough interest in older characters. Or enough older characters to be interested in.' The veteran actor said that he . signed up to play Stan Carter 'because it’s a good part' and will see . him perform alongside Albert Square veteran and co-star June Brown who . plays long-suffering Dot. West said he had 'enormous respect' for Miss . Brown. EastEnders, . whose new faces include hardman actor Danny Dyer, 36, as Queen Vic . landlord and Stan’s son Mick Carter, has been undergoing a revamp as . part of an attempt to reinvigorate the drama following a ratings slump. Annette Badland, 63, who plays busybody Babe Smith, was also brought into the soap to help reinvigorate its older generation. Timothy West was brought onto EastEnders to reinvigorate its older audience. Actress Annette Badland, 63, who plays Babe Smith, also recently joined the soap . West . said of today’s television: 'I do miss things like the single play. It . was the event of the week. Now you have more channels, you don’t get . that conversation at the bus stop about what you saw last night.' Asked whether he had any guilty TV . pleasures, he joked: 'Things I’m a little bit ashamed of? Well, I don’t . watch any porn! To be honest, I don’t think I watch enough television to . feel guilty about it.' The . actor and his wife, actress Prunella Scales, recently embarked on four . canal journeys across Britain for a More4 documentary. In the series, West told how former Fawlty Towers star Scales has been suffering from 'a sort of mild Alzheimer’s'. In 2012 a BBC report revealed TV viewers feel that the elderly get less air-time than other age groups, and older women in particular are ‘invisible’, a BBC report reveals. The research showed viewers felt there was a perceived habit of treating the elderly as ‘peripheral’ or ‘token figures’ in drama, comedy and entertainment shows. They said the elderly were treated as ‘props’ for other stories, and regularly portrayed in a ‘humorous’, ‘mocking’ or ‘insulting’ manner. Pensioners were often said to be portrayed as stubborn with a ‘tendency to moan about things’ or in some cases as an ‘adorable idiot’. Timothy West, pictured here with his wife Prunella Scales, will join EastEnders at the age of 78.

This tendency for New Yorkers to come together also held true during the city-wide search for my younger brother, Avonte Oquendo. Let this be a reminder that at the end of the day, as tough as New Yorkers are, we can come together as one to achieve common goals that are in the best interest of our children, our loved ones, and our city...

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . If you’re short of money, this might be the cashpoint for you – for it  is barely a couple of feet off  the ground. The ATM has been installed outside a Sainsbury’s Local in Nottingham and, since it is the only one available outside the store, customers have been left with little choice but to use it.

It looked incredibly uncomfortable.’ Molly Kate Hancock commented on his post: 'This makes no sense!'

When asked to clarify, a spokesman refused to explain further, saying merely: 'Our statement says it all'. A spokesman for the nearby World of Mobility wheelchair and scooter shop said the ATM was far too low to have been installed with wheelchair users in mind. No-one seems quite sure why the ATM is built so close to the ground, not even Sainsbury's themselves . People wanting to use the cashpoint have to bend double or squat to reach the buttons on the ATM .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A doctor who is accused of taking advantage of 'desperate' cancer patients will have to justify his actions before a 'fitness to practise' panel. Doctor Julian Kenyon is facing a fitness to practise hearing after allegedly misleading cancer patients on the effectiveness of a treatment . Dr Julian Kenyon claimed his Sono Photo Dynamic Therapy (SPDT), which uses sonar and light, could kill tumour cells in 80 per of late-stage cancer patients, a tribunal heard today. For the a 20-minute treatment session, Dr Kenyon charged a rate of £300. The unconventional method is generally a last resort when other treatments fail, a representative of the GMC told the tribunal today. Dr Kenyon also told a patient that the treatment was more effective than traditional chemotherapy, it is alleged. The complementary medicine practitioner offered the ‘novel approach’ to one patient during a 20 minute consultation, at the Dove Clinic’s Wimpole Street consulting rooms, in Marylebone, central London. He also told an undercover reporter from The Sunday Times that the rate of ‘complete responses’, or long-term survivors, following the treatment, was just under 10 per cent. The journalist posed as a cancer patient’s husband in December 2012. Dr Kenyon, who trained in general medicine, is facing a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester. The hearing began today and has been listed for 10 days. Dr Kenyon admits making the assertions, but denies any of his conduct was dishonest or misleading. The General Medical Council (GMC) alleges that Dr Kenyon overstated the effectiveness of the treatment - without enough evidence to support his claims. Ben Fitzgerald, for the GMC, said: ‘Dr Julian Kenyon faces an allegation that his fitness to practise is impaired by reason of his misconduct. ‘The misconduct in question concerns Dr Kenyon’s misleading statements made in late 2012 to two individuals, one a genuine patient with advanced cancer and the other an undercover reporter posing as the husband of a woman with advanced cancer, about the effectiveness of a private medical treatment he was offering to provide.’During treatment, a patient is given a ‘sensitiser’ then exposed to a light bed and a hand-held ultrasound device, the hearing was told. This is said to activate the sensitiser within the tumour site and kill cancer cells as well as provoking an immune response within the patient, the panel heard. SPDT is a development of a conventionally accepted treatment, Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), which uses light alone to activate the sensitiser for tumours lying on or close to the skin. SPDT is said to have the ability to penetrate deeper into the body than some treatments. Mr Fitzgerald said: ‘The GMC’s case is that SPDT is indeed a novel form of treatment and one in respect of which the evidence of effectiveness is, and was in 2012, extremely limited. ‘It is also the kind of unconventional private treatment that patients with advanced and serious forms of cancer may turn to, in a state of some desperation, after the failure of conventional forms of treatment to address their condition. ‘In this context it is essential that any doctor offering the treatment should provide accurate and non-misleading information about the evidence of its effectiveness. ‘The GMC alleges that Dr Kenyon’s statements about SPDT were misleading, because they had the effect of overstating the evidence of its effectiveness without drawing attention sufficiently to the limitations of the evidence.’ Mr Fitzgerald told the panel that while Dr Kenyon appears to be a genuine enthusiast of the new treatment which may prove to be effective, his knowledge of the evidence available at the time meant that the picture he painted of the service was not justified. ‘Accordingly, it is alleged that Dr Kenyon’s conduct was dishonest as well as simply misleading,’ he added. The Dove Clinic on Wimpole Street where Dr Kenyon is alleged to have 'misled' patients over the effectiveness of a novel cancer treatment . A man in the late stages of cancer, known only as Patient A, consulted Dr Kenyon in September 2013 after researching alternative therapies. The patient has since died from the illness, but was recommended SPDT by Dr Kenyon to treat the disease. The medic is alleged to have said ‘there is a strong possibility that we would be able to increase your median survival time’. Dr Kenyon did make it clear that it was not a cure, but an experimental treatment which needed further trials, but did say there was a ‘strong possibility’ of extending the patient’s life. ‘Patient A was a man with advanced cancer who was seeking assistance from alternative therapies in a desperate situation,’ Mr Fitzgerald said. ‘Dr Kenyon’s statement regarding his survival time, whether considered on its own or in the context of all the other communication with Patient A, was misleading.’Reporter Jonathan Ungoed-Thomas posed as the husband of a woman suffering from breast cancer during a meeting with Dr Kenyon in December 2012, during which he raised the subject of SPDT. Dr Kenyon explained the theory before telling him: ‘You don’t have to belong to a religion to believe in it. It’s not some wacky idea.’ He went on to say it was more effective than chemotherapy in similar cases claiming it resulted in ‘significant tumour cell death’ in 80 per cent of patients. He also suggested the rate of long-term survivors was just under 10 per cent. Dr Kenyon also repeated the key claims in later correspondence with Mr Ungoed-Thomas once he had revealed he was a journalist. Dr Kenyon maintains the treatment is effective and denies his actions were dishonest or misleading. In his witness statement he said: ‘I deny ever acting in a deliberately misleading or dishonest way towards anybody during the course of a consultation, whether a bona fide patient or otherwise’. Dr Kenyon runs The Dove Clinic, in Twyford, Hampshire and also has consulting rooms in Wimpole Street, central London.

"By . Mark Duell . Left in agony: Geoffrey Sharp, 74, called 999 after falling over at home in Oxford - but the medics who attended told him 'ambulances are for emergencies' A pensioner who broke his back in a fall was given two paracetamol tablets by paramedics - and told off for calling an ambulance. Geoffrey Sharp, 74, called 999 after falling over at home in Oxford - but the medics who attended told him ‘ambulances are for emergencies’, before leaving him in agony with a neighbour. The widower was left in ‘excruciating pain’ for three days before he managed to get to his GP - who diagnosed him with a fractured spine. Mr Sharp said that the paramedics angrily gestured towards their vehicle after arriving at his home, saying: ‘What does it say up there?’ The retired financial worker responded ‘emergency’, before one of them allegedly replied: ‘That’s right, for real emergencies, not people like you who have just had a fall.’ Mr Sharp claimed that the uncaring paramedics simply gave him two paracetamol tablets and left him with a neighbour. ‘I was in agony - it took me half an hour to haul myself up to my seat to call the ambulance in the first place,’ he said. ‘I am sure most ambulance crews do a wonderful job, but these guys just took the mickey.’ It was only when he got an appointment with his GP at the Botley Medical Centre, three days later, that Mr Sharp was told he had fractured his spine and was taken to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital. Treatment: Three days later and still in 'excruciating pain', Mr Sharp was told by his GP that he had fractured his spine - and was taken to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) ‘My doctor was furious,’ said the pensioner, who lost his wife Glenys three years ago on Christmas Eve, and whose son Danny died whilst serving in the Armed Forces. He complained to South Central Ambulance Service following the incident in August last year. Following an internal investigation, the service finally wrote back to Mr Sharp this week, with an apology for the ‘perceived rudeness’ of the crew. The ambulance service said that one of the paramedics involved had already left the trust, while the other had been spoken to ‘to ensure improvement in his future practice’. However, a spokesman said its internal investigation had found the decision not to take Mr Sharp to hospital was made with the consent of him and his doctor. Response: He complained to South Central Ambulance Service following the incident last year (file picture) This is disputed by Mr Sharp, who is now being cared for full-time by his daughter Wendy. 'I was in agony - it took me half an hour to haul myself up to my seat to call the ambulance in the first place.

This investigation ascertained that the clinical decisions were appropriate and were made in respect of the patient in conjunction with a doctor and in agreement with the patient at the time. ‘We are sorry to hear that Mr Sharp was not happy with our investigation. However, South Central Ambulance Service aims to provide the highest standards of response, care and treatment to our patients and the community. ‘Should Mr Sharp, or any complainant, not be content with our investigation, we would encourage them to contact us again so that we may conduct a further review.’","Geoffrey Sharp had called 999 after falling over at his home in Oxford .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An 11-year-old, basketball-mad boy with a rare orthopedic condition is getting his wish to have his leg amputated and allow him to live a richer life. Amit Vigoda, who lives in San Francisco, was born with congenital pseudoarthrosis of tibia and fibula with osteofibrous dysplasia, an agonizing condition which causes his right leg to continually fracture. He is in constant pain and can only walk with crutches, hop on one foot or crawl. Amit's condition is so excruciating that it wakes him in the middle of the night, screaming for his mother. Amit Vigoda, 11, has made the difficult but brave decision to have his right leg amputated below the knee. He suffers from a rare condition which causes his leg to continually fracture, leaving him in agonizing pain . Amit Vigoda, 11, was born with congenital pseudoarthrosis of tibia and fibula with osteofibrous dysplasia, an agonizing condition which causes his right leg to continually fracture . His mother Zimra Vigoda, who has three other children, wrote on her blog on parenting site Kveller: 'I awake to a familiar screech. ''Mommmmmyyyy……HELP!'' So begins my biweekly sleep-run to my 11-year-old’s bedside. '''Mommmmmyyyy……I want to cut it off, I can’t stand it anymore…I hate my leg… make it stop,'' he hollers, eyes wide open yet not quite awake.' Doctors diagnosed Amit with the rare condition when he was born with a broken leg. Amit has had multiple surgeries to correct the problem including internal rods and an 'external fixation' which saw rods, nuts and bolts fitted through the child's bone, muscle and tissue, his mother explained. The solution lasted only a year before the leg fractured again. Following one surgery aged nine, Amit was left in a wheelchair for seven months and had to learn to walk again with a brace. After years of watching her son suffer and swaying back and forth between encouraging her son to keep his leg and sacrificing the limb, the family reached a decision together. Painful decisions: Zimra Vigoda, pictured with her son Amit, has reached the difficult decision of agreeing to allow his right leg to be amputated to ease his constant pain . Despite many surgeries, Amit's leg has fractured continually since he was a baby. The 11-year-old has since decided to have his right leg amputated below the knee . Amit, who was born in Israel and moved to the Bay area 18 months ago, is due to have his below-the-knee amputation on April 10 at Shriner’s Hospital for Children in Sacramento, California. Six weeks later, he will be fitted for a prosthetic and within three months, it's hoped that Amit will be able to live the life he always dreamed - walking, running, playing soccer and hiking. Mrs Vigoda wrote: 'Now the die is cast, and his amputation surgery is scheduled for early April. This decision was not entirely mine–it was ours. 'Amit has chosen this route and his father and I, along with our family and friends, will be there with him.' Amit Vigoda adores playing wheelchair basketball and will return to the sport following his operation in April to pursue his dream of playing in the Paralympics . Amit is an avid soccer player and is hopeful that a prosthetic leg he will be fitted with will allow him to play the sport he loves . Following his operation, Amit will return to playing his beloved wheelchair basketball, which his mom describes as the most important thing in his life. The 11-year-old calls his coach Trooper Johnson his 'number one inspiration' and dreams of playing basketball in college or at the Paralympics. On his own blog, Amit wrote: 'This spring, I will take a huge step in this journey and amputate my right foot... This will allow me to live a much richer life and be more active and do more of what I love - soccer, running, biking, swimming and so on. 'I can tell you now that I am scared. This whole thing is freaking me out. I will probably not be as polite, or charismatic as I would like to appear but I promise you this - I will be candid and I will be real.'

"By . Joshua Gardner . The son of famed Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy accused of stabbing to death his ex-girlfriend had an unbelievably long history of violence against women that began when he was just 17. Documents show a trail of five terrorized girlfriends who Jared Remy, now 35, allegedly brutalized or threatened to kill beginning in the late 1990s and continuing steadily until his arrest for murder on August 15. Despite the endless accusations, constant threats and visible wounds sported by girlfriends and friends who crossed him, Boston-area judges only found the beloved baseball announcer's son guilty twice out of 18 total charges since 1998. Scroll down for video . Trail of terror: Jared Remy had already left behind a trail of terrorized women by the time police arrived to his Massachusetts home to find him covered in the blood of his girlfriend, who was stabbed to death by his side back in August . And the punishment those two times? Suspended sentences and nothing more. The Boston Globe dug deep into Remy's past and found nearly 20 years worth of glaring warning signs that the hulking admitted steroid abuser was capable of uncontrolled violence. But those warnings went unheeded. And, as the Globe writes, Remy became 'the king of second chances.' 'This is an old story for the American judicial system. You get a high-priced attorney, you get better justice,' former Lowell, Massachusetts prosecutor Joshua Friedman, who once tried and failed to  convince a jodge to give Remy a real punishment. 'If he had been Jared Smith from a well-off family, he may have gotten the same result.' While the story may be old, Remy's tale is far from typical. Not . only had he faced 18 criminal charges over the years by the time he . entered his not guilty plea to ruthlessly stabbing 27-year-old Jennifer . Martel, the mother of his daughter, but 10 of those times he walked free . despite being on probation or having pending charges. The Globe notes that Remy's allegedly abhorrent treatment of the females in his life first became noticeable in 1996. Just . after his son was asked to leave a special school for youths with . aggression problems, Jerry Remy asked Weston police to speak with Jared, . who was allegedly harassed and 'pushed' a girl he'd recently broken up . with. History of violence: The admitted steroid abuser collected nearly twenty criminal charges dating back to the late 1990s, but his violent history did not stop Boston-area judges from continually offering the son of a beloved Red Sox personality probation and continuances instead of harsher punishments . Unbelievable: Remy was in and out of the court system but was only ever given two guilty verdicts . Famous father: Remy's father is famed Red Sox broadcaster and former Big Leaguer Jerry Remy . It was the first of long list of progressively more serious accusations against the sportscaster scion. Remy's next girlfriend was Tiffany Guyette. She was three years his junior when they began dating. She would give birth to their baby at 16, when Jared was 19. The following year, in 1998, Remy would be charged with choking and hitting Guyette in his parents driveway while she held their baby. With the help of his attorney Peter Bella, Jared would get what is called a 'continuance without a finding,' or CWOF, which means Jared could be sentenced without the court actually ruling against him. He received one year of probation and was told he must get counseling. It was the first of a stunning six CWOFs that judges would hand Jared, largely for assaulting or threatening women. Jared Remy's wealthy parents paid for him to get some of the best legal representation  money could buy...and he needed it. The 35-year-old's run-ins with the law began in the mid 1990s and before the new millennium had already been accused of threatening his girlfriends. Six of Jared's criminal charges ended with a 'continuance without a finding' or CWOF. A CWOF allowed the judges to give Jared probation without actually determining his innocence or guilt. Jared was on probation after CWOF rulings, or had pending charges, at the time of 10 of his arrests . The first of these alleged incidents occurred in 1996, when a concerned Jerry Remy called police to speak with his son who he believed had threatened and pushed an ex-girlfriend at just 17. Jared's next girlfriend also became the mother of this baby. Tiffany Guyette was just 16 when she gave birth. Son after, Jared was accused of beating and choking her as she held their infant child. Later, he was accused of smashing a bottle of his friend's head for hanging out with Guyette. Lysa Gianacopolis accused Jared of threatening to kill her and of slashing her friend's car tires after the two of them broke up. Jared's girlfriend Ryan McMahon got a restraining order against Jared, who she said bloodied her nose and threatened her life, among other appalling acts. Jared racked up about 20 criminal charges before he finally was found covered in Jennifer Martell's blood last summer. Of those charges, he was found guilty just two times. Tragic: Martell accused Remy of threatening and abusing her in August 2013. She filed for a protective order, but didn't show up to court to have the emergency order extended. Remy was allowed to go free August 13, 2013. Two days later, Martell would be dead . Before his probation was up, Jared was charged with smashing a beer bottle over his friend's head, reportedly because the friend was involved with his now-ex girlfriend Guyette. He would receive another CWOF and an extended probation for that charge. Remy's next girlfriend Lysa Gianacopolis would also accuse him of threatening her, but after she failed to testify against him, the charges eventually faded away. In May of 2000, Remy got two more CWOFs: One for possession of hypodermic needles and another related to an incident in which he was reportedly causing a scene in his driveway as he screamed at his mother and then elbowed a responding police officer. The next girlfriend to allege that Remy beat her was Ryan McMahon. Most notable among his more dubious . interactions with McMahon was a 2003 incident in which Remy was booked . and then bailed out on charges he was terrorizing her and then allegedly . called to threaten McMahon twenty minutes after his arrest from front . right in front of the police station. Nearly . eight years went by before Martel was again charged with a violent . crime, an August 13, 2013 assault charge police filed on behalf of . Jennifer Martel. She was dead two days later. 'No parents are immune from trouble with their children,' said Jerry Remy. 'My wife and I did everything we could to provide Jared with the necessary professional help' In court, prosecutors described a brutal and determined attack, saying Remy assaulted Martel in the kitchen, living room, on a stairway and then pinned her to the ground in the patio where he stabbed her several times. Neighbors who tried to help Martel were driven back when Remy slashed at them, Middlesex Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern told a judge. Remy was arrested at the scene, his clothes soaked in the victim's blood. Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend. 'She said, ""I was planning my escape,""' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on Wednesday. She said, ""Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape.""' Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment to get her belongings before fleeing. Jared Remy's murder trial has been scheduled for October this year. He's pleaded not guilty and thus far has maintained that he's innocent of killing Martel. Horrific: Martel was in the midst of her escape from life with Remy when he allegedly surprised her in their home and stabbed her to death, leaving a trail of blood throughout the house . Witnesses: A neighbor at the couple's Waltham townhouse says he tried pulling Remy off of Martell, but it was no use. She was dead by the time help arrived .","Boston broadcaster Jerry Remy's son Jared Remy, 35, is charged with stabbing death of Jennifer Martel .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Israeli naval forces have raided a . ship in the Red Sea and seized dozens of advanced rockets from Iran which they claim were . destined for Palestinian militants in Gaza. The weapons cache would have significantly boosted their ability to strike Israeli citizens, the military said. The . ship carrying Syrian-made rockets was intercepted more than 1,000 miles . south of Israel, off the coasts of Sudan and Eritrea. Dangerous discovery: This photo released by the Israel Defense Forces shows one of the missiles found on a cargo ship off the coasts of Sudan and Eritera in the Red Sea . The . M-302 rockets have a range of up to 100 miles and would have . significantly improved the capabilities of Gaza militants, putting . nearly all of Israel in their range, a military spokesman said. Previously, Gaza militants have only been able to reach about 50 miles into Israel with their home grown M-75 missiles. There was no immediate comment from Iran or Gaza's Hamas rulers about the Israeli claims. Israeli . prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is visiting the US this week, . held a series of talks with Israeli defence officials ahead of the . ship's takeover. He later . spoke out against international relationships between Iran and western . countries and warned that may go nuclear after sanctions have been . relaxed. ‘At a time when . it talks with the world powers, at a time when Iran is smiling and . saying all sorts of pleasantries, that same Iran is sending lethal . weapons to terror organisations and it is doing it with an elaborate . network of covert global operations with the aim of streaming rockets, . missiles and other lethal weapons to harm innocent civilians' Find: Israeli naval forces raided a ship deep in the Red Sea early Wednesday and seized dozens of advanced rockets from Iran, allegedly destined for Palestinian militants in Gaza . Threat: The M-302 rockets have a range of up to 100 miles and would put nearly all of Israel in their range if they had reached their believed final destination, the Israeli army said . Video . released by the military showed Israeli soldiers on the ship inspecting . the rockets, shipped in large crates. The video also showed beige bags . containing cement with the words ‘Made in I.R. Iran,’ in English, . written on them. Israeli defence minister Moshe Yaalon said the weapons headed for Gaza were ‘strategically important’. ‘Iran . trains, funds and arms terror groups in the region and around the world . and its failed attempts to transfer the arms that were discovered this . morning is more proof of that,’ he said. The . operation, codenamed Full Disclosure, followed months of intelligence . gathering. The spokesman said the shipment originated in Syria, after . which the weapons were transported to Iran and then out to sea via Iraq. The . shipment was destined for Sudan, from where it was to be moved overland . through Egypt to Gaza, the army said.  Israel claims militants have . used similar routes in the past. The . 17 crew members of the ship, flying under a Panama flag, were not . suspects and were probably unaware of the content of their cargo, he . added. The vessel was being . brought to the port of Eilat, Israel's most southerly point, where the . crew would be released and the cache unloaded. It was expected to arrive . later this week. Way in: Israel believes the rockets would be smuggled into Gaza from Egypt by using the tunnel system connecting the two countries which is currently being rebuilt by Palestinians (pictured), after being destroyed by the Egyptian army following the Arab Spring revolution . Israel . accuses Iran of supplying rockets and other arms to its foes - militants . in Gaza and Lebanon's Hezbollah - and it has moved to intercept weapons . shipments in the past. Three . years ago, Israel seized the cargo ship Victoria loaded with weapons . allegedly sent by Iran to Gaza militants, including land-to-sea . missiles. In November 2009, . Israel took over the Iranian Francop vessel off the coast of Cyprus and . captured hundreds of tons of rockets, missiles, mortars, grenades and . anti-tank weapons on board that it said were headed to Hezbollah . guerrillas in Lebanon. Israel . is also suspected of carrying out airstrikes in Sudan on arms shipments . believed to be bound for Gaza. Israel has never confirmed carrying out . the strikes. In January . 2002, Israeli forces stormed the Karine A freighter on the Red Sea, and . confiscated what the military said was 50 tons of missiles, mortars, . rifles and ammunition headed for Palestinian militants in the Gaza . Strip. In May 2001, Israel . captured the vessel Santorini off its coastline, packed with explosives . Israel said were being sent from Hezbollah to Palestinian militant . groups. Anger: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pictured yesterday, hit back at western nations for engaging in talks with Iran and relaxing sanctions . Israel's foreign . ministry said Israeli troops boarded the ship in accordance with . international law and with the consent of the crew and the relevant . authorities. It said the ship was operated by a company registered in . the Marshall Islands. ‘The . missiles and weapons found on the ship were loaded and concealed by . Iran,’ it said. ‘The weapons were intended for Palestinian terror groups . in Gaza, who would use it to harm Israeli civilians, as they have done . in the past.’ It added that . Israel will lodge a formal complaint with the United Nations Security . Council and with a sanctions committee established under Security . Council resolution 1737. ‘In . terms of maritime law we have the right to board a ship we identify as . dealing with terror, carrying weapons that are meant to endanger the . state of Israel,’ Yedidia Yaari, a former chief of Israel's navy, told . Israeli Channel 10 TV. Another . former navy chief, Vice Admiral Eliezer Marom, said Iran's smuggling . efforts to Israel's enemies was almost a daily activity.

"By . Sara Nathan . The father of Olympic swimming champion Ryan Lochte today insisted he would never ask his $3million son for financial aid - despite losing his home to foreclosure. Steven Lochte, 61, spoke out as it was revealed he and his ex-wife Ileana lost their Florida home in October 2013 - even though their son has raked in millions of dollars in endorsements. And speaking from training, the swimming coach hit back at 'mean' reports that his son should have cleared his parents' debt, adding: 'It's not Ryan's problem, we would never ask him for help.' Mr Lochte and his ex-wife, who were divorced in 2011, now live in their own, separate homes, as he said: 'Everything's sorted, I have a town house, my ex-wife has her own home. We're all good.' Ryan Lochte and his mom Ileana Lochte pictured at swimming awards in 2011. The Olympic swimmer's mother and father Steven lost their Florida home to foreclosure in October, new court documents have revealed . Ryan Lochte in an undated photo with his father Steven. The Olympic swimmer's parents have lost their home in Port Orange, Florida . Foreclosure: CitiMortgage has taken control of the Lochtes' home in Port Orange, Florida after they failed to keep up with mortgage payments . Humble home: The Lochtes' one-story residence on Clearwater Road in Daytona Beach is situated on a patch of land surrounded by trees . When asked if Ryan had actually offered to help out, Mr Lochte said he would never have asked his famous son for aid. Mr Lochte said Ryan, who has moved from Florida to Charlotte to train at SwimMAC Carolina for the 2016 Rio Olympics, is 'excellent'. He added: 'He's back in the water and he starts full time training in February, he's getting ready for 2016.' The Lochtes, who have five children, were first sued by CitiMortgage in 2012. The bank has claimed they took a loan for $258,000 in 2007 which was due to be repaid at a rate of $1,609.58 a month. However, according to court documents first obtained by RadarOnline, the couple stopped making mortgage payments in 2011 and owed more than $242,000. The judge signed an order in favor of the bank for around $300,000. The bank is yet to put the suburban home up for auction. The Florida property is nestled among trees and, as might be expected, comes with a swimming pool. Ryan Lochte, left, is pictured alongside the men's relay team that took gold medals at the London 2012 Olympics . Ryan Lochte's Steven was arrested for DUI in 2010 . In 2012, Ileana Lochte, 60, told USA Today Sports that none of her children were aware of the foreclosure proceedings. She said: 'I just got divorced and I had lost my job and we're trying to work it out. 'I'm sad that the press thinks this is something to do with Ryan. 'We didn't discuss this with Ryan or any of my children, really. I would never allow him to help us.' That same month, Ryan's younger brother Devon, a one-time strong aspiring swimmer, was busted for allegedly selling marijuana to a police informant in Florida. 'He sold a confidential source two grams of cannabis for 40 bucks,' Officer Ben Tobias, spokesman for the Gainesville Police Department told MailOnline. Mrs Lochte is now believed to be living with her daughter Kristin at her home in Daytona Beach, Florida, according to official records. Ryan's earning potential rocketed following his success at the London Olympic Games in 2012. He had his own reality TV show What Would Ryan Lochte Do? on E! but it was canceled after one season. Prior to the 2012 Olympics, Fortune Magazine estimated that Lochte earned $2.3 million from endorsement deals with brands including Speedo Gatorade and Ralph Lauren. He now has an estimated net worth of $3million, according to reports. According to RadarOnline the Olympian was unable to help save his parents’ home. Born in New York, Ryan started swimming at . five years old and was coached by his swimming teacher father. He . qualified for his first Olympic Games in 2004. He has announced he will continue to swim professionally through to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The swimmer's parents stopped making mortgage payments just months after Steven Lochte  was arrested for a DUI in April 2010. A misdemeanor DUI meant that Mr Lochte was stripped of his license for one year, Gainesville police said. Lochte has numerous lucrative endorsements earning him millions including with sports drink Gatorade .","Final judgement on Steven and Ileana Lochte's Florida home took place on October 31 last year .

"By . Deni Kirkova . An obese mother-of-one has shed almost half her body weight to land her dream job as a PE teacher. Amy Richardson, 29, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, felt her ambition was slipping away because of her weight, which had rocketed to over 19 stone. Although she had studied sports development at university, Amy always felt a fraud because she was so big she had to wear men's sportswear, and couldn't walk up two flights of stairs without getting out breath. Amy pictured before the weight loss, left, and now, right, as Slimming World's Miss Slinky 2014 . Amy, who said she had always been a 'chubby child', often felt self-conscious when wearing a leotard for her favourite hobby of trampolining. But by going on a life-changing diet she managed to lose 7st 11lb, and slimmed from a size 24 to a slender 12. Now 11st 4.5lb, Amy finally teaches sports at a secondary school and feels full of energy, enjoying exercise and eating healthy home-made meals with her 17-month-old daughter Emily. She said her weight began to effect her everyday life when she went to university. 'It was the first time I'd lived away from home, I was eating all the wrong things and going out with my friends most nights. 'At the time I didn't think about what I . was eating and drinking at all, but looking back it's no wonder my . weight went up to more than 19 stone.' Amy Richardson lost almost 8 stone to achieve her childhood dream of becoming a PE teacher . She continued: 'My joints ached, I got out of breath . easily and I lost all my confidence. On nights out I'd just sit in the . corner while all my friends were on the dance floor. 'I felt like a fraud. I was doing sports development at . university, yet I found it difficult to climb the two flights of stairs . to my lectures and had to wear men's sportswear because of my size. 'I couldn't imagine any school wanting to employ an overweight PE teacher and I knew I needed to do something.' Her mother Lynne joined Slimming World in 2005, and a few months later Amy went along too, after a friend agreed to go with her. The effect was almost immediate. She cooked recipes from their website, and ditched takeaways and microwave meals in favour of making food from scratch. Her favourite things to cook include home made burgers with extra lean mince, homemade chips, and jacket potatoes with beans and salad. 'I taught myself how to cook lots of healthy meals and found things that I'd thought were bland before tasted so much better when I made them myself. 'I could still have treats like chocolate or alcohol too, so I didn't have to miss out on nights out, and lots of my friends didn't even realise I was slimming.' She added: 'Before I went to the . group I was scared, I worried what people would think of me and though I . might be the biggest person there. 'After a few weeks I saw how well it worked - I was even Slimmer of the Month - and I was hooked.' As the pounds melted away, Amy's energy and fitness levels improved, along with her confidence. Amy celebrates her weight loss at the Ritz Hotel in London today . After leaving university five stone slimmer, she successfully got a job as a PE teacher in 2008. 'I couldn't believe I'd achieved my dream and had the job I'd always wanted. There's no way I'd have been able to do this job at 19 stone. 'Now I can keep up with the kids, demonstrate things I want them to do, and I don't have to worry about my size at all. 'I've lost another 2st 11lbs since I've been at the school, and I think it's good for my students to see that I haven't followed some silly fad diet, I've lost weight sensibly and kept it off.' Amy, mother to 17-month-old Emily, has lost another 2st 11lbs since teaching at the school . Amy, who lives with fiance Chris and their daughter, has carried on with the classes every week, even during her pregnancy. She said: 'I always joke that I've taken the scenic route to my weight-loss journey. Right from the start I was determined that I didn't want a quick fix, I wanted to make a change for life, and I know I've definitely done that. 'I've never felt like I was missing out, and eating healthily and being active are just part of my life now. 'I know I'll be able to pass everything Slimming World's taught me onto Emily so she'll never have to struggle with her weight like I did, which is an amazing feeling. 'I've got the figure I always wanted, my dream job, the perfect fiance and a beautiful baby girl. Being named Slimming World's Miss Slinky 2014 is just the icing on the cake.'","Amy Richardson from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, lost 7st 11lb .

"By . Toni Jones . Trend-setting British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley made the world sit up and pay attention last week when she wore a tight ribbed vest on a trip to a Hollywood salon. The 25-year-old's pretty summer outfit featured a printed knee-length skirt, on-trend aviators and a coffee-coloured top showing off two very obvious nipple outlines. And now fashion tome Grazia is claiming that nipples could be one of the hot new style tricks of the spring season. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley sported the braless look last week in Hollywood prompting the fashion press to declare that nipples are back in style . The lingerie model is the latest star to brave the look now that spring has arrived . As an underwear model Rosie is used to her chest being the centre of attention and her lingerie line for M&S is currently the store's best-selling range. But it was her brave braless wardrobe choice that grabbed the attention of the fashion magazine, who claim that the saucy style option is a result of spring catwalk trends. Grazia Daily billed Rosie's look as a 'trend alert' today and said 'We reckon the wave of celebrities out and about (literally) could be down to the catwalk clothes of this season. 'Some . of spring/summer’s most significant trends call for styling sans . brassiere and flashing a risqué amount of flesh. Even Dior’s extremely . ladylike finale looks – which consisted of crew-neck black tees and . ankle-sweeping full skirts - were a little bit cheeky because the fine . gauge tops revealed a subtle hint of nip. 'Those ultra-deep V necklines on the runways of Christopher Kane and Celine are gathering apace, too. And that's before we even consider the crop tops, spaghetti straps, sporty sheer layers and all manner of strapless frocks around.' Anne Hathaway's perky Prada dress at the 2013 Oscars inspired the @HathawayNipple twitter handle . Blonde Rosie isn't the only star to whip off her bra. Fellow clothes horse Kate Moss is a huge fan of letting it all hang out when she is dressed down on her days away from the studio. And at the Oscars in February Anne Hathaway's perky Prada gown inspired a Twitter account dedicated to the actress's chest. Like . Angelina Jolie's left leg before her, Anne's nipples were accused of . making a bid for stardom and the @HathawayNipples Twitter handle soon had thousands of followers. Since then stylish stars Miranda Kerr, Nicole Scherzinger and Rihanna have all followed suit, letting their nipples slip in to view as a conscious part of their red carpet looks. Model Kate Moss is a big fan of dressing down and letting it all hang out when off duty and actress Charlize Theron favours a sheer top on sunny days . Subtle and very sexy: Rihanna at the GRAMMY Awards . And according to the latest research . these boho babes will be having the last laugh, as French scientists . claim that wearing a bra can actually make breasts more saggy. A 15 year study of French women came to the conclusion that wearing a bra does not prevent sagging or ease back . pain as commonly thought. Professor Jean-Denis Rouillon, from the . University of Besançon whocarried out the study said: 'Medically, physiologically, anatomically - breasts gain no benefit from . being denied gravity.' Bra experts Rigby & Peller, probably not surprisingly, remain unconvinced, claiming : 'Your breasts are composed mainly of fat and tissue and over time they . lose elasticity, wearing a bra every day can help prevent stretch marks . and sagging.' And M&S agree. Julia Mercer, Lingerie Fit Expert at M&S says 'The shape of the nation is changing.  Women are getting bigger and the average lingerie size has gone from a 34B to a 36C in the last decade so it’s become more important than ever to wear a bra for both comfort and support.  A good fitting bra can improve your poise and be a real confidence boost.'

"By . Ashley Collman . To catch a predator: 31-year-old Malik Taylor resigned from his position at a Manhattan high school in May after it was revealed he slept with four students . A former dean at a New York City High School, slept with four students, sexually harassed another four, and sent them all text messages and calls from his wife's cellphone. 31-year-old Malik Taylor was a 'community adviser' and dean at the Business of Sports School in Manhattan. Taylor resigned from his position on May 28, after one of the students he slept with reported his behavior, prompting a school district investigation. The school was made aware of his behavior when the 19-year-old student told another teacher, Tarawhona Bellevue, about the relationship and that she believed Taylor was in a relationship with one other student. But Taylor's abuses of power went further than two students. According to a report published by the Special Commissioner of Investigation, Taylor slept with four students and further harassed another four students during his one year at the school. One of the students was so troubled by her affair with the dean that she ran away. Others had to deal with sexual comments directed at them in the school hallway like 'Why do you have such a big  breasts?' He kept in contact with the students using his wife's cell phone and even admitted to having intercourse with two of the students in empty classrooms after school. The student who reported the crime said that soon after she met Taylor, the month he was started at the school, he began making jokes about her and lewd comments about her buttocks. He regularly told her that her 'ass is ridiculous' and mentioned his daughter - but she believed he was unmarried. One day while in the cafeteria, he grabbed her buttocks, and when she confronted him he said 'I just had to.' Somehow he got her phone number and started texting her from his wife's phone, asking the girl to give him a chance. She relented and in February 2013, he drove her into Manhattan where they ate gyros. Afterwards he asked her to go to a motel ad she consented. According to the report 'she agreed because Taylor basically had beaten her down over the months with requests to be intimate with her.' They would have sex on one other occasion, three weeks later at a downtown Manhattan motel. Taylor did not wear protection either time. While two of the other girls he had sex with were 17 (the age of consent in New York) one was not. Resigned: After finding out that one of the students he had sex with reported him to school administrators, Taylor resigned. He had worked at Business of Sports school for one year . He had sex with a 16-year-old about five times, and admittedly twice in a classroom after school. When he was interviewed in June by investigators, he said he knew the student was 16 when he had intercourse with her. And those weren't the only times he had trysts in empty classrooms. He said he had sex twice in an empty classroom with one 17-year-old student. This student believed they were in an exclusive relationship when he 'started talking to her in a a more romantic way.' The final student he had sex with is the most mysterious. The 16-year-old student told investigators that this other student 'really had feelings for him' and that he once asked her if she wanted to have a threesome with the 16-year-old, but she declined. According to the student who first reported Taylor, something happened between the fourth student and Taylor that caused her to be angry, and the girl ran away. Investigators tried to contact this mystery fourth student, but were unsuccessful. Taylor was less successful wooing four other students. One 17-year-old student described Taylor once approaching her on the school elevator and asking her 'You know how I recognize you?' and then pointing to her buttocks. She said that comment made her feel 'scared' of Taylor. He also told her that he would like to date her and that made her feel 'disgusted and not safe.' One of her friends said that Taylor asked the student why her butt was so big in the hallway on several occasions, and once turned his harassment to her asking 'Why do you have such big breasts?' Trysts: Taylor took one of the students to the Capri Motel in the Bronx, according to the report . He once got another student out of class and told her to meet him at the local McDonald's. She says at the restaurant he asked her to get marijuana and meet him at his house. She took his number but did not get the marijuana or meet up with him. Taylor denies asking her over to his house. When interviewed, Taylor said the girl had a drug problem and he did not ask her to his house. On another occasion he told the same student that he was going to 'f*** the s*** out of' her and she told him she didn't want to have sex with him. Taylor asked if he could 'at least suck on her boobs?' He then told her not to tell anyone about her conversation, because he knew where she lived. She wasn't sure if that was a threat since he was laughing. He asked another student to walk down the stairs in front of him so he could see her 'a** shake' and held the door open for her saying 'there's not enough room for me and your big a**.' The New York Post reports that Taylor is currently in Georgia visiting relatives. The school district has referred the case to both the Manhattan and Brooklyn District Attorney's Offices.","Malik Taylor, 31, worked at the Business of Sports School in Manhattan .

"David Cameron has claimed a seven pence bulldog clip on his expenses, along with 26p for 'banner bar tags' and 38p for a staple remover despite earning £142,500-a-year. Processing the claim for the paper clip costs six times as much as its own value, and the claim for the banner tags will also have cost the Government more than it recouped for the PM. According to the latest figures from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) Cameron has made a total of 72 claims since April last year, totalling £1,790. David Cameron has claimed seven pence for bulldog clips on expenses, a claim that will cost an average of six times more than its value to process . Ipsa’s annual running costs are £6million and it processes about 210,000 claims a year, making the average cost of processing a single claim 28.6p. The new claims also include £577 for legal expenses insurance, £234.32 for food and drink for work experience students, and £28 on a taxi. Cameron has a past record of claiming small amounts on stationary, asking for 14 pence for  more bulldog clips and 17 pence for staples in early 2013. Cameron, who is paid £142,500-a-year, also claimed £577 for legal insurance and £28 for a taxi . Ipsa was set up following the MP's expenses scandal five years ago, and at the time Cameron said the commons had been 'deeply mired' in the revelations. Cameron himself repaid £937 in expenses, including £680 for repair work at his home address. At the time he said: 'I don’t care if they were within the rules. They were wrong. I want to say sorry it’s come to this and sorry for the actions of some Tory MPs.' The PM is estimated to be worth £4million and has inherited £300,000 from his stockbroker father.","David Cameron has filed a seven pence expenses claim for bulldog clips .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Google is to be hit with a multi-million pound bill as the taxman steps up the fight against aggressive tax dodging in Britain. The American internet giant is expected to pay at least £24million in backdated tax following a review of its operations by HM Revenue & Customs. It follows an angry backlash against the company over its tiny tax bill. Google is to be hit with a multi-million pound bill as the taxman steps up the fight against tax dodging . Google paid just £11.6million in corporation tax in Britain in 2012 despite sales here of £3billion and profits of nearly £900million. Other multinational companies have also come under fire for reducing their tax bills including Starbucks, Amazon and Facebook. HMRC and the government have been criticised for pursuing small companies and individuals over their tax affairs but letting powerful corporations off the hook. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the public accounts committee of MPs, has accused ministers of ‘presiding over a seemingly growing tax bonanza for global internet companies’. MP Margaret Hodge said it was ¿extremely depressing¿ to see global companies failing to pay their fair share of UK tax . She said it was ‘extremely depressing’ to see global companies failing to pay their fair share of UK tax. Firms including Google and other tech giants have set up intricate global structures involving low tax regimes which mean they can legally reduce the amount of tax they pay in the UK. Google funnels much of the business it does in Britain through Ireland but also uses Bermuda to help lower its overall tax bill further. But with a review launched in 2010 by HMRC into Google’s finances close to completion, the company now faces paying £24million in backdated taxes. The charge relates to shares given to Google staff in London and the way such share-based pay is treated for tax purposes. Google’s 2,000 staff in London are given shares each year by the US parent company. The shares were worth £51million in 2011 and £50million in 2012. In the past, the payments have been used to help lower the company’s UK tax bill but a crackdown by HMRC has seen the rules change. Google has already set aside £24million to cover the extra corporation tax it expects it will owe for 2005 to 2011. It said it is ‘a matter the company is discussing with HMRC’. Heather Self, a tax expert at Pinsent Mason law firm, said: ‘The government clarified the rules on tax deductions for share schemes to make it clear that aggressive positions taken by some companies would not be tolerated for the future.’ A spokesman for HMRC said: ‘HMRC does not discuss the affairs of individual companies, but we ensure that multinationals pay the tax due in accordance with UK tax law. ‘We man-mark the most complex and potentially high risk businesses and, since 2010, we have collected over £23billion in extra tax through challenging large businesses’ tax arrangements. 'We relentlessly pursue businesses which don’t play by the rules and these results reflect this.’ Google said: ‘Like most multinationals, we pay the bulk of our corporate tax bill where our business originated - in our case the US. We’re a significant contributor to the UK economy having created over 2,000 jobs.","American company is expected to pay at least £24million in backdated tax .

"By . Emma Innes . A toddler is battling a rare condition that keeps erasing her personality and all the skills she has learnt. Evelyn Kealy, who is 22 months, has been diagnosed with West syndrome, a rare and serious form of epilepsy in infants. At her worst, she was having up to 200 seizures a day and was given just 11 months to live. Evelyn Kealy (pictured with her mother, Lisa) has West syndrome which is a form of epilepsy. Every time she has a seizure she forgets all of the skills she has learnt and her personality changes . Every time she has a relapse, she loses all of the skills she has learnt, including the ability to smile and giggle. She even likes different foods and toys. Her mother, Lisa, 36, and father, Paul, 35, even say that it is like having a newborn baby all over again. ‘After each episode, it feels like we have lost a daughter and gained a new one,’ said Mrs Kealy. ‘We bought her a really cute musical cot mobile with little pink bears, and it always used to calm her and make her smile. But then afterwards, she would cry as soon as we switched it on!’ But Evelyn’s parents could not be prouder of her. Mrs Kealy said: ‘Evelyn has been through a lot, but she keeps on smiling. She still can’t walk, talk or feed herself, but she keeps on getting better and we are hopeful that things will continue to improve.’ Evelyn (pictured with her father, Paul) has sight and hearing problems as a result of her seizures and has not yet learnt to walk, talk or feed herself . When she was diagnosed, Evelyn's parents were told she was unlikely to live for much more than a year but she was then put on a new drug which has dramatically improved her health - she has not relapsed for a year . Because of her condition, Evelyn requires round-the-clock care and her seizures have also left her with hearing loss and visual impairment. She was diagnosed at just three-months-old after her mother noticed she was jerking in her highchair at their home in Syston, Leicestershire. After she was rushed by ambulance to the A&E department at Leicester Royal Infirmary, an EEG scan confirmed she had West syndrome. Mrs Kealy and her road worker husband were devastated by the diagnosis, but quickly pulled themselves together for the sake of Evelyn and their other daughter, Mary-Kate. Evelyn was diagnosed with West syndrome when she was three-months-old. Her mother took her to hospital when she noticed her jerking in her high chair. An EEG (pictured) confirmed the diagnosis . Evelyn was put on steroids which caused her to gain two stone in just eight weeks (pictured). She had to wear clothes made for a five-year-old and her mother was told her condition was the worst the doctor had ever seen . Mrs Kealy said: ‘At first, we cried. But we realised that we were parents to two children and had responsibilities, so instead we threw ourselves into researching the condition. ‘The doctors were explaining things in medical terms, and I didn’t understand what they were talking about. I wanted to know exactly what they were saying to me.’ For the next three months, Mrs Kealy stayed by Evelyn’s side in hospital as she underwent a series of tests. Her husband would pick Mary-Kate up from school after work and drive straight to the hospital so the sisters could bond. Eventually, Evelyn was discharged from the hospital, but her health deteriorated after she suffered side effects of a steroid medication prescribed to prevent her seizures. Evelyn's sister Mary-Kate (pictured with Evelyn), eight, says she is extremely proud of her 'special sister' In just eight weeks, she gained two stone in weight and was forced to wear clothes for five-year-olds. During a hospital appointment, distraught Mrs Kealy was informed by a neurologist that Evelyn’s EEG scan was the worst he had ever seen, and it was unlikely she would live past 14 months. He offered only one alternative - a medication called Vigabatrin that could help to save her life. Mrs Kealy said: ‘I managed to hold it together until I got back to my car, and then I completely fell apart. I just didn’t know what to do. I thought we’d lose her. ‘But I still had to pick Mary-Kate up from school, so I took a deep breath, put my makeup on and tried to stay strong.’ Miraculously, the medication worked and Evelyn has been relapse-free since Christmas last year. Evelyn could have another seizure at any time but, for now, her parents say they are just enjoying getting to know her as she is . Whilst aware a seizure could take Evelyn from them again, Mr and Mrs Kealy are enjoying getting to know their daughter. In fact, Mrs Kealy says Evelyn is a positive influence on the whole family, saying that she has taught them to be more ‘humble’ and appreciative of their health. Office manager Mrs Kealy said: ‘We have a really good life, and we are a very happy family. It’s important for people to know that it isn’t the end of the world if their child is born with this condition, or any other disability. ‘Mary-Kate loves that Evelyn is different from all the other children. She is always saying how proud she is of her “special sister”, and how no-one else has a sister like Evelyn. Mrs Kealy said: 'We have a really good life, and we are a very happy family. It's important for people to know that it isn't the end of the world if their child is born with this condition, or any other disability' ‘At first I questioned if we would ever be able to cope, but this is our norm now - it doesn’t feel strange to us any more. ‘Evelyn is such a funny little character, and I wouldn’t change her for the world.’ West syndrome, which affects just one in 4,000 children, is characterised by infantile spasms, which make the sufferer bow forwards or backwards. In 90 per cent of cases, the spasms start before the child is one and will usually continue as they get older. Often West syndrome is mistaken for colic, as the spasms are initially irregular and the cries the child makes during or after the seizure are very similar. Each episode typically lasts only one or . two seconds, but the effects can be devastating, and many children will . develop lifelong learning difficulties. Mrs Kealy said: 'At first I questioned if we would ever be able to cope, but this is our norm now - it doesn't feel strange to us any more' Each episode typically lasts only one or two seconds, but the effects can be devastating, and many children will develop lifelong learning difficulties. Dr Nahin Hussain, Consultant Paediatric Neurologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said: ‘Evelyn’s loss of developmental skills is known as regression - in essence she is developing backwards. ‘It is absolutely essential that West syndrome is diagnosed and treated early, as the longer the syndrome is left untreated, the greater the risk that the child will develop severe developmental problems - including learning difficulties. ‘West syndrome is one of the most severe forms of epilepsy, and we will continue to monitor Evelyn as the pattern of seizures can change over time. ‘But Evelyn is responding to her medication, and is progressing well.’ For more information on West syndrome, visit www.wssg.org.uk . West syndrome is a rare and serious form of epilepsy in infants. It usually occurs in babies between the ages of three-months and one. It affects one in 4,000 to 6,000 children and is more common in boys than girls. The condition usually starts with brief, infrequent attacks and is often initially misdiagnosed as colic. The seizures usually see the child bend forward with stiff arms and legs. Typically, each episode lasts a few seconds and there is then a pause followed by a further spasm. Many babies with the condition see their development slow or even reverse until the spasms are brought under control. Many children with West syndrome go on to have other kinds of seizures later in childhood and a lot have learning difficulties. The prognosis depends on the underlying cause of the condition.

"By . Matt Barlow . Tim Sherwood admits the boardroom ‘silence is deafening’ at Tottenham and fears he will be ousted from his job in the summer. Chairman Daniel Levy was not at Chelsea on Saturday to see Spurs crashing to a 4-0 defeat which damaged their chances of returning to the Champions League, which seems to be Sherwood’s best way of somehow avoiding the axe. Levy has made no attempt to refute the popular theory that Holland boss Louis van Gaal is primed to take over after the World Cup and, caught up in the emotion of losing heavily, Sherwood said: ‘The silence is deafening, isn’t it? It’s up to Daniel. I didn’t know if he was at the game or not. Maybe he was travelling. VIDEO Scroll down to see Tim Sherwood's comments after the Chelsea match . Not good enough: Tim Sherwood was fuming after Tottenham's 4-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . Not happy? Daniel Levy has been silent about the rumours involving Louis Van Gaal coming to the club . Chance: The Dutch manager has admitted a Premier League switch is appealing to him in the summer . ‘One thing I guarantee is that no one . cares more than me. I want the team to do very well and it hurts me when . they don’t. I’m afraid I need people in that dressing room to be . hurting like I am.’ Sherwood was appointed in December to replace Andre . Villas-Boas and handed his first chance to manage at senior level with . an 18-month contract, but appears resigned to becoming the eighth . manager sacked by Levy in 13 years. Sporting . director Franco Baldini’s future also appears in jeopardy after Spurs . lured former chief scout Ian Broomfield back to the club by hijacking a . proposed switch from QPR’s scouting team to Arsenal’s. Tottenham . insist Baldini, who arrived only last year, and Broomfield will work in . tandem but Levy seems determined to restructure again behind the scenes . at White Hart Lane. Sherwood is understood to have not been consulted . about Broomfield’s return. Despite . his inexperience, Sherwood has made it clear he has no desire to work . as assistant to a new manager but hinted for the first time that he may . be interested in a technical director’s role, a more powerful version of . his previous position as technical coordinator with added . responsibility for strategy through the club. ‘I feel I can do the No.1 job but I’d be no good as a No.2, I’m too opinionated. I wouldn’t want to do the job,’ said Sherwood. ‘There . is a place for a technical director, someone who sees the club from . bottom to top of the training field. There’s a definite place for that, . otherwise you get no continuity and end up buying seven or 10 players . every window and your turnover of players is too great.’ Chelsea players know how to win matches. There have been plenty of dives this season, the clearest from Ramires to preserve the Blues’ unbeaten home record, against West Brom. Others Jose Mourinho has admitted but still benefited from. On Saturday evening, Samuel Eto’o didn’t dive but played very cleverly for the decisive penalty, which Michael Oliver awarded after 59 minutes at Stamford Bridge. Eto’o gets ahead of defenders and then slows his stride to draw contact. This time, it was a small push from Younes Kaboul, which replays just about found. It was a soft penalty but not a wrong one from Oliver. He did very well to detect contact at full speed. However, he then decided Kaboul had denied an obvious goalscoring chance, so he dismissed him. As Eto’o did not have control of the ball and was not heading directly towards goal, I don’t agree with the red. Spurs could well have the card overturned. Not enough leaders: Sherwood casts an evil eye at midfielder Nabil Bentaleb at the end of the game . The . win against Spurs extended Jose Mourinho’s unbeaten record in the . Barclays Premier League at Stamford Bridge to 75 games. He has won 193 . points from a possible 225. If . there is friction behind the scenes, there was also friction on the . touchline at Stamford Bridge, where Sherwood clashed angrily with . Chelsea coach Steve Holland. ‘I . thought his comments were a little bit patronising,’ said Sherwood. ‘I’m not sure what he actually said, and to be honest I was in that kind . of mood to blow up with anyone so no hard feelings.’ The . Spurs boss was also unable to mask his feelings about his own players . after what he described as another ‘gutless’ disintegration to go with . 6-0 and 5-1 defeats against Manchester City and a 5-0 defeat at home to . Liverpool. ‘We lack something don’t we?’ said Sherwood when asked about his on-field leaders. ‘Capitulations are happening too often. ‘In . adversity, when things go against us, that’s when we go missing. You . either have that in you or you haven’t. We need to stand up and be . counted sooner rather than later.’ Spurs performed well for 56 minutes until Jan Vertonghen’s mistake gifted Samuel Eto’o the first. Then they fell apart. Younes . Kaboul was sent off after conceding a penalty for Chelsea’s second and . captain Michael Dawson pulled a hamstring and limped off. Defensive . problems loom ahead of Sunday’s North London derby. Dawson, . Vlad Chiriches and Etienne Capoue, who can play at the back, are . injured and Kaboul will be banned. The only senior centre-half available . is Vertonghen, who says he wants out if Spurs do not make the Champions . League and was responsible for sparking Saturday’s collapse and . culpable in the third scored by Demba Ba. Despondent: Aaron Lennon refused pushed Stefan Freund's hand away after the final whistle . Team spirit? The players were accused of not caring as much as their passionate boss . At . the end, few Spurs players acknowledged their supporters and when coach . Steffen Freund tried to usher Aaron Lennon towards them, Lennon pushed . Freund’s arm away and stormed down the tunnel. ‘They . should walk down there,’ said Sherwood.’I told them to go down there. You can understand their disappointment but those fans are disappointed . too and those fans are second to none. It’s important our players . acknowledge them.’ Mourinho . defended Eto’o against accusations that he played to win Chelsea’s . penalty and insisted football’s divers were not to be found at Stamford . Bridge. The Chelsea manager . did not name Luis Suarez but there was a sly dig involved as he tackled . the subject of deliberately trying to get opposing goalkeepers sent off. ‘We . had big opportunity in the second minute of the game when other players . with other shirts the players would go for a penalty and a red card for . the keeper,’ said the Chelsea boss. ‘Eden . Hazard doesn’t do that and he misses from a difficult angle. He tries . to go away from the keeper, while other important players in this league . they attack the keeper.. ‘You know the kings of the penalites,’ said Mourinho. ‘You know where they are and they’re not here.’ Easy: Chelsea ran riot on Saturday . Instead, . the Chelsea boss praised the predatory instincts of Eto’o, who is 33 . today,(MON) ‘Eto’o was brilliant,’ said Mourinho. ‘You can speak about . Vertonghen’s mistake but it was only Vertonghen’s mistake because Eto’o . is there. If Eto’o does not read the situation the defender or the . goalkeeper will get the ball. ‘He’s . not a 20 years old super-fast player like he was 10 years ago, so he . needs to be close to the goal, he needs his feet in the box and he’s . very intelligent in the way he moves. Eto’o . started against Spurs only because Fernando Torres was injured in the . warm-up and is likely to miss at least two weeks as Chelsea sprint clear . in the title race and attempt to reach the last eight of the Champions . League. Mourinho believes . the Champions League will play a part in the title race, but believes . both Manchester City and Manchester United can overturn their first leg . defeats in Europe. ‘They . lost at home, but can’t Manchester City win in Barcelona?’ said the . Chelsea manager. ‘No? Barcelona lost to Valladollid and lost at home to . Valencia. Why can’t they win? Why can’t Man United change that result . against Olympiakos? I think they can. I think they’re going through. Arsenal at Bayern, can they win 2-0 and go to extra time? Difficult, . probably the most difficult of the three but they can.’","Tim Sherwood slammed his Tottenham team after the 4-0 defeat to Chelsea .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had a surveillance system the night that Justin Casquejo made it to the top of One World Trade Center, bypassing security. The only problem is the $4,000 system was still packed in its box at the time. Although the Port Authority bought the system in August, officials didn't want to pay to install it, the New York Post reported today. A source told the paper that the official who oversaw the purchase was so incensed at what he saw as a very high price for a two-camera system that he decided not to spend any more money to have it up and running. Scroll down for video . Daredevil: Justin Casquejo, 16, sneaked into the WTC site and spent almost two hours on the roof of the nearly completed Freedom Tower, he is pictured at right on top of a construction crane in nearby Hoboken . Fascinated: Casquejo has long been obsessed with the WTC's Freedom Tower, according to the Post . 'He looked at me and my colleague and said, 'Why did I spend $4,000 on this equipment when you could have gone to Home Depot and gotten something cheaper?’’' the source, who is an electrician that worked on the project for a vendor, said. Thrillseeker: Casquejo, pictured on a construction crane in Hoboken, appears to love sneaking into tall buildings under construction . The system . ordered is known as a '“Two-Camera DVR Solution System.” It was supposed . to be installed quickly after the August purchase, the source added, to . protect the spire that was hoisted in place in May. The spire also . contains a critically important antenna. A . Port Authority spokesman said that the system wasn't installed because . infrastructure to support the system had not yet reached the top of the . 104-floor building, which is still under construction. In the early morning hours of March 16, Casquejo, 16, accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by . slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4 a.m., . He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing . scaffolding. Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper. He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof. Accused: Casquejo faces a criminal trespass charge for his WTC stunt, but appears to have gotten away with climbing a construction crane in Hoboken (right) Casquejo scaled equipment on the roof to reach the 1,776-foot tall Freedom Tower's antenna.

"By . Hayley O'keeffe . A Chinese woman has spoken about giving birth to IVF twins and becoming the country's oldest mother at 60. Sheng Hailin decided that she wanted to become a mother again after her daughter, 29, was killed by carbon monoxide poisoning in 2009. In a rare move for the country which enforces a one child policy, a military hospital in Heifei agreed to to give Mrs Hailin and her husband IVF treatment. The twins' father Wu Jingzhou carries his daughters after his sixty-year-old wife, gave birth in 2010 . In 2010 she gave birth to daughters Zhizhi and Huihui who are now aged three. Mrs Hailin said that she and her husband wanted to have the twins to 'survive and free myself from the loneliness.' But because of the arrivals instead of preparing for retirement Mrs Hailin has had to increase her work schedule, and complained that she does not get to spend as much time with her young family as she would like. Mrs Hailin shortly after giving birth aged 60. Her twins are now three, and the older mother says she is having to worker harder than ever to support them . One of the baby girls, which the couple named Zhizhi and Huihui. The twins are now three years old . She told the China Daily: 'For the baby girls, I have given out all I have.' The mother, who works as a health lecturer, added: 'Some lectures may only last one day, but sometimes I have to stay three or four days in one place. 'I could only spend four or five days at home with my children in a month. I'm 64 now and my body is old.' In November this year, the Chinese government announced couples could have two children if one parent is an only child. An estimated one million families in the country have lost their sole descendant since the one child policy took effect in the late 1970s, and another four to seven million are expected to do so in the next 20 to 30 years. Such families face uncertain futures, with no one to help them through old age in a country which emphasises family life. Video Source Bon .

"By . Martin Robinson . A 'monster' mother whose toddler died after she subjected him to months of terrifying violent abuse has been jailed for at least 18 years today. Two-year-old Keanu Williams, who was known to police and children’s services, was beaten to death by Rebecca Shuttleworth, who was given a life sentence this afternoon. Keanu was found dead with 37 injuries including bite marks, a fractured skull and a fist-sized tear in his stomach. Scroll down for video . Innocence: Keanu Williams, left, beams at the camera in this family photo which gives no hint at the cruelty he would suffer at the hand of his evil mother Rebecca Shuttleworth, right, who was jailed today . He was hit repeatedly with a stick or rod over 48 hours and died of internal bleeding, a post-mortem examination found. Paramedics discovered his body at the . home of Shuttleworth’s then boyfriend, Luke Southerton, 32. Shuttleworth, who was sentenced by Mr Justice Spencer at Birmingham Crown Court, had also been found guilty of four counts of child cruelty. The judge, who also passed concurrent sentences for child cruelty totalling four years, told Shuttleworth: 'The jury have convicted you of the brutal murder of your two-year-old son. 'He was a defenceless child and it was your duty to protect him. Instead you beat him so severely he died a lingering death from his injuries a day or so later. 'You have also been convicted of cruelty by failing to summon the medical aid he so badly needed.' Paying tribute to Keanu, the judge added: 'He was a delightful little boy described as a real character, a little entertainer who remained cheerful despite everything. 'Joyful was the word that more than one witness used to describe him - he was a favourite at nursery as well as within the family. 'His death has left a void in many live which will never be filled.' Although the judge accepted that Shuttleworth had experienced her share of tragedy in losing her mother and grandmother following a 'troubling' upbringing, he said she had shown a cruel and vicious streak towards Keanu. As Shuttleworth wept in the dock, the judge added: 'By the jury's verdict, you alone were responsible for the violence which led to Keanu's death. 'One can scarcely imagine the pain and distress Keanu must have suffered from this outburst of violence. 'He must have been terrified, it must have been clear to you as soon as the violence had taken place that Keanu was badly in need of medical attention.' Callous: Rebecca Shuttleworth, left, was . convicted of murdering her son, two, after a long period of torture, . while her former partner Luke Southerton, right, was cleared of murder . but convicted of cruelty . Shuttleworth had decided not to seek medical help because she knew his injuries, including internal bleeding to his abdomen, could not be explained away, the judge said. Explaining how he had arrived at the 18-year minimum term, the judge said the murder was aggravated by several factors. Outlining some of the aggravating features of the case, the judge told Shuttleworth: 'Keanu was particularly vulnerable because of his age. 'His was a lingering death over many hours following a brutal assault by his own mother. 'This was the grossest abuse of a position of trust - you were his mother and it was your most basic and natural duty to protect him. 'I accept that there was no intention to kill but this was a brutal and sustained attack.' Shuttleworth's partner, Luke Southerton, was cleared of murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child, but convicted of one incident of cruelty towards Keanu during which he was bitten, apparently in an attempt to stop him biting other people. Southerton, 32, was given a nine-month jail term suspended for two years, and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work for the community. Innocent: Keanu Williams, pictured,  plays with a bucket of water, and died on January 9 2011 after being admitted to hospital with multiple injuries . Shocking: A a body map details the harrowing injuries sustained by Keanu Williams . Brutal: The jury in his mother's trial heard that the two-year-old sustained 37 separated injuries to his body when discovered by paramedics . A review has . begun into why social workers failed to spot the abuse. Keanu’s injuries were not ‘isolated’ but part of a long chain of abuse by his mother, who now faces life behind bars. Yet Shuttleworth, 25, had duped officials into thinking she was ‘caring and competent’. It adds to questions about children’s . services at Labour-run Birmingham City Council, rated ‘inadequate’ since . 2009 after deaths of children known to social workers. Cases include . that of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, starved to death in 2008. Last month the department was labelled ‘utter chaos’ by members of its own watchdog. Yesterday Jane Held, head of the . Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, which is reviewing Keanu’s . death, said social services, medics and police ‘missed a significant . number of opportunities to intervene’. Birmingham Crown Court heard that Shuttleworth had ‘resented’ Keanu virtually from his birth in 2008. Shuttleworth, who was living with . Keanu’s father in Torquay, Devon, saw the child as an ‘obstruction to . living her life as she wanted’, the jury was told. Prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC said . she spent much of her childhood in care as her alcoholic mother . struggled to cope, giving her ‘considerable experience of the care . system’. Denial: Rebecca Shuttleworth and Luke Southerton, pictured together in the dock of Birmingham Crown Court, both denied murder. She was found guilty, he was cleared . Keanu Williams' family has been 'torn apart' by his death, according to his aunt. Angela Shuttleworth, 26, Rebecca Shuttleworth's sister, said the death of the toddler who was known in the family as Kiwi had left 'a gaping hole in our lives'. In a statement she said: 'Keanu was an amazing little boy who had developed a real personality. 'He was full of life and loved playing with his siblings and cousins. He enjoyed all his toys and would empty the toy box every time he came to play, but he especially loved Iggle Piggle from (children's television programme) In The Night Garden . 'Kiwi also loved food - he ate everything and was hungry all the time.' She added: 'Since the tragic death of Kiwi, we haven't been able to grieve or say goodbye to him properly. 'The whole family has been torn apart by this and his death has left a gaping hole in our lives. 'We hope now this is over we can lay Kiwi to rest and begin to have some closure.' Following Keanu’s birth she received . ‘extensive’ support from health and social workers, posing as an . ‘attentive’ mother at parenting classes. She moved back to her home city of Birmingham when Keanu was 15 months old, starting a relationship with Southerton. Mr Hotten said Shuttleworth used her . knowledge of the care system to ‘manipulate social workers, teachers, . doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and . caring mother’. She told staff at the child’s nursery his bruises came . from bumps or falls. In December 2010, she took Keanu to hospital with burned feet, which she claimed came from a radiator beside his bed. She was told police would inspect her home, and texted Southerton to make sure their stories matched up. A month later, paramedics found the . boy dead at the flat in the deprived Ward End suburb. The couple had . dialled 999, claiming Keanu had had a heart attack. Mr Hotten told the . jury Shuttleworth hoped he would ‘get better’ and only called 999 when . she realised it was hopeless. Detective Chief Inspector Caroline . Marsh, who led the investigation for West Midlands Police, said: ‘In the . past, I have described her as a monster and perhaps I would stand by . that.’ The force would not comment on its prior involvement in the case because of the review. Southerton was cleared of murder, . manslaughter and causing or allowing the death, but convicted of cruelty . yesterday after a six-month trial. Shuttleworth, who was convicted of four counts of child cruelty as well as murder, will be sentenced alongside him today. She has been on bail throughout the case and attended court with a woman she was heard to describe as her ‘partner’.

"By . Luke Garratt . A pensioner is claiming he has cured himself of diabetes - thanks to two intense 12-minute work outs  a week. John Hall, 67, of Radford in Coventry, suffered so badly from the condition he was worried it would kill him any minute. He had been classed as having a high risk of a heart attack or stroke, and it got to the point where his condition was so bad he feared going to sleep in case he failed to wake up. John Hall, a 67-year-old pensioner from Radford in Coventry has claimed that his intense 12-minute exercise routine twice a week has cured his diabetes and halved his cholesterol . Doctors were stunned when they saw the results of the short bursts of exercise, and have begun to consider weaning him off of his diabetes medication . For seven years the retired Coventry . City Council officer battled the condition, failing to reduce his . dangerously high cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure levels. He altered his diet and walked five miles a day, but nothing helped his condition. In . a last ditch effort he began exercising in two 12-minute bursts a week, . a fraction of the recommended two and a half hours, but he claims this has turned his life around. His . sessions, which take place at his local community centre in Radford, . consist of warm ups and then a series of high intensity aerobic . activity. The programme supports new thinking that short, intense, exercise sessions can be just as beneficial as longer work-out regimes. Mr Hall joined four months ago in which time his glucose and cholesterol levels, which were nearly double what they should be, have almost halved. His reduced blood sugar and blood pressure levels have even caused doctors to plan to start weaning him off of his diabetes drugs, and his twice daily blood sugar tests have become only once daily. The exercises raise Mr Hall's heart rate and have reduced his blood sugar and blood pressure levels . Mr Hall said: 'The exercises might only be for 12 minutes but my metabolism keeps working hard for the next 24 hours. 'I noticed an improvement in the first month. 'When I went back to the doctors two weeks ago, they were absolutely astounded. 'They said ‘what on earth have you been doing?' 'I don’t consider myself to be a diabetic any more. 'I feel free to enjoy my life. I can’t believe the difference in myself.' Mr Hall was told he had type 2 diabetes the day after his 60th birthday, after complaining of severe tiredness and thirst and being referred for tests. His declining health culminated with a minor stroke while at work two years ago. 'I felt a strange tingling feeling down my face. 'I felt sort of wobbly, one side of my face started to droop and I couldn’t hold my pen. 'A colleague drove me to my GP and the doctor said you’re not leaving here unless in an ambulance, so I was taken to hospital where I was told I’d suffered a minor stroke, a forewarning to a bigger one.' The minor stroke caused Hall to take retirement, fearing the stress of work was a contributing factor. Mr Hall is on an exercise programme called Progressive Accelerating Cardiopulmonary Exersion, or Pace for short. It is a new programme and has already shown health benefits, such as weight loss and the reversal of type 2 diabetes. It can be achieved by exercising for just 12 minutes two or three times a week. It starts with a brief warm up and then participants begin stretching, running and jumping - all to raise the heart rate quickly. The exercises last for 30 seconds each and are followed by a 90-second recovery. Pace sessions are run by the health and exercise charity More Active Living for Health.","John Hall from Radford, Coventry, suffers from type 2 diabetes .

"By . Mark Duell . A North Sea oil worker attacked his wife and wrecked their home after he returned from a rig to find she had spent all his money having affairs with other men. The 43-year-old man realised his six-year marriage was over when his wife posted a Valentine’s Day picture of herself on Facebook posing in skimpy underwear and the caption ‘Thank you for buying it’. The senior fitter - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - had never seen the garments before and knew the message was intended for another lover, Exeter Crown Court in Devon heard. Sentencing: Exeter Crown Court (pictured) in Devon was told the man left all his £75,000-a-year tax-free salary in the hands of his 33-year-old wife but discovered she had spent it all and run up £30,000 debts in his name . He was such a devoted family man that he refused to join workmates when they went for nights out in Aberdeen because he wanted to save all his money to spend on his four children. He left all his £75,000-a-year tax-free salary in the hands of his 33-year-old wife but discovered she had spent it all and run up £30,000 debts in his name. She even used his personal details to get payday loans with Wonga and spent some of the money going on weekends to London and Paris with other men, the court heard. The man left his wife with serious bruising on the face and body after he confronted her over texts on her phone after returning to his home from a month-long tour of duty in the North Sea. She fled through a window and hid while he wrecked the house, smashing furniture and doors. He admitted causing actual bodily harm but was found not guilty of raping her during the same incident. The man was jailed for three months, suspended for two years, by Judge Phillip Wassall, who told him that the verdict of the jury suggested they did not believe he started the violence. Employment: The man worked at a North Sea oil rig (file picture) but returned to find his wife had spent all his money having affairs with other men . Cash: The wife even used his personal details to get payday loans with Wonga (pictured), the court heard . The rigger told the court his wife’s allegation of rape had wrecked his life. He spent two weeks in custody after his arrest, his house has been repossessed to pay off the debts, and he has no idea where his ex-wife and four children are living because he has not seen them since. 'I saw a message on Facebook on Valentine’s Day of her in underwear which said ""thank you for buying it for me"". I knew I had not bought it. When you are thousands of miles away from anywhere and get a message like that, it plays on your mind' His wife claimed he started having sex with her at the end of an emotional three-hour conversation in which she told him their marriage was over. She said she told him to stop him but he carried on until she managed to push him off her. She said he had seized her phone and kicked and punched her after she grabbed his testicles to make him release it. She said she was kicked and punched on the living room floor and fled through a window before seeking sanctuary at a neighbour’s house. The man said his wife had a string of affairs with other men and ran up debts in his name without his knowledge. He said: ‘I saw a message on Facebook on Valentine’s Day of her in underwear which said ""thank you for buying it for me"". I knew I had not bought it. Trips: She spent some of the money going on weekends to London and Paris with other men, the court heard . ‘When you are thousands of miles away from anywhere and get a message like that, it plays on your mind. I learned she was going up and down to London and over to France. ‘There was only one wage coming in and that was mine. I left all the family finances to her and thought they were good because I had a great job. ‘Then I started getting text messages from Wonga and I found out I had debts of £30,000 and the mortgage was not paid and my house has been repossessed. The mortgage had been increased to £140,000 without my knowing.’ He said during the final encounter his wife had agreed to sex but after 30 seconds had said ‘no, this is wrong’ and he stopped immediately. A friend of his wife told the jury she met her the next day and she said it had ‘been more like an emotional rape’ than anything else. Fellow workers from his rig and the support company in Aberdeen provided references saying he was a reliable and mild mannered supervisor who was so devoted to his family he never joined them in runs ashore.","She posted photo in underwear with caption: 'Thank you for buying it'

"By . Lydia Warren . Raffaele Sollecito has said he has unanswered questions about Amanda Knox's behavior after the murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007. In an interview that aired on Italian television, Sollecito said that Knox left his house the morning before Kercher's body was found and when she returned hours later, she seemed 'very agitated'. She said her front door had been broken into and that she had found spots of blood in the bathroom. 'Certainly I asked her questions,' Sollecito said in the interview, which aired in part on the Today show on Monday. 'Why did you take a shower? Why did she spent so much time there?' The interviewer asked what answers he had to these questions. Scroll down for video . Questions: Raffaele Sollecito said during an interview in Italy, pictured, that he asked Amanda Knox questions after her roommate was murdered - but that he never got answers . Interview: He said he did not know why she took a shower after seeing her house had been broken into . 'I don't have answers,' he responded. NBC legal analyst Lisa Bloom said Sollecito seemed to be distancing himself from Knox - his girlfriend of just a week at the time of the murder - with these latest comments. 'He's saying that there's some evidence that may apply to her that doesn't apply to him,' she said. Sollecito and Knox were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison, respectively, for the murder of Kercher in Perugia and served four years before being released in 2011. Upon her release, Knox went back to her home in Seattle, Washington and when the case went into retrial last year, she refused to return to Italy. Fight: Amanda Knox posted this image - saying 'We are innocent' - to Facebook earlier this month . Speaking out: In interviews since she was reconvicted in January, Knox said she will not return to Italy . On January 30, an Italian . appeals court reconvicted the pair of murdering former roommate Kercher - a ruling the pair are again appealing. 'I am frightened and saddened by this . unjust verdict,' Knox wrote after the ruling. 'Having been found innocent before, I expected better . from the Italian justice system.' Sollecito did appear in court for the appeal and, after they were reconvicted, he was found in a hotel near the Italian border before having his passport revoked. Earlier this month, Knox denied claims that her ex-boyfriend was trying to distance himself from her. The day after the murder: Both Knox's defense team and the attorneys for Sollecito argued that they were in his apartment on the night of Meredith Kercher's murder . Writing on her blog, she said: . 'It has been claimed that, in this most recent round of closing . arguments and in interviews since the latest guilty verdict, Raffaele . and his defense attorneys have finally betrayed their resentment and . started to put distance between him and me legally and personally. Victim: Meredith Kercher was found killed in the apartment she shared with Knox in 2007 . 'This . is not the case. Actually, Attorney Bongiorno’s closing arguments and . Raffaele’s latest statements pinpoint and attack a fundamental weakness . in the prosecution’s case against both Raffaele and me that has been . ignored for far too long: Raffaele is not a slave.' She . added: 'Raffaele has plenty of reason for resentment, but not against . me. The only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens . to be my alibi.' She said Sollecito had recently e-mailed her backing up her stance. She . said he told her: 'I don’t want to be punished for, nor have to . continue to justify, those things that regard you and not me. 'Obviously . the evidence demonstrates both of our innocence, but it seems that for . the judges and the people this objectivity is of no importance.' Of his role in the case, she said: 'He . is collateral damage in the unreasonable, irresponsible and . unrelenting scapegoating of the prosecution’s grotesque caricature that . is ""Foxy Knoxy"".' Knox's blog post came as she released a grim portrait of herself on her Twitter feed that shows her holding up a sign declaring her innocence in Italian. The . 26-year-old is shown in a black-and-white photo, holding a piece of . paper with the words 'SIAMO INNOCENTI' which translates to 'We are . innocent'. See below for video .

"By . Jack Doyle . Growing numbers of cannabis users are needing hospital treatment for ¿mental disorders¿ . Growing numbers of cannabis users are needing hospital treatment for ‘mental disorders’ after smoking super-strength skunk, drugs campaigners warned last night. In just three years, the number admitted for treatment has increased by 50 per cent - as the chemically enhanced danger drug has flooded the streets. Last night drugs campaigners warned young people were severely damaging their mental health, and blamed permissive policing, including the use of cautions and spot fines. Mary Brett, a trustee of Cannabis Skunk Sense said: ‘This worrying trend was entirely predictable, as a growing proportion of the cannabis on sale in Britain is now extremely potent skunk. ‘This rising potency would seem to coincide with the numbers going into hospital, as more children are using this dangerous drug. ‘We need an end to the authorities turning a blind eye to cannabis as if it is a harmless substance, as these figures show it clearly is not.’ Skunk sold on Britain’s streets is mostly grown in this country and is around five times as potent as traditional weed. Recent years have seen its prevalence surge compared to imported cannabis resin. Figures released by the Department of Health show hospital admissions linked to cannabis use have increased by half in three years. In 2008-9 some 651 admissions were recorded by the NHS in England relating to a diagnosis of ‘mental or behavioural disorder due to use of cannabinoids’. By 2011-12, that figure had risen to more than 1000. The figures were released to shadow health minister Diane Abbott in response to a question lodged in Parliament. Last night Miss Abbott said: ‘These figures are really concerning. ‘I think that too often, people are willing to romanticise cannabis. What we’re seeing on our streets is often skunk - many times more powerful than the cannabis which today’s ageing baby-boomers smoked in college.’ ‘The government’s lack of focus and interest in this issue, and the way they have abolished the National Treatment Agency, means that many of these problems may get even worse.’ ‘Evidence of the damage to mental health caused by cannabis use - from loss of concentration to paranoia, aggressiveness and outright psychosis - is mounting and cannot be ignored.’ Skunk sold on Britain¿s streets is mostly grown in this country and is around five times as potent as traditional weed . A 2008 Home Office survey found average concentrations of THC - the active ingredient in cannabis - of 16 per cent. But in some samples the level was much higher - up to 45 per cent. Skunk also contains less of an anti-psychotic ingredient which moderates the harmful effects of THC. Repeated studies have shown the harmful impact on mental health of cannabis use among young people. Research has suggested skunk users under 18 are four times more likely to suffer from schizophrenia in later life, and users under 15 may be ten times more likely than adults to suffer harmful effects. Scientists also found long term use of skunk can lead to ‘significant and irreversible’ fall in a young person’s IQ. Earlier this year, the Mail revealed chief police officers have quietly adopted a new ‘softer’ policy on illegal drug taking. It means a ‘less robust enforcement approach’ on possession of drugs such as cannabis, with more offenders receiving spot fines.","Campaigners warned young people are damaging their mental health .

"By . Patricia Kane . Obese: Liam Johnston pictured last April when he weighed 40 stone. His weight had reached 66 stone . One of Britain’s most obese men - who weighed 66 stone at the age of just 22 - has died of a suspected heart attack. Paramedics rushed to the home of Liam Johnston on Thursday morning but despite their attempts to resuscitate him, he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Two teams of fire officers had to be called in to help medical staff transport the young man’s body, and part of a door and fence panels had to be removed to move him out of the house. The case highlights the appalling toll of obesity in Britain - at a time when record numbers are being diagnosed as overweight. More than a quarter of adults in Britain (26 per cent) are obese, up from just 8 per cent in 1980. In 2007, an alarming government review warned that by 2050, obesity would affect half of all adults and cost the economy £50billion a year. In January a report by the National Obesity Forum said those predictions were ‘optimistic’ and underestimated the ‘true scale of the problem’. Mr Johnston’s weight ballooned from his late teenage years. Having weighed 21 stone by the age of 18 he tipped the scales at more than 40 stone by the age of 21. Staff who carried out a post mortem examination measured his weight at 66 stone - making him one of the heaviest people ever recorded in the UK. Ashamed of his size, Mr Johnston had become a virtual recluse who rarely left his house in Livingston, West Lothian. Last night Mr Johnston’s mother was too upset to discuss her son’s death. In a poignant interview just nine months ago, Mr Johnston spoke about his desperate desire to lose weight before it killed him and how he hoped to be fitted with a gastric band to help him reach his goal. At that point, Mr Johnston, admitted he had been ‘chubby’ as a child but had risen to more than 40 stone and was ashamed of his size. He said: ‘I’m trying to get rid of this weight once and for all. I don’t want to put my family through the ridicule. I’m doing my best to sort my life out.’ He blamed a period where he was unemployed and homeless for exacerbating his weight issues. He added: ‘I’ve hid myself away from the outside world, ashamed at the size I had become. You’ve no idea how difficult it is to go through something like that. To know that no one was there to talk to, for well over a year.’ In the last year, it is estimated his weight had increased steadily to 54 stone, before reaching 66 stone – one of the heaviest measurements for a man ever recorded in the UK. Damage: Emergency services had to remove part of a door and fence panels at Mr Johnston's home, pictured . As a result, the embarrassed young man had become a virtual recluse, seldom seeing anyone but family and rarely leaving his terraced bungalow in the last year. It was there that the ambulance service was called to attend at 7.50am on Thursday and, in turn, sought the assistance of the fire service shortly afterwards. A total of 12 firefighters from the two engines which attended removed the front door and dismantled part of the house wall and garden fence in order to carry him out to the ambulance. Yesterday, evidence of the emergency team’s diligent efforts to remove Mr Johnston’s body from the house were still clearly visible, with components of a bariatric bed and pieces of wood from the door frame littering the garden. Youth: Mr Johnston said he had been a 'chubby' child but his weight ballooned as he grew older . His body was later taken to Edinburgh City Mortuary where a post mortem examination was carried out. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that officers were called to assist the Ambulance and Fire Services at an address in Livingston where a 22-year-old man was taken ill on Thursday morning. ‘A report surrounding the circumstances of his death – which are not being treated as suspicious – will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal at Livingston. His next of kin has been notified.’ People who knew Mr Johnston said he suffered from depression and preferred to lead a sedentary life and play computer games. He was believed to have a Body Mass Indicator (BMI) of well over 85. The BMI for a person of normal weight ranges from 18.5 - 24.9 and anything above 30 is regarded as obese. The gastric band surgery was regarded as a ‘last resort’ and is only available on the NHS to treat people with potentially life-threatening obesity when other treatments, such as lifestyle changes, haven’t worked. The procedure is carried out on around 50 obese patients a year in Scotland. Last summer, Mr Johnston also spoke of his shame after being charged with fraud and being taken to court for using stolen credit card details to order takeaway pizzas. He said: ‘I felt disgusted with myself. I had shamed myself and my family.’ The sheriff, the fiscal and clerk of court had to convene the first hearing in the police cells complex downstairs because Mr Johnston was unable to climb to courtroom on the first floor. He admitted ordering four pizza meals, costing around £30 each, and having them delivered to his then home in Whitburn, West Lothian. After ordering background reports, a sheriff later ordered him to pay compensation totalling £120 to Domino’s Pizza restaurant in Bathgate and produce a receipt. But Mr Johnston failed to turn up for subsequent court hearings over the last year despite warrants being issued for his arrest, claiming he was ‘unfit’ to attend. His lawyer told Livingston Sheriff Court at the time that Mr Johnston was unable to get out of his single storey terraced house. The proceedings against him were still outstanding when he died. Yesterday, at her home in Livingston, his mother, Mary, 41, who also has a daughter, Allana, 20, was too upset to speak of her son’s death.","Liam Johnston had become a virtual recluse at his home in West Lothian .

"By . Ruth Styles . Resplendent in a bright pink striped dress, a fluorescent shell and bead necklace and a gleaming lion skin robe, Meekulu Mwadinohmo looks every inch the Queen. One of the Namibia's last tribal monarchs, Queen Meekulu, leader of the Okwanyama tribe, offered photographer Eric Lafforgue a rare glimpse into her world and allowed him inside the royal palace, which is protected by an elaborate labyrinth. From within her sprawling thatched palace, she rules over the Okwanyama's 55 villages with the help of a council, or board, whose members she chooses herself and can fire at will. Indeed, according to Lafforgue, she did so just before the visit on the grounds that the offending councillor was 'lazy'. Royal: Meekulu Mwadinohmo is the queen of the Okwanyama people of northern Namibia and has reigned since being elected in 2005 . Dynasty: Queen Meekulu has four children and one adopted son, and is the granddaughter of Namibian national hero, King Mandume Ya Ndemufayo . Home: The Queen lives in a royal palace that is surrounded by a labyrinth built from mopane wood and designed to baffle unwanted intruders . Modernising: Queen Meekulu has embraced modernity and dreams of meeting Queen Elizabeth II whom she says could learn much from the tribe . Another duty is managing the 'omaada' or royal . granary which is filled courtesy of a tax levied on subjects that . requires each to turn over part of his or her harvest to the Queen. If . famine strikes, the store opened up to the populace so no one goes . hungry. When not taking care of business at the omaada or tending to her HIV positive adopted son, much of her time is spent touring her kingdom, visiting the sick in hospital and hearing the petitions of village elders from the throne room in the centre of her palace. To get in, visitors must endure an elaborate security process that begins with shouting loudly on approach and involves navigating an intricate labyrinth before submitting to a ceremonial greeting and a lengthy wait in one of the antechambers before being called in to see her. 'Only those who are familiar with the palace know how to get inside,' says Lafforgue. 'It was built to make the invaders lose their way and it's protected by the men who live on the outside. The women live in the middle and the Queen ls in the centre.' Annex: Guests visiting the palace must wait to be greeted in the second antechamber (pictured) before being allowed an audience with Queen Meekulu . Tradition: Like her ancestors, the Queen wears a lion skin robe and sports a delicate shell necklace of the sort also worn by other women in the tribe . Family: 30 people currently live in the palace with Queen Meekulu, among them her adopted HIV positive son who came to live with her last year . Royal . family: The Queen with her four children, adopted son and her horde of . grandchildren - all of whom live with her in the palace . Colourful: . The onyoko necklace is made from seashells and was once a symbol of . wealth. Now easily available, the jewel is now a symbol of womanhood . Home: The royal palace is designed to protect the women and children who live there, so the strongest men are given sleeping places around the outside . Colourful: Queen Meekulu says that the part of Okwanyama tradition she's most keen to preserve is the gorgeous colourful clothes and traditional jewels . Elegant: The Okwanyama are famous for their love of bright colour and print, as well as their traditional onyoka shell beads . Eric travelled with guides from Exotic Travel and Safaris, which offers a 12-day tour that includes a visit to the Queen's lands plus accommodation, meals and transfers, with packages starting at £1,874 per person. For more information, see exotictravelsafaris.com . South African Airways offers return flights to Windhoek from London Heathrow via Johannesburg from £1,010. See flysaa.com for more. For further information on Namibia, please visit namibiatourism.com.na . For more of Eric's work both in Namibia and elsewhere, see ericlafforgue.com. Surrounding the palace is a stockade made from tough mopane wood, which is spiked in a bid to keep both enemies and local elephants at bay. 'By the fence is the olupale where the men gather to tell stories at night while having a few drinks,' explains Lafforgue. 'People put the skulls of the cows killed during the reign of the Queen on the fence. Cows are slaughtered for weddings or funerals, and sometimes to use as a trade for millet if the harvest was bad. When the Queen dies, all of it will be burned.' The Queen, who has ruled the Okwanyama since being elected by a council of elders in 2005, hopes to one day build a museum to house some of the tribe's most important cultural artifacts and to highlight some of her most illustrious ancestors, among them, her grandfather Mandume Ya Ndemufayo. The last king of the Okwanyama, Mandume is a national hero in both Namibia and neighbouring Angola and was killed fighting South African forces as they swept through what was then Deutsch-Südwestafrika [German South-West Africa] in 1917. After Namibia was incorporated into South Africa, many of the tribal royals were banned and Queen Meekulu's family were only reinstated, following much discussion among the elders, after the country gained independence in 1990. Since regaining her throne, Queen Meekulu's mission has been to boost Okwanyama culture and wellbeing of its people, and says there is much that other royals, the UK's own Queen Elizabeth among them, could learn from her tribe and its traditions. 'She dreams of meeting Queen Elizabeth one day and has invited her to visit twice,' explains Lafforgue. Queen Meekulu adds: 'Anyone can enter my palace. The Queen of England should come here to take lessons from our traditions.' Dapper: The women aren't the only ones with a natty sense of style: the men too embrace fashion although they don't always make it as colourful . Stylish: Cowhide sandals are worn by almost everyone and last for years. According to the Okwanyama, if the bottom of your foot itches, someone is coming to visit . Dancing queens: Okwanyama girls clap and laugh as they break into an impromptu dance - much to the delight of everyone watching . Happy: Most Okwanyama live off the land and consider their cows to be their wealth. Most are never killed and are kept solely for milk and barter . Busy: Most of the Okwanyama work in the fields or in their villages. Others help staff the royal palace building the vast elephant-proof mopane wood fences . Lesotho's Letsie III might be the Africa's best known monarch thanks to his vast harem of wives but the priapic king is by no means alone. From Nigeria to Uganda, the continent is awash with royal families, although few enjoy powers comparable to those of Letsie III. Uganda is home to no fewer than five monarchies, among them rulers belonging to the Buganda, Toro and Bunyoro tribes. Most powerful are the 'Kabakas' of the kingdom of Buganda; an area located in and around Ugandan capital Kampala. Currently, the tribe is led by the Cambridge-educated Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi II, who has ruled the kingdom from the imposing Mengo Palace since 1993. Like British royal wives, his spouse, Sylvia Nagginda, the Nnabagereka of Buganda, spends her time working on charitable campaigns and has her own foundation, the Nnabagereka Development Trust Foundation. She is also patron of the Kampala Ballet and Modern Dance School. Other Ugandan royals include Charles Mumbere, Omusinga of the Bakonjo people who inhabit the Rwenzori Mountains, and 18-year-old Rukidi IV of Toro whose mother, the colourful Queen Best, is notorious for her links with former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddaffi. Elsewhere, the Kano people of Nigeria are ruled by Ado Bayero, formerly the Nigerian ambassador to Senegal and the Emir of the Kano People since 1953. While most of his reforms have proved popular, his embrace of education has put him at odds with radical Islamist group Boko Haram, and he narrowly avoided assassination last year following an attack that injured two of his sons and left his driver and bodyguard dead. One of the few remaining monarchies that still rules by decree is that of Sultan Mohammed VI of Morocco, who has enacted a number of far reaching changes to the laws of the country since his accession in 1999. Among them are making the Berber language one of the country's official tongues, guaranteeing social and civic equality for women and handing more power to Morocco's elected parliament - in particular, the Prime Minister who now has the power to dissolve Parliament at will. Delicious: During the rainy season, children make a little extra pocket money by catching frogs, which the tribe then eat boiled and sprinkled with salt . Happy: Under Queen Meekulu, no person will go hungry thanks to the royal granaries which are opened up to the Okwanyama people when famine strikes . Helping out: During harvest, every member of the tribe pitches in to help grind up millet for flour and also to prepare it for storage . Competition: During milling, women will chant ditties about their strength with each encouraging the others in a bid to be seen as the strongest .

"By . Hugo Gye . A mother broke down in court today as she described seeing her four-year-old daughter die in hospital after a doctor failed to administer the treatment she needed to save her life. Carly Wells whispered 'goodbye baby' to her daughter Freya when the girl was being sedated by medics - but it turned out to be the last thing she would ever say to the girl, an inquest heard. Just 25 minutes later, the four-year-old died from septic shock, covered in her own vomit, after a hospital registrar failed to administer intravenous antibiotics quickly enough. West London Coroner's Court heard that registrar Dr Rosita Ibrahim prescribed Freya oral antibiotics even though her junior colleague Hilary Towse and nurses at Kingston Hospital in Surrey disagreed. Grief: Carly Wells, left, has described how she saw her four-year-old daughter Freya, right, die in hospital . Dr Towse told the hearing yesterday that Dr Ibrahim had made her cry by laughing at her suggestion that the girl's condition was more serious than the senior doctor thought. Today the inquest into Freya's death on November 22 2012 was read a statement from Ms Wells, who claimed Dr Ibrahim 'didn't seem concerned' Freya had been vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea for around three days before being admitted to hospital. Freya's mother took her to the her GP twice before taking her to A&E at 9pm on November 21 because she had been ill for five days and wasn't getting any better. 'I was very worried about Freya - it seemed her whole body moved when she took a breath, she would make a grunting noise and was wheezy,' Ms Wells said. 'I took Freya to Kingston Hospital straight away, I was with her the entire time except for less than a minute when she was put to sleep at 5.40am - I don't think I even went to the toilet because I wanted to stay with my little girl the entire time. Freya Wells, 4, died at Kingston Hospital in Surrey (pictured) from a severe infection after doctors failed to give her antibiotics by the correct method, a hearing was told . 'The doctor didn't seemed concerned - at no point until the end did they give the impression that there was something very serious with Freya. They didn't tell me what was wrong or do anything with urgency. 'After an X-ray of her chest a nurse spoke to me and said Freya had a chest infection so would be kept overnight. 'Another doctor, called Dr Ibrahim, came along as well, she didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with Freya either. 'I was worried because she was clearly unwell just to look at her. I remember Freya was given oral antibiotics in A&E and was sick again after taking the medication. My memory is a bit blurred after that - Freya was transferred to the children's ward.' After Freya's grandmother, Shirley Parker, arrived on the ward, Ms Wells contacted her nurse sister as this was the 'main way to get information'. She tried to get her daughter to sleep but she was 'clearly scared and wanted hugs' after vomiting and having diarrhoea in her hospital bed, the inquest heard. West London Coroner's Court heard that in A&E, Registrar Rosita Ibrahim prescribed Freya oral antibiotics, but that her junior colleague and nurses did not agree with that course of treatment . 'Even when we were on the children's ward not a lot seemed to happen', she continued. 'Nothing made me panic until they said they would have to put Freya to sleep. 'As time past Freya seemed to get worse. I felt helpless because my little girl was crying and asking me to make things better. The doctors didn't seem to be doing anything.' The inquest hearing had to be paused today after Ms Wells started weeping while her statement was read to the court. Ms Wells said the first time a doctor told her anything was wrong was when Freya was put to sleep to help her breathe. She added: 'There were lots of people everywhere - wires and tubes were attached to Freya, she was screaming, I had to hold her leg down because there were not enough people to do that. 'I remember kissing Freya saying ""goodbye baby'"". I didn't know it was the last thing I would ever say to her. Dr Rosita Ibrahim, accused of making Freya's mother cry, is seen leaving West London Coroner's Court today . 'When I was told my little girl had died, it felt like my whole world had died as well.' The inquest heard that if septic . shock is diagnosed immediately, there is a 95 per cent chance of . survival, but the initial mortality rate of five per cent doubles each . hour it is not detected and treated. Dr . Marilyn McDougall, a paediatric consultant who conducted an . investigation into Freya's death, told the inquest that by the time . doctors realised what was wrong her chances of survival were 'very, very . slim'. She said: . 'Freya was extremely tachycardic and in respiratory distress, which was . in keeping with the diagnosis of septic shock. If this had been . recognised earlier, her chances of survival would have been greatly . improved. 'Survival for a diagnosis of septic shock is 95 per cent... by 6am, the chances of survival were very, very slim.' The . consultant told the inquest that Dr Ibrahim failed to recognise the . 'severity' of the youngster's condition, saying she would have expected a . 'more comprehensive assessment'. However, . she added that 'it was not obvious she was unwell', saying a 'thorough . examination' is needed to establish a diagnosis of septic shock. The . criminal charges could be brought if West London coroner Dr Sean . Cummings concludes unlawful killing, as the Crown Prosecution Service . would be notified and could prosecute. Richard . Baker, representing Freya's family, said: 'Unlawful killing might be an . appropriate conclusion - that submission is not meant to be scandalous. 'There . was a failure to appreciate the words from other doctors, a failure to . obtain information that would be obtainable and a lack of justification . and observation in this case. 'These features will take you beyond the usual medical failures to gross negligence. 'In . terms of neglect, there was a failure to provide basic medical . attention to a vulnerable person who is in a serious condition. 'Neglect is not negligence - a gross failure is not the same as gross negligence.' However, . Dr Ibrahim's representative Shaheen Rahman, argued against a verdict of . unlawful killing because her client noticed the tragic youngster had an . infection. She said: . 'It is absolutely clear that the approach throughout this inquest hasn't . been founded on suspicion. Nobody has been asked if this was a gross . negligence kind of case. 'This . wasn't a case where there was a failure to see if the patient was . unwell. It was appreciated there was an infection and appreciated it was . pneumonia. Alarm: Junior doctor Hilary Towse repeatedly raised her concerns about the treatment given to Freya . 'Antibiotics were given, fluids, in fact extra fluids, were given.' Cara Guthrie, representing Kingston Hospital NHS Trust, added: 'This is a desperately sad case and the Trust accepts the standard of care for Freya fell far short of what she should have had. 'To return a verdict of unlawful killing, you would have to be satisfied to the criminal standard and be sure beyond reasonable doubt. 'The Trust has taken extensive steps to learn from Freya's death and other steps to ensure no other child dies at Kingston Hospital in similar circumstances.' The inquest also heard evidence from Dr Titilola Ayeni, who cried as she told the coroner she could not understand why hospital staff took so long to call her. The consultant, who was finally called to examine Freya at 5am on November 22, 2012, said Freya was 'clearly, very ill' when she came to examine her and that despite her being by far the sickest patient on the ward that night, staff showed little urgency when briefing her. 'It's not a situation I've ever experienced before"", she explained, ""it wasn't complicated in my opinion, it was very simple, very basic. 'There was no urgency, no recognition that the situation was an emergency - it is what I call a meandering discussion. 'I thought calling the consultant was very appropriate because the child was so unwell. 'She had been the most ill patient on the ward so she should have been in the High Dependency Unit so we could have observed her more closely.' The coroner is expected to deliver his verdict on Monday. The inquest continues.","Carly Wells took daughter Freya to A&E after she was ill for several days .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A beautiful hairdresser has won a two-week honeymoon in Greece after she and her slightly less picturesque fiance won a competition to find the most unlikely couple. Hairdresser Kate Cathcart, 24, and sales adviser Darren Donaghey, 29, from Newcastle, took first prize in a local radio's Punching Above Your Weight competition after listeners voted them the most mismatched in the looks department. Miss Cathcart was described by Metro Radio's Steve Furnell as: 'A beautiful blonde with gorgeous teeth, lovely smile, great eyes and a fantastic figure'. Meanwhile, she described her beau as 'No Tom Cruise', adding: 'We can always edit the wedding photos.' Scroll down for video . Perfectly suited: Kate Cathcart, 24, and Darren Donaghey, 29, were voted most unlikely-looking couple . The couple, who have been together for eight years and have a two-year-old son, Jaxon, admit they regularly receive surprised looks when they are out together. But despite being in different leagues aesthetically, they are adamant that they are perfectly suited. Mr Donaghey entered the competition, uploading a picture of the pair of them to the radio's website, after hearing about the competition while driving to work. He said: 'Before even asking Kate, I'd uploaded a photo of us together. 'For years I've had stick about how I managed to woo Kate and it's not unusual to be out together and other guys to innocently start chatting Kate up, thinking that I couldn't possibly be with her. 'Even when we are out shopping at Asda I get these funny looks from blokes and I know what they are thinking.  Having put up with this for years I knew we had a decent chance of winning.' He added: 'Some of the other blokes in the final were pretty horrid, so at least now I know how I measure up.' Happy family: The Newcastle couple, who are getting married in August, have a two-year-old son, Jaxon . The couple have been together for eight years and Mr Donaghey says he's used to getting odd looks from men . The couple met when Miss Cathcart moved into Mr Donaghey's Newcastle street. He was describing his attractive new neighbour to a friend in the pub, and the friend said: 'That's my sister.' When . asked what attracted her to Mr Donaghey, Miss Cathcart said: 'I don't . know, really, but I did think there was something there, otherwise I . probably wouldn't have gone there.' She said: 'I mistook him for his cousin when I first met him so I felt a bit bad and thought I’d better give him a chance. 'We’re still here eight years later, even if he does look a bit like Rodney off Only Fools and Horses. The couple met after Miss Cathcart moved into Mr Donaghey's street and he set about trying to meet her . 'I love Darren dearly and looks aren't everything.  He may not be Tom Cruise, but looks fade, and personality stays for ever.' Meanwhile her boyfriend is under no illusions. He said that while she had no bad habits he could think of, 'She’s like one of the boys. 'She burps and trumpets all the time.  She’s got no decorum, as her mam would say, but that’s what I love about her: ' The pair are getting married this August at Matfen Hall in Northumberland, and will now use their holiday prize as their honeymoon.","Kate Cathcart, 24, and Darren Donaghey, 29, have been together for years .

"By . Sam Webb . Social worker Claire Selwood sued because Burton had warned that he wanted to kill her two days before his discharge from Sunderland's Cherry Knowle Hospital . A social worker who nearly bled to death after being stabbed six times by a patient has finally won a seven year battle for compensation. Mother-of-three Claire Selwood was stabbed by Graham Burton, 45, at a school in County Durham in 2006. The kitchen knife used by Burton was left stuck in the social worker’s back after the attack and Ms Selwood lost five pints of blood. Burton was later jailed indefinitely after admitting attempted murder. Ms Selwood sued and the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust and Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, because Burton had warned that he wanted to kill her two days before his discharge from Sunderland’s Cherry Knowle Hospital - but the threat was never passed on to her. She also sued her employer, Durham County Council, but the claim was unsuccessful. Newcastle County Court initially dismissed the case against the trusts on the grounds they did not owe Ms Selwood a duty of care. But the ruling was overturned by the Court of Appeal in London and Ms Selwood has since suffered a lengthy battle to win her case. It accepted it was arguable that the trusts owed her a duty of care based on their responsibilities under an agreed protocol. Ms Selwood, who now lives in Morpeth, Northumberland, settled out of court with the NHS trusts, which have agreed to pay her what is understood to be a six-figure sum. Despite his chilling promise to attack the mother-of-three, Burton was signed out of the hospital and set free to carry out his threat. Just hours after his release on Burton turned up at a school in County Durham and attacked Miss Selwood, 36, as she prepared for a morning meeting. Attacker: Graham Burton, 45, stabbed mother-of-three Claire Selwood at a school in County Durham in 2006 . The mother-of-three said she was given very little help by her employers . Miss Selwood described how she had been dealing with a difficult case as a social worker involving Burton. She . said: 'Graham had been a very odd character but it wasn't an unusual . thing to come across in my line of work. On the day of the attack I... walked in surprised to see him knowing that he had been put in hospital. 'There . had been no communication to say that he had been released from . hospital. Had I known that he had made threats against my life I would . have been able to assess the situation and distance myself from the . whole thing for my own safety. 'Finding . out he had said that he wanted to kill me on the spot was a shock. I . was annoyed that this hadn't been communicated to me when he had said it . to two different people. 'I was aware he disliked me but not that he wanted to kill me.' Claire described the day of the attack as very surreal and still, to this day, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder because of it as well as other disabilities which affect her mobility. She now has scars covering her torso, back and forearm from that day and is thankful to even be alive as if the knife had been a few millimetres lower it would have hit her heart and she would have bled to death. She said: 'I had simply gone in for what I thought was a normal meeting and was shocked to see him there but figured he must have just been discharged from hospital. 'When I went into the meeting room with another member of staff I didn't actually realise he had stabbed me until my leg have way and I saw blood on the floor. 'My colleague hadn't even noticed and says that it all happened so fast she didn't register what was going on.' Scars: The horrific injuries Miss Selwood sustained in the attack . She added: 'I remember asking the nurse in the hospital if I was going to die and she said no but I guess they're meant to say that. 'I don't remember much of the actual attack but when police were called Graham apparently walked outside and calmly handed himself in.' Miss Selwood still has to deal with the effects of the attack on a daily basis. She is unable to walk very far and has recently got herself a mobility scooter to help. She cannot cope well in big crowds and will always assess any situation just before leaving the house. Her three sons, Flynn, 18, Conor, 17, and Lucas, nine, were all young at the time of the attack and have also been severely distressed and traumatised from the attack on their mother. Miss Selwood said she was given very little help by her employers, particularly Durham County Council, which she claims ‘washed its hands’ of her after she moved jobs.

She now has scars covering her torso, back and forearm from that day and is thankful to even be alive . She said: 'You’re treated like cannon fodder - you’re facing verbal assaults and physical threats and there’s no back-up from the local authority. 'Social workers are getting back to their own kids at 7pm or 8pm completely exhausted and there’s no support for them. 'The usual result is social workers end up going off on sick leave, and then moving jobs. This means that good workers are not retained by the authority. 'However, it also means that the authority drain the last hours of life out of their workers, and do absolutely nothing to counteract the effect on them and their families of doing this dangerous job.' Durham County Council did not wish to comment. Miss Selwood, pictured before the knife attack . Newcastle County Court initially dismissed the case against the trusts on the grounds they did not owe Ms Selwood a duty of care . Commenting on the settlement, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust and Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are pleased for Ms Selwood that her claim has now been resolved. 'Mental health services have changed considerably since this appalling attack. Both organisations have made improvements to the way they work and acted promptly to implement the recommendations of an independent investigation into the incident in 2010. 'Both trusts offer their best wishes to Ms Selwood and her family for the future.'","Graham Burton knifed Claire Selwood at a County Durham school in 2006 .

"By . Martin Robinson . With their rich and vibrant colours and bold landscapes, these dramatic artworks would not look out of place on sale in any top gallery. But what makes them even more extraordinary is that the artist began painting as a toddler, had his first exhibition at five and has now earned his first paid commission at 11. Prodigy Matthew Johnson is the fourth generation of painter in his family and learned to hold a brush before he could use a pen. The schoolboy, from Spennymoor, County Durham, is now being paid by a collector to create a new unique piece for their home. Star in the making: 11-year-old Matthew Johnson has picked up his first paid commission after his work was seen by collectors . 'It feels amazing. In one sense it's just like doing another painting but I realise it's a commission because someone really likes my work and trust me to magic up another,' he said. The youngster concentrates on creating abstract landscapes, which he textures using a layering technique. He takes his inspiration from a rich artistic background, but also through his love for video games. 'I love to capture the rich skies and landscapes you see in video games,' he said. 'You can really make paintings come to life using deep colours to sense the mood and tone of each setting.' Magical: Matthew enjoys painting landscapes, especially in his native north-east, shown here in his piece 'Great day for sailing' Moody: This abstract painting, called 'Elemental', is a good example of his work as it shows his love of colour and texture . Talented:  Matthew's work, like 'Twilight Highlands', left, and 'Sun Dance', right, has led to interest from collectors . Matthew is the same age as Kieron Williamson, known as the ‘Mini Monet’, who has gained international renown and earned £1.5million since he began painting landscapes on a family holiday five years ago. Matthew's mother Lynn Rocks, his grandfather Colin Richardson and his older twin brothers, Chris and Steve Rocks, are all professional artists. Proud:  Matthew's mother Lynn Rocks says he and all the family are 'chuffed' about his early success . Ms Rocks, 52, said: 'Matthew and his brothers were always painting. We are an arty family so all of the materials were at hand for him to use. 'He would always take his top off while painting, which became a bit of a routine whether he was in our studio or outside. We were worried he would go to school and do the same! 'He's a very talented individual and he amazes me at how vast his imagination is. He gets worried that he's not good at Maths, but he is so creative, and I have no doubt that's what his future holds for him.' Matthew was hired to take on his latest challenge by a couple who want him to create a painting for the living room of their newly renovated family home. The piece will form the focal piece of the room, and will no doubt attract great interest from those who see it. The 11-year-old said: 'For them to put such confidence in me for something that will be such a big part of their home feels really special. 'My family have been such role models, and I'm really pleased to be learning fro them. 'When I was about seven, I saw my mam counting out loads of money after selling a painting and I thought, that job sounds good to me. 'I don't know yet if I will do this as a career, but it would be great to do something I enjoy.' A millionaire: 'Mini Monet' Kieron Williamson, 11, has seen his lifetime earnings approach £1.5million . Advanced: Kieron is considered to be well beyond his years in his level of talent and has stunned art lovers the world over . Multi-talented Matthew doesn't just stop at painting - he also plays the ukulele, break dances, performs card tricks and acts. His mother added: 'We are all immensely proud of him and he's so chuffed to be given this opportunity.'","Matthew Johnson learned to hold a paintbrush before he could use a pen .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Harvard scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in discovering why neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's affect certain people in old age while others can live to 100 and not develop dementia. The research, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, focused on a protein previously thought to act mostly in the brains of developing fetuses. The scientists found that the protein, called REST, also appeared to protect neurons in healthy older people from aging-related stresses. Harvard scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in discovering why neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's affect certain people in old age while others can live to 100 and not develop dementia (stock photo) But in people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, the protein was sharply depleted in key brain regions. ‘Our work raises the possibility that the abnormal protein aggregates associated with Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases may not be sufficient to cause dementia; you may also need a failure of the brain's stress response system,’ said Bruce Yankner, Harvard Medical School professor of genetics and leader of the study. ‘If true, this opens up a new area in terms of treatment possibilities for the more than five million Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease,’ said Yankner, who in the 1990s was the first to demonstrate the toxic effects of amyloid beta, the hallmark abnormal protein in Alzheimer's. The research underscores a different way of looking at neurodegenerative diseases. Brain effect: This computer graphic shows a slice of the brain of an Alzheimer patient (left) compared with a normal brain (right). The Alzheimer's brain is considerably shrunken . Instead of focusing on the negative changes that cause disease, researchers examined trouble spots in the brain's ability to protect itself over time. Yankner said the study suggests a person may be able to resist the toxic effects of Alzheimer's if REST levels remain high. ‘If we could activate this stress-resistance gene network with drugs, it might be possible to intervene in the disease quite early,’ he said. But they cautioned that much more needed to be determined, including whether the decline of REST was a cause, or an effect, of brain deterioration, and whether it was specific enough to neurological diseases that it could lead to effective therapies. He also has thoughts about a potential treatment, lithium, which he said appears to stimulate REST function, and is considered relatively safe. As dementia rates rise, researchers believe preventive studies such as this will be critical in finding a cure. Some estimates say the number of people living with dementia will double to nearly 70 million by 2030. 'This is an extremely important study,' said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary accompanying the study. 'This is the first study that is really starting to provide a plausible pathway to explain why some people are more vulnerable to Alzheimer’s than other people.'","Harvard scientists believe they may have made a breakthrough in treating people suffering from dementia .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . For 68-year-old Jim Geiger, age is not a barrier to conquering the world's highest mountain. The great-grandfather is on his way to Mount Everest in a bid to become the oldest American to summit the Himalayan peak. 'At 68, I’m in the best shape of my life,' the California resident, who has climbed some of the world’s tallest mountains, told The Sacramento Bee. Scroll down for video . Ambitious: Experienced climber Jim Geiger, 68 (believed to be pictured in Antarctica in 2013) is headed for Mount Everest in a bid to become the oldest American to summit the Himalayan peak . Experienced climber: Jim Geiger (pictured left and right) is an ex-Marine who has summited several mountains . Geiger, who left his Sacramento home on Saturday, is scheduled to arrive in Nepal today, where he will meet with International Mountain Guides representatives and elite mountaineering Sherpas. The ex-Marine aims to reach Everest base camp on April 6, and, if everything goes as planned, he will summit the mountain by May 11. The experienced climber said he's motivated by his deep love for his family and the need to prove that you can still be vibrant as you age. 'Age is just a number,' Geiger said, according to a video posted on his YouTube page. 'My kids and grandkids are the most important thing in my life and I am living my life so that they can see that I am there for them and can be there for them for a long time. 'There's no need to feel that, as you get older, that you need to be decrepit and can't do things. Baloney! You can.' Support network: Jim Geiger (center) said he is inspired by the love of his family, who helped him celebrate his 68th birthday . The current American record holder is Californian lawyer Bill Burke, who successfully climbed Everest in 2009 at age 67. The oldest man to climb Mount Everest is Yuichiro Miura of . Japan, who reached the summit aged 80 in May last year, according to Guinness . World Records. While Geiger acknowledged the dangers of the climb, he said he wasn't worried. He has climbed mountains such . as Alaska's Denalli, Nevada's Boundary Peak and Colorado's Mt. Elbert. His previous . highest climb has been 22,841 feet, to the top of Aconcagua in . Argentina. Enormous: Standing at an epic 29,029-feet-tall, Mount Everest is the world's highest mountain . Record holders: In 2009, Bill Burke (left) became the oldest American to scale Everest aged 76, while Japan's Yuichiro Miura (right) was 80 when he conquered the mountain last year . To prepare for Mount Everest, . Geiger’s training has included hauling a 65-pound backpack up hills. He also trained on Pyramid Peak in . Desolation Wilderness between Pollock Pines and South Lake Tahoe, which has an elevation of 9,987 feet. 'I . probably have climbed that thing at least 80 times over the last 28 . years,' he told the Sacramento Bee. 'It is my favorite because it is a quick four miles up and . 4,000-feet of elevation gain.' At the Everest base camp, which has an elevation of 17,590 feet, Geiger said he will try to get acclimated to the thin air over a month before his summit attempt. Challenging: Jim Geiger has prepared for the difficult climb by hauling a 65-pound backpack up hills . Past achievements: Jim Geiger has already conquered Boundary Peak in Nevada (left) and Mt.

"By . James Rush . A primary school named in honour of a Second World War hero who was killed in action is facing criticism after changing its name to shake off its 'association with failure'. John Baskeyfield VC Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was placed in special measures in 2012 and then removed after becoming an Academy earlier this year. As a result trustees decided earlier this month to rename it Saint Nathaniel’s Academy because they believed its previous name was associated with its own ‘legacy of failure’ But angry parents, historians and relatives of the gallant soldier - who sacrificed his life for his country 70 years ago at the age of just 21 - have hit out at the move and branded it an insult to his memory. A primary school named in honour of Second World War hero John Baskeyfield (pictured) has been criticised after changing its name. Mr Baskeyfield was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in the Battle of Arnhem . Joyce Windsor, the niece of John Baskeyfield, is worried 'everybody will forget' about her war hero uncle . John Baskeyfield was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously in November 1944 for bravery during the Battle of Arnhem just months earlier in September 1944. He died while single-handedly fighting off Nazi tanks after the rest of his regiment had been killed. Baskeyfield fought with the 2nd South Staffs Regiment in North Africa, Sicily and Italy and commanded two anti-tank guns at Arnhem. Having . come under heavy fire from the Germans most of the regiment were forced . back but Baskeyfield’s section dug themselves in and fought. All his fellow soldiers were killed leaving Baskeyfield to man two anti tank guns to hold off the advancing Germans. Despite . his actions, by the time the Nazis sent a third wave of troops a German . tank destroyed his position with a single shot tragically killing him . in the process. John Baskeyfield VC CE Primary School, in Stoke, has now changed its name to Saint Nathaniel's Academy . Trustees at the school have said they decided on the rebrand because they believed the school's name was associated with 'a legacy of failure' The young . soldier’s body was never recovered but he was awarded the Victoria Cross a few months after his death and a statue put up in his honour in Stoke-on-Trent . in 1990. His niece Joyce . Windsor, 65, from Bradwell, today said: 'Nobody will remember him, . everybody will forget and it will get pushed under the carpet. It’s a . shame.' She said: 'It was all done in his memory and now that has gone so it is really disappointing.  It is heartbreaking really when you think about it and we had no warning at all. I was quite taken aback. 'He was my father's younger brother and there were two sisters and another brother in total. 'I learnt a lot about him through the family so although I never met him I felt I knew a bit about him. Baskeyfield's niece Joyce Windsor today said: 'Young people need genuine heroes to look up to and my uncle was the ideal role model' 'It just made you proud to think of what he had done and it was nice to know he is recognised. 'It . is a real shame the school has changed because now he will go from . peoples' minds and people will just forget what John did. No one will know in a few years' time and that is a great tragedy. 'Young people need genuine heroes to look up to and my uncle was the ideal role model.' Distant . relative Christine Tilsley, 65, added: 'We have not got many heroes and . it is good for children to have a sense of history. 'I was very proud of having a John Baskeyfield VC school. This decision is very silly and short-sighted. 'Instead . of being associated with a VC winner, those children will grow up . associated with a saint I have certainly never heard of - and I read the . Bible.' The young soldier's body was never recovered but he was awarded the Victoria Cross a few months after his death and a statue put up in his honour in Stoke-on-Trent in 1990 . The school has now officially adopted the new name after being awarded academy status on March 1. Defending . the decision executive principal Chris Brislen said: 'The trust is . confident the school is moving from strength to strength. 'We have come out of special measures by becoming an academy but the school has a way to go. 'To continue with the John Baskeyfield name would have continued with that legacy of failure. 'To have that legacy of failure associated with a local Victoria Cross winner wasn’t particularly good for him either. 'They have thrown away the memory of a local war hero. The new name means nothing to the children' - Diana Coia, who has two grandchildren at the school . 'We are a church school and the name reflects that ethos. We are in partnership with Belgrave St Bartholomew’s Academy. 'St . Bartholomew is the name of one of Jesus’ disciples and Nathaniel is the . name given to Bartholomew in John’s gospel so we thought it was a good . name.' Mr Brislen added the . decision had also been made because some people thought the VC - which . stood for Victoria Cross - meant ‘voluntary controlled’ instead. But parent Rachael Meaney, 33, from . Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'The kids all knew about John Baskeyfield and what . he did for this country. He is Stoke’s proudest son. 'In . such a poignant year 70 years since D-Day the children should be . learning about that - not a saint that nobody has heard of. 'I’ve spoke to many parents and nobody really knows who Saint Nathaniel is. 'It . is a disgrace to the memory of one of the city’s finest war heroes that . he has his name and his legacy stripped away from the school. Troops under fire at the Battle of Arnhem on the Dutch/German border in September 1944 . 'It’s callous and cold-hearted and his family must be devastated. John Baskeyfield would be turning in his grave. 'How on earth can you associate the name of a Second World War hero with failure? They have lost their marbles.' Diana . Coia, 50, who has two grandchildren at the school, said: 'They have . thrown away the memory of a local war hero. The new name means nothing . to the children. 'They need to change the standards not the name.' The school was named after the lance . sergeant who was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously in November 1944 for bravery . during the Battle of Arnhem in September of the same year. After . initially becoming a butcher Baskeyfield was called up to the army in . 1942, joining the South Staffordshire Regiment and serving with the 2nd . Battalion's anti-tank platoon. The school's executive principal Chris Brislen said: 'To continue with the John Baskeyfield name would have continued with that legacy of failure' He served in North Africa, Sicily and Italy before fighting in the Battle of Arnhem. He . was involved in the fierce confrontation near Oosterbeek, Holland, in . September 1944, which saw most of the regiment being forced back. Baskeyfield's section then mounted a serious defence of their positions, digging in near a road junction. His companions were all killed, while he was also badly injured in the leg. This . however did not prevent him from bravely holding off the entire German . troop single-handedly, in the hope of being able to attract the . attention of nearby Allied soldiers. 'We have come out of special measures by becoming an academy but the school has a way to go. To continue with the John Baskeyfield name would have continued with that legacy of failure' - Executive principal Chris Brislen . The Germans renewed their onslaught and continued to attack the position held by Baskeyfield alone, as no help arrived. He destroyed two armoured cars before a German tank destroyed his position in a single shot.He was killed in the process. The Battle of Arnhem was part of Operation Market Garden, a bid by Allied forces to break through German lines and take bridges in occupied Holland.The operation itself was turned into a 1977 epic war film, called A Bridge Too Far, based on the book by Corenlius Ryan, starring Dirk Bogarde, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Laurence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins. Local . historian Fred Hughes said: 'I was very pleased when the school adopted . the name of John Baskeyfield VC, it recognised and acknowledged as a . tribute to the amazing story of a local hero. 'It is a pity that they feel the need now to drop that name.' St Nathaniel’s Academy is a mixed school and has 420 pupils aged from three to 11. Ofsted’s inspection in November last year revealed the school’s progress since being placed in special measures was inadequate and progress since the previous monitoring inspection was satisfactory. Stoke-on-Trent City Council said the school was opened in 2001 as the 'John Baskeyfield VC Primary School'. The Battle of Arnhem was known at the time as Operation Market Garden. It was one of the boldest plans of World War Two and, if it had succeeded, would have ensured the war ended by Christmas 1944. A total of 30,000 British and American airborne troops were to be flown behind enemy lines in September 1944 to capture the eight bridges that spanned the Dutch German border. British tanks and infantry were to meet the airborne troops at the bridges and cross them. The Battle of Arnhem was one of the boldest plans of World War Two and, if it had succeeded, would have ensured the war ended by Christmas 1944 . The plan was conceived after the D-Day landings in June 1944 by General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the British forces in Europe. Over three days, the Allied airborne forces tried to parachute in, while tanks and infantry made their way to the bridges. They were surrounded by German troops and were eventually forced to fight their way out. Almost 2,000 British soldiers were killed and 6,854 captured - a disastrous defeat for the Allied Forces. German artillery controlled the river and only 2,500 British soldiers made it out alive. It would be another four months before the Allies crossed the Rhine again in early 1945. The war dragged on for another seven months until September 1945.","John Baskeyfield VC Primary School renamed Saint Nathaniel's Academy .

"By . Martin Robinson . Retailers are being warned to lock their bins after growing gangs of scavengers have been caught rooting through rubbish to grab discarded items they can sell or eat. Groups have been secretly filmed rifling through refuse in Gloucester for the last two months, stealing furniture, clothes and food on a weekly basis. Footage shows how they take it in turns to go through industrial dustbins for anything of worth and in the last few weeks have salvaged food scraps, computer monitors, and even a video player. But they have been warned they could face up to seven years in prison for theft if they are caught in the act. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught in the act: This couple appear to raid items from bins in Gloucester and load it on to their mobility stroller . Help yourself! This man was filmed puling this basket of items from the dustbin, which also contained a computer monitor . Wide view: Two groups tackle separate bins in the centre of Gloucester, not knowing they were being watched from above . Richard Cook, 54, is among them, and said: 'There seems to be a lot in the charity shop bins. I come because I may find something special. 'The best things I have found include an Alice in Wonderland book, a dish and a clock radio. It was a lovely clock and the figures on it were in tact so I took that home with me. 'Gloucester is the best place to go looking. I have been to Chelsea, Soho and Cheltenham. Gloucester is the best. 'I am currently looking for a shelf and a pair of tights but they are not easy to find.' Scavenger: Richard Cook says that he has taken from bins all over the country but maintains that the ones in Gloucester are the best . Sharing the spoils: This trio look at the items taken from this bin, hidden under cardboard boxes . Scavenging: This man brought his bike to rummage for rubbish and then appeared to pull out clothing . Spoils: People taking items have admitted to carrying off furniture, household goods and even food - nut they have been warned it is theft . Mr Cook is one of eight people who regularly scout out bins which belong to the Salvation Army and PDSA, as well as Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Sports Direct and a council-run arts venue. Foodbank bosses said they not surprised people have taken to raiding bins in recent months and have seen a sharp rise in the number of people needing handouts. Anneliese Sterry, from Gloucester Foodbank, said: 'This is not a surprise to us at all. It is not uncommon for this to happen. 'We have people coming to use who have not eaten for days. We have just one where a mother came in with her eight year old. She was complaining of pains because she hadn't eaten anything.' A Gloucester City Council spokeswoman advised firms to lock their bins to thwart raiders. She added: 'The city council would advise businesses who have any issues with people accessing their bins to speak with their trade waste carrier to have the bins locked. 'It is the responsibility of each of us to deal with our waste responsibly.' Hard work: This man was caught on camera looking in this fallen dustbin and the one next to it, behind some charity shops . Return: The same man returned with an accomplice on a similar occasion to save items from landfill . Charity shops were quick to defend the way they handle their waste. James Preece, area retail manager for YMCA, said: 'The bins in the photographs do not belong to our YMCA shop. We keep our bins securely locked up during the week and they are only put out on collection days.' A spokeswoman for animal charity PDSA said they only placed their rubbish in bags on collection day and added: 'Any donations we receive that aren't saleable are ragged or recycled to raise funds for the charity.' Theft from private property can lead to a maximum jail sentence of seven years but police in Gloucester said they do not recall making an arrests recently.","Retailers in Gloucester warned to lock bins after gangs target their rubbish .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Not everyone would want to come across praying mantises, which are known for their cannibalistic tendencies, in the woods. But one biologist has identified 19 new species of a tree-living praying mantis family in forests around the world, tripling the group's diversity at a stroke. The bark mantises (Liturgusa Saussure) from Central and South America were found in tropical forests and among specimens kept in museums - and one of them has been named after former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore. One biologist has identified 19 new species of a tree-living praying mantis family in tropical forests as well as in museums, tripling the group's diversity at a stroke. Liturgusa krattorum, one of the new species found in a dense Amazonian rain forest is pictured . Nineteen new species of the bark mantis family were found in tropical rainforests in Central and South America as well as in museum collections. Bark mantises are fast runners that live on the trunks and branches of trees. They are active hunters and pursue their prey, unlike some other mantis species that prefer to lie in wait and ambush other insects. Bark mantises are not thought to engage in cannibalism. They are highly camouflaged and evade predators by running to the opposite side of their tree - a tactic also adopted by many tree-dwelling lizards. This shows they constantly monitor their environment and take action accordingly. Some species leap off a tree trunk to avoid capture and even play dead. One of the newly-discovered species is called Liturgusa krattorum and another, Liturgusa algorei, which was captured in a dense rain forest along the Amazon River in northern Peru, is named after former US Vice-President Al Gore. Many of the newly described species are known only from a few specimens collected before 1950 from locations that have been destroyed or irrevocably changed by agriculture or urban development. ‘Based on this study, we can predict that mantis groups with similar habitat specialisation in Africa, Asia and Australia will also be far more diverse than what is currently known’ said Dr Gavin Svenson, curator of invertebrate zoology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in the U.S. ‘Many of these groups have never been studied other than by the scientists that originally described some of the species, which in some cases is more than 100 years ago. ‘This is exciting because enormous potential exists for advancing our understanding of praying mantis diversity just by looking within our existing museum collections and conducting a few field expeditions,’ he explained. Dr Svenson searched for the insects in eight countries in Central and South America and studied hundreds of specimens from 25 museums in North America, South America and Europe to make the finds. Liturgusa algorei, a new species of praying mantis named after former US Vice-President Al Gore, was captured in a dense rain forest along the Amazon River in northern Peru, but other specimens were identified among museum collections collected over a century ago . Many of the newly described species are known only from a few specimens collected before 1950 from locations that have been destroyed or irrevocably changed by agriculture or urban development. One of the species has been named after Nobel laureate Al Gore (pictured), who is a prominent climate change activist . Bark mantises are fast runners that live on the trunks and branches of trees. Contrary to the common perception of mantises being slow, methodical ambush experts, the insects are active hunters that pursue their prey. Also unlike some other mantis species, they are not believed to engage in cannibalism.They are highly camouflaged and evade predators by running to the opposite side of their tree - a tactic also adopted by many tree-dwelling lizards. ‘This is an amazing behaviour for an insect because it shows that they are not only relying on camouflage like most insects but are constantly monitoring their environment and taking action to run and hide,’ said Dr Svenson. ‘In addition, some species leap off the tree trunk to avoid capture and play dead after fluttering down to the forest floor since none of the species are strong fliers,’ he said. The new species are described in the latest edition of the online open access journal Zookeys.","The bark mantises from Central and South America were found in tropical forests and among specimens kept in museums .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It's the deadliest form of skin cancer, claiming 9,500 Americans each year, with the average life expectancy after diagnosis a matter of months. But now a new experimental drug is providing hope for patients with advanced melanoma by changing the course of treatment. Called nivolumab, esearchers say the drug uses the body’s immune system to target and fight cancer cells and has helped some patients with advanced melanoma keep their cancer in check over a period of many year, according to ABC News. Some even saw a reduction in their tumor masses during the clinical trial. However, while it is hoped the drug becomes available in about 18 months, it will come at a huge price, with rumored price tags of about $40,000 per patient per month. A new experimental drug called nivolumab is providing new hope to patients who have been diagnosed with advanced melanoma . Patients diagnosed with melanoma that have been trialling the drug survived for an average 16.8 months following initiation of treatment . Melanoma is difficult to fight because it can turn off the body¿s ability to naturally attack the cancerous cells . Melanoma is hard to fight because it can turn off the body’s ability to attack the cancerous cells. These new drugs keep your immune cells active, so as the tumor adds new cells, the immune system is able to remove them. The drugs are classified as immunotherapy. Patients who showed responses to the drug survived for an average 16.8 months following initiation of treatment. Overall, 62 percent of patients were alive one year following treatment initiation, and 43 percent were alive two years later. Average survival among 33 patients whose tumors shrank significantly was two years. The drug is now being tested in three larger, phase III trials in melanoma, which generally compare a new therapy with a standard one currently in use. Results of the study were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Melanoma is particularly common among Caucasians, especially northern Europeans and northwestern Europeans living in sunny climates . Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing moles or, in the case of nodular melanoma, the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin . 'The results seen here are remarkable for these patients with treatment-resistant, advanced metastatic melanoma, who had limited life expectancies when they joined the trial,' says study lead-author Suzanne Topalian, M.D., professor of surgery and oncology, and director of the melanoma program at Johns Hopkins. While clinical trials have been promising, researchers point out that the drugs are not a cure. Doctors still maintain that the best course of action is catching melanoma early. Always check your skin for any new spots, or moles that look different or change color. Anything larger than a pencil eraser should be properly checked by a doctor.","Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and kills 9,500 Americans each year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . From Batman to Shrek and even Superman, films have become an increasingly popular source of inspiration for brides in search of an unusual wedding theme. But one Harry Potter aficionado has taken things a step further, combining an homage to the boy wizard with a play on Star Wars - her groom's film of choice. As a result, invitations to the wedding enjoyed by Victoria Maclean-Price and her new husband, Adam Maclean, both 34, last weekend came in the shape of Hogwarts' acceptance letters while the cake was decorated with an AT-AT walker. Magical: Harry Potter fan Victoria Maclean-Price with the papier mâché pensieve created for her wedding . Many of the decorations were handmade and thanks to the quality of her magical handiwork, newlywed Victoria, from Tonna in South Wales, has been offered the chance to turn her hobby into a business. Speaking about her unusual wedding, Mrs Maclean-Price said: 'While planning the wedding with one of my bridesmaids, she told me to make sure that we put our own personal stamp on our wedding day. 'I am the Harry Potter fan and Adam is the Star Wars fan, so what better way to make it our day, then to have these two films as the theme for our big day. It was the most perfect combination: the best of both worlds.' According to Mrs Maclean-Price, the unusual choice of theme came about after she fell in love with the Harry Potter books. Creative: The pair, pictured right with their children, used a replica of Godric Gryffindor's sword to cut their cake . Clever: Victoria with one of the Potter themed papier mâché props created for the wedding . 'I love that Harry never gave up no matter how much he lost,' she said. 'I love that he was a fighter, and cared about all his friends like family. Everything he does he does as a fighter.' So devoted to Potter is Mrs Maclean-Price, she even named her four-year-old son Harry after the boy wizard and involved him in creating props for the wedding, among them, a pensieve. 'My little boy Harry helped me make the bowl. He sat there and made the papier-mâché. I just love doing it. 'I used to make jewellery years ago, but it was not challenging enough for me. I love making things that people say ""you can't make that"". I like to go against what people say.' After spending months creating a variety of unusual props, among them a 12ft Christmas Tree, the 34-year-old says she couldn't have been happier with the results. 'I was nervous at first, but once I walked down the aisle carrying my son with my amazingly handsome husband-to-be in front of me, I just felt so calm and happy,' she explained. 'Even though the weather outside was terrible, all our guests were loving every second of the day, and it was just the most amazing feeling to be in that room celebrating with them.' In keeping with their passion for all things magical, the pair even managed to unearth a photographer who moonlights as a magician, and who spent the rest of the wedding entertaining guests with tricks. Even the stars aligned for them on their big day as the photographer they hired also moon-lighted as a magician, and spent the rest of the night doing tricks. Spellbinding: A selection of Potter props, among them a broomstick and Hedwig, created for the wedding . Feeling the force: A huge Star Wars robot created by Mrs Maclean-Price for her nuptials . After the wedding at St Anne's Church in Tonna, the couple and their guests decamped to Bar Gallois in Port Talbot, where both staff and attendees were thrilled by the magical set-up. 'The guests were completely amazed,' revealed Mrs Maclean-Price. 'The venue emailed me afterwards and said they loved it. It was amazing - the perfect day.' Following her unusual wedding, Mrs Maclean-Price is now embarking on a new career as a set designer which she hopes will allow her to indulge in her love of prop-making while making some money from it. 'Currently I'm doing some props for a burlesque show and I would like to work for stage, TV or film,' she revealed. 'It's very exciting for me. This is my passion and I just love being in the studio alone working away. I will do whatever. I am also doing some big Greek columns for theatre. I have been told they are quite sought after. 'The only thing is that it is just me and I would like to expand if it does take off.' And she has already been given a helping hand towards achieving her goal in the shape of a sponsorship at the Revue Studios in Swansea.Business owner Stacey Adamiec, who decided to offer her the award, said: 'Victoria is a natural at prop making, and is one of the only in the area. 'I would like to provide the opportunity to see her develop this as a business not just a hobby, especially with the continuous growth in the South Wales creative industry where there is a huge demand for Victoria's skills in stage, film and TV.'","Victoria Maclean-Price, 34, designed all the props for her unusual wedding .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Chantelle Pringle, pictured in 2008, was just two years old when surgeons amputated her right foot and all the toes from her left . A two-year-old had one foot amputated and all the toes on another removed after a nurse failed to realise she needed treatment for a serious blood infection - and instead prescribed Calpol, a court heard. Chantelle Pringle was lethargic, short of breath and vomiting - so her mother Keeley Grotz, 33, rang the out-of-hours medical phone line for advice. The mother from Barmston, Washington, Tyne and Wear, told a duty nurse her child's symptoms and the medic prescribed Calpol. She then told her to ring back if she still concerned. But Chantelle, now 11, deteriorated rapidly and by the time she got to hospital she was diagnosed with bacterial blood infection septicaemia. Days later surgeons were forced to amputate her right foot and all the toes from her left. Ms Grotz claims the worst damage could have been avoided if her child had received immediate emergency treatment. She is suing Nestor Primecare Services Ltd, who run the out-of-hours service, for £1million damages at London’s High Court. Acting on behalf of the family, Lisa Sullivan told the court Ms Grotz rang the line in the early hours of November 17, 2004. She told the nurse Chantelle was 'wobbly, vomiting and just not right' and the toddler was 'burning up', the court heard. Miss Sullivan claims the nurse should have arranged for an emergency ambulance to be called - but instead she suggested taking Calpol, an over-the-counter paracetamol syrup. Chantelle 'kept waking up' and her mother called an ambulance in the morning after she noticed blemishes on her legs, the court was told. She was then taken to Sunderland Royal Hospital. The child was put on life support and spent eight days in intensive care where her hands and feet turned black. In a two-hour operation on December 6, surgeons removed her right foot and five toes from her left. Her family remained at her bedside until she was allowed home on December 22. Chantelle now has a false leg. At the time, Ms Grotz told local media said: 'She came down with a temperature and was feeling a bit drowsy - I thought it was the flu. 'I called the emergency doctor and he said to leave her until the morning. Next day, I noticed she had a few spots. 'It took a couple of minutes for the ambulance to get here. I was shaking, but they took over. I didn’t want to watch. I had to leave the bedside because it was touch and go. Chantelle, pictured aged 9, with her friend Lucy Hale. London's High Court heard how the child was vomiting and lethargic when her mother called the phone line for advice and a medic suggested Calpol . 'I didn’t know anything about septicaemia. It wasn’t until they put her on a life support machine that they told us. 'They told me if I had waited for an emergency doctor to come, she would have died. 'The first 48 hours were the most critical, whether she would pull through or not. It was just a matter of hoping she would. 'Her feet were really black and her hands were too. You could tell they were actually gone. Her hands were saved by all the stuff she was on - the nine machines around her.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . Police officers are today appealing for help to identify a shopper who died after stabbing herself in the neck in the aisle of a supermarket in Shipley. It is thought the woman was shopping at the ASDA branch when she inflicted the fatal wound to her neck. West Yorkshire Police said a 'number of inquiries' have been carried out to try and identify the woman, who is Asian and is believed to be aged between 20 and 40 years old. Tragic: A woman has died after stabbing herself in the neck in the hardware aisle at a branch of ASDA in Shipley, West Yorkshire . Shock: The victim, who is said to be of Asian appearance, was found lying in an aisle after injuring herself in the neck . Victim: The woman is said to be aged between 20 and 40 years old, and was dressed in traditional clothing. She had shoulder-length dark hair that was tied back in a ponytail . She is described as having shoulder-length dark hair which was tied in a ponytail and was wearing a dark blue top and trousers with large silver buttons to the front and a lighter blue or purple scarf. Detective Inspector Ryan Bragg, of Bradford CID, said: 'We have tried various means to identify this woman but as yet have not been able to do so. 'I would urge anyone who believes they may know the identity of this woman or who has concerns for a family member of friend who fits this description to make contact immediately.' One eye-witness said: 'One of the shop's first aiders was trying to give CPR. 'One of the young men who works there actually saw the woman stabbing herself in the throat. He's in terrible shock. 'Staff told me the woman had come in with a Polish woman and while her friend was at the bakery, she'd stabbed herself. 'Apparently the Polish woman is a regular customer. She was driven off by police.' The store was cordoned off for the majority of today as police forensic teams scour the scene and interview staff and witnesses before examining CCTV. Cordon: West Yorkshire Police have closed the store while forensic officers examine the scene and detectives interview staff members and witnesses. They will also be scouring the CCTV at the store to establish what happened . First aid: Trained members of staff at the Shipley branch rushed to give the woman CPR but a police spokesman said she was pronounced dead at the scene . Not suspicious: The police spokesman said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death . The store reopened at around 3pm - but all the knives from the kitchenware aisle where the woman died had been removed from the shelves. A shopper said: 'They opened the doors bang on 3pm. They took the police tape down and let a few people in. There was really only a little old lady and her husband waiting.' West Yorkshire Police were alerted at around 8.37am to the store, along with paramedics. A spokesman for the police force said the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. He said officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with her death. Det Insp Bragg, said: 'Officers were called to the Asda supermarket in Shipley following a report of a woman inside the premises with serious injuries. 'The woman was pronounced dead at the scene. 'There are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances and no one else is being sought in connection with the incident. Enquiries are ongoing.'

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A man who spent nearly 26 years on death row in Louisiana walked free of prison Tuesday, hours after a judge approved the state's motion to vacate the inmate's murder conviction in the 1983 killing of a jeweler. Glenn Ford, 64, had been on death row since August 1988 in connection with the death of 56-year-old Isadore Rozeman, a Shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom Ford had done occasional yard work. Ford had always denied killing Rozeman. Ford walked out the maximum security prison at Angola this afternoon, said Pam Laborde, a spokeswoman for Louisiana's Department of Public Safety and Corrections. Scroll down for video . First steps to freedom: Glenn Ford, 64, center, walks out of a maximum security . prison, in Angola, La., after having spent . nearly 26 years on death row . Asked as he walked away from the prison gates about his release, Ford told WAFB-TV, 'It feels good; my mind is going in all kind of directions. It feels good.' Ford told the broadcast outlet he does harbor some resentment at being wrongly jailed. 'Yeah, cause, I've been locked up almot 30 years for something I didn't do,' the freed inmate said. 'I can't go back and do anything I should have been doing when I was 35, 38, 40 stuff like that.' The newly liberated man also lamented that he was not there to help raise his sons, who are now grownups. State District Judge Ramona Emanuel on Monday took the step of voiding Ford's conviction and sentence based on new information that corroborated his claim that he was not present or involved in Rozeman's death, Ford's attorneys said. Lost years: Upon leaving death row, Ford told reporters that he does . harbor some resentment at being wrongly jailed and denied the chance to . help raise his sons, who are now grown men . Ford, an African-American, was tried and convicted of first-degree murder by an all-white jury panel in 1984 and sentenced to death. 'We are very pleased to see Glenn Ford finally exonerated, and we are particularly grateful that the prosecution and the court moved ahead so decisively to set Mr. Ford free,' said a statement from Gary Clements and Aaron Novod, the attorneys for Ford from the Capital Post Conviction Project of Louisiana. They said Ford's trial had been . 'profoundly compromised by inexperienced counsel and by the . unconstitutional suppression of evidence, including information from an . informant.' They also . cited what they said was a suppressed police report related to the time . of the crime and evidence involving the murder weapon. The victim's family have been notified of Ford's release from death row in advance. 'We . understand that and actually believe the DA is acting honorably,' the slain jeweler's nephew, Dr Phillip Rozeman, told Shreveport Times. 'This is positive . reflection on the criminal justice system that does the right thing for . people. Color of jusitce: Ford, an African-American (pictured in booking photos), was tried and convicted of first-degree murder by an all-white jury panel in 1984 and sentenced to death . 'We donâ€™t have any animosity for anyone. If someone else was involved or others were involved in his death there also will be justice for those people.' The groundwork for Ford's release was laid last week when prosecutors in Caddo Parish began filing motions suggesting that another suspect had confessed to being the shooter. According to court documents, confidential informant Jake Robinson had revealed that he was the one who pulled the trigger, killing Rozeman. Robinson was one of four people initially charged in the killing. The other three were Ford, George Starks and the informant's brother, Henry Robinson. Lockup: Ford had spent the past 26 years at the Angola penitentiary - one of the largest maximum security prisons in the world with two death row units . Currently, there are 83 men and two women serving death sentences in Louisiana, according to Laborde. A Louisiana law entitles those who have served time but are later exonerated to receive compensation. It calls for payments of $25,000 per year of wrongful incarceration up to a maximum of $250,000, plus up to $80,000 for loss of 'life opportunities.'","Glenn Ford, 64, spent 26 years awaiting execution for 1983 shooting death of jewelers and clockmaker Isadore Rozeman .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Flats have increased in value more than any other property type over the past decade, with a typical rise of £394 per month, a study has found. Terraced houses are the second-best performers, while detached homes have seen the smallest percentage increase in their prices, according to Halifax. Using its own database, Halifax said flat prices had risen by more than a third (35 per cent) on average since 2003, putting them just ahead of terraced homes (32 per cent). Spiral: The average price for a flat, the UK's most popular home, has gone up by 35 per cent in just ten years . Flats are worth almost £47,500 more than they were a decade ago, with a typical price tag of £180,799. Halifax put much of the rise down to the strength of the London market, which has a high proportion of flats. But flats in Scotland have seen the biggest percentage increase in value of anywhere in Britain over the past decade, with a 57 per cent upturn. London flats have increased in value by 37 per cent, but at more than £286,000, the average price of a flat in the capital is more than double that of a flat in Scotland (£121,000). Starter home: The average price of a flat in London has reached £286,000, 37 per cent more than 10 years ago . Halifax said price growth for detached homes, semi-detached properties and bungalows had been constrained in recent years by a lack of home movers. Flats and terraced homes tend to be particularly popular with first-time buyers, who have recently returned to their market in their strongest numbers since the economic downturn. The rise has been attributed to the launch of a string of Government measures to improve mortgage availability, such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy. Property search website Rightmove reported last month that asking prices for flats had reached an all-time high. Economist: Martin Ellis says larger properties are under performing in comparison with properties typically favoured by first-time buyers . This, it said, was due to growing demand from first-time buyers coupled with high numbers of buy-to-let investors looking for decent returns as the rental market remains strong. In Wales, terraced homes have increased their value faster than any other property type, recording a 55 per cent rise over the last decade. The West Midlands and the South East were the only regions where flats or terraces were not the best-performing property types. Bungalows came out best in the West Midlands, where their value has risen by one third (33 per cent) over the decade. Semi-detached homes were the best-performers in the South East, recording a 22 per cent rise in value over 10 years. The value of flats and terraced homes was particularly badly hit between 2007-09, when banks tightened their borrowing criteria amid the economic troubles, making it tougher for first-time buyers to get a mortgage. During that period, the value of terraced houses and flats fell by around one third following a period of strong growth when low deposit mortgages had been more widely available. Bungalows and detached homes were best at retaining their value in the couple of years following the price crash as they tend to be less reliant on the first-time buyer market. But Halifax said that price growth for detached homes, semi-detached properties and bungalows has been constrained in recent years by a lack of home movers. Detached homes recorded the smallest percentage increase in value over the last decade at 17 per cent, making them worth £286,175 on average. Bungalows and semi-detached homes have seen their values increase by just under one quarter (24 per cent) over the last 10 years. Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said: 'During the recovery since 2009 larger property types such as detached homes, semis and bungalows have under-performed flats and terraces. 'The demand for such properties has been partly constrained by a widespread lack of equity amongst home owners who bought for the first time around the peak in the market.' Stagnant: Detached homes, such as this £1.5million home in London, have increased at the slowest rate .","Flat prices have risen by 35 per cent since 2003 according to Halifax .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The United States has begun a landmark project to clean up a dangerous chemical left from the defoliant Agent Orange - 50 years after it was first sprayed by American planes on Vietnam's jungles to destroy enemy cover. Work will now begin to remove Dioxin, which has been linked to cancer, birth defects and other disabilities, from the site of a former U.S. air base in Danang in central Vietnam. The US sprayed millions of gallons of Agent Orange over the course of a decade. U.S. plane spraying delta area with dioxin-tainted herbicide, the defoliant Agent Orange . Millions of gallons were dumped during the conflict in bid to destroy enemy cover . The U.S. military dumped 20 million . gallons of the dioxin, which has been linked to cancer, birth defects and other disabilities, and other herbicides on . about a quarter of former South Vietnam between 1962 and 1971, decimating about five million acres of forest, including above. The . war ended on April 30, 1975, when northern Communist forces seized . control of Saigon, the U.S.-backed capital of former South Vietnam. The country was then reunified under a one-party Communist government and Vietnam finally normalized relations with the U.S. in 1995. But the Agent Orange issue has continued to blight the relationship because the dioxin can linger in soils and at the bottom of . lakes and rivers for generations, entering the food supply through the . fat of fish and other animals. It is not water-soluble and only spreads when rainfall and run-off move contaminated mud. Although . the chemical remains at the Danang site, U.S. officials said Thursday . that containment measures implemented in recent years temporarily ended . the public health threat to the local community. Vietnam . says several million people have been affected by the toxic defoliant, . including more than 150,000 children who have since been born with . severe birth defects. The landmark effort has been heralded as a long-overdue step toward removing a thorn in relations between the former enemies. It comes nearly four decades after the Vietnam War ended. The $43 million joint project with . Vietnam is expected to be completed in four years on the 47-acre . contaminated site, located near Danang's commercial airport and an . active Vietnamese military base. A groundbreaking ceremony took place near the area where a rusty barbed wire fence marks the site's boundary. US Ambassador David Shear said: 'We are both moving earth and taking the first steps to bury the legacies of our past.' Washington has been slow to respond. For years officials have demanded more scientific research be carried out to show that the herbicide caused health problems and birth defects among Vietnamese. Since 2007, it has given about $60 million for environmental restoration and social services in Vietnam, but this is its first direct involvement in cleaning up dioxin, which has seeped into Vietnam's soil and watersheds for generations. Shear added the U.S. is planning to evaluate what is needed for remediation at the former Bien Hoa air base in southern Vietnam, another Agent Orange hotspot.The remediation begins as Vietnam and the U.S. forge closer ties to boost trade and counter China's rising influence in the disputed South China Sea that's believed rich in oil and natural resources. The U.S. says protecting peace and freedom of navigation in the sea is in its national interest. The Danang site is closed to the public. Part of it consists of a dry field where U.S. troops once stored and mixed the defoliant before it was loaded onto planes. The area is ringed by tall grass and a faint chemical smell could be detected during a visit to the area Thursday. The contaminated area also includes lakes and wetlands dotted with pink lotus flowers where dioxin has seeped into soil and sediment over decades. A high concrete wall separates it from nearby communities and serves as a barrier to keep residents from fishing in the tainted water. A heavily  dioxin-contaminated area is marked by a yelow flag seen at Danang airport, a former US airbase, where a  ground-breaking ceremony of the joint US-Vietnam Dioxin Cleanning Project was held . A red warning poster reading 'Dioxin-contominated area. Livestock and poultry raising and fishing are prohibited', is seen at the Ho Sen or Lotus Lake located next to Danang airport .

Dioxin is not water-soluble and only spreads when rainfall and runoff move contaminated mud. Vietnam's Ministry of Defense and the U.S. now plan to excavate 73,000 cubic meters (2.5 million cubic feet) employing technology used to clean superfund sites in the U.S. Workers will first dig down about 2 meters (6.56 feet). The soil will then be heated to 335 degrees C (635 Fahrenheit) in special containers where the dioxin will break down into oxygen, carbon dioxide and othersubstances that pose no health risks to humans or animals. Vietnam's deputy defense minister, Nguyen Chi Vinh, said he hopes to receive more support from the international community and the U.S. government to help remediate dioxin hotspots elsewhere across the country. The former U.S. air base in southern Phu Cat has already been identified, but he said many dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam have not been adequately assessed. It is still unclear how much the U.S. will help clean up in the long term and how much it will allocate for people who claim to be Agent Orange victims.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and Rupert Steiner . and Amie Keeley . Neuroscientist and computer genius Demis Hassabis, 37, has sold his company DeepMind to Google for £242million . A comprehensive school-educated computer genius has become a multi-millionaire overnight after selling his company to Google. Neuroscientist Demis Hassabis, 37, co-founded DeepMind Technologies just two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. His company has yet to produce anything commercially but Google has still paid £242million for its expertise in the pioneering field of artificial intelligence. It represents Google’s biggest ever single acquisition in Europe. Mr Hassabis told MailOnline: 'We’re really excited to be joining Google. 'This . partnership will allow us to turbo-charge our mission to harness the . power of machine learning tools to tackle some of society’s toughest . problems, and help make our everyday lives more productive and . enjoyable.' The website . states DeepMind uses ‘the best techniques from machine learning and . systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning . algorithms.’ A friend of Mr Hassabis said: ‘He has very forward-looking ideas and can spot where industries are heading in the future.’ Programmes . that predict the way people think and can even teach computers to think . for themselves are set to be the next big breakthrough in technology. It . is believed Facebook had been interested in buying London-based . DeepMind Technologies, which employs 75 people, but Google has now . stolen a march on its rival. Mr Hassabis grew up in Hendon, north London. At the age of four, he saw . his father, a Greek-Cypriot entrepreneur, playing chess and asked to be . taught the rules. Within weeks, he was beating his father. A couple of . years later he was programming computers. The acquisition by the Californian-based giant is the biggest single purchase in Europe. DeepMind specialises in 'machine learning' designing computers that can learn from their mistakes . The acquisition of DeepMind isn’t Google’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning. Its . most recent Hummingbird search update was created to make Google 'more . human' - searches can now understand context, like a human brain, for . example. Its Google Now app . uses ‘predictive analysis’ to predict what Android users will do next, . before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever . being asked. Google also hired futurist Ray Kurzweil as Engineering Director in 2012. Kurzweil . has famously claimed that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to . upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - . an event called singularity. He also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100. He . took his A-levels early at just 15 and says his local comprehensive . kept him on a ‘light rein’ which enabled him to develop his other . interests. He went on to Cambridge University where he graduated with a . double first in computer science. Mr . Hassabis once said: ‘When my parents saw that I was precocious in some . areas, they simply encouraged me. In fact, they know nothing about . computers.’ He set up . DeepMind with two other entrepreneurs, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. The business also counted Founders Fund, the venture firm started by . Facebook backer Peter Thiel, as an investor. They will share in the . £242million windfall. This latest acquisition follows Google's recent purchase of seven robotics firms, including Meka, which makes humanoid robots, and Industrial Perception, which specialises in machines that can package goods and load up lorries, for example. However, instead of being used in the robotics division, it is more likely DeepMind, and its expertise, will be used to improve Google's current technologies - including voice and text search. Google's most recent Hummingbird search update, for example, was created to make Google 'more . human' and searches can now understand context, like a human brain. DeepMind's technology could help develop this further. Google recently bought a series of robotic companies including California-based Meka, which makes humanoid robots, pictured. The firm isn't expected to make these technologies available to consumers but instead could use them to automate deliveries of goods . Reports claim Google has also agreed to set up an ethics board to make sure the DeepMind AI technology isn’t 'abused', sources familiar with the plans told The Information. DeepMind designs machine learning algorithms for retailers and gamers . The DeepMind-Google ethics board is set to create a series of rules and restrictions over the use of the technology. This isn’t Google’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Scroll down to video . Spain's Princess Cristina is in court today to be questioned over whether she and her husband illegally used company funds for personal expenses, including lavish parties at their modernist Barcelona mansion . Cristina, the first Spanish royal to be questioned in court since the monarchy was restored in 1975, faced Judge Jose Castro, who has summoned her as a fraud and money laundering suspect . Cristina took a dozen steps to get inside, looking briefly toward the cameras with a smile and giving a two-word greeting: 'Buenos dias' ('good morning'). Cristina, the first Spanish royal to be questioned in court since the monarchy was restored in 1975, faced Judge Jose Castro, who has summoned her as a fraud and money laundering suspect. Saturday's closed-door session is a key step in determining whether she will be charged. The legal troubles of King Juan Carlos' youngest daughter have seriously damaged the image of Spain's monarchy at a time of 26 percent unemployment, outrage over political corruption, unpopular tax hikes and cutbacks to cherished government programs. Hundreds of protesters blew shrieking whistles, revved motorcycle engines, honked car horns and chanted 'Out with the Spanish crown' as she arrived . The legal troubles of King Juan Carlos' youngest daughter have seriously damaged the image of Spain's monarchy . A mystery over whether she would decide to walk about 50 paces down an alley leading to the entrance in a Spanish version of a 'perp walk' ended when the car drove down the alley instead . Cristina was to answer questions from a high-backed chair directly facing Castro. A picture of her father - Spain's head of state - was mounted on the wall behind the judge. The use, or suspected abuse, of company funds to cover household expenses for her Barcelona mansion is among the evidence Castro has compiled about Aizoon, the real estate and consulting firm that Cristina owned with her husband, Olympic handball medalist turned businessman Inaki Urdangarin. Castro has referred to Aizoon in court paperwork as a 'front company.' Castro says in court records that many company expenses that appear personal in nature were never declared on the couple's income tax returns, and that he must determine whether the amounts spent reach an annual value of more than 120,000 euros ($163,630) that could turn the non-reporting into a crime punishable by prison. Accused: Princess Cristina, pictured with her husband Inaki Urdangarin, has been named as a suspect in a corruption case involving him . If the amounts are less, the likely result would be an administrative tax investigation and possible fines. The case stems directly from another one led by the same judge where he is investigating Urdangarin for allegedly using his position as the Duke of Palma to embezzle public contracts via the Noos Institute, a supposedly nonprofit foundation he and a business partner set up that channeled money to other businesses, including Aizoon. Court paperwork shows that Castro is keen to clear up uncertainty about 1.2 million euros that may have been transferred from Noos to Aizoon. The 48-year-old princess, a bank foundation director known for her love of skiing and sailing, has been cleared of involvement in Noos. Allegations: The investigation into Mr Urdangarin's business dealings has caused embarrassment for the Spanish Royal Family. He is pictured here with Princess Cristina and King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia . Spain's royal family is eager to have the case - that has dragged on for years - to end rapidly so it can try to rebuild the trust it once had, Spanish royalty watchers say. The monarchy enjoyed high esteem for decades because Juan Carlos played a strong role in the transition from dictatorship to democracy. But now it is tarnished by a combination of the princess' legal woes and the king's own catastrophic decision to go on an expensive elephant hunting safari in 2012 - just as the nation teetered on the edge of financial chaos during Europe's debt crisis.","Spanish King Juan Carlos's Cristina appeared at a court in Palma, Majorca .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A French official was shot dead at the wheel of his car by two assailants on a motorbike shortly after supporting his daughter's bid to become a local politician. Jean Leccia was killed in the town of Aleria, on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, police have said. The 53-year-old government services director was killed yesterday as he returned from a different town where his daughter was bidding for a seat on the local council. Government services director Jean Leccia was shot dead at the wheel of his car in the town of Aleria, on the island of Corsica, yesterday . The crime scene was inspected by a local prosecutor after police cordoned off the area, AFP have reported. The killing was the second suspected murder on the island this year, according to reports, while last year saw 17 murders and 14 attempted murders. In September 2012, MailOnline reported how three men were killed by suspected gangsters as they travelled up a mountain road in Corsica. The shooting was in a hamlet called Pont-de-Castirla, close to the village of Castirla, in north Corsica. The crime scene was inspected by a local prosecutor after police cordoned off the area . A local judicial source said that the car was hit by 'a volley of snipers' bullets' which killed everybody. At least one of the victims was 'known to the police' with a suspected 'settling of accounts' being the motive for the attack, said the same source. Corsica is reportedly notorious for its criminal gangs, with bandits regularly attacking each other with guns and bombs.","Government services director Jean Leccia killed on island of Corsica .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Children who have unusual or oddly spelt names tend to fare worse in the classroom, academics have claimed. Teachers may subconsciously lower their expectations for pupils with names such as Destiny, Kayleegh and Chantal. Alternatively, they tend to predict higher grades from students with traditional names - like Catherine or William. Drawing inference: Children who have unusual or oddly spelt names tend to fare worse in the classroom, academics have claimed. Teachers tend to lower their expectations for pupils with names such as Destiny . This may suggest that teachers draw conclusions about pupils' backgrounds on the basis of their names, according to The Times Educational Supplement (TES). Meanwhile, what a child is called could also reflect their parents' backgrounds and achievements. James Bruning, Professor of Psychology at Ohio University in America, told the supplement: 'Clearly all of us use stereotypes about all sorts of things, and names are one of those things. 'It is a first impression. If you only have a name as a guide then of course you make assumptions based on that.' Mr Bruning said that if people were asked which of two students - Wa Wei Lee and Kahine Jefferson - was more likely to better at mathematics, most would opt for the Chinese pupil. This decision would likely be based on an assumption that children of South-East Asian heritage are better with numbers, he said. It comes as a study of two million children in Florida found that youngsters with traditional names were more likely to achieve higher grades in their end-of-year tests. Higher expectations: Meanwhile, teachers may subconsciously predict higher grades from students with traditional names, such as those named after the future King and Queen, William and Catherine (pictured) David Figlio, Professor of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University, near Chicago, used a computer programme to analyse the records of siblings with contrasting names. He discovered that teachers tend to alter their expectations based on pupils' names - with those predicted higher results tending to perform better. He told the TES: 'Over and over again, teachers hinted at the fact that they draw inferences about kids' backgrounds from things like their names.' Last year, Apprentice star Katie Hopkins, . 38, sparked controversy by claiming it was acceptable to judge children . based on their names.

"By . Mark Prigg . It is one of the earliest examples of natural camouflage ever found - and an ancient relative of the stick insect. An international team of scientists said on Wednesday they have discovered the fossil of an insect in China that lived about 126 million years ago whose appearance mimicked that of a nearby plant. It is the oldest-known stick or leaf insect that used such natural trickery, they said. A fossil stick insect referred to as Cretophasmomima melanogramma, in Inner Mongolia at the Jehol locality, a site from the Cretaceous period (L), and a plant fossil, Membranifolia admirabilis (R) are pictured in this handout photo courtesy of, Olivier Bethoux, a paleontologist with the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. There are roughly 3,200 known species of stick and leaf insects, which are members of the insect order known as Phasmatodea, derived from the ancient Greek word for phantom for their ability to seemingly disappear into the background. They are also sometimes called a walking stick or a walking leaf and are among the most striking creatures in the insect world, developing unusual shapes to camouflage themselves as vegetation to avoid detection by predators. Some have flattened, leaf-like shapes, with appropriate color, while others possess cylindrical bodies shaped like sticks or like bark. One Malaysian variety, commonly known as Chan's megastick, is the world's longest insect at about 22 inches long. The insect, named Cretophasmomima melanogramma, was found in Liaoning province in northeastern China, part of the Jehol rock formation that has yielded many stunningly detailed fossils of creatures like early birds and feathered dinosaurs. The researchers realized the insect looked remarkably like the leaf of a plant that grew in the same place at the time that was a relative of the Ginkgo tree. The fossil showed wings with parallel dark lines that, when the bug was in the resting position, seemed to produce a tongue-like shape that could hide its abdomen, they said. The plant had similar tongue-shaped leaves marked with multiple lines. The researchers think the insect evolved to look like these leaves - even their green color - and concealed itself from predators by mingling with the foliage. Females of this insect were estimated at about 2.2 inches (55 mm) long and the males a bit smaller. The insect is believed to be related to modern stick insects such as those shown here with keeper Don McFarland during the annual stock-take at London Zoo . 'Cretophasmomima melanogramma is one of the grand-cousins of today's stick and leaf insects,' said paleontologist Olivier Béthoux of the Center for Research on Paleobiodiversity and Paleoenvironments (CR2P) and the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, one of the researchers. The findings were published in the online journal PLOS ONE. Cretophasmomima melanogramma lived during the Cretaceous, the last of the three time periods that make up the Mesozoic Era, sometimes called the Age of Dinosaurs. It lived in a warm and wet environment with a large array of plants, dominated by conifers but also featuring relatives of the Gingko, cycas and others. The arrival of small insect-eating birds and agile, branch-walking mammals provided good reason for insects to develop new predator-avoidance strategies like mimicking the appearance of a leaf, Béthoux said. The researchers said this insect lacked some characteristics of similar insects seen today, such as a curved part of the front legs that hide the head.","55mm long insect looked like a leaf similar to a Gingko tree .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ap . 'I'm gonna flip this bus!': Maquel Donyel Morris is accused of attacking a Greyhound driver in Arizona early Thursday, causing the bus to careen into a median, injuring dozens . Dozens were injured early Thursday when a crazed man attacked the driver of a Greyhound bus, causing it to smash into a median in the middle of the Arizona desert. Police say Maquel Donyel Morris, 25, was 'very high' when he assaulted the driver before 2am near Tonopah and nearly caused the bus to swerve into oncoming traffic on Interstate 10 as he screamed, 'I'm gonna flip this bus!' Three of the 41 passengers had to be airlifted from the scene after Morris very nearly accomplished his goal before running off into the desert with his girlfriend only to return 30 minutes later. That's when Arizona authorities placed him under arrest. 'He was hallucinating ... we believe . he was very high,' Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Bart . Graves told the LA Times. According to Graves, Morris's girlfriend informed police Graves was under the influence of methamphetamine. Despite . all his efforts, the bus remained upright and none of the 24 people . taken to hospitals had life-threatening injuries, the DPS said. Passengers . say that's thanks in large part to the efforts of the as yet unnamed . driver, who at no point in the terrifying ordeal took his hands off the . steering wheel. While he was being pummeled, the driver called for passengers to 'get this guy off me,' passenger Gregory Forte told KNXV. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: Dozens were injured and three had to be airlifted from the side of I-10 after the bus smashed into the median . 'They're gonna kill me! Call my mom': Morris fled into the desert wilds with his girlfriend before returning 30 minutes later. That's when police arrested him and his bizarre state of mind became all too apparent . 'The passengers descended on him,' DPS spokesman Bart Graves told The Associated Press. The . injuries included a broken sternum suffered by one of the passengers . who helped restrain the attacker, said DPS Officer Carrick Cook, another . DPS spokesman. The attacker and his female companion got off the bus when it stopped and fled into the desert wilds 50 miles outside Phoenix. Thirty minutes later, the couple returned for unknown reasons and the suspect was arrested by highway patrol. The girlfriend told azfamily.com that he was 'paranoid' and 'did not want to be on the bus.' 'Pull him off me!': There were 41 passengers aboard the Dallas-bound bus, some of whom quickly pulled the attacker off the driver around 2am before it came to a stop about 50 miles outside Phoenix . 'He started crying and I knew something was wrong,' passenger Gregory Forte said of Morris in the moments before the attack. 'It was bizarre. I hope I never have to go through anything like this ever again' As he was hauled away in a police car, Morris continued his frightening behavior. 'They're going to kill me,' he screamed from the back of the car to his girlfriend. 'Call my mom!' Morris was taken to a hospital for treatment of a drug-induced condition and was expected to be booked on suspicion of numerous counts of endangerment, assault and aggravated assault, the DPS said. Greyhound spokeswoman Alexandra Pedrini said the bus was carrying 41 passengers, plus the driver. Westbound lanes of I-10 were closed for 30 minutes so helicopters could land and shuttle out the most injured among the passengers. The 20 or so passengers left behind were seen huddled with blankets by the highway waiting for a relief bus to come. Most of them were thankful just to be alive. Could have been much worse: Multiple children and at least two infants were reportedly aboard the bus, though police say miraculously no one sustained life threatening injuries .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A widow has made one of the biggest donations to the Conservative Party in its history - while leaving nothing for her family. Violet Baker, who died aged 85 last year, bequeathed a staggering £769,000 to the party in her will. But she gave nothing to her relatives - and just £2,000 to the man who cared for her during her final years of life. Donation: Violet Baker, pictured front, has made one of the biggest donations to the Tory party in its history. She has given nothing to her family and just £2,000 to the man who cared for her during her final years of life . Ms Baker, who lived in a modest semi-detached house in Birmingham, specified in her will that she wished to leave her 'entire estate' aside from the £2,000 to the Conservative Party, her solicitor, Michael Wooldridge, told The Telegraph. He added that the widow had been 'fully compos mentis' when bequeathing the sum, which is one of the largest donations the Tory party has ever received. During her final three years of her life, Ms Baker was cared for by her neighbour, Malcolm Baker, who visited her three times a day. Today, Mr .

Ms Baker, who had no children, received more than £500,000 worth of investments in stocks, . shares and bonds after her husband passed away in 2009.

"By . Luke Mcilveen . A teenage thug who stabbed a partygoer - then urged a gang of friends to kick and stamp on him as he lay dying - has been jailed for a minimum of 15 years. Jimmy Connors, 17, was high on cocaine when he plunged a kitchen knife into Joe Walker, 23, outside a party in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Connors led a pack of 12 who chased Mr Walker onto grassland, plunged a knife into his back and then stood back while the thugs repeatedly kicked and stamped him. Jimmy Connors (left) was high on cocaine when he knifed Joe Walker (right) outside a party in Sheffield . Apparently pleased with his work, Connors walked away 'elated, happy and proud' of what he had done. He was found guilty of murder after a trial and today jailed for a minimum of 15 years at Sheffield Crown Court. Mr Justice John Griffith Williams said: 'Although you were only just 17-years-old when you murdered Joe Walker, I am satisfied that your reputation was such that people were frightened of you. 'And it is not surprising that people were frightened of you because you went out that night armed with a knife which you were clearly prepared to use.' The court heard Joe Walker (above) had been defending his friend who was punched and racially abused before Connors and the gang turned on him . The court previously heard that Mr Walker, of Sheffield, had been at a party in the city last September along with his friend Dennis Patterson. The trouble began when Mr Patterson went outside for a cigarette, the court heard. Mr Patterson told jurors he was attacked by a man outside the house after he was subjected to abuse from the other side of the road. The unprovoked attack left him with a broken nose and he went back into the house bleeding. Jade West, also at the party, said she . heard the argument from an upstairs bedroom and testified that Mr . Patterson had racist abuse hurled at him. The gang of thugs led by Connors chased Mr Walker to grassland nearby and pinned his arms back before knifing him . Ms West told the court she told Mr Walker about the attack, who replied he 'wasn't having people hitting his friend' and rushed outside to defend him. Mr Patterson said: 'Connors was shouting abuse at Joe, effing and blinding, and Joe ended up hitting him once. It knocked him back. 'The defendant then pulled a blade out from his trousers. It was a big kitchen knife, about eight inches.' Mr Walker was then chased by Connors and his gang down a pathway into a grassy area near the house, where the stabbing happened. Ms West said she saw Mr Walker's arms being held back, and she screamed for help. After Mr Walker was knifed she said she heard the defendant tell him: ‘You’re not going to do nowt now you’re laid out’. 'I saw Joe staggering and holding his side,' she said. 'His eyes were flickering. I didn’t know what was happening at first. He didn’t look like Joe at all.' Mr Walker died from massive internal bleeding soon after the attack . 'I was shouting for help. My phone battery was dead so I couldn’t ring an ambulance. That’s when someone came down and tried to give him mouth-to-mouth and she rang an ambulance.' The blade had severed an artery, causing severe internal bleeding, and Mr Walker died a short time later from his injuries. Mr Justice Griffith Williams said he was satisfied on the evidence that Joe Walker was not the sort of person to use 'gratuitous' violence. He said: 'Joe Walker must have been very frightened indeed [when you chased after him]. 'When you caught up with you stabbed him in the back, and not content with that you stood there when the others attacked him. 'Your immediate reaction was to boast about what you had done.' The judge lifted a reporting restriction banning the media from identifying the killer, who it emerged first started appearing before the courts when he was aged just 12. Jurors heard that the year before the fatal knife attack, Connors was handed a youth rehabilitation order for carrying an offensive weapon, an extendable baton, in a public place. Other previous convictions include burglary, car theft, possession of cannabis and theft from vehicles. In a statement, Mr Walker's parents Patrick Walker and Karen Foulstone, said: 'Nothing will ever take away the pain and heartache we feel, nor will it bring back our son. 'People need to think twice about carrying and using knives. It only shows their weaknesses. 'We are still numb from Joe’s death. Our lives have been turned upside down and the loss of Joe is difficult to describe. 'At home there is silence no laughing or joking - just tears and photographs of happier times.'","Jimmy Connors, 17, knifed Joe Walker, 23, at party in .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nicolas Sarkozy intervened in divorce proceedings on behalf of the Aga Khan four years after granting the multi-billionaire British knight exemption from all French taxes, it emerged today. The former French president, who is a lawyer, took on the case last Autumn a year after a court ordered the religious leader to pay his estranged German wife, Begum Inaara Aga Khan, around £54million. Mr Sarkozy was 'pulling the strings in the background' with the aim of obtaining a settlement, according to sources close to the case. 'Pulling the strings': Nicolas Sarkozy intervened on behalf of the Aga Khan (left) in his divorce proceedings with estranged wife Begum Inaara Aga Khan (centre), seen here on their wedding day in 1998 . Lawyers for both sides have declined to confirm or deny the claims, but legal e-mails seen by The Times are said to refer to his direct role from October to December. In the end, however, no agreement was reached. Details of Mr Sarkozy's involvement emerged as the Prince's office confirmed the highest French court has now quashed the £54million divorce settlement from 2011. The original appeal decision, made by a court in Amiens, had attributed all responsibility for the marriage breakdown to the Aga Khan, 76, after ruling that his affair with an airline stewardess was to blame. But that settlement has now been thrown out by the Paris Cour de Cassation after the twice-married billionaire should not bear all responsibility for the split from the 49-year-old Begum, also known as Gabriele Thyssen. The couple, who have a 13-year-old son, Aly, are now expected to face a retrial in around a year's time in what has already been an eight-year legal battle fought in Switzerland, Britain and now France. Eight-year legal fight: Details of Mr Sarkozy's involvement emerged as the Prince's office confirmed the highest French court has now quashed the £54million divorce settlement to the Begum from 2011 . 'Exonerated': The multi-billionaire British Knight (left) was allegedly let off paying any taxes in France by . Mr Sarkozy (right), according to a leaked letter . from a corruption inquiry . A spokesman for Mr Sarkozy declined to comment on his possible role in the divorce, while the Aga Khan's lawyer was not available for comment yesterday. The Aga Khan's spokesman made no comment other than to confirm to The Times that the Paris Court had 'struck down all provisions of the Amiens court of appeal'. Lawyers for the Begum only confirmed that the divorce ruling had been quashed. The Aga Khan divorced his first wife, . Sally Croker-Poole, a former English model, in 1995 – paying £20 million . to the mother of three of his children. His second wife, born Gabriele Thyssen . in Frankfurt, was previously married to German royal Prince Earl-Emich . zu Leiningen. They divorced in 1997. Last autumn, it emerged that the Aga Khan has been 'exonerated' from paying any tax at all by Mr Sarkozy. Controversy: Mr Sarkozy intervened in the divorce deal at around the same time as it emerged he was facing corruption allegations including that he illegally accepted cash from Liliane Bettencourt (pictured), France's richest woman, to pay for his election campaign in 2007 . It meant the tycoon, a Muslim prince who was given the title 'His Highness' by the Queen in 1957 and made a Knight Commander in 2004, could protect his vast fortune across the Channel. This was despite being worth as much as £6billion and owning mansions, yachts, private jets, some 800 race horses and even a private island in the Bahamas. Details of the arrangement came as it was revealed Mr Sarkozy faced a string of corruption enquiries. Allegations against the 57-year-old include claims that he illegally accepted cash from Liliane Bettencourt, France's richest woman, to pay for his election campaign in 2007, allegedly in return for future tax breaks for the L'Oreal heiress. According to a letter leaked to the Paris investigative website Mediapart, Mr Sarkozy used 'exceptional powers' to assist the Aga Khan, who was born in Switzerland but who has maintained strong links with Britain all his life. Royal approval: The Aga Khan (left) greets Queen Elizabeth II, who gave him the title 'High Highness' in 1957. Also pictured is former French president Jacques Chirac (centre) and the Duke of Edinburgh (right) The letter, dated April 4, 2008, pledged that the Aga Khan would be let off all 'direct taxes, stamp duty, and wealth tax' - saving him billions. Mr Sarkozy gave the Aga Khan an obscure diplomatic 'courtesy' fiscal status usually reserved for heads of state. The then president, who lost the election to Francois Hollande in May, said a tax bill of zero was justified because the Aga Khan, who claims to be a direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed, runs a charitable foundation funding the poor in Africa and Asia. Sarkozy wrote in the letter - published in full by Mediapart - that he offered the status after 'my government informed me about your project to establish in France an important delegation of the Swiss foundation, the Aga Khan Development Network'. It was approved by Mr Sarkozy's budget minister Eric Woerth, MP for Chantilly, north of Paris, where the Aga Khan owns an estate and plunged millions into a historic racetrack and equestrian centre. Mr Woerth is currently at the centre of two corruption enquiries, including the so-called 'Bettencourt Affair', which could see both he and Mr Sarkozy prosecuted. The Paris mansion Sarkozy shares with his third wife, Carla Bruni, was raided by police after he lost his presidential immunity from prosecution. Both Mr Sarkozy and Mr Woerth deny any wrong-doing.","Mr Sarkozy took on case after billionaire was ordered to pay £54m to wife .

Fresh attempts are to be made to find the 'missing' gold of the last Tsar of Russia, believed to in Siberia . Fresh attempts are to be made to find the 'missing' gold of the last Tsar of Russia - worth 'up to £50 billion' at today's prices - which is believed to be stashed or lost in Siberia. Some 95 years after Nicholas the Second and his family were shot by a firing squad loyal to Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, six sites have been identified where the royal treasure may be located. Two of them are in the world's deepest lake and another is in a region notorious for its gulag prison camps during the Stalin era. Gold from the Russian Imperial state was moved eastward during the First World War and initially held in Kazan on the Volga River. 'One of Britain's most legendary spies, Sidney Reilly, and the colourful, womanising diplomat, Robert Bruce Lockhart, who with his lover Baroness Moura Budberg, Russia's 'Mata Hari', was accused of plotting to assassinate Lenin, were directly involved in this operation to prevent the gold falling into Communist hands,' said the Siberian Times. The bed-hopping baroness - who also slept with writers HG Wells and Maxim Gorky - was the great great aunt of deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. After the Reds seized power in the capital, Petrograd, now St Petersburg, the anti-Communists moved it by train into Siberia. Here it was under the control of Admiral Alexander Kolchak, who led the White Russian forces loyal to the royal family during the civil war which engulfed the country from 1918-20. Certainly some of the treasure was used to buy arms to use against Lenin's forces, but historians are divided over how much was later grabbed by the Communists. Doubts also remain on the quantity of Tsarist gold sneaked abroad or hidden or lost in Siberia .

Baroness Moura Budberg, the great great aunt of Nick Clegg is said to be involved in the affair . Diplomat Robert Bruce Lockhart was also said to be involved in the plan to protect the gold . 'Groups of intrepid searchers have not given up hope of finding this treasure, convinced that it never fell into the hands of the Soviet authorities, and hoping this will be the lucky year for the royal gold rush,' said The Siberian Times. This year marks the 400th anniversary of the fallen House of Romanov. 'I am convinced that at least some of the tsar's gold remains in Siberia and I continue to hunt for it,' said a researcher working at two of the suspected sites where the Romanov bullion is hidden. 'I will not divulge the locations I am searching but modern technology makes it more likely than ever before to be able to find the gold stashed beneath the surface.' A Mir-2 mini-submarine in 2010 located allegedly 'shiny metal objects' some 1,300 feet below the surface of Lake Baikal in an area close to where a train carrying gold was rumoured to have crashed are the time of Kolchak's arrest and execution by the Soviet authorities in 1920. More dives are expected for bullion at this site, but another theory is that White troops carrying gold tried crossing ice bound Baikal - the world's deepest lake - in winter but perished on  as temperatures slumped to minus 60C. After the Reds (pictured) seized power in the capital, Petrograd, now St Petersburg, the anti-Communists moved the gold by train into Siberia . When the ice melted in spring, the gold sank to the bottom of the lake. Other theories link stashes of the the 1,600 tons of gold to two sites in Omsk, where Kolchak had his headquarters. One is in labyrinthine passages under the city, another close to a nearby village, Zakhlamino. A further possible site is in the former gulag region of Krasnoyarsk, where a mysterious graveyard of some 500 White soldiers is alleged to have been found. Local folklore suggests the forces stashed the gold shortly before they were slaughtered. Meanwhile author Valery Kurnosov believes MI6 has information on a separate collection of gold and treasures from a tsarist-era bank close to Kazan. A British secret agent called Roger Gariel was involved in a joint operation in 1928 involving the Soviet government and Western figures to find the gold in a forest near the city. The operation failed and the Soviet government later continued the hunt but never found it, he said. Historian Oleg Budnitskii, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has disputed the value of the 'Kolchak Gold' inherited from Imperial Russia, saying it was worth £3 billion maximum. He also claims none remains hidden, arguing it was all accounted for. A further possible site is in the former . gulag region of Krasnoyarsk, where a mysterious graveyard of some 500 .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . and Ap . Just eight months after winning a $338million Powerball jackpot, Pedro Quezada, 45, is being sued by his former live-in girlfriend for a portion of the fortune. During a press conference last March, Quezada told reporters that he would buy his girlfriend, Ines Sanchez 'whatever she wants' with the money. But now his lawyer is arguing that Sanchez doesn't deserve any of the winnings because the couple, who lived together for 10 years, was never legally married. Sanchez's attorneys disagree. They say Quezada . purchased the winning lottery ticket with money earned by the couple. In 2006, Quezada and Sanchez jointly opened a bodega in Passaic, New Jersey, which was run by Quezada's son Casiano. Sanchez and Quezada have a child together as well as children from previous relationships. Pedro Quezada (right) and his ex-girlfriend Ines Sanchez at a press conference in March.

Last spring Quezada drew the winning ticket worth $338.3million. It's the fourth-largest jackpot in Powerball history. After taxes Quezada received a check for $152million. On Friday Superior Court Chancery Judge Margaret Mary McVeigh decided not to throw out the lawsuit, but she did deny Sanchez's request to freeze Quezada's lottery money until a trial and verdict determines if she is entitled to a portion of the winnings. According to The Record, the judge explained that while she acknowledged the long term relationship Sanchez and Quezada shared as well as Sanchez's contributions to the household, she legally she could not restrain Quezada's assets. Clifton resident Pedro Quezada,who won millions in the Powerball lottery, appears in Superior Court on Nov. 8, 2013. A judge deniedd Quezada's former girlfriend Ines Sanchez, whom he lived with for 10 years, request to freeze Quezada's assets until her fair share can be determined in court. 'That’s what money does to people: It changes positive relationships into bad ones,' McVeigh said. 'It doesn’t always enhance a relationship, or bring out people’s better qualities. Her [Sanchez’s] life has been up-ended by this winning ticket…But I am a judge. I don’t create the law. I have to follow it,' she said. The Record reported that the judge went on to explain that 'something in writing' was needed. 'Our Legislature has spoken.

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Patients with high blood pressure could be taking drugs needlessly because they suffer from ‘white coat’ nerves. A scientific review says many people give artificially high readings because they are anxious when the doctor gives them a blood pressure check. For the first time the research suggests that doctors, but not nurses, are the main cause of the phenomenon. 'White coat' phenomenon happens when a patient becomes anxious about having their blood pressure taken by a doctor, and so it pushes up their blood pressure and gives a false reading. Now it is revealed that many patients may have been given unnecessary drugs due to these false readings . Previous studies have suggested any health professional can trigger the nervousness that sends blood pressure shooting up. But . the first thorough analysis of scientific data has revealed that . doctors routinely record levels significantly higher than those recorded . by nurses. The difference . could be enough to result in a patient being put on blood pressure drugs . for life when they don’t actually need them. The . threshold for diagnosing hypertension – the medical term for high blood . pressure – is defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 or more (the . top number), or a diastolic reading of 90 or more (the bottom number). The new review shows these readings when taken by doctors are higher – by 7 and 4 respectively – than when taken by nurses. Drugs . are normally offered at higher readings than the threshold, but the . ‘white coat’ difference could result in a prescription, according to . study leader Christopher Clark, of the University of Exeter Medical . School. Blood pressure is the flow of blood through the arteries and blood vessels, and high blood pressure can be an exacerbating factor a medley of different conditions, including heart disease and diabetes . ‘Doctors should . continue to measure blood pressure as part of the assessment of an ill . patient or a routine check-up, but not where clinical decisions on blood . pressure treatment depend on the outcome,’ he said. ‘The . difference we noted is enough to tip some patients over the threshold . for treatment for high blood pressure, and unnecessary medication can . lead to unwanted side-effects. ‘Some patients may be erroneously asked to continue to monitor their own blood pressure at home, which can build anxiety. ‘These . inappropriate measures could all be avoided by the simple measure of . someone other than a doctor taking the blood pressure recording.’ The . research team examined the blood pressure levels of 1,019 individuals . whose measurements had been taken by both doctors and nurses at the same . visit. The review was published in the British Journal of General Practice. Dr . Clark added: ‘Our results were pooled from different settings across . ten countries, so we can be confident that they can be generalised to . any healthcare environment where blood pressure is being measured. ‘These results were all from research trials – our next task will be to examine data from GP surgeries.’ He . said the findings raised issues about how studies are carried out that . compare treatment by doctors and nurses: ‘Some studies have concluded . that nurses are better at treating hypertension, when in fact those . findings could be down to this recording bias.’ In . the UK 12million people have high blood pressure, 5.7million of whom . are undiagnosed. It is estimated it costs the NHS £1billion per year in . drugs alone. Maureen Talbot, . senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘If we feel . anxious during blood pressure measurement this can bump up our results. ‘Measuring . blood pressure regularly over 24 hours gives a far more accurate . reading and reduces the risk of unnecessary treatment.’ A cross section of a blood vessel exhibiting hypertension, or high blood pressure. The vessel is constricted, and this means that it is likely to cause the heart to have to pump harder to get the blood through, causing higher pressure in the blood vessels . Put in scientific terms, blood pressure a measurement of the arterial pressure of blood circulation. Smaller and more constricted arteries and veins mean that blood has to flow through a smaller area when it is being pumped around the body, which makes the heart pump a lot faster. This is known as high blood pressure, or hypertension, and is like water flowing through a shallow river. Low blood pressure is caused by more expansive, looser blood vessels, meaning that the same amount of blood has to flow through a much larger area, causing it to flow a lot slower. This is called low blood pressure or hypotension. Blood pressure is measured by taking a reading from a person's upper arm, measuring the pressure of the brachial artery, a major artery in the arm. The measurement is usually shown in terms of systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury (show as mm Hg). A healthy person's blood pressure will measure at around 98/69 mm Hg. A person with high blood pressure will measure at 169/105 mm Hg, and a person with low blood pressure will measure at around 85/50 mm Hg. Blood pressure affects the whole body, and is a risk factor in health problems like heart disease. High blood pressure can be caused by a fatty diet as cholesterol will block up ordinarily normal sized blood vessels, which means the heart has to pump harder, leading to a higher pressure in key arteries.","False blood pressure readings can be caused by 'white coat' phenomenon .

Inside one of the converted shipping containers which were opened last week by the Brighton Housing Trust . Retailer Homebase, which has used shipping containers in its adverts, has provided starter packs for the 36 residents . The packs include beds, wardrobes, chests of drawers, bedside cabinets and kitchen and other household equipment. Graham Heald, Homebase retail and distribution director, said: 'We are delighted to be supporting this creative initiative, which is supporting the local community with short-term, affordable accommodation. 'Although this isn’t a long term solution for homelessness, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a home they love, and so we’re providing starter packs to each tenant which enables them to do just that. The structures were designed for a social housing project in Amsterdam two years ago but the scheme had to be abandoned after hitting funding difficulties . 'By providing furniture, tenants will have a ready-made home waiting for them to move into, that will provide a comfortable and stable environment in their day to day lives.' In October, MailOnline reported how shipping containers from China, transformed into studio apartments, were being billed as a solution to London's housing crisis. Planning permission has been granted to the Forest Young Man's Christian Association (YMCA) to establish two sites featuring the containers in Waltham Forest, north-east London. The 'mYPads' - which cost £20,000 each - are designed to allow young people to have their own rental accommodation but at a price that allows them to save up for a deposit. Forward-thinking architects have come up with a new way to solve the UK's chronic housing shortage - converting garages into tiny homes. A row of out-of-use lock-ups on a council estate are due to be turned into cosy bedsits for young professionals and people unable to find a home. Tenants will have to pay just £11 a week for the mini houses, which are set to cost around £13,000 to convert. Earlier this year an architecture firm unveiled plans to convert disused garages into a row of miniature homes . The designs were inspired by a row of garages which have been standing unused on the Lockner Estate in Dalston, East London. Architecture firm Levitt Bernstein has proposed to set up its 'pop-up' homes in spaces like the garages which are awaiting permanent redevelopment. Each home will measure 11.5 square metres, and contain a bed, kitchen and bathroom, with room for a small table and two chairs. Every fifth garage is set to be turned into a communal area, with a laundry, extra kitchen equipment and a dining space. The homes will be built off-site and assembled by apprentices - and if the site is redeveloped, existing units can be dismantled and used elsewhere. Now: The garages are currently standing unused on the Lockner Estate in Dalston, East London . The project is known as Pop-up HAWSE - standing for Homes through Apprenticeships With Skills for Employment. It was the winner of a housing design competition organised by the Building Trust, a charity which aims to encourage sustainable architecture in deprived areas. If it is successful, the scheme will be expanded to other parts of London and throughout the UK, concentrating on areas where there are lots of homeless people or a shortage of housing for the young. The architects are already in talks with a number of local authorities in hope of launching similar schemes.","Brighton Housing Trust has opened 36 containers as self-contained studio flats in bid to help the city's homeless .

"By . Dan Bloom . A businessman who stabbed his wife to death after she mocked the size of his manhood has been jailed for 14 years. John Clinton's 24-year relationship with Paula, 48, broke down with her taunting him about his small manhood and wetting the bed after drinking, a court heard. In a 'horrific' attack he stabbed more than 10 times in the eye, back and chest before she fled into the street, collapsed and died. He then slashed his own throat and wrists in an suicide attempt. Tragic: John Clinton (left) stabbed to death his 48-year-old wife Paula (right) after an argument at their home in Aintree, Liverpool, in which he claimed she had mocked the size of his manhood and his bed-wetting . A court cleared him of murder and accepted his guilty plea to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after hearing he was suffering from a depressive illness. After studying a psychiatric report, Judge Mark Brown told 51-year-old he could not rule that he was dangerous to the public. But he told father-of-two Clinton he still bore 'a heavy responsibility' for the death of his wife. 'During . the attack you prodded her in the breast and upper abdomen with a knife . blade, stabbed her twice more to the eye and stabbed her eight times in . the back,' he said. 'There were four penetrating stab wounds to the back, two of those penetrating into the right lung. 'This must have been an horrific ordeal for your wife and you let her die in the street outside.' Liverpool Crown Court heard that the couple's marriage was breaking down when Clinton stabbed his wife at their home in Aintree, Merseyside, in November 2012. Tragic: The crime happened at the couple's home in Aintree, Merseyside (general view of their street pictured) Paula had wanted to leave him after he refused to quit drinking, and was on the phone to an independent financial advisor when they began arguing. Just weeks earlier she had told friends during a holiday that she did not want to return to her husband. Clinton put his hands over her mouth to stifle her screams, then grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stabbed her in the face and chest. Armed police went into the marital home and found he had cut his throat and wrists in a serious suicide attempt. However, medics successfully treated him in hospital. Clinton claimed during the row she had taunted him, as she had on earlier occasions, about his small manhood and his bed-wetting after drinking. Judge Brown said Clinton was suffering from a depressive illness at the time and was self-medicating with alcohol. Judge Mark Brown at Liverpool Crown Court told Clinton: 'This is on any view a sad and tragic case but there is no getting away from the fact you killed your wife in terrible circumstances' 'This is on any view a sad and tragic case but there is no getting away from the fact you killed your wife in terrible circumstances,' he added. 'Despite diminished responsibility you still bear a heavy responsibility for her death. 'Paula was 48 years old at the time of her death and it is likely she would have had many years of life ahead of her. 'You deprived her of those and deprived her family and friends of the love and affection she would have given them. 'It is particularly poignant that only a few weeks before the killing when she was on holiday with friends she told them that she didn't want to go home.'","John Clinton, 51, had depression when marriage to Paula, 48, broke down .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . and Fiona Macrae . Caffeine consumption in drinks such as cola and coffee plus energy drinks could slow down brain development in teenagers, Swiss scientists said . Caffeine-laden fizzy drinks could be stopping children’s brains from developing properly, scientists have warned. They believe that by preventing deep sleep, caffeine interferes with the development of the brain during adolescence. This is a critical time for the brain, when problems in development can lead to schizophrenia, anxiety, drug use and personality disorders. Researchers experimented on rats, but say the findings raise concerns for children and teenagers, some of whom consume large amounts of caffeine from colas and energy drinks. Between 300 and 400mg of caffeine – four cans of energy drink a day or three or four mugs of coffee – could make a difference, the study suggests. A can of the popular energy drink Red Bull, for example, contains 80mg. The Swiss research focused on the development of the brain during the teenage years. As it prepares for the demands of adulthood, synapses, or connections between cells, that are not needed are eliminated. It is thought that sleep is crucial to this process. Professor Reto Huber, of the University Children’s Hospital in Zurich, said: ‘This optimisation presumably occurs during deep sleep. ‘Key synapses extend, others are reduced; this makes the network more efficient and more powerful.’ Children and young adults guzzling the equivalent of three cups of coffee - three cans of energy drink or approximately a large bottle of cola -could be unconsciously reducing the amount of deep sleep they enjoy, thereby slowing their brain development . Prof Huber said that when young rats . were given caffeinated drinking water, they got less deep sleep than . those who drank plain water. Their . brains also had more connections in them at the end of the study – . meaning the pruning back process had been disturbed, the journal PLoS . ONE reports. A spokesman for . the researchers said: ‘Children’s and young adults’ average caffeine . consumption has increased by more than 70 per cent over the past 30 . years and an end to this is not in sight. ‘The drinks industry is posting its fastest-growing sales in the segment of caffeine-laden energy drinks. ‘The brain goes through a delicate maturing phase in puberty, during which many mental diseases can break out. 'And . even if the rat brain differs clearly from that of humans, the many . parallels in how brains develop raise the question as to whether . children’s and young adults’ caffeine intake is really harmless or . whether it might be wiser to abstain from consuming the pick-me-up.’ Another recent study suggested sugar-laden fizzy drinks made children as young as five violent, withdrawn and distracted. A study by the government regulatory agency Health Canada concluded that the average person can have up to 400mg of caffeine a day without experiencing negative affect, such as anxiety or heart problems. Here is the caffeine content of a number of popular drinks . A recent study found a large cup of Starbucks coffee contains more than three quarters of a person's 'safe' daily dose of caffeine. The 16oz 'Grande' coffee is said to contain nearly double the recommended limit for a pregnant woman, while a typical home-made 8oz cup of coffee is well above a 10-year-old's daily allowance. But scientists stress that such statistical averages can vary widely from person to person, with factors such as gender and genetics having an impact on tolerance levels. A person's tolerance can also be affected by other drug use, with women who take the contraceptive pill breaking down caffeine slower, and smokers process the stimulant faster than non-smokers. A study by the government regulatory agency Health Canada concluded that the average person can have up to 400mg of caffeine a day without experiencing negative affect, such as anxiety or heart problems. The average allowance for a pregnant woman is 200mg, according to the Food Standards Agency, and 75mg for a 10-year-old. A 16oz Starbucks coffee has 330mg of caffeine, according to a table compiled by Chemical and Engineering News but the coffee chain denied the findings, saying their Grande contains 140mg of caffeine. University of Florida's director of forensic toxicology, Bruce A. Goldberger, told Chemical and Engineering News: 'People often don’t understand the potential risk of these beverages. 'Caffeine is a stimulant and, when consumed at high enough levels, can have negative effects.' A fatal dose of caffeine is thought to be around 10g - equivalent to around 75 8oz cups of coffee or 120 cans of red bull consumed within a few hours.","Swiss Scientists say teens drinking three cans of energy drink or a large bottle of cola every day could be reducing the amount of deep sleep they get .

The imposing 6x4ft film hoarding, showing star Naomi Watts in character as Diana, Princess Of Wales, appeared on a billboard advertising sign next to the Pont de l'Alma in Paris over the weekend. Yards away stands the iconic gold-leafed Flame of Liberty which became her unofficial memorial in the wake of her death on which 'Diana pilgrims' continue to scrawl messages in her memory.

"By . Helen Collis . The incredible moment a fisherman whooped for joy after freeing an enormous endangered whale that became trapped in heavy lines, has been caught on film. Adrian Colaprete jumped in the water armed with a long knife and a Go Pro camera initially to assess the situation. But as the giant whale loomed towards him, and a window to free the animal was presented, he reached out and sliced through the heavy rope, before the creature dived deep. Scroll down for video... Tangled: The giant right whale with a heavy fishing rope hooked around it was eventually freed by a brave fisherman armed with a knife . Adrian Coleprete jumped into the water in front of the whale and waiting for it to come up for air . Ecstatic Mr Colaprete afterwards said 'it just felt right' and described the moment as one of the best in his life. Speaking to Pilot Online, Mr Colaprete said: 'Being part of it was something bigger than me.' Joined . by two friends, the men were out fishing on a Foster's charter boat, . based in Rudee Inlet, Virgina, and were about 50 miles off Virginia . Beach coast when they had the extraordinary encounter. In an interview with the news service, Pat Foster said he was first to spot the animal when they were fishing on Friday. Looming: As the enormous 50ft creature surfaced Mr Colaprete said he felt 'scared' As the whale reached him, the rope was clearly visible and the animal appeared to slow down . It wasn't 'uncommon' he said to see whales in the area, but when he realised it was a right whale his interest was piqued. Right whales are rarely seen since they were hunted almost to extinction in the 19th century. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there are thought to be only 400 in existence. As he watched the whale, he also realised there was a problem with some fishing gear, since two poly balls were being dragged close to each other; 'that spells trouble in our field,' he said. Realising the whale was still close by, they turned the boat around and followed it, and saw that the heavy lines were tangled around its body. Mr Foster said they watched the whale's pattern of coming up for air and then his friend Mr Colaprete jumped in. 'I told him to be careful, it's a very large animal, we don't want whatever's entangled, if it was entangled, to get around him,' he told the news service. Last moments of being trapped: The diver then reached forward and can be heard struggling to cut the rope before the whale is seen swimming away . Goodbye: The diver surfaces just in time to see the whale's tail before it dived down deep . At first Mr Colaprete couldn't see the whale, since he had jumped in in front of it. Then he saw it looming out from the depths, 'almost like a submarine coming at me,' he said. 'It was kind of scary at first,' he told the Pilot Online. But as the whale's eyes came in line with his, the creature incredibly slowed, he said, allowing him time to reach forward and cut the rope as it passed. Immediately, the pressure of the rope was released, and the tackle fell down into the depths. 'Extraordinary': Diver Mr Colaprete described the moment as one of he best in his life . Surfacing with the camera, Mr Colaprete caught a final glimpse of the endangered whale's tail before it submerged into the deep. Although he said he realised he could have been in danger, Mr Colaprete told the news service the moment felt right so he went for it. Pilot Online points out that people are supposed to get authorization from the National Marine Fisheries Service, to free a tangled whale, and to notify the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.","Adrian Colaprete dived in armed with a knife and camera to asses .

"By . Damien Gayle . Google has been told to inform its French customers that it must pay a £125,000 fine for violating their privacy. France's data protection watchdog punished the online advertising giant for the way it tracks and stores users' personal information. The fine is just the latest blow for Google in France, after the company was earlier this week hit with a €1billion tax bill from French tax authorities. Communique: Google has been told to inform . French customers it must pay a £125,000 fine for violating their privacy . after France's data watchdog punished the firm over how it tracks and . stores personal information . Privacy watchdog CNIL objected to Google's method . of combining data collected on individual users across services such as . YouTube, Gmail and social network Google+. Google began moving toward the new storage model in March 2012 and combined 60 privacy policies into one, which was forced on users with no means to opt out. The Silicon Valley firm - which has been heavily implicated in Edward Snowden's leaks about American and British online spying - said it would comply with CNIL's order but would keep fighting the €150,000 (£125,000; $204,000) fine issued last month. Google last month appealed the watchdog's fine as well as the order to post a notice of the sanction on its google.fr homepage for 48 hours. Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt: The fine . comes after raids on Google's Paris offices led to officials slapping . the firm with a 1billion-euro tax bill . Lawyers for the multi billion-dollar company specifically asked the Conseil d'Etat (Council of State), France's top administrative court, to suspend the order while it re-examines the case. But judges ruled yesterday that there was not enough urgency nor proof of damage to Google's reputation to warrant a suspension. The fine and order come after raids on Google's Paris offices led to the company being slapped with a €1billion (£830million; $1.36billion) tax claim. French financial inspectors searched the search engine's offices in June 2011 as part of an investigation into its accounting. The company had sought to reduce the amount of tax it pays in France by channelling its revenue through a Dutch-registered intermediary and then to a Bermuda-registered holding, Google Ireland Limited, before reporting it in low-tax Ireland. Socialist France is currently one of the highest taxed countries in the world. Commenting on yesterday's privacy ruling, a Google spokesman told Reuters: 'We've engaged fully with the CNIL throughout this process to explain our privacy policy and how it allows us to create simpler, more effective services. 'We will comply with the order to post the notice, but we'll also continue with our appeal before the Conseil d'Etat.' Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain have also opened similar cases against Google, arguing that the company's privacy policy breached local laws on protecting citizens' personal data.","Online ads giant rapped for the way it stores and tracks personal data .

"By . Daniel Miller . An investigation has been launched after millions of dead shrimp were washed ashore close to two coal-fired power stations on the coast of Chile, turning the beach bright red. Environmental officials say they are investigating after dead the creatures appeared on a beach in the town of Coronel, some 330 miles south of the capital, Santiago. Local fishermen have blamed the Bocamina 1 and 2 plants owned by regional power generator Endesa, and the Santa Maria plant controlled by Chilean power company Colbun, which they say have heated the waters, endangering their livelihood. Mystery: Washed-up shrimps turn the beach red at 'Caleta Rojas' in the twon of Coronel town, some 540 km southwest of Santiago . A local shows a handful of the shrimps washed ashore. Fishermen say a nearby power station has heated the water and may be the cause of the disaster . 'I'm 69 years old and started fishing when I was nine but, as a fisherman, I never saw a disaster of this magnitude,' Gregorio Ortega told local Radio Bio Bio. Hundreds of dead crabs also washed up in the same area over the weekend. 'We're going to be collecting as much evidence as possible to determine if this is an environmental crime,' Ana Maria Aldana, prosecutor for environmental crimes, told state television. Examination: Men sift through some of the shrimps washed ashore which many believe was due to water  released form the thermoelectric plants located nearby . A local man piles up many of the shrimp that were washed ashore next to a thermoelectric powerstation in Chile . An official at Colbun declined to comment. A spokesman for Endesa said the company was aware of the issue and would issue a statement later.Chile's energy intensive mining industry is clamouring for more power. Some analysts say the country must triple its capacity in just 15 years, despite having no domestic oil or natural gas. Chile imports 97 per cent of its fossil fuels and depends largely on hydropower for electricity, creating a crisis when droughts drain reservoirs or far-away disputes affect fuel imports. Most Chileans oppose plans to develop a project to power central Chile by damming Patagonian rivers, fearing environmental damage. The HidroAysen venture is 51per cent owned by Endesa and 49 per cent owned by Colbun. Some protests against the project have turned violent.","Officials investigating after creatures appeared on beach in the town of Coronel, 330 miles south of Santiago .

"By . James Chapman . Working parents earning up to £150,000 each are to get childcare tax breaks worth as much as £1,200 a year per child. Chancellor George Osborne will unveil a long-awaited £1bn scheme that will mean all but the best-off benefiting from tax relief, despite Nick Clegg’s insistence last month that the scheme would be ‘targeted’. But the move will only apply to couples where both parents are working, or single parents who are employed – likely to spark a backlash from stay-at-home mothers and traditionalist Tory MPs who argue it discriminates against women. Well off: Working parents earning up to £150,000 are to get childcare tax breaks worth as much as £1,200 a year per child . Officials from the Treasury suggested there was not enough money to support all families with child care. The document says: 'We need to focus our resources. Working families who are struggling with their childcare costs or families where parents wants to go to work but can’t afford to, are in greater need of state support for childcare than families where one parent chooses to stay home and look after their children full time.' David Cameron believes the cost of childcare has become the number one cost of living issue for working couples. Childcare costs in Britain amount to 43 per cent of average incomes, compared with only 14.8 per cent in France, 9.1 per cent in Germany and 8.4 per cent in Denmark, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As a result, the Government believes a million women who want to work are missing from the workforce, put off by high fees for nurseries or childminders. The scheme, to be unveiled in the Budget tomorrow, will ultimately benefit around 2.5million working families. Around £1billion has been set aside to fund it, though details of where the money is coming from will be announced by Mr Osborne in his Commons statement. Scheme: George Osborne will announce that all but the best-off benefit from tax relief . They will be offered a tax-free . childcare scheme worth up to £1,200 per child. This will save a typical . working family with two children under 12 up to £2,400 a year. The . scheme will be phased in from 2015 and for the first year will be open . to 1.3million families with children under the age of five. The scheme will build up over time to include children under 12, as existing workplace childcare vouchers, currently subsidised by the taxpayer, are closed to new claimants from 2015 and phased out. To be eligible, families will have both parents or a single parent in work, with each earning less than £150,000 a year, and will not already receive support through tax credits or the new universal credit. David Cameron said those who work hard must be helped . They will receive 20 per cent – equivalent to the basic rate of tax – of their yearly childcare costs, up to a total of £6,000 per child. For a family with two children, the new offer will be worth more than double the amount of a single claim for workplace childcare vouchers. It will be open to around five times as many families. The Prime Minister said: ‘If Britain is going to succeed in the global race we must help those who work hard and want to get on. ‘Too many families find paying for childcare tough and are often stopped from working the hours they’d like. That is why we are introducing tax free-childcare, saving a typical family with two children up to £2,400 a year. ‘This is a boost direct to the pockets of hard-working families in what will be one of the biggest measures ever introduced to help parents with childcare costs.’ Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said an extra £200million of support will be provided within universal credit to help poorer families. Details of the scheme will be finalised after a consultation, but it is expected that parents will be able to open an online childcare voucher account and have their payments topped up by Government. The scheme comes on top of government support already announced, including extending the free entitlement to provide 15 hours a week of free early education and childcare for all three and four-year-olds and extending 15 hours of free childcare a week to 40 per cent of two-year-olds from 2014-15. Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg said: ‘Parents will be disappointed that they will not get any help with childcare costs for another two and a half years.’ The Child Poverty Action Group said the new scheme was 'massively complicated, poorly targeted and too many years away to provide comfort for families struggling right now', as well as being 'weighted heavily in favour of those on high incomes'. The charity Working Families raised concerns that - unlike the ESC vouchers - the new system will provide no help for couples where one partner is studying or retraining or has been made redundant and is looking for work. 'It is important that families in these situations don't lose out, and that support is available to those trying to get back into work,' said chief executive Sarah Jackson. The disposable income of an average family is twice what it was in the late 1970s, official figures showed yesterday. But the report reveals that the rise is not down to significant tax cuts, as the taxman’s share of middle-class incomes has hardly changed over the past 35 years. The disposable income after taxes and benefits of a middle-earning and working age household is currently £29,900, according to the analysis from the Office for National Statistics. This is a fall from a peak of £31,100 in 2007, before the recession eroded the earnings of middle Britain. But back in 1977, the era of union barons and near national bankruptcy, the average disposable income was half this level when calculated at today’s prices – £15,500. The proportion the Treasury takes from the average income in tax has hardly changed. Instead the state has continued to demand virtually the same share of middle incomes – around a third. This means that, in real cash terms, governments have taken increasing amounts from families. The ONS report says that, at current prices, the taxman was grabbing a little over £8,000 a year from an average income family in 1977, but £14,464 out of their income in 2007, and £12,654 now.","Working parents get tax break of up to £1,200 to maximum of 20pc of costs .

"By . Amanda Williams . They are completely free of two of the most debilitating illnesses - diabetes and cancer. Now scientists hope a community of dwarfs living in a remote corner of Ecuador could hold the key to a cure for both. The Laron dwarfs, who have a condition believed to be caused by inbreeding, appear to be completely immune to cancer and other age and lifestyle associated diseases. People who inherit the genetic defect are in perfect proportion but grow only to an average height of 4ft. For more than 24 years, endocrinologists Jaime Guevara-Aguirre (top left) and Arlan Rosenbloom (top right) have tracked a population of Ecuadorians dwarves who seem to be immune to cancer . Jaime Guevara-Aguirre (pictured in 2009 with some participants in his research) was the first to identify a population of Ecuadorians with Laron syndrome . Now scientists are developing a drug which they hope will do artificially what the genetic defect in Laron syndrome does naturally -  protect against DNA damage that fuels cancer growth. There are around 300 people in the world with the condition Laron dwarfism, a third of whom live in remote villages in Ecuador’s southern Loja province. Sufferers of Laron lack a hormone called Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, or IGF-1. It is IGF-1, not growth hormone, that stimulates the cell to grow and . divide to form new cells. In ordinary humans, too much of the hormone can lead a person . to develop breast, prostate or bowel cancers at an early age, Discovery Magazine reports. Studies of the Laron group showed that  while they had high levels of growth hormone, their . cells were not generating IGF-1. An Ecuadorian man with Laron syndrome (pictured with his children in the early 1990s). He lived free of cancer and diabetes to 87, a decade longer than the average Ecuadorian. He was killed in a car accident in 2012 . Dr Jaime Guevara-Aguirre, a hormone expert from the Ecuadorian Institute . of Endocrinology, and Dr Valter Longo at the University of Southern California have been studying the Laron group for the best part of two decades. They believe that having less IGF1 could mean suffering less of the DNA . damage that occurs in all of us when we age and which leads to cancer. They are also studying whether the Laron dwarfs could hold the key for the prevention of diabetes, as despite a tendency to obesity due to overeating and a poor diet, it is another condition to which they appear immune. Guevara-Aguirre was inspired to study Laron syndrome after growing up in the Loja province in southern Ecuador, where he often saw short people known locally as pigmeitos - loosely translates as pygmies - living in small towns . He told Discovery Magazine: 'I had seen maybe 20 of them on the streets when I was young.' Enlisting the help of a family acquaintance Guevara-Aguirre, visited the provinces of southern Ecuador, not too far from where he had spent parts of his childhood, to find more. He met with families, asked questions, and took blood samples, discovering more and more cases each week . By late 1989, they had enough cases— 20 total, 19 of them women—to publish an article on the 'Little Women of Loja' in NEJM, which recognised the growth hormone deficiency in the inbred people. But it is Dr Longo who has taken the first step into developing anticancer and antiaging drugs with  lessons learned from Laron syndrome. In 2008 he founded DSR Pharmaceuticals with the aim of developing a pill that blocks the growth hormone receptor. It is hoped the drug will do artificially what the genetic defect in Laron syndrome does naturally - protect against DNA damage that fuels cancer growth. A more expensive injection form of the drug was discovered a decade ago. It has since been approved by the regulatory body the Food and Drug Association to treat individuals with acromegaly, a condition in which there is too much growth hormone in adults, resulting in abnormal growth of body tissues, especially hands, feet, and face. Now Longo believes that it might also be useful in the treatment of cancer. In the late 1950s, Israeli . endocrinologist Zvi Laron began studying patients, some with childhood diabetes and others with growth and sexual . development disorders. His earliest patients included three . young siblings—two boys and a girl— all with severely stunted growth. They were all obese, with thin hair, pronounced foreheads, and a collapsed nasal bridge, and their grandparents were first . cousins. Laron assumed they had a severe shortage of growth hormone, but some years later, after new blood tests were developed, it transpired the levels of growth . hormone were abnormal—they were extremely high. By the mid-1960s he had identified 20 more such people. He reasoned that either they had . defective hormones, or something was wrong with the . cells that respond to those hormones. Every cell in the body contains . receptors, which act like tiny locks for hormones, Discover Magazine reports. When a hormone finds a matching . lock, it binds to the receptor and triggers the cell to do something, . such as grow or divide. But while studying the cells of his subjects, Laron found that normal growth hormone failed to . bind to its associated receptor, suggesting that they were . damaged. In 1984, he published a paper showing that the short stature of . people with Laron syndrome results from their inability to respond to . growth hormone, no matter how much they have floating around.","Laron dwarfs seem to be immune to cancer and other diseases .

Aspiring doctor Paul Crawford, 32, was locked in a bitter legal battle with Newcastle University after he failed the final year of his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree.

But now he could be held liable for a legal bill totalling £90,000 after his case was thrown out by the UK's top judges. Last night Mr Crawford's barrister, Antony Speaight QC, said his client had originally been granted a judicial review after judges sympathised with Mr Crawford's claim that academics had failed to properly mark his work. In a statement he said: 'It is an unfortunate outcome for a young man who had spent six years training to be a doctor and at one time or another passed every element in the medical examinations.' Mr Crawford, who is originally from Kilburn, London, but now lives in Australia, began his studies on Tyneside in October 2005 and completed the first four stages of his degree with no problems. But in 2010 he failed the final year and was forced to re-sit the year. In October 2011 he was awarded a B grade, which is a borderline fail, in the 'Clinical and Communication Skills' domain and was once again told he had failed. Instead of making alternative life plans, the talented sportsman - who was a member of the university's basketball and hockey team - opted to launch legal action against the university and was granted a judicial review in the UK's top court. Mr Crawford - whose brother Jack Crawford became one of the first British players to join an NFL American football club in the USA in 2012 - made a string of appeals internally and to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education. Study: Mr Crawford failed the final year of his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree by a single mark at Newcastle University - pictured . He was told he could not complete his registration with the General Medical Council because he had not obtained the correct grades. Deputy High Court Judge Andrew Grubb upheld Newcastle University's denial they had strayed from the marking procedures in its published handbook. A Newcastle University spokesman declined to comment until the conclusion of a hearing to determine costs which is due to take place later this month. Mr Speaight said: 'The judge found that the university had failed to give Mr Crawford a fair hearing under its own internal appeals procedure, the rules of which it had broken. 'However, the ultimately critical question was whether the university had departed from its own published handbook in the manner in which it computed Mr Crawford's marks. 'At an earlier hearing a different judge was sympathetic to Mr Crawford's argument that double weighting one of the components of a practical exam was inconsistent with the calculation of an average. 'However, at this hearing the judge held that the handbook gave merely an overview, and that the double weighting was not inconsistent with its text.'","Paul Crawford, 32, was locked in a legal battle with Newcastle University .

"By . Becky Evans . The Texas fertilizer plant that exploded last week killing 14 people last had a full safety inspection almost 30 years ago. The United States Department of Labor website said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) visited West Chemical and Fertilizer Company in February 1985. The revelation comes amid growing concern about how health and safety rules were followed at the plant, which supplied agricultural chemicals and fertilizer to area farmers. West Chemical and Fertilizer Plant, that exploded on Wednesday killing 14 and injuring 200, was last inspected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 1985 . The explosion destroyed this apartment complex as well as damaged schools and a nursing home . Workers are pictured among the debris of the plant. The cause of the explosion has still not been determined . Volunteer firefighters and paramedics were among 14 people who died on Wednesday when the blast flattened the fertilizer plant. Two hundred people were also injured . in the explosion that destroyed a 50-unit apartment block, about 50 . houses and damaged several schools and a nursing home. The cause of the explosion has not yet . been determined, although the facility stored liquid anhydrous ammonia . fertilizer in huge tanks and ammonium nitrate in dry form. Both are considered hazardous materials that could ignite under certain conditions. Records reviewed by The Associated Press show that in OSHA last inspected the West Chemical & Fertilizer Co., as it was known at the time, in 1985. It then fined the company $30 for a serious violation for storage of anhydrous ammonia. OSHA cited the plant for four other serious violations of respiratory protection standards but did not issue fines. The maximum fine for a serious violation was $1,000. The agency has jurisdiction over more than 7million workplaces but it is not uncommon for some companies to go years without inspection. Reviews into the plant's documentation also found that last year it was storing 1,350 times the . amount of ammonium nitrate that would normally trigger safety oversight . by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. However, a source close to the agency . told Reuters that company owners did not tell them about the high levels . of the dangerous substance. 270 tons of ammonium nitrate - the same substance used by the Oklahoma bomber - was stored at the plant last year . Investigators are still probing the cause of the explosion as workers began to clear debris on Monday . Volunteers sort through goods donated for victims the explosion that has devastated the small community . Ammonium nitrate, which can be used in bomb making, is supposed to be tightly monitored. Yet, documents filed to the Texas . Department of State Health Services that showed the plant stored 270 . tons of the substance were not shared with the agency. Timothy McVeigh used two tons of ammonium nitrate in a truck bomb in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 . people and injuring more than 800. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a ranking member . of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said: 'It seems this . manufacturer was willfully off the grid. 'This facility was known to have . chemicals well above the threshold amount to be regulated under the . Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Act (CFATS), yet we . understand that DHS did not even know the plant existed until it blew . up.' Partial safety inspections of the fertilizer plant had been held since 1985 and in 2011 the company owners . filed an emergency response plan stating there was 'no' risk of fire or . explosion at the facility, according to the Huffington Post. The U.S. Department of Transportation . Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Commission fined West . Fertilizer plant owners $5,200 during a partial inspection in 2011. One of the violations was 'failing to . develop and adhere to a security plan' for the transportation of large . amounts of anhydrous ammonia. Last week, plant owner Donald Adair . released a statement saying that 'out of respect for the investigative . process' he and other bosses would restrict their public comments. Local media have not been able to contact him or manager Ted Uptmore in recent days. Churchgoers huddle to pray after a service for the First Baptist Church in a field on Sunday . Homes and cars were destroyed by the blast and some residents say they are frustrated they have not been able to return to their properties to check on the damage . Yesterday, the sole school that was not damaged in the deadly blast reopened. It is the only one of four schools in the small town that remained intact. 'It's the first step, but getting back . going again, some normalcy for our staff and faculty's lives and our . kids' lives, it's a huge milestone,' said Marty Crawford, West . Independent School District Superintendent. Over the weekend, volunteers built three temporary classrooms at the elementary school. Some residents said they are frustrated that they have not been allowed back to their homes to check on the damage. Bill Killough, 76, said he had . checkbooks, medication and guns sitting out where he had left them after . fleeing his home in a hurry. 'They don't care. Don't care. There's . no reason why they [federal authorities' can't escort residents in to . get their belongings', he said.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . The Duchess of Cambridge has become a prisoner of her 'maternal, doll-like' public image, a well-known classicist has claimed. Cambridge University classicist and TV presenter Mary Beard said that the Duchess of Cambridge has been reconstructed as an object of admiration following her 2011 marriage into the Royal family. This has seen the future Queen transformed from a Berkshire woman into a beautiful 'vessel', she said. 'Imprisoned' The Duchess of Cambridge has become a prisoner of her public image, Mary Beard has claimed . Reconstruction: Following her marriage into the Royal family, Kate Middleton (pictured right with baby George) has been transformed into a beautiful 'vessel' with 'maternal' and 'doll-like' features, says the classicist (left) '[Kate] has been constructed as this . admirable, maternal, doll-like, precious vessel,' Professor Beard told The Times. 'Who has done it? In part, she has constructed herself. In part, she has taken on a job, which has . its up sides and its down sides.' Kate - whose marriage to Prince William has seen her become one of the most famous women in the world - has become 'constantly reproduced' for the benefit of our beauty-obsessed society, she said. This is believed to have stemmed from centuries-old, sexist restrictions on women's roles in public life - with females previously seen as beautiful, domestic bodies. Rebelling: However, Professor Beard said the Duchess occasionally rebels against her public image - as can be seen in this photograph taken last year, which shows streaks of grey in Kate's usually immaculate tresses .

"By . Helen Pow . A mother thrown to her death from a Six Flags rollercoaster in July was sitting in a car operators knew to be faulty and wasn't properly restrained, according to a newly released police report. Rosa Ayala-Gaona Esparza, 52, was ejected from her seat in the Texas Giant in front of her mortified daughter at about 6:40 p.m. July 19. Her partially severed body was found wrapped around a support beam on the roof of the Honky Tonk tunnel, with blood and tissue scattered over a 75-foot area. According to The Houston Chronicle, the ride operator told Arlington Police Department investigators that he checked everyone's restraints before the train departed, but when it went by he remembered thinking the restraint wasn't all the way down on Esparza's thigh. The theme park has denied a mechanical fault was to blame for the accident. Tragic: Rosa Ayala-Gaona Esparza, 52, pictured, who was thrown to her death from a Six Flags rollercoaster in July was sitting in a car operators knew to be faulty and wasn't properly restrained, according to a newly released police report . However, the harness was down far enough for the computer to register it as locked. The police report also reveals that an investigator received an email from a woman who had ridden in car number 3, the car Esparza was riding in, the day before the fatal incident. The woman said she was riding at about 6:30 p.m. and after the train had loaded, the operator announced 'all clear' over the loud speaker. But he then immediately looked down and announced 'Check car 3.' She explained that one of the employees who had previously checked the restraints came back to her car and rechecked the restraint. Then came another 'all clear' announcement and the ride began. A witness riding in the fourth row, directly behind Esparza, corroborated the claim that her restraint was not properly latched. Faulty: The ride operator told Arlington Police Department investigators that he checked everyone's restraints before the train departed, but when it went by he remembered thinking the restraint wasn't all the way down on Esparza's thigh . He told police both he and his friend tried to help the woman when they saw her feet in the air but they couldn't reach her. Investigators interviewed 17 witnesses who either saw Esparza being flung from the car or only became aware of the tragedy after the ride came to a halt. The woman's daughter, who is suing the theme park, was riding in the car ahead of her mother with her husband and turned around early int he ride to see her mother almost completely upside down in the car with her head at the floor. As the ride began its third ascent, she saw her mother being tossed out of the car but didn't see her hit anything, the report states. The daughter was then forced to endure the rest of the ride, not knowing her mother's fate. It took fire fighters an hour to remove Esparza's body from the aluminum roof. 'The decedent's body was partially wrapped around support beam #471, with her lower body on top of the roof and her nearly severed upper body hanging over the south side of the roof,' one of the reports states, according to the Chronicle. Reopened: The Texas Giant roller coaster ride in Six Flags Over Texas, pictured, reopened in September . In a statement to the newspaper on . Monday, Six Flags said, 'Our hearts remain heavy about this accident and . our sincerest condolences go out to Ms. Esparza's family.' The theme park denies all allegations that it was at fault. In . October, Six Flags said in court documents that it was not responsible . for the death because it was not the manufacturer or designer of the . Texas Giant ride. The theme . park filed its response on October 4 in district court in Tarrant . County to the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Esparza's family. The ride reopened in September. The company said it followed maintenance and inspection procedures recommended by manufacturer Gerstlauer Amusement Rides. It also pointed out that about 2.5 million people had been on the roller coaster before the incident. Six . Flags announced in September that the notorious 153-foot tall roller . coaster was to reopen with new seat belts and redesigned restraint bar . pads following an internal investigation. While the company maintains a . mechanical failure was not to blame for Esparza's tragic fall, her family have . accused the park of negligence and operating a faulty ride. The $1 million lawsuit, filed in September names Six Flags . Entertainment Corporation, Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc, Texas Flags, Ltd. and Six Flags Over Texas as defendants. Ominous: Witnesses said they heard Rosa Esparza complain about her harness before she fell . According to the suit, Esparza, who . also went by the surname Ayala-Gaona, was in the front left . seat of the train's second car behind her daughter and son-in-law. The . car had no seat belt or shoulder harness, only a single lap or 'T-bar' to restrain passengers, Star-Telegram reported. 'As the roller-coaster was in its first . large descent, Rosa Esparza's daughter heard screaming and yelling . behind her, and turned to see her mother in the process of being thrown . out of the car, out from behind the safety in her seat,' the suit . states. Esparza was then thrown against a support piling as the car twisted and turned, landing on the tunnel's roof. 'She was then catapulted many feet below . onto the metal roof of a tunnel,' the lawsuit states. Before the mother of two fell about . 75 feet, witnesses said she had complained her harness wasn't fastened securely. 'They didn't secure her right. One of . the employees from the park â€” one of the ladies â€” she asked her to . click her more than once, and they were like, 'As long you heard it . click, you're OK.' Everybody else is like, 'Click, click, click.' ' a . witness told The Dallas News. 'Hers . only clicked once. Hers was the only one that went down once, and she . didn't feel safe, but they let her still get on the ride.' Devastating: Esparza's family is suing Six Flags Over Texas for negligence after the tragic accident . The suit states Esparza's daughter and son-in-law were forced . to complete the ride for 'what seemed like an interminable time knowing . that Rosa Esparza had been thrown out of the ride and not knowing . whether she was dead or seriously injured and in need of immediate . medical attention'. It also claimed Six Flags employees initially refused to believe that Esparza had been thrown off the ride. 'It's a tragedy of the highest order,' Dallas attorney Frank Branson, who filed the suit on the family's behalf, told Star-Telegram. 'I believe it should have been . avoided and could have been avoided.' Following a nearly two-month investigation by the . 'ride train manufacturer, internal engineers and external experts', the . Texas Department of Insurance gave the park approval to start up the . ride again. Six Flags officials said it has now added 'incremental and overlapping safety measures' to the ride, including re-designed . restraint-bar pads from the manufacturer and new seat belts. The park is also now providing a coaster ride seat at the entrance to allow guests . with 'unique body shapes and sizes' to see if they fit in the restraint. Flung: The mother fell 75-feet from the fast-moving rollercoaster, pictured in action . 'We are heartbroken and will forever . feel the pain and sadness of this tragic accident,' Steve . Martindale, president of Six Flags Over Texas, said. 'The safety of our guests . and employees is our company's absolute highest priority and we try to . take every reasonable precaution to eliminate the risk of accidents.' Martindale and his family were among the first riders when it reopened in September. The Esparza family's suit says Six Flags . operators have known for decades the extreme dangers posed by . such rides. This was the park's second fatality. In 1999, a 28-year-old Arkansas woman . died and 10 others were injured when a boat capsized on the Roaring . Rapids ride. In 2006, . nine park patrons were injured on the Texas Tornado when one of the . mechanical bearings that spins the ride malfunctioned. 'More often than not, the response of . the Six Flags defendants to roller-coaster tragedies at their parks has . been merely to feign surprise and to belatedly add safety belts in an . attempt to calm the public's fears,' the lawsuit states. Star-Telegram also reports the suit states that inspections done on . the roller coasters since Esparza's death 'showed that various parts of . the security systems on the ride were experiencing inconsistencies and . intermittent failures.' 'In addition, Six Flags has now admitted . that, after these inspections, they replaced a 'limit switch' for a . restraint in the very car in which Rosa was riding because Six Flags . found the switch to be defective,' the suit states.","Dallas, Texas mother Rosa Esparza, 52, was ejected from her seat in the Texas Giant in front of her mortified daughter on July 19 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Immigration Minister sensationally quit last night for employing a Colombian cleaner who was in the country illegally – and he may now be hit with a £5,000 fine. Mark Harper – tipped to be a future Prime Minister – said he had offered his resignation because he had failed to carry out checks that would have established she was in the UK unlawfully. He now faces a fine for not keeping copies of the immigration papers shown to him by the cleaner. Commons records show that the unidentified cleaner, who is now subject to ‘enforcement action’ by border officials, received at least £2,000 from Mr Harper’s Westminster expenses before second home allowances were tightened up. Immigration Minister Mark Harper has been forced to resign after illegally employing a cleaner . The resignation triggered a mini-Government reshuffle, with a key promotion for Harriett Baldwin . Downing Street said David Cameron had . accepted Mr Harper’s resignation ‘with regret’ – adding that there was . ‘no suggestion’ the Tory MP had ‘knowingly employed an illegal . immigrant’. Mr Harper’s . resignation triggered a mini-Government reshuffle, with a key promotion . for Harriett Baldwin, one of George Osborne’s key allies. Mrs Baldwin, . 53, becomes an Assistant Whip. Fellow Conservative James Brokenshire was . appointed as the new Immigration Minister. Mr . Harper, 43, who was ranked second only to Home Secretary Theresa May in . the Home Office pecking order, first employed the cleaner at his South . London second home in April 2007. At the time, he had been the MP for . Forest of Dean for two years. In . his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Harper said he had . been ‘mindful’ of his obligation to make checks including ‘her right to . work in the UK’. He made a . copy of both her passport, to establish her identity, and a Home Office . letter she handed him which stated that she had leave to remain . indefinitely in the country. Government . sources said yesterday that as it was a ‘live operational matter’ they . could not say about how the cleaner came to be in possession of a letter . that gave false details about her right to be in the country. Controversial: Mr Harper was behind the Home Office's 'go home' vans, which were later deemed distasteful and withdrawn . However, . previous Home Office investigations have shown that illegal immigrants . can obtain fake passports – and supporting documentation – with relative . ease. When Mr Harper was . appointed as a Cabinet Office Minister after the 2010 Election he . ‘considered the issue’ of his cleaner’s immigration status, and . concluded that he had performed sufficient checks, he wrote in his . resignation letter. After . his promotion to Immigration Minister in September 2012, Mr Harper said, . he ‘went through a similar consideration process’ and decided against . carrying out any further checks. Given . the obvious sensitivity of his new position, Mr Harper said he now . accepted that he ‘should have checked more thoroughly’. He . told Mr Cameron that he only became aware of his cleaner’s illegal . status after he began piloting the Immigration Bill through Parliament . and became acutely aware of the need for employers to carry out . ‘reasonable checks’ on the status of their employees. Even . though ‘we do not require them to be experts or spot anything other . than an obvious forgery’, he told Mr Cameron that he ‘thought it prudent . to check that all my documents were in order for my cleaner’. The . unidentified Colombian woman provided new copies of the documents on . Tuesday. But when Mr Harper asked his private office to check the . details with immigration officials, he was told that she did not have . indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. Home Secretary Theresa May and Prime Minister David Cameron both praised Mr Harper's contribution to Government . ‘Although . I complied with the law at all times, I consider that as Immigration . Minister, who is taking legislation through Parliament which will . toughen up our immigration laws, I should hold myself to a higher . standard than expected of others,’ he said in a letter to the PM. In . his response, Mr Cameron wrote: ‘I am very sorry indeed to see you . leave the Government, but I understand your reasons for doing so. I hope . very much that you will be able to return to service on the Frontbench . before too long.’ Clean-cut Mr Harper, a prominent Eurosceptic, has been tipped for swift advancement since entering the Government. He . caused controversy last year when he rounded on a five times-failed . asylum seeker live on TV and demanded he go home, saying: ‘We don’t . believe you and neither did the judge,’ going on to say: ‘With the . greatest respect, when you were here claiming asylum, taxpayers . supported you. You now have no right to be in the United Kingdom and you . should return.’ He faced . anger for defending the controversial vans that toured London bearing . posters with the warning to illegal immigrants: ‘Go home or face . arrest.’ Mr Harper insisted he had done nothing illegal but that he 'had fallen below the standards expected of him'. He apologised to the Prime Minister for any 'embarrassment' caused . Mr Harper's resignation sees a cabinet reshuffle in which junior Home Office minister James Brokenshire becomes Minister of State, while Karen Bradley moves . from the whips office to fill his role. John Penrose is promoted . within the whips office to replace Ms Bradley and Harriet Baldwin is . brought into the Government ranks as a junior whip. In response to the shake-up, Theresa May said: 'James Brokenshire's well-deserved promotion is a testament to the ability and diligence he has shown in the Home Office since 2010. 'I also want to welcome Karen Bradley to the department. She has demonstrated great promise since her election and I look forward to working with her.' Labour’s shadow . Immigration Minister, David Hanson, described Mr Harper as ‘decent’ for . stepping down but added: ‘Perhaps once again the Government need to . think very carefully about how they approach this issue as it is clear . there are limits to the effectiveness of relying on employer and . landlord checks to address illegal immigration.’ Taxpayers . paid thousands of pounds for the services of Mr Harper’s cleaner. In . 2007-08, he claimed £946 on his parliamentary expenses for cleaning and . ironing, with the bill rising to £1,262 the following year. He submitted . dozens of printed receipts for weekly cleaning bills, which totalled . £30 a week for three hours’ worth of work. Last . night it was unclear whether the ex-Minister would have to pay a fine. Whitehall sources insist he would avoid one because his cleaner was . self-employed. But legal experts say this is not an automatic defence. Under Section 15 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, . employers are liable for civil penalties of up to £10,000 if they do not . ‘verify, retain, copy or record the content’ of a worker’s documents. In . 2009, Labour’s Attorney General Baroness Scotland was fined £5,000 for . employing a Tongan housekeeper who was in the UK illegally – because she . failed to keep copies of her papers. New . Assistant Whip Harriett Baldwin was educated at £31,000-a-year . Marlborough College, the Wiltshire school attended by Kate Middleton. She spent two decades at investment bank JP Morgan Chase, before winning . the safe Tory seat of Worcestershire West in 2010. Another . beneficiary of the reshuffle is comprehensive-educated Tory Karen . Bradley, who becomes a junior Minister at the Home Office. In . April 2007 I took on a cleaner for my London flat. In doing so, I was . very mindful of my legal and financial obligations and undertook a . number of checks beforehand. This included consideration of the HMRC . tests as to whether the cleaner was performing her work under a contract . for services on a self-employed basis which I concluded she was. However, . even though there was no legal requirement for me to check her right to . work in the UK, I felt that it was appropriate to do so. I . therefore took a copy of her passport to verify her identity and also a . copy of a Home Office letter, dated 26 January 2006, which stated that . she had leave to remain indefinitely in the United Kingdom, including . the right to work and engage in a business. I . considered the issue again when you appointed me as a Minister in the . Cabinet Office in May 2010 and concluded that as I had performed a right . to work check in 2007 and that my cleaner had indefinite leave to . remain in the UK no further check was necessary. When . you then appointed me as Immigration Minister in September 2012 I went . through a similar consideration process and once again concluded that no . further check was necessary.  In retrospect, I should have checked more . thoroughly. As I took . the Immigration Bill through Parliament in autumn 2013 I talked a lot . about these matters in the context both of employers and landlords. What . we do, and will, require of both is that they carry out reasonable . checks and take copies of documents. We . do not require them to be experts or spot anything other than an . obvious forgery. Given this focus on these matters, I thought it prudent . to check that all my documents were in order for my cleaner. I . undertook an extensive search to locate the copies of documents I had . taken but unfortunately I was unable to locate them. As . a result, in the week commencing 20 January 2014 I asked my cleaner for . further copies of these documents which she provided on 4 February. On . 5 February, I asked my private office to check the details with . immigration officials to confirm that all was in order. I was informed . on the morning of 6 February that my cleaner did not in fact have . indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. I immediately notified . the Home Secretary and my Permanent Secretary. This is now a matter . for Immigration Enforcement. Although . I complied with the law at all times, I consider that as Immigration . Minister, who is taking legislation through Parliament which will . toughen up our immigration laws, I should hold myself to a higher . standard than expected of others. I have also considered the impact on . my Parliamentary colleagues, the Government and you. I have always . believed that politics is a team game, not an individual sport. Under . the circumstances, I have therefore decided that the right course is for . me to return to the Backbenches. I am sorry for any embarrassment . caused. I am grateful . for the opportunities you have given me since you became Leader of the . Conservative Party, first in Opposition and then in Government. I will . continue to support you as Prime Minister, the Conservative Party and . this Government in whatever way I can from the backbenches. I will also . continue to serve my constituents in the Forest of Dean to the best of . my ability.","Tory Mr Harper has been Immigration Minister since 2012 .

"By . Nick Constable . and Nigel Bunyan . Anguish: Three more women have made allegations against Bill Roache. This week he was cleared of all charges against him and is set to return to work . The husband of a key witness in the Bill Roache trial says she is planning civil action against him over an alleged sex assault. The woman, who cannot be identified, is furious at what  she calls an ‘abysmal’ police investigation. The revelation came as it emerged that several new witnesses have come forward to claim they were sexually assaulted by the Coronation Street actor. The woman testified during the trial at which Roache was acquitted on all charges, but claims there is evidence which the jury did not hear and she accuses police officers of failing to pursue leads. Her husband said: ‘We intend to instruct lawyers and will look to bring a civil action against William Roache. ‘My wife feels she was led up the garden path by police. 'They promised various pieces of important evidence would be placed before the court but we never heard any of it. ‘Instead they relied entirely on my wife and other women taking the stand. For instance, there was evidence relating to a gold  Rolls-Royce which she rode in. ‘It was said that the defendant did not have such a car at the time in question. 'The police told us they couldn’t check because DVLA records didn’t go back to the 1960s – but surely inquiries could establish this. Rovers return: Speaking outside court following his acquittal the 81-year-old said: 'In these situations there are no winners. I would like to get back to work' ‘Why couldn’t they ask questions, wear . out a bit of shoe leather, instead of just relying on computer records? My wife has been honest all the way through. Now she’s been on . medication since before Christmas and is completely traumatised by what . has happened.’ Sources close . to the Roache investigation say that ‘several’ women have contacted . police but they are unlikely to pursue new claims. At least three women made their allegations during the actor’s 17-day trial. It is understood they concern incidents said to have taken place in the late 1960s and  the early 1970s. One of the women, now married and aged 64, alleges she met the actor when she was a teenage autograph-hunter. Lancashire Police sources confirmed last night that officers had spoken to each of the new complainants. However, a detective said: ‘There is no investigation, and there won’t be one.’ Roache’s legal team claimed throughout the trial that he had been targeted as part of a ‘witch-hunt’ against celebrities. It is an allegation both Lancashire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service deny. Nazir . Afzal, the chief prosecutor for the North West, said: ‘When the . evidence passes the prosecution test it is right that a jury considers . the evidence. When a jury delivers a verdict, no matter what it is, that . is justice being done.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Actor not guilty of indecently assaulting four girls and twice raping a fifth .

"By . Ray Massey . First Great Western has been forced to cut ‘walk-on’ fares to the stricken West country by a quarter  following a backlash over alleged ‘profiteering.’ The action comes less 24 hours travellers were being forced to pay double for their journeys to and from the stricken West Country after the train company withdrew its ‘advance purchase’ discount tickets in the wake of storm damage chaos. Whitehall sources said Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin had been ‘outraged’ when he read of the situation and had made ‘strong representations’ to the rail company to ensure passengers had a fair deal. Damage: Workmen carrying out limited repairs to the seafront and railway lines at Dawlish, Devon after a section of it was swept into the sea earlier this week . Inspection: Secretary of State for Transport Patrick McLoughlin inspects the damage to the track at Dawlish with Network Rail's Route Director, Patrick Hallgate, centre . The minister announced the new train fare deal as he visited Dawlish in Devon where part of the line has collapsed into the sea. It was being hailed today as a victory for disgruntled passengers facing a double-whammy of six weeks of disruption and higher travel costs. The ticket row erupted after regular peak-time travellers who book well ahead for a heavily discounted ‘Advance’ tickets on specified peak-time services found on they were unable to do so. First Great Western had denied ‘profiteering’ and insisted its action on services ‘West of Exeter’ was unavoidable following storms and the damage to the track. This was the scene as waves whipped up by stormy weather crashed over the train tracks on Dawlish's seaside line . Waves undermine the main London to Cornwall rail line, used by thousands of travellers . Repair: Railway workers continue to inspect the main Exeter to Plymouth railway line that has been closed due to parts of it being washed away by the sea . Network Rail say it will take ‘at least six weeks’ to re-open the Dawlish line. But yesterday in response to the backlash, First Great Western confirmed a ‘25 per cent discount on walk-up fares for services affected by Dawlish line closure. In a statement the train company said: ‘First Great Western has confirmed it will be offering discounted fares to customers travelling on its services affected by the closure of the railway at Dawlish.’ It added; ‘Advance Purchase fares will also be reintroduced on the route for combined bus and rail fares from Wednesday next week. The company has been unable to offer Advance Purchase tickets – which are tied to specific trains - since Wednesday, as we were unable to guarantee which trains would be running.’ FGW also said: ’A 25 per cent discount will apply to all walk-up fares - including Any time, Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets - for journeys that pass through the affected area, and will remain in place until the line reopens.’ With high tides combined with gale force winds and further heavy rain, some parts of the UK are bracing themselves for more flooding . Prices: Normally, a full-price ‘Anytime’ single ticket from Penzance costs £142 while a pre-booked ‘Advance’ ticket may be half that . First Great Western managing director, Mark Hopwood said: ‘We recognise that this work will mean customers are inconvenienced, and journey times are likely to take longer than normal as we look at alternative ways of getting customers to where they need to go. We want our prices to reflect that. ‘No-one should lose out because of this. FGW's promise is that anyone who has been unable to purchase an Advance Purchase ticket because they were removed from the system and paid more than they would have done normally, will be reimbursed the difference.’ Normally, a full-price ‘Anytime’ single ticket from Penzance costs £142 while a pre-booked ‘Advance’ ticket may be half that. The alarm was raised when a regular commuter who travels peak-time to London Paddington on a First Great Western service from Castle Cary in Somerset with the added benefit of a senior rail  discount noticed he was unable to buy his usual Advance Single ticket costing £27.85 and was forced instead to buy for Monday a full fare single ticket for £63.70. ‘Initially I wondered whether for some reason there was heavy demand and I had simply left it late to book, but I checked prices for the next Monday – February  17 -  and it is the same. No Advance Single tickets available - only the full fare at £63.70. So effectively the fare has doubled.’ The full Anytime single- without the senior rate discount costs £96.50.","Train company cuts 'walk-on' fares by 25% after alleged 'profiteering'

"By . Sam Webb . A British husband and wife team have spent an arduous 568 days cycling in an attempt to break the record for distance travelled - on a tandem bicycle. Kat and Steve Turner set off from Christchurch in New Zealand in April 2012, just eight months after they wed, and have traversed a vast portion of the globe on trusty tandem 'Hooch' - mostly sleeping in a tiny two-man tent. The intrepid couple gave up well-paid jobs as a teacher and caseworker for the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman before leaving their chickens and cat at their home in Forest Hill, south east London, with friends who are house-sitting for them. A bicycle made for two: Kat and Steve Turner are trying to break the world record for the longest tandem ride . Breather: Steve takes a break as the couple near the end of their trek through China . Incredibly, Kat, 32, had never even ridden a bike more than a few yards before they decided to take on the challenge, which is being made to raise money and awareness for development charity Practical Action. So far they have travelled through New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey and are currently in Greece. The couple hope to return to the UK in early 2014, having beaten the previous world record of 38,143kms set by Phil and Louise Shambrook 15 years ago. In more remote parts of central Asia and the Far East, many people had met few foreigners, if any . The couple admit to tensions, but say their relationship is now stronger than ever. Due to inflation, Steve was given a carrier bag full of money (right) in Uzbekistan in exchange for gingerly handing over $50 . So what did their family and friends think when they first announced the epic trip? Steve, 34, said: 'Initially they were surprised and of course they raised a few worries about our safety but from the outset we had overwhelming support from our family and friends who were excited on our behalf of all the places we would see and adventures we would have. Now they, like us, are astounded that we have cycled all this way.' The couple say they are constantly 'inspired and amazed' about the glimpses they get into the daily life of all the different communities they cycle through, such as the hill tribes of Northern Laos and Northern Vietnam, the minority groups in Yunnan province of China, aborigines in Central Australia, the nomadic people of Kyrgyzstan and the shepherds on horse back in Kazakhstan. Some of the landscapes the pair cycled through were almost otherworldly . Home sweet home: Some of their sleeping quarters were unconventional to say the least . Tandem: Steve and 'Hooch' in Malaysia - but there's no time for a shave . 'What really inspires us is that while there are vast differences in culture, language, fashion, wealth and religion, to all these communities family, friends, love and laughter are the most important thing,' Kat added. However, the trip has not been without its moments of tension, even danger. They say they had the most difficulties with authorities in China. If they were staying at a hotel, there were many times when the police would bang loudly and incessantly on the bedroom door. Steve added: 'Two to five officers would barge into our room, demanding our passports and reasons for our presence in their town. 'They were always courteous but we could never relax when staying in a hotel as we waited for the dreaded knock at the door and we found their interrogations about our comings and goings intimidating.' Epic ride: The couple's journey from New Zealand to London via three continents will last well into 2014 . Kat added: 'There was an occasion when the police refused to let us onto the only road to Urumqi which skirted between the Gobi Desert to the north and the Taklamakan Desert to the south. The police insisted we use the old road which we knew from our research no longer existed and which they also admitted they knew no longer existed. 'Despite this there was a stand-off between us and them for about an hour as we explained they were putting our lives at serious risk by sending us into the middle of the desert on a road they knew was not there.' 'They insisted that bicycles were not allowed on the only road to Urumqi despite us seeing at least two Chinese cycle tourers cycle past on that very road. 'In the end we took the old road, which soon turned to dust. It was impossible to even see, let alone cycle. We managed to find a gap on the only road and snuck onto it.' Still smiling: Kat had barely any experience cycling before they took on the challenge . Odyssey: Over two years, the couple plan to cycle from New Zealand back to their home in Forest Hill, London . Hardened: The pair traded comfortable lives in London for intense physical activity and spartan conditions . At the beginning of the trip in New . Zealand, the couple were forced to cycle through the night as their . progress to the nearest campsite had been hampered by a rough gravel road, endless hills, strong headwinds and icy rain. 568 days on the road . Distance cycled - 26,200km . World Record - 38,143km . 11,943km left to go . Elevation Gain - 249,365m(Everest climbed 28 times) Time moving in the saddle: 1585 hours (Kat could have typed the complete works of Shakespeare three times) Kat . added: 'We had to cycle through a gorge with a sheer cliff rock face to . our left and a huge drop to a raging river to our right. Due to the . terrible weather, there was water . pouring out of the weaknesses in the rock face and evidence of rock . falls and boulders the size of footballs. It was a very scary situation to be in.' They were also in the eastern Chinese town of Dingxi when an earthquake hit, killing 95 people. There were health trials too. Steve suffered with a terrible episode of heat exhaustion in Cambodia, Kat had a fractured knee-cap after they hit a railway track and she was also bitten by a dog on a campsite in the Outback. Steve said: 'We've both had regular bouts of poorly tummies, sore bums after long days, bad backs after terrible roads, but all in all we've probably been healthier than when we are at home. The trip has been full of incredible experiences, but the Turners say Kyrgyzstan was the highlight so far. 'It was a great experience because we didn't know what to expect as we'd never heard of it before and couldn't even spell it,' said Steve. 'The mountains were stunning, the nomadic people on horseback were friendly, it was interesting to see yurts being packed up for the winter and we spent peaceful nights camping under the stars.' The pair have have also eaten an incredible variety of different cuisines as they traversed Asia. They say the best meal was shashlik (barbequed kebabs) and bread in Central Asia - a treat after so many months of eating rice and noodles. Desolate beauty: Much of the ride took them through unspoilt countryside . The worst meal was probably pig intestine served as a special dish at the home of a 'wonderful' Chinese couple who had never met a foreigner in their 70 years. Kat said: 'It wasn't a terrible taste but a difficult texture. However, being hungry cyclists, any food usually looks and tastes pretty good to us.' How have most people they have met reacted to their odyssey? Steve said: 'The sight of us two on our huge tandem and trailer makes people laugh. People are excited to talk to us about our trip. 'We've been completely taken aback by the many acts of kindness we have received, from being handed a chocolate bar or cold drink out of the window of a passing vehicle, to being warmly welcomed into the homes of strangers and fed wonderful meals.' They admit to missing roast dinners, clean toilets and being part of a community in England, but also feel there are some things to be learned from other cultures, such as less emphasis on material possessions and less fear of strangers, the unknown and taking chances. They are completing the trip to raise money for British international development charity Practical Action, which uses technology to help solve the problems of people living in poverty in the developing world. Steve added: 'Practical Action is a . charity that sets out to use technology to challenge poverty and more . often than not, it is the simplest ideas that have the biggest impact.' The food Steve most enjoyed was shashliks (a type of kebab) found in central Asia . Creature comforts: The Turners admit they miss toilets in the UK . He added: 'A great example of simple technology is the bicycle. It is such a simple form of transport â€“ yet it is life changing to millions around the world and in our case is capable of taking us around it. Our trip has taken us through thousands of villages, towns and communities of all walks of life.  But no matter what the local religion, culture or climate is - the basic physical, emotional and spiritual needs are universal. 'Basic human needs are actually quite simple, yet there is a huge gap between the rich and the poor of the world, with many people on the planet struggling to meet even their basic physical needs. 'The resource and ideas to raise all people above the poverty line are in our hands and Practical Action is a charity that seeks to do this is a practical and sustainable way.'

"By . Jill Reilly . A British school teacher found dead in Qatar had been sexually assaulted and stabbed before her burnt remains were left smouldering in a remote desert location, a court heard. The prosecutor in a court in Doha called for one of two men on trial to be given the death penalty for allegedly murdering 24-year-old Lauren Patterson - calling it 'heinous and shocking' to the country's 'conservative society'. Miss Patterson's mother Alison Patterson from West Malling, Kent, and other family members, were in court to hear how a post mortem on her remains led to the discovery of a knife lodged inside her rib cage. 'Excited to be back': Lauren Patterson, right, was clubbing with best friend Lea Monet, left, before she was killed. Two Qatari men are on trial and the prosecutor has called for one of them to be given the death penalty . Two Qatari men, who have not been named, were arrested after being identified by Miss Patterson's friend as being the last people to see her alive, the court heard. At an earlier hearing last month the friend testified how she and Miss Patterson and the two men, who they were 'casually acquainted with', left a nightclub at La Cigale Hotel in Doha around 3.30am on October 12 last year. She said Miss Patterson, who had just returned from attending her grandmother's funeral in England, was not drunk and was 'aware of her surroundings'. She said the men dropped her home with the promise they would also drop off her friend shortly afterwards at her house. The friend told the court when she tried to call Miss Patterson the following morning her phone was off. She said when she asked the first defendant about this, he said he could have dropped off Miss Patterson at the wrong building. At court: Miss Patterson's mother Alison and uncle Brian Roke, were in court in Doha . The friend said the next day she noticed he had a cut on his lower lip and it was swollen, which were not there when she last saw him. At Thursday's hearing the prosecutor said one of the defendants took Miss Patterson to a home he used for sexual trysts with women, 'conquered her body', and killed her by stabbing her twice. He said with the help of the second defendant, he put Miss Patterson's body in the boot of his car and drove her out of the city of Doha to Al-Kharrara, where they burned her remains. The court was told a knife was found inside the 24-year-old's rib cage. At a previous hearing on January 27 a forensic doctor testified he went to the crime scene on a farm in Al-Kharrara, near Wakrah. He said he found a pit containing the remains of a smouldering human body. He said a knife was stuck in 'what appeared to be' the rib cage of the body. Due to the extensive damage to the body from the fire, the doctor said he could not ascertain whether the cause of death was by stabbing, whether there was alcohol in the body, or if any sexual contact had taken place. The court heard a detailed forensic investigation also uncovered a strand of Miss Patterson's hair in the first defendant's car, and matching sand granules were found on the remains, the tyres of his car and shoes at his home. The prosecutor called for the first defendant to get the death penalty for intentionally killing Patterson. He said because the defendant is Muslim, the Islamic Shari'a principal of qasas (retribution) should be exacted in the form of the death penalty. Link: Miss Patterson was identified by DNA which was matched to her mother Alison (right), a reflexologist . He said Miss Patterson, who worked at a primary school in Doha, had been sexually assaulted but forensic tests could not prove this because the remains were too badly burned. The prosecutor said that even if the sex was consensual, the defendant and Miss Patterson were not married, so the act was still a crime in Islam. He also asked the court to punish the first defendant for having sex outside of marriage and for alcohol consumption. Both defendants are also charged with burning Miss Patterson's body and 'damaging and erasing' evidence. The prosecutor did not specify how many years in prison he was seeking for the second defendant, only saying the maximum sentence should be given. The defence argued there was 'not one piece of solid evidence' against the defendants. He said the cause of death could not be determined by the forensic examiner and alleged the defendants' confessions were made under duress. He said the first defendant was in prison for 10 days before his family found out he had been arrested. School: The 24-year-old was working as a teacher at The Newton International School in Doha for several months before she was killed . His lawyer was also not present for his confession, the defence claimed. He said Miss Patterson willingly went to the first defendant's home where she got into an argument with him about her ex-boyfriend, who was a mutual friend. Phone records support the first defendant called Miss Patterson's ex-boyfriend at this time, the court heard. He said Miss Patterson grew 'hysterical' and attacked the first defendant with a knife, cutting his lip in a fit of rage. He claimed she fell on the floor where the knife hit her. He also said there was no evidence to support the alcohol consumption and illicit sex charges, and asked that both defendants be acquitted based on 'lack of evidence'. A lawyer representing Lauren's family addressed the court, asking for the the 'strongest punishments' to be given to the defendants. Favourite: Lauren enjoyed an evening at Club 7, pictured, before she was killed . He also petitioned the court for monetary compensation, saying that Miss Patterson's mother had requested 20 million Qatar Riyal (aprox Â£3.6 million pounds) be paid by the defendants - 15 million Qatar Riyal for the pain Miss Patterson must have endured before her death, and five million Qatar Riyal for the emotional damage felt by her mother. After the hearing MIss Patterson's mother and other family supporters declined to comment on the case. Qatari journalists say MIss Patterson's murder has drawn significant international attention, and the trial has proceeded quickly through the country's often slow court system. This was the third hearing of the case in a court in Doha with a verdict scheduled to be delivered on March 27. At the earlier court hearing on January 27 a police officer testified he had seen a pick-up truck with two men driving near the crime scene the night Miss Patterson's body was dumped. He said the driver was nervous, but he could not positively identify them as the defendants in the courtroom. The officer told the court the truck was not registered to the first defendant, but records showed he had driven it to Saudi Arabia numerous times. The truck's tyre tracks also matched earlier treads left near the farm.","Lauren Patterson's burned body was dumped in a pit in the desert in Qatar .

"By . Martha De Lacey . An underpants company has designed a range of briefs, boxers and shorties which use chemical warfare technology to filter flatulence. And there's no need to feel embarrassed about buying them - even Chelsea player Frank Lampard has a pair. Unisex: Shreddies flatulence-absorbing underwear comes in a range of styles for men and women . Shreddies - no relation to the breakfast cereal - feature a special, highly porous carbon cloth back panel which works by absorbing, trapping and neutralising flatulence odours. The thin, flexible cloth - the same activated carbon material used in chemical warfare suits - is then reactivated simply by washing the pants and does not need replacing. The award-winning underwear is suitable for both men in women and comes in a range of styles, all of which are meant to fit the body more snugly than conventional underwear. Women can buy Shreddies in briefs, high-leg briefs or shorties, while men can purchase support boxers, adjustable support boxers, hipsters and briefs. The hi-tech underpants - which are now being advertised in women's magazines as 'a girl's best friend' - are particularly useful for sufferers of digestive disorders such as IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), Crohn's disease, Dyspepsia, Colitis and food intolerances, or those suffering the after effects of bowel surgery. Now and then: Shreddies - pairs of which are . owned by Christine Bleakley and Frank Lampard, left - function using the . same technology employed in chemical warfare suits . There are many flatulence relief . remedies on the market - including pills and charcoal tablets - but no . effective anti-flatulence treatment for sufferers of such complaints, . and Shreddies offer a proven method of removing the odour of excessive . bad gas. Customers who have . used Shreddies - which won the Look Good Feel Good Award at the . Association For Incontinence Advice awards in 2009 - have commented on . their website, with one man saying his wife calls them his 'socialising . underwear'. Another, . Jennifer A from Newcastle, says: 'They're an answer to a prayer, . absolutely fantastic, so effective and discreet. I only wish they'd been . invented 40 years ago! 'I . know the problems they address are usually the subject of a joke, but . it's no joke if you actually suffer from them, just the reverse. 'It's . marvellous to have the security they provide, both at work and . socially, in fact in every situation. I'm so glad someone came up with . this idea and will definitely be ordering some more.' A perfect pair: Adrian Chiles holding some pants (not Shreddies) alongside Christine Bleakley on Daybreak . How they work: Shreddies underpants function by filtering flatulence through a thin, highly porous carbon cloth . Shreddies previously featured on breakfast TV show Daybreak, during a segment in which presenters Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley pretended to squabble over a men's pair. In the end, Chiles took the underpants home, but Shreddies spokesman Ianthe Betts-Clarke said: 'Christine was really trying her best to get her hands on the pants but with very little success because Adrian Chiles really wasn't letting go. 'Since their pant-related tiff Christine has requested that we send her over her very own pair of flatulence filtering underwear and one for her other half - of course we were more than obliged to do so.' Shreddies also design underwear for people suffering from incontinence and those with stomas and colostomy bags.","Christine Bleakley obtained 'Shreddies' for both herself and her fiance .

Martin first met Hoffman when the actor reached out to him in 2003 seeking advice about the Labyrinth Theater Company's production of the Off-Broadway play 'The Last Days of Judas Iscariot directed by Hoffman.

Martin recalled to People Magazine how one time a parishioner entering the church recognized Hoffman from the crime drama ‘Before the Devil Knows You're Dead’ where he played a drug-addicted swindler opposite Ethan Hawke. ‘She said, “I saw you in that movie last night and you were very, very bad!” And he said, “Look, even before I step into church I'm getting guilt!”’ Martin recalled. Close ties: Rev. Martin, the Jesuit priest who presided over Hoffman's funeral service, first met Hoffman when the actor reached out to him in 2003 seeking advice about a role he had in the LAByrinth Theater Company's production of The Last Days of Judas Iscariot . In a tragic twist, it was the same church where Father Martin led the 46-year-old actor's funeral Mass Friday. ‘He was a lovely person, very down-to-earth,’ Martin told the magazine. ‘I learned about humility from him. He never put on airs. The clergyman said that Hoffman would never boast about the films he was in or the major roles he landed, instead simply saying, ‘Yeah, I got this job.’ ‘He would never say, “I'm the lead.” Or “I'm starring in ‘Capote,’’ Father Martin told People. ' Then I'd read about it in the papers and learn what it was.’ Marin, a worldly man with a keen sense of humor familiar to the viewers of The Colbert Report, where he is a frequent guest, described his late friend as someone who was fun to be around, but who was also very detail-oriented when it came to his work. ‘When you watched him act, you got a sense of what the word “vocation” really means,’ he said. He was born to do this.’ On Martin's public Facebook page, he described how during the filming of ‘Doubt’ he came on the set at Mount St. Vincent's College in Riverdale, New York, to watch Hoffman at work. Deeming Hoffman’s performance in a scene where he delivers a homily as too reserved, Martin suggested that he be more forceful, so that even those sitting in the back row would feel the power of his words. ‘But when I saw the final cut of ""Doubt"" it dawned on me that he knew that the camera was close up, and a louder homily wouldn't have worked,’ Martin wrote in his tribute. ‘My sister said, ""That's why he is the Oscar winner, and you're the Jesuit."" Method actor: Martin, far left, recalled how he took Hoffman (center) to St Ignatius Church to show him how a Mass is celebrated in preparation for his role in the 2008 film 'Doubt' Father Martin also shared a photo of the original cast of ‘The Last Days of Judas Iscariot’ at the Public Theater a decade ago, where Hoffman is depicted wearing a sweatshirt that was given to all the participants of the production. The front of the shirt features the definition of heaven offered by one of the play’s characters, who summed it up is as a place where you can ‘Eat Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes and Feel the Sun on Your Face.’ On Thursday, Hoffman, who fiercely . protected his private life, was mourned behind closed doors in an . emotional farewell from his close-knit family and loyal Hollywood . friends.

"By . Hugo Gye . and Arthur Martin . The BBC edited out images that showed Dave Lee Travis molesting a 17-year-old girl during the filming of Top Of The Pops, it was claimed in court yesterday. Footage of the presenter groping the teenager on a June 1978 episode of the music programme was ‘shrunk’ as if  to get rid of the offending scenes, a  jury was told. As Travis introduced a novelty song by The Smurfs, with a female audience member on either side of him, he slipped his hand up one girl’s skirt and ‘had a fumble’ of her bottom, it was alleged. The presenter then tried to force his hand into the teenager’s underwear, making her feel ‘violated’, the jury heard. The BBC edited out images that showed Dave Lee Travis molesting a 17-year-old girl during the filming of Top Of The Pops, it was claimed in court yesterday . But . when Top Of The Pops was broadcast later that week, the clip had been . cut just as the sexual assault began, it was claimed. Giving evidence . from behind a curtain  yesterday, the alleged victim said that if . viewers had seen all the footage it would have been ‘quite obvious’ that . she was being sexually assaulted. She told Southwark Crown Court that the images broke off as she began to ‘grimace’. The . woman’s friend, also appearing as a prosecution witness against the . former Radio 1 DJ, told the jury that the BBC appeared to have edited . the video deliberately to remove the attack. She . said: ‘It was shrunk. Seriously shrunk. When I watched it back with . other friends it felt like just the head part of us, rather than the . body shot that I think would have been there originally.’ In . cross examination, defence barrister Stephen Vullo asked: ‘You are . saying the BBC edited this video to get rid of the touching, is that . what you thought?’ She replied: ‘That’s what  we thought.’ The . alleged victim said she and her friend were excited when they got . tickets to attend the recording of Top Of The Pops at the BBC  studios . in Shepherd’s Bush, West London. During the show, they were asked by a . floor manager if they would like to be on TV next to Travis as he . introduced the next song – to which they agreed. Moments later the alleged victim appeared on stage wearing an off-the-shoulder top and a ra-ra skirt, with a flower in her hair. Accusations: Dave Lee Travis arriving at Southwark Crown Court today, where a woman claimed he assaulted her during the recording of Top of the Pops . ‘He put his arm around myself and pulled me towards him,’ the woman, now 48, told the court. ‘I suppose it looked quite good  on screen. ‘Then . he slipped his hand down and put it up my skirt. The skirt would have . been lifted from the back. I can only really describe it as having a . fumble of my bottom area. I think he was obviously trying to get into my . underwear.’ The woman . added: ‘He was introducing the next act as if nothing was happening. That’s why I just couldn’t comprehend what was going on. ‘I felt really uncomfortable. I think I just stood there. I felt a sort of shock. I felt violated. ‘The camera crew and everybody else was there and I was in front of all these people – that’s what made it more uncomfortable.’ In . court Travis, 68, wore a dark jacket and a pink tie printed with the . word ‘blam’. He groaned and sighed on several occasions as the woman . gave evidence – as he had done with previous witnesses. The footage of the two girls standing on either side of the DJ was shown to the jury yesterday. In the short clip, filmed in the break between two acts, Travis introduces a performance of novelty hit The Smurf Song. The court heard that when the girls got off the stage, the alleged victim told her friend she had been assaulted by Travis. The . pair decided not to report the attack to the BBC or the police because . they thought no one would believe them, the court heard. Mr Vullo told the witness she appeared to be smiling in a freeze-frame of the footage. ‘You smile because you were perfectly happy to be where you were and nothing bad was happening to you,’ he said. The woman replied: ‘A lot of photos are taken and they don’t always tell the truth. You can see from the video I’m not happy.’ Recording: Travis is alleged to have molested the teenager while being filmed at a BBC studio . Charges: Travis denies any wrongdoing and insists he has never assaulted anyone . Mr . Vullo then asked her: ‘What you are suggesting is that there has been a . conspiracy at the BBC in one of its biggest shows to exclude a sexual . assault?’ She replied: ‘I’m not saying that.’ The woman’s friend also told the court that Travis had approached them earlier in the show, when they were in the audience. ‘He . seemed to come up to approach us and I thought he was going to give us a . cuddle or a kiss,’ she said. ‘He is not really my type. I said “help” to someone who was near me and he backed off. He was known as the hairy . monster. ‘I just felt . intimidated. At that time I had no idea whether he would have assaulted . me, but the thought of him giving me a kiss and a cuddle wasn’t very . nice.’ Earlier, a former . hotel receptionist had told the court that Travis gave her a ‘bear hug’ and groped her bottom after she carried his suitcase to his room. The . DJ, whose real name is David Griffin, stayed in the Trust House Forte . hotel in Bude, Cornwall, in the early 80s while working on the Radio 1 . roadshow programme. Later . the same day he allegedly returned to reception and asked the woman, who . was 18 or 19 at the time: ‘Will I be having the pleasure of your . company later?’ She told the court she did not reply. Travis, . of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, denies 13 counts of indecent assault . between 1976 and 2003, and one count of sexual assault in 2008. The trial continues. Evidence: Travis pictured arriving at court yesterday, when he was accused of assaulting a 15-year-old . A teenage hotel worker at a coastal beauty spot told the court she was 'horrified' when Travis allegedly indecently assaulted her as she checked him into his room. The woman said she felt 'awful' as Travis began fiddling with her blouse as they took a lift to his room. Once inside, the veteran DJ - in the North Cornwall town of Bude as part of a Radio 1 concert - allegedly began to 'envelop' her with his arms, rubbing her lower back and bottom. She said the alleged incident lasted '15, 20, 30 seconds, but it seemed to go on forever'. Asked by prosecutor Miranda Moore QC why she did not complain to senior managers or police, the woman said: 'I was afraid that Mr Travis was a big star and I would be laughed out of town. 'I was a naive country girl.' The witness, giving evidence behind a grey curtain to avoid seeing the defendant at Southwark Crown Court, said she was assaulted by the disc jockey at the hotel where she worked in the 1980s, aged 18 or 19. The woman told the court Travis first started to meddle with her clothing as they shared a lift to his room, where she was to leave his bags. She said: 'I had a bow on my blouse and he started to twiddle with the bow. 'I felt uncomfortable. I thought, ""Something's wrong with my bow - this is awful."" I felt that I was in trouble because my uniform wasn't up to standard.' After being 'relieved' to reach the room, the woman said Travis instructed her to take his bag all the way into the room, by his bed. She said: 'He then had his arms around me, and enveloped me and gave me a massive bear hug. I was horrified, I was held very firmly. 'He carried on hugging me. He started rubbing his hands up and down my top and lower back, and then on my bum. I was in utter shock. I just didn't know how to deal with it.' The witness said Travis released his hands, prompting her to run to the ground floor, but she spent the rest of her shift in fear that Travis would confront her later. Heyday: Travis pictured in the 1970s when he was at the height of his fame as a DJ and presenter . She told the court: 'He approached the desk. He said, ""Will I be having the pleasure of your company later on?"" 'I didn't answer the question. I just thought something was terribly wrong.' Yesterday . the court hear that a 15-year-old farmer’s daughter thought Dave Lee . Travis was going to rape her when he attacked her at a Showaddywaddy . concert. The DJ said ‘I love . big boobs’ before pulling up her bra, ‘flicking’ her nipples and . kissing her breasts in his motorhome at the gig in 1978, it was said. Giving . evidence from behind a curtain, the woman – who is now 51 – said: ‘He . put his hand up my skirt, to my thigh. I was crying, I was shouting at . him to stop. I thought he was going to rape me. ‘I . was a naive 15-year-old. It was my first sexual experience. I lived on a . farm and I didn’t have many social skills. I was star-struck, I was in . awe of him.’ The trial continues.

"By . Jill Reilly . Bruce Springsteen is the latest famous face to call for justice for Trayvon Martin. At his show  in Limerick, Ireland, the 63-year-old dedicated his protest song American Skin (41 Shots), to the 17-year-old who was shot dead in February 2012 by neighbourhood vigilante George Zimmerman. According to the New Jersey Star-Ledger, after seeing the song written on a fan's sign Springsteen decided to play the track, dedicating it to Martin. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Springsteen dedicated his protest song American Skin (41 Shots) to the late teen Trayvon Martin at a concert in Limerick, Ireland . Cause: Springsteen's song  American Skin (41 Shots) was written by Springsteen after the 1999 shooting death of Amadou Diallo,  23, left. The musician played it this week to highlight the case of Trayvon Martin, 17 . He reportedly told the crowd at his Wrecking Ball Tour, 'I want to send this one out as a letter back home. For justice for Trayvon Martin.' Originally released in 2001, American Skin (41 Shots) was written by Springsteen after the 1999 shooting death of Amadou Diallo. Amadou Diallo, 23, an unarmed West African immigrant died when he was hit by 19 of the 41 shots fired by police in the Bronx. Echoes of the past: A woman carries a sign at a rally outside State Supreme Court in the Bronx Section of New York in 1999 . Protests: Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant died when he was hit by 19 of the 41 shots fired by police in the Bronx. Bruce Springsteen played the song at his opening night concert at New York's Madison Square Garden in 2000, right . Amadou Diallo, 23, an unarmed West African immigrant died when he was hit by 19 of the 41 shots fired by police in the Bronx. The officers, who were working undercover, claimed they shot Mr Diallo because he appeared to have a gun in his hand. The 'gun' turned out to be a wallet. He died in the doorway of his Bronx apartment building. The four officers in the case were acquitted of criminal charges - they told the court they had believed they were in danger. Mr Diallo, from Guinea, had moved to the United States two years before being killed. His death unleashed cries of police brutality and racial profiling. The trial focused attention on the issue of excessive use of force by police against minorities. They claimed they opened fire after seeing Diallo reach for what looked like a gun -  the object turned out to be a wallet.The four officers in that case were acquitted of criminal charges. Springsteen accused the officers of racism in the song with one lyric stating: 'Is it a gun, is it a knife/Is it a wallet, this is your life/It ain't no secret/It ain't no secret/No secret my friend/You can get killed just for living/In your American skin.' Springsteen debuted the song in 2000, in Atlanta, Ga., and he went on to play it during his 10-show residency at New York's Madison Square Garden. It appears on his 2001, Live in New York City album. Springsteen is the latest famous face to make a comment on the Zimmerman ruling. Yesterday music legend Stevie Wonder announced that he won't perform again in Florida again until the state's . notorious 'Stand Your Ground' law is repealed. His decision follows the outrage by other celebrities and performers at the acquittal of neighborhood vigilante George Zimmerman . The singing legend made his statement at a show in Quebec City, Canada, over the weekend. Principles: Stevie Wonder has announced that he will no longer perform in any state which has a 'Stand Your Ground' law - specifically Florida - in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal . He said: 'I decided . today that until the 'Stand Your Ground' law is abolished in Florida, I . will never perform there again. As a matter of fact, wherever I find . that law exists I will not perform in that state or in that part of the . world.' He continued: . 'The truth is that for those of you who've lost in the battle for . justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world, we can't bring . them back. 'What . we can do is we can let our voices be heard. And we can vote in our . various countries throughout the world for change and equality for . everybody. That's what I know we can do.' Under the 'Stand Your Ground Law' a person is able to use deadly force if they fear their life is under threat. Florida officials have repeatedly said they will not consider scrapping the controversial law. Zimmerman, 29, was cleared of the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin after a trial that divided America. George Zimmerman is greeted by defense counsel Don West at the start of his trial in Seminole circuit court in Sanford, Florida last week before his acquittal on Saturday night . He has gone into hiding amid death threats. Outrage over the Zimmerman verdict has led to an outpouring of anger on the streets of many US cities. Black . performers have used Twitter to express their anger that Zimmerman was . not held accountable for the death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, . Florida. Stars such as . Jay-Z, Beyonce, A Tribe Called Quest and Q-Tip are among those who've . dedicated live performances to the late teenager. Since . George Zimmerman's controversial acquittal, civil rights groups and . leaders have called for legal action against the neighborhood watch . volunteer. On Sunday, in a . move which could have dramatic ramifications, the Justice Department . confirmed today that it will look into the shooting death of Trayvon . Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal . charges against George Zimmerman in the wake of his acquittal. The department opened an . investigation into Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow . the state prosecution to proceed. In . a statement Sunday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of . the civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office for . the Middle District of Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence . generated during the federal probe, in addition to the evidence and . testimony from the state trial. Outraged: NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous (center) has launched a petition to have federal civil rights charges brought against George Zimmerman by Attorney General Eric Holder . The Rev. Al Sharpton makes a statement outside the US Justice Department in Washington, DC, July 16, 2013, calling for a federal investigation into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.  Sharpton . The . statement said that, in the government's words, 'experienced federal . prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable . violation.' This moves follows demands from a furious NAACP for the Obama administration to intervene. Already, . over 100,000 people have signed up to an online petition and the NAACP . has written a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder urging the . Department of Justice to press civil rights charges against 29-year-old . Zimmerman. In his first . public statement since the verdict, President Barack Obama called for . calm on Sunday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the fatal . shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, saying his death was a . tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem gun violence. 'We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,' Obama, the first black U.S. president, said in a statement. 'I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.' Obama, . who last year said that 'if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,' added . that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings. 'And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,' he said. The . president urged Americans to broaden 'the circle of understanding and . compassion' in their communities and put some of the emotion the case . has aroused into curtailing gun violence. 'We . should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun . violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily . basis,' he said.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . An ancient mosaic showing a menagerie of animals from birds to leopards, has been unearthed in southern Israel. The intricate artwork was found when a 1,500-year-old Byzantine church was excavated and has Greek symbols, which archaeologists say shows that it once served as a centre of Christian worship. The church ruins were discovered during excavations ahead of an infrastructure project in Aluma, some 30 miles (50km) south of Tel Aviv, Israel. An ancient mosaic showing a menagerie of animals from birds (pictured) to leopards, has been unearthed in southern Israel in a town near Tel Aviv . Archaeologists believe the church was an important part of a Byzantine settlement, which lay on the main road running between Jerusalem and the ancient sea port of Ashkelon. ‘The church probably served as a centre of Christian worship for neighbouring communities,’ they said. Experts from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) discovered marble pillars and the mosaic floor inside the basilica, which measures 72ft by 39ft (22 by 12metres). Daniel Varga, director of the IAA's excavations, said: The ‘fine mosaic floor decorated with coloured geometric designs’ lies in the entrance of the church and there is a ‘twelve-row dedicatory inscription in Greek containing the names Mary and Jesus, and the name of the person who funded the mosaic's construction.’ The intricate artwork was found when a 1,500-year-old Byzantine church was excavated and has Greek symbols, which archaeologists said show that it once served as a centre of Christian worship . The mosaics in what would have been the church’s nave are decorated with vines in the shape of 40 medallions, which each show a different animal, including a zebra, leopard, wild boar, turtle and winged birds as well as botanical and geometric designs. There are also Greek inscriptions that mention two local leaders of the church, Demetrios and Herakles. The mosaics in what would have been the church's nave are decorated with vines in the shape of 40 medallions, which each show a different animal, including a zebra, leopard (foreground), wild boar (back left), turtle and winged birds as well as botanical and geometric designs . On both sides of the central nave there are two narrow halls or side aisles, which also have coloured mosaic floors depicting botanical and geometric designs, as well as Christian symbols. A pottery workshop, mainly for the production of jars, was also uncovered during the excavations and yielded numerous finds, including, amphorae, cooking pots, bowls and different types of oil lamps. Glass vessels typical of the Byzantine period were also discovered at the site, and indicate a rich and flourishing local culture, archaeologists said. On both sides of the central nave there are two narrow halls or side aisles, which also have coloured mosaic floors depicting botanical and geometric designs, as well as Christian symbols. This mosaic shows vine medallions framing birds and Greek words . t has been decided that the site (pictured) will be covered over to preserve it for future generations and the mosaic will be removed, conserved and displayed locally . Excavations by the IAA along the same road have revealed other communities from the same period, but no churches have been found until now. It is thought people living in the area some 1,500 years ago made a living by making wine and exporting it west to the coast so it could be sold in the wider Mediterranean area.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A drugs squad officer became hooked on heroin after posing as an addict for undercover operations. Robert Carroll, 40,  who lives in Huddersfield, claimed he 'inhaled fumes' from the class A drug while pretending to be a junkie to trap dealers. Manchester Crown Court heard how the lines between his real life and that of his undercover alter ego, 'Lee Taylor', became dangerously blurred as he began to smoke heroin every day. Jailed: Greater Manchester Police drugs squad officer Robert Carroll has been jailed after becoming hooked on heroin . Pc Carroll has now been jailed for 14 months by a judge who heard that he gave his drug dealer police issue weapons, and sneaked away from work to meet him in a police car. Carroll admitted charges of misconduct in public office and theft. The former officer, who was sacked by the Chief Constable earlier this year, claims Greater Manchester Police failed him by not protecting him from the risk of addiction or supporting him through his problems. GMP denies the claims. Carroll joined GMP in 2001 and trained as a 'test purchase' officer in 2006. By 2009 Carroll was using a wrap a day of heroin and was in touch with the drugs charity Lifeline . In 2008, he joined the force's Sigma unit - which is dedicated to rooting out drug dealers using covert tactics. Police have gone undercover as addicts in a number of crackdowns in recent years, most recently in Operation Cairo, which targeted street dealers in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. Whilst working for the unit, he was commended for his work by his commanders and a judge. But by 2009, Carroll was using a wrap a day of heroin and was in touch with the drugs charity Lifeline. He was prescribed Subutex and attempted to wean himself off the drug, but by 2012 he had lapsed. In July of that year, a drug dealer's home was raided by police who found a GMP issue CS gas canister and a baton which had been issued to Carroll. At the time, Carroll was working at Oldham police station on 'restricted duties' after time off with depression. But twice in one morning he sneaked off his shift at the station to meet the dealer, raising bosses' suspicions. A raid at Carroll's home days later recovered a phone which revealed he had contacted the dealer 2,200 times in the previous four months. Carroll says he has now beaten his addiction . Carroll says he has now beaten his addiction - with the help of his police officer wife, who took charge of his money and booked hypnotherapy sessions. When he was sacked by Sir Peter Fahy earlier this year, the Chief Constable described it as an 'enormous tragedy' for a 'very hardworking officer' and his family, the court heard. In a statement Carroll said he 'simply needed help' - and got 'no support from the force'. Before he was jailed, the former officer told the M.E.N. he was distraught at what he had put his family through, and accused GMP of 'forgoing the handling of their most valuable equipment - people'. Jailing him, Judge Martin Steiger QC said: 'I fully recognise that the defendant became addicted through his police service and he's to be commended on the efforts he made in the interests of law and order. 'But where police officers suffer because of their duties it is incumbent upon them to obtain treatment and help. 'He did not do so - he did the very opposite - he continued his association with White. 'A significant sentence is called for to demonstrate the high standards the public expect from police.' After the case GMP dismissed some of Carroll's claims. Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley said: 'Whatever personal mitigation Carroll may have, it is not an excuse for such a wanton abuse of his position as a police officer. 'When someone becomes a police officer, they take an oath to protect the public and quite clearly, Carroll failed in that public duty. 'Carroll's drug addiction . significantly clouded his judgement, so much so that he passed a . prohibited weapon to a drug dealer in exchange for drugs. 'He . also seriously neglected his duties as a police officer leaving the . station while on duty and the force area so he could attempt to buy . drugs from Jermaine White. 'That . is not the sort of behaviour the public, or Greater Manchester Police, . expects from a serving officer and as a result, not only has he now been . convicted of a number of serious offences, but he has lost his . reputation and the respect of his colleagues. 'Greater . Manchester Police's Professional Standards Branch is here to protect . the public. The branch has a crucial role to play in ensuring that . officers and staff uphold the very highest standards of behaviour and . when there is evidence of criminality or misconduct, we will take . action. 'We must always remember that we police with the consent of the public, so I want to both warn officers and staff, and reassure our communities, that if we uncover any evidence of any GMP employees engaging in criminal activities or committing misconduct, that we will carry out a thorough investigation and regardless of rank or position, we will pursue these matters through the courts.'","Judge jails Pc Robert Carroll of Greater Manchester Police for 14 months .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Lenient sentences are fuelling the cannabis trade which is now more serious than dealers of Class A drugs, a senior police officer has warned. Andy Wards, assistant chief constable for Merseyside police, revealed there had been an ‘explosion’ in production of cannabis causing serious problems for officers. Gangs were exploiting the cannabis market believing they are less likely to be caught and if they are they will receive softer sentences. The the last three years police in the North West have uncovered more than 5,000 cannabis factories . Anyone caught dealing Class B drugs, including cannabis, face a maximum prison sentence of up to 14 years or an unlimited fine, compared to life in prison for dealing class A drugs such as cocaine or ecstasy. Mr Ward said: ‘There has been an . explosion in the market for cannabis. Unlike class A drugs, which the . criminals can’t make themselves, there is the opportunity to grow . cannabis in the bathrooms or bedrooms of houses. ‘They can make a lot of money very quickly at less risk [to themselves] and less risk in terms of sentencing.’ Assistant chief constable Andy Ward of Merseyside police said the cannabis trade is now worse than that for Class A drugs . Shootings were increasingly linked to cannabis deals, he added, as he appealed for courts to hand out tougher punishments. ‘Criminals who have previously been involved in something else are drifting into the cannabis world. The amount of money being made by criminals should be reflected in the sentencing.’ More than 5,000 cannabis factories . have been uncovered by police in the North West in the last three years, . containing 350,000 plants, The Daily Telegraph reported. Mr Ward chairs the North West . Regional Organised Crime Unit and is also head of Merseyside’s Matrix . Unit, which was set up to combat drug and gun crime. He . added: ‘A lot of these shootings are linked to activity around . cannabis. We are seeing big increases in cannabis production on . Merseyside. Individual groups are fighting turf wars. ‘We have huge issues around cannabis.’ Lee Donafee, the network director for the Merseyside Inclusion Network, works with young people to deter them from a life of crime. ‘The kids say it's easy money to go round selling drugs,’ he said. ‘We make them aware of what can happen if they follow the wrong path.""","Senior Merseyside officer says cannabis trade now worse than that for Class A drugs .

"By . Ian Ladyman . David Moyes has reminded Wilfried Zaha that he is a Manchester United player after telling him he cant yet go on loan. The United manager met the young winger on the training field yesterday and told him that he would not consider him for a move away from the club until fellow attackers Nani and Ashley Young were fit. Moyes denied reports of a row between him and the youngster but has stressed in no uncertain terms that Zaha's obligations are to United. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Tony Pulis say Crystal Palace would be up for Zaha loan . Staying power: David Moyes has told Wilfried Zaha that he cannot leave Manchester United on loan . Bench mark: Zaha, pictured with Shinji Kagawa (left), has not started a league game under Moyes . Moyes said ahead of tomorrows game at Chelsea: 'Wilfried Zaha has a chance. 'I have told him that if I can’t get him the games I will put him out on loan. 'But he can’t go out while we have Ashley and Nani injured and I would be surprised if anyone thought was a possibility.' Cardiff City have been strongly linked with a loan move for Zaha, who has hardly played under Moyes this season. Asked if he had argued with Zaha on . Friday, Moyes said: 'I had 30 seconds chat on the training pitch today . and we were talking away. So there was nothing like that. 'I have indicated to the boy (that he can go on loan when others get fit). 'But he is a Manchester United player, that’s what he is.' Opportunity knocks! Moyes claims Zaha has a chance when United take on Jose Mourinho's Chelsea . Since Alex Ferguson paid £15million to bring Zaha from Crystal Palace last January, the England winger has only played a meagre 167minutes on the pitch. Speaking in October, Moyes said: ''Wilf has not appeared. We have not felt we have had the opportunity. I want Wilf to get used to what happens here. 'The competition is hard. It is important Wilf gets to see the level of the training here, the level of the players and the quality they have got. He is getting better.’ Despite his underwhelming start, Gareth Southgate insists it is too early to write off Zaha's career at Old Trafford. ‘I am sure in time he . will be an asset for Manchester United but I guess everything there with . the new manager and everything, everybody is getting used to a new way . of working,' said the England Under 21 manager. Not the right time: Zaha will be allowed to leave on loan if United's injury problems ease . Moyes has confirmed that several teams are interested in taking Zaha on loan - with former club Crystal Palace the most prominent, although manager Tony Pulis has revealed that Moyes does not want the player to return to London. 'We’ve spoken to David Moyes about Zaha and I don’t think he’s too keen on him coming back to London,' he told talkSPORT in January. 'It’s . not a problem for us, he’s a Manchester United player. We don’t think . it’s a goer, although we were very keen if there was a possibility to . take him on.' Wilfried Zaha has played a mere 28 minutes in the Premier League for Manchester United in two cameo substitute appearances - and he had to wait for December for his first top-flight match. Dec 7: Man Utd 0 Newcastle 1 (22 mins) Dec 15: Aston Villa 0 Man Utd 3 (six mins) He has not really made an impact in those games, having just 29 touches in 28 minutes. He has had one (off-target) shot, and has tried just 11 passes, completing 64 per cent of them. Most surprisingly for Zaha, given his style of play, he has attempted just four dribbles and only one of those has been a success. His one cross also came to nothing.","Moyes has reminded Zaha he is a United player and will not leave on loan .

"By . Martin Allen . Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. In this week’s column he gets behind beleaguered Sam Allardyce, notes Adam Lallana is ready to get on that plane to Brazil and reveals whose leg looks like a slice of stilton! When your key players are missing as a manager, whether it's in schoolboy football, pub football or at semi-professional level, you don't win games. It's as simple as that. Emotionally that's difficult for supporters to accept. Hold tight: Sam Allardyce was right to write off the FA Cup because he has a depleted squad at West Ham . I fully understand why Sam Allardyce felt the need to write off the FA Cup game away at Nottingham Forest and you would have to be mad to have expected any different result in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at the Etihad against Manchester City. The dogfight to avoid relegation will go right down to the wire. The compensation figure to pay off Allardyce and his staff will be better off spent trying to hook a few loan players to come to West Ham to help strengthen their squad and save their season. He knows what he's doing. Timely boost: Andy Carroll made his first team return during the impressive win away at Cardiff on Saturday . Think! Despite bad results recently, the compensation money to sack Allardyce is better spent on signings . Manchester City smashed seven past Norwich, Arsenal and Spurs were hit for six, Manchester United and Newcastle conceded four and they played a half-strength team away to Bayern Munich – the Champions League winners – and beat them 3-2. They taught Allardyce's West Ham a lesson, too. It's easy to say you should be doing this and you should be doing that, but the City players are faster, stronger, far superior technically. It looks like Manuel Pellegrini has harmonised the expensive squad with calmness, confidence and a management style which is very different from Roberto Mancini. Calmness personified: Manuel Pellegrini's cool demeanour has settled the Manchester City squad down . Adam Lallana is technically good enough to get into Roy Hodgson's squad for the Brazil World Cup and mentally he looks to have the confidence and arrogance to make the step up to get on that plane. He showed that again with his well-taken goal to beat West Brom on Saturday. It looks like he believes he's good enough and it looks like he believes he should be going. This mental hurdle is the most significant thing to overcome when you get to the top level. Boy for Brazil: Adam Lallana has produced a number of eye-catching performances for Southampton . Cheers mum! The playmaker scored against West Brom and is in contention to go to the World Cup . The England cricket team have looked inferior in recent weeks and have been verbally beaten with barbed comments from Australia that have weakened their squad and dissolved self-belief. They fought to take the Ashes back from us. Lallana is fighting for his place, with that Aussie spirit. Jose Mourinho, Rafael Benitez, Arsene Wenger, Brendan Rodgers, Mark Warburton – what do they all have in common? None of them played football at a decent level but are making it as managers. They've been to university, done this course and that course. Back in my playing days if you didn't play at the top level, you had no chance. We're laughing! Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers are from the managerial breed who never made it playing . Not even Jason Puncheon's penalty miss against Tottenham. But I'll tell you what, I've got a lot of respect for Jason (right). My . friend Ray asked me if I'd seen the worst penalty ever shortly after it . happened. He laughed as he explained that the penalty kick nearly hit . the floodlights. I . reminded him that Puncheon used to play at my old club Barnet and had . spells at Southampton, MK Dons, Blackpool; 11 clubs in total. And I also . reminded him that in his time Puncheon had been in trouble with the . law. He was arrested in connection with a robbery seven years ago – but not convicted – and used to hang around with a bad crowd. I admire Puncheon for not only turning his life around but also for maximising his undoubted ability, and . for the courage and guts to take responsibility to grab that ball and . take the penalty in the first place. My friend Ray just nodded in . agreement. My old club Brentford appointed a . manager a few weeks ago who has never played professional football. Mark . Warburton had been a trader in the City when he started work at the . Watford academy coaching, training and developing the youngsters and . bringing through some good young players. He moved to Brentford to work as director of football operations for his friend and very wealthy owner Matthew Benham. Benham has invested heavily throughout the club and in a few years' time Brentford will be playing in a brand new 20,000-seater stadium in a prime location. Mark has just won League One Manager of the Month and got the record of six straight league wins - the best start of any Brentford manager - and the team are flying at the top of the division. Gone are the days that if you had 50 England caps you got a manager's job. Now, you need to be up to speed with strength and conditioning, in-depth match analysis, have excellent communication and man-management skills, be good at delegation, international recruitment, nutrition, counselling... the list goes on and on and on. Watch out for the rise of Brentford Football Club and Warburton. New kid on the block: Brentford are flying at the top of League One with Mark Warburton in charge . The players, supporters and owners of clubs at the bottom of League Two will be anxiously looking over their shoulders and scared stiff of the prospect of going to play in the Conference next year. It's a good league, with lots of good professionals in it that have had to drop down with the influx of so many foreign players in the top leagues. To get out of it, you need a mixture of David Blaine, Dynamo and John Still – the Luton manager who is five points clear at the top. Once you're in it, don't expect to come back too quick! Eyes down! Northampton Town caretaker Andy King is trying to keep the struggling club in League Two . I see in the news that Thomas Hitzlsperger became the first Premier League player to come out as gay last week. I don't think anyone cares, in this day and age, about homosexuality. Who is seriously bothered about it? No one is nowadays. It's all part of life and the world we live in. Who cares? Thomas Hitzlsperger came out as gay last week but modern society is beyond such prejudices . I now have the time to try to lose some weight and to help in my quest I joined the local gym. I enrolled myself into a fitness class for a 10 o'clock start last Wednesday morning to do yoga. I . thought yoga was just stretching to improve flexibility and mobility, . but as I lay there doing my utmost to loosen my hamstrings I couldn’t . help but notice the lady next to me had a stilton leg – there were blue . veins all over it. She . managed to stretch her hamstring, by pulling her straightened leg all . the way back over her head, but I couldn't stop thinking how much it . looked like a block of stilton cheese. I . was sweating, a little bit embarrassed and, as I kept staring at the . blue veins, knew it was about time I got myself into shape.","Sam Allardyce made the right decision to field a weakened cup team .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida police officer was arrested Tuesday night after allegedly posing as a teenage girl on Facebook in order to get photographs of naked boys. Michael Gerard Stavris II, 30, of Palm Coast, was arrested on two counts of computer pornography under the child exploitation prevention act and one count of criminal use of personal identification information. The arrest was a long time coming. According to officials, the police sergeant had been posing as a girl for more than a year. Sgt Michael Gerard Stavris: A Florida police sergeant who once worked as an after hours school cop in Jacksonville is charged with soliciting high school boys for sex by posing as a teenage girl on a fictitious Facebook profile . According to the felony warrant issued March 25, Stavris allegedly created a fictitious profile on Facebook profile of a 16-year-old girl on November 25, 2012. Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents began investigating Stavris in December 2013 after receiving a complaint. Stavris allegedly created a fraudulent Facebook account using someone else's image in order to pose as a teenage girl. Agents said he used the fake account to solicit teenage boys and then began to turn the conversations into those of a sexual nature before requesting sexually explicit photos. The 6-foot-3, 400-pound man promised to perform oral sex on his victims in exchange for the pictures and even sent a picture of a woman's breasts to one victim. The officer befriended at least 30 teenagers in the process, some of whom attended Flagler Palm Coast High School, where Stavris graduated from in 2002. Calculating: Officer Stavris used his fake teenage girl Facebook profile to befriend at least 30 teenagers in the process. Some of them were students at his old high school, Flagler Palm Coast High School, from where he graduated from in 2002 . Posing as a girl, he asked for pictures of their penises. After the victims sent the photos, 'she' promised to perform oral sex behind their schools. The affidavit said that in one case, a student was asked to meet if he would send the 'girl' a picture of his genitals. According to the arrest report, he would solicit the male victims through the Facebook page and discuss what sexual acts they had committed. The page had between 30 to 40 friends younger than 18. Stavris, a sergeant with the Bunnell Police Department, was arrested at the Bunnell City Hall, where all of the government offices are located. He was booked and then released on a $125,000 bond. The charges carry a penalty of five years in jail. 'We will do everything in our power to see that all potential victims are identified and this person is charged with each crime that's committed,' said Dennis Bustle, special agent in charge of the FDLE's Jacksonville regional office. Stavris worked as a patrol officer for the Duval County school system from October 2009 to July 2010, school officials said. His job began after school hours were over and involved patrolling and responding to school-related calls citywide, . Before becoming a police officer, Stavris worked for the Flagler County school system from 2000 to 2006 teaching activities and safety to children through the eighth grade, said his Duval County school board personnel file.","Sgt.

'There's one thing I can tell you for sure ... people will move,' Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser who is close to the Obamas, told The Associated Press. Jarrett wouldn't comment on reports that Beyonce, who also is close to the Obama family, will sing at the first lady's party. Beyonce serenaded the Obamas as they danced at one of the balls for the president's first inauguration in 2009.

New York money manager David Winter, founder of Wintergreen Advisers, claims there's 'no reasonable basis' for the lavish proposed payouts and is urging fellow shareholders - including Warren Buffett - to vote down the decision at Coke's upcoming annual meeting. In letter issued to shareholders, multimillionaire Winter wrote: 'We can find no reasonable basis for gifting management 14.2 percent of the share capital of Coca-Cola, worth $24 billion at today's share price.' Too much: New York money manager David Winter, pictured, founder of Wintergreen Advisers, claims there's 'no reasonable basis' for the lavish proposed payouts and is urging fellow shareholders to vote it down . He called the 'gifting' unnecessary and . said in the letter, obtained by ABC News, 'It is unfathomable that they . would require such astronomical sums of money to provide motivation.' Winter goes on to claim the compensation proposal shirks shareholders and puts the 'economic well-being of management far ahead.' Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, holds around 9 percent of Coke's stock and Winter sent him a personal version of the note requesting him to similarly oppose the plan. Winter himself has 2,479,843 shares in the company. According to ABC, Buffett has not yet replied. In a statement Coke argues that the $24billion pat on the back is not a given, but that management will be required to meet specific goals and financial targets to be eligible. Winner: Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of the Coca-Cola company, is among executives who will benefit from the eye-popping payouts . And those targets include delivering for shareholders. Coke also says the proposed rewards will not just be handed out to senior executives but to a larger group of employees as a talent retention policy. Coke's board, which includes Howard Buffett, Warren's son, backs the compensation plan. But Winters reiterated to ABC News that 14.2 percent is over-the-top. 'We believe that's too much. It's a tough headwind (for the stock) to overcome,' he told the network. He adds that only 6,400 staff will be eligible to benefit out of 151,000 employees, which each standing to get about $2 million each, on average.","New York money manager David Winter, founder of Wintergreen Advisers, claims there's 'no reasonable basis' for the lavish proposed payouts .

EMS spokesman Nick Martin said 18 people were taken to hospitals but he said he had no information on their conditions other than they were taken to four hospitals across the city. Boston Fire Department spokesman Steve MacDonald described the blaze as a nine-alarm incident, the . department's highest level of severity - drawing more than 150 firefighters and 30 trucks to the scene. The nine-alarm fire erupted at  2:43 p.m. and caused huge eruptions of flames from the roof of the four-story building, along with a massive column of smoke, according to pictures released by the Boston Fire Department. 'The fire right now is still not out. It is still . raging from the inside,' MacDonald told reporters. 'It's a very unstable . condition right now with the flames that are through the roof, and it's . hard fighting it from the outside.' Blaze: More than 150 firefighters from the Boston fire department rushed to battle the inferno that broke out in the densely populated Back Bay neighborhood . Injured comrade: Firefighters and emergency medical personnel rush a firefighter from the scene of a multi-alarm fire at a four-story brownstone in the Back Bay neighborhood near the Charles River, on Wednesday, March 26, 2014, in Boston . One witness, Kayla DaSilvia said she saw emergency workers battling to save the life of a fellow firefighter. 'They were doing compressions on him. They were trying to get him in an ambulance,’ she said to the Boston Globe. 'It was really chaotic ... The smoke was really thick.’ Of the three firefighters . brought to area hospitals, one was listed in serious condition while the . injuries to the other two were not believed to be life-threatening, . MacDonald said. Firefighters were focused on keeping the blaze . from spreading to neighboring buildings on a day the city was buffeted . by high winds, MacDonald said. Live television video showed an . enormous plume of smoke rising from the building, and hovering over the . city. State police said they closed a major roadway along the Charles . River behind the burning building. Control: The firefighters of the Boston FD battle to keep the flames from spreading across the densely populated neighborhood . An assistant district attorney was being sent to the scene, standard procedure in cases in which there are serious or potentially life-threatening injuries, said Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Dan Conley. There was no immediate word on the cause of the fire. Despite strong winds and cold temperatures, people gathered to watch firefighters work from outside the building. 'The smoke was unbelievable,' said Kayla Dasilva, who lives a few blocks away and went with her roommate to see what was happening. Gilad Haas said that he saw firefighters battling the flames and then saw what he thought was an blast. 'I saw this explosion,’ Haas said at the scene. 'It was a burst, and then I saw the flames go up. It was definitely scary. I have such respect for the fire department.’ Injured hero: Firefighters and emergency medical personnel rush a firefighter from the scene of the nine-alarm fire in Boston on Wednesday afternoon . Two members of the Boston Fire Department became trapped in the building's basement - but managed to escape - their condition is unknown. The fire was fanned by wind that was gusting at up to 40 mph - producing a huge cloud of black smoke that was visible across the city. Jack Mahoney, registrar at the nearby Newman School on Marlborough Street, told the Boston Globe, 'We can see, feel, and smell the fire.' 'Smoke is in the alleyways. It’s everywhere.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Three people have been accused of stealing bronze vases from the grave sites of babies and military veterans to sell as scrap metal. Marissa Dawn Savage, Brian Keith Hicks and Samantha Diane Mathis have each been charged with  two counts of theft by taking, for allegedly stealing 29 vases from Georgia's Hill Haven Cemetery. Although the vases were worth about $500 each, the alleged robbers only made about $65 in total before they were caught by a potential buyer. The alleged offenders . Charged: Brian Hicks (left) and Samantha Nathis (right) have been accused of stealing 29 vases from Hill Haven Cemetery .

Rita White's grandson died in her daughter's arms seven hours after he was born in 1991, and he was buried at Hill Haven Cemetery. White said when she discovered thieves had vandalized the little boy's grave, she re-lived the grief she experienced more than 20 years ago. 'That's where we come to have peace and think about him. It's been a long time but he was still our baby,' she told My Fox Atlanta. 'My daughter and I both have cried about this (the thefts) because that was my first grandbaby. That was her first baby. And to think that people are that low that they would do something like that.' Cemetery owner Betty Cornett said she was disgusted that anyone would rob a grave. 'They got $65 for I don't know how many vases. It's stupidity,' Cornett said. 'That . just broke my heart because I've lost a baby. I know how that feels. I . am just amazed that people are that low that they would something like . this from babies and veterans.'

"By . William Turvill . and Daily Mail Reporter . The Chicago train operator who derailed a commuter train sending it up an escalator was asleep at the wheel and had been caught nodding off at work on a previous occasion, it has emerged. The operator admitted the frightening lapse, which saw 30 people injured, during interviews with investigators, Ted Turpin from National Transportation Safety Board announced today. 'She did admit that she dozed off prior to entering the station, and she did not awake again until the train hit close to the end of the bumper,' Turpin said. Scroll down for video . Sleepy: The operator admitted the frightening lapse, which saw 30 people injured, during interviews with investigators, Ted Turpin, pictured today, from National Transportation Safety Board announced . 'This time, she woke up when she hit.' But it wasn't the first time she fell asleep while driving, he said. The woman, who hasn't been identified, had been admonished just last month for missing a stop because she had dozed off. 'She did tell us that, in February, she dozed off and passed a station without stopping. CTA became aware of that almost immediately, and a supervisor admonished her and had a discussion with her,' Turpin said. He said she told investigators she woke up 'just a little past the station' but was unable to open the doors. Turpin said the woman was hired by the CTA in April and began training to be an operator in October. She had been working just 60 days when the awful collison took place, mainly as a fill-in driver so her schedule was iregular, he said. The news comes as it was revealed the commuter train was not speeding and emergency brakes on the tracks were activated but failed. Dangerous: This photograph shows the scene at the O'Hare International Airport terminal after the collision, which was caused by a sleeping driver . Lucky: More than 30 people were injured during the collision at 3am on Monday but thankfully none died . More than 30 people were injured in the . collision at O'Hare International Airport after the train derailed and . barreled towards the entrance to the terminals shortly before 3am on . Monday. Amalgamated Transit Union Local 308 President Robert Kelly said earlier that the operator told him she had worked a lot of overtime recently and was 'extremely tired'. 'The indication [that she dozed off] is there, yes,' Mr Kelly said during a news conference Monday. 'She has worked a lot of hours in the past weekend, and the indication is there.' Ted Turpin said a preliminary review had shown the train was operating at 25mph, the correct speed, as it entered the station, according to Newser. Investigators have yet to say whether the driver attempted to apply the in-cab brake. Mr Turpin said that 'all we know factually' is that an automatic emergency braking system on the tracks was activated but did not stop the train as it arrived into the station. The president of the Chicago transit union said there were indications the train driver had fallen asleep . The lead investigator is planning to determine how rested the driver was at the time of the incident . Although she had had 17 hours off . before starting her shift on Sunday night, Mr Kelly said she had been . working a lot of overtime. 'So she had an ample amount of time to be off that day,' Mr Kelly told the Chicago Tribune. 'I do know she works a lot, as a lot of our members do.' After the crash, she immediately got off the train began checking on passengers. The driver was treated for an injury to her leg and released from a local hospital. According to the Tribune, the driver underwent routine drug and alcohol testing. Martinez Butler, a train engineer for another company, said he witnessed the collision. 'There was a train that was stopped at the station. Another train came through and looked like it blew the signal, because I heard beeping,' she told NBC Chicago. 'I'm a locomotive engineer. I know the systems, I know the sounds. 'When you hear those beepings it's warning you that there is an obstruction in front of you and you need to stop.'","The operator admitted the frightening lapse, which saw 30 people injured, during interviews with investigators .

"By . Associated Press . Mantecore, the white tiger that injured Roy Horn on a Las Vegas stage over a decade ago, has died. He was 17. A statement released by illusionist duo Siegfried & Roy on Tuesday said the tiger died from an illness on March 19. No other details were provided. The average lifespan for such a tiger in captivity is 15 to 26 years, according to the San Diego Zoo's website. Legendary: Siegfried, left, and Roy, seen in 2009, had a popular Las Vegas show until Roy was attacked on stage in 2003 . Big cat: A white tiger called Montecore, ended up attacking Roy during a performance of the magic show in 2003. Here it is pictured at its enclosure in Las Vegas . Parnters: American entertainers Siegfried Fischbacher, left, and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn. Mantecore, the tiger that injured Roy Horn over a decade ago, has died. He was 17 . Horn was injured by the 380-pound tiger called Mantecore, whose name is often referred to as Montecore, during a live Siegfried & Roy performance at the Mirage hotel-casino in Las Vegas in 2003. Horn, 69, and partner Siegfried Fischbacher, 74, have said they believe Mantecore sensed Horn was having a mini-stroke and was dragging him to safety, rather than attacking him. Animal experts have disputed that theory. Roy was left seriously injured after being grabbed by the throat. He was told he would never walk, talk or perform magic again, but defied all odds to make a remarkable recovery, despite having to have part of his brain cut away, suffering a crushed windpipe and being partially paralyzed. The friends, who were famed for their magic show that incorporated a menagerie of elephants, tigers and lions into illusion acts, ended their famed Mirage show in 2003. After a run of 30,000 shows that were watched by up to 400,000 people each year, the showmen decided to retire from their Las Vegas production. Roy admits that he was a 'little bit handicapped,' by the incident that both deny was an attack by their white tiger. 'I can do a lot of things. I can walk, I can go swimming, I can go to the gym, I can go shopping,' he told a magazine last year. Habitat: Even now the illusionists look after tigers at Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat at The Mirage Hotel & Casino . Great white cat: A statement released by illusionist duo Siegfried & Roy on said the tiger died from an illness on March 19 . Close call: Roy is rushed to hospital in October 2003 after being grabbed by a tiger at the Mirage . After a two-year review, federal investigators never determined what set off the tiger. 'I will forever believe it was his concern for my safety and well-being that caused him to act as he did on that night long ago,' Horn said in a statement. 'We spent many hours together and he never failed to bring me great joy and wonderment. It was my great honor to be beside him at the end. He is now playing with his siblings in white tiger heaven.' 'Farewell my dear friendâ€¦..know that your image is forever burned into my heart,' Roy wrote in an emotional Facebook post. Horn's injuries left him partially paralyzed and led to the closing of Siegfried & Roy's successful Vegas show. During Horn's long rehabilitation, both he and Fischbacher remained devoted to The Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat, their exotic habitat on the Las Vegas Strip that houses lions, tigers and leopards. Horn noted that there are 11 white tigers and two white lions residing at the habitat after Mantecore's death.

"By . Belinda Robinson . A Montana woman who was due to be sentenced on Thursday for pushing her new husband to his death in Glacier National Park wants to withdraw her guilty plea to a second-degree murder charge. Jordan Linn Graham, 22, wants the change because prosecutors are still recommending life in prison, even though second-degree murder would normally carry a lesser sentence. Her defense attorney Michael Donahoe said in a motion that her ‘extremely reckless but unintentional act’ only warranted 10 years in prison. New plea: Jordan Graham wants to withdraw her guilty plea as she 'unintentionally' pushed her husband off a cliff days after their wedding . Donahoe said the request for a life . sentence shows that prosecutors' offer to dismiss the first-degree murder . charge was an ‘empty promise’ and a way to avoid a possible verdict of . manslaughter - a less serious offense than first or second degree . murder. The plea agreement was reached in December after the trial testimony was complete but before closing arguments were held. Graham, of Kalispell, was charged with killing Cody Johnson on July 7, eight days after the two married. Johnson's body was found at the bottom of the cliff three days after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker. Unsure: Prosecutors said she pushed Cody Johnson because she was having doubts about their marriage . Happier times: An image from their wedding on June 29 shows the couple days before his death . Graham . said at her trial that she was having second thoughts about being . married so young and they went to the park to talk about it. They went over a . retaining wall along the Going-to-the-Sun Road and climbed down a rocky, . steep slope to the edge of a cliff and a steep drop of a couple hundred . feet to a ravine. There, . facing the void, she told Johnson that she wasn't really happy and that . she was not feeling like she believed she ought to be married, . she said. They . argued. It escalated, culminating with Johnson grabbing her, Graham . said. She thought he was going to pull her toward him - and that's when . she became angry. 'I wasn't thinking about where we were,' she said. 'I just pushed.' She . said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one . hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder, and he went over. It . wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an . extreme disregard' for life. Afterward, she ran back to where the car . was parked. She had the keys in her pocket. Previous plea: Graham is pictured here with her defense attorneys Michael Donahoe, left, and Andy Nelson, as she leaves court in Missoula, Montana . Heartbreak: Cody Johnson's mother Sherry broke down outside the court following Graham's guilty plea in December last year . She drove back home to Kalispell, about an hour away, without seeking help. She sent text messages to friends on the drive back - but told nobody what had just happened. 'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said. She . didn't tell anybody what had happened, instead making up a story that . Johnson had gone for a ‘joyride’ with friends from Washington state. That story unraveled when the versions she told to friends, relatives and authorities didn't match.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated Press Reporter . A 27-year-old Pennsylvania woman's viral Facebook quest to find her birth mother who had abandoned her as a baby in a Burger King bathroom has finally paid off. Katheryn Deprill announced Tuesday that she was reunited with her biological mother for the first time Monday . in an attorney's office, with the meeting leaving her in a state of 'pure joy.' 'She . is better than anything I could've ever imagined. She is so sweet and . amazing. I'm so happy,' said Deprill, who became known as the Burger . King Baby after she was found wrapped in a shirt and crying on the bathroom floor of the fast food eatery in Allentown. Happy reunion: Katheryn Deprill, pictured in her viral Facebook photo, finally met her . biological mother who had abandoned her in a Burger King bathroom for the first time Monday in an . attorney's office . Deprill began her quest March 2 by . posting on her Facebook page a photo in which she held up a sign that . said: 'Looking for my birth mother. ... She abandoned me in the Burger . King bathroom only hours old, Allentown PA. Please help me find her by . sharing my post.' The photo . was shared more than 30,000 times by Facebook users around the world, . and Deprill's story landed in numerous media outlets. That caught the . attention of the woman claiming to have abandoned her, and she came . forward to attorney John Waldron, who arranged for them to meet. Deprill said she bears a very strong resemblance to the woman, whose name she wouldn't disclose. 'It looked like I was looking in a mirror,' she said. Deprill, . an EMT and married mother of three who lives outside Allentown in South . Whitehall Township, said she embraced her mother. 'I . got the hug that I had wanted for the last 27 years, and that broke the . ice,' she said. 'I asked if I could have it, and she said, ""absolutely,"" and just held her arms open, and the rest is history.' The pair met for about four hours and exchanged contact information. Deprill said they plan to meet again. 'We are definitely going to have a relationship,' she said. Found: An image taken by Deprill's adopted family shows her as a baby in 1986 after she was found . Scene: When she was found in this Burger King in Allentown, she was believed to be just hours old . Discovery: A worker indicates the place where the baby was found wrapped in a shirt and crying . Waldron . told WFMZ-TV that the woman said that, as a 16-year-old girl, she was raped by a stranger . while traveling abroad with her family and became pregnant. The woman said she hid the . pregnancy from her parents because she was ashamed and, when she gave birth at home, felt she could not . take her newborn to the hospital. ‘She left me somewhere she knew I'd be found,’ Deprill said. ‘She did not want to throw me away.’ Waldron said the woman, who is married, recently had launched her own search for the daughter she gave up. Deprill said her mother expressed regret during their meeting. Deprill said she forgave her '110 per cent, absolutely.' Speaking to WFMZ Tuesday, Mrs Deprill described her long-lost parent as a 'normal person,' ‘sweet’ and 'very loving.' Attorney John Waldron, who organized the reunion in his Allentown officer just before 2pm Monday, told the station that Deprill's headline-making Facebook plea has made the search easier, but it also 'scared Mom a bit' because she wanted to stay out of the limelight. After the 'emotional’ get-together, Deprill said her birth mother was very upset that she had to leave her as a newborn, and that it was not what she wanted. The 27-year-old woman added that her mother quickly caught wind of her social media campaign, but decided to seek legal advice first instead of reaching out to her right away. Hitting headlines: The story made headlines as authorities tried to track down the mother - but could not . Home: An image in Deprill's baby scrapbook shows her with her adopted mother, Brenda Hollia . The Monday meeting was also attended by Deprill's seven-month old son and her adoptive mother. One of the reunion's objectives was for Deprill to learn about her medical history, and she said that her mother provided her with all the information she needed. The unnamed woman said that she hopes to be involved in the lives of Deprill and her family going forward. Deprill, who was about three hours old when she was found, was adopted by a local foster family and she has since gone on to marry, work as an emergency medical technician and have three children of her own. She told WFMZ earlier this month that she wanted to find her birth mother to ask questions she had always had about that day - and because she had always wondering if she had any siblings. 'I really want to see her and just . ask her why and see if I have any brothers and sisters and anyone that . looks like me,' Deprill said. Support: Hollis said she was excited by the thought of her daughter finding her birth mother . Deprill's adoptive mother Brenda Hollis said she fully supported her daughter's plan. 'I think it's just kind of fun, like . there's so many questions to be asked and it's just, I am so excited . about it,' she told WFMZ. A . massive search was launched to find Deprill's mother after she was . dumped in the Burger King, which is still standing in Allentown. A worker told . police he could remember seeing just one person who might fit the . profile: a woman in her early 20s, with collar-length, frizzy sandy . brown hair, the Morning Call reported. He added that she was driving a blue 1970s car and that she'd headed south after leaving. At the hospital, a nurse guessed that . the baby was probably about three hours old. From how the umbilical cord . was tied, investigators guessed that whoever delivered the baby had . done so before. Investigators dusted for fingerprints, . searched trash cans, interviewed witnesses and followed up on seemingly . promising tips - but nothing led them to the mother.

"By . Associated Press . The Transportation Security Administration recommended Wednesday that airports post armed law enforcement officers at security checkpoints and ticket counters during peak hours. The recommendation was one of 14 determined after a nationwide review of security at airports prompted by a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport last fall. The 25-page report to Congress was obtained by The Associated Press. Congress will now consider the recommendations. Extra security: The Transportation Security Administration is recommending beefed-up police presence at TSA checkpoints and ticket counters during busy times at airports, the agency said in a report released Wednesday . The AP has reported that the two armed officers at the LAX terminal had left for breaks and were out of the terminal. Airport police decided months earlier to have officers roam terminals instead of staffing checkpoints such as the one approached by a gunman. The Transportation Security Administration conducted its own review of security at nearly 450 airports nationwide after the Nov. 1 shooting at LAX killed TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez â€” the agency's first line of duty death. Checkpoints: The review was compiled after a deadly November 2013 shooting at Los Angeles International Airport . Paul Ciancia opened fire with an assault rifle in an attack targeting the TSA, authorities said. Two officers and a passenger were wounded. The Pennsville, N.J.-native has pleaded not guilty to 11 federal charges, including murder of a federal officer. Dozens of groups including law enforcement, airline and airport operators have met multiple times since the Nov. 1 shooting to discuss suggestions to improve airport security. Report recommendations include requiring TSA employees go through active shooter training and participate in related training exercises. The TSA also recommends acquiring panic alarms for areas for areas were gaps have been identified. The Associated Press has reported that though TSA officers told airport officials that an officer hit the panic button, there was no evidence it happened. An airport-wide audit of red phones and panic buttons found some of those devices weren't working properly, including in Terminal 3. A TSA supervisor picked up an emergency phone but fled the gunman. The airport police dispatcher only heard shouts and gunshots because the phone system didn't provide a location. Deadly: Two other officers and a passenger were wounded in the shooting at LAX airport on November 1 . Security lapse: Several people were hurt by gunfire including a TSA officer (pictured in the center) at Los Angeles International Airport last November when a lone gunman armed with an assault rifle went on the rampage . Because officers weren't in the terminal, an airline contractor called police dispatch directly on his cellphone, alerting officers nearly a minute and a half after the shooting began. Other recommendations include conducting a minimum number of active shooter training and exercises annually and extending the temporary redeployment of special teams to conduct random security sweeps. Los Angeles World Airports, which operates LAX, released its review last week that found the airport's emergency response was hindered by communication and coordination problems. The 83-page report spotlighted flaws in various airport divisions and systems that were in place, but didn't single out individuals responsible for problems. It also made no mention of the two armed officers who were out of position without notifying dispatchers as required or the policy change to roaming patrols months earlier.","The TSA's review was conducted in the wake of a November 1st shooting .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . New York state has the most segregated public schools in the nation, with many black and Latino students attending schools with virtually no white classmates, according to a report released Wednesday. The report by the Civil Rights Project at the University of California at Los Angeles looks at enrollment trends from 1989 to 2010. In New York City, the largest school system in the U.S. with 1.1 million pupils, the study notes that many of the charter schools created over the last dozen years are among the least diverse of all, with less than 1 per cent white enrollment at 73 per cent of charter schools. There's also a marked difference at the city's nine specialized schools, designed to prepare students for college. Anyone living New York City can attend these schools, but they must get a high score on a standardized exam administered in the eighth grade. Alike: A new report by the Civil Rights Project revealed that New York State's public schools are the most segregated in the nation. Above a chart showing the uniformity in race at public schools . At elite Stuyvesant High School in lower Manhattan, just seven black students and 21 Latino students were admitted this year compared to the 164 white students and 680 Asian students. It was the same story at Bronx Science, which admitted 557 Asian students, 252 white students, 50 Latinos and 18 black students, according to data reported in Dropout Nation. 'To create a whole new system that's even worse than what you've got really takes some effort,' said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project and an author of the report. He and his fellow researchers say segregation has the effect of concentrating black and Latino students in schools with high ratios of poor students compared with the statewide average. Black and Latino students who attend schools that are integrated by race and income level perform significantly better than their peers in segregated schools, the authors note. The study suggests that New York's segregation is largely due to housing patterns but that it could be mitigated through policies intended to promote diversity. Separation: Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School is one of the most segregated schools in New York state, with just 8 black students admitted to the college preparatory this year. Above, students leave the lower Manhattan campus on March 25 . Elite: Stuyvesant High School is one of New York City's nine specialized schools. Any New York City resident can attend the school, but they must secure a high score on an eighth grade placement exam . 'In the 30 years I have been researching schools, New York state has consistently been one of the most segregated states in the nation — no Southern state comes close to New York,' Orfield said. Other states with highly segregated schools include Illinois, Michigan and California, according to the Civil Rights Project. In New York, about half of the state's public school students were from low-income families in 2010, the report says, but the typical black or Latino student attended a school where close to 70 per cent of classmates were low-income. The typical white student went to a school where just 30 per cent of classmates were low-income. 'For New York to have a favorable multiracial future both socially and economically, it is absolutely urgent that its leaders and citizens understand both the values of diversity and the harms of inequality,' the study's authors say. New York City Department of Education spokesman Devon Puglia did not address the findings of the report, but said, 'We believe in diverse classrooms in which students interact and grow through personal relationships with those of different backgrounds.' In this Dec. 3, 2013 file photo, Adofo Muhammad, center, principal of Bedford Academy High School, teaches 10th and 11th graders in his Global Studies class in the Brooklyn Borough of New York . State Education Commissioner John King called the findings troubling and added, 'The department has supported over the years various initiatives aimed at improving school integration and school socioeconomic integration, but there's clearly a lot of work that needs to be done — not just in New York but around the country.' The report, which used U.S. Department of Education statistics, also noted increasing segregation in upstate cities including Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse. In the Syracuse metropolitan area, the report says, the number of black students increased by 4 per cent between 1989 and 2010, but black isolation increased dramatically. In 1989 the typical black student went to a school that was one-third black, but in 2010 the typical black student went to a school that was nearly half black. Pedro Noguera, a New York University education professor, said it's disturbing that policy makers have focused so little on racial integration in recent years. Desegregation: Institutionalized segregation in America's schools became illegal with the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Above, Linda Brown attends her new, majority-white, school in September 1954 . 'We've been talking about reforming schools in New York and elsewhere. This issue was never addressed,' Noguera said. He added, 'When you concentrate the neediest kids together in under-resourced schools they tend not to do very well.' The UCLA report recommends that state and local education agencies develop policies aimed at reducing racial isolation and promoting diverse schools. The report suggests voluntary desegregation programs in upstate cities like Rochester, where low-income populations are surrounded by more affluent communities. In New York City, Orfield said, a system of unscreened 'choice' schools would foster more diversity than the current New York City high school choice system, which sees entrance tests at top schools excluding most black and Latino students. 'If you just offer choice, the people with the best information will get into the best schools,' he said. Requel Russell-George, the mother of two students at Public School 169 in the Bronx, which has about 75 per cent black and 19 per cent Latino students, said she feels the school is 'excellent' but she would like to see more diversity. 'I do feel that it would be great for our children and other children to be exposed to other cultures,' Russell-George said. 'You're more knowledgeable and things are not mysterious to you as you get older.'","The segregation is most prominent in New York City charter schools where white students account for just 1 per cent of enrollment .

"By . Lydia Warren . A Catholic school teacher who was fired for being pregnant and unmarried has given birth to a son. Shaela Evenson, who was dismissed from Butte Central Elementary School in Montana in January, and her partner, Marilyn Tobin, welcomed Brody Tobin Evenson on March 7. The child - the couple's first - was born weighing 6lb 15oz, the Montana Standard reported. The parents' joy comes after a troublesome few months for the family, after Evenson was dismissed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena on January 10. New addition: Shaela Evenson, left pregnant and right with her partner Marilyn Tobin, has given birth to a baby boy two months after she was fired from her teaching job for being pregnant and unmarried . The diocese received an anonymous letter . saying the teacher was pregnant, administrators decided to fire her not . based on her merit but because her pregnancy violated their belief . system. They said Evenson, who has taught literature and physical education at the school for nine years, had violated her employment contract, in which she agreed to follow Catholic teachings. Evenson, 36, is not a Catholic herself. Her attorney, Brian Butler of Ohio, filed a discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier this month. He argued an employer . can't require employees to waive their rights under anti-discrimination . laws - including a woman's right to bear children. New parents: The baby boy, who was born March 7, is the first child for Tobin, left, and Evenson, right . Both Butler and Superintendent Pat Haggarty said Evenson was not fired for being a lesbian. 'They . told her she was fired for being pregnant and unmarried,' Butler said. 'Nobody was hiding anything. (Shaela) never denied the fact that sheâ€™s . in a relationship with Marilyn.' Her firing led to outcry among the community and across the country, and a GoFundMe page was set up to help her and Tobin, a former Montana Tech coach, with their family's costs. It has so far raised around $2,000. 'Besides being an outstanding educator and an inspiration to her young students, Shaela is in a long-term, committed relationship,' it explains. 'This pregnancy is hard-fought and very much wanted.' The social justice group Faithful America and the teacher's friends, Susan Hawthorne and Margaret Rankin, also delivered a petition with 22,000 signatures to Bishop George Leo Thomas of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena weeks after her firing. Dismissed: She was dismissed from Butte Central Elementary School, pictured, after 9 years of teaching . 'Firing an unmarried teacher for becoming pregnant is cruel and hypocritical,' said the petition. 'Give Shaela Evenson her job back, and start taking Pope Francis' words about love and healing more seriously.' Some Catholics pointed out that even Pope Francis has been signalling lately that unwed mothers should not be shunned by society. Last month, the pontiff baptized a child born out of wedlock inside the Sistine Chapel, and in September, he offered an unmarried woman who had chosen not to have an abortion to personally baptize the baby.","Shaela Evenson, 36, was fired from Butte Schools in Montana after someone tipped off the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Trapped: Akifa Khatun, 19, stopped growing just before her second birthday and must be carried everywhere by her mother Apila, 42 . At first glance Ajifa Khatun could be any little girl, playing with her brothers and sisters and getting a hug from her doting mother. But although Ajifa looks like a toddler, she is in fact 19, having stopped growing just before her second birthday. Ajifa weighs just 1st 3lbs, and still needs to be spoon-fed and carried everywhere by her mother Apila, 42. The teenager was a healthy baby when she was born in 1994 and it wasn't long before she started to walk and talk. However, her development then stalled. Doctors initially told her mother and father, Sekh, 52, that Ajifa would start growing again. They then blamed cancer for her condition, before suggesting that it could be a hormone disorder and the family are still at a loss as to why Ajifa is how she is. Scientists believe that Ajifa could have Laron Syndrome, a rare genetic condition, which is believed to have affected just 300 people across the globe - with a third of them living in in remote villages in Ecuador’s southern Loja province. People living with Laron lack a hormone called Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, or IGF-1, which stimulates the cell to grow and . divide to form new cells. Too much of the hormone can lead a person . to develop breast, prostate or bowel cancers at an early age, meaning people with Laron will never get cancer, or diabetes. 'Ajifa is likely to maintain her childlike features for the majority of her life,' Tam Fry from the Child Growth Foundation told The Sun. Mr Fry believes Ajifa 'probably' has Laron Syndrome. Brothers and sisters: Ajifa (front) with her siblings (left to right) Danish, eight, Rabiya, 14 and 17-year-old Rini . Ajifa's younger sisters Rini, 17, Rabiya, 14, and brother Danish, eight, now tower over her, while her vocabulary extends only to 'maa', for mother, 'baba' for father, and 'didi' for sister. She is physically and cognitively similar to a two-year-old, and has an IQ of less than 20. Her condition bears an uncanny resemblance to a US woman, Brooke Greenberg, who died in October last year aged 20 after puzzling doctors for years. No formal diagnosis for Brooke’s condition was ever given, leading doctors to term it 'Syndrome X'. Friends: Ajifa passes the time playing with local children, only able to take a few baby steps without help . Instead of going to school or out to work like her peers and siblings, Ajifa, who lives in Mirapar, West Bengal, India, passes the time playing with local children, only able to take a few baby steps without help. 'She's a delight and always has a smile on her face, but it's heartbreaking to see her trapped in this life,' Mrs Khatun told The Sun. Her father said his 'beautiful' daughter is always smiling and brings joy to her family. 'She doesn't communicate much but she knows what's going on around her,' he said.

No formal diagnosis for Brooke's condition was ever given, leading doctors to term it 'Syndrome X' Theory: Scientists believe that Ajifa could have Laron Syndrome, a rare genetic condition, which is believed to have affected just 300 people across the globe - including these people in Ecuador . An Ecuadorian man with Laron Syndrome (pictured with his children in the early 1990s) Scientists have suggested that Ajifa Khatun could have Laron Syndrome, which has been diagnosed in just 300 people across the globe. The syndrome is named for  Israeli endocrinologist Zvi Laron, who in the late 1950s began studying patients, some with childhood diabetes and others with growth and sexual development disorders. His earliest patients included three young siblings—two boys and a . girl— all with severely stunted growth. They were all obese, with thin . hair, pronounced foreheads, and a collapsed nasal bridge, and their . grandparents were first cousins. Laron assumed they had a severe . shortage of growth hormone, but some years later, after new blood tests . were developed, it transpired the levels of growth hormone were . abnormal—they were extremely high. By the mid-1960s he had . identified 20 more such people. He reasoned that either they had . defective hormones, or something was wrong with the cells that respond . to those hormones. People who inherit the rare genetic condition do not produce a hormone called Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, or IGF-1, and are completely free of two of the most debilitating illnesses - diabetes and cancer. It is IGF-1, not growth hormone, that stimulates the cell to grow and divide to form new cells. Too much of the hormone can lead a person to develop . breast, prostate or bowel cancers at an early age. Scientists are now developing a drug which they hope will do artificially . what the genetic defect in Laron Syndrome does naturally -  protect . against DNA damage that fuels cancer growth. People with Laron Syndrome are in perfect proportion but grow only to an average height of 4ft. A third of those diagnosed live in remote villages in Ecuador’s southern Loja province.","Ajifa Khatun, 19, is is physically and cognitively similar to a two-year-old .

The images, taken by a concerned employee over several days in November, show workers hunched over at their desks with their eyes closed. The staff man the lines at a critical emergency dispatch center in Miami Beach, which handles about 170,000 incidents a year for the fire and police department. Shocking: This photo taken in November allegedly shows a supervisor dozing next to the employee she was training . As the photos were circulated on Local10 news station, experts have warned that the behavior could put lives at risk. 'This job can go from zero to 60 in a matter of seconds. You need to be awake and alert. Someone could miss a call for assistance,' a retired dispatcher, who asked not to be named, said. The employee who took the photos claimed that in one image a supervisor is pictured napping alongside the woman she was training. He claimed it wasn't unusual to see staff sleeping at their desks and that a manager had been made aware of the situation. Asking to remain anonymous, the employee added that the department was understaffed and claimed everyone was forced to work overtime. The claims were backed by a retired dispatcher, who claimed staff did 'forced overtime'. Nap time: A Miami Beach 911 dispatcher is pictured, above, seeming asleep in front of her computer . Dozing off: Another employee who appears to be sleeping is pictured, above, in a photo taken by a concerned dispatch worker .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and James  Nye . New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio admitted at a news conference on Wednesday that more could have been done to help residents living in the Upper East Side during Tuesday's snow storm . New York mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged on Wednesday evening that there were flaws in his administrations response to the snowstorm which descended on the city on Tuesday causing transport chaos on the city’s roads. Facing one of the first flashpoints of his weeks-old tenure, de Blasio initially defended what he called a ‘coordinated, intense, citywide response’ to a storm he said caused a worse-than-expected headache when it ramped up at rush hour. De Blasio, who campaigned on closing the gaps between rich and poor city residents, at first rebuffed complaints that the effort had lagged on Manhattan's posh Upper East Side, saying ‘no one was treated differently.’ But he backtracked on Wednesday evening, saying he'd determined ‘more could have been done to serve the Upper East Side.’ Thirty more vehicles and nearly 40 more sanitation workers were sent to the area to finish the cleanup, de Blasio said in a statement that noted he still felt the citywide response, overall, ‘was well-executed.’ In a city where snow removal has proven a political hot potato, the flap was almost a mirror image of complaints about how de Blasio's predecessor, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, handled a 2010 blizzard.

"By . Belinda Robinson . Death: Jeffrey Ferguson is shown before his execution in this March 17, 2014 photo provided by the Missouri Department of Corrections . A man convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing a 17-year-old girl made funny faces and mouthed words at his own daughters minutes before he was put to death last night. Jeffrey Ferguson, 59, was executed by lethal injection just after midnight on 26 March at the state prison in Bonne Terre, Missouri. He was accused of kidnapping Kelli Hall as she finished her shift at a Mobil gas station in St. Charles, Missouri on Feb. 9, 1989. Her naked, frozen body was found 13 days later on a St. Louis County farm, and police determined she had been raped and strangled. Her killer was animated just before his execution as he lay strapped to a hospital gurney. He had enjoyed a final meal he ate barbecue ribs, French fries and apple pie. To ease the tension, he made funny faces and mouthed words to relatives, who included his two daughters, sitting in the observation room. As the lethal drug was administered, he took a few deep breaths before becoming still, and his daughters cried as he closed his eyes. He was pronounced dead at 12:11 a.m. In his final statement, Ferguson said: ‘I'm sorry to have to be the cause that brings you all into this dark business of execution. I pray for the victim's family to have peace in their hearts one day and lose the anger, hate and need for revenge that has driven them.’ The victim's father Jim also witnessed the execution along with his son and ex-wife, who fought back tears as he described how Ferguson strangled his daughter as he raped her 25 years ago. He said it took ‘way too many years’ to put him to death. 'This basically tore two families apart,’ he said after Ferguson's execution. ‘Hopefully, now we can move forward. ... Kelli can rest now.’ On the night of the murder, Ferguson and a friend, Kenneth Ousley, were at a Shell service station across the street from the Mobil gas station where Hall worked. Strapped in: Jeffrey Ferguson was animated just before his execution as he lay strapped to a hospital gurney . The teenager was nearing the end of her eight-hour shift when she went outside to check the levels of four fuel tanks. A witness said Ferguson's Chevrolet Blazer pulled up and a man standing close to Hall had his hand in his pocket. Investigators said Ferguson was carrying a pistol. About a half-hour later, co-workers went looking for Hall and contacted police when they realized she wasn't home and her purse was still at the station. Some of her clothes were later found in another town. Nearly two weeks later, on Feb. 22, 1989, Warren Stemme was approaching a machine shed on his farm in Maryland Heights, another St. Louis suburb, when he found Hall's body, naked except for socks. Murder: Kelli Hall was finishing her shift at a Mobil gas station in St. Charles, Missouri on Feb. 9, 1989 when  she was kidnapped . An acquaintance suspicious about Ferguson led police to him, and he was convicted of first-degree murder. Meanwhile, Mr Ousley pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 1993; he is serving a life term but is eligible for parole. Jim Hall said Wednesday that his family will fight to make sure Mr Ousley is never paroled. In an attempt to spare Ferguson's life, his attorneys made last-minute court appeals challenging, among other things, the state's refusal to disclose where it gets its execution drugs. Mugshots: Supporters said Ferguson was remorseful and became deeply religious in prison . Supporters also said Ferguson was remorseful, became deeply religious in prison, counselled inmates and helped start a prison hospice program. His attorney also said he was an alcoholic who blacked out the night of the murder. ‘Society doesn't gain anything by his execution,’ Rita Linhardt of Missourians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, said Tuesday. ‘He's not the same man he was 24 years ago.’ But St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said Ferguson's good deeds in prison didn't make up for the senseless killing of an innocent teenager. He noted that it took several minutes for Hall to die. ‘She gets abducted, abused in an unspeakable manner by this guy and then slowly murdered and dumped in a field like a bag of garbage,’ McCulloch said. And the courts appeared to agree: the U.S. Supreme Court, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the governor all refused to halt the execution. Missouri switched to a one-drug execution method late last year. The state obtains the drug, pentobarbital, from a compounding pharmacy that it refuses to name. Ferguson's attorney, Jennifer Herndon, had argued that the state's secretive process prohibited the public from knowing exactly how the drug was made and whether it could cause pain and suffering for the inmate. The same drug was used in the state's four previous lethal injections. Like Ferguson, those inmates also showed no outward signs of distress during the execution process. Missouri executed just two men between 2005 and November. But after the state switched from a three-drug execution method to a single-drug protocol last year, executions resumed. Although critics have raised concerns about the drug and the secretive ways Missouri obtains and uses it to kill inmates, more executions are likely. Experts say as many as 20 of Missouri's 41 death row inmates have exhausted appeals and could also face execution dates soon, perhaps making 2014 the most prolific year ever for executions in the state. Missouri executed nine men in 1999, the most-ever in a single calendar year. On Friday, the Missouri Supreme Court set an April 23 execution date for William Rousan, who killed a St. Francois County couple, both in their 60s, in 1993.","Jeffrey Ferguson, 59, was executed by lethal injection at the state prison in Bonne Terre, Missouri .

The 34-year-old claimed the patrons began to insult her and shout obscenities out of the blue, simply because she was wearing the head-mounted computer and camera. However, new footage Slocum posted to her YouTube channel on the weekend shows Slocum may added fuel to the attack by cursing at a woman, sticking up her middle finger and loudly saying, 'I want to get this white trash on tape for as long as I can.' It is at that point that a young man, clearly tired of the altercation, tried to rip the Google Glass off Slocum's head, telling her to, 'Get out of here!' New footage: Graphic content warning . New video: Sarah Slocum has released new footage of the night she was allegedly assaulted, which shows her and an unknown female (center) exchanging  barbs . Antagonistic: During the altercation, Slocum stuck her middle finger up at a woman who she says abused her . Over it: When Sarah Slocum says, 'I want to get this white trash on tape for as long as I can', this young man reaches for her Google Glass and tells her to, 'Get out of here' Slocum told SFGate she only started filming and name-calling after being insulted. 'They instigated the fight,' she said. 'I'm only going to put up with so much abuse.' She said she posted the new video because she wanted to be transparent. At the time of the incident, Slocum claimed she was simply showing friends how to use the new technology when she was attacked. However, witness Brian Lester, told CBS San Francisco that Slocum was being irritating, filming people on the device without their consent. 'The crowd was jeering as any last call crowd would do with a fight outside of a bar,' Lester said. 'She was running around very excited ... and people were telling her, 'you're being an ***, take those glasses off'. 'I . think everybody was just upset that she would be recording outside of a . bar this late with obvious embarrassing behavior going on. And just . rather insulted that someone thinks it's okay to record them the entire . time they're in public.' Sarah Slocum . Two sides: Sarah Slocum (pictured) has maintained she was the victim of a February 22 bar attack, but footage shows she cursed and berated her alleged attackers . Opportunistic: After the February 22 dispute at Molotov's bar, Sarah Slocum (pictured) was quick to parlay the skirmish into appearances on CNN and 'Inside Edition' The . altercation came just a week after Google released a list of dos and . don'ts for Glass users including 'don't be creepy or rude (aka, a . 'Glasshole').' Following the infamous bar feud, Slocum became an unofficial ambassador of Google Glass. While some in the tech community have applauded her unapologetic embrace of the new technology, others have accused her - and people like her - of being a 'Glasshole'. Even the woman filmed at Molotov's appears to have jumped on the anti-tech bandwagon, caught on camera telling Slocum, 'You're killing the city', a reference to a larger backlash against tech workers in San Francisco. Original footage . Footage: Slocum captured the images of people she accused of attacking her in a San Francisco bar with the Google Glass she was wearing . Slocum's infamous bar feud has raised questions internationally about privacy and its limits. Now, with so much scrutiny, embarrassing . events from Slocum's past have begun to surface, including various . restraining orders filed against her. CBS San Francisco recently reported that Slocum was served a restraining order in August 2012 after admitting to secretly recording her neighborsâ€™ conversation through an open window in Santa Cruz, California. Jessie Lilley Campbell told the media outlet she made her scuffle with Slocum public 'because I wanted people to know that Sarah Slocum is no victim'. Campbell . said she and her husband David Campbell have since relocated to another . part of Santa Cruz, even though the restraining order against Slocum is . still in effect, just to 'get away from her'. Slocum, however, has maintained . the recording she made was from a place that was legal and she did it . because her 'hippy biker neighbors' were talking about her. Slocum was living on a cabin on the same property as the Campbells, Baltimore Sun reported. 'It was a spat with . neighbors. That lady also recorded her husband (with her . cellphone) chasing a friend of mine with an axe,' Slocum said. 'I walked by their place on the way to my cabin, their window was open . and I could hear them from the driveway. I heard them talking about me . and conspiring against me so I started recording to capture what they . were saying so that I could show it to my friends and family.' Former neighbors . Court action: Slocum's former neighbors, Jessie Lilley and David Campbell, took a restraining order out against Slocum in 2012 which is still in effect . Meanwhile, SFWeekly has reported that court records from San Mateo County showed a restraining order was granted against Slocum in 2011 following accusations of domestic violence made by her mother, Maya Slocum. 'My mom and I have gotten into a few physical disputes,' Slocum said. 'That's between us. We're on good terms now.'","Social media consultant Sarah Slocum was showing off the high-tech glasses in punk rock bar Molotov's in San Francisco on February 22 .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . New parents of rare identical triplet girls have revealed that they use a pink Sharpie marker on the babies' feet to prevent a mix-up. Chad and Amanda Doss from Franklin, Indiana, welcomed their daughters - Avery, Bentley and Cassidy- two months early on December 30. They were finally reunited as a family at home after a prolonged hospital stay on January 29. Speaking to Today.com about the difficulty of telling their look-a-like 12-week-old infants apart, Mrs Doss, 27, said: 'We keep their initials with Sharpie on the bottom of their feet just in case.'' Which is which? New parents of rare identical triplet girls Chad and Amanda Doss have revealed that they use a pink Sharpie marker on the babies' feet to tell them apart . She added that the girls do have tiny differences which mark them out. For instance, one of Bentley’s eyelids has a red mark, and Cassidy has a visible vein on her nose. However the Dosses realize that these facial features could disappear overnight and want to be prepared for this eventuality. Every night after bath time they reach out for the Sharpie and marker each baby up. The couple, who have been married three years, are now a family of . seven in a three-bedroom home. Mr Doss has two children from a . previous marriage, Caleb, 12, and Kaitlyn, nine. Come in threes: Avery, Bentley and Cassidy - born on December 30 - defied the one-in-100-million genetic odds . 'The best day ever': Doctors believe that the egg split into three soon after conception in Mrs Doss' (pictured holding Bentley) womb . He revealed in January that he and his wife's triplet daughters were conceived naturally after a vasectomy reversal. He underwent the procedure in 2012 with the hope of starting a family with his second wife and was shocked by its efficiency . 'It’s . beyond [a] miracle . . . It’s unbelievable,' he exclaimed. 'To feel . them in my stomach for so long and to finally be able to see them was the best day ever' Mr Doss' urologist gave him about a 66per cent chance of being able to father a child within the first five years of getting his vasectomy reversed. The surgery can take up to three to four hours and prices range from $5,000 to $20,000 depending on its complexity. 'We were thinking, we’ll try for one and grow our family just a little bit,' Mr Doss recalled. His wife said she was overjoyed when she learned she was pregnant. But when doctors confirmed there were three identical girls, '[that] was just the icing on the cake,' she exclaimed. Overjoyed: Mr Doss underwent a vasectomy reversal in 2012 with the hope of starting a family with his second wife and was shocked by its efficiency . The Doss' newborns stayed at the neonatal intensive care unit inside St. Vincent Women’s Hospital . in Indianapolis until they had reached a healthy weight. Mr . Doss . said: 'It’s unbelievable that let alone we had a reversal, but . then for us to have three and they’re identical, it’s a miracle. We’re . very blessed.' Dr. Charles Coddington, a reproductive endocrinologist and president of Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, said naturally occurring identical triplets are so rare there are no studies that establish how often it happens. 'It’s unbelievable that let alone we had a reversal, but . then for us to have three and they’re identical, it’s a miracle' Various experts calculate the odds from one-in-one-million to . one-in-100-million. Doctors . believe that the egg split into three soon after conception because the . babies shared a placenta and chorionic sac but had their own amniotic . sacs. Mrs Doss gave birth at 31 weeks just three months after a routine ultrasound revealed that she was carrying three babies. She told the Indy Star: ‘It was just crazy to see three babies in three beds sitting here and doing well. ‘Seeing . them for the first time was a very overwhelming experience, to feel . them in my stomach for so long and just wonder what they will look like . so to finally be able to see them was the best day ever.’ Instant family: Mrs and Mr Doss, who has two children from a previous marriage (pictured bottom with Mrs Doss), have had to trade in their two cars to buy a minivan to make way for their growing family . After . more than a month’s bed rest, Mrs Doss was admitted to hospital in . early December. There she felt contractions but progress was slow until . her waters broke around midday on the 30th. Within an hour she had given . birth to three baby girls. She said: ‘It was definitely just like in the blink of an eye that it happened.’ The Doss girls were named for their position in the womb though they were not delivered in ABC order. The . first to arrive was Avery, who weighed 3lbs 15oz; followed by Cassidy . at 3lbs 11oz; and last came Bentley, the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz . The Doss', who married in 2011, traded in their two cars to purchase a minivan for their suddenly big family. Mrs Doss concluded: 'For the most part, it’s not as . difficult as I thought it was going to be. 'I pictured . mass chaos in my head. Now, at this infant stage, they’re pretty easy to . take care of.'","Chad and Amanda Doss from Franklin, .

"By . Shari Miller . A devoted brother who spent more than 60 years searching for his lost family, finally traced his siblings - and found they were living just doors away from one another. Fred Hodgkins, 76, grew up knowing that he had a brother who was given away for adoption during the Second World War. His mother Gladys, from Sheldon, Birmingham, had fallen pregnant with a son, Grahame, while her husband - also called Fred - was away on service in Egypt. Reunited: Siblings Fred Ford, Carole Cox and Fred Hodgkins finally met again after 60 years apart . Grahame was put up for adoption and named Fred Ford by his adoptive parents. But unknown to Mr Hodgkins, his mother fell pregnant a second time and gave birth to Carole 18 months later. She was was given to Gladys' best friend Connie Atkins, and her husband Bert, who were unable to have children. 'I remember coming home from school when I was five years old and there was a rifle and kit bag at the bottom of the stairs,' said Fred Hodgkins Junior, who now lives in Nuneaton with his wife Barbara. 'I thought my dad was home. But instead my mother was upstairs with another man. 'It always stuck in my head, but my mother never said anything about it. 'Months later, I came home from school again to find my mother upstairs holding a baby. My gran and my aunt were there, too. 'Mum said: 'We've only borrowed this little boy' and I held him in my lap. I knew deep down that he was my brother - but I never saw him again.' The family were bombed out three times during the war - first in their home in Sheldon, then at Fred's grandmother's house in Ward End, and again at his aunt's home in Small Heath. 'I've never recovered from that,' says Fred, who received a neck injury during the first blast. 'It was terrible.' His father Fred, by now a sergeant major in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, returned from a five-year stint abroad in 1946, and the family moved to his grandmother's home in Ward End. Sibling love: Fred Hodgkins and Carole Cox found each other after a lifelong search . After a turbulent reunion, Fred and Gladys went on to have another daughter named Pat. Mr Hodgkins recalls: 'There was nine of us living in the three-bedroom home. No-one had houses any more - they'd all been bombed.' He married Barbara in 1959, moved back to Sheldon and became the landlord of various Birmingham pubs. Both his parents died at the age of 65, in 1977 and 1978. Mr Hodgkins first learned that he had another sister in the 1980s when he was told by an aunt. He tried to search for his adopted siblings, but without success. Then, in 2008, he received a call from an agency saying his brother Fred Ford had made contact - and wished to speak to him. Mr Ford, now 70, had moved to Pembroke Dock in 1984 to run a pub with his wife Jane - but she tragically passed away from cancer in 1995, aged just 46. 'Fred Ford and I spoke over the phone and the next day he came up from his home in Wales,' says Fred, who now has two sons, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. 'We got on so well that he stayed for the weekend.' Mr Ford, who lives with partner Jeanette and has two sons and three grandchildren, said of his remarkable reunion: 'I knew my birth mother's name and where I was born, so I tried to look for her many years ago,"" he says. 'But I got nowhere. I got fed up and left it. 'Then, around six years ago, as a result of my cousin looking for his relatives, I got in touch with an agency. 'Within two weeks they came back to me, saying I had two brothers and two sisters. We are family: Fred Hodgkins and Carole Cox were put in touch through an agency called After Adoption . Round the corner: The siblings are pictured on the corner of Cranes Park Road, where they were born and Ivydale Avenue, where Carole grew up . 'My head was spinning. I never knew I had any siblings. 'I . got Fred's phone number and thought I'd give him quarter of an hour to . ring round his siblings to tell them about me before I called. 'But just . then the phone rang and it was Fred, saying: 'I've been looking for you . for years.' 'We got on really well. He's Fred No 1 because he's the eldest and I'm Fred No 2!' 'We . were both amazed by the number of co-incidences in our lives. Not only . were we both brothers named Fred, but we had also both worked as . licensees. 'And, although I was raised in Leamington Road, Sparkbrook, . when I married I bought a house on The Glade, off Coventry Road, Sheldon . - just a stone's throw from where I'd been born."" Family photo: Fred and his younger brother with their mother, Gladys Hodgkins, pictured in 1942 . The brothers finally managed to trace their sister Carole, who was living in Redditch, through an agency in Birmingham called After Adoption. Fred Hodgkins says: 'We all met at my house and it was marvellous. She came with her husband and son, and our brother Fred came, too. 'It turned out Carole grew up in Ivydale Avenue, just around the corner from Cranes Park Road in Sheldon. 'She had walked past our house every day going to school, but I had never known who she was. 'Years later, she and her husband Ken used to drink in the Marston Green Tavern, where I was the landlord. 'I felt as though a part of me had been missing before I met Fred and Carole. 'Now it's as if we'd never been apart, even though more than 60 years had gone by. I look back and feel sad that we didn't meet years ago.' Today the two Freds Skype each other every morning, Carole calls regularly, and they meet for lunch most Sundays. Carole, 68, who has also met her other sister Pat and spoken to brother Bob on the phone, said: 'I'm really glad I know the story now. 'I'm sure lots of adopted people think 'My mother didn't want me then, why should she want me now?' 'But there's always a reason. 'My . birth mother had a husband so she couldn't keep the two of us. When I . learned she'd given me to her best friend, I thought that was lovely. 'I'm lucky, I've had a really good upbringing, I've always been really happy. I was brought up round the corner from where I was born. 'I feel sad that I never met my mother, especially now I know she didn't want to give me up. But it's lovely to have this family now.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Police say a man walked out of a New Jersey prison after serving 15 years for robbing a children's shoe store, headed straight back to the same shop and robbed it again. In 1999, Christopher Miller - then 25 - was arrested after he forced employees into the back room of the Stride Rite shoe store on Hooper Avenue in Toms River, tied them up and fled with cash. After serving a 15-year sentence, Miller was released on Friday from South Woods State Prison in Bridgeton, NBC reported. Police say Miller, now 40, took a bus from Atlantic City to Toms River on Saturday, and went to the same shoe store. Re-offending at its worst: The day after Christopher M. Miller finished a 15-year prison sentence for robbing a Stride Rite store in Toms River, he committed an almost identical crime at the same store, police said . Employees tell police that he entered the store at 4.21pm and demanded cash, telling the workers - a 17-year-old boy and 43-year-old woman - to go to the back room. He was not believed to be armed and the workers refused to follow his orders. He became agitated, according to police, and took the cash register drawer, which had $389 inside. He then took the workers' cell phones, the store phone and fled on foot. The employees still managaed to call 911 and police responded immediately. Police say they found Miller a few blocks away, with the cash stashed in a gutter and the phones in a garbage can. Toms River Police Chief Mitchell Little says he has to wonder whether Miller considers prison life home. On Saturday, Miller took a bus from Atlantic City to Toms River, returned to the same Stride Rite store at 1358 Hooper St, and committed a second robbery . Just as he did in 1999, Miller demanded the Stride Rite workers to go to the rear of store, however they refused. Miller was not armed, it is believed . 'Maybe that's the only life he knows, and the only thing he could think of was going back to the same store and doing the same crime again - getting caught and going back where he was taken care of and told what to do and getting meals and shelter and everything else,' he said. Police say Miller lists Tulsa, Okla. as his last address. His connection to Toms River is not clear. He is charged with robbery - again - and is being held on $100,000 bail. Back in 1999, Miller was sentenced to 15 years in prison for for three armed robberies in Toms River and Brick, as well as theft, criminal restraint and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes.","Christopher Miller robbed the Stride Rite store in Toms River, New Jersey, in 1999 .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and Snejana Farberov . A former girlfriend testified Tuesday that an Army soldier on trial for murder told her to expect 'a lot of money' just hours before his pregnant wife was suffocated to death during a sex game — leaving him to collect $500,000 in insurance and benefit payments. A military judge heard a second day of witness testimony in the court-martial of 22-year-old Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, who faces an automatic life sentence if convicted of killing his wife, Sgt. Deirdre Aguigui, at their apartment on Fort Stewart July 17, 2011. He is also charged with causing the death of their unborn child. Money trail: An ex-girlfriend of Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, pictured at his preliminary hearing on August 30, 2012, testified that the soldier told her to expect 'a lot of money' just hours before his wife was suffocated to death ¿ leaving him to collect $500,000 in insurance . Expectant mother: Sgt. Deidre Aguigui, 24 (pictured left and right in 2011) was seven months pregnant when she was found dead July 17, 2011, with abrasions on her wrists in her bedroom strewn with sex toys . Samantha Thacker said she met Aguigui in 2010 as he spent the summer training in Arizona. She said they had already started a romance by the time she learned he was married, but said he promised her a divorce was pending. Thacker said they were still in close touch a year later, and on the day Aguigui's wife died, he had sent her text messages. 'One of them said he was coming into a lot of money and I would never have to work,' Thacker said on the witness stand. She said when she later learned Aguigui's wife was dead, he said if she was killed in a car crash. Prosecutors say Aguigui's rocky marriage and the hefty insurance payout prompted him to kill his wife, who was about seven months pregnant. A former Army buddy testified Monday that Aguigui told him that he handcuffed his wife during sex and suffocated her by putting a plastic bag over her head. Aguigui has pleaded not guilty. Under questioning by his defense attorneys, Thacker noted Aguigui's text message didn't specifically mention his wife or insurance money. Aguigui (right), pictured here in 2011 with his co-defendant Sgt Anthony Peden (left), is already serving a sentence of life without parole in a Georgia state prison after he pleaded guilty last year in a double slaying . Army investigators say Aguigui told them he had woken up from a nap to find his wife dead on the couch. Paramedics found marks on her wrists, but no other obvious wounds. Military police found a pair of handcuffs on the couple's bed, along with a number of other sex toys scattered around the room. Aguigui told them he had cuffed his wife during consensual sex earlier in the evening, before he nodded off for a nap, said Justin Kapinus, the Army's lead investigator on the case. 'He stated that she enjoyed being tied up and that night they used the handcuffs,' Kapinus said. 'He said she enjoyed having her hands behind her back and laying on the handcuffs.' Aguigui is already serving a sentence of life without parole in a Georgia state prison after he pleaded guilty last year in a double slaying that occurred nearly five months after his wife's death. Civilian prosecutors say he used the $500,000 in insurance money to buy guns and bomb-making parts for an anti-government militia group called F.E.A.R. (short for Forever Enduring Always Ready) that Aguigui formed by recruiting disgruntled soldiers. Civilian authorities say Aguigui ordered the deaths of former soldier Michael Roark and his girlfriend, Tiffany York, in December 2011 to protect the group and its plans. F.E.A.R members had stockpiled assault weapons and bomb components and discussed plotting attacks on a crowded landmark in nearby Savannah, poisoning the apple crop in Washington State and even assassinating President Barack Obama. High stakes; Aguigui, seen in court in July 2013, faces an automatic life sentence if convicted of killing his wife . Aguigui and three other soldiers were jailed about a week after Roark and York were shot to death in rural Long County near Fort Stewart. More than a year passed before the Army charged Aguigui in his wife's death in April 2013. Pfc. Michael Burnett has also pleaded guilty in the deaths of Roark and York. The two soldiers accused of firing the killing shots — Pvt. Christopher Salmon and Pfc. Michael Burnett — are still awaiting trial. Friends of the Army couple testified during a pre-trial hearing last week about constant fighting in their marriage over Aguigui's drug use and infidelities by both husband and wife. Deirdre Aguigui, 24, was about seven months pregnant when she died, and friends said her husband had questioned whether the child was his. Radicalized: Aguigui, pictured at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, allegedly founded an anti-government militia group called F.E.A.R . Isaac Aguigui called 911 on the evening of July 17, 2011, saying he found his wife unconscious and unresponsive on the couch, with chunks of a potato she'd eaten for dinner in her mouth, Kapinus said. When she died, Deirdre Aguigui had small cuts and abrasions on her wrists and investigators found a pair of handcuffs on the bed, according to the Army criminal investigator. The bed was also covered with sex toys, leg restraints and other paraphernalia. The investigator said Isaac Aguigui told investigators he and his wife had used the handcuffs and other items during sex a few hours earlier. Kapinus said he suspects the bedroom scene was staged. He said, 'It seemed excessive.' Aguigui's friend Michael Schaefer testified that Aguigui at first told him his wife died from a blood clot.About a month later, after they had been up all night using cocaine, they got into an argument.Schaefer said he asked his friend point-blank what really happened to his wife. 'He told me he had strangled her with a bag,' Schaefer said. 'He handcuffed her, put a bag over her head and strangled her' while also sexually assaulting her. An autopsy failed to reveal whether an attack, illness or some other cause killed a pregnant Army soldier whose husband is charged with killing her, a military medical examiner testified Tuesday. Two days after Mrs Aguigui died, an autopsy conducted at the southeast Georgia Army post found bruises on her wrists, arms, head and back, as well as bruising inside her mouth. But there was nothing to indicate what caused most of the injuries and none were fatal, said Lt. Cmdr. Lisa Rivera, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy. More victims: Michael Roark, 19 (left) and his girlfriend Tiffany York, 17 (right) were found shot in the head in December 2011 to stop them from revealing F.E.A.R.'s illegal activities . Combination photo of Isaac Aguigui (L-R, top row), Christopher Salmon, Michael Burnett (L-R, bottom row) and Anthony Peden pictured in this Long County, Georgia, Sheriff's Office booking photograph . Rivera found no tell-tale signs of illness, allergies or toxins. She even ruled out rare disorders linked to pregnancy such as bubbles in the blood and infections of the uterus. Rivera's testimony sets up a case of dueling expert opinions that could prove be key to the trial, which will be decided by a military judge instead of a jury. Prosecutors charged Isaac Aguigui with murdering his wife last year after a Georgia state medical examiner offered a second opinion and concluded his wife died from asphyxiation while being choked or smothered. Dr. James Downs was scheduled to testify later. ‘In my opinion, while there are a constellation of blunt force injuries, I did not find definitive evidence of asphyxia in this case or any other cause of anatomic death,’ said Rivera, who insisted she couldn't even determine if the woman was killed or died from natural causes.","Pvt.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The parents of a 24-year-old military policeman shot dead by a civilian at Virginia's Naval Station Norfolk on Monday have opened up about their heartbreak for the first time. While the Navy has not officially released the victim's identity, Decondi Mayo and Sharon Blair said naval officers told them on Tuesday that their son, Mark Mayo, was killed in Monday's attack. Mayo was chief of the guard aboard the USS Mahan, a guided-missile destroyer, when a civilian gained access to the ship and disarmed a sailor. Mayo was shot as he rushed to help the sailor. 'Just put there he died a hero,' Blair said, according to Herald Mail-Media. 'He was at work. The line of duty.' Tragic: Mark Mayo (pictured left and right) has been identified as the victim of a Naval Station Norfolk shooting . Heartbroken: The parents of Mark Mayo, Sharon Blair (pictured left with Mark) and Decondi Mayo (right), have confirmed their son was the victim of Monday's fatal shooting . Write caption her . Loving family: Sharon Blair said her son Mark Mayo (pictured together) was devoted to his family and often went to the movies with her . Blair said before she knew anything about the shooting, she began to feel sick. She said her son, a Williamsport High School graduate who made a name for himself as a standout wrestler, was devoted to his family and often went to the movies with her. Blair said her son had been a military policeman since completing special forces training in 2008 and patrolled the base. He'd been stationed in Bahrain and Spain before patrolling the U.S. Navy base in Norfolk. Blair said her son was born in Washington, D.C., but she moved her family to Hagerstown in 1998 for a better life. 'I wanted to do right by them,' Blair said. Scene: Mark Mayo was chief of the guard on board the USS Mahan, a guided-missile destroyer (pictured) docked at Naval Station Norfolk on Monday when he was shot dead by a civilian . USA Today reported the tragic events unfolded about 11.20pm Monday when the quarterdeck on USS Mahan noticed a civilian behaving erratically. As several security officers confronted him, the civilian stripped the gun . from the Petty Officer of the Watch and shot Mayo as he rushed to the scene. A roving guard . subsequently shot and killed the civilian, who gained access to the world's largest naval base with the proper credentials. According to USA Today, the shooter had a Transportation Worker Identification . Credential, which allows maritime workers unescorted access to secure . areas of port facilities and vessels. The cards are commonly issued to . truck drivers, Navy Military Sealift Command employees, merchant . mariners and workers at a commercial port. The civilian used the card to gain access to Pier 1, which has a separate guard who checks identification. The cards were created after September 11, 2001, in order to strengthen security at commercial ports. However, USA Today reported some members of Congress have criticized the cards because the biometric data stored on them is not scanned when civilians are granted access. It is not clear what prompted the attack and if the civilian worked at the base. He has not been identified. Scene: The Navy is investigating how a civilian gained access to Naval Station Norfolk (pictured) on Monday . The Norfolk base was briefly on lockdown after the Monday night shooting but all areas aside from USS Mahan resumed operations on Tuesday. Blair said she would bury her son at Arlington National Cemetery, a U.S. military cemetery in Virginia. Naval Station Norfolk covers more than 6,000 acres and is the home port for 64 ships, according to information the Navy provided in February.

"By . Louise Boyle . This is the horrifying image of a grimy shack which a young girl was forced to build before being held in it as a sex slave for 15 years. The woman, who has not been identified, was repeatedly raped and brutally controlled from the age of 12 by a male relative who kept her imprisoned in the plywood shed with a single mattress at a home in Richmond, California. Raul Ochoa, 52, was convicted on Wednesday after pleading guilty to one count of forced lewd acts on a child and two counts of forcible rape. As part of a plea deal, he will be formally sentenced to 22 years in state prison next month. Scroll down for video . A woman, who was held captive from the age of 12 until 27, was forced to help build this prison shed where she was held by her captor and sexually abused . The plea deal was organized in part to save the victim the ordeal of having to testify. Ochoa repeatedly raped the girl in the shed, as many as two to three times every week, stopped her from leaving the house and checked her cellphone. She endured years of psychological and emotional abuse after she came to live at the home as a child. During her  ordeal, Ochoa reportedly made the girl work for his landscaping business and home-schooled her. Raul Ochoa, 52, of Richmond, California was convicted of holding a young female relative as a sex slave at his home for 15 years . On one occasion when the girl was asked to dance at a family party by a boy, Ochoa dragged her home, forced her to strip in front of the family and burned her dress. Contra Costa deputy district attorney Ryan Wagner said: 'Basically, her entire childhood was more or less stolen from her. 'He convinced her it [the shack] was going to be a place to watch movies together and a place for the family to hang out, but it turned into something much worse.' The woman was held from 1998 until she escaped in August 2012 after being convinced to flee by her siblings. On August 16 two years ago, she told her captor . that she was going to the restroom and ran from the home. She was taken to . Richmond police station by a waiting car. Police were initially confused because the 27-year-old woman described herself as a runaway and wanted to go to another city. After asking more questions, the officer quickly realized that the young woman, who was acting younger than her years, had suffered a horrifying catalog of abuse and mental torture. Mitch Peixoto, the police officer who first interviewed the girl, remembered that she told him the story about her party dress. He told mercurynews.com on Thursday: 'She didn't know that that was wrong. She spoke very matter-of-factly.' Ochoa was arrested a short time later. The shack has now been razed in the backyard of the California home where a woman was held as a sex slave for 15 years . Scene: The horrifying incident took place in Richmond, California, between 1998 and 2012 . 'What this guy did to her for that long of a period of time was as horrific as I've seen,' DA Wagner told the San Jose Mercury News. 'She's an extremely courageous and strong woman. She was . basically under emotional, physical and psychological abuse her entire . childhood.' 'She felt she couldn't leave, and he would threaten that he would harm her or harm himself if she left,' the prosecutor added. The district attorney said both the girl and Ochoa's . wife suffered 'significant violence' at his hands. It's not known if . his wife and other children in the house knew the extent of the abuse. 'The wife was scared to death of him,' prosecutor Wagner said. The . Mercury News reported that Ochoa asked his wife if he could have sex . with the girl years before the abuse started. When she refused, he . apparently said that he was 'just joking'. The shack where the sexual abuse took place has since been torn down.

"By . Alex Greig . Reading literature may result in greater creativity and less rigid thinking, according to new study by University of Toronto scholars and lead researcher professor Maja Djikic. Djikic reports that people who have just read a short story have less need for 'cognitive closure' and more comfort with disorder and uncertainty. In psychology, the term 'cognitive closure' describes the human desire to eliminate ambiguity and arrive at definite conclusions - sometimes irrationally - which can result in bad decision-making and snap judgements. Well-read: According to the study, people who read regularly are more open-minded than those who don't . The study notes that the need for cognitive closure results in '""seizing"" on an early statement in the process of acquiring knowledge, ""freezing"" on the seized idea, and remaining impervious to additional information' which impedes rationality as well as creativity. For the study, 100 participants were divided into two groups. One group was given an essay to read from among eight choices by respected writers such as George Bernard Shaw. The second group was given a short story to read, by equally illustrious writers of fiction. After reading their essay or short story, participants filled out a survey measuring their need for certainty and stability. They expressed their agreement or disagreement with such statements as 'I donâ€™t like situations that are uncertain' and 'I dislike questions that can be answered in many different ways.' Snap decisions: After reading a short story, respondents to the study indicated they were more comfortable with ambiguous situations that participants who read a factual essay . The study found that those who had read a short story had much lower scores than those who had read an essay - meaning they had less need for stability and certainty. This result was particularly emphasized in study participants who were also regular readers of both fiction and non-fiction. 'The thinking a person engages in while reading fiction does not necessarily lead him or her to a decision,' reports the study, suggesting that readers become more comfortable with ambiguity than non-readers. Thinker: Marilyn Monroe is known for her beauty but a lesser known fact is she was a voracious reader. Titles on her shelf at the time of her death include Flaubert's Madame Bovary, The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway, and On the Road by Jack Kerouac . 'Furthermore, while reading, the reader can simulate the thinking styles even of people he or she might personally dislike. One can think along and even feel along with Humbert Humbert in Lolita, no matter how offensive one finds this character. This double release - of thinking through events without concerns for urgency and permanence, and thinking in ways that are different than oneâ€™s own - may produce effects of opening the mind,' the study continues. The researchers suggest that reading then, is a way of becoming more open-minded. 'Exposure to literature may offer a [way for people] to become more likely to open their minds.' It's not clear exactly how long the more open-minded thinking could last after reading a work of fiction, but the researchers think it's clear the effect is stronger in long-term readers, meaning it's likely their brains become programmed to think in a more creative way and be less likely to need cognitive closure. Speedy: John F Kennedy was purportedly a speed reader, and encouraged his staff to practice the technique . The study urges that people consider the research when educational cutbacks are being made to the arts and humanities, since the reading of fiction appears to be able to shape thinking in a way that other study can't. Reading fiction, the researchers say, 'requires people to become insightful about others and their perspectives,', a sentiment echoed by Confucius: . 'No matter how busy you may think you are, you must find time for reading, or surrender yourself to self-chosen ignorance.' And, in the words perhaps the world's best-known fantasy writer, George R. R. Martin, author of the best-selling, mania-inducing series Game of Thrones, put in the mouth of his character Jojen Reed, 'A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.'","Research from the University of Toronto found that people who had just read a short story were able to think less rigidly and were more comfortable with disorder and uncertainty .
People who are regular readers also appeared to be more creative thinkers and less prone to snap judgements .

A magician who sold two leftover Brussels sprouts from his Christmas dinner on eBay raised £100 for charity. Dan Allam, 21, decided to put the sprouts on the auction site after finishing the rest of his meal on Christmas Day, to prove his claim in a family debate that you could find a buyer for 'anything' on it. But he was stunned when, after uploading a photo of the sprouts, he began receiving dozens of messages from prospective buyers. The organic sprouts, handpicked from Dan’s garden in Ledbury, Herefordshire, on Christmas Eve, have been kept fresh in iced water. Some 22 bidders pledged cash for the sprouts and more than 850 eBay sellers keeping tabs on the auction. The winning bid was £99.99 and will be donated to the Make A Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to children and young people fighting life-threatening conditions. Mr Allam said he came up with the idea at Christmas lunch with his parents Nigel, 47, Michele, 44, sister Tori, 22 and grandfather John Allam, 89. He said: ‘It is my grandfather’s tradition to wait until after lunch before opening the presents and we always discuss what we think we have during the meal. ‘My sister admitted she had sold a hideous jumper she had received on eBay and I said, ""Well, you can sell anything on there these days."" ‘Then I looked down at my plate and there were these two unwanted sprouts left. I got my phone out and took a picture of them, before uploading it to eBay. ‘Within an hour I had received 15 emails and then it just escalated. I thought I would only raise £1 but the bids are now at £100. It is great for the charity.’ Bonanza: After Mr Allam uploaded a photo of the sprouts on eBay, some 22 bidders pledged cash and more than 800 others kept tabs on the auction . Mr Allam has received poems and messages of support as well as questions about how the sprouts will taste and whether they are suitable for vegetarians. He has even measured the sprouts after questioning from eBay users. The larger has a diameter of 2.27cm while the smaller has one of 1.92cm. Dan, who has the username majik_dan on eBay, added: ‘It is one of the most bizarre things I have ever done.’","Dan Allam put the sprouts on the auction site to prove you could find a buyer for 'anything'

"By . James Rush . President Barack Obama reached back 100 years to reinforce the U.S. and European bond as he called for a commitment to peace during a solemn pilgrimage to a World War I cemetery. Obama joined Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo and King Phillipe in laying a wreath at Flanders Field, in Belgium, to pay tribute to American troops who died a century ago in the struggle to save Europe in the First World War. 'This visit, this hallowed ground, reminds us that we must never ever take our progress for granted,' Obama said at the cemetery and memorial. 'We must commit perennially to peace, which binds us across oceans.' Scroll down for video . U.S. President Barack Obama, Belgium's King Philippe (second right) and Belgium's Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo (right) visit the Flanders Field American World War I Cemetery and Memorial in Waregem . President Obama reinforced the bond between the U.S. and Europe in a speech during the visit to the cemetery . Five helicopters, escorting President Obama, arrive in Wevelgem for a one-day visit to Belgium . The three leaders then walked among some of the white crosses that mark the burial site of 368 American troops, most of whom gave their lives in liberating Belgium from German occupation. The Belgian leaders did not mention Russian President Vladimir Putin by name in remarks afterward, but clearly referenced his annexation of Crimea as they recalled the lessons of world war. 'Our countries have learned the hard way that national sovereignty quickly reaches its limits' when confronted with armed adversaries, who don't respect that sovereignty, said King Phillipe. 'We have to continue to draw lessons from the terrible war that started 100 years ago,' Di Rupo said. 'And, above all, we have to prevent new conflicts. Those who ignore the past are taking the risk to relive it.' Obama is visiting Brussels on a one-day trip to shore up commitments he received from allies in The Hague, Netherlands, to reassure Eastern European members of NATO that the alliance will stand by them and to make a larger point about European security a quarter-century after the fall of the Iron Curtain. He held a working lunch with European Union officials and later was to meet with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, embracing the alliance born as a bulwark against the Soviet Union. The president described Russia a day earlier as a 'regional power' that was threatening its neighbours 'not out of strength, but out of weakness'. He said that as president, he worried more about a nuclear device in Manhattan than he did about Russia.

It has been suggested the language was likely to antagonize Putin, but it also belied the time and energy Obama and European leaders have devoted to isolate Russia and fashion a menu of sanctions designed to stop Moscow's aggression. Obama planned to conclude his day with his only speech of the weeklong, four-country trip, tying the current Ukraine crisis to his vision of the United States and Europe as anchors of democracy and international law. Obama's stewardship of U.S.-European relations has been hurt by revelations of communications prying by the U.S. National Security Agency. At the same time, the U.S. has been working with European trade officials on an ambitious trans-Atlantic trade partnership.

'To you from failing hands we throw the torch, be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die, we shall not sleep, though poppies grow in Flanders Fields,' Obama read.

Scroll down for video . Apa Sherpa has made it to the summit of Everest a record 21 times has hung up his trekking boots, and has revealed that he has always hated climbing . He holds an invincible record and led the first-ever expedition across the 1,700km Great Himalayan Trail last year . Sixty years after Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay first summited Sagarmatha, the 51-year-old 'Super Sherpa' was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Utah for his dedication to the mountain . Having waved goodbye to Nepal and settled in the US Apa, known in the . climbing world as the Michael Jordan of mountaineering, is now a cleaner . at a plastic factory. He said he had stepped aside for a new generation of mountaineers. Apa said: 'I am making way for younger ones, and to support and look after my family. I want my children to have a good education. 'I would like one of them to become a doctor - that would be great if one of them could live up to my goal. 'It is an incredible honour to be awarded this and I am delighted to be recognised. I'm proud to have climbed the mountain the most times - some people can't even make it up once. 'The mountain blessed me and looks after me.' In an interview with Las Vegas-based filmmaker Tami Bradshaw, who is exploring his remarkable life in 'Tiger of the Himalayas', the Super Sherpa admitted that American life takes quite some getting used to, but it's time to move on from climbing. Apa said: 'I moved to the US to put my kids through school - it's totally different here. At home in Nepal we used to trek three hours to get food and three hours back, but here there's groceries right next to your house. We're spoilt being here. 'It wasn't easy to adjust here - like driving. We have to drive and can't walk anywhere. We didn't really understand the rules but now it's okay and it was a very good choice to move here.' Apa Sherpa on the mountain. He said he has stepped aside for a new generation of mountaineers . Apa Sherpa as a child. Having waved goodbye to Nepal and settled in the US Apa, known in the climbing world as the Michael Jordan of mountaineering, is now a cleaner at a plastic factory . Posing with his family, from left Tenzing, Yangjin, Apa, Pemba, Dawa. He said he has moved to the US to give his children greater opportunity . One of the many ladders used by those trying to summit the mountain to cross crevasses . Apa's overwhelming life achievements began when he escaped death from an avalanche that flung him from his mother's arms down a Himalayan ice ledge at just two months old. His faints cries were heard by his mother and he made a miraculous recovery - he has had a special connection with the mountain range ever since but never intended to climb Everest's 8,848 metres. Since then he has become the only man in history to reach the top of the world 21 times. Ironically, summiting Everest was never a goal for Apa. At 12 years old he began working as an expedition porter to earn money following the death of his father. Trekkers immediately noticed the child who, despite his exceedingly small stature, carried loads greater than his own weight with strength, quickness and a wide smile. Apa said: 'When I was young I wanted to become a doctor. But I needed to support my family so I had to have a living and I quit school and became a porter.'The job of a Sherpa for both men and women is very risky because we never know if we'll live - but they have no choice they have to make money to live and for their families and kids' education. 'I got paid very little money at the time - it's not easy to carry more than your body weight and very heavy loads and walk every day - it's not fun. 'A lot of Sherpa's are killed on the mountain, some of my friends died every year on the mountains. It's extremely dangerous and we risk our lives.' Coming from Thame, the hometown of Everest legend Tenzing Norgay, it was almost inevitable that Apa would become a high altitude Sherpa guide on Everest. He began carrying loads on Everest in 1988, but it wasn't until May 10, 1990, that he reached the summit for the first time along with Rob Hall, Gary Ball, and Peter Hillary. Since that memorable day, Apa has participated in 22 Everest expeditions and reached the summit 21 times. At 12 years old he began working as an expedition porter to earn money following the death of his father. Since then he has climbed the mountain 21 times . Adhering to a simple philosophy that 'Everest will always be there' and it is more important to keep all team members and Sherpas safe, Apa has led his teams to amazing success. Apa said: 'Everybody talks about Everest and Sir Edmund and Tenzing Norgay so I thought okay well maybe one day I could reach it at least once - I never had any intention of doing it so many times. 'When Rob and I climbed it it was the first time for us both, we eventually climbed it three times together and he was one of my best friends.' However, despite persistent persuasion, Rob failed to coerce Apa into joining his 1996 mission after his wife Yangjin ordered him to stay put and help build the family home. The excursion hit the headlines around the world for catastrophic reasons, Rob and seven others were killed just 24 hours into their journey. It has become known as the worst climbing disaster in the mountain's history. Apa said: 'I was supposed to go in 1996 with Rob but my wife said I couldn't go because I needed to help build our house. 'My wife saved my life, if I'd have gone something could have happened to me - you'd never know if I'd have survived.' Adhering to a simple philosophy that 'Everest will always be there' and it is more important to keep all team members and Sherpas safe, Apa has led his teams to amazing success . Last year he became the first person to successfully lead an expedition across the 1,700km-long Great Himalayan Trail that spans the entire mountain range - Apa's team reached their destination 20 days ahead of schedule. Apa was a good friend of Sir Edmund and led an expedition to carry his ashes to the top of Everest more than 50 years after he became the first person to reach the summit on May 29 1953. But the Nepalese government forbid the ceremony and instead Apa climbed with a statue to pray for him at the top. After hanging up his boots, he set up the Apa Sherpa Foundation to continue Sir Edmund's pioneering work helping Nepal's development and improving the lives of thousands of Sherpas and villagers. Apa said: 'I met Sir Edmund many times and it was always very special, he used to come every year to Nepal and even our school was built by him - he helped the country a lot. He introduced schools, monasteries, clinics and health care.'","Apa Sherpa holds an invincible record but has hung up his trekking boots .

Michael Parker, 45, has denied murdering the dog - called Cow Cow - despite two security videos showing him release her from the trunk of his vehicle, then accelerate directly towards her before driving off and leaving her for dead. The incident occurred in an alley in Hawthorne, California, on December 28. Scroll down for video . Security camera footage captured Cow Cow's final moments before he was cruelly run over by Parker's vehicle . Parker's estranged wife Olga said she feared for the safety of her three children after seeing what her husband had done to Cow Cow . Cow Cow’s body wasn’t found until several days later when a nearby resident discovered her. The resident then contacted Hawthorne Police who used the surveillance video to track down and arrest Parker in January. He was charged on Tuesday with felony counts of animal cruelty and animal neglect and a misdemeanor charge of petty theft of a dog. Parker’s estranged wife Olga told KTLA in January that she believed Cow Cow, who was five and half, was killed in retaliation for her having not given Parker money from their retirement fund. 'If someone would do that to a dog… what would he do to my kids,' she said. The couple have two sons and a daughter. Parker allegedly took another of the family dogs - Lucky - but he escaped and survived. Parker faces over five years in state prison if convicted on all counts. He was ordered to return to the Airport Branch of the Los Angeles Superior Court on April 25. In the disturbing surveillance video, Parker is seen driving his four-door sedan into the alley, getting out of his vehicle, opening and closing the trunk and then climbing back into the car. Seconds later, Cow Cow scurries out from behind the vehicle and darts in front of it. In this footage Cow Cow can be seen trying to get out of the way of the vehicle that is speeding towards him . Tragic end: After running over Cow Cow, Parker's vehicle can be seen speeding off . Parker then backs up and directs his vehicle straight at the defenseless dog. 'It's shocking. You never expect to see a little animal like that run over and left there to die without the driver even looking back. It wasn't an accident. He purposefully did it,' said Hawthorne Police Lt. Scott Swain. Parker has admitted to police that he was in the alley, but claims he didn't mean to harm the family pet. The horrific cruelty has drawn much interest from animal lovers and one online petition has garnered nearly 3,000 signatures in support of Parker’s prosecution. 'He aimed right at the helpless little dog, who was looking up at his ""devoted owner,"" ran over the little guy and then zoomed off without a second thought,' the petition reads.

On March 16, three juveniles set a fire inside the home that they couldn't extinguish, police say. Their names and those of the other juveniles arrested have not been released.

"By . Ashley Collman . Not so lucky: Maria Martin, 48, is currently serving a 33-month federal prison sentence for stealing more than $800,000 and losing it all on casino slot games . An Oklahoma mother was caught stealing more than $800,000 from ATM machines, and authorities say she lost it all gambling at local casinos. Authorities caught 48-year-old Lawton mother Maria Martin when the gas station ATMs she was supposed to be filling kept turning up empty. Martin's job was to refill the ATMs with funds from Arvest Bank and Fort Sill Credit Union, but instead she started keeping the money in 2011 to spend at the casinos. Prosecutors say she visited local casinos like Comanche Nation at least once a week, and would spend up to $70,000 in stolen money on the slots. On one occasion she made ten visits to a casino in a single day. In January, the former Girl Scout troop leader was sentenced to 33 months in federal prison. 'It's just outrageous,' US Attorney Sanford Coates told KFOR. 'Obviously, you have the banks and financial institutions whose money was taken, and over $800,000 in course of the scheme, but the other layer of victim is the company that she worked for. This was a company that was a small business, very successful, had been around for many years, decades. They lost a lot of trust from their clients, and lost a lot of business,' Coats added. But Martin's attorney says her crimes are only a product of a sad addiction to gambling. 'She had no prior criminal history. She was a home run mother, an outstanding law abiding citizen, and I think thatâ€™s what the tragedy is int his case. It just points out what can happen when somebody develops a gambling problem,' Herring said. Martin is currently in Texas federal prison and will be for the next 30 months. Once she gets out, Martin will be on probation for five years and will have to pay back the money she stole from the banks. Scroll down for video .

"By . Martin Robinson . Tragedy: Daisy Holmes, 16, sent a Facebook message to her on-off boyfriend hours before she was found hanged . A teenager described as a 'victim from birth' died hours after sending a message to her boyfriend telling him: 'this will be the last time I bother you', an inquest has heard. Daisy Holmes, 16, sent the Facebook note on November 16 last year, hours before she was  found hanged at her flat in Hull, East Yorkshire. The city's coroner's court heard the teenager had a history of self-harming and had tried to kill herself the previous year. Her adoptive family say her problems began when her biological father met up with her but called her the wrong name. Daisy's adopted parents, Carol and Ann Holmes, now want more work to be done to help young people suffering with depression and suicidal thoughts. Speaking after the hearing, Carol said: 'We want children to be able to talk to each other about their thoughts and feelings and get them out in the open. 'Suicide is a very taboo subject and we want there to be more awareness.' Daisy was adopted by the Hull couple when she was ten after suffering years of abuse and neglect. She kept in touch with her birth parents but when her father turned up to see her drunk and called her the wrong name - something her boyfriend Jamie West said had caused her to self-harm. At the time of her death, Daisy was living at the Kingston Project after relations with her adopted parents had broken down. Her social worker Angela Smerdon told the inquest in Hull the teenager had been upset because Jamie had been seeing another girl. Mrs Smerdon said: 'Daisy said she was angry with Jamie and felt let down by everyone. 'I told her she deserved a good life and should try to concentrate on positive things. 'I didn't think she intended on taking her own life.' Troubled: Daisy's adoptive parents said she was a 'victim from birth' and had struggled when her father met her but called her the wrong name . Health visitor Michael Falk also met Daisy five days before her death when she told him she had suicidal thoughts once every other week. Mr Falk arranged a further meeting with Daisy the following week. Final message: The teenager messaged her partner to say: 'This . will be the last time I bother you' and was found hanged at home . On the evening of her death, Daisy had returned to her flat after a trip into the city centre to meet Jamie. He said: 'We met at the bus station and that was the last time I saw her. 'She seemed fine, she was happy we were back together - there was nothing to suggest she would take her own life.' Starting his shift at 9pm that evening, friend Luke Baldwin went to check on the teen and found her dead. Her adoptive mother said in a statement Daisy had been a 'victim since birth, who had a challenging relationship with her boyfriend, tensions with us, difficulties relating to professionals and disappointment over her career plans'. The parents added: 'Daisy was proud to be an Army cadet and dreamed of becoming a medic in the Army. 'She was renowned for her sense of humour and ability to make people smile. 'We are proud that Daisy touched the lives of so many people she came into contact with; people who have shared with us the endearing impression she has left. 'We have been overwhelmed and greatly comforted by the love and support from all.' The inquest into Daisy's death resumed today when assistant coroner Rosemary Baxter is expected to return her verdict.

"By . Lydia Warren . Perhaps she was unimpressed by the scale of the Great Wall of China, or maybe the ancient Terracotta Army fell short of her liking. Either way, 12-year-old Sasha Obama looked bored as she toured China's most beautiful sites with her mother Michelle, sister Malia, 15, and grandmother, Marian Robinson. The group are in China on a whirlwind good-will tour - but photographs have revealed that Sasha looks like she'd much rather be back home with her friends. The president's daughter was also still nursing an apparently broken thumb in a white cast. Not having fun? Sasha Obama rests her chin on her hand as she and her mother Michelle watch a performance on the top of an ancient city wall in Xi'an during their week-long trip to China . On Monday, they toured the ancient city of Xi'an but once they got to the City Wall, Sasha looked unimpressed with the 600-year-old relic. She leaned against it and rested her chin on her hand. The family also visited the Terracotta . Army - 8,000 terra-cotta warriors that were buried along with China's . first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, around 210 BC as a way to protect him. And when the first lady was greeted by a group of schoolchildren and jumped rope with them - much to the delight of her Chinese hosts - her daughters hung back and watched. A day earlier, Sasha donned sunglasses for a walk on the Great Wall near Beijing, but while her big sister skipped and jumped in excitement ahead of her, she trailed behind.

"By . Ruth Styles . From pork scratchings to haggis, brussels sprouts and marmite, most of us are fans of at least one food that others wouldn't touch. But while marmite might seem a bizarre choice to some, the yeasty spread pales in comparison to the favourite snack of Brittoni, from Toledo in Ohio. Instead of putting make-up on her face, the 22-year-old prefers to eat it, munching her way through between 15 and 20 compacts a day. Tasty: Make-up fan Brittoni savours some of her favourite metallic brown and grey eyeshadow . What's more, she says, the taste varies by brand and colour, with metallic eyeshadow in light brown, white and grey apparently boasting the nicest flavour. 'I cannot live without eating make-up,' she explains. 'You can imagine it just coating your insides with whatever colour you're eating. It's just like craving your favourite candy bar.' Brittoni's unusual habit began when she was just five years old and, intrigued by the colours in her mother's make-up case, decided to taste it. 'Seeing all the colours made me want to . taste it,' she remembers. 'Once I tasted it, I just could not stop eating make-up. 'My favourite type of eyeshadow to eat is . usually the metallic colours,' she continues. 'My favourite colours are grey, white and . the light colour browns. Light colours usually taste a lot cleaner than . darker colours.' Tucking in: Brittoni has eaten make-up since tasting a compact belonging to her mother at the age of five . Dangerous: Brittoni's unusual snack contains some unpleasant ingredients such as talc, mica and mineral oil . Tasty treat: This Bobbi Brown Palette with several metallic shades would be a treat for Brittoni . Despite having had a penchant for tucking into eyeshadow since the age of five, Brittoni admits that she goes to extreme lengths to keep her snacking habits secret from her family. 'I hide make-up everywhere around my . house,' she explains. 'Under the couches, in the flower vases, the freezer... My hair is . long so I like to use it to conceal the make-up I would like to bring. 'I . keep my addiction to make-up hidden because I'd rather not go through . the hassle of explaining it to people. 'My mother doesn't know but if she . knew, I'd never hear the end of it and it would go on for hours and . hours every day.' Thanks to her penchant for eating make-up, Brittoni now spends upwards of $200 (£120) a week on cosmetics and has developed an unusual supermarket shopping routine. 'When I come into the store, I have to . taste to make sure I bought the right ones,' she reveals. 'I would just pour some on my . hand, look around to make sure no-one's walking down the aisle and I . would just lick it. 'If it's not the right kind and since nobody sees me . lick it, I'll put it back. I know that's kind of wrong but I don't want . to get stuck with something I don't eat or wear.' But while Brittoni appears to think that her penchant for eating make-up is harmless, a swift glance at some common ingredients is enough to suggest that it's likely to be doing her body no good at all. Among ingredients typically found in Brittoni's favourite eyeshadow is Talc, or as it's properly known, hydrous magnesium silicate which is similar to asbestos. Choices: Brittoni stocks up on make-up at the local supermarket - she spends up to £120 a week . Sneaky: Brittoni takes a sneaky slurp from a compact while shopping for make-up in a supermarket . Other substances found in make-up include mineral oil, a petrol derivative, and mica, a mineral that is used to colour paint. Diagnosed with heart trouble at the age of 12, possibly because of her unusual habit, Brittoni says she tries not to think about potential adverse effects. 'I try not to think about the impact the . make-up is having on my heart,' she explains. 'I see the chemicals in the make-up and I . don't know what they are. 'It really scares me: are they making my heart . worse? Are they not affecting me at all? I don't know.' And its not just her health that has been affected. Brittoni's relationship with boyfriend Josh has also been put under strain by her passion for paint. 'One day I saw her doing it and she tasted it, then I just saw her eat a whole scoop of the thing and I couldn't believe it,' he explains. 'When she eats make-up, it looks like a clown went crazy. You know how you have a milk mustache? It looks like that to the tenth power - that's how her face looks. I've kissed her before and I've tasted make-up - it's horrible.'

"By . Simon Cable . It has been imparting words of wisdom and advice to young girls for almost two decades. But the editor of Britain’s longest-running pre-teen magazine has now insisted that controversial pop stars including Miley Cyrus will no longer feature in Girl Talk magazine, following concerns over their increasingly sexualised behaviour. Despite being a regular cover star of the publication, which launched in 1995, the 21-year-old singer is now considered to be a poor role model for the 7-12 age group that the magazine caters for. Scroll down for video . The editor of Britain's longest-running pre-teen magazine has now insisted that controversial pop stars including Miley Cyrus will no longer feature in Girl Talk magazine, following concerns over their increasingly sexualised behaviour . Instead, the publication’s bosses have launched a new campaign which will see them featuring less celebrities and more varied female role models, claiming they have a responsibility to ‘protect the development’ of young women. Miley Cyrus first appeared on the cover of Girl Talk as 17-year-old Disney Starlet Hannah Montana. But Bea Appleby, editor of the magazine, has now revealed that the new campaign, which has been called Girls Are Amazing, will feature more responsible role models such as Taylor Swift and Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton. The move came in response to a readership survey carried out by Girl Talk, which revealed that eight of the top ten most-admired celebrities were all singers. Top of the list was controversial star Katy Perry, followed by Taylor Swift and Jessie J. The study also found that the majority of readers aspired to be a singer, dancer or actor, while a quarter of readers said that the most important way for them to be described was ‘pretty’. Miley Cyrus first appeared on the cover of Girl Talk as 17-year-old Disney Starlet Hannah Montana . Miss Appleby told the Daily Mail yesterday: ‘We have always been very careful about having stars in our magazine who are suitable - not too raunchy or controversial. ‘We haven’t had Miley Cyrus in the magazine for a long time because she is now too raunchy for us. When she was Hannah Montana we used to have her on the cover all the time. She was great for us, but she has changed and she has become much more sexualised. ‘It is a bit hard for us to reconcile what her videos are like and that we are dealing with eight year old girls. It’s hard for us to promote her and she is not suitable for this age group. ‘It is difficult to find pop stars that are suitable. Even the most innocent kinds of pop stars are still a bit sexy.’ Miss Appleby suggested that US country singer Taylor Swift was an example of a pop star who appealed to the pre-teenage readership, but who was not considered overtly sexualised. However, she added that the fortnightly magazine, which publishes its 500th issue today, would endeavour to feature a wider range of female celebrities in its pages, including sports stars and successful businesswomen. She added: ‘Our readers like pop stars, but we need to make sure that we balance it out and feature people who aren’t dancing around in a sexy way wearing nearly nothing. Miss Appleby suggested that US country singer Taylor Swift was an example of a pop star who appealed to the pre-teenage readership, but who was not considered overtly sexualised . ‘The ten most admired celebrities were all singers or actors. Sportswomen, politicians and businesswomen didn’t register on the list. ‘We need to show there are lots of other interesting women out there doing interesting things, who aren’t trading on their looks and who are valued for something other than how they look. ‘We uphold certain standards where we don’t talk about anything to do with sex. We don’t talk about boys. We are very much about female friendship.’ Speaking about the magazine, Miss Appleby said delivering content for pre-teenage girls came with a lot of responsibility in preparing them for their teenage years. ‘We have always tried to protect the development of young girls, making sure that they don’t grow up too early, but our survey results have revealed that this is not enough. ‘We have a duty to show our readers different ways of being a girl and not just one narrow ideal. We want to encourage them to achieve and break away from limiting and old-fashioned beliefs about what girls can do. The magazine editor said it will have features on sports stars, and businesswomen, and if it works we will have stars like Jessica Ennis on the cover . ‘Within the magazine we will have a much broader range. We will have features on sports stars, and businesswomen, and if it works we will have stars like Jessica Ennis on the cover.’ ‘If early on we can give them a sense that there are lots of things that women can do that are worthwhile other than being pretty and attractive, then hopefully that will stick with them as they get older. ‘We can give them a foundation so that when they get to their teenage years they have already started thinking about how they can be a chemical engineer. ‘I spend a lot of time taking to ten year old girls and they are very switched on. They already know about inequality between men and women and understand about the pressures that girls are under. They are bombarded constantly with images of airbrushed women. It is a very unattainable idea of beauty that we all see. They are just the same as women in what they are being fed. ‘We realised that we really have to do something to help with this. We are part of why they think that and we want to break that cycle and show them different people to look up to and show them different careers that they can aspire to.’","Miley Cyrus won't feature in Girl Talk magazine, after sexualised behaviour .

He also says Weir is holding their dog Tema . hostage. In legal . documents obtained by TMZ, Voronov also alleges that Weir forced him out . of the closet during their relationship and that he married him because . his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would make compelling . reality television. Claiming that his husband treated him like an errand boy, Voronov says that Weir was cruel to him and even forbid him from letting his dog, Tema, live with them in case it took his attention away from the ice-skater. In addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims the Olympian took from him. These include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags. He is also claiming temporary support and legal fees. Happier times: Weir had been married to Victor Voronov, pictured together in 2012, for two years before their increasingly acrimonious split . Anger: The two have traded accusations about the other through the media - alleging adultery and physical abuse . A source close to Weir told TMZ that the property Voronov is requesting was the Winter Olympic commentators before their marriage, which the source added, 'couldn't be more obvious from the fact that they are purses and women's furs.' The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations. But  last week, in a sign of how acrimonious the split has becoming, Weir pened up about his divorce from his husband - claiming his husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money. In an ugly twist, the 29-year-old former skater shared details of his two-year marriage with Victor Voronov, a non-practicing attorney, in an interview with Access Hollywood on Thursday. While he was all smiles and professionalism during his stint as a commentator in Sochi, behind the scenes, he struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner, he said. He filed for divorce on February 12, while he was in Sochi. And in a sign that this split may be about to get uglier still, Weir's ex released an image to TMZ of the bite mark he claimed the presenter inflicted on his arm. 'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in. 'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.' Violent: Voronov released a picture of a bite mark he sustained after a fight with Weir just before Sochi . Return: This is Tema - Victor Voronov's dog - who is not being returned to him by Johnny Weir according to court papers seen by TMZ . Happier times: Victor Voronov and Johnny Weir on their wedding day in 2011 and (right) out and about in Manhattan . He said that while the damage couldn't be seen on his body, he was controlled emotionally and Voronov forced him to cut out friends, professional contacts and even his mother. He added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police. A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm.  Despite the fall out, however, the couple appeared together in a New Jersey court earlier this month and a judge agreed to dismiss the case. Speaking to Access Hollywood, Weir said that physical attacks weren't just made by him. 'Some of my closest friends have seen him hit me before,' he said. He added that he had added pressure because Voronov, whom he married after a short romance, had taken on the 'traditional' role and Weir was left to provide for the two of them. 'He was not super accepting of the fact that I work and I have to work this week in Russia, this week in Los Angeles, next week in Tokyo,' he said. 'I was supporting two people and whether it seems like a big deal or not, I come from a lower middle class family that has to work, no matter what. 'If you can’t be an attorney this week, then you better go get a job next week, otherwise the bills won’t get paid. I had to travel to work to support myself and to support my family.' On Friday, TMZ also reported that Weir emailed Voronov last September, claiming that he had destroyed his pricey Birkin bag. 'If you decide to wreck things, please wreck cheaper things than Birkin,' he wrote. 'He goes on ...""The f*** you on the Birkin is kinda cool, though, you artist.' Despite the rocky relationship, Voronov said on his Twitter account that he had not been aware that Weir had filed for divorce until the announcement this week. Weir had written on Wednesday: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.' 'Shocked by the abrupt ending of my marriage and am dealing with the trauma including multiple things I am just now becoming aware of...' he wrote on Wednesday. Champion on ice: Weir competed in the 2010 . Vancouver Winter Olympics, finishing sixth place in the men's single . competition, and was a hit in his first commentary stint at Sochi . On Thursday he added: 'Yes. I'd like to confirm, It's true: I am only now finding out that my husband @johnnygweir filed for divorce from me months ago.' Voronov's spokesperson, Wendy Feldman, added: 'It is our extreme hope and desire that this divorce could have been handled amicably. Not only is Victor heartbroken but he is now humiliated.' But Weir said he's not worried about the scandal - and that his ex has nothing up his sleeve that could do any damage. 'The worst that he could do is post naked photos that we have between each other and I look flawless,' he said. Weir officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov, a Georgetown Law graduate. Ahead of the nuptials, Weir told IceNetwork that Voronov, who comes from a Russian family but grew up in Atlanta, was 'kind of everything that I've ever looked for and aspired to be in a relationship with'. He went on: 'We've known for a long time and we reconnected over the summer, and it's just been a whirlwind. He's wonderful. He's in the legal field, completely separate from all of my razzle dazzle. He loves watching me perform and seeing what I actually do.' But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'","Weir's husband Victor Voronov filed court papers alleging he violated a restraining order by sending him the email .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Appeal: Lawyers for Manfo Asiedu, 40, who was jailed for 33 years in 2007 for his part in the failed 2005 London bombings, are to appeal . Lawyers for one of the 21/7 bombers will appear before the Court of Appeal saying his conviction should be quashed because evidence used in the 2007 trial was unsound. Manfo Asiedu, 40, who was arrested after the failed London bombings in 2005, was jailed for 33 years in 2007 after admitting conspiracy to cause explosions. He pleaded guilty after jurors in the original trial - at which four men were found guilty of conspiracy to murder - were unable to reach a verdict on the part he played. Tomorrow, Asiedu's legal team will argue that an expert witness used in the original trial used 'flawed' evidence. On the day of the bombing, 21 July 2005, four devices on trains and a bus around London failed to detonate, instead fizzing and popping.  The defendants at the subsequent trial argued that they never intended them to go off, and were merely intended to be fake suicide attempts as a protest against the Iraq invasion. Forensic expert Stuart Black had testified about the mix of chemicals the would-be bombers carried in their rucksacks.  A prosecution witness, he testified that the devices were real and only failed to explode because the men had not mixed the ingredients, such as hydrogen peroxide and flour, in the right quantities. But Asiedu's lawyers will argue that methods used by Mr Black to obtain his evidence were 'not considered to be of sufficient quality' by a senior forensic expert at the government-run Forensic Explosives Laboratory (FEL), the Guardian reports. Sean Doyle, who went on to become chief scientist of the FEL, and his colleagues prepared a report in 2006 in which they wrote: 'Dr Black appears to have no quality system in place which would allow sufficient confidence to be placed in his findings and the validity of his results and therefore his conclusions'. Asiedu's lawyers will claim that he would never have been convicted if the FEL's doubts about Mr Black's evidence had been put to the jury. They will also put forward evidence that the FEL's doubts about Mr Black's evidence were put to anti-terrorist police officers, although a note about a meeting between FEL and police did note that any concerns were resolved. Four 21/7 bombers were jailed for life, including Muktar Ibrahim, left, and Ramzi Mohammed (shown at arrest) Hussain Osman, left, and Yassin Omar, right, were jailed for life for their part in the failed 21/7 London bombings . Lawyers for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will argue that Mr Black's notes were made available to the defence team at the time of the trial. In 2010 Mr Doyle gave evidence in support of an attempt by Asiedu to have his sentence overturned. Last year, an appeal judge turned down another appeal by Asiedu to have his sentence quashed, saying that at the original trial, the defence team knew about Mr Black's original mistakes and that he had apologised and remedied them, and that his work had been peer-reviewed. Following the 2007 trial, Muktar Ibrahim, then 29, Yassin Omar, then 26, Ramzi Mohammed, then 25, and Hussain Osman, then 28, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder and each sentenced to life imprisonment. When jurors failed to reach a verdict on Asiedu, who was up on the same charge, he faced a retrial but then pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of conspiracy to cause explosions. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Manfo Asiedu, 40, was arrested following the failed 2005 London bombings .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:24 EST, 26 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:12 EST, 26 March 2014 . A new service is helping New Yorkers who are too busy or lazy to get their hands on trendy new products by hiring out people to wait in line for them. Robert Samuel came up with the idea for his business, Same Ol Line Dudes, after selling two spots in line for the iPhone 5 launch and making an impressive $325. These days, he and his team rake in $25 for the first hour they spend in line and $10 for each half-hour after that. 'It's a phenomenon,' he told Racked.com. Good things come to those who wait: Robert Samuel (pictured) founded Same Ol Line Dudes, a company that lets you hire people to stand in line for you and wait for Cronuts, iPhones and other trendy releases . 'I did an interview with German Public Radio a while ago and I explained FOMO: fear of missing out,' said the former AT&T employee. 'Especially . [in] New York, you have friends and you're hanging out and it's like, . ""Did you see that new exhibit at MoMA?"" ""Do you know what a Cronut is?""' Indeed, the Cronut is particularly hard to come by because only 200 are made per day, and there is always a line of at least 40 people outside before the Dominique Ansel bakery even opens its doors. Mr Ansel recently had to crack down on scalpers who were buying Cronuts in bulk - which is against the two Cronut per customer limit - and selling them on Craigslist for up to $40 each. Lucrative business: Mr Samuel (pictured in line for a Cronut at Dominique Ansel) and his team rake in $25 for the first hour they spend in line and $10 for each half-hour after that . Sought-after: The Cronut is particularly hard to come by because only 200 are made per day, and there is always a line of at least 40 people outside before the bakery even opens its doors . But Mr Samuel sticks to the rules. 'I have two or three uber rich clients,' he reveals. 'One wants Cronuts a lot [for] whenever friends come to visit from out of town.' So he gets to the bakery hours ahead of its 8am open time, armed with his usual tools for staying occupied: a portable charger, two iPhones, an iPad mini and hand warmers. For the longer waits, like the launch of Isabel Marant for H&M, he brings a sleeping bag and even a tent. 'It just pops up, and people will look like, ""Oh my God, it's that serious,""' he jokes, adding that a lawn chair, the Metro and HBOGo also come in handy. Tricks of the trade: To stay occupied, he brings a portable charger, two iPhones and an iPad mini (pictured: the line for autographs by NFL stars Jim Brown and Cam Newton) The longest he's ever had to wait in line was a whopping 19 hours for the new iPhone 5. 'That was how the whole idea of line sitting came about,' he reveals. At the time, he had just lost his job at AT&T and was thinking of inventive ways to supplement his income. 'Especially in New York, you have friends and it's like, . ""Did you see that new exhibit at MoMA?"" ""Do you know what a Cronut is?""' 'I live a few blocks from the Apple store on 14th Street, so I said, ""Let me wait in line for somebody else and make them happy,""; he recalls. A man gave him $100 to wait in line before cancelling his request, saying he would buy the phone online instead - but he let him keep the money. So Mr Samuel sold his spot in line for another . $100. Then he collected milk crates from his house and sold them for $5 . each to people who had been in line for hours and wanted a place to sit . down. Real deal: For longer waits, he brings a sleeping bag and a tent. 'People want these things like it¿s the end of the world,' he said (pictured: waiting for the first ever Marni Sample sale in November) All in all, he made $325 that day and realized he may have stumbled upon a lucrative business. Now, he has seven people working for him as professional waiters and 15 more who have expressed their interest. 'People want these things like it’s the end of the world,' he told the New York Post in November. 'When I show up to their offices with a sleeping bag in one hand and the Cronuts in another, they know they're getting their money's worth.'","Robert Samuel and his team at Same Ole Line Dudes will wait for sample sales, Broadway tickets, Nike sneaker releases, Apple product launches, talk shows, early morning audience lines and celebrity meet and greets ."
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Millionaire lingerie boss Michelle Mone has called for inheritance tax to be axed to stop the government spending her money when she dies. The mother-of-three, who owns the £50million Ultimo push up bra firm, said the tax on money and property left to loved ones was ‘unfair and should be abolished’. The plea came after David Cameron hinted the Tory party manifesto at the next election will exempt all estates worth up to £1million. Scroll down for video . Ultimo boss Michelle Mone said inheritance tax was unfair and should be abolished so people can leave their money to their children or charities . Rising house prices mean the number of families paying the 40 per cent levy will double to one in ten over the next five years. Under current rules a single person can leave £325,000 tax-free, while couples have a joint threshold of £650,000. But Mrs Mone, who divorced last year, called for an end to death taxes, insisting she had already paid tax on her earnings in life. ‘I work really hard every single day - like a lot of people - for my children and for my children’s future,’ she told BBC 2’s Newsnight. ‘I want them to have that little nest for their future and for their children, and I don't see why I, others should work extremely hard, pay your tax and then when you die it is like a double whammy. ‘House prices are rising which means that there is a lot more people who have to pay inheritance tax. It is unfair and should be abolished. ‘I certainly don’t want the government deciding what to do with my money when I am dead.’ Mrs Mone said her earings were taxed in lfie and should not be taxed again in death . Last year Mrs Mone wrested control of her business empire from the hands of her former husband Michael after agreeing to buy his share for an estimated £24million. She said she had already written her will, which would see her wealth passed to her children in stages. ‘I am bringing my children up with that hardworking, want to succeed background. My kids don’t suddenly get the case. My kids get it at stages in life, hopefully they went get it until late in life and I will live forever. ‘That’s what I want to do. I want to work hard in order to make my children’s future a bit easier in order that they have got that nest, that they are protected. ‘I have three children. I am a single parent and I don’t want my kids struggling. I also don’t want them to be spoilt. ‘I think I should decide what I do with my money.  I have already got my will there for my children and to give part of it to charity and everything else. ‘The government should not be taxing me again when I have already paid tax for it. ‘It is unfair and there is a lot more people who have to pay inheritance tax now because house prices are rising and you pay it on your whole estate.’ Some people are forced to sell the family home when one member dies to pay the inheritance tax bill, she said. ‘I have heard some horror stories where someone has lived in the family home for 20-25 years and they have to actually move out of the family home to pay the tax.’ Many parents also want to provide their children with a nest egg for big life expenses, like going to university. Mrs Mone went on: ‘If the worst scenario happens sometime they pay the tax on the estate, they cannot even afford to go to university. They cannot afford to live the life that people with lots of money do.’ She was appearing on the programme with musician and businessman Peter Buffett, the son of magnate Warren Buffett who is worth an estimated $58billion. Peter Buffet insisted he had made his own way in life without relying on his father’s wealth/ . ‘It comes down to the question of how much is enough. That is why I definitely agree with my father and have experienced it myself. I believe self-respect comes from earning its own reward,’ he told the programme. ‘I am very proud of the world I have built myself. I think if I lived off my father’s wealth or do in the future I am going to frankly wonder if I could have done it myself.’ However his argument was undermined when he admitted that as a young man he had been given shares in his father’s firm worth $250,000 in today’s money. Peter Buffett, son of multibillionaire tycoon Warren Buffett, said he had built his own life but admitted receiving shares from his father as a young man . This week Mr Cameron suggested the Tories could go further to target older voters, with an increase in the inheritance tax threshold planned for the manifesto. Before the 2010 election the Conservatives promised to raise it to £1million, freeing most families from paying the duty at all. But the idea was a victim of the power-sharing talks with the Lib Dems and never became coalition policy. Mr Cameron insisted the idea would be resurrected ahead of the 2015 election. Prime Minister David Cameron said he wanted to increase the amount of money people can leave loved ones without being hit by inheritance tax . Speaking to Saga members in Peacehaven, near Brighton, East Sussex, the Prime Minister said: ‘Would I like to go further in future? Yes, I would. ‘I believe in people being able to pass money down through the generations and pass things on to their children. I think you build a stronger society.’ He added: ‘Inheritance tax should only be paid for by the rich. It shouldn't be paid for by people who have worked hard and saved, and bought a family house in, say, Peacehaven. ‘So the ambition is still there and I would like to go further. It's better than it was, but it didn't make it into the coalition agreement. It's something we will have to address in our manifesto.’","Multimillionaire businesswoman says death taxes are unfair .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, Prince George's new nanny, is apparently listed on a register in her native Palencia, northern Spain, for failing to pay the Spanish equivalent of council tax . Prince George’s new Spanish ‘supernanny’ is facing claims that she is a tax dodger. Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, 43, is apparently  listed on a register in her native Palencia, northern Spain, for failing to pay the Spanish equivalent of council tax. Miss Borrallo, who studied at the elite Norland College in Bath, apparently appeared on the online register – known as the Official Provincial Gazette - in May 2007 and July 2008 for failing to pay property tax, known as IBI. However, a source told the Daily Mirror that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s new full-time nanny had now resolved the issue and no longer owed council chiefs any money. The source said: ‘It’s a major source of embarrassment to her that her name is still on a public debtors’ list which is just a click of a mouse away. ‘Maria Teresa might like to see it removed from the public arena but there’s absolutely nothing she can do about it.’ Miss Borrallo was appointed by Kensington Palace a couple of weeks ago but was only named officially last Thursday. She will be joining the royal couple and their young son on their forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand. Council officials in Palencia said they could not confirm when Miss Borrallo settled her debts but a spokesman told the Daily Mirror: ‘The gazettes enable public institutions to defend themselves against those who don’t want to pay taxes they owe as it means they can’t go round claiming they haven’t been informed.’ Earlier this week, friends claimed the Spanish nanny would have become a nun if she had not ended up pursuing her passion for looking after children. They said her austere lifestyle made her the perfect candidate to become a servant of God. One said: ‘We all thought she would end up becoming a nun because she was such a different girl to the rest. She hardly had any friends and she didn’t show any interest in boys.’ Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, 43, from northern Spain, was unveiled as Prince George's new full-time nanny last week and will join the royal couple on a forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand . With their upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand signalling the start of more frequent public engagements, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were eager to secure an aide for Prince George . Miss Borrallo, nicknamed Santa - Spanish for saint – by those closest to her when she was a youngster, was born in Madrid but moved to Palencia as a child. She is the second eldest of four children. She attended church regularly with the rest of her family as she was growing up and locals in her home city said they would not have been surprised if she had ended up choosing a church job like her brother Luis, who ordained a deacon in 2011. However, she instead decided to travel to England where she spent three years at the prestigious Norland College, where childcare training costs £36,000 and graduates learn the art of taekwondo and stunt driving. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said they would not be commenting about Miss Borrallo's tax but said they remained 'very happy' she had been appointed.

"By . Paul Donnelley . The parents of a British woman who went missing from a Disney cruise liner are suing the company for $75,000 (£45,000). Rebecca - known to her family as 'Bex' - Coriam, 24, vanished from the Disney Wonder three years ago as the ship sailed off the coast of Mexico. It is thought Miss Coriam, who was a . youth worker on the vessel, may have fallen overboard but her parents . Mike and Ann Coriam, from Chester, have struggled to get answers about . her disappearance. Carefree: Bex Coriam on holiday in Mexico when she was 16. In 2011, she went missing off the coast of the country . Happier times: Rebecca Coriam in her Disney youth worker uniform (left) is believed to have fallen overboard while working on a Disney cruise ship in March 2011; carefree Becky wearing her Micky Mouse ears at a party . And they have now have filed court papers in the US against Disney claiming the entertainment giant was negligent and failed in its duty of care. Miss Coriam’s parents claim that Disney had no appropriate surveillance equipment on board the ship, no man overboard monitors and that emergency protocols were not followed. It’s alleged that it took more than three hours for the company to check CCTV footage, more than four hours to alert the US Coast Guard, more than five hours to contact the Mexican navy and nearly seven hours to call police. Rebecca Coriam, 24, a youth worker from Chester, vanished from the Disney Wonder three years ago as the ship sailed off the coast of Mexico . Distraught: Mike and Ann Coriam, the parents of Rebecca who disappeared whilst working on a Disney cruise ship in March 2011, are suing the entertainment giant . Although it was estimated that Miss Coriam could have survived in the sea for 14 hours, the ship kept on going and never turned back to search for her. Mrs Coriam, 54, said: ‘Why would they not turn around? If it was their daughter would they have done? ‘We watched that ship sail out on the next cruise full of people laughing and cheering, playing the tune ‘When You Wish Upon A Star’, and our daughter was gone.’ She added: ‘No matter how powerful [Disney] are, people need to know what happened to us.’ In memoriam: Ann Coriam had this stone made in honour of her daughter Rebecca who disappeared while working on a Disney cruise ship in March 2011 . Never to be forgotten: Rebecca Coriam's parents wistfully stare out to sea, holding their daughter's jumper (left) and light a votive candle in her memory . Disney say there’s no ‘merit’ in the legal action. Miss Coriam was last seen making a phone call to a friend from the staff quarters and the alarm was raised four hours later when she failed to turn up for the start of her shift. An investigation by police in the Bahamas, where they ship was registered, found no evidence of foul play. A spokesman for Disney Cruise Lines said: ‘This incident has been investigated by the authorities. The claims are without merit, as we will demonstrate in court.’ The company have until April to respond to the court papers when a judge will decide whether the case can be heard.","Bex Coriam from Chester vanished three years ago off the coast of Mexico .

"By . Hugo Gye . Prince Charles has called for Britain's cities to abandon glitzy skyscrapers in favour of smaller 'mid-rise' buildings in order to ease the housing crisis and allow more young people to own their own homes. The heir to the throne added that young people were being 'driven away' by spiralling house prices, saying that the dream of buying a home was 'becoming further and further out of reach'. A report released by one of Charles's charities today warns against the influx of high-rise buildings into London, which it claims are making the UK's capital indistinguishable from cities such as Singapore and Dubai. Plea: Prince Charles has warned that young people are being frozen out of the housing market . Plan: A report compiled by one of the prince's charity demanded a change to how London is built . Inspection: Charles inside a flat in Richmond examining the living conditions of a local resident . The prince was talking at the Housing London Symposium in south west London, to mark the launch of the report by the Prince's Foundation for Building Community. The report suggests mid-rise buildings should replace high-rise skyscrapers which it describes as 'glittering towers of exclusivity and luxury living'. London has recently seen the construction of prestigious but unaffordable buildings such as One Hyde Park, the Shard and Vauxhall Tower. Statistics: Britain is not building enough new homes to meet the demand from citizens . Developers involved with the skyscrapers have been criticised for selling much of their space to foreign investors who do not intend to live in their multi-million-pound flats all year round. Instead, the report calls for the construction of 'mid-rise' buildings between five and eight storeys high - and the creation of community squares with mansion blocks which are affordable. Across the UK there is an annual need for 250,000 to 300,000 new homes, but only between 100,000 and 150,000 are being built each year. It has been predicted that be 2021 there will be a backlog of 1.1million homes. Although One Hyde Park is a lower-rise block, it was built in Knightsbridge, one of London's most expensive property markets, and marketed solely at the super rich, with owners of the 86 luxury apartments including oil barons and Arab sheiks. Last year one of the apartments in the complex was on the market for £65million, while ten flats in the Shard have price tags of between £30million and £50million. Prince Charles said today that the focus on ultra-prime housing had damaged young people's prospects of buying a home. He said: 'Home ownership for this generation is seemingly becoming further and further out of reach.' He added: 'The National Housing Federation estimates that in only six years' time the average London house price will have risen 40 per cent to £650,000. 'This isn't sustainable and risks driving away talented young individuals who are starting their careers in London and spending most of their income on rent.' The prince suggested that high-rise buildings divorced from their surrounding created a sense of 'alienation and social dysfunction' because they lead to social segregation with some areas dominated solely by the ultra-rich. He added: 'Mid-rise buildings of between five and eight storeys make ecological sense too as they are more adaptable than high-rise, easier to build out of natural materials, are easier to repair and still work for people when the lift is broken or there is a power cut. 'On the building side, mid-rise buildings also allow a greater diversity of developers and builders as the initial outlays required by high-rise buildings make it the business of relatively few.' Criticism: Buildings like One Hyde Park are closed off to all but the wealthiest people in British society . Glamour: But the Shard does little to help most Londoners, according to the new report . Dominic Richards, executive director of the Prince's Foundation, insisted that abandoning skyscrapers and restoring parks and gardens would be truer to London's original character. 'Mid-rise looks like London - not Singapore or Dubai,' he told the Evening Standard. 'If you have six or seven floors you can still get light on the other side of the road, you can still create green spaces and it fits with the existing vernacular. What we are really saying is ""more London please"".' The report also uses Paris as an example of success, with classic Haussman era apartment blocks in the centre of the city are only around six storeys high. Mr Richards also suggested that new developments should be accessible to mix of people from different backgrounds, including key workers living in affordable homes. Last week a leading planning expert warned that parts of Britain would soon resemble 'bland homogenous metropolises' thanks to an emphasis on office blocks and shopping centres at the expense of more organic neighbourhood growth. Contrast: Areas such as Notting Hill are popular because of their 'mid-rise' scale,  the report says . The foundation's report recommends the use of brownfield sites and increasing the density of the inner city, as well as building major new developments and restoring housing estates. It focuses primarily on London, where inflation in house prices has been even higher than elsewhere, but suggests that its conclusions are widely applicable across other parts of the UK. The report reads: 'The problem of housing failures, either in quality or quantity - as well as of the ubiquitous skyscraper model that is beginning to render city skylines indistinguishable from one another, while on the ground streetscapes are brutalised - can be recognised in cities the world over.'","Prince warns buying a home is 'further and further out of reach' for young Britons .
