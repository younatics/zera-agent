"From Damien Hirst sacrificing 9,000 butterflies to Tracey Emin scrawling the names of every one of her lovers onto a tent, some artists make a living out of pushing boundaries.

"Click here to read Jon Dolan's assessment of whether former Arsenal man Fabregas will be welcomed to Stamford Bridge. Cesc Fabregas completed his shock £30million switch to Chelsea yesterday and confirmed Arsenal snubbed the chance to re-sign him. However, the blow of seeing Fabregas in a Chelsea shirt has been softened by a hefty £5.6million windfall as part of the Spaniard's move to Stamford Bridge. In what is one of the most unexpected moves of the summer so far, the Spain international has signed a five-year deal at Stamford Bridge, understood to be worth in the region of £150,000-per-week.

Fabregas came through the ranks at Arsenal, and went on to captain the side before returning to boyhood club Barcelona in 2011. Arsenal secured a first-option buy-back clause as part of the £35million deal which saw Fabregas return to Catalonia. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger had considered taking up the option once it became clear Barca were looking to sell the midfielder.

I would like to thank everyone at FC Barcelona where I enjoyed three . wonderful years. It was my childhood club and I will always be proud and . honoured that I had a chance to play for such a great team. Right move? Fabregas believes signing for Jose Mourinho's side was the 'best choice' 'I . do feel that I have unfinished business in the Premier League and now . is the right time for me to return. Yes, everyone knows that Arsenal had . the first option to sign me. They decided not to take this option and . therefore it wasn't meant to be. I wish them well in the future. 'I considered all the other offers very carefully and I firmly believe that Chelsea is the best choice. 'They . match my footballing ambitions with their hunger and desire to win . trophies.

"A transplant surgeon at a leading hospital has saved his mother's life by donating one of his own kidneys. It is thought to be the first time in the world that a transplant doctor has donated an organ. Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when told his 64-year-old mother Dilshad, who had been on dialysis for five years, might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney. Family affair: Transplant surgeon Dr Asim Syed (right) saved his mother Dilshad's life by donating one of his own kidneys for a procedure at Hammersmith Hospital in London where he works . The worried surgeon brought her to London from her home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, to be cared for at his hospital. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother and two other patients on whom he had recently operated. Mrs Syed said: 'When I came round . from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said . was: ""Mum now all your worries are over"".' Other members of the family were either not a correct match for Mrs Syed or were not fit enough to donate. However, . it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood . group, so the only way for him to donate directly was for his mother to . go through a special blood-washing process to remove antibodies that . would reject his kidney. He . consulted colleagues about blood-washing, but they were reluctant to . use the method because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired or pooled donation. This is where would-be donors who are not a correct match can find a correct match through an anonymous donor chain. Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants - . involving three donors and three  recipients from three transplant . centres - took place simultaneously on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney . going to a recipient in the Midlands and  Mrs Syed receiving her kidney . from a person in the south of England. Now mother and son are recovering well . with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs Syed is staying with him for . several months while the hospital monitors her progress. Dr Syed with his mother and father Azmat, who is also a doctor. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother and two other patients on whom he had recently operated . He said: 'I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering but it wasn't as straightforward as we had hoped. 'A pooled donation was the only way of guaranteeing mum would get a transplant quickly. 'Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a  chain you all help each other. By volunteering in such a way we took three people off dialysis.' Mrs Syed said: 'Because Asim was a transplant surgeon he recognised how ill I was becoming. 'He whisked me down to London to be seen by his colleagues. They  stabilised me so that I was fit enough for a transplant. Until I met the team at the Hammersmith no one had mentioned a pooled donation. 'I'm not sure I'd have got a transplant if it hadn't been for Asim being in transplants. He knew exactly what was needed.' Dr Syed works at Hammersmith Hospital (pictured), where his boss operated on him and his mother to perform the kidney transplant . Dr Syed's father Azmat, 69, who has been a GP in Doncaster for 36 years, said: 'We were reluctant for Asim to donate because he is young, but his sister and older members of the family weren't suitable for donation. 'My wife really needed a transplant and Asim was aware that being on  dialysis is not a bed of roses. It's far from ideal and a lot of patients find leading a normal life quite difficult.' Dr Syed Jr said: 'People think that once you are on dialysis your life is not at risk. When I looked at the statistics I was quite shocked. 'Only 30 per cent of dialysis patients survive to five years and at ten years only ten per cent are alive. 'Being on dialysis is not good for the body because not all the toxins are  removed and because people are not dialysed often enough. 'Patients only go on dialysis three times a week in hospital because there are not enough machines. Ideally patients should dialyse every day or five or six times a week.' Dr Syed's boss, Professor Nadey Hakim, performed both transplants. He said: 'What a magnificent gesture. Asim knows how vital it is to get more live donors. When his mum needed help he knew what he had to do.'

"A father-of-two has blasted bosses who sacked him after he took part in the ice bucket challenge to raise money for charity. Matthew Hearn, 30, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, was stunned when he was dismissed by bosses for taking part in the charity challenge - particularly as he claims he was given the go-ahead by his regional manager. The father-of-two hoped his employers at Freeport Fleetwood shopping centre would see the funny side of his prank but he was sacked, as bosses say he took part in the challenge during working hours. Scroll down for video . Matthew Hearn pictured with daughter Emily, three, and partner Stacey Carley holding baby Macey . Mr Hearn (pictured) took part in the ice bucket challenge and had hoped employers would see the funny side . But Mr Hearn claims that filming of the challenge took place after his shift finished at 3pm. A fellow work colleague was so outraged by Mr Hearn's treatment that he quit in disgust. Mr Hearn, the sole breadwinner for a family of four, including his newborn baby Macey and three-year-old daughter Emily, said: 'I'm fuming, as you can imagine. 'I'm out of work and I've got two kids I have to provide for . 'I'm gutted by it because I feel I was doing a great job there.' Mr Hearn's partner Stacey Carley, 28, said: 'We're both shocked. I don't have a job at the moment because I stay at home with the children so this is really going to set us back now.' Immediately following the sacking Ms Carley posted on her Facebook page: 'Being sacked from a full time job for doing the ALS ice bucket challenge outside of work hours, in your own time, but because it was ""on site""  - in other words behind shops, out of public view - that's grounds for dismissal? Even though permission at the time was given by the area manager? 'Jobs are hard enough to come by sometimes these days. 'Freeport should be seen to encourage and support charities not the opposite!' Mr Hearn had held the position of cleaning manager at the complex since June - a service sub-contracted by the centre to Care Facility Management. Mr Hearn (pictured) with the letter he was given following his dismissal from his role as cleaning manager . The letter (pictured) given to Mr Hearn after he was sacked for taking part in the ice bucket challenge . He decided to do the challenge with two colleagues last Saturday. But on Tuesday he was told of disciplinary proceedings against him, before his termination was made official on Wednesday by Care Facility Management. Mr Hearn added: 'One of the most disgusting things about it was I thought a bit of charity would be encouraged.' One of his colleagues who was involved in the stunt, Thomas Turner, resigned in protest at Mr Hearn's sacking. Mr Turner, 21, himself a father-of-one, was working as a cleaner when the challenge took place. Mr Turner, from South Shore, Blackpool, said: 'Everybody else has been doing it and its for a good cause. Mr Hearn's ice bucket challenge saw him don a snorkel and mask as a colleague poured water over him . 'Sacking somebody for doing something for charity is ridiculous.' Mr Hearn's bosses admitted the ice bucket challenge had led to the sacking. Jim MacKinnon, Care Facility Management's director, said: 'This incident involving the ice bucket challenge within his working hours at the centre was a contributing factor. 'It was one of the reasons he did not meet our requirements for the role.' Freeport Fleetwood centre manager, John Magee said: 'We are fully supportive of members of staff who wish to get involved in charitable activity on our site. 'Just last week another member of staff asked permission to perform her ice bucket challenge within the centre outside of working hours, which was fine.'","Matthew Hearn, 30, was sacked after taking part in the charity challenge .

"They say it won't happen, at least not on Friday, but in the event the Mayan prophecy of the end of the world is right, scientists have foretold a raft of bloody and catastrophic fates for us all. Dark comets, famine, super-volcanoes, catastrophic climate change, and a plague of cancers are just some of the ends that could fulfill the prophecy. Astrophysicist Professor Jocelyn Bell . Burnell, who discovered pulsars, believes the most likely disaster that . could pencil Doomsday into Friday's diary is a black comet. Scroll down for video . A dark comet slamming into the earth could be as destructive as the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs . Such an end would match that of the dinosaurs who after walking the planet for about 165 million years - homo sapiens has been around for a mere 200,000 years - were killed off by a 10km asteroid or comet that slammed into the planet. Professor Bell Burnell believes if the world as we know it is to end on December 21 it would have to be a dark comet that strikes. Dark comets have little of the ice and snow that most comets have, and a lot more dust which makes it much more difficult to spot them as they speed through Space. 'Comets normally are big, dusty snowballs. A dark comet has not much snow and a lot of dust. They are much harder to get a handle on,' she said. The collision itself, except for those near the point of impact, would be unlikely to be fatal to the world's population but it would throw up so much dust into the atmosphere that billions of people could expect a slow death. Huge quantities of dust would bring on an 'eternal winter' in which the sun would be obscured and crops around the world would fail, leading to mass famine. Dr Dave Rothery, a volcanologist at the Open University, foretells a similar end but he thinks the death-bringing dust would be put into the atmosphere by a supervolcano. Hundreds of cubic miles of debris will be blasted into the atmosphere if a super-volcano erupts on Friday . A dark comet or a super-volcano would put so much dust into the atmosphere that there would be catastrophic crop failure . More than 240 cubic miles of molten rock and debris are blasted into the sky by super-volcanoes. Much of it would remain in the atmosphere as volcanic dust which would, just as with a massive asteroid or comet, block out the sun and cause famine. 'It would put so much ash and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere that photosynthesis may break down,"" he warned. A similar, albeit less devastating, even took place in 1816 when a volcano in Indonesia erupted and put so much dust into the atmosphere that it became known as 'the year of no summer'. Other scientists asked by The Times what cataclysms could bring on the end of the world on Friday, in line with what many people believe is foretold by the ancient Mayan prophecy, included Bryan Lovell, a former president of the Geological Society. His favourite Doomsday scenario was a vast escape of methane caused by an undersea landslide. Methane is a greenhouse gas but it is about 20 times more powerful in warming the world than is carbon dioxide. Dr Lovell said a huge release of sub-sea methane deposits would accelerate man-made climate change and lead to 'catastrophic climate change not too many Fridays from now'. But it is not just scientists who are putting forward theories as to how the world will end and they range from the unlikely to the fantastical. Among the favourites is that a rogue planet, Nibiru, which has long been inhabiting the far reaches of the solar system, beyond even Pluto, is now on a collision course with Earth. Scientists have dismissed the theory as ridiculous not just because no one has ever managed to detect it in the outer reaches of the solar system but because if such a large object was heading this way it would have been spotted by now . Scepticism on the part of experts, however, has done little to diminish the determination of thousands of people to find a safe haven from disaster. Authorities have closed off the French village of Bugarach and its mountain in France as Doomsday devotees sought sanctuary there from the end of the world. In France the authorities have had to bar New Age followers from travelling to Bugarach, a tiny village home to fewer than 200 people, and the 'mystical mountain' where it is located. Doomsday fanatics have identified Bugarach as a place of safety on the grounds that aliens live hidden within the mountain and are waiting for the end of the world when they will rescue humans in the area. 'I have issued an order barring anyone from climbing the mountain. And those trying to get into the village will be stopped and asked what their business is,' said Regional prefect Eric Freysselinard. The village and the mountain will only be re-opened to outsiders two days after the end of the world is scheduled to have taken place. Forecasts that the world will end on Friday are based on an ancient Mayan calendar which ends on December 12, 2012 . The Doomsday prophecy is based on an ancient calendar from the Mayan civilisation that was based in what is now Guatemala in in Central America. The calendar lasts for more than 5,000 years but comes to an end on Friday, which has prompted fears it forecasts the end of the world. Other favourite Doomsday scenarios include a vast solar storm which will flare out from the Sun and engulf the Earth. An alternative doom-laden theory is that a rogue black hole will swallow up the Earth, or that a quirk of galactic alignments will trigger a disastrous reversal of the Earth's magnetic field. Vivienne Parry, a former presenter of Tomorrow's World, suggested a cancer that starts in foxes but can be transmitted to humans. Man's best friend? A plague of cancers passed from foxes to people via dogs is one way the world could end. Dogs, she suggested, would cease to be man's best friend and instead become man's worst enemy because the cancer would be transmitted through them. Foxes would bite the dogs, transmitting the cancer to them, and they would bite their human owners. She said that were all dogs to be destroyed as soon as people realised they were passing on an untreatable cancer the end of the world for humans could be postponed. But she suspects man's love of his canine companions would seal his fate because putting down every dog would be too much to ask.

"Attack: Mervyn King called for a cultural change in British banking when he spoke today (pictured) The Bank of England yesterday piled pressure on the Treasury to split the traditional high street operations of banks from their risky casino arms. Governor Sir Mervyn King said the latest abuses by UK lenders reinforced the need to press on with the sweeping reforms recommended by the Independent Commission on Banking. He said the proposals by the ICB, which was chaired by Sir John Vickers and included ring-fencing retail banking from investment banking, should be implemented in full. It set up a potential clash with Chancellor George Osborne who has been accused of watering down some of the main proposals following months of lobbying by the banking industry. Sir Mervyn said: ‘I would hope that Parliament would legislate on that as soon as they feel able to do so – all of the Vickers proposals. That is what we need to do to change the structure of the industry.’ He added: ‘We can see what has gone wrong. The idea that the culture of investment banking is the same as the culture of basic banking, I think it is very clear now that those two cultures are completely different, and they need to be separated.’ Officials played down any differences between the Governor and the Chancellor but the comments were seen as a warning to the Treasury not to back down. It is hoped that the ring-fence will allow an investment bank rocked by heavy trading losses to fail without hurting savers, borrowers and small businesses. Sir Mervyn said: ‘The main thing is to ensure that if the trading mentality leads to practices that we regard as rather unacceptable that it does not impinge on the part of the banking system about which we really care. ‘It is very important to recognise that as a society we really do want to underpin retail deposits, lending to households and SMEs (small and medium enterprises). ‘But we do not want to underpin people’s decisions to take risky portfolio investments, therefore the two should not be on the same balance sheet.’ Sir Mervyn said there was no need for . a Leveson-style inquiry, although he admitted 'something went very . wrong with the UK banking industry and we need to put it right'. Yesterday, . leading politicians including Labour's Ed Miliband called for an . official inquiry into the conduct of banks, after it emerged Barclays . and RBS were embroiled in attempts to fix the inter-bank lending rate. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured arriving for an EU leaders summit in Brussels this week, insisted the Government was committed to shaking up the banking system . Taxpayer-backed . Royal Bank of Scotland also confirmed it was being investigated for . manipulating the rates at which banks lend to each other, known as . Libor. Sir Mervyn said: . 'From excessive levels of compensation, to shoddy treatment of . customers, to a deceitful manipulation of one of the most important . interest rates and now news of yet another mis-selling scandal we can . see we need a real change in the culture of the industry.' He added that hard-working bank staff have been 'let down' and that banks now needed 'leadership of an unusually high order'. David Cameron insisted the Government was committed to shaking up the banking system. ‘British people are crying out for a return to good old-fashioned banking and not put that at risk by big investment banking,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘That’s why the Governor is so in favour of changing culture at the banks and so am I.’ When the White Paper was published this month Sir John welcomed the proposed legislation but said that it ‘should go further’ on some points. ‘We welcome that the ICB proposals have been accepted in large part but urge the Government to resist pressure to weaken their effectiveness,’ he added. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) revealed earlier that Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group had agreed to pay compensation to customers who were mis-sold interest-rate hedging products. Some 28,000 of the products have been sold since 2001 and may have been offered as protection - or to act as a hedge - against a rise in interest rates without the customer fully grasping the downside risks. The City regulator has slammed banks ever since for authorising the deals, which are so complicated that many entrepreneurs simply didn't understand them. Many of those clients are now facing bankruptcy. Speaking during a visit in Lincoln . with war veterans ahead of Armed Forces Day tomorrow, Ed Miliband called . for an inquiry into the whole industry and said it was clear that change was . needed at Barclays. His calls were backed by shadow . chancellor Ed Balls, who said there was a case for an inquiry into the . culture of banking, while business secretary Vince Cable voiced no . objections. Inquiry: Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband, pictured yesterday, said it was clear that change was . needed at Barclays while shadow chancellor Ed Balls, right, said there was a case for an inquiry into the banking culture . The . Leveson Inquiry, presided over by Lord Justice Leveson, was set up by . Prime Minister David Cameron in July last year to look into the ethics . and practices in the press following the phone hacking scandal that has . engulfed News International. The Labour leader said: 'We definitely need an inquiry into the culture and practices of the industry. 'What's been revealed with Barclays is . a set of practices which have appalled people across the country and . we've got to make sure we shine a light in all the corners of the . industry to find out why these practices have been going on and what it . is about the culture that has enabled this to happen.' He added: 'I think its pretty clear the change that is required at Barclays. 'I think it's very hard to see that being led by Bob Diamond. 'If I was a shareholder in Barclays I . would be asking myself 'Well, obviously we need big change here. Who is . going to be able to bring that change and restore confidence in Barclays . and the system?' Scandal: Barclays boss Bob Diamond will forgo his bonus after the bank was hit with a record fine over market rigging . 'I am calling for change at Barclays. It's obviously a matter for the shareholders in the end but I think that . it is very hard to see how the current leadership, who were there when . some of these things were going on, can bring about the changes . required.' Mr Balls told . BBC News: 'I don't think it's right for the Government ministers or the . Governor to say we have had enough inquiries. 'Why is there a culture where people . in quite senior positions seem to think they can get away with rigging . markets and acting in a duplicitous way? 'I do think that these calls we are . seeing today for a proper, independent, arm's-length inquiry which looks . at the future and how we can get back on to a more open and honest . footing, but also looks at the self-regulation of the 1980s and 1990s . and the way in which the FSA regulated in the last decade - I think . there is now a case. 'We can't just brush this under the . carpet. People are shocked by the swaggering arrogance of what we have . discovered in the last 24 hours. We need to open this wide open.' On Wednesday it emerged that Barclays was fined £290 million by UK and US regulators for manipulating the rate at which banks lend to each other, and echoes the costly payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal that emerged last year. Banks are facing the threat of a criminal investigation over fixing the interbank lending figures that affect millions of homeowners and small firms. The Treasury has started to look at strengthening criminal sanctions for those responsible for market abuse after the FSA exposed the dealings at Barclays on Wednesday. Under the spotlight: HSBC and taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland are . among several other lenders being investigated by the City watchdog .

"England won their World Cup dress rehearsal against Wales by getting their RBS 6 Nations off to a perfect start with a 21-16 victory at the Millennium Stadium. Wales took a 10-0 lead inside eight minutes, with Rhys Webb scoring the game's first try, and led 16-8 at the interval. But Bath pair Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph both grabbed tries as England shut out Wales in the second half and won for the first time in Cardiff after trailing at the break.

Serious question will be asked about why he was allowed to play on after appearing to be knocked out twice. Dan Biggar – 7 . Another player to suffer a nasty head injury but shrugged it off to make an extremely assured contribution. England fly-half George Ford scored two penalty kicks to seal the victory in Six Nations . Rhys Webb (Phillips 69) – 8 . Fantastic first try appeared to set Wales on their way. Showed why he is now first-choice No9 ahead of Mike Phillips. Gethin Jenkins (James 59) – 5 . Struggled in the tight for second year running and came as no surprise when he was substituted. Richard Hibbard – 6 . Some powerful carries and determined tackling but not enough of a contribution in loose. Samson Lee – 6 . Another who struggled in the scrum but recovered from early setback to make a strong contribution. Jake Ball – 6 . Welsh line out functioned reasonably well and Ball was also prominent in the loose. A fine player. Alun Wyn Jones – 7 . The dominant lock in British rugby had his hands full with Dave Attwood. Went toe-to-toe and held his own. Dan Lydiate – 5 . Typically tenacious tackling display from the committed blindside forward. No impact in loose. Sam Warburton – 7 . A fine battle with Chris Robshaw and Wales definitely edged the breakdown battle in the first half. Taulupe Faletau – 7 . Brilliant pick up and pass from early scrum set up first try.

"James Rodriguez's surgery on a broken bone in his right foot was a success, his Real Madrid club said on Thursday. The operation was on the fifth metatarsal in the right foot, Madrid added on their website. The European champions did not say how long they expected him to be sidelined. James Rodriguez was pictured on crutches at the hospital in Murcia as he underwent foot surgery . Rodriguez hobbled off during Real Madrid's 2-1 win over Sevilla and will have a spell on the sidelines . Rodriguez was hurt after scoring the opening goal in the 2-1 La Liga win over Sevilla at the Santiago Bernabeu. He was substituted in the first half after doctors examined his foot on the sideline. The 23-year-old Rodriguez quickly became a first-choice selection for coach Carlo Ancelotti after his arrival following his outstanding World Cup with Colombia, when he was the top scorer with six goals and helped the team reach the quarterfinals. He has played in 33 of Madrid's 36 games this season, scoring 12 goals and assisting on 10 more. Real opened up a four-point lead at the top of La Liga ahead of their visit to Atletico on Saturday.

"This chilling series of images give an alarming projection of how some of America’s most famous tourism destinations could look in the future if scientists predictions about the effects of global warming prove correct. Pittsburgh-based researcher and artist Nickolay Lamm, 24, has created the shocking photo illustrations which show many of American’s most iconic destinations including the Washington Monument, Statue of Liberty and Miami’s South Beach submerged in up to 25 feet of water. It could take several centuries for sea levels to rise to that level but Lamm hopes his work will raise public awareness about the very real threat of global warming today, reports StorageFront. Popular tourist destination: The art deco district of Ocean Drive in Florida as it looks today .

The Washington Monument on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., built to commemorate George Washington, is one of the U.S.'s most popular tourist destinations . In the centuries to come the Washington Monument could be surrounded by water if sea levels rise by 25 feet . Boston is another area which could be significantly impacted by rising sea levels, these images show the harbor today, left, and then under 25ft of water, right . According to the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated  study released earlier this year, the consequences of climate change are now hitting the United States on several fronts, including health, infrastructure, water supply, agriculture and especially more frequent severe weather. The report claims observable change to the climate in the past half-century ‘is due primarily to human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuel,’ and that no areas of the United States are immune to change. ‘Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont have observed changes in their local climate that are outside of their experience,’ the report said. Months after Superstorm Sandy hurtled into the U.S. East Coast, causing billions of dollars in damage, the report concluded that severe weather was now the new normal. ‘Certain types of weather events have become more frequent and/or intense, including heat waves, heavy downpours, and, in some regions, floods and droughts,’ the report said. This series of images show how the Statue of Liberty might be impacted by rising sea levels, left, as it is today and then right, after an increase in sea level of five feet .

Holiday hotspot: South Beach in Florida as it looks today . South Beach in Florida could be totally submerged in the future if the sea levels rise 25 feet . Last year was the hottest year ever in the United States. According to the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate . Change, the seas will rise by an average of 6.6 feet by 2100. Then over the coming centuries, as temperatures rise and ice sheets melt, the oceans could rise as much as 20 or 30 feet. Lamm has created images which show how famous landmarks could look like under 5 feet (projected increase over the next 100 to 300 years), 12 feet (potential level in 2300), and 25 feet (the potential level in coming centuries) of water. The U.S. National Climate Assessment report notes that of an increase in average U.S. temperatures of about 1.5 degrees F since 1895, when reliable national record-keeping began, more than 80 percent had occurred in the past three decades. With heat-trapping gases already in . the atmosphere, temperatures could rise by a further 2 to 4 degrees F in . most parts of the country over the next few decades, the report said.

The Thomas Jefferson Memorial could be almost totally submerged if sea levels rise by 25 feet . These maps show Lamm's projections for which areas of New York and New Jersey would become submerged if sea level rose 25 feet, right, compared to now, left . Certain positive consequences of rising temperatures, such as a longer growing season, were said to be offset by more disruptive impacts, including: . ‘This draft report sends a warning to all of us: we must act in a comprehensive fashion to reduce carbon pollution or expose our people and communities to continuing devastation from extreme weather events and their aftermath,’ Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who heads the Senate environment committee, said in a statement.

"An Arriva bus pulling out on to Trafford Road bridge in Manchester is met by the unusual spectacle of a team of horses dragging carriages of freight. Meanwhile a modern 4x4 is parked just around the corner from a classic Ford Model T - in trademark black. These evocative images, showing a bizarre clash of past and present, demonstrate beautifully the way our cities have changed with the passage of time - and the ways they haven't. Past meets present: This image shows a bus pulling on to Trafford Road Bridge in Salford, blended with a team of three horses and carriages bearing goods from the nearby docks . Classic: This building appears to have remained unchanged, while in the surrounding area modern cars and traffic signs sit incongruously with two classic Ford Model T cars to the right . The march of time: Workers are seen headed in to Manchester Docks in the older picture, while the area is gated off in the present day . Created by Photoshop wizard and local historian Neil Pearson, the collection of images show a blend of scenes past and present in Manchester and Salford. Mr Pearson, a 46-year-old postal worker, finds eye-catching images showing his home city in bygone days, then takes his own from the exact same vantage. He then digitally blends the two to create an amalgamation of the past and present in a single image. He said: 'I don't look for any type of period really, just if a picture catches my eye and I know the area is still roughly the same I’ll see if I can create the image,' said Neil. Yesteryear: This composite image shows a goods vehicle emerging from a bustling Manchester Docks, while a modern car and a cyclist zip by in the present . Ceremonious: This images superimposes a wedding procession with an everyday pedestrian scene. The two images share an overcast sky . Vintage: An old-time bus and classic cars are seen against the colourful and glass-coated fronts of modern buildings . 'I’ll try and position myself in the exact same spot as the original photographer, capturing the same image but adding something modern to it. 'Once I have the current image I use Photoshop to blend the two images together and begin the process of trying to make it look as authentic as possible, which is sometimes easier said than done.' It sometimes takes days to edit the images to perfection, but Mr Pearson believes that the area around Salford and Manchester has remained largely unchanged. The city of Salford is home to around 210,000 people, and is one of a number of large settlements just outside of Manchester. It was an industrial centre in Victorian times, a period which peaked with the construction of the Manchester shipping canal, which forms the border with Manchester proper, in 1894. At the time it was the largest shipping canal in the world. The city suffered industrial decline throughout the 20th Century, as British manufacturing moved abroad, but has been regenerated in recent years thanks to projects like the BBC's Media City. Grand: The Adelphi building, now part of the University of Salford, seems much the same now as it did decades ago . Memory lane: This old-fashioned parade of shops has been intruded on by two modern vehicles . He explained: 'The most striking thing I see in my pictures is times change but the area doesn’t. 'In my area at least, a lot the old buildings still remain. 'I’d like to expand this project to other cities as I’m sure every city has its old buildings and streets that still remain.' Gone: An old-fashioned tram can be seen making its way down this street, while the overhead wires powering it have disappeared in the recent photograph. Through the looking-glass: The tower blocks seen on the left of the image would have been new in the early picture, while the bright blue footbridge in the background is a striking contrast to the black-and-white surroundings . Continuity: This ornate building pictured here still dominates the scene today .","Postal worker Neil Pearson, 46, blended archive images with his own to create an intriguing mix of past and present ."
"Chinese authorities have said two religious extremists carried out a terror attack at a train station in an apparent suicide bombing which also killed one other person and wounded 79. The official website for Xinjiang's regional government said police identified two suspects with a history of religious extremism, including a 39-year-old man from southern Xinjiang. It did not explicitly call Wednesday's attack at the station in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi a suicide bombing, but said the two men detonated explosives at a train station exit and both died on the spot. Scroll down for video . Chinese authorities have said two religious extremists carried out a terror attack at a train station in an apparent suicide bombing which also killed one other person and wounded 79 . The president of China Xi Jinping has demanded 'decisive actions' against terrorism  following the attack at the station . Police patrol outside the South Railway Station, where three people were killed and 79 wounded in the attack on Wednesday . Heavily armed Chinese paramilitary policemen march past the site of explosion at Urumqi South Railway Station . It was the third high-profile attack in seven months blamed on Xinjiang extremists that targeted civilians - two of the attacks outside the region - marking a departure from a previous pattern of primarily targeting local authorities in the long-simmering insurgency. Chinese President Xi Jinping demanded 'decisive' action against terrorism after the attack, which came just as he was wrapping up a four-day tour of Xinjiang aimed at underlining the government's commitment to security in the region. 'The battle to combat violence and . terrorism will not allow even a moment of slackness, and decisive . actions must be taken to resolutely suppress the terrorists' rampant . momentum,' Mr Xi said. The blasts went off at about 7pm just after a train had pulled into the station and as passengers were streaming out onto a plaza near a bus station. A 57-year-old woman being treated at the Xinjiang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital said she had just arrived from Sichuan province and was walking outside to meet her son when the blast went off. 'I saw I had shreds of flesh and blood in my hair and on my clothes. It was terrifying,' said the woman, who would only give her surname, Peng. The official website for Xinjiang's regional government said police identified two suspects with a history of religious extremism, including a 39-year-old man from southern Xinjiang. Pictured are paramilitary policeman standing guard near the exit of the station . It was the third high-profile attack in seven months blamed on Xinjiang extremists that targeted civilians marking a departure from a previous pattern of primarily targeting local authorities in the long-simmering insurgency . The blasts went off about at 7pm just after a train had pulled into the station and as passengers were streaming out onto a plaza near a bus station. A SWAT team police officer is pictured outside the station . Another survivor, a man who also gave only his surname, Liu, said the station exit had been crowded with people when the blast went off. 'After the blast, there was chaos. Everyone was panicking,' said Liu. Police and firefighters quickly arrived and Liu said the injured were taken to hospitals in ambulances and commandeered taxis. The official Xinhua News Agency quoted eyewitnesses as saying at least two blasts went off at the South Station, while a large group of attackers went after passengers. There was no immediate word on arrests and it was unclear whether Mr Xi was still in the region at the time of the attack. 'At the moment, it is acknowledged to be a terrorist attack. What is yet to be found out is who did this and for what purpose under whose instigation,' Xinhua said. Train service was suspended for about two hours, Xinhua said, and security was tightened at all transport hubs in the city, which has a mainly Han Chinese population who are distinct from Xinjiang's native Turkic Muslim Uighur ethnic group. There was no immediate word on arrests and it was unclear whether Mr Xi was still in the region at the time of the attack . Xinhua said the blast was centred on some luggage left on the ground between the station's exit and a bus stop . Chinese police guard the entrance to the Urumqi South Railway Station in Urumqi . A woman working at a convenience store near the train station said she heard a loud explosion shortly after 7pm local time yesterday. 'The whole area now has been cordoned off by police and military police,' she said, refusing to give her name. Photos circulating briefly on Chinese social media sites showed scattered luggage near the station's exit and a heavy presence of armed men. Xinhua said the blast was centred on some luggage left on the ground between the station's exit and a bus stop. Tensions between Chinese and Uighurs have been simmering for years in Xinjiang, particularly since 2009 rioting in Urumqi left nearly 200 people dead. The attack came on the day that China's president Xi Jinping ended a visit to the region. He has now promised 'decisive actions' following the attack . Beijing has at times blamed the violence on overseas-based instigators, but has offered little evidence. Last year, three Uighurs rammed a vehicle into crowds in a suicide attack near the Forbidden City gate in the heart of Beijing, killing themselves and two tourists. In March, five knife-wielding men and women believed to be Uighurs slashed at crowds indiscriminately at a railway station in south-western China, killing 29 people. While Beijing faults separatists for raising ethnic tensions, government critics say restrictive and discriminatory policies and practices have alienated the Uighurs. They say Han people have flooded Xinjiang and benefited from its economic growth while Uighurs have felt excluded. Three people were killed and dozens more injured in the attacks in Urumqi, pictured . China has smothered Xinjiang with additional security and imposed additional restrictions on Uighur travel rights, culture and religious practices. That, say Uighur activists, is exacerbating the resentments driving the violence. 'The Urumqi explosion again proves that forceful repression is not a solution to the problem,' said Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress based in Germany. During his visit to the region, Mr Xi urged government officials to maintain social stability, promote growth, improve living standards and strengthen ethnic unity, according to state media reports. 'Local police stations are the fists and the daggers. We must work hard at the grass-roots level of the police stations,' he said. 'We must take care of our front-line offices. You need to protect yourselves and make achievements at tasks such as better serving the people in the future and safeguarding social stability.' Mr Xi said China would deploy a 'strike-first strategy' in its fight against terrorism.","China says two suspects identified with history of religious extremism .

New signing Krystian Bielik was heavily involved, as the squad looked to impress Wenger enough to secure themselves a place in one of Arsenal's biggest games of the season. With both sides chasing the Champions Leagues places and with only two points separating them, the Arsenal boss says the north London derby is still very special. He said: 'Yes of course because the two teams are fighting very hard to be at the top of the league. It can be a spectacular game.' The Frenchman knows his side will be facing a hostile atmosphere at White Hart Lane on Saturday but is confident his players have the focus to see the game through. Wenger is confident his side have the focus to ignore the hostile atmosphere facing them at White Hart Lane . The impressive performances of Francis Coquelin have been a welcome boost for Wenger, whose Arsenal side are on the up after three wins . January signing Krystian Bielik smiles during training at Arsenal as he settles into his new surroundings in north London . 'In the derbies the home ground is not too significant sometimes because it’s a high commitment, high pace and we just focus on the quality of our game and our performance no matter where we play. We’ll do the same [on Saturday],' he added. The Gunners are in a rich vein of form winning their past three games, including an impressive victory away against Manchester City and Wenger puts this down to the confidence of his squad. 'Confidence, the fact that we defend better maybe,' he said. 'We have another good test [on Saturday] on that aspect of our game. After, football is fragile when you have not got confidence.

Nacho Monreal, trying to keep warm in gloves and a snood in the cold Friday morning weather, reacts during the Gunners' session . Cazorla (left) and Walcott look focused as they prepare for the trip to White Hart Lane in the Premier League on Saturday . 'When you have positive results behind you it makes everybody stronger and we have also recovered nearly all our defenders now, and that is of course important.' With Arsenal challenging for the top four, it's coming to a crucial part of the season and in the past they've been criticised for their squad size but the Frenchman feels he has a squad which can challenge. He said: 'I feel yes, of course, that is the target for us until the end of the season. 'We are four months in front of us, they are very important to everybody, and it's how well we can focus in every single game, how well we can perform together, that will decide our season.' Wenger was also highly critical of the January transfer window and thinks that it should be scrapped.

It pushes even more an idea forward - let's completely get rid of [the transfer window], and go from season to season with the same players. 'It can disturb the cohesion of a group within the season. When the players don’t play in October or the end of September, they already think that they may move in January. 'You lose them and in our job it’s important that everybody is on board. I find the transfer window disturbant.' Arsenal face a red hot Harry Kane on Saturday and the Gunners boss has been impressed with the striker in the first half of the season. Tottenham forward Harry Kane has impressed Wenger following his excellent start to the Premier League season . Mathieu Flamini, Kieran Gibbs, Olivier Giroud, Mesut Ozil and Gnabry (left-right) walk out to the training pitches at London Colney . Arsenal signed defender Gabriel from Villarreal during the Januaray transfer window, and he could make his debut against Tottenham . He said: 'He was absolutely outstanding until now. It’s impressive the way he has made his way through. His personality shows on the pitch. 'He’s one of the players that since the start of the season has made a big impact in the Premier League.' In light of Kane's arrival onto the Premier League scene, Wenger has backed the introduction of younger players and says if they can handle themselves against the best - then they have a chance. He replied: 'I’m convinced of that. That’s why I always say that the quota system is a false and superficial protection. 'When the players have the quality, they play, no matter where they are from. That’s why we have to support that. 'Let’s go for quality and get our young players to be confronted with top-quality players. If they make it then, they are really good players.' Bellerin has been in impressive form since coming into the first team to replace Mathieu Debuchy earlier in the season .

Finding: Scientists say an ingredient in honeysuckle tea actually acts like a 'viral penicillin' to beat influenza . Antibiotics have until now been the ‘magic bullets’ against most infections. But the discovery that a natural product can work in the same way promises to herald new treatments for the virus. Honeysuckle is a popular garden plant with highly perfumed flowers. There are approximately 180 species around the world, of which at least two are native to the UK and more than half of the rest to China. Researchers from the Nanjing University School of Life Sciences in China found that a compound in the plant, called MIR2911, directly targets influenza A viruses. The seasonal flu that hits millions of Britons every winter is a strain of either influenza A or B. Approximately 180 species: Honeysuckle is a popular garden plant with highly perfumed flowers (file picture) The severe pandemics that occasionally strike around the world, including swine flu and bird flu, are particularly dangerous strains of influenza A. In experiments on mice, various types of influenza A were effectively targeted by the honeysuckle compound. Ongoing tests also showed that it may work against Ebola virus, the study published in Cell Research found. Herbalists have also used honeysuckle for its anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and calming properties. So-called Japanese honeysuckle has been used in Chinese medicine to not only treat flu and fevers, but also diarrhoea and skin infections.","Antibiotics have until now been 'magic bullets' against most infections .

"Andy Murray will defy the sceptics over his working relationship with Amelie Mauresmo by striking a more substantial coaching deal than expected with the former women’s Wimbledon champion. The 27 year-old Scot, who returns to action this week at the Canadian Open in Toronto, appears to have persuaded Mauresmo to travel 25 weeks per year with him, which in top level tennis terms amounts to a full-blown commitment. Some doubted how much time she would be prepared to give to Murray, or whether she wanted to do the travelling necessary, but she is set to put in plenty more weeks than Ivan Lendl was doing towards the end of his tenure as coach. Staying together: Andy Murray will defy the sceptics over his working relationship with Amelie Mauresmo by striking a more substantial coaching deal . Mauresmo has spent weeks at Murray’s recent post-Wimbledon training camp in Miami – another thing that some doubted she would attend – and has accompanied him to Canada as preparations for the US Open start in earnest. A notable absentee from Toronto, I understand, will be Dani Vallverdu, his assistant coach and long-time cornerstone of his support staff. He is known to have been disturbed that he was not initially kept in the loop about Mauresmo’s appointment, only finding out when its likelihood was revealed by Sportsmail. He is said to have smoothed that over with his long-time friend, who explained that the whole French Open-Wimbledon period was the most difficult in which to settle coaching arrangements. Vallverdu gets on well with the ex French player, but the new structure around Murray will not see him travelling everywhere with the Scot as happened before. The Venezuelan will still work with Murray, but has this week off and then will join up with him for the Masters level event in Cincinatti that immediately follows Toronto. Sorted: The 27-year-old Scot appears to have persuaded Mauresmo to travel 25 weeks per year with him . The delay of an official announcement about Mauresmo seems to have been caused by it being holiday time and relevant lawyers drawing up the paperwork being on vacation. Murray swiftly returned to training following his surprise Wimbledon quarter final exit. He is said to have been pleased with the training block in Florida and how it has gone with Mauresmo, who has firm ideas but a more consensual approach than Lendl, who was very much a ‘my way or the highway’ type of operator. This week represents the start of a new phase of the Scot’s career in many senses, as he no longer carries around the Wimbledon champion tag, is fully over his back surgery, and down to number ten in the rankings. When the draw for Toronto came out on Friday night he was slightly shielded from his new reality by being bumped up into the top eight seedings and therefore getting a bye, only due to the long-term absence of Juan Martin Del Potro and the shock withdrawal of Rafael Nadal with a wrist injury. Murray’s first opponent will be either Colombian Santiago Giraldo or Nadal’s conqueror at Wimbledon, Australian Nick Kyrgios. Should he survive that he may face Novak Djokovic in the quarter finals. Frustration: Murray was knocked out of Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage against Grigor Dimitrov . The British number one has made clear that he will be taking to the two Masters level events ahead of Flushing Meadows with due seriousness as he tries to regain momentum for New York. He is said to be very motivated and, given that he only has a relatively paltry 630 ranking points to defend for the rest of the year, it can be expected that by the end of 2014 he will be back among the top seeds. Nadal, on the other hand, may take quite a ranking hit if the injury to his right wrist tendon does not clear. He excelled this time last year, winning Canada, Cincinatti and the U.S Open, and so has nearly a third of his computer points to defend in the next five weeks. While the damage to his tendon is not said to be severe any wrist problem cannot be easily dismissed in tennis and it is difficult to see him lining up in New York having not played since the Kyrgios upset. Djokovic got married after Wimbledon and his wife Jelena is soon expecting their first child, so his life is about to become more complicated. Other issues to look out for as tennis revives from its post-Wimbledon slumbers are whether Roger Federer – turning 33 this week - can keep his SW19 momentum going and if Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic can follow up on their semi-final appearances there.","The 27-year-old Scot appears to have persuaded Mauresmo to travel 25 weeks per year with him .

"How many times have you watched the weather forecast or consulted a weather app on your smartphone, only to be caught out in a heavy shower when experts claimed it would be sunny? This miserable scenario could be a thing of the past as a new app claims to give users the most accurate weather forecast yet. Climendo collates and compares data from the most popular and accurate providers of forecasts to deliver a definitive outlook for the day and week ahead. The Climendo app (pictured) collates and compares data from the most popular and accurate providers of forecasts to deliver a definitive outlook for the day and week ahead (pictured) The app, which is available on iPhone and Android handsets, collects meteorological predictions from 12 providers in the U.S. and Europe to provide an average forecast. It also matches predictions with historical data from 10,000 weather stations around the world to add weight to the most trusted providers’ predictions, Engadget reported. Based on the data, the app generates its own forecast for the coming five days, including predictions for the upcoming weather in six hours chunks. It also shows a ‘probability rate’ so that when lots of readings from different sources are similar, the chances of a sunny afternoon, for example, is 'certain', while when opinions and readings are mixed, the forecast is 'fairly certain' or 'uncertain,' warning users to prepare for potentially changeable conditions.

The app currently shows the temperature, weather conditions and wind speed for different cities, but its inventors promise that more detailed information is set to come. Climendo launched in Sweden last year and has now been redesigned for a global audience. It was invented by two surfers, David and Jacob von Corswant, who wanted to compare weather forecasts easily to find the best overall prediction and ensure a good surfing session. They said: ‘After 15 years of comparing forecasts manually and measuring the probability of certainty, we decided to find a simpler alternative. It was just too time consuming to go through the overwhelming number of weather apps in our phones.

'We soon realised that if not all, at least most people, go through a similar procedure of looking at two or more forecasts every day. This is how Climendo was born.’ They claim their app makes planning ahead a little bit easier . ‘More useful features will be added - forecasts from your local provider will soon be included - and the number of searchable countries and cities will increase,’ they said.

"Mr Harper resigned on Saturday after discovering the woman was a working illegally in this country . Former Immigration Minister Mark Harper paid his illegal Colombian cleaner using expenses, it emerged today. Mr Harper resigned on Saturday after discovering the woman was a working illegally in this country. Last night he said the woman’s status ‘did not reflect the documents that I saw’. The cleaner was named as Isabella Acevedo by the Daily Telegraph. She could now be removed from the country. Mr . Harper claimed more than £2,000 in parliamentary expenses to pay her to . clean his flat in the Westminster Square development near Waterloo . station. The newspaper . reported that Miss Acevedo worked for a number of people in the complex, . which is popular with MPs, raising the prospect of other politicians . being drawn into the affair. The Forest of Dean MP said: ‘There are now going to be legal consequences for her. What I will say is that I checked her documents - I took them from her. ‘You can draw your own conclusions from this but her status did not reflect the documents that I saw. ‘There was a reason I didn’t really mention it in my letter - I was being careful because obviously I don’t want to impact the case that will deal with her. ‘Obviously it was tempting to include everything in the letter but we didn’t want to do anything to prejudice our ability to deal with it.’ Yesterday a senior Cabinet Minister insisted Mr Harper had not broken the law but was holding himself to a ‘very high standard’. Officials said Mr Harper had not broken the law because she was self-employed and so not hired directly by him. But an immigration lawyer suggested Mr Harper could still be in line for a £5,000 fine because he failed to keep copies of the documents shown to him by his cleaner. Barrister Colin Yeo, writing on the Free Movement blog said Mr Harper ‘may well in fact have broken the law’. His failure to ‘take and retain copies of certain documents’ could be a breach of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. In his resignation letter to the Prime Minister Mr Harper said that when he took on the cleaner in April 2007, for his London flat, he took a copy of her passport and a Home Office letter suggesting she had ‘indefinite leave’ to stay in Britain. Mr Harper did nothing to check again when first made a minister in May 2010 nor when made Immigration minister in September 2012. Last month, he looked again, and was unable to find the documents. His cleaner gave him the documents again on February 4 but when they were checked by immigration officials they were found to be fake. Mr Harper has been replaced by Security Minister James Brokenshire . While accepting his resignation, David Cameron left the door open for Mr Harper to return to Government. He praised Mr Harper’s work on the Immigration Bill, and his ‘energy and loyalty’. The PM said: ‘You will be greatly missed and I hope very much that you will be able to return to service on the Frontbench before long.’ Home Secretary Theresa May praised Mr Harper as an ‘excellent’ minister who could be ‘proud of the role he has played in sharply reducing immigration to Britain’. Mr Harper has been replaced by Security Minister James Brokenshire. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show he was ‘really sad to see Mark go.’ ‘ . Had he been a member of the public, I don’t think he would have done anything wrong. But he set himself a very high standard and he failed that standard and, therefore, honourably, stood down.’ ‘The new legislation is reasonably light-touch. If this had been a member of the public they would have done nothing wrong.’ Yesterday critics seized on the issue to suggest it exposed flaws in the Government’s immigration crackdown. Labour said it should also prompt a rethink about the effectiveness of proposed new rules for landlords, employers, bankers and others to verify the status of foreign workers. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘As immigration minister he has argued in Parliament for landlords to be required to carry out checks on every tenant, and he is responsible for the helpline for employers to ring up to double-check the immigration status of their employees. ‘We have called for the landlord scheme to be piloted, and the employer helpline to be better resourced exactly because this can be complex for employers and landlords.’ ‘He has shown himself to be a decent man in his resignation and I wish him well for the future but perhaps once again the Government need to think very carefully about how they approach this issue as it’s clear there are limits to the effectiveness of relying on employer and landlord checks to address illegal immigration.’ In 2009 Labour Attorney General Baroness Scotland was fined £5,000 over her hiring of an illegal immigrant as her housekeeper - but refused to resign. She apologised for what she called a ‘technical breach’ of failing to take copies of the documents.","Mr Harper resigned on Saturday after discovering the woman was a working illegally in this country .

"A beach-goer has complained she was sexually harassed by a pervert using a flying drone to spy on women.

Then she realized what was happening: The women at the beach were being spied on by a remote-controlled drone.

And then, getting angry she said: 'I'm not worried about my PERSONAL SAFETY, though I am now worried a bit for YOURS. Your drone is creepy and violating. You need to take it out of the air, or I will.' Eventually, the woman convinced the drone pilot to pack up his gear and leave the beach. After the incident, she claimed drone should be banned in public places. 'Unless it's there for recording a public event, there is no place for that sort of thing,' she said. 'At the least, it is a sound annoyance (the buzzing). At the worst, it is a personal violation.'","Woman claimed she was sunbathing on a private beach in Virginia .

"The Dalai Lama issued a powerful call for personal responsibility yesterday, telling Britons hard work is the answer to economic difficulties. The exiled Tibetan leader also revealed he was shocked at last summer’s riots because he thought the English were ‘mature, sensible and law-abiding’. In his first visit to St Paul’s Cathedral, he pointed out that the recession was made by man – not God – and urged Britons to make ‘every effort’ to tackle the difficulties.

Criticising those who complain about problems rather than trying to solve them, he said: ‘Please don’t feel hopeless. ‘Work hard. Don’t just pray.

He said: ‘Life isn’t easy. There’s no guarantee.

The scenes of rampaging youths were something he was more used to seeing in third world countries, he said. ‘I always had the view Englishmen were mature people, sensible people, and law-abiding people,’ he added. ‘If such things happen in developing countries, that’s understandable. But in England that happened – I really thought “oh”. ‘I immediately sent a letter to the Prime Minister expressing my sadness and condolences.

"Militant preacher Anjem Choudary has been identified as a leading British influence for the Al Qaeda-linked terrorists who carried out the Kenya shopping mall atrocity, it emerged yesterday. London-based Choudary, who has been linked to dozens of terrorist suspects, is highlighted in a video issued by East African group Al-Shabaab. The video also says 11 Britons have died waging jihad in Somalia. One of the leading figures in Al-Shabaab – blamed for last month’s Nairobi attack which left 67 dead – is ‘white widow’ Samantha Lewthwaite. The whereabouts of Lewthwaite, former wife of 7/7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay, remains a mystery. Hate-preacher Anjem Choudary makes an appearance in the video saying that the British Prime Minster and President Obama treat 'Muslim blood like water' Mohammed Ansar, 39, left, a British documentary film-maker and journalist  was one of the figures singled out for criticising jihadists in the wake of the Lee Rigby's, right,  murder in Woolwich in May . A still from the video: The film opens with the narrator of the film, who has a British accent, praising the death of Lee Rigby and inciting others in the UK to carry out similar attacks . Counter-terrorism detectives at . Scotland Yard, who have been on a heightened state of alert following . the Kenyan outrage, are examining the 58-minute video by Al-Shabaab . which endorses Choudary. Called ‘Woolwich Attack: It’s an Eye . for an Eye’, the English-language production urges Muslims in Britain to . go to Somalia to fight jihad or carry out terror attacks in the UK if . they are unable to travel. It is the first such propaganda video to be entirely focused on recruiting Britons and inciting terror attacks in the UK. The content of much of the video . cannot be reported because of legal reporting restrictions and laws that . forbid the incitement of terrorism. Choudary, 46, features significantly . in the video and is lauded as a ‘Caller to Islam’, marking the first . time that he has been publicly endorsed by Al Qaeda. It suggested that he and a militant . colleague based in North-West London are the main points of contact for . Muslims eager to wage jihad in Somalia or Britain. Choudary is seen blaming British . foreign policy for terrorist attacks in the UK and warning of more . attacks. In a clip from the video – thought to be taken from the . internet – he says: ‘The Government want people to swallow something . that is completely nonsensical, it doesn’t make any sense: their foreign . policy has had a direct impact on the streets of London.’ The narrator is believed to be a . Briton who uses the name Abu Omar, who claimed that Muslims had turned . to jihad as ‘the only viable solution to counter the crusades engulfing . the entire Muslim world’. Scotland Yard said: ‘We are aware of the video and we are assessing its contents.’ Turning point: Mohammed Ansar, 39, made a BBC film about ex-English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, who he famously hugged in the aftermath of Lee Rigby's killing . Mohammed Ansar, 39, a British documentary film-maker and journalist was one of the figures singled out in the hour-long video. Police visited him on Wednesday evening to discuss safety arrangement for him and his family following the film's release. He also made a BBC film about ex-English . Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, who he famously hugged in the . aftermath of the killing. The . video is not widely available on the internet, but it opens with the . narrator of the film, who has a British accent, praising the death of Lee Rigby and inciting others in the UK to carry out similar attacks. Targets: Other figures threatened in the video include broadcaster Ajmal Masroor . Harar 24, which saw a version of the film reported: 'In the video certain Muslim scholars and community leaders are referred to as being on the “government’s payroll” for speaking against the Woolwich attack and “distancing themselves from the mujahideen"" '. 'Al-Shabaab in the video claims that the Woolwich attack was a result of British foreign policy, for killing Muslims and for aiding the United States in their “war of terror”' The narrator of the film, wearing a . black mask and holding an automatic weapon, tells viewers 'Do not . waste your time trying to re-invent the wheel.

They were being the messengers. They left me a telephone number to call in case of emergency or if I felt under any immediate danger. They did not give me any further details and left me guessing. 'As soon as they left my house I started digging further and found an Al-Shabab video has been uploaded on the Internet and in it they name me as a Muslim who is an enemy of Islam and should be eliminated. 'They name a few others in their video message and encourage people to resort to using knives to behead people like me. I spend some time today to verify the threat and it was confirmed to me that it was this video that had spurred our security services to action.'

"Intervention: Mr Straw, the former home secretary, said radical Muslims must accept the UK's values . Schools with large numbers of Muslim pupils must respect British values, former home secretary Jack Straw said yesterday. He spoke as a Muslim MP said a radical ‘Trojan Horse’ plot to take over state schools was operating in Birmingham. Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, claimed a ‘small group of individuals’ was trying to change the ethos of schools by stealth. It was also claimed that roving 'morality squads' have been instituted at the affected schools, and would censor talk of non-Muslim festivals and smash pupils' Easter eggs. Mr Straw said more and more schools were mostly or entirely comprised of Muslim pupils, adding: ‘We have to accept and the schools with a majority of Muslim parents have to accept – as they do if they are Hindu, Sikh, Jewish or Christian – that we also live within the United Kingdom. ‘Alongside values which are religiously based, there has to understanding that this is the UK and there is a set of values – some of which I would say are Christian based – which permeate our sense of citizenship.’ Segregating boys and girls at school was not acceptable if done ‘as a matter of policy’, Mr Straw said during an interview on BBC Radio Four’s Today programme. He went on: ‘There is a real distinction between people who are devout and a very small minority who are extremist and verging into militant extremism and to justifying violence. Under investigation: Park View school, pictured above, is being investigated over the plot - which headteachers fear could spread . ‘What isn’t acceptable – and this affects only a tiny minority, but we’ve got to spell it out to them – are those who proselytise Islam in an exclusive way and claim that those who are not of the Muslim faith are infidel and have fewer rights, and argue that women are inferior and ought to have fewer chances in society than men.’ Mr Straw's words came as a mother of one of the pupils, who did . not wish to be named for fear of reprisals, claimed groups of pupils . were confiscating toys and chocolate from younger children - and accused . teachers of turning a blind eye. According to the Daily Express, the mother said: 'Older boys are going round in these morality squads telling off girls if they do not wear veils. Lindsey Clark, former head of Park View, resigned this month after being reduced to a 'figurehead' with no real control over her school, a Department for Education probe found . 'My daughter tried to bring in an Easter egg for a friend and one boy grabbed it and smashed it against a wall. 'All talk of Christmas and other non-Muslim festivals is banned. The teachers turn a blind eye to it.' A . spokesman for Birmingham City Council refused to comment on the . allegations, but indicated that if bullying had taken place, . disciplining pupils was a matter for individual schools. Speaking on Today earlier, local MP Mr Mahmood said he believed members of a Wahabit Salafist group were trying to impose their views on the majority of Muslims in Birmingham. 'Ringleader': Tahir Alam has denied involvement in the 'Trojan Horse' plot . ‘Governors have been appointed by a particular individual who has brought a number of his friends in as head teachers, changing the ethos of the whole school predominantly by stealth,’ he said. He warned that pupils could be radicalised, adding: ‘This is a significant issue which we are storing up for the future in terms of the mainstream Muslim community and safety and security for all of us. ‘They’ll be detaching these young people from their parents and towards them. I’m not saying this is at that stage now but this is where it will end up.’ The warnings came as Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, took charge of the watchdog’s probe into the so-called Trojan Horse plot to oust heads and governors and run schools according to strict Islamic principles. Another inquiry is being conducted by former anti-terrorism police chief Peter Clarke, who was appointed by Education Secretary Michael Gove. At least five Birmingham schools face being put into special measures, while a sixth has already been failed. Tahir Alam, the plot’s alleged ringleader, denies involvement. Talha Ahmad, of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: ‘[Mr Straw] talks about accepting that Britain has a set of values. I don’t know of any decent Muslim who would disagree with that.’","Former home secretary said that extremists must accept the UK's values .

"A huge planet ten times larger than Earth may be orbiting the sun at the edge of our solar system. Researchers have discovered a dwarf planet called 2012 VP113, along with up to 900 other objects, are orbiting in a similar formation. This suggests that a larger planet, dubbed a Super Earth because of its size, may be creating a shepherding effect pulling these objects around with it. These are the discovery images of 2012 VP113. Three images of the night sky, each taken about two hours apart, were combined into one. The first image was artificially coloured red, second green, and third blue. 2012 VP113 moved between each image as seen by the red, green and blue dots . The observable solar system is divided . into three distinct regions including the rocky terrestrial planets such . as Earth, the gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter, and the icy Kuiper . Belt objects - beyond which lies the Oort cloud. There are three theories for how the inner Oort cloud could have formed. One is a rogue planet could have been tossed out of the giant planet . region and perturbed objects out of the Kuiper Belt on its way. This . could have been ejected or still be in the distant solar system today. The . second claims a close stellar encounter could put objects into the inner . Oort cloud region, while the third theory suggests inner Oort cloud objects are extra-solar planets captured by other stars that were near our sun in . its birth cluster. The total population of the inner Oort cloud is likely bigger than that of the Kuiper Belt and main asteroid belt. 2012 VP113 was first observed in November 2012 and announced earlier today. It is the most distant dwarf planet to be found orbiting our sun. It is approximately 280 miles wide (450km) and orbits beyond the comet-rich Kuiper Belt in a region at the very edge of the system called the Oort cloud. 2012 VP113 is around half the diameter of dwarf planet Sedna, discovered a decade ago, and lies 80 times further from the sun than the Earth. The similarity in the orbits for Sedna and 2012 VP113 points to an as yet undiscovered 'Super Earth'. The two dwarf planets are among of thousands of objects believed to form the inner Oort cloud and were found to have a similar orbit, suggesting the presence of a planet up to 10 times the size of Earth. Dr Linda Elkins-Tanton, of the Carnegie Institution in the United States, said: ‘This is an extraordinary result that redefines our understanding of our Solar System.’ An orbit diagram for the outer solar system. The sun and terrestrial planets are at the centre. The orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are shown in purple. The Kuiper Belt, including Pluto, is shown by the dotted blue region. Sedna's orbit is shown in orange while 2012 VP113's orbit is shown in red . These images show the discovery of the new inner Oort cloud object 2012 VP113 taken about 2 hours apart on 5 November 2012. Highlighted by the arrow. The motion of 2012 VP113 stands out compared to the steady state background stars and galaxies . The observable solar system is divided into three distinct regions including the rocky terrestrial planets such as Earth, the gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter, and the icy Kuiper Belt objects - beyond which lies the Oort cloud. Dr Scott Sheppard, of the Carnegie Institution, said: ‘The search for these distant inner Oort cloud objects beyond Sedna and 2012 VP113 should continue as they could tell us a lot about how our solar system formed and evolved.' The researchers used a Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the Chilean Andes to discover 2012 VP113. They then used the nearby Magellan telescope to determine its orbit and obtain detailed information about its surface. The dwarf planet 90377 Sedna, artist's illustration pictured, was discovered in 2003. It has a similar orbit to the newly discovered 2012 VP113. The Carnegie study indicates the potential presence of an enormous planet, up to 10 times the size of Earth, is possibly influencing the orbit of these two dwarf planets . From the sky, researchers were able to use DECam to calculate about 900 objects with orbits similar to Sedna and 2012 VP113. ‘Some of these inner Oort cloud objects could rival the size of Mars or even Earth,’ said Dr Sheppard. ‘This is because many of the inner Oort cloud objects are so distant even very large ones would be too faint to detect with current technology,’ continued Dr Sheppard. Both Sedna and 2012 VP113 were found near their closest approach to the Sun but they both have orbits at which point they would be too faint to spot. The findings are published in the journal Nature. Dr Linda Elkins-Tanton, of the Carnegie Institution said: 'This is an extraordinary result that redefines our understanding of our solar system,' stock illustration pictured.

"Brazil got off to a winning start in their World Cup opener against Croatia at Arena de Sao Paulo. Their 3-1 win sets them up perfectly ahead of the tournament they are favourites for, but were they as up to scratch as the scoreline suggests? MATT LAWTON gives his ratings. Star: Neymar shined for Brazil as they beat Croatia in their opening World Cup game . BRAZIL (4-3-2-1) JULIO CESAR: 6 . Didn’t have an enormous amount to do, which is probably the way Scolari likes it for his Toronto FC goalkeeper. DANI ALVES: 5.5 . The Barcelona full-back looked distinctly out-of-sorts at times. A nervous start to say the least. THIAGO SILVA: 6 . Decent in possession, passing the ball more than any other player in that frantic first half. DAVID LUIZ: 6 . A solid, composed start from the Chelsea defender. But at times he Thiago Silva looked stretched. MARCELO: 5.5 . Horrible start and the ignominy of becoming the first Brazilian to score an own goal in a World Cup. Recovered well though. Frustration: Marcelo recovered well after a horrible start with an own goal . PAULINHO: 6 . Some surging runs from midfield and a couple of decent shots. Tried to make things happen. OSCAR: 7.5 . Beat two men before providing the ball from which Neymar scored. Showed lots of ambition even if he did lose the ball too easily at times. Fine performance crowned by the goal of the night to cap Brazil's victory late on. Brazil: Beat two men before providing the ball from which Neymar scored, and showed ambition. LUIZ GUSTAVO: 7 . Brazil’s midfield enforcer struggled to contain Modric and Co at times but passed the ball well. HULK: 6 . His partnership with Neymar is supposed to be key to Brazil’s success but had a relatively quiet game. NEYMAR: 8 . Flashes of brilliance and a goal that sent this stadium into ecstasy. A foolish booking for a clash with Modric aside, he carried the hopes of a nation well. FRED: 6.5 . The one member of Brazil’s starting line-up who plays his football in South America competed well as their centre forward. Winner: Neymar scores the winning goal from the penalty spot against Croatia at the Arena de Sao Paulo . CROATIA (4-2-3-1) PLETIKOSA: 5 . Brilliant save to deny Oscar in the first half but might have been frustrated to concede to Neymar given the pace of the shot. Got a strong hand to Neymar's penalty but will be disappointed to concede Oscar's long-range shot late on. Angry: Pletikosa reacts after allowing a goal from the penalty spot against Neymar which he could have saved . SRNA: 6.5 . Croatia’s captain often had to cope with the pressure of marking Neymar. But kept Hulk quiet when he popped up on that flank. CORLUKA: 7 . A solid display from Croatia’s centre-half, his job often to keep Fred quiet. He did it pretty well. LOVREN: 6.5 . Like his fellow centre-half, the Southampton man stood up well against Brazilian pressure. VRSALJKO: 6 . Had his work cut out when Oscar was running at him. A tough night for the Croatia full-back. MODRIC: 7 . Some electric running from midfield and some super passing and movement. Quality player. Bright spark: Modric had some electric running from midfielder and showed superb passing and movement . RAKITIC: 7 . A cynical foul on Neymar but battled well alongside Modric in that midfield battle zone. Good movement too. PERISIC: 6.5 . Terrific cross should have led to an early goal for Croatia. Certainly kept Marcelo busy and full of running. Battle: Perisic (left) and his terrific cross should have led to an early goal for Croatia but he kept Marcelo (right) busy . KOVACIC: 6 . Chief supplier to Jelavic often had to deal with the close attention of Luiz Gustavo. OLIC: 6 . Bad miss in the seventh miss after super cross from Perisic. But provided the teasing cross that led to Marcelo’s own goal. Allowed Dani Alves too much space though. JELAVIC: 6 . Probably should have done better with the finish that ended up bouncing in off Marcelo but battled well as the lone striker. Chase: Jelavic probably should have done better with the finish that ended up bouncing in off Marcelo but battled well . Man of the match: Neymar. Referee: Yuichi Nishimura (Japan): 4 . Two shocking decisions that had an impact on the game. Wrong over the penalty when Dejan Lovren fouled Fred and soft on the foul on Julio Cesar that denied Croatia a goal late on. Man of the match: Neymar was outstanding for Brazil in their 3-1 win .","Brazil beat Croatia 3-1 thanks to two goals from Neymar and one from Oscar in the 91st minute .
It gets the hosts off to perfect start in Group A ."
"Dr Craig Spencer is in a serious but stable condition as he continues to fight the potentially deadly Ebola virus in a New York hospital. Medics treating Mr Spencer, who was diagnosed with Ebola five days ago after returning from fighting the outbreak in Guinea, say they are doing all they can to bring him back to health. New York health and hospitals corporation president Dr. Ram Raju said: 'This morning I talked to our patient and his doctors and nurses at Bellevue Hospital Center. Lifeline: Dr Craig Spencer (left) is said to be 'looking better' and in a 'serious but stable' condition after receiving a blood transfusion from Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol (right) 'The patient looks better than he looked yesterday, but he remains in serious but stable condition with the expected symptoms of the virus. 'He tolerated the plasma treatment well and had a good night sleep. 'From his first day here, he expressed gratitude with the care he is receiving under the watchful eye of the dedicated, well trained and professional team of ICU physicians and nurses who are exclusively assigned to his care. 'On behalf of our patient, I thank all New Yorkers for their prayers and well wishes. 'The entire HHC family and our expert team at Bellevue are committed to doing all we can to bring this brave, caring doctor back to good health.' On Friday night, the 33-year-old  received a blood donation from aid worker Nancy Writebol, who survived the virus, after tests found they shared the same blood type. It is a move that medics believe could save his life after Ebola survivors Nina Pham, Amber Jay Vinson, Ashoka Mukpo and Dr Nick Sacra were all cured following blood transfusions. Writebol contracted Ebola while working with Christian aid group SIM in Liberia with her husband, who is also a missionary. Dr Spencer, who is currently being treated in a New York hospital after being diagnosed with Ebola, is pictured alongside fiancee Morgan Dixon . They were working with their close friend Dr Kent Brantley, who also contracted the disease and was later cured. Meanwhile, Dr Spencer, is receiving antiviral medication and plasma, after he was admitted to hospital with a 100.3-degree fever on Thursday. The medic arrived in New York on October 17 - six days before he was admitted to hospital. During that time he went bowling in Brooklyn, rode the subway and took a taxi, walked Manhattan's High Line and went to restaurants. He reportedly started feeling ill on Tuesday, but the fever did not develop until Thursday. He promptly called officials at the non-government organisation he worked with, Doctors Without Borders, who then called New York's health department. Emergency health workers rushed to Dr Spencer's apartment on West 147th Street, in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, in full protective gear. He was taken to Bellevue about 1pm and his apartment was sealed off, with biohazard cleaners brought in, it is reported. The revelation that Dr Spencer was allowed to move freely around New York city for days before being taken to hospital prompted New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to implement mandatory quarantines for anyone returning from treating Ebola patients. Kaci Hickox, 33, a Doctors Without Borders nurse, was the first to be put in isolation in a tent in the University Hospital parking lot in Newark. Victim: Dr Spencer is a Doctors Without Borders volunteer who recently returning from aid work in Ebola-stricken Guinea, West Africa . She was forced into isolation on Friday last week after showing a temperature of 101F, though later tested negative for Ebola. She blasted her treatment as 'inhumane' and threatened to sue for release, prompting Cuomo and Christie to soften their policies to allow for home quarantine amid criticism from the White House. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, who is facing a re-election battle next week, has instituted a similar policy despite there being no confirmed cases of Ebola in the state. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines yesterday saying those who had come into contact with the bodily fluids of Ebola patients should stay away from commercial transportation or public gatherings. Hospital: Dr Spencer currently remains in a 'stable' condition at Bellevue Hospital (pictured) in New York . The agency said those who had simply traveled to help fight the disease should only be subject to symptom monitoring, in an attempt to create a unified national response to the disease. However, a U.S. Army commander in Italy said he and his troops returning from Liberia would remain in isolation for 21 days, even though he feels they face no risk and show no symptoms. The Army's chief of staff, Gen. Ray Odierno, directed the 21-day controlled monitoring period for all redeploying soldiers returning from the Ebola fight in West Africa, an Army spokeswoman said. Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said. Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the infected person's bodily fluids. September 16: Dr Craig Spencer flew to Guinea to treat Ebola patients as a member of the French organization Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontiers) October 14: Dr Spencer departed Guinea on a flight to Brussels. He reported no symptoms. October 17: He boarded a flight to the U.S. on Brussels Airlines Flight SN0501. Reported no symptoms.Arrived at JFK and was screened with no symptoms upon arrival. October 21: At 7 AM, he reported fatigue and exhaustion. No fever, vomiting, diarrhea. At around 3:00 PM, Dr Spencer visited The Meatball Shop for 40 minutes. The Meatball Shop is located at 64 Greenwich Avenue. Around 4:30 PM, he visited the High Line. Walked on High Line and stopped at the Blue Bottle Coffee stand (10th Ave & W 16th St) At around 5:30 PM, he got off the High Line at 34th Street and took the 1 train to the 145th Street station. October 22: At around 1:00 PM, Dr Spencer went running along Riverside Drive and Westside Highway. Around 2:00 PM, he went to pick up Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm share at 143rd St and Amsterdam Avenue (Corbin Hill Farm) and picked up a box which he took to his apartment. At around 5:30 PM, Dr Spencer left for The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with two friends. For his arrival at Gutter, he took the A train at 145th Street and transferred at 14th Street and took the L train to Bedford Avenue. Around 8:30 PM, Dr Spencer left The Gutter. For his return trip, he used Uber as his means of transportation. October 23: Around 10:15AM, he first reported a fever. At this point, he called Medecins Sans Frontieres and the New York City Health Department. He was immediately taken to Bellevue by FDNY EMS.

"It looks like Jon Corzine’s love of risk-taking is finally proving to bring him down after his securities fund today filed for bankruptcy protection. Futures brokerage MF Global Holdings filed after a tentative deal with a buyer fell apart, marking a stunning failure for its 64-year-old CEO. His career has taken him to the top echelons of Wall Street as Goldman Sachs CEO, into politics as a U.S. senator and to New Jersey governor. Troubled: Jon Corzine, MF Global Holdings CEO, left, leaves his office in Manhattan, New York, on Monday as it filed for bankruptcy protection . But the MF Global meltdown makes it the biggest U.S. casualty of Europe’s debt crisis, as it pays the price for his risky bets on sovereign debt. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing came after talks to sell a variety of assets to Interactive Brokers Group reportedly broke down earlier on Monday. It also comes one week after MF Global, whose shares plunged 66 per cent last week, reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss. Besides the loss of $186.6million for the fiscal second quarter, investors were spooked when MF Global's debt was downgraded to junk status. The seventh-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history by assets is reminiscent of when Lehman Brothers fell at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008. MF Global traders and counter-parties were left scrambling and confused on Monday, as the fund halted its shares. Risk-taker: His career has taken him to the top echelons of Wall Street as Goldman Sachs CEO, into politics as a U.S. senator and to New Jersey governor . But it did not file for bankruptcy until well after the U.S. markets opened. ‘Ultimately it will have lost all confidence of its investor base,’ said Michael Epstein, a restructuring adviser with CRG Partners. 'Ultimately it will have lost all . confidence of its investor base... in some respects, it's a baby Lehman, in effect' Michael Epstein, restructuring . adviser with CRG Partners . ‘I'm not sure what restructuring it actually does. In some respects, it's a baby Lehman, in effect.’ Three traders wearing MF Global jackets were seen leaving the Chicago Board of Trade prior to the opening of pit trading. Floor sources said they had been turned away after their security access cards were denied. Jeff Carter, an independent futures trader in Chicago, said the impact on the markets should be smaller and nothing like when Lehman failed. Mr Corzine's decision to chase yield by going after European sovereign debt was clearly ill-advised and always seemed much too risky, he said. Money man: Mr Corzine is also a top fundraiser for Barack Obama, helping raise at least $500,000 for the President's re-election campaign since April . MF Global scrambled through the weekend and into Monday to find buyers for all or parts of the company. But at the same time it was hiring restructuring and bankruptcy advisers in case nothing could be done. Mr Corzine was trying to transform it from a brokerage that mainly places customers' trades on exchanges into betting with its own capital. He took over MF Global early last year. It has turned a profit just three times in the past 12 quarters. Mr Corzine is also a top fundraiser for Barack Obama, helping raise at least $500,000 for the President’s re-election campaign since April. MF Global, which filed in New York, has assets of $41.05billion and liabilities of $39.68billion, according to its bankruptcy petition. 'The real question is how many assets will be left to transfer,' said Niamh Alexander, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Bank stocks dropped broadly on Monday . after the bankruptcy filing. Bank of America fell 4.5 per cent and . Citigroup plunged 5.5 per cent.","MF Global Holdings files for bankruptcy protection .

"Warning: Lord Judge, the former Lord Chief Justice, has warned the European Court has too much power . Over-mighty European judges are undermining the power of Parliament to make laws, one of Britain’s most senior judges has warned. Lord Judge, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales until September, delivered an unequivocal message on the actions of the Court of Human Rights: ‘Stop here.’ His remarks will give encouragement to Tory Ministers seeking to rein in abuse of human rights laws by criminals, terror suspects and illegal immigrants. They come as the President of the European court, Judge Dean Spielmann warned Britain's ban on prisoner voting is a breach of international law. Earlier this month, Prime Minister David Cameron called for the court's powers to be restricted. He said Britain 'damned well shouldn't' be forced by European . judges to give prisoners the vote if Parliament decides they should be . barred from elections. Judge Spielmann warned any attempt by Britain to pull away from the European Convention on Human Rights could set the UK on a path to leaving the EU altogether. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Lord Judge, said: 'The . most fundamental principle of our unwritten constitution is . parliamentary sovereignty. 'Our . elected representatives have ultimate sovereignty not only over our own . unelected judges but in my view over the unelected judges of any other . jurisdiction, including Europe, unless we choose to give them . sovereignty. 'My very strong belief is that this issue now needs to be resolved by Parliament,' he said. 'This is a court which is not answerable to anybody,' he added. 'If it's right, it can't be overruled by anybody. Risk: His remarks come as Judge Dean Spielmann, President of the European court (pictured), warned that Britain's ban on prisoner voting could risk the country having to leave the EU altogether . 'I genuinely don't think that a body of judges - however distinguished - should have that sort of power.' Lord Judge, who declared himself a . supporter of the European Convention on Human Rights, said the court's . claims have implications for every EU nation, not just the UK. He said: 'His (Judge Spielmann's) view means . that the court in Europe is entitled to tell every country in Europe how . it should organise itself. 'He . refers to it as a living instrument. Of course the convention isn't a . dead instrument, but it means that legislation can be made by judges on . all sorts of societal issues - binding legislation - and if that's the . position there is a very serious problem with sovereignty. 'It's not a UK problem, the sovereignty issue affects every single country in Europe.' He added: 'It is time for us to recognise that it is a very important time. My own view is: stop here.' Judge Spielmann, however, insisted that the UK should not defy the court's ruling on prisoner voting rights. 'This would be clearly inconsistent with the international law obligations of the United Kingdom and also the obligations under the convention,' he told the Today programme. He said that if Britain sought to pull out of the convention - as some Tory MPs are demanding - it would mean leaving the Council of Europe, the body which created the European Court of Human Rights, and ultimately the EU. 'I cannot see how the United Kingdom could remain a member of the Council of Europe while at the same time withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights,' he said. Prime Minister David Cameron said there is no chance of prisoners getting the vote during this Government . 'All the members of the European Union are also members of the Council of Europe. I can hardly see how a member of the European Union could withdraw from the Council of Europe. I see a problem there. 'I think from a political perspective it might be very difficult to stay in the European Union.' In a strongly-worded attack on interference from Strasbourg, Mr Cameron called for the European Court of Human Rights to have its wings clipped earlier this month. The defiant remarks put the government on a collision course with judges who have ruled that the Britain's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights. In February last year the Commons called . for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to . 22, despite repeated warnings from Strasbourg. Mr Cameron said: 'If Parliament decides that prisoners should not get the vote then I think they damn well shouldn't.' He added: 'It should be a national decision taken in our Parliament.' The PM said the court's powers must be restricted, telling workers 'we need to clip its wings'. The prisoner voting row has been . running since 2005, when Strasbourg judges ordered Britain to give the . vote to convicted prisoners, who have historically been considered to . have removed themselves from the electorate. Despite . overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the Commons, the . European judges have continued to repeat their instructions. In 2010 Mr Cameron said it makes him 'physically ill' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison. And . in October last year he added: 'No one should be under any doubt - . prisoners are not getting  the vote under this government.'","Former Lord Chief Justice said European court is threatening to undermine the sovereignty of Parliament .

"Billy Knott regrets the way things ended at Chelsea, ditched following a serious breach of discipline aged just 17. He missed the victorious conclusion to their FA Youth Cup campaign and left behind his closest friends, some of whom were later involved in the infamous smoke grenade incident which forced an evacuation of the training ground. His misdemeanour was deemed so serious that a confidentiality agreement stops him or Chelsea from revealing what it was. The teenager fell out of love with the game and could not even bear to watch football on television. Billy Knott (left) says he has rediscovered his love for football since moving to Bradford City . But Knott has come a long way in five years. On Saturday he returns to Stamford Bridge as Bradford City’s biggest hope of upsetting the Premier League leaders. Indeed, the Bantams would not be here if it wasn’t for his three goals in the third round against Millwall. The 22-year-old has matured since the days of being depicted as a teen tearaway. Knott is returning to West London as a man. ‘I do regret it. It was me in the wrong and I messed stuff up,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I could have learnt a whole lot more. I was young and naive. I always had belief in myself as a player, but you need more than that. ‘Looking back, I would take so much more on board, because these players are the best in the world and I was training with them. ‘The likes of Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard and John Terry, they get it right every single day. They enjoy it every day as well. That’s the big thing — these guys have been at the top for so long yet love coming in to train. That’s the key thing, you’ve got to love what you do to be the best.’ Knott scored a hat-trick as the Bantams beat Millwall in their FA Cup third round replay . Knott signed for Sunderland following his release from Chelsea — where he had captained the junior side and won England youth honours — but he was already on a second chance despite his tender years. He did well on Wearside and was rated by the management. Still, though, he failed to make a breakthrough and was sent on loan. But Paolo Di Canio arrived in 2013 and took an instant liking to Knott — perhaps it was a shared penchant for spectacular goals — and gave him a top-flight debut at Spurs. The affection was mutual. ‘People say he was crazy, and he was in a way, but I just think it was more passion,’ said the Canvey Island-born attacking midfielder, who has seven goals this season. ‘I think he liked me and he had me in training with the first team and gave me my debut. He would join in the training all the time and be very vocal and hands-on. ‘I loved that time and, on the whole, I enjoyed my time at Sunderland but I knew I wasn’t going to get a chance there. I had gone stale. Knott has played 30 times since moving to Bradford City, scoring seven goals in the process . ‘At a young age you don’t want to be sitting on the bench or playing in the reserves and I needed something new.’ That something was Phil Parkinson and Bradford City. Knott signed a two-year deal in the summer and endeared himself to supporters with a 25-yard rocket as Bradford enjoyed their first victory in 28 years over West Yorkshire rivals Leeds in August. ‘I’m back in love with the game now,’ he said. ‘It was hard not to make it at Chelsea but I’m learning the other side of the game now in League One. My aim is still to play in the Premier League but I think I had to drop down to progress.’ Knott scored twice in the 3-3 draw at Millwall and was on target again in a 4-0 thrashing in the replay. ‘We still had the replay to come but I was watching the fourth-round draw with my fiancée at home and I must admit I cheered when we got Chelsea,’ he said. Knott scores in the 3-3 draw against Millwall in the FA Cup, Bradford won the replay . ‘It was funny though, we went to Yeovil and lost 1-0 last week. We then got on the coach and saw that Chelsea had won 5-0 at Swansea! That was a bit scary. ‘Even with their second XI out they’ll still all be internationals and world-class players.’ Knott’s dad, Steve, has organised a bus for 40 friends and family — including Billy’s mum, Michelle, and younger brother, Sammy — to make the trip from Canvey Island to the capital. Also in the crowd will be grandad Colin and grandma Corinne who have travelled from Malta. ‘My grandad has cancer so it’s special for him to be coming over, it means a lot to me,’ said Knott. ‘There’ll also be a rowdy crowd from Canvey Island who’ll be cheering us on. And I really think we can get a draw and take them back to our place. ‘It’ll be tough, but this is the FA Cup. Why not? We’ve just got to give it everything we’ve got and do ourselves proud.’ This time, Knott wants to leave Stamford Bridge with no regrets.","Chelsea host Bradford City in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday .

"For all the sound-bites to the contrary, the early months of Ronny Deila’s tenure at Celtic had all the hallmarks of a man caught in the wrong movie. If the affable Norwegian was cast as an innocent abroad, his senior players had the air of a band of brothers still loyal to the sheriff who’d just left town. Three championships to the good and the scalp of Barcelona on the sideboard, their resistance to radical change instigated by a man whose very name had prompted a million Google searches was understandable. Ronny Deila found it tough as he begun life at Celtic after leaving his manager's post at Stromsgodset . Whatever’s the former Stromsgodset manager’s script was, few appeared to be reading it. ‘I did (lie awake) a little at the beginning because it is not about pressure, it is about finding answers,’ Deila recalled on Friday. ‘The first two months, the team wasn’t prepared for the Champions League and that was a hard part to go through. ‘And it’s tough to come from Norway. You don’t get any extra (time) when you are Ronny Deila from Stromsgodset in Norway. It is not a big name. ‘If you see the way forward, I have no problem with pressure.But, if I see it is just crowded around me, and I can’t find the way to get out of the problems, then I am worried. ‘It was (crowded) in the beginning. It was too much in a short time and things I couldn’t handle.’ Those dark days — meek surrenders to Legia Warsaw, Maribor and Hamilton — now seem an age ago. Of their last 17 domestic games, Celtic have drawn one and lost one. Deila’s side remains a work in progress but tangible signs of their labours are now visible. By far the most significant victory came against Rangers last weekend. Under pressure to emerge victorious like no manager in Celtic’s history, his late night victory dance – to the strains of Eddie Grant – went viral. Changed days indeed. Leigh Griffiths (right) celebrates with Anthony Stokes after putting Celtic in front against Rangers . ‘It’s not the first time I’ve relaxed in this city,’ he smiled. ‘After a game I go to this restaurant with 15 Norwegians, ten of them from my family. I was dancing with my mother, so the mysterious girl was my mother. ‘It was a day my family will never forget. ‘When you sit back when you are 60 years old and talk about this, you were there and you remember. ‘I don’t mind (social media). ‘I’m a happy boy, I love to be social but I’m a hard-working guy as well and very focused.’ And yet, in a sense, Deila has changed over the past eight months. Call Kris Commons to the stand. For so long a casualty of the break-neck rate of change Deila’s was trying to instigate at the club, the double player of the year winner seemed destined to be ousted at the next available juncture. Somewhere along the line though, a middle ground has been found. Commons, who concurs with Deila’s belief that he was playing within himself previously, agreed to up his workload. Concurrently, Deila learned that not every outfield player needs to be capable of running at the speed of light. ‘I think Ronny’s changed as well as the squad,’ Commons stated. ‘Ronny’s had huge success in Norway and had a philosophy and a set of players he knew inside out. Things are now looking up for Deila and his Scottish Champions . ‘That’s not guaranteed to bring success to a club like Celtic. So not only have we changed – Ronny has changed to get the best out of our group. We are all on the same page now and the last few performances have definitely shown that.’ Accordingly, the air just seems that bit clearer around Lennoxtown these days. It was not always thus. Commons can now admit to resistance to the new methodology in the early weeks. ‘We’d played the same way for probably the last four years,’ he said. ‘Any sort of little change can put you off the tracks. ‘You do start having doubts especially when you’ve been beaten a couple of times. When you get knocked out of the Champions League, you start scratching your head. ‘I don’t just believe the players have changed, I think Ronny and his backroom staff have too.’ Deila also believes everyone on the ship is now pulling in the one direction. Mutiny may not quite have been in the air as his side floundered in the autumn but uncertainty abounded. ‘I have learned a lot from Celtic and from the players,’ said the Norwegian. ‘We have to communicate together and find the right pattern, the right way. ‘I’ve learned the culture in the country and how important it is to win and to develop while winning. ‘I have learned about the game in Scotland. I have also seen that when you get into a new club with bigger stars who earn money, they are the same people you train in Norway and need the same things. ‘You have to have a smile on your face and we have to do this together with evolution and not revolution. Are we on the same page now? Yes. The team is in a good place.’ Captain Scott Brown celebrates the Scottish League Cup victory against Rangers with the fans . It can safely be assumed that Commons played as full a part as anyone. Beaming like a child on Christmas morning on Friday, the midfielder was man enough to admit that some of the demands Deila has made of him and his team-mates were perhaps not so unreasonable after all. ‘Being a No 10 you can get away, especially in the SPFL, probably with being a little bit lazy,’ he admitted. ‘I wouldn’t say I was lazy. I would just say you can probably get away with it. There are certain games where you don’t have to produce your best football. ‘He wasn’t asking me to do things I’m not capable of. At the minute I feel as fit as I have ever been.’ The two-year contract that seemed such a long shot is now documentary proof of Commons winning his manager over and vice versa. ‘He was probably a little bit sceptical of whether I could change the way I am, being 31,’ he added. ‘I think when you have a young kid of 19, 20 you can probably take a few seasons to adapt a player but I’m hoping that I have convinced him that I can do the job.’ What was the turning point? ‘I don’t know, probably not just one thing but hard work, dedication, showing him that I am willing to not so much change my game but adapt to give him what he wants.’ For Commons and his team-mates, the gain has not been without pain. Creatures of habit rarely embrace change. With hindsight, the groans that accompanied the banning of fizzy drinks and chips last year were as inevitable as day following night. But few are complaining now. ‘Since day one, Ronny has come here and wants us to try and play not like a Scottish team, he wanted us to play a Barcelona style, Bayern Munich,’ Commons explained. ‘He’s a real big fan of Pep Guardiola, the way he plays and treats his players. ‘He wants us to be elite athletes. 24 hours a day. That was a big hit for lads who had not done that for four years. But we are going in the right direction now.’ For long enough, Common’s sat-nav seemed set for Bolton. Instead, by belatedly embracing Deila’s words, his foot will be pressed to the floor with Celtic for another two seasons. ‘(I thought) Kris could develop 30 per cent more,’ Deila explained. ‘In the beginning, I didn’t see that kind of improvement from him. That’s why I waited to give him the contract that he wanted. But in the last month he has really bought into it and has been working really hard.’","Ronny Deila found it tough as he begun life at Celtic .

"A yacht carrying around £40million of cocaine headed for the UK has been seized after a dramatic chase off the Caribbean island of Martinique. The vessel - SY Hygeia of Halsa - was boarded by French customs and two men from Jersey have been arrested after officers discovered around 250kg of the Class A drug. It followed an investigation involving the Metropolitan Police, their French counterparts and officials from the National Crime Agency (NCA). The SY Hygeia of Halsa (pictured) was intercepted as it began a transatlantic crossing and found to be carrying cocaine with a street value of around £40 million . Two men from Jersey, aged 57 and 42, were arrested and could face prosecution by the French authorities . They had been following a London-based organised crime group, with connections to the Caribbean, suspected of being involved in the large-scale importation of class A drugs. Officers accosted the UK-registered ship  off the island of Martinique on Monday as it began a transatlantic crossing. Two men, aged 57 and 42, were arrested and now face possible prosecution by the French authorities. Hank Cole, the NCA's head of international operations, said: 'Together we have stopped a huge consignment of cocaine close to source. 'We have no doubt that without this intervention the drugs would have ended up on the streets of the UK where, after being cut, they would have had a likely potential value of between £30-40 million. The haul of cocaine - around 250kg - which was discovered by French customs on board the vessel on Monday . 'Our investigation into the organised crime network involved in this attempt continues.' Detective Superintendent Neil Thompson said: 'It is clear that the drugs recovered would have been distributed throughout the streets of London and beyond, generating further criminality and fuelling gang activity. 'If you deal in drugs in any scale we will find you, we will arrest you, and you will face the consequences of your actions.' This is the second significant seizure of Class A drugs on a sailing vessel destined for the UK in recent weeks. Two months ago, around a tonne of cocaine was seized by the Irish Naval Service acting on information supplied by the NCA.

"Ben Westwood, 33, reached speeds of more than twice the national limit as he fled from a police helicopter . A getaway driver hit speeds of up to 180mph as he attempted to flee from police – and is thought to be the fastest driver ever prosecuted in the UK. Ben Westwood, 33,  almost outran a police helicopter, which recorded sparks and flames coming from the underside of the stolen and modified Audi RS5, a court heard. Westwood approached the car’s 200mph top speed during the 65-mile chase on the M6. Officers had pursued him after they spotted his gang trying to rob a cash machine in Penn, West Midlands, on January 13. The £85,000 vehicle was found abandoned in Wolverhampton. Westwood was caught nearby. Officers linked the car, which has a Lamborghini engine and is one of only two in the country, to 15 smash-and-grab raids across the Midlands between August 2011 and January that netted over £50,000. Westwood, of Wednesfield, was found guilty of dangerous driving and conspiracy to burgle and to steal at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Monday and will be sentenced on August 23. CCTV footage of the audacious escape attempt showed sparks and flames coming from the underside and rear of the white Audi RS5 as Westwood  weaved precariously in and out of traffic. At one stage Westwood drove in the wrong . direction down a motorway slip road at 70mph towards a police car that . was forced to veer out of the way. He was finally caught hiding in a flat near where he dumped the car an hour later. Officers . seized the vehicle - which is one of only two in the country - and it . was then linked to 15 similar smash and grab raids covering four . different counties between August 2011 and January this year. During . the trial, it emerged that Westwood attempted to disguise the car by . giving it false plates and respraying it from white to silver and then . to black. Stefan . Kolodynski, prosecuting, told the court Westwood sped away after . officers boxed in a white Ford Transit van which was also used in the . raid. The luxury RS5 Audi saloon matched a vehicle stolen in a car key burglary in Stourport, Worcester, overnight on August 3, 2011 . Westwood managed to flee with another man in the Audi sports car but was pursued by a BMW West Midlands Police car and the force helicopter towards the M6 motorway. He drove the stolen car on the northbound carriageway before taking an exit and doubling back on the southbound carriageway. Mr Kolodynski said: 'Despite the BMW being a powerful car, it was absolutely no match for the Audi. 'It was driven for over an hour before it eventually stopped. The driving was dangerous. 'During the chase it almost outran a police helicopter as it reached speeds of nearing 180mph.' The Audi had its headlights switched off as it cut through small town roads and even passed Westwood’s house, before being dumped nearby. Westwood was caught hiding in a flat in Wolverhampton after the 65 mile high speed chase. When officers examined the car they discovered it had clocked up 1,500 miles since it was stolen. Today . it emerged Westwood was Britain’s fastest getaway driver - beating the . previous record of a motorist being caught travelling at 172mph. The . court heard officers saw Westwood’s stolen Audi parked in the vicinity . of a string of raids in Staffordshire, West Midlands and Shropshire. CCTV footage of the petrol station raid on January 13 - officers caught Westwood after swooping on the gang during the bungled robbery . Another CCTV still from the raid at the petrol station.

This CCTV image shows a member of Westwood's gang clambering over the counter at the petrol station . The luxury saloon matched a vehicle stolen in a car key burglary in Stourport, Worcs., overnight on August 3, 2011. The court heard the car had a Lamborghini engine, a specially designed panoramic glass roof, racing car brakes and a top speed of 200mph. Four other men who were also arrested in connection with the raid admitted conspiracy to steal and will be sentenced later this month. Westwood was jailed in 2007 for four-and-a-half years for being part of a gang who stole a fleet of luxury cars by pinching the keys from people’s homes. A spokesman West Midlands Police said: 'Westwood is a significant target for us to take out of circulation. 'The level of criminality he has been convicted of is of significance not just to the West Midlands and Staffordshire but to the whole region. 'The Audi was specifically stolen because it could out run police cars. 'The offences we have been able to prove are probably just the tip of the iceberg of the true number of those that this car was involved in.' Westwood was remanded into custody and will be sentenced on August 23.","Officers caught Ben Westwood as he tried to flee from bungled .

"Celtic have confirmed Norwegian Ronny Deila as their new manager. The 38-year-old arrived in Glasgow with Chief Executive Peter Lawwell on Thursday night and has signed a 12-month rolling contract to become Neil Lennon’s successor. And following 48 hours of negotiations with Norwegian champions Stromsgodset over compensation Deila was unveiled as the club’s 18th manager at a Parkhead press conference on Friday afternoon.

After . talks with Henrik Larsson, Roy Keane and Stevie Clarke, however, the . club’s powerbrokers have opted for the man who led Stromsgodset to their . first title in 43 years. It’s . believed Celtic have agreed to pay around £300,000 in compensation to . secure their man and former Scotland and Celtic midfielder John Collins . is expected to to be his assistant manager. 'It . is a magnificent honour to be named the new Manager of Celtic,' said . Deila, 'one of the world’s great football clubs and a club I have such . enormous respect for.  I will treasure this opportunity and will give . everything I have to achieve success for Celtic and our wonderful fans. 'I . know what I want for Celtic and our supporters and that is the best of . everything, it is what our fans deserve. I want to deliver the best . attacking, exciting and entertaining football we can play, for the . players to give their best every time they take to the field of and of . course I want my players to work with me to achieve the best results . possible and bring trophies to Celtic.

He is a highly regarded individual . and a man who we are confident will bring great success to Celtic.  He . is a forward thinking coach and manager with a progressive approach. The Celtic Board will support Ronny fully and in every way and we look . forward to working with him.' Chief . Executive Peter Lawwell secured his man after flying to Norway on . Thursday and said: 'We believe Ronny will prove to be a fresh and . dynamic new manager and someone who will give us a bright and energetic . way forward for Celtic.' Success: Deila coached Stromsgodset to their first Norwegian title in 43 years in 2013 . Big job: Deila (left) will replace Neil Lennon at Celtic after the Northern Irishman quit . Going back? Former Celtic player John Collins has been linked with a return to the club as assistant manager . 'Knowing . that he was so highly rated across Europe, Ronny was one of the first . candidates we considered as Manager and having discussed the opportunity . with him at length, we are convinced he has the talent and the . determination to deliver very positive results for the Club and our . supporters. 'Ronny . likes to play attacking, winning football, the Celtic way, something I . know our supporters will endorse.   As the new season begins, I am sure . our fans will get right behind Ronny and the players once again as we . aim to bring success to Celtic and continue to deliver a Club they can . be proud of.' Deila was recommended to Celtic by contacts at English champions Manchester City and, speaking before the appointment was confirmed, predecessor Neil Lennon said: 'He came highly recommended, he's highly thought of. 'I don't know if it's confirmed with Celtic yet, but I know from contacts in the game that he is well respected as a coach. No go: Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane asked not to be considered for the Celtic job . 'We recruited Stefan Johansen from Stromsgodset, so we were aware of his work. It'll be interesting to see if Ronny gets the job.' Lennon was 'surprised and a little bit disappointed' that former Celtic and Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane had asked not to be considered for the Parkhead post. The Irishman opted to stay on as Republic of Ireland assistant to Martin O'Neill and has has been linked with the number two job at Aston Villa under Paul Lambert. Backing: Predecessor Neil Lennon has backed Deila's credentials after he came highly recommended . 'I think he's ready for it,' said the Northern Irishman.

"Former Chelsea trainee Billy Knott was part of the Bradford City side which triumphed at Stamford Bridge. He left the club as a 17-year-old following a serious breach of discipline. Five years on and Knott has rebuilt his career and is now one of the stars of Phil Parkinson's side, playing a key role during their shock 4-2 victory in Saturday's FA Cup fourth round tie. Here, the Canvey Island-born midfielder reflects on his weekend with Sportsmail. Billy Knott (bottom) celebrates with team-mate Andy Halliday after beating Chelsea in the FA Cup . 'No-one felt any pressure really and we went there to enjoy the day - that was always the message. 'But at the same time we had a game-plan and intended to stick to it. Even at 2-0 down I thought we were playing well. 'At that point I was actually still really enjoying the game because I thought we were doing okay, we certainly weren't falling to pieces. 'When we got to 2-1 before half-time it was huge though. We came out for the second half full of belief and when we equalised it was just incredible, although it was deserved. 'I went off at 2-2 but it was always going to be the way that the substitutes played a massive part, and they won us the game. Knott (centre) tussles for the ball with Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma at Stamford Bridge . Knott and his dad show off his signed shirt from Chelsea captain John Terry following Bradford's 4-2 win . 'I was kicking every ball after that. I mean, winning at Chelsea just doesn't happen. What we achieved is unbelievable. But I honestly think we deserved to win. 'At the same time, they were excellent. The way they move the ball makes it so hard. You don't tackle, you just end up trying to block passes or cut off the space, they are so good. 'When Cesc Fabregas came on I was a bit star-struck, he's one of my idols. 'To win against that side – with so many world-class players – is probably the biggest achievement of our careers. 'It's amazing for the lads, the gaffer, the club and the fans. 'Mourinho was brilliant afterwards. He came in the dressing-room and shook everyone's hand. He told us to make sure we enjoy the day and wished us luck in the next round. It was really classy and the lads loved it. Former Chelsea trainee Knott is sent crashing to the ground after a challenge from John Obi Mikel (left) Knott admits he was star-struck when his 'idol' Cesc Fabregas entered the action as a substitute . 'We were singing and dancing and the chairman sent some champagne down – the scenes were incredible. 'John Terry gave me his signed shirt and my dad is going to frame that with my shirt and the programme and scarf and match ticket to put up in the house. 'I went back to Canvey Island on the bus with all my friends and family afterwards – that was some journey. It was unreal. My dad, Steve, had organised it and they had some day. 'We went out on Saturday night to our local pubs, the Windjammer and Oyster Bay. I didn't have to buy a drink all night!

She's a Chelsea fan though so she's the only one who hasn't enjoyed it as much as everyone else, but my dad is a fully signed up Bradford fan. 'We just can't wait for the draw now. It was so special going back to Chelsea. A lot has been made of me leaving there but that is in the past and Saturday was amazing, the best day of my career.

"Frank Lampard more than anyone else - more than John Terry even - symbolises everything that’s been positive about Chelsea in the Roman Abramovich era. In fact, he’s the man who really should have been Chelsea captain through all their years of success since the Russian billions arrived. Giving the armband to a professional like Lampard would have improved the club’s image and reputation dramatically. Model professional: Frank Lampard has been a fantastic servant for Chelsea and should have been handed the captain's armband at Stamford Bridge instead of John Terry . Born winner: Lampard has swept the board in terms of trophies, the crowning glory being the 2012 Champions League win over Bayern Munich . Time to go: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has let Lampard hold talks with New York City FC in the MLS . He’s played his heart out on the pitch, and he’s been brilliant as a club ambassador off it. Anyone who has seen Lampard devote time to fans after games will know exactly what I’m talking about. You might think it’s the least he should be doing given the amount he earns, but he does it, and he does it with a sincerity few others can match. On the field he doesn’t seem to have given any manager a problem, even when Jose Mourinho wasn’t picking him last season, he was ready to give everything when called on. Chosen one: John Terry has captained Chelsea for many years but has a tarnished reputation . Top trio: Lampard, Mourinho and Terry celebrate with the Premier League trophy back in 2005 . On the training ground there is no better man to set the example than Lampard. He has enjoyed a very successful career thanks mainly to the hours and hours of work he has put in on the training ground. His decision to go to the MLS in America is a huge loss for Chelsea. It’s widely believed what made Roy Hodgson’s mind up about taking Lampard to this World Cup is his positive influence in the dressing room. They will miss that at Stamford Bridge. Sure, Terry is there, but he’s hardly unblemished off the pitch, and it remains to be seen if the captain can take the weight of responsibility solely on his shoulders without Lampard. First signing: New York City FC announced that David Villa would be their first player when they enter the MLS . Positive influence: Roy Hodgson selected Lampard in his World Cup squad partly for his mentoring of the young players . At the height of the Wayne Bridge scandal, I strongly felt Lampard should have replaced Terry as captain. It would have won Chelsea a lot more friends, that’s for sure. To lose Ashley Cole is one thing – that’s a true winner gone. David Luiz, a big positive in the dressing room has also gone – that will be hard to replace. But to then lose Lampard – a great club man, a terrific player, and a hugely important leader in the squad - in the same summer, is just too careless from Mourinho. If Lampard can exploit the connections his new club New York City has with Manchester City and returns to the Premier League on loan with the Champions next season, it could leave Mourinho looking very stupid. Departing: David Luiz is also set to leave Chelsea and join Paris Saint Germain this summer . How dare Southampton hold Adam Lallana back? This is a player who has given everything for the club: he was one of the best players in League One when they achieved promotion, likewise when they went up from the Championship, and he has improved again to be recognised as one of the elite footballers in the Barclays Premier League. Could this player have done more for the club? No way, he’s given everything since Southampton took him from Bournemouth as a 12-year-old for an initial compensation fee of just £3,000. Southampton will defend their right to ask for a bigger fee for Lallana, who could have joined Juande Ramos’ Spurs for £5m six years ago. Disrespectful: Southampton should allow Adam Lallana to leave for Liverpool given his service to the club . Saints have been the club that turned him into a probable England World Cup player, and they will have to pay Bournemouth 25 per cent of any transfer fee they receive. But if they have turned down a £25m offer from Liverpool, simply because they want to squeeze more money from the deal, then I find that disrespectful to the player. He’s earned his move to a bigger club with bigger wages and Champions League football, after delivering on the field for Southampton. Saints should let the Liverpool deal happen before the World Cup so that the player can focus on Brazil. Isn’t that what Lallana deserves after everything he’s given to Southampton Football Club? World Cup contention: Lallana, seen here playing against Peru at Wembley on Friday, has every chance of starting for England out in Brazil .","Lampard in talks to join new MLS franchise New York City FC .

"A flood of Biblical proportions just like in the story of Noah's Ark may have actually happened, according to the oceanographer who found the Titanic. Acclaimed underwater archaeologist Robert Ballard claims his team of researchers have uncovered evidence that suggests The Great Flood described in the Bible was actually based on real events. Mr Ballard told how he investigated a controversial theory proposed by two scientists from Columbia University that there was a massive flood in the Black Sea region. Scroll down for video . Under sea researcher Robert Ballard (left), who found the Titanic, holds a picture of ancient jugs found off the coast of Israel and lost in a storm around 750 BC. He claims to have found evidence of The Great Flood . Genesis: A mural from the mid-16th century shows God ordering Noah to load two of every animal on to his ark to avoid the imminent Great Flood . In an interview with ABC News, he said around 12,000 years ago much . of the world was covered in ice and the Black Sea had been a freshwater . lake surrounded by farmland. But when the glaciers began to melt during a warming period in the cycle of the Earth's temperature around 5600BC water rushed toward the world's oceans, Mr Ballard said. This, he claimed, caused floods all . around the world and water cascaded through Turkey’s Straits of Bosporus . towards the Black Sea. 'Where I live in Connecticut was ice a . mile above my house, all the way back to the North Pole, about 15 . million kilometers, that's a big ice cube,' he said. 'But then it . started to melt. We're talking about the floods of our living history. The questions is, was there a mother of all floods?' His research follows a 1997 study by William . Ryan and Walter Pitman who, drawing on archaeological . and anthropological evidence, claimed that 'ten cubic miles of water poured . through each day', and that the deluge continued for at least 300 days. A working replica of Noah's Ark built six years ago by Johan Huibers as a testament to his faith in the Bible in Schagen, the Netherlands . The animals coming were two by two: The story of Noah is described in the book of Genesis . Legendary: A manuscript of Noah's Ark from the Nuremburg Bible 1493 . More than 60,000 square miles of land . were flooded, they said, and the lake's level rose by hundreds of feet after . merging with the Mediterranean, triggering mass animal migrations across . Europe. According to their study, the force of the water was two . hundred times that of Niagara Falls, sweeping away everything in its . path. It also transformed the Black Sea from an isolated freshwater lake . surrounded by farmland into a saltwater inlet. The researchers, whose findings have . been backed up by carbon dating and sonar imaging, claimed that the story . of Noah's flood had its origin in this cataclysmic event. Passed down: A 14th Century English manuscript showing Noah's Ark at the end of flood . 'We went in there to look for the flood,' Mr Ballard told ABC News. 'Not just a slow moving, advancing rise of sea level, but a . really big flood that then stayed... The land that went under stayed . under.' The team found an ancient shoreline which Mr Ballard believes is proof such an event did take place. He believes that, by using carbon dating shells found along the shoreline four hundred feet below the surface, it took place around 5,000 BC. 'It probably was a bad day,' he said. 'At some magic moment, it broke through and flooded this place . violently, and a lot of real estate, 150,000 square kilometers of land, . went under.' As the theory goes, the story of the disaster was passed down from generation to generation and eventually inspired the biblical account of Noah. Noah is described in the Bible as a family man, a father of three, who is about to celebrate his 600th birthday. 'In the early chapters of Genesis, . people live 800 years, 700 years, 900 years,' said Rabbi Burt Visotzky, a . professor of Talmud and Rabbinics at the Jewish Theological Seminary in . New York. 'Those are mythic numbers, those are . way too big. We don't quite know what to do with that. So sometimes . those large numbers, I think, also serve to reinforce the mystery of the . text.' 'It probably was a bad day,' he said. 'At some magic moment, it broke through and flooded this place . violently, and a lot of real estate, 150,000 square kilometers of land, . went under.' Robert Ballard . Mr Ballard's team has also found an ancient shipwreck, as well as ancient pottery. Although he does not think he will ever find Noah's Ark, he believes he may find evidence of an ancient community washed away. In the book of Genesis, God despairs of . human corruption and decides to flood the Earth, instructing Noah to . build an ark to save himself, his family and a pair of each animal . species. The Ark is described in the Book of Genesis as 300 cubits long, or approximately 450ft (137m), but despite many rumours and claims of sightings, no scientific evidence of its existence has ever been found. 'The oldest shipwreck that we have discovered so far of that area is . around 500 BC, classical period,' Mr Ballard said. 'But the question is you . just keep searching. It's a matter of statistics.' Mr Ballard, who led the international team that located the wreckage of the Titanic in 1985, does not think he will ever find Noah's Ark. However, Mr Ballard does think . he may find evidence of a people whose entire world was washed away . about 7,000 years ago. He and his team said they plan to return to . Turkey next summer. 'It's foolish to think you will ever find a ship,' Mr Ballard said, . referring to the Ark. 'But can you find people who were living? Can you . find their villages that are underwater now? And the answer is yes.' According to Genesis 8:4, it came to rest 'in the mountains of Ararat'. Experts have agreed that these mountains are to be located in present-day Armenia and eastern Turkey. Many biblical scholars believe the story of Noah and the Ark was inspired by the legendary flood stories of nearby Mesopotamia, in particular 'The Epic of Gilgamesh.' These ancient narratives were already being passed down from one generation to the next, centuries before Noah appeared in the Bible. 'The earlier Mesopotamian stories are very similar where the gods are sending a flood to wipe out humans,' said biblical archaeologist Eric Cline. 'There's one man they choose to survive. He builds a boat and brings on animals and lands on a mountain and lives happily ever after? I would argue that it's the same story.' Catastrophic events of this kind are not unique to the Bible. Some contemporary examples include the 2004 tsunami that wiped out villages on the coasts of 11 countries surrounding the Indian Ocean. There was also Hurricane Katrina, described as the worst hurricane in United States history. Scholars aren't sure if the biblical flood was larger or smaller than these modern day disasters, but they do think the experiences of people in ancient times were similar to our own. 'If you witness a terrible natural disaster, yes, you want a scientific explanation why this has happened,' said Karen Armstrong, author of A History of God. 'But you also need to something that will help you to assuage your grief and anguish and rage. And it is here that myth helps us through that.' Regardless of whether the details of the Noah story are historically accurate, the author believes this story and all the Biblical stories are telling us 'about our predicament in the world now.'",Acclaimed oceanographer Robert Ballard says he has found evidence .
"A Liberal Democrat MP who has questioned the existence of Israel was suspended from the party yesterday. David Ward will have the whip withdrawn until Parliament returns in September after branding Israel an 'apartheid state'. But the punishment - after Mr Ward repeatedly condemned Israel and 'the Jews' more widely - was condemned by Jewish groups as an 'empty gesture' that is 'too little, too late'. Mp for Bradford East David Ward (left) pictured with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (centre) has been suspended over comments questioning the continued existence of the state of Israel . The offensive Tweet was still available to read on David Ward's Twitter feed last night . Lib Dem chief whip Alistair . Carmichael kicked Mr Ward out yesterday over a Tweet in which the . Bradford East MP said: 'Am I wrong or are am I right? At long last the . #Zionists are losing the battle - how long can the #apartheid State of . #Israel last?' That . outburst came after four previous warnings from the party leadership . that he use 'proportionate and precise' language when discussing Israel. Mr . Carmichael said Mr Ward's repeated outbursts had been framed in a way . that has 'caused offence' and made it more difficult for the Lib Dems to . make legitimate criticism of Israel's settlement building in . Palestinian areas. Mr . Ward's difficulties with the party leadership began over a posting made . on his website after signing a memorial book to mark Holocaust Memorial . Day in January. Lib Dem chief whip Alistair . Carmichael said Mr Ward's repeated outbursts had been framed in a way . that has 'caused offence' He . wrote that he was 'saddened that the Jews, who suffered unbelievable . levels of persecution during the Holocaust, could within a few years of . liberation from the death camps be inflicting atrocities on Palestinians . in the new state of Israel and continue to do so on a daily basis'. But despite repeated warnings to tone down his language, Mr Ward refused. Following a meeting with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and his deputy Simon Hughes, Mr Carmichael yesterday wrote to Mr Ward saying: 'We put it to you that your most recent statement - which specifically questions the continuing existence of the State of Israel - is neither proportionate nor precise. 'We considered your explanation to be unconvincing. These interventions cause considerable offence rather than addressing questions of political substance about the plight of the Palestinian people and the right of Israel's citizens to live a life free of violence. Jonathan Arkush, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the suspension is not enough. He said: 'We note that the Liberal Democrats have at last taken some action to address the completely inappropriate and offensive comments that he has made. However, suspension of the whip for just two months when Parliament is not sitting is too little, too late. It is a token and frankly an empty gesture.' Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust said: 'David Ward has never fully apologised for his comments, which deliberately abused the memory of the Holocaust and caused deep pain and offence. 'Although I welcome the withdrawal of the whip, the decision to do so comes months too late and allows Mr Ward to repeat his unacceptable views when Parliament returns in the autumn.'","David Ward will have whip withdrawn until Parliament returns in September .

"They used to hang a banner behind the goal at the Santiago Bernabeu during matches between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid: ‘Wanted: worthy rival for a decent derby’. It was a reference from Real Madrid fans to 14 years of steamrollering their city neighbours in embarrassingly one-sided derbies. Things changed when Diego Simeone turned up. Atletico ended that run of not being able to beat Real in 2013 and they did it in style, winning the Spanish Cup, with Diego Costa and Thibaut Courtois getting the better of Jose Mourinho in practically his last game in charge at the  Bernabeu.

Atletico have already faced Real five times this season and Carlo Ancelotti’s side are yet to come out on top in the derby that has suddenly become one of Europe’s most fiercely contested again. There are just 10 miles between Real Madrid’s stadium and Atletico’s Vicente Calderon. There are also 10 European Cups between the two clubs but that didn’t stop Simeone’s underdogs winning La Liga last season. There was a brief return to the old form book at the Champions League final in Lisbon when Atletico were within seconds of winning only for Sergio Ramos to head in a corner and Real to romp home in extra time. ‘ . Cristiano Ronaldo (right) celebrates with Alvaro Morata after scoring in the Champions League final . Skipper Iker Casillas (centre) and his team-mates celebrate their Champions League final win over Atletico . 'Normal business’, however, has not been restored. Atletico are one of the most difficult sides to beat in Europe and no-one tests Real more. Cristiano Ronaldo and Co, having already overcome Barca this season at the Bernabeu, were beaten by goals from Arda Turan and Tiago either side of a Ronaldo penalty last September when Atletico visited. On Saturday, Madrid will once again be split. Atletico’s stadium was not expected to host too many more derbies with a new ground outside of the city planned to be opened at the end of next season but, with work on it currently stalled, there is a feeling that the old area on the banks of the Manzanares river has some life in it yet. On Saturday, with Simeone conducting the masses, the atmosphere will be as good as a neutral will find anywhere in Spain. Atletico's Diego Godin (centre) is sent off after bringing down Gonzalo Higuain (second left) in  2011 . When they were relegated to the second division in 2000, Atletico Madrid had 20,000 season-ticket holders. At the start of the following season in the second division they had 45,000 season-ticket holders committed to supporting the club’s attempt to win promotion. That passion has always been there and Simone - a former double-winning player at the club - has tapped into it. Atletico just need to make sure the excitement doesn’t get the better of them. They lost their heads against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey last week with Gabi sent off at half-time, Mario Suarez joining him in the second half and coach Simeone and Arda Turan lucky not to pick up reds too. On Saturday they must keep their heads without losing that killer instinct that has seen them become Real’s worst nightmare so far this season.

Turan walks off the field after the Atletico forward is sent off against Barcelona . Managers . It’s Mr Cool and Mr Motivator. Carlo Ancelotti has fared badly against his former Serie A rival since he turned up in Spain. The two contrasting styles will be in evidence again on the touchline. Ancelotti might allow himself a couple of extra chewing gums to help deal with the tension; Simeone will be in emotional overdrive from the first kick. It would be harsh on him to just call it tub-thumping heart-on-the-sleeve stuff however. He has been the shrewd tactician in these matches too smothering Madrid’s play-makers Isco and James Rodriguez. Carlo Ancelotti has yet to see his side win a Madrid derby in five attempts this season . Diego Simeone is tactically astute and knows to get the better of Ancelotti's Real side . Players . There will be no James Rodriguez because of a broken bone in his foot and perhaps more importantly Real Madrid will be without both first-choice central defenders Pepe and Sergio Ramos. There could also be no Marcelo pending a final-hour attempt to over-turn his suspension. What Real do have in their favour is the return of Ronaldo. The birthday boy, who celebrated 30 years this week, has missed the last two games and will be desperate to get back among the goals in what has so far been a disappointing 2015. Atletico Madrid look set to field Mario Mandjukic and Antoine Griezmann in attack at the expense of Fernando Torres, although having scored in the first minute against both Real and Barca this season, Simeone will be tempted to start with El Nino - who has netted twice against the old enemy since his return to the club. Gareth Bale (centre) trains with his Real Madrid team-mates at Valdebebas on Friday . Mario Mandzukic (right) could start up front for Atletico during Saturday's Madrid derby . Tactics . Without Rodriguez in midfield Carlo Ancelotti will revert to a 4-3-3 with Sami Khedira keeping Toni Kroos and Isco company and the BBC front three of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano in attack. Ronaldo has a superb record against Atletico Madrid, scoring 15 goals against them in 19 matches. They will look to suck the home side in and hit them on the counter attack but Atletico are not a team to be pulled where the opposition want them to go. They won’t be fooled into playing high up the pitch against the speed of Bale and Ronaldo. They will stay compact and look to utilise their efficiency from set pieces where captain Diego Godin and Koke will be vital as always. Ronaldo, scoring in November 2011, has netted 15 goals in 19 matches against Real's rivals Atletico . Form/Prediction . Both sides are wobbling. Real have not been the same since they won the World Club Cup. They lost the first league game of the new year against Valencia and then they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atletico. Ronaldo has been given a red card and Gareth Bale has been given abuse by his own supporters for not passing the ball. Atletico are not in a much better state. They were then dumped out of the Copa del Rey by Barcelona losing their nerve in the process. In the meantime Barcelona have gone from strength to strength. That makes it even more vital that both sides win. Prediction: Neither will win. A score draw giving the Catalans who play Sunday against Athletic Bilbao a great chance to take advantage.

"Greater Manchester Fire Service paid out £5,000 in compensation after the man sliced a tendon in his finger on the 'broken' gloves . A fireman who hurt his finger while putting on a glove was awarded £5,000 in compensation. The payout is among £150,000 of settlements reached by one fire service in just three months. Bosses at Greater Manchester Fire Service (GMFS) accepted the glove was 'broken' when the crew member sliced a tendon in his finger on a piece of stray fibre. The anonymous pay-out is one of £150,000 worth of claims given to injured firefighters in just three months. Fire chiefs defended the figures, saying compensation settlements had nearly halved thanks to improvements in equipment and training. And they said payouts for injuries were inevitable because firefighters were willing to take so many risks for the job. Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws show 18 firefighters were awarded compensation by GMFS between April and June this year for injuries dating back as far as 2007. The catalogue of claims ranged from a scald from a broken shower to a burn caused by hot fat. In one case, the service paid out £20,000 after water from a burst hose sent a firefighter flying during a training exercise, knocking him over and seriously injuring his knee. Another got £6,000 after hitting his head getting into his fire engine, while one crew member was hurt by his appliance’s seat. The biggest pay-out involved an employee who hurt his neck and shoulder after being hit by metal sheeting in 2007. The Greater Manchester Fire Service says payouts for injuries were inevitable because firefighters were willing to take so many risks for the job . He had tried to claim £210,000 - and the service paid out £25,005 after agreeing a settlement. In 2010 a crew member fell down an inspection pit because the makeshift bridge above it was not safe - earning a £15,000 payout. And more than £4,000 was paid after a crew member cut their arm on a broken window while trying to rescued a trapped householder during the Cumbria floods. A total of 18 other compensation claims from staff are currently still being dealt with. Assistant Chief Fire Officer Peter O’Reilly said: 'There has been a 45 per cent reduction in the number of firefighter injuries since 2006 - however we are an emergency service and our crews will take highly calculated risks to save lives and property.' Union chiefs said compensation provided a vital safety net for firefighters hurt at work - and encouraged the service to provide better equipment and training. Kevin Brown, from the Fire Brigades Union, said: “We have worked as a union with the employers to reduce these cases. 'We’d much rather our members didn’t have to receive any compensation at all.'","Claimed he sliced tendon on stray fibre .

"Celtic hope to have Stromsgodset coach Ronny Deila in place as their new manager by the end of the week. The Norwegian champions are digging in their heels over compensation for the man hailed in his homeland as his the new Jurgen Klopp. However, Deila’s agent Tore Pedersen was in Glasgow to agree terms on Wednesday and Celtic hope that the deal can be concluded quickly. To the rescue: Is Ronny Deila the man to save Celtic? Incoming: Stromgodset coach Deila could be appointed this week . That will obviously depend on a compromise being reached with his current club as the 38-year-old’s reward for leading Stromsgodset to their first title in 43 years was a new contract until 2016. Speaking after Stromsgodset crashed out of the Norwegian Cup following a 4-2 extra-time defeat in Tromsdalen, a cagey Deila gave little away, insisting: ‘It’s just speculation. And there will always be speculation around people who are doing well. ‘Of course I am flattered. It’s great to be linked to a club like Celtic. But I’ve been in this game for a long time, and nothing is secure yet.’ Asked how he will respond if Celtic formally offer him the job, Deila added: ‘That’s speculation.’ Big character: Deila has been likened to Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp who is well admired . Deila stepped into the manager’s chair in 2008 after playing for the club and has improved the league position every year since, culminating in a cup win four years ago and Stromsgodset’s first championship win since 1970. He signed a new deal in the winter after travelling abroad on a training trip to visit Klopp in Dortmund. Sportsmail understands he was originally considered as a potential replacement for Johan Mjallby as Celtic No 2 under Neil Lennon. Asked if he had paid any visits to Parkhead, however, he said: ‘No, I was never there. I have just watched a game there once.’ Deila is credited with developing Stefan Johansen, the midfielder who joined Celtic in a £1.5million deal last January, and building a formidable team on a fraction of rivals Rosenborg’s budget. Rejection: Roy Keane reportedly turned down the job . Linked: Steve Clarke was also believed to be in the running . Henrik Larsson, Roy Keane and Steve Clarke have all been spoken to by Parkhead powerbrokers over the role vacated by Lennon a fortnight ago. But Parkhead sources have confirmed Deila is now the frontrunner and chief executive Peter Lawwell hopes to make an announcement on the new man in the coming days. ‘There’s nothing more we can say, we are still working on it,’ said Lawwell. ‘But hopefully we can over the next few days or at least during the next week, have something to say. ‘We talk to more people and hopefully we will get the right man soon.’ Norwegian media reports say Lawwell contacted Stromsgodset to express an interest in speaking to Deila on Tuesday night. Compensation now looks to be the greatest obstacle to agreement. ‘It’s always fun when there is speculation in the media about the players and coaches of Stromsgodset,’ said the Norwegian club’s chief executive Erik Espeseth. ‘It shows that we have arrived on the map of Europe. On behalf of the club, it is flattering. ‘But we have no comments in relation to any requests for our players or coaches. ‘Generally speaking, we think is it exciting and nice that they are being linked with major clubs in Europe. It says something that we have built the club over time.’ Rosenborg and Swedish club Malmo have been linked with moves for the talented coach in the recent past, but Stromsgodset chairman Tom Saxegaard refused to comment, saying: ‘You know for sure that we cannot comment on rumours.’ Outgoing: Neil Lennon stepped down as Celtic boss at the end of last season .","Ronny Deila rejects speculation linking him with Celtic job .

"Ed Miliband is facing a Labour revolt over secret plans for a ‘nanny state’ crackdown on drinking, smoking and junk food. Leaked documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday show the Labour leader is proposing sweeping new laws to force people to live healthier lives if he wins next year’s General Election. They include banning cheap beer and wine, flying in the face of Mr Miliband’s campaign to cut the cost of living. And it will mean tough new curbs on food and drinks firms, television and sport – which would lose £300 million from the outlawing of alcohol sponsorship. Labour leader Ed Miliband is working on the the plan which will dramatically change society by restricting what can be sold in shops . The Labour leader believes his policies will be a vote-winner in an increasingly health-conscious nation. But they have sparked a backlash from Labour moderates led by Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, tipped as Mr Miliband’s successor. Supporters of Blairite Mr Umunna say the plans risk being seen as ‘anti business and interventionist’ – and reinforce Mr Miliband’s Left wing ‘Red Ed’ image. Ed Miliband wants half of the adult population to take regular exercise within ten years of him becoming Prime Minister . The row follows a similar internal Labour dispute over plans by Mr Miliband to cap energy prices and rents. ‘Issuing diktats on eating and drinking and strangling supermarkets and drinks companies with more regulations is a return to the failed Old Labour approach,’ said one Labour MP. ‘It is no more realistic than thinking you can control people’s gas and electricity bills or how much rent they pay. ‘We need to show business we are on their side – and stop meddling in every aspect of people’s lives.’ The Labour health blueprint includes: . The plans were drawn up by Andy Burnham. Sources close to the health spokesman say Mr Miliband has vowed to make them a key part of Labour’s manifesto.  Meanwhile, Mr Burnham is said to regard it as a vital way of advancing his own Labour leadership ambitions. The proposals were backed by Mr Miliband at a meeting with senior Shadow Cabinet Ministers, including Ed Balls, Harriet Harman, Douglas Alexander and Tristram Hunt. They are members of one of three secret policy-making groups set up by Mr Miliband to bypass the Party’s official National Policy Forum, which includes union leaders, activists and MPs. Graphic . Details of the legally enforced health shake-up are revealed in a report to the ‘society’ sub group of the Shadow Cabinet. To stop union leaders and activists finding out about the plans, Mr Miliband gave orders that no minutes were kept. But a copy of the proposals obtained by this newspaper show they would lead to one of the most radical attempts in history to use the law to change lifestyles. Among the most far-reaching aspect of the Labour plans is a legal crusade to cut ‘boozing’. The Labour document says: ‘Up to  35 per cent of all A&E attendances and ambulance costs may be alcohol related and up to 70 per cent at weekend peak times.’ Sports fans and participants would be the first to feel the effects. It declares: ‘The promotion of alcohol through the sponsorship of sport should be phased out during the course of the [five year] Parliament.’ A ban on all sponsorship by drinks companies would cost the sporting world £300 million a year, of which £50 million goes to grassroots activities. A total of 11 Premiership teams receive money from drinks companies. The Labour plan would also spell the end for Budweiser’s sponsorship of the FA Cup, Heineken’s branding  of the European Cup rugby tournament and Crabbie’s support of the Grand National. The plan is being opposed moderates in Mr Miliband's shadow cabinet such as Chuka Umunna, who is afraid Red Ed's left-wing image will hurt the party in the election . David Cameron scrapped plans last year for a 40p minimum unit price for alcohol after claims that it would hit the poor hardest. But Mr Miliband will force it through if he becomes Prime Minister. The leaked Labour paper says ‘minimum unit pricing or an alternative’ is needed ‘to reduce the availability of high alcohol, low price “booze” used for “pre-loading’’’– or drinking cheap store-bought alcohol at home before a night on the town. Mr Miliband will also decide which shelves are used to display certain products at the supermarket, with discounted alcohol moved to the back of stores. ‘The positioning of alcohol retail space in supermarkets should be regulated, for example, being  limited to a single defined area physically distant from the doors,’  it says. Town hall and police chiefs would be given new powers to force pubs to pay a levy to cover the cost of policing town centres where there is disorder caused by drunks. They would also get extra powers to remove licences from landlords accused of running unruly pubs. Similar sweeping measures, backed by law, are planned to make Britain ‘smoke free’, with a target or reducing the number of adults who smoke to one in ten of the population in  a decade. Currently about 22 per cent of adult men and 19 per cent of women are smokers. ‘Helping them quit is not only good for their health but their finances too: if they smoke 20 a day quitting puts over £2,000 back in their pockets each year,’ the document states . Mr Miliband’s ‘goal is that children born in 2015 will become the first smoke-free generation for hundreds of years.’ To make Britain ‘smoke free’ he would ban smoking in cars with children and introduce plain standardised cigarette packets. And Mr Miliband would treat the tobacco industry as a pariah, refusing to have any contact with it. ‘Labour should become the country’s first “tobacco-free” political party, rejecting sponsorship or donations from the tobacco industry or their front organisations,’ says the document. Mr Miliband’s plan to tackle the rise in obesity, in particular among the young, could lead to some well-known products, including breakfast cereals with a high sugar content, being banned, with further  curbs on television adverts. Labour’s anti-obesity plan states: ‘In England, 62 per cent of adults and 28 per cent of children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese, costing the NHS more than £5 billion a year.’ It calls . for ‘regulations to limit the levels of fat, salt and sugar in products . marketed substantially to  children. Food marketed to children via . television should also be curbed by a 9pm watershed [for such . products].’ And Mr Miliband would stop supermarkets displaying sweets near tills to stop children pestering their parents into buying them. ‘They should not be permitted to stock confectionery and other unhealthy foods adjacent to checkout tills,’ says the document. And . Mr Miliband would lead a new drive to force millions of people to get . off their backsides and get fit, stating ‘lack of physical activity and . sedentary lifestyles are associated with a wide range of physical and . mental health conditions’. However, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham believes the plan should be central to Labour's election manifesto . He wants ‘daily physical activity’ with ‘an ambition to get half the population physically active by 2025.’ The document adds: ‘We are currently looking at the best definition of physically active for this purpose’. His get fit plan includes a lottery fund to ‘finance the construction of skateboard parks, BMX tracks, netball and basketball courts. All school pupils will be taught to swim and ride a bike safely.’ Labour will aim to ensure all children do a minimum of two hours of PE a week. Leaked Labour Policy review page 1 .

"Kris Commons spoke of his relief at securing his Celtic future on Thursday night – and warned that he is now in the perfect frame of mind to fight a battle on four fronts. The impasse between the 31-year-old and the club was ended when the midfielder signed a two-year deal to kill off former manager Neil Lennon’s hopes of luring him to Bolton Wanderers under freedom of contract. Commons, who Lennon signed from Derby in 2011, had looked to be on the way out of the club due to Celtic’s initial unwillingness to offer him a straight two-year deal. Kris Commons is relieved to have signed a new two-year contract with Celtic . The Mansfield-born star underscored his worth to the club when he scored a spectacular second goal in Sunday’s League Cup semi-final win over Rangers. And  the club broke with recent policy for players over 30 by agreeing a deal which keeps him at Celtic Park until 2017. Commons said: ‘It’s a great feeling. It’s a huge burden off my shoulders. Now I can concentrate on the proper stuff which is playing football and winning trophies at this club. ‘I’m delighted to be staying here. Absolutely buzzing. It’s been a strange couple of months. Speculation is never good for the mind when you are trying to concentrate on playing at the top level. Glasgow and Celtic feel like home to myself and my family. ‘That’s credit to the people of Glasgow and how they’ve welcomed us right from the word go. It’s a very family orientated club and it’s a massive relief for myself and my family that our future is secure now. ‘I want to win more league titles here. It would be wonderful if we could add a few more cups to the cabinet but I think when you think of Celtic it’s all about European football and if we can get into the Champions League again next year and hopefully the year after that it would be a huge achievement for us. The 31-year-old was Celtic's top scorer last season with 31 goals in all competitions . ‘The Inter Milan game will be a big draw with a full house under the floodlights. That’s always a magical experience so hopefully we can turn up for that game and give them a sense of what we are all about. ‘That’s a good game to look forward to. But we’re involved in all four competitions so hopefully we’ll have a very successful year.’ The reigning PFA Scotland and SFWA player of the year, Commons scored 31 goals in Lennon’s final year in Glasgow. But, despite his popularity with the fans, a string of substitute appearances at the outset of Ronny Deila’s reign gave fuel to the theory that he wasn’t in the Norwegian’s long-term plans. Deila not only denied that, he predicted that Commons would remain at the club throughout the contract impasse. Manager Ronny Deila has spoken of his delight that Commons has committed his future to the club . Deila said: ‘I am really pleased that Kris has committed his future to the club. ‘He is someone who has already made a great contribution to Celtic and I am sure he will continue to be a very important player for us as we work hard to bring our fans the success they deserve.” ‘We have had a good week after reaching the League Cup final and following the fantastic signings of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, Kris’s contract extension is even more great news for the club and our supporters.’","Kris Commons speaks of relief at signing two-year deal with Celtic .

"Rugby union's world governing body has requested 'a full report' from Welsh rugby chiefs after George North suffered two blows to the head during Friday night's RBS 6 Nations opener against England. The juggernaut Wales wing took an accidental boot to the head from England lock Dave Attwood in the first-half, and he was temporarily replaced by Liam Williams while he underwent mandatory concussion assessment. North subsequently returned to the field, but he then clashed heads with team-mate Richard Hibbard during the second-half in what appeared to be a worse incident, and that has now attracted World Rugby's attention. George North (left) is taken off the field by Wales team doctor Geoff Davies before later returning . North (bottom) is inadvertently kicked in the face by England second row Dave Attwood on Friday . The Wales wing appeared to be knocked out twice during his side's 21-16 Six Nations loss against England . North did not go off a second time, playing on as England started their Six Nations season with a 21-16 victory. In a statement, World Rugby, formerly the International Rugby Board, said: 'World Rugby has requested a full report from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) following an apparent head impact sustained by Wales wing George North in the second-half of Friday night's RBS 6 Nations match between Wales and England at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. 'North, who sustained the impact in the 61st minute of the match, remained on the field. 'And, having undertaken an initial review of the broadcast footage, World Rugby is seeking to establish from the WRU whether all concussion management protocols were appropriately followed. 'Concussion management and education is at the heart of World Rugby's player welfare strategy designed to protect players at all levels of the game and promote the very highest standards of education, coaching and medical care.' For their part, the Wales squad management issued a medical update on Saturday that stated North was 'currently symptom free,' although they have also viewed footage of the second incident. 'In relation to George North, he passed head injury protocol tests that were carried out in the medical room, in addition to an on-pitch assessment,' Wales said. 'He also showed no signs and symptoms when follow-up tests were carried out immediately after the game. North (right) and his captain Sam Warburton look on during Wales' defeat to England . The 22-year-old (left), missing a tackle on Jonathan Joseph, saw his game suffer after the first head injury . 'While George is currently symptom free, retrospective video review of the second incident identified the mechanism of injury which was previously unsighted on the field of play. 'This review has warranted the medical team to manage the player as concussed, although the player currently has no signs and symptoms. 'He will now undertake a graduated return to play protocol with multiple follow-up cognitive and physical tests.' The North episode caused a widespread reaction throughout the rugby community. Former England captain Lewis Moody said on Twitter: 'Why was George North not taken off. Terrible decision by the medics. Out cold .' And ex-England skipper Will Carling tweeted: 'I really don't think George North should still be on the pitch. He looks very dazed....'

North, meanwhile, missed Wales' victory over South Africa earlier this season after being treated for concussion during the defeat against world champions New Zealand seven days earlier. Wales also said on Saturday that prop Samson Lee was concussed during the England clash. 'He will also be undertaking a graduated return to play protocol, consisting of a number of cognitive and physical tests prior to returning to training,' Wales added, in their statement. 'Dan Biggar sustained a laceration to his forehead following an accidental collision with team-mate Gethin Jenkins. He will be managed accordingly in the build-up to the Scotland fixture. 'Leigh Halfpenny sustained a mild neck injury that will be treated by the medical team this week. This injury is unlikely to keep the player out for the following week's fixture.'

"Follow Sportsmail's live coverage as Argentina avenged their World Cup final woes with a 4-2 win against Germany in Dusseldorf on Wednesday night. Manchester United's new signing Angle di Maria showed his class with a stunning performance which saw the winger bag a hat-trick of assists as well as a brilliant solo goal. Sergio Aguero opened the scoring before Erik Lamela doubled Argentina's lead on a good night for Premier League talent. At the other end Chelsea's Andre Schurrle grabbed a consolation goal before substitute Mario Gotze helped Germany threatened a comeback. Click here to read the match report in full. Host commentator . It's all over as Argentina well and truly get their revenge against World Cup winner Germany with an impressive 4-2 win. A stunning individual performance from Angel di Maria saw the United winger bag three assists and a goal and Sergio Aguero and Erik Lamela also scored. Chelsea's Andre Schurrle responded for Germany but it was too little to late as Argentina raced into a 4-0 lead early on in the second half. 91mins: We're into stoppage time in Dusseldorf now as Germany continue to push. Argentina have the ball on the halfway line though as Martino's side look to see out the game. Gotze has given Germany an extra edge but it's been too little to late. 88mins: Germany are giving a final push as they look to continue their comeback and avoid what will be their first defeat in 15 months. Mullers lofts the ball towards Gotze but he can't control the ball and lets it go out for an Argentina goal kick. 85mins: Di Maria comes off for Sunderland new boy Ricardo Alvarez. The Manchester United new boy has had a brilliant evening and deservedly shares a joke with Martino as he leave the field. Three assists and a goal. Louis van Gaal will take that against QPR next weekend. 83mins: Aguero makes a powerful run but just lets the ball run away from his as substitute Antonio Rudiger clears the danger. Gotze has done it again for Germany but his celebrations don't quite match those in Brazil two months ago. Reus curled in a corner which the Argentina defence failed to deal with and the ball fell kindly for Gotze who smashed the ball home thanks to a large deflection. 75mins: Reus hits a fabulous right-footed strike from the left corner of Argentina's penalty area which crashes against Romero's left post before being cleared for a corner. 73mins: It's all a bit stop and start now as a few tackles start flying in. Germany attack with Gotze before the move breaks down as Aguero drops deep to claim the ball. 70mins: Another change for Germany Kroos is replaced by Sebastian Rudy to earn his second cap. 68mins: Lamela makes way for Fernando Gago. The Tottenham man has done himself no harm with his performance tonight. Who knows? Maybe Lionel Messi will be looking over his shoulder... 62mins: Muller tries to thread the ball into the path of Gotze but Romero gathers gratefully. Straight after that, Fernandez robs Reus of the ball in the Argentina penalty area to give away a corner which is then cleared. 58mins: Schurrle and Gomez make way for Gotze and Muller with almost 60 minutes played in Dusseldorf. Can Gotze add to his World Cup heroics this evening? He's got his work cut out... 56mins: The players catch their breathe after a whirlwind start to the second half which saw three goals in seven minutes. Low is about to make some changes... This is getting silly now. Germany win a corner at the other end before Schurrle pokes home after a scramble inside the Argentina box. Is the comeback on? Outstanding! Di Maria now has a goal to add to his hat-trick of assists. The Manchester United winger raced through on the right before delightfully chipping the ball over Weidenfeller. It's the worst possible start for Germany as Di Maria swings in a dangerous free-kick which Fernandez heads home to bag his third goal in an Argentina shirt. That's now three assists for Di Maria the £60million man. We're back underway as Germany look to comeback from their 2-0 deficit. Argentina have looked clinical tonight while the World Cup winners have been extremely wasteful. Germany won't want to celebrate their World Cup win with defeat here. Stay tuned... Half-time change for Germany as captain for the evening Neuer comes off for Roman Weidenfeller. Podolski will skipper the side for the second half. It's half-time in Dusseldorf and it's save to say Argentina are getting their revenge for the World Cup final defeat back in July. Goals from Aguero and Lamela give Argentina a deserved two-goal lead at the break with Angel di Maria laying on both goals for his team-mates. It may be a lot of money, but in today's marker, Di Maria is looking like a £60million player. Another big opportunity falls Gomez's way and he's fluffed his lines for the third time. Kroos forces a save for Romero and the ball cannons back to Gomez who can only fire wide from six-yards out. It's 2-0 and Tottenham star Erik Lamela has doubled Argentina's lead. Di Maria picks up another assists as he finds too much space along the right. The United winger crosses perfectly for Lamela who strokes the ball into the top corner with the inside of his left boot. Spurs fans will be happy with that one! 37mins: Schurrle comes close for Germany as Kroos lofts in a delightful ball into the far post. The Chelsea forward controls the ball before volleying his shot just over Romero's crossbar. Rojo didn't get near him... 36mins: Di Maria bombs down the right once again as Durm struggles to keep pace with him. Unfortunately for Argentina, the winger can only fire his cross into the feet of Ginter. 33mins: It's an early bath for Draxler who seems to have picked up a hamstring injury as Arsenal forward Podolski replaces him. 28mins: Brilliant save from Romero as Gomez looked set to pull Germany back into the game. The big German found himself one-on-one with the Argentine keeper who stuck out his left leg to stop Gomez's shot brilliantly. The strike came after fantastic work from Kramer, who jinked through the Argentina box before laying the ball off. 22mins: Germany attempt to hit back as Kroos finds space on the edge of the box, but the German drags his shot slightly wide. Low doesn't look to pleased with his side's start... And Argentina have the lead as Aguero volleys home at the far post. The ball fell to Di Maria on the righthand side and the Manchester United winger curled in a beautiful cross for Aguero to tap in. 17mins: Demichelis is shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Reus. Germany are controlling the tempo of the game so far and are more than happy to pick Argentina off on the counter. Still 0-0 though! 13mins: Argentina are growing into the game, but the majority of the match is being played in midfielder. Germany look to counter-attack with Schurrle who wins a corner, but it comes to nothing. 7mins: Huge chance for Gomez to mark his return to the Germany first team with a goal after a brilliant through ball from Kroos left him in the clear. Romero stood his ground to save a tame effort from Gomez. At the other end, Di Maria fires a shot over the Germany bar. 6mins: First attack for Germany as Durm bombs down the left before attempting to find Gomez in the box. The ball is cleared for a Germany corner which is eventually cleared. 3mins: As you'd expect it's a slow start to the game as each team takes turns in passing the ball along the back four. Argentina's front three look lively though as Aguero is fouled by Reus in the centre circle. We're underway in Dusseldorf as Argentina take kick-off. Can Gerardo Martino's side take revenge for their World Cup final defeat or will a new wave of Germany youngsters prove too strong tonight? Stay here to find out... It's national anthem time and the Argentina players don't seem too happy about being in Germany tonight for what seems like an extended World Cup winning party... There's a few big hugs being spread around in Dusseldorf as Germany say goodbye to a number national team legends. Klose, Mertesacker and Philipp Lahm have all  retired and are receiving special shirts and photographs as the sold out stadium gives each player a brilliant ovation. It's no doubt something the Germany fans and players will have been excited about. They will be walking out at the Esprit Arena with four stars above their famous crest as Germany rightfully commemorate their 2014 World Cup win. There's certainly one for Manchester United fans to keep an eye on tonight as Premier League new boy starts for Argentina. Di Maria signed for a £60million British record fee during the summer and will line-up alongside Tottenham's Erik Lamela and Manchester City's Sergio Aguero. Germany: Neuer; Grosskreutz, Ginter, Howedes, Durm; Kramer, Kroos, Schurrle, Reus, Draxler; Gomez. Argeninta: Romero, Zabaleta, Fernandez, Demichelis, Rojo, Perez, Mascherano, Biglia, Lamela, Di Maria, Aguero . Hello and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of the international not-so-friendly match between Germany and Argentina.

"Host commentator . Host commentator . Real Madrid were taken apart by Atletico Madrid at the Vicente Calderon with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale spectators as Diego Simone’s side ran riot in a  4-0 victory. It is the first time in 64 years that Real have lost three straight games in the ground of their neighbours but this was different – this was embarrassing for the richest club in football, smothered from the first kick to last by their poor-relations city neighbours. CLICK HERE TO READ PETE JENSON'S FULL MATCH REPORT . It's all over in Madrid as the home side earn a memorable victory at the Vicente Calderon. Goals from Tiago, Saul, Griezmann and Mandzukic secured a fantastic three points for Simeone's side who are now just four points behind the Galacticos. And that's four! Torres drives down the right and lofts in a beautiful cross for Mandzukic to power home with his head. Real have been outplayed and outclassed this afternoon. 87mins: Ronaldo sums up his own afternoon by running the ball straight out of play as he attempted to bring his team forward. One to forget for the La Liga leaders. 85mins: Jese is shown a yellow card for a poor challenge on Miranda. 82mins: Real are now camped inside Atleti's half but the home side have just been too good today. Godin clears, Torres collects on the halway line before earning his team a free-kick. 79mins: Bale wins a corner for Real as the visitors look to restore some pride at the very least. Kroos' first attempt is cleared and his second lands on the left boot of Illarramendi, who fires just over. 75mins: Griezmann, who has worked his socks off today, is replaced to that man Fernando Torres. Pete Jenson: The last time Atletico Madrid beat Real 3-0 at home in the league it was 1970. No wonder Ancelotti is bringing on Chicharito . Pete Jenson: No one deserves a goal more than Griezmann. Arda's cross headed back across goal and the Frenchman wants it more than his international team-mate Varane. 3-0. This is now embarrassing for Real Madrid. They have been out-fought by Simeone's team before, but never out-played like this. Illarramendi replaces Isco. It's three! This time it's Griezmann at the far post with an easy tap in following some brilliant work by Turan and Mandzukic. Turan skips along the edge of Madrid's penalty before lofting a cross to Mandzukic who heads the ball back into the path of Griezmann. 60mins: Atletico come seriously close to a third as Griezmann makes the most of a Real defensive mix-up before hitting his shot straight at Casillas. Pete Jenson: Bale looks a different player in the second half getting up and down the pitch demanding the ball. And Jese threatening down the left. Still no news of Ronaldo. 57mins: Bale and Mandzukic were involved in a slight tangle as the latter is former is fouled. Godin is the latest name to enter the referee's book for dissent. Pete Jenson: It says a lot about Raul Garcia that he can pick up a suspension when he is not even on the pitch. He is booked for dissent while warming up and will now miss the next game. 47mins: Ronaldo stands with his hands on his hips inside the Atleti box as the referee calls for a foul by the Portuguese forward. At the other end, the home fans are going mad as their counter-attack hits a wall after Mandzukic fouls Nacho. 46mins: Jese replaces Khedira for the second half as Ancelotti opts for a more attacking formation with his team searching for three goals. We're back underway in Madrid. Can Carlo Ancelotti's side turn things around against their bitter rivals? They've got 45 minutes to do so... Pete Jenson: Notable that no Real Madrid player said anything to a team-mate walking off the pitch. Each one with his head down. Perhaps they are saving it for the dressing room. Defenders have not been great but they will be asking where the protection has been. Jese warming up and will come on at the start of the second half. Pete Jenson: Ronaldo wearing new bright yellow boots in this game. And that’s the best you can say about him after that first half. Bale equally as irrelevant. While two World Cup winners Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira completely over-run in midfield. And the less said about Real Madrid’ defence and goalkeeper the better. Atletico too intense for their rivals and had Griezmann's goal stood, as it should have done, they would be 3-0 up. 45mins: Soft yellow card for Gabi, who perhaps just went into the back of Coentrao as the pair went up for a header. 43mins: Griezmann and Siqueira link up well on the left before winning a throw-in for their side deep inside Real's half. Just two minutes until the break now, what a half for Simeone's side. 37mins: Real attempt to turn the screw as Benzema looks to go it alone with a solo run into the Atleti box but he's easily outnumbered. Bale bombs down the right but his cross has too much on it and goes out for a throw. 35mins: The Atleti playes, perhaps unfairly, have just screamed at the referee for what the believed to be a handball after Khedira blocked a shot from Godin. 31mins: Kroos swings in a free-kick which momentarily cause chaos in the Atleti box. The ball bobbles around before Benzema forces a saves from Moya and the home side clear. 28mins: Kroos is shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Griezmann. The Real players look shellshocked. Pete Jenson: Even Toni Kroos losing his cool chopping down Griezmann. Cynical and deserving of the yellow he was shown. Pete Jenson: Arda Turan wriggles away from Coentrao but linesman flags a foul. Turan doesn't throw his boot this time. He's happy - Atletico on top and he's giving the reserve left back big problems. 26mins: Real attack with Ronaldo on the right but the Galactico aimlessly loops a ball into the Atleti box without looking. Moya collects the ball easily. Pete Jenson: Griezmann scores but is incorrectly flagged offside. Madrid are a disaster at the back without Pepe and Ramos. The home side have doubled their lead and it's the substitute Saul with a brilliant overhead kick just outside Real Madrid's six-yard box. The strike came after some lovely individual work from Siqueira, who drove into the box before setting up his team-mate. Pete Jenson: Most unlikely of scorers. Tiago on 13 minutes aftetr Juanfran's corner is laid off by Mandzukic. Casillas' fumble in part responsible. And Atletico have lead! Tiago strikes from the edge of the area and Casillas lets the ball slip underneath his right arm. First blood to Simeone's side! Pete Jenson: Big blow for Atleico losing Koke who looked as if he was caught late by Khedira. Saul, who Premier League clubs were looking at last season when he was on loan at Rayo, is on. Godin has a bloody nose - also from Khedira. 10mins: Early change for the home side as Saul replaces the injured Koko. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: Atletico kicking into the end where their most vocal supporters are - they would have preferred that second half. Early signs of how wobbly Real might be today with Coentrao almost fouling Arda in the area. Mandzukic and Griezmann start ahead of Torres after scoring in Atletico's recent win against Eibar. Torres will have to make an impact from the subs' bench if he is to establish himself in Atletico's first team. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo returns to action after serving a two-match ban for his two moments of madness against Cordoba. The former Manchester United forward has scored 15 goals against Atletico since joining Real in 2009. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Madrid derby between Atletico and Real. La Liga champions Atletico Madrid will be hoping to close the seven-point gap on Carlo Ancelotti's side by picking up all three points against their rivals. The teams are in and the big talking point is Diego Simeone's decision to leave Fernando Torres on the bench.

"New Argentina boss Gerardo Martino has slammed the level of media scrutiny directed at those who manage superstars such as Lionel Messi, claiming the joy is taken away from coaching such talent. Martino suggests the enormous pressure and constant questioning surrounding Messi means coaches will be criticised regardless of the talisman's performances. The former Barcelona manager will team up with the four-time Ballon d'Or winner having replaced Alejandro Sabella, who left the post following Argentina's agonising World Cup final defeat to Germany in July. Thankless: Gerardo Martino says managers who coach Lionel Messi can never win due to the level of scrutiny . 'When you get the chance to coach a footballer like Leo it's very difficult to be exempt from comments and rumours,' said Martino ahead of Wednesday's World Cup final rematch against Germany. 'In our time together at Barcelona, it was said he was saving himself for the World Cup. But in La Liga he scored about 30 goals. 'There were always questions about Leo, if he scored three goals then why had he scored three goals? If he scored one, then why had he only scored one? And if didn't score at all, it was the same.' Injured: Lionel Messi picked up a groin injury during Barcelona's 1-0 win over Villarreal on Sunday . Barcelona's talisman was a late withdrawal from the squad to play Joachim Low's men in the friendly having picked up an injury on Sunday and Martino revealed national team doctors will travel to Catalunya to check up on his injury after Wednesday's game. 'Now rumours are circulating again. Unfortunately we coaches happen to be here to clarify the rumours, which become tiresome,' he added. 'After the game against Germany, the national team doctor will go and see Messi [in Barcelona], . 'Sometimes it's not necessary for players to come here for us to find out about the injury. We didn't have Ezequiel Garay come over from Russia. 'Sometimes it's better to have the doctors go to see the players.'

"In the eyes of Richard Gough, change cannot come quickly enough at Rangers. He feels the club he once served with distinction has reached an historic low both on and off the field. Suffering through television coverage of last Sunday’s 2-0 League Cup semi-final defeat to Celtic — in which the Ibrox side failed to register a single shot on target — was a further reminder of just how far standards have fallen. The man who captained Rangers to nine-in-a-row is a supporter of Dave King and his move to oust the current board at an Extraordinary General Meeting. And Gough believes the kind of investment in the playing squad being proposed by King and his allies is desperately needed. Former Rangers captain Richard Gough is desperate for change at Ibrox . (L/R) Richard Gough, Paul Murray, Dave King and John Gilligan speak about their views for Rangers' future . Gough (right) captained Rangers to nine successive Scottish league titles between 1988 and 1997 . ‘I’ve watched Rangers since the late 1970s. I know about the teams before then from my father and grandfather,’ said Gough. ‘This team is probably the worst Rangers team that’s ever played for the club. ‘It’s not their fault, it’s just the circumstances at the club. It could also be the worst Celtic team I’ve ever seen, to be fair. That’s the standard right now. ‘I remember speaking with David Murray, when he took over the club in 1988. We were out one night and he mentioned something about “his” club. I told him it was never his club — it’s the supporters’ club. ‘I didn’t go to Hampden on Sunday. I didn’t want to. But what struck me from watching on TV was the Rangers support. They were unbelievable, because they were watching a poor team being completely outplayed by Celtic. ‘But the Rangers fans remained very vocal in their support. That saddened me in a way because I knew if that had been a team I’d played in, which had been 2-0 down and getting played off the park by Celtic, we would have got hammered. ‘But the supporters know that the current team just doesn’t have the necessary quality. So I just hope Dave King can get control at the EGM, because it will be better for those fans again. ‘Loads of supporters have been asking me when is he going to get control. He has been trying to do something for the last few years but has just been blocked all the time. ‘Everyone has — it happened to Robert Sarver, too. The worry now is that the current team might not even get into the Premiership next season. I watch every game and it looks as if Hearts will win the Championship. It’s not a given that Rangers would get through a play-off against Hibs. Rangers captain Lee McCulloch (right) exits after a 2-0 defeat by Celtic in the Scottish League Cup . Rangers fans have not relented in their support despite the continuing problems . Gough has described Rangers current crop as 'the worst team to ever play for the club' ‘So we have to take it one step at a time. Let’s make sure Dave and the others get onto the board, get control of the club and then go from there.’ King has expressed supreme confidence about triumphing at the EGM, believing he already has more than 50 per cent of shareholders on his side. Should he be proved wrong, then Gough (right) would despair. ‘We are bang in trouble if Dave doesn’t win the day,’ said the 52-year-old. ‘I would fear for the club. In a lot of ways, it is the last chance to save it. ‘When Dave asked me to back him a while back, I thought it was the right thing to do. It’s pretty evident, with what has happened since then, that it is the right thing. ‘The club is in as bad a state as I’ve ever seen it. I’m not sure the supporters actually know how bad it is. I hear rumours all the time that there is now just one guy looking after the maintenance at Ibrox. It’s unrecognisable from what it was 10 years ago.’ Asked if he saw a role for himself under any King regime, Gough replied: ‘If Dave wanted me to do something, I would do it.’ A £10million loan from Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is currently sustaining Rangers, who this week also received five players on loan from the St James’ Park reserves until the end of the season.

"Emmanuel Adebayor was not even named among the substitutes for Tottenham's north London derby clash with rivals Arsenal on Saturday lunchtime. Mauricio Pochettino said in the build up to the clash at White Hart Lane that the Togolese centre forward was still an important player for the club, but his absence from the squad might suggest otherwise.

"Judges have expressed 'great concern' after being forced to overturn the indefinite sentence imposed on a dangerous paedophile who will now serve just 18 months behind bars. Simon Crisp twice tried to convince a 15-year-old boy to perform a sex act online and shared sickening images of children with other perverts, London’s Appeal Court heard. He was jailed indefinitely for public protection - which is almost identical to a life sentence - at Preston Crown Court in March, after computer equipment was seized by police from his home in Fleetwood, Lancashire. Court: Mr Justice Anthony Morris, left, and Mr Justice Treacy, right, said a sexual offences prevention order handed to Crisp should be 'vigorously enforced' The 36-year-old admitted three counts . of trying to incite a child to engage in sexual activity, six of making, . nine of distributing and five of possessing indecent images of . children, and one of having an extreme pornographic image. But . his open-ended sentence has now been quashed at London’s Criminal . Appeal Court and replaced with a conventional jail term of three years. Lord Justice Davis was among the judges who were anxious about the outcome . Judges . said that, while they were deeply anxious about the outcome, the law on . indeterminate sentences laid down by Parliament left them with ‘no . alternative’ but to quash Crisp’s IPP. The . decision means that, instead of remaining behind bars until the Parole . Board concludes it is safe to release him, Crisp will now be . automatically released after serving half of the three-year term. Judge . Anthony Morris QC, sitting with Lord Justice Davis and Mr Justice . Treacy, said a sexual offences prevention order handed to Crisp should . be ‘vigorously enforced’ by the probation service to ensure he doesn’t . re-offend after his release. The judge told the court Crisp’s . computer equipment, including a laptop, webcam and four discs, were . seized from his home in September last year. Before . the equipment was analysed, he admitted to police he had downloaded . pornographic images of children and had spoken to other paedophiles on . Skype - but claimed he had no sexual interest in children. Analysis . of the machine revealed over 200 indecent images of children - . including five in the most obscene category - and it was discovered . these had been sent to other people via the internet. Crisp had also tried to groom a . 15-year-old boy via a chat website on two separate occasions, but the . victim had ended the conversation before any sexual activity took place. Decision: Crisp was jailed indefinitely for public . protection - which is almost identical to a life sentence - at Preston . Crown Court (pictured) in March . A probation report concluded Crisp was a danger to the public and there was a real threat that his ‘fantasies’ about children would result in him reoffending. The court heard he had a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a three-year-old 20 years earlier, when he was aged 15. Sentencing . him, the crown court judge said a five-year sentence would have been . appropriate for the offences, but that he was ‘dangerous’ and should . therefore be locked up indefinitely. Crisp’s . lawyers argued the five-year ‘notional term’ was too long, saying the . crown court judge didn’t take enough account of the overall sentence or . the level of his offending. London's Court of Appeal heard how Crisp’s computer equipment, . including a laptop, webcam and four discs, were seized from his home in . September . Allowing the appeal, Judge Morris agreed the term was ‘excessive’ and that the IPP must be quashed - as indefinite sentences can only be imposed where the offences would justify a conventional sentence of at least four years. He told the court: 'We consider that the judge’s finding of dangerousness was fully justified on the evidence before him. 'But, by reason of this court’s decision to reduce the notional determinate term, a sentence of imprisonment for public protection was not available. 'We have great concern as to the outcome. But, as Parliament has laid down that the notional term must be at least four years for an indeterminate sentence to be imposed, we have no alternative but to quash the IPP.'","Simon Crisp tried twice to convince a 15-year-old boy to perform a sex act online .

"England captain Eoin Morgan believes the growing debate over the size of modern bats is 'absolutely ridiculous' as the International Cricket Council considers a clampdown. ICC chief executive Dave Richardson suggested earlier this week that lawmakers could look to reduce the size of bats - most significantly their depth - amid fears the balance of the game has shifted too far towards batsmen. A host of batting records have fallen in the recent past with South Africa's AB de Villiers clubbing the fastest one-day century, from 31 balls, last month while India opener Rohit Sharma hit a record 264 in November last year. England captain Eoin Morgan believes the growing debate about the size of modern bats is missing the point when rule changes in one day internationals have conspired to boost scoring . Morgan was talking in Sydney ahead of England's latest World Cup warm-up match against the West Indies . Morgan makes a point to England coach Peter Moores as the team trained at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Morgan, however, thinks those blaming bat sizes are missing the point. Instead the 28-year-old believes recent rule changes in the 50-over format have conspired to boost scoring with the move to allow a maximum of four fielders outside the ring at any point, plus the use of two new balls, more likely factors. 'I think it is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous,' he said. 'The fact that you can concentrate on the bat size when the rule change has been made so that you bowl with two new balls - the ball is never any older than 25 overs and you have an extra man in the circle. 'I think that is a point in itself. The bat size (debate) is ridiculous.' At present the length and width of the bats is regulated, but the depth has become the talking point as manufacturers have developed new ways to increase the size of the 'sweet spot'. Peter Moores leads England out for a training session at the SCG as the World Cup countdown continues . Stuart Broad is put through his paces as England tune up for the World Cup, which starts next weekend . Last year a report commissioned by the Marylebone Cricket Club - the lawmakers of the game - found the thickness of edges on modern bats had increased 300 per cent and in turn the 'sweet spot' has grown two-and-a-half times larger. Those figures have led Richardson to suggest the laws should at least be reviewed. Only last July the MCC's World Cricket Committee - which features former Australia skipper Steve Waugh - elected not to change the rules regarding bat sizes. Australia opener David Warner and West Indies' Chris Gayle are two players who have come into focus for the size of their bats but Morgan, a batsman himself, has not felt any unfair advantage has been gained. 'I haven't come across a bat yet where I've said: 'This is ridiculous, this should be outlawed',' he added. Morgan was speaking in Sydney, where England have assembled for the final part of their World Cup preparations, and was equally bullish when asked to assess his side's chances of lifting the World Cup for the first time. Fast bowler Broad receives the ball as he trains ahead of England's penultimate warm-up with the West Indies .

That's the bottom line,' he said. 'Like every other team we're here to get the best out of ourselves and us at our best we can win this World Cup. 'It is certainly the most talented squad I've ever been a part of.' England's World Cup hopes had been written off by many even before they arrived in Australia last month for the Tri-Series, when they defied expectation to reach the final. Twice they convincingly beat world champions India, although any growing belief was tempered with a third successive defeat to Australia in last week's final at the WACA Ground. Morgan's men relinquished a winning position in Perth, just as they had in Hobart in the previous game, and while the captain knows performances must be turned into wins there is reason to believe they are closing the gap on the top sides. 'We're in good shape. We've had a very productive month or so,' Morgan added. England's Chris Jordan bowls in the nets as England hold a training session in Sydney . 'We have got a lot out of playing against good opposition, particularly the games we've played against Australia. 'We've covered a lot of bases, probably more so than I thought we would to be in this position.' Morgan concedes one area of minor concern is his own form. After hitting a defiant century against Australia in the Tri-Series opener the left-hander has twice suffered first-ball dismissals and admits he would have liked to have played a match-winning hand. 'That's a big emphasis on the team and we've done that so far,' he said. 'I've not done it yet, which has been disappointing but I think I'm in a good place and a good head space for where we are at the moment.' He will most likely get two more chances to let his bat do the talking with warm-up games against West Indies and Pakistan at the SCG scheduled for later this week before England head south for their mouth-watering tournament-opener against Australia in front of 90,000 fans at the MCG on Valentine's Day.","Eoin Morgan says debate about size of modern bats is missing the point .

"Christian Benteke was dropped by Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert for the visit of Chelsea. The Belgian striker was taken out of the starting line-up after a series of disappointing displays. Instead, Gabby Agbonlahor and Andreas Weimann started up front, with Lambert hoping to break at pace against the Premier League leaders. Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert dropped Christian Benteke for his side's match against Chelsea . Benteke attempts to win possession for his side by challenging Gary Cahill and John Obi Mikel . Benteke's last goal for Aston Villa came against Blackpool in the third round of the FA Cup on January 4 . Gabriel Agbonlahor (right) started the Premier League clash in attack alongside Andreas Weimann . The Belgium international came off the substitutes' bench in the 68th minute but was unable to make an impact against Jose Mourinho's side. Benteke at his best would be undroppable, and he has scored excellent goals against United, Crystal Palace and Blackpool in the FA Cup this season. But they are his only three strikes so far since his recovery from a ruptured Achilles. The Villa manager tried to buy Rickie Lambert for £5million on transfer deadline day before the England striker elected to stay at Liverpool. ‘If I’d brought another striker in I could have played with two up front and taken the spotlight off Christian,’ said Lambert. ‘He knows himself things aren’t going his way at this moment. It has not gone unnoticed. Lambert tried to sign Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert during the January transfer window . ‘He’s looked at the stats himself. He’s not naive or silly. We’ve sat with him as staff and showed him things he can improve on. ‘Christian’s belief has not wavered. It’s not a confidence thing. His form is just not what it has been. I don’t think the injury is a problem.' It was a bold move by Lambert, given the potential for scorn from the stands by fans, but there is a sense the club's most potent striker could use a spell out of the spotlight.","Christian Benteke was named on the subs' bench for Chelsea match .

"Craig Gordon is poised to become the first new signing of Ronny Deila’s Celtic reign. The former Scotland goalkeeper has been attracting interest from Rangers, Hearts and Motherwell. But Sportsmail understands the 31-year-old underwent a medical for Celtic at a private hospital in Glasgow on Tuesday. Safe hands: Scottish goalkeeper Craig Gordon underwent a medical at a private hospital on Tuesday . Front runner: Ronny Deila is expected to be named manager of Celtic by the end of the week . All final decisions on transfer matters are on hold, however, until the new manager gives the green light. Celtic goalkeeping coach Stevie Woods is an admirer of Gordon, a free agent since quitting Sunderland with knee problems in 2012, and the anticipated arrival of the former Scotland No1 will pose fresh questions over the future of World Cup keeper Fraser Forster. Now with the England squad in the United States, the Parkhead club have slapped a £10million price tag on the head of the former Newcastle keeper. But the signing of former Hearts keeper Gordon would heighten expectations that Forster will return to the English Premiership before the transfer deadline on August 31. Claiming he is fitter than ever after two years on the sidelines, the man who cost Sunderland keeper £9million said earlier this week: ‘I’ve had two or three offers already which have been quite interesting – but it’s just about picking the right one and then I can move on from there. Back in the mix? Gordon hopes to become Scotland's first-choice goalkeeper once more . ‘You know yourself when you’re ready and you’re able to play and I feel just as good now, if not better, than I have ever done in my career. ‘Fitness-wise I’m right there. It’s just a case of getting the matches and proving it to everyone else as well.’ Gordon spent a lengthy spell last season training with Rangers at Murray Park and had an offer from first club Hearts before Celtic entered the fray.

"Celtic's quest for a domestic treble remains firmly on course after an impressive 2-0 win over Dundee in their William Hill Scottish Cup fifth-round tie at Dens Park. Striker Leigh Griffiths headed the Hoops into the lead in the seventh minute with his third goal in four games and the home side were only still in the tie at the interval thanks to keeper Scott Bain. The Scottish Premiership leaders, who face Dundee United in next month's Scottish League Cup final at Hampden Park, doubled their lead through midfielder Stefan Johansen at the start of the second half.

Subs not used: Ambrose Emuobo, Zaluska, McGregor, Henderson . Booked: Stokes 45' Scorers: Griffiths 7', Johansen 47' Ref: John Beaton . Attendance: 7,525 . Paul Hartley's side, who went into the match unbeaten in their last six outings, struggled to live with the ferocious tempo set at times by the Hoops, especially in the first half, and could not find a way back into the match as the Parkhead side ultimately cruised into the quarter-finals. And on this form Celtic might just fancy their chances in the upcoming Europa League last-32 tie against struggling Italian outfit Inter Milan. They will be boosted for those matches by new signings from Dundee United, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, who were cup-tied against the Dark Blues on Saturday. Manager Ronny Deila made only one change, bringing in wideman James Forrest for Anthony Stokes, who started on the bench. Hartley, whose new signings Alex Harris and Paul Heffernan were cup-tied from their time at Hibernian, made three changes as Stephen McGinn, Luka Tankulic and Craig Wighton came in for Harris, the injured Kevin Thomson and David Clarkson, who dropped to the bench. The game was still settling down when midfielder Nir Bitton picked out over-lapping right-back Mikael Lustig wide on the right and when he curled his cross into the middle Griffiths reacted quickest at the near post to glance a head past Bain. Hoops goalkeeper Craig Gordon pulls off a low save to his right from Dundee striker Luka Tankulic . It was a great start for Deila's side who moved forward with some pace and purpose in the search for a second. In the 23rd minute, after skipper Scott Brown had a decent effort from inside the box deflected behind for a fruitless corner, Forrest should have doubled Celtic's lead. The Scotland winger robbed Dundee skipper Gary Irvine in his own half and after playing a one-two with Johansen he found himself through on goal with only Bain to beat but the keeper blocked and the ball was scrambled to safety. The Dees keeper made further close-range saves from Griffiths and Johansen as Celtic swarmed around the opposition penalty area. Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) tussles with Dundee's Tankulic (right) during the Scottish Cup fifth-round . For their part Dundee, who had to reshuffle when Greg Stewart limped off to be replaced by Paul McGinn, brother of team-mate Stephen McGinn, had only two real efforts. A snap-shot from defender Kostadin Gadzhalov from the edge of the Celtic box whizzed past the post and just before the break, Hoops keeper Craig Gordon clawed away a deflected shot from former Parkhead midfielder Paul McGowan. Kris Commons was replaced by Stokes for the start of the second half and one of the first things the Irishman had to do was congratulate Johansen. A deep cross from Lustig found Griffiths unmarked at the back post and when his header was parried by Bain, the on-rushing Johansen fired the ball into the net. As the mood among some of the home fans momentarily turned ugly, Lustig hobbled off to be replaced by Adam Matthews before Stokes was booked for simulation. Clarkson was brought on for Wighton but there looked no way back for Dundee. On the hour-mark Johansen curled in a cross from the right which a stretching Bain palmed on to the woodwork, relieved to see the ball stay out. Stokes and Griffith had efforts either side of John Guidetti replacing Forrest and the match was controlled by the visitors all the way to the final whistle.

Staying put: England will have to play at Wembley for the next eight to nine years, says Adrian Bevington . Small crowd: Wembley stadium is expected have it's lowest attendance for an England match on Wednesday . The small crowd is a knock-on effect of England's disappointing World Cup campaign where they finished bottom of their group with two defeats and a draw from three matches. In addition, the lack of high-profile opponents for the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign has also led to concerns about filling the 90,000-capacity venue in the future. Bevington said on his Twitter account: 'People asking to take games around the country. Fair question, but fact is FA has contract with Wembley to play all home games there. 'Re Wembley. It has to be paid for. Reality is FA has to put events calendar on to do this.' Poor show: England crashed out of the group stages of the World Cup this summer . Bevington accepts that work was needed to 'regain support and rebuild excitement with England' after the disappointment of the World Cup, but pointed out that several England games at the old Wembley in the build-up to Euro 96 had attendances of well under 30,000. Last week, FA general secretary Alex Horne announced England will play four prestige friendlies against world champions Germany, Spain, Italy and France over the next two years - some home and some away.

"Pictures of the Newmarket Bar in Thurso can be found on Facebook. By any stretch the venue is unremarkable. Two bulky speakers mount a stage in front of the window, amplifying live music for the locals. It’s the kind of pub found in any Scottish town. A place where, at weekends, a man can barely manage a conversation over the din. Gary Mackay-Steven’s move to Anfield didn’t work out but he found his form at Airdrie . Working as a bar man following an ill-starred two years at Liverpool, however, Gary Mackay-Steven heard the comments. The withering asides from the other side of the bar asking what had happened to Scottish football’s next big thing. This week the 24-year-old signed for Celtic. Back when he was recuperating from a shattered hip, his future looked less certain. He took a job in the Newmarket while the injury recovered. With every pint he pulled the lips of customers loosened a little more. ‘Working in the bar was funny because, as the hours tick on, people get drunker and drunker,’ recalls Mackay-Steven now. ‘They then start to say what they think. ‘There were definitely murmurs of: “What are you doing back here?”. People would say: “You could be doing this or that”. Or ask: “What are you playing at?”.’ ‘But all that went in one ear and out the other. I always knew my vision and what I wanted to do. I was just waiting to feel good in myself again. ‘I enjoyed working there. It was nice and I appreciate a lot of things now.’ It was his first spell back in Thurso since leaving at the age of 15 to join Ross County. Gary Mackay-Steven (right) and Stuart Armstrong (left) pictured in Celtic kits at their unveilings on Tuesday . Hugh McAuley, the head of Liverpool’s academy at the time, had spotted and nurtured Steven Gerrard, Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher. He saw something in Mackay-Steven as well. The injuries were his downfall, friends and the job in the pub his salvation. ‘I had an agent David Threlfall,’ continues Mackay-Steven, ‘and I’m still with him now. He understood my decision when I said I needed to take a step back from football. ‘He was supportive and stuck by me. I remember speaking to David after a time out of the game and telling him I felt good again. I’d been training myself down my local park, just me and a ball, and I felt ready. ‘It’s funny, I still do that to this day if I have a day off. ‘I go to the park myself with a ball and practice. I feel a bit stupid — Stuart Armstrong is doing a law degree on his time off and I’m doing keepy-uppies. ‘But I don’t think I’ll ever stop that. ‘I’ve always had that passion. Even if it was raining, my mum — probably to get me out of her hair when she was cooking the dinner — would tell me to go out with a ball. But I love it.’ When the hip recovered he took a call from the manager of Airdrie United. The Excelsior Stadium was a steep downward step from Liverpool. Well-grounded and level-headed, however, Mackay-Steven realised the comeback had to start somewhere. The former Dundee duo are all smiles as they hold up their respective shirts for new side Celtic . ‘I was never feeling hard done by or “why has this happened to me?”,’ he says. ‘It was out of my hands, it could have happened to anyone. I was fortunate enough to move to Liverpool at a young age — not many people do that at such a young age. Some people my age could have been at school. ‘It gave me an experience and a taste of something which I think helped make me hungrier to get back to where I feel I can be. ‘My family — my mum in particular — were there for me and didn’t ever let me think too much about things. ‘I had massive support from them. I’ve taken a different route to the top but I’ m here now, I’m still young, fit and healthy and feel very grateful.’ Dundee United were a key cog in his revival. On You Tube a collage of his top five moments of skill, published in honour of his 24th birthday, garnered nearly 50,000 views. Brilliant individualism in Premiership games against St Johnstone and Kilmarnock have the viewer slowing down the images and pausing them to absorb the footwork fully. ‘It’s nice that people think of me as a skilful player,’ he shrugs, ‘but I think that just come naturally. ‘I’ll never change the way I play. Hopefully people enjoy it because football is about entertaining people, doing something different and getting bums off seats. ‘That’s all I try and do. End product is the most important thing, as managers always say, so maybe in the first few weeks here at Celtic I’ll give the tricks a miss.’ Mackay-Steven made his comeback at Airdrie after recovering from hip injury . Some players arrive at Parkhead and flounder. The scale and demands serve only to imtimidate them. Mackay-Steven feels better prepared because of the Liverpool set-back. And the experience he has of weathering hard times. ‘I was a young boy when I went to Liverpool but I don’t regret anything, I’d do it again if I was back there. It was an amazing experience for me. ‘I feel mentally strong, having gone through what I’ve gone through. ‘I don’t think there’s ever been a time where I thought I couldn’t make it to the top, I had faith and confidence in my ability and that’s stood me in good stead from a young age. ‘I’m here now and relishing the prospect of getting started and getting involved in the games with Celtic. ‘Obviously I appreciate it more now, I’m at a club like Celtic and I’m delighted and want to make the most of it.’ He once attended a Barcelona game at Parkhead as a spectator, but now stands in line for a home debut against Inter Milan in a fortnight. It’s a game friends, family and former customers can watch on a television on the wall of the Newmarket Bar. ‘I’m still close to a lot of people in Thurso,’ says Mackay-Steven. ‘I have a lot of friends back there. My family are still there and I like to go home when I can. It doesn’t happen very often because it’s a camel trek from here. ‘But I’m definitely still close to a lot of people there.’ Even those who once asked, through the bottom of a pint glass, if Gary Mackay-Steven’s party had ended before it ever really began.","Winger Gary Mackay-Steven joined Celtic on transfer deadline day .

"Kilmarnock find themselves in turmoil ahead of the trip to Hamilton on Saturday following the departure of manager Allan Johnston. Johnston announced he was quitting the club on Thursday moments before a Rugby Park press conference, citing the sale of striker Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United on transfer deadline day for a reported fee of £150,000, which left him with only one recognised striker, as a root cause. However, the board relieved the former Killie player of his duties on Friday morning, with assistant Gary Locke put in charge while a new boss is sought. Gary Locke (right) will step in after Allan Johnston was 'relieved of his duties' as Kilmarnock manager . A club statement read: 'Allan will stand down as manager with immediate effect and the board has therefore appointed assistant manager Gary Locke as interim manager pending a permanent appointment.' The former Hearts boss, who will be assisted by Alan Robertson, will have to deal with the same problem which proved a tipping point for Johnston. With Michael Ngoo out for the rest of the season with an ankle injury and Lee Miller still struggling with a knee complaint, the Ayrshire side have only one recognised striker - Josh Magennis - available for the Scottish Premiership clash with Accies. Killie sit six points outside the top six with a game in hand - which comes at Hamilton - but a run of two wins from 14 games had seen many fans turn against Johnston. Robbie Muirhead's sale to Dundee United caused Johnston to announce he would leave at end of the season . Josh Magennis is Killie's only fit striker following injuries to Michael Ngoo and Liam Miller . However, their position is an improvement on last season when they only avoided a relegation play-off with a 1-0 victory at Hibernian on the final day of the league season. Johnston, though, looked at his squad and envisaged a difficult run-in. On the Muirhead transfer he said: 'There is a number of things but that certainly doesn't make your job any easier. I never found out Robbie was away until five past 12. Stuff like that, it is not the way things are done.' In the club statement, however, the board did not address the departure of Muirhead, thanking Johnston for services rendered. Former Hearts manager Locke will take charge of the team against Hamilton on Saturday . The statement read: 'The board of directors would like to express its thanks to Allan Johnston for his diligent service over the last 18 months. 'Allan kept the club in the Premiership last season by recording crucial end-of-season victories and an excellent start to the current league season raised expectations. 'Unfortunately, a number of injuries to key players and a series of poor results followed and although the club sits in eighth place in the Premiership, Allan decided to announce his decision to leave the club to the media on Thursday.'","Allan Johnston quit as Kilmarnock manager over sale of  Robbie Muirhead .

"Chelsea want Cesc Fabregas to replace Frank Lampard. Fine player though Fabregas is, it is hard to imagine he will come near. Lampard changed English football. Click here to read Martin Samuel's column . Jose Mourinho is confident he has captured Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona to replace Frank Lampard at Chelsea and is hoping a deal can be announced before Spain face Holland in their opening World Cup game on Friday. He is convinced that Fabregas and Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa are both bound for Stamford Bridge this summer, as the Chelsea manager looks to spice up his attack ahead of a title challenge next season. The Blues finished third in the Premier League last season, just four points behind winners Manchester City, despite Mourinho repeatedly claiming they were not title challengers. VIDEO Scroll down for Cesc Fabregas: We never know what to expect from England . True blue? How Cesc Fabregas would look in a Chelsea shirt (image mocked up) Market movers: Mourinho also believes a deal for Atletico striker Diego Costa will be done by next week . It is hoped the signings of Fabregas and Costa, for £28million and £32m respectively, will help them win their first league title since the 2009-10 season. Despite Arsenal having a buy-back option on Fabregas, Arsene Wenger withdrew the Gunners from the race to sign the Barcelona midfielder, clearing the way for Chelsea. The midfielder, 27, who qualifies as a homegrown player in the Premier League after spending eight years at Arsenal, expressed an interest in moving back to England after just three years in Spain, having being told he could leave the Nou Camp. Confident: Mourinho believes both Fabregas and Costa are both Chelsea-bound this summer . And Spain and Barcelona team-mate Gerard Pique appeared to confirm Fabregas’ move to Chelsea during a conversation with Spain boss Vicente del Bosque at a promotional event last week. 'Despite excitement surrounding Fabregas’ move, one Chelsea season-ticket holder of 40 years has described the signing as ‘the equivalent of hiring Rafa Benitez as manager’.' Click here to read more from Chelsea fan Jon Dolan . The defender told Del Bosque: ‘He [Cesc] told me it’s all done. He’s going, €33m he told me.’ Fabregas' partner Daniella Semaan then posted an Instagram message with a picture of her and Barcelona forward Lionel Messi's partner Antonella Roccuzzo, saying: 'I miss this girl so so so so much' before using the hashtag #tevoyaextranar, translated as 'I'll miss you'. Chelsea’s interest in Costa, meanwhile, has been long-standing, with the Brazil-born striker excelling for Atletico during a campaign that saw them beat Barcelona and Real Madrid to win La Liga, and finish runners-up in the Champions League after seeing off Mourinho's side in the semi-final. Talk is cheap: Both Gerard Pique (left) and Vicente del Bosque (centre) were picked up by microphones . Sportsmail revealed on Thursday how everything was in place for the 25-year-old to complete his move, with a fee and personal terms agreed. A hamstring injury that blighted the end of his domestic season had delayed a medical, but a return to fitness has enabled him to complete that ahead of the World Cup. And Costa took another step closer to joining Chelsea following a cameo performance for Spain against El Salvador on Saturday night. Speaking after Spain's 2-0 friendly win, he told AS: 'Am I going to Chelsea? It looks like it.'

"Chelsea want Cesc Fabregas to replace Frank Lampard. Fine player though Fabregas is, it is hard to imagine he will come near. Lampard changed English football. Had Manchester United not found a midfield player to score more than 20 goals a season to match him, Chelsea might have won the League seven years on the turn. That this player was Cristiano Ronaldo, currently regarded as the best footballer in the world, confirms the nature of Lampard’s talent. Big boots to fill: Chelsea will find it difficult to replace Frank Lampard's goals from midfield next season . Clinical: Lampard averaged one goal every games three games during his 13-year career at Stamford Bridge . On the ball: Spain international Cesc Fabregas (left) is a Chelsea target to replace Lampard in their midfield . In 2004-05, Lampard scored 15 goals from midfield and Chelsea won the title. The following season he scored 19 times and Chelsea retained it. And that is how it would have continued had Ronaldo not begun to outscore him. In 2006-07, Lampard got 21 to Ronaldo’s 23 — so Manchester United won the League. The following year, Ronaldo was simply unstoppable with 42 to Lampard’s 20 — another title for United. In Ronaldo’s final season, he scored 26, Lampard 20 and he left Manchester United as champions. With Ronaldo at Real Madrid, Lampard’s 27 goals in 2009-10 helped return the title to Stamford Bridge. Fabregas is a beautiful footballer but as a goalscorer he is not in Lampard’s class. Hit and miss: During his spell at Arsenal, Fabregas only managed a goal every five games in 303 appearances . World's best: Lampard goalscoring feats can only be matched by Cristiano Ronaldo's at Manchester United . He scored three goals in 2004-05, five the next season, four the season after that. His goals total for Arsenal was 57 across all competitions in 303 appearances, an average of one every 5.3 games. Lampard bows out with one in three for Chelsea, Ronaldo with one every 2.4 for Manchester United. Unlike Lampard in his twilight years, however, he was always used in a forward role. Special: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) hailed Lampard (left) as 'the best for 10 years' Jose Mourinho’s tribute to Lampard summed up his worth. He scorned matters of opinion and stuck only to the facts. ‘Go to the number of matches he played, the number of goals he scored, the number of assists, the number of ball recoveries, the areas on the pitch he was playing,’ he said. ‘Lampard was the best for 10 years.’ That is some act to follow.","Frank Lampard will be near-on impossible to replace at Chelsea .

"Carl Froch’s stunning win over George Groves at Wembley in May can now officially be declared the biggest grossing fight on British soil in history, with the largest ever purse, of £10million. Froch took home £8m and Groves £2m. Sportsmail’s analysis of the finances behind the occasion shows the total income from the night was more than £22m, more than any other fight in Britain, while the crowd of 77,000 beat the previous British record of just over 70,000, set in 1933 at White City when Jack Petersen beat Jack Doyle. What started out as a straightforward rematch quickly gained momentum as a sporting and marketing phenomenon. As Froch said, it was ‘the fight the British public want to see’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Froch V Groves I & II highlights . Punch line: Carl Froch’s explosive right-hand finish to the fight at Wembley . VIDEO Froch v Groves II highlights . Froch had won their first fight in controversial fashion in November last year, and as soon as promoter Eddie Hearn put the tickets on sale for Wembley — where pride and bragging rights were up for grabs as much as Froch’s IBF and WBA Super Middleweight titles — 60,000 were sold within an hour. A further 20,000 were made available and most of those quickly went as well. With prices ranging from £30 to £500, the evening was affordable to a vast demographic of fight fans who flocked to London from all parts of the country. The total gate receipts were £6m, putting the average price paid at £78 per person. Millions watched via pay-per-view (PPV) on Sky, either at home or in pubs and clubs around the country. The PPV sales were around 900,000 at £16.95, giving a UK take of just over £15m. The way in which this cash is split is strictly confidential, but it is understood Sky took around 50 per cent of the PPV income and, as part of that deal, paid for the production and promotional costs. Take that: Groves lands a punch on Froch during the mega-fight . The amount generated from pay per view sales for Floyd Mayweather Jr v Saul Alvarez in 2013 - the current world record. The fight was shown on television in 60 countries, including on HBO in America, but the international income was on a much lower level than domestic earnings — to be expected for an all-British fight. The international TV take was around $1m (£580,000). The fight also attracted sponsorship partners who poured around £250,000 into the coffers. Merchandise and hospitality sales added another £250,000 for a grand total of around £22.3m. Down you go: Froch sends Groves to the canvas to win the fight and retain his titles . The biggest expense was the purse for Froch and Groves, the former keeping his titles and the lion’s share of the money thanks to that sensational right-hand knockout punch in the eighth round. Sky were the second biggest beneficiaries with their share of the PPV cash, while the FA earned £500,000 for renting out Wembley. Winner: Frochj celebrates his win infront of the massive Wembley crowd . A similar amount went on the undercard purses. Policing costs were included in the Wembley bill but extra security came out of the takings.

"Virgin Trains lost its lucrative West Coast mainline franchise yesterday and its boss, Sir Richard Branson, immediately predicted the winning rail operator would ‘go bankrupt’ as a result. Virgin Trains has run the service from London to Scotland for 14 years, but was beaten by FirstGroup in a bidding process the tycoon described as ‘insane’. Sir Richard said the winning £6.5billion deal was ‘verging on suicidal’ and vowed never to bid for a rail franchise again unless David Cameron personally apologises to him. Scroll down for video . Blow: Sir Richard Branson's train company has lost its West Coast franchise but has today vowed to run it for free if Labour manages to halt the contract being signed by FirstGroup tomorrow . FirstGroup has promised better . services and cheaper fares. Ministers insisted the bid had been ‘tested’ and found to be ‘robust’, accusing Sir Richard of ‘amnesia’ over his . own rail firm’s failures. But the Virgin tycoon said travellers . will be the losers from what he feared would be a string of broken . promises leading to big fare rises and worsening services.

City appeared to share his concerns as shares in FirstGroup – Britain’s . biggest train operator – plummeted. Among his unlikely allies is the . militant RMT union which called the deal ‘a total con’ and is . threatening industrial action over feared job losses. Sir Richard said FirstGroup had bid . £750million more than his own Virgin Trains but claimed this was ‘too . much’ and predicted FirstGroup would back out before the end of the . contract. Yesterday’s decision also sparked a . row over the true cost of the winning bid – the Department for Transport . claimed FirstGroup had bid £5.5billion. But when challenged by the Mail it . admitted that the true figure was at least £1billion more when a key . 20-month extension clause is counted. Unions believe FirstGroup and the . Government had tried to ‘spin’ the figures to prevent jitters in the . City and concern among taxpayers. Stung by the criticisms, Transport . Minister Theresa Villiers accused Sir Richard of ‘amnesia’ about the . poor performance and troubles his own franchises, Virgin West Coast and . Cross Country, had faced in the past. She insisted the new franchise would . deliver ‘big improvements for passengers with more seats and plans for . more services’ and passenger satisfaction targets included for the first . time. The minister stressed that FirstGroup . will face penalties totalling £265million in bonds and guarantees if it . ‘walks away’ early – a sum critics deride as ‘peanuts.’ First Group says it will cut the . price of the most expensive standard ‘Anytime’ fares by 15 per cent over . the first two years, but passengers will still face . Government-sanctioned inflation-busting rises of up to 11 per cent on . regulated fares. Action: RMT general secretary Bob Crow says the union is already preparing a ballot for industrial action over threatened job cuts while Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said 'big improvements for passengers' were planned . Upset: Sir Richard has taken to Twitter to express his frustration with the decision suggesting FirstGroup offered way too much money for the franchise while accusing the government of 'insanity' in its decision . National Express was awarded the East Coast franchise in 2007 - a year after the Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) was forced to quit the franchise in 2006 because of financial problems. It agreed to pay the government £1.4bn to run the East Coast main line, which runs between Edinburgh and London, until 2015. It was operated by a subsidiary of National Express, NXEC, which is a stand-alone company. At the time, many rail analysts said it had paid too much for the franchise. NXEC assumed that revenue from fares would rise by around 10 per cent a year. However, in 2009 it went up by a recession-hit 0.3 per cent, and as a result National Express lost £20million in the first six months. The firm was told by its lawyers that it could walk away from the contract, and lose a maximum of £72million as a result. The government eventually stripped the firm of its contract in 2009 after it failed to make contracted payments. Whitehall announced it would temporarily re-nationalise the franchise before re-tendering in 2010. In a strongly-worded statement, Sir . Richard said that he was ‘extremely disappointed’ with the franchise . decision made by the Department for Transport. He said GNER and National Express had been hit with bankruptcy after they ‘overbid’ for the East Coast mainline franchise. He went on: ‘Sadly, the Government . has chosen to take that risk with FirstGroup and we only hope they will . continue to drive dramatic improvements on this line for years to come . without letting everybody down.’ Sir Richard, who is currently on his . private island of Necker in the British Virgin Islands, added that this . was the fourth time Virgin had been outbid in a franchise tender . process. He went on: ‘On the past three . occasions, the winning operator has come nowhere close to delivering . their promised plans and revenue, and has let the public and country . down dramatically. ‘GNER and National Express . over-promised in order to win the franchise and spectacularly ran into . financial difficulties in trying to deliver their plans. ‘The East Coast is still in . Government ownership and its service is outdated and underinvested, . costing passengers and the country dearly as a result. ‘Insanity is doing the same thing . over and over again and expecting different results. When will the . Department for Transport learn?’ He said he had not made ‘a fuss’ when . Virgin Trains lost three previous bids, but said: ‘On this occasion I . feel enough is enough.’ He was now considering legal action and would leave ‘no stone unturned.’ Ministers say the new franchise will provide an extra 12,000 seats from 11 new six-car electric trains from December 2016. FirstGroup chief executive Tim O’Toole said his company would be making ‘significant improvements, including reduced journey times, and introducing new direct services’. He insisted: ‘Our track record is that we do deliver.’ All change: Virgin has operated the West Coast line . for 15 years, introducing tilting high-speed Pendolino (pictured) trains to the . route and increasing passenger levels from around 13 million a year in . 1997 . By RUTH SUNDERLAND . Sir Richard Branson is extremely talented at two things – making piles of money from his Virgin brand and feuding. His list of previous enemies includes BA boss Willie Walsh and the former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns, who thwarted his bid to win the National Lottery franchise. So it was predictable that he would . unleash a torrent of fury when Virgin Rail lost the West Coast operating . franchise to FirstGroup yesterday. The decision, Branson said, was pure ‘insanity.’ He claimed FirstGroup . had bid far too much for the franchise and risked exposing passengers to . poorer service and bigger fares. The Government says benefits of the new franchise will include: . - Around 12,000 extra seats a day when the new 11 six-car electric trains come into service . - 106 extra Pendolino carriages which will deliver more than 28,000 extra daily seats . - A number of new services including a London Euston to Blackpool service from 2013 and, from 2016, services from London to Telford Central, Shrewsbury and Bolton . - Journey time improvements between London and Glasgow are planned, as well as additional services from London to Preston. - First West Coast will spend at least £22 million on a station investment programme. FirstGroup, he suggested, was likely to suffer a similar fate to . previous franchise bidders who had over-reached themselves and ended up . in financial difficulty, letting down customers and the country as a . whole. This might strike some as a bit rich coming from a man whose potentially . lucrative takeover of Northern Rock  could leave the Treasury with a . £400million loss. Tim O’Toole, the chief executive of FirstGroup, reckons Branson is a bad . loser. ‘If he had won, he would just be cashing a very large cheque on . Necker Island,’ O’Toole said yesterday. So who is right? The reaction from the stock market seemed to come down on the side of Branson. Shares in FirstGroup sank like a stone, losing six per cent of their . value. By contrast, Stagecoach, Branson’s joint venture partner in . Virgin Rail, saw its shares rise almost two per cent. The stock market, though, is notoriously volatile and a cool  analysis . of the proposals suggests there is less of a gulf between the bids than . Branson’s outburst might suggest. FirstGroup has pledged to return £5.5bn to the Government over the life . of the franchise, while Virgin offered £4.8bn. Whether or not FirstGroup . will actually be able to make this payment, of course,  depends on how . much revenue it can extract from passengers. It reckons it can squeeze out growth of 10.4 per cent a year, compared . with the 10.2 per cent Virgin made over the past decade and the 8.5 per . cent growth target it set. That is a tall order, Virgin has already transformed  a line that had . been a basket case, meaning there is less scope for future improvements. FirstGroup insists it can deliver  by providing more seats on more . trains. As for the threat to services and jobs, it  argues Virgin’s bid . involved paring £45million from costs, double the amount of cost-cutting . FirstGroup is proposing. The stakes in this row are very high. If it turns out that FirstGroup . has indeed overplayed its hand, it may well end up taking an axe to . jobs. As a nuclear option, it could simply walk away from the franchise, admittedly with a £265million penalty. Passengers could be forgiven for thinking that both sides in this row . are as bad as each other, while they are merely piggybank in the middle.","FirstGroup will take over the route from London to Scotland in December .

"Fears that Ebola may reach Britain intensified last night after a passenger from a flight which stopped in Sierra Leone fell ill at Gatwick airport and died later in hospital. The 72-year-old woman became ill and collapsed after she left a Gambia Bird jet arriving from the West African country. A total of 826 people have died in Africa as a result of an outbreak of the deadly virus which began in February - 256 of these lived in Sierra Leone. Scroll down for video . The woman, who was tested for Ebola arrived at Gatwick on a Gambia Bird jet from Sierra Leone (file picture) The woman was reportedly vomiting heavily and sweating profusely, but tests last night showed that the woman did not have the virus . The plane, which had 128 passengers on board, was quarantined as officials traced those who had been in contact with the woman. An airport worker told the Daily Mirror: ‘We’ve all seen how many people have died from Ebola, especially in Sierra Leone, and it’s terrifying. The woman was sweating buckets and vomiting. ‘Paramedics arrived to try to help her. The next thing everybody was there… emergency crews, airfield operations, even immigration. Latest figures from the World Health Organisation show the outbreak of the deadly virus in western Africa has infected more than 1,300 people . ‘They closed down the jet bridge and put the aircraft into quarantine. ‘They took everyone’s details, even the guy who fuels the aircraft.’ The flight landed at Gatwick on Saturday morning via stops in Freetown, Sierra Leone and Banjul in The Gambia. A spokesman for Gatwick said the passenger boarded the plane in The Gambia. A nurse in Liberia in protective clothing is sprayed with disinfectant. There is no cure for Ebola, which is spread by close contact . Last night the Department of Health said that tests on the woman proved negative for Ebola. A spokesman for Public Health England said the woman’s symptoms had suggested Ebola was very unlikely but the tests were carried out as a precaution. A spokesman for South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust added: ‘We were called to Gatwick Airport on Saturday at 8.27am to attend to a patient who had been taken unwell on an inbound flight from Gambia.' There is no cure for Ebola, which is spread by close contact. It kills between 25 and 90 per cent of its victims. Christians in Liberia held holy communion wearing gloves to try to prevent the spread of Ebola. Early symptoms include headache, fever, fatigue, muscle pain and a sore throat . Early symptoms include headache, fever, fatigue, muscle pain and a sore throat. In the more advanced stages of the virus victims can experience skin rashes; bleeding from the eyes, nose and mouth; as well as diarrhoea, vomiting, and internal bleeding. Guidelines advise quarantining anyone who has caught the virus and disinfecting their homes. Contact with infected animals should be prevented and healthcare workers should wear protective clothing when caring for victims. The death rate from the outbreak has been constantly rising since the first case was detected in Guinea in February. More than 339 people have died in Guinea, 233 in Sierra Leone, 156 in Liberia and one in Nigeria. The World Health Organisation has said the infection rate is moving faster than efforts to control the disease, prompting fears it could spread outside the continent. A lack of border control has allowed infected people who didn’t seek medical attention because of fear, suspicion or stigma to travel freely among in West Africa. The fatality rate has been about 60 percent, and the scenes of patients bleeding from the eyes, mouth and ears has led many relatives to keep their sick family members at home instead.

"Dougie Freedman’s tenure as Nottingham Forest manager started on a positive note as goals from Danny Collins, Henri Lansbury and Ben Osborn pushed Brighton deeper into relegation trouble. The hosts had led through Lewis Dunk’s opener shortly before half-time, only for Collins to head Forest level almost immediately. Having struggled to impose themselves for long spells, Forest slowly grew in confidence after the break with Lansbury’s free-kick and Osborn’s late third putting them firmly in control. But they had to endure a nervy finale when Brighton debutant Beram Kayal headed late on and Jamaal Lascelles headed another Kayal chance off the line and onto the bar in stoppage time to preserve the points. Nottingham Forest's Ben Osborn fires the away sides third goal of the game against Brighton . Henri Lansbury finds the back of the net for Dougie Freedman's side at the Amex Stadium . Lansbury celebrates in front of the traveling away fans following his goal against Brighton . Freedman, who left his last job at Bolton by mutual consent at the start of October following a lousy start to the season, was brought in to replace Stuart Pearce in the aftermath of last weekend’s 1-0 home loss to Millwall. He quickly ripped apart an under-performing team that had slumped dramatically from league leaders at the start of the campaign. Five changes were made from Millwall, incoming were Karl Darlow, Eric Lichaj, Danny Collins, Gary Gardner and Michail Antonio. Chris Hughton, whose Seagulls side started the afternoon two points above the drop zone, replaced Jake Forster-Caskey with Liverpool loanee Joao Teixeira and Sam Baldock with Solly March after last weekend’s miserable loss at Blackpool. Freedman enjoyed the perfect start away at Brighton as Chris Houghton looks on at the Amex Stadium . Nottingham Forest's Danny Collins leaps highest to score his teams first goal of the game with a header . Freedman, wearing a club-branded jacket and tracksuit bottoms, never sat down during the entire match, standing sentinel on the edge of his technical area and frequently bellowing instructions. With just a few days available on the training ground, defending set-pieces was one area clearly not yet refined. Twice early on, Brighton players were afforded too much space inside the penalty area but twice Forest survived. First, Gordon Greer headed across the goal and off target after rising completely unchecked to meet a Danny Holla corner. Collins watches on as he waits for the ball to nestle in the net at Brighton's Amex Stadium . Then, on the quarter-hour, more slack marking from a Holla delivery allowed Dunk to leap at the back post and Darlow had to claw it to safety at point-blank range. Brighton looked much the brighter going forward, with Bruno supporting the attack at every opportunity and Kazenga LuaLua looking lively after he replaced the injured March early on. Inigo Calderon fired over the bar from just inside the box after Rohan Ince had shifted the ball to him before a Holla free-kick from about 25 yards out cracked the top of the post with Darlow well beaten by its swerve.

Scorers: Collins 43; Lansbury 63; Osborn 86 . Referee: Christopher Sarginson (Staffordshire) Attendance: 26,267 (1,727 away) The game was screaming out for a goal. In the event, it got two within the space of 120 seconds and both as a result of dubious goalkeeping. The hosts gained a deserved lead three minutes before the break. Another set-piece wide on the left from Holla caused panic in Forest ranks and, after Darlow came for it and missed completely, Dunk diverted the ball home though it may have brushed Gardner on its way in. The joy was short-lived. Barely seconds from the restart, Forest won a set-piece of their own about 10 yards in from the touchline on the left. Osborn swung it in and Collins met the ball with a header that crept in off the inside of the post. David Stockdale had come out, hesitated and was left stranded as Collins made no mistake. Brighton continued to set the pace at the beginning of the second-half and Darlow spread himself to block Teixeira’s effort following Chris O’Grady’s flick from Joe Bennett’s cross. Rohan Ince (left) of Brighton battles for the ball with Forest's Michail Antonio . It was just after the hour mark when Ince, struggling to keep pace with the burly run of Antonio, brought him down a matter of millimetres outside the box. This was a situation that spelt trouble and so it proved as Lansbury lashed the ball low through a crowded box and into the bottom corner. Suddenly the game sprung into life. At one end, Antonio headed over the bar. At the other, the dancing feet of Teixeira worked space for a shot that took a hefty deflection and crashed back off the post. Forest wrapped up victory five minutes from time when Osborn rolled in from close range after Chris Burke weaved his way between two defenders to tee him up. But there was still a nail-biting finish for the travelling fans after Kayal headed in a LuaLua corner in the final minute but Forest clung on to ensure Freedman’s perfect start.

"‘He asked me if I had played for Barcelona and when I said yes, he shook his head as if in disbelief and said, “Well, that wasn’t Barcelona football”.’ That’s Mark Hughes reflecting on a unsavoury spat with Cesc Fabregas in 2007 after the Welshman’s Blackburn side had parked the proverbial bus and ruffled a few feathers in the Arsenal ranks on the way to a 0-0 draw at Emirates Stadium. And then there’s this from February 2014 when Barcelona travelled to Manchester City in the Champions League, a match won comfortably by the Catalans with Fabregas operating as a false No 9. Below par: Fabregas has struggled to win over the Barcelona fans since his move . ‘Some people were talking a bit too much before the game and now they have to shut up for a few days,’ Fabregas told ITV. The dig aimed squarely at Jose Mourinho who had earlier referred claimed the team travelling to Manchester were the worst Barcelona for many years. The very idea then that the summer’s biggest transfer could well involve Spanish football’s prodigal son and The Beautiful Game’s bête noire seems deeply uncomfortable, not least to Arsenal fans. To the rest of the world, having Barcelona on your CV would be considered a high point. To Mourinho, it seems the spell as ‘the translator’ he spent under the tutelage of the late, great Sir Bobby Robson is a blot against his copybook of footballing ideals. These two aren’t just unrealistic bed-fellows, the argument could be made that they don’t play the same sport. Spot on: Fabregas was a vital part of the Arsenal team before leaving in 2007 . It’s been argued that Fabregas’ shortcomings in Spain are due to the fact his much-fabled ‘DNA’ had changed. He was certainly a more developed player physically than his colleagues, relying a blustering will to burst into spaces and exploit whatever tiny gaps could be found by the movement of those around him. However, touting him as a replacement for Frank Lampard seems wide of the mark. The Englishman was a master of timing without the ball – arriving late, finding a yard - Cesc was very much in his element with it as his feet. One remembers the lung-busting run from the halfway line against Tottenham in the ‘11-second derby’ or the neat exchange with Thierry Henry in order to pick the lock of the Juventus defence in 2006. Whenever he did send one crashing in from range, it was the result of his own hard work. Fabregas thrives on freedom. His genius simply wouldn’t flourish in the restrained world of Jose Mourinho.Of all the exits from the Emirates Stadium in the last half-decade, only really that of captain Cesc has passed without the vitriolic out-pouring familiar with the departure of star names. Crunch: Lampard tackles Fabregas during a Champions League game between Chelsea and Barcelona in 2012 . The young tyro had given eight years – three as captain, leader, legend - of his life and career as the heartbeat of a project whose foundations were now at their weakest. His departure to Barcelona for a knockdown $35million stuck in the throat only because of the behavior of his captors – ‘Barcelona DNA’ anyone - not through any angst towards the man himself. The Spaniard had conducted himself admirably throughout his time in north London – the odd throw of a pizza aside – and was now yearning for a return to a team being feted as perhaps the greatest we had ever seen. The fans had sent him on his way with their blessing, they had dusted themselves down and admitted defeat to a higher power. Like the girlfriend with whom you always knew you were punching above your weight, sometimes you just have to hold your hands up. Yet should Fabregas return to the Premier League, and to Chelsea, one can’t help but imagine what it would be like to see your first love arm-in-arm with a someone so at odds with what you thought made them great; an older, uglier, more unpopular partner, in whom a bulge can only be found in his wallet and his gut, the one he’s stuffed with goodies thanks to the irritatingly successful pursuit of paid-for-popularity. It’s not exactly very ‘Barcelona’; just ask Hughes.

"Riot police were deployed in Kiev today as hundreds of masked pro-Ukraine activists marched on a monastery in an attempt to strop pro-Russians holding their own rally. Protestors, many of them wearing balaclavas or scarves to hide their faces, marched outside Kiev Pechersk Lavra, a revered Orthodox . monastery in the city, which was guarded by riot police, including some officers on horseback. The activists had come to prevent pro-Russian supporters from holding their . own march at the monastery, which is under the jurisdiction of the . Moscow patriarchy. Protection: Riot police were deployed in Kiev today as hundreds of masked pro-Ukraine activists marched on a monastery in an attempt to strop pro-Russians holding their own rally . Masked: A crowd of masked Ukrainian nationalists, mostly teenagers, prepare to storm the Russian Orthodox monastery . Demonstration: Activists from various pro-Ukrainian radical youth groups shout slogans as policemen guard the entrance of the monastery . Holy site: Orthodox priests pray as police officers in riot gear guard the entrance of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra . The crowd of Ukrainian nationalists, who were mostly teenagers, had tried to get inside the monastery as they suspected it would support separatism. Priests were seen praying outside the monastery as police officers stopped the protestors from getting inside. After attempting to get inside the monastery the demonstrators then turned their attention to other Russian properties in Kiev, including a bank and the houses of Russian diplomats in Kiev. The Ukrainian Orthodox church separated from the Russian one in the early 90s, creating its own national church and accepted by the Russians as a schismatic church. On guard: Priests are seen behind a line of riot police protecting them from an aggressive crowd of Ukrainian nationalists . Split: The Ukrainian Orthodox church separated from the Russian one in the early 90s, creating its own national church and accepted by the Russians as a schismatic church . Anger: The crowd of Ukrainian nationalists, who were mostly teenagers, had tried to get inside the monastery as they suspected it would support separatism . March: The activists had come to prevent pro-Russian supporters from holding their own march at the monastery, which is under the jurisdiction of the Moscow patriarchy . The demonstration came as Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly expressed support for Ukraine's declaration of a cease-fire in its battle against pro-Russian separatists and called on both sides to negotiate a compromise. Putin said such a compromise must guarantee the rights of the Russian-speaking residents of eastern Ukraine, who must feel like they are 'an integral part' of their own country. Putin's statement appeared to signal that he sees their future in Ukraine. Separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions have declared independence and asked to join Russia. Moscow has rebuffed their appeals, but is seen by Ukraine and the West as actively supporting the insurgency. Pro-Ukraine: Protestors place their hands on their chests as they sing the Ukrainian national anthem . Shielded: Police officer cover themselves with riot shields as they guard the entrance to the place of worship . Putin's conciliatory words coincided with Russia commencing large-scale military exercises. NATO has also accused Russia of . moving troops back toward the Ukrainian border. Putin appears determined to keep up the pressure to force the Kiev government to give the eastern industrial regions more powers and to prevent Ukraine from moving too close to the European Union or NATO. But he also wants to avoid more punishing sanctions from the U.S. and particularly from the E.U., whose leaders will meet Friday in Brussels, and therefore needs to be seen as cooperating with efforts to de-escalate the conflict. The Kremlin initially dismissed the peace plan that new Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko laid out on Friday. But in a statement issued late Saturday, Putin said he welcomed the cease-fire and Poroshenko's 'intention to take other concrete steps to reach a peaceful settlement.' Horseback: Mounted police surround the monastery today . Nationalist: An Ukrainian nationalist holding his country's flag stands by as riot police hold up their shields during the demonstration . Flag waving: A masked Ukrainian nationalist waves a  flag of the Right Sector, an ultra-right nationalist organisation, during the march . As part of his plan, Poroshenko has suggested a decentralisation of power to give the regions more political authority. He also proposed new local and parliamentary elections, and measures to protect the language rights of Russian speakers in the east. Putin was more specific when he spoke publicly following ceremonies commemorating the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. 'That President Poroshenko announced a truce is without a doubt an important part of a final settlement, without which no agreement can be reached, and there is no doubt that Russia will support this intention, but in the end the most important thing is a political process,' Putin said. Armed: A Young Ukrainian nationalist holds a wooden stick behind his back as he stands in front of a row of policemen defending the houses of Russian diplomats in Kiev . Putin discussed the cease-fire on Sunday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, Merkel's office and the Kremlin said. 'After the Russian government too . referred to the cease-fire in positive terms, the interlocutors . emphasised the need for all sides to abide by it now and for a political . dialogue to be put in motion,' Merkel's office said in a statement. 'Another topic of the conversation was the issue of securing the Ukrainian-Russian border.' In . Kiev, Poroshenko also addressed his nation on the day on which . Ukrainians and Russians mourn the millions who died during World War II. He called for peace, but urged his compatriots to stand strong and . united. 'It was so during the violent struggle against the Nazis and it should be the same now,' Poroshenko said. 'Facing a real threat, we must unite even more and secure our historical choice, defend our right to live freely on our land.' Putin has appealed to both sides to halt all military operations and sit down at the negotiating table. However, It remains unclear whether the pro-Russia separatists would comply and how much pressure Russia would put on them to cease fire. Putin said today that fighting was continuing, including what he said was artillery fire from the Ukrainian side. Poroshenko has said his troops reserve the right to fire back if separatists attack them or civilians. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated sharply in February when protests in favor of closer Ukrainian ties with the European Union drove pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych from power. Russia denounced the events as a coup and annexed Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking Crimea region. Rebellion in the eastern regions broke out shortly afterward, with Ukraine accusing Russia of supporting it. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes. Action: Police guard the Sberbank of Russia building after it was attacked with stones by pro-Ukraine activists . Congregation: Worshippers leave the monastery, undeterred by the demonstrations outside .

"It was fitting and pleasing that Marcello Lippi finished his managerial career as he'd spent much of it - as a champion. With another winner's medal around his neck, the veteran Italian coach once again found himself being thrown into the air by jubilant players on a field of glory. It was not as though Lippi, well into his sixties and a World Cup winner, had anything to prove when he decided to move half-way around the world to take charge of Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande in 2012. But his well-practised philosophy burned on, as did his desire to win things. And that's precisely what he continued to do, adding three Chinese Super League titles, the Chinese FA Cup and the AFC Champions League to his already bulging trophy cabinet. Marcello Lippi secured his third straight Chinese league title and then immediately announced his retirement . Marcello Lippi won the World Cup with Italy in 2006, his side beat France in the final in Germany . Lippi, smoking one of his trademark cigars, talks to goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon after winning the World Cup . 1995: Wins Serie A, Coppa Italia and Supercopa with Juventus. 1996: Wins Champions League, European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup with Juventus. 1997: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus. 1998: Wins Serie A for third time with Juventus. 2002: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus. 2003: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus. 2006: Wins World Cup with Italy. 2012: Wins Chinese Super League and Chinese FA Cup with Guangzhou Evergrande. 2013: Wins Chinese Super League and Asian Champions League. 2014: Wins third consecutive Chinese Super League title. As another campaign ended in that familiar thrill of success, Lippi, 66, decided that it was time to call it a day. 'I don't want to coach any more, I'm too old,' he said after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Shandong Luneng, a result that won Guanzhou the league for a fourth consecutive season. 'It is my last match as a head coach for the club. Guangzhou Evergrande will have a new coach next season.' The silverware in China was a beautiful postscript to a stellar career - an extra star to take into posterity. Lippi will continue to serve as their director of football, with the former Italy and Juventus defender Fabio Cannavaro favourite to take his job. Lippi coached for 32 years, starting out in the Italian lower divisions and climbing the ladder to win five Scudettos and the Champions League with Juventus. But he topped all that when he led Italy, against all expectations, to World Cup success in Germany in 2006. In so doing, he became the first coach to have won both the Champions League and the World Cup, a feat later matched by Vicente del Bosque in 2010. As a player, Lippi was a Libero - a sweeper - in the classic Italian tradition. Between 1969 and 1979, he played 274 league matches for Sampdoria. Success was modest and Lippi retired from playing at the age of 34 to embark on a coaching career. The year was 1982, the year in which Italy won the World Cup. Perhaps his later success was written in the stars. Lippi will become technical director of Guangzhou Evergrande, the team he has been managing since 2012 . Lippi won five Serie A titles with Juventus as well as the Champions League and Coppa Italia and Supercopa . Lippi in his familiar position in the dug-out while in charge of Inter Milan . The young coach served a thorough apprenticeship with some of Italy's less glamorous clubs, including Pontedera, Siena, Pistiese, Carrarese, Cesena and Lucchese before he rocked up at Napoli in 1993. This was a club that had worshipped Diego Maradona just a few years earlier but had fallen on hard times. Lippi restored some of their pride, defying a shoestring budget to guide them into the UEFA Cup. It was an achievement that caught the eye of giants Juventus, with whom he spent five seasons between 1994 and 1999, guiding them to the pinnacle of both the Italian and European games. He forged a great Bianconeri team - this was the era of Gianluca Vialli, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Didier Deschamps, Ciro Ferrar, Antonio Conte, Zinedine Zidane, Christian Vieri and Alen Boksic. Lippi led them to the title in 1995, 1997 and 1998. They lost the 1995 UEFA Cup final to a Dino Baggio-inspired Parma but roared back to claim the Champions League 12 months later, beating Ajax on penalties at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Juventus were the example for every European team - they were united, hard working, organised and deadly on the counter-attack.

Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, feeling their way back into Europe's top competition as they started to dominate the Premier League, had the misfortune to encounter Lippi's Juventus in consecutive seasons. Their September 1996 meeting at the Stadio delle Alpi was men against boys as Juventus peppered Peter Schmeichel's goal. It was miraculous United only lost by one, as they also did at Old Trafford later that season. 'Juventus were an example for my Manchester United,' Ferguson later revealed. 'I had my players watch videos of Lippi's team and would say: 'Don't look at the tactics or technique, we had that too; you need to learn to have that desire to win.' Indeed, Lippi outlined his coaching philosophy in a book called A Game of Ideas: Thoughts and Passions from the Sidelines. He emphasised togetherness and team spirit. A team could be greater than the sum of its parts. He likened a playing squad to a family, stressing the importance of everyone getting along. Despite that early success, they fell short in Europe too - losing 3-1 to Borussia Dortmund in the 1997 final in Munich and 1-0 to Real Madrid in Amsterdam a year later.

Even United finally conquered them - in the 1999 semi-finals - but by that time Lippi had departed and Carlo Ancelotti was in the opposition dug-out. After an unsuccessful season at Inter Milan, Lippi returned to Turin in 2001, winning the Scudetto at the first attempt on a dramatic final day. He guided them to a fourth Champions League final 12 months later, only for Milan to win on penalties at Old Trafford. The truth is that Lippi could have won more. He was appointed manager of Italy in 2004, replacing Giovanni Trapattoni. They approached the 2006 World Cup at a low ebb as sordid details emerged of the Calciopoli scandal, in which Lippi was questioned but cleared. Despite such low expectations, Italy prospered, beating hosts Germany in a classic semi-final in Dortmund and then defeating France on penalties in the Berlin final, forever remembered for Zidane's headbutt on Marco Materazzi.

It was a quite astonishing success and Lippi celebrated in his own inimitable way, by watching a re-run of the whole match alone in his hotel suite while smoking a victory cigar. With hindsight, Lippi should have ended on a high right there and then. He returned to lead to Azzurri at the 2010 finals in South Africa but the team were a shambles. They drew with Paraguay and New Zealand before losing to Slovakia, recording their worst World Cup performance since 1966. Lippi resigned after the Slovakia loss. That led to his final chapter in Guangzhou which is now drawing to a close. The curtain closing on a quite extraordinary career that saw Lippi enjoy sustained success with a coaching philosophy that will endure as a manual for managers the world over.","Marcello Lippi retired from football management at the weekend .

"Gary Hooper recorded his first hat-trick in Norwich City colours to steer his side to a comfortable 4-0 win over Championship basement boys Blackpool. The former Celtic man struck twice in the first half before adding a penalty after the break as the class gap between the two sides was ruthlessly emphasised. A fourth eventually arrived in injury-time courtesy of a superb free-kick from Nathan Redmond to round off a thoroughly professional performance from the Canaries. Gary Hooper recorded his first hat-trick in Norwich City colours to steer his side to a 4-0 win over Blackpool . A third win since the arrival of Alex Neil saw Norwich close in on the play-off positions, while their opponents remain marooned at the foot of the table after a 10th away defeat of a miserable campaign. After taking a while to settle, the home side had an early chance to take the lead when Lewis Grabban latched on to a hopeful through ball but he scuffed his shot and Elliot Parish comfortably gathered. At the other end Blackpool posed the occasional threat with Steve Davies sending a header straight at John Ruddy, but it came as little surprise when Norwich struck after 12 minutes. Blackpool remain two points adrift at the bottom of the Championship table . Jonny Howson threaded a delightful pass through a square Blackpool defence and Hooper coolly slid the ball home for his sixth goal of the season. The Canaries suffered a setback when Sebastien Bassong, who was making only his second appearance of the season, hobbled off with a back injury, to be replaced by Michael Turner. But they continued to put their lowly opponents under pressure and went 2-0 midway through the first half with a beautifully crafted goal. City worked the ball skilfully into the box where Hooper played a delightful one-two with Wes Hoolahan before emphatically doubling his tally for the afternoon. It was nearly 3-0 when a Grabban effort was tipped onto the bar by Parish before Peter Clarke cleared the danger, while the Norwich striker was guilty of a bad miss when he skied Howson's inviting cross over from close range. Norwich City winger Nathan Redmond scored the final goal of the match late on . The Canaries put the game to bed 11 minutes into the second half when Hooper completed his hat-trick from the spot. The penalty was awarded for a clear foul by Clarke on Grabban and Hooper stepped up to send Parish the wrong way for his third goal of the day. It was now merely a question of how many a dominant Norwich would score against their struggling opponents and it needed an excellent stop from Parish to prevent Grabban from adding another moments later. As it turned out the hosts rarely threatened after that until Redmond's stunning free-kick from 25 yards out - while it took a superb reflex stop from Ruddy to prevent Davies volleying home a consolation.

"Tom Ince scored his first league goals for a year as Derby stayed joint top of the Sky Bet Championship with a convincing 4-1 victory over Bolton Wanderers at the iPro Stadium. Ince celebrated his Derby debut with a superbly struck free-kick and another clinical finish and with midfielder Jeff Hendrick also scoring twice, the Rams were too good for Bolton who could only reply through substitute Filip Twardzik. Derby drafted Ince straight into the team following his loan move from Hull and he almost set up a goal in the 11th minute with a low cross from the right that fizzed across the six-yard box. Tom Ince scored his first league goals for a year as Derby beat Bolton on Saturday afternoon . But Bolton were getting plenty of possession and they gave Derby a scare in the 26th minute when a clever pass by Zach Clough played Liam Feeney in but Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant was quickly off his line to cut out the danger. The visitors had worked hard to deny Derby space but in the 33rd minute, Omar Mascarell sent Hendrick running into the penalty area to set up Ince but his shot was blocked. But Ince made his mark on the match in the 39th minute when he curled a superb free-kick from the right edge of the area into the top left corner of Andy Lonergan's goal after Liam Trotter had bundled over Chris Martin. Ince scores his first goal of the afternoon during the Championship clash . The former Blackpool midfielder scores his second goal of the afternoon at the iPro Stadium . Ince lobbed just wide from Mascarell's pass but Derby scored again in the 45th minute when Will Hughes cut the ball inside from the right and Hendrick spun away from Josh Vela before firing low past Lonergan from 12 yards. Bolton boss Neil Lennon made two changes at the start of the second half but his side fell further behind in the 47th minute. Derby worked the ball in from the left and when Martin played in Hughes, the midfielder picked out the unmarked Ince who thundered a shot past Lonergan from 12 yards. But one of those substitutions gave Bolton a glimmer of hope in the 51st minute when a free-kick from Barry Bannan was knocked down and Twardzik dived to head low past Grant's right hand. Jeff Hendrick also scored a brace during the Rams' win on Saturday afternoon . Derby boss Steve McClaren (left) smiles while Bolton manager Neil Lennon (right) looks dejected . It was a reminder the game was not over although Derby almost restored their three-goal cushion when a quick exchange of passes ended with Jamie Ward driving in a low shot from the edge of the area that was only just pushed away by Lonergan. But Derby threatened more goals and the fourth arrived in the 68th minute when a Mascarell free-kick was headed back by Jake Buxton and Hendrick was unmarked to head in from two yards. Clough forced Grant into a diving save but Ince rattled a post in stoppage time as Derby warmed up for Tuesday night's top-of-the-table clash at Bournemouth in perfect fashion.","Tom Ince scored a brace as Derby County beat Bolton Wanderers .

"Two tries in three minutes while Leonardo Ghiraldini was in the sin-bin saved Ireland before they beat Italy 26-3 at the start of their RBS 6 Nations title defence. Conor Murray and Tommy O'Donnell sneaked scores while hooker Ghiraldini was off the field, after Ireland had laboured with scant return in a tryless first hour. Sean O'Brien suffered a hamstring injury in the warm-up, so the luckless Leinster flanker's wait for his first Test action since November 2013 goes on. Ireland scrum half Conor Murray burrows over for his side's opening try following a powerful maul from the pack .

Conversions: Keatley (1), Madigan (1) Penalties: Keatley (3) The 27-year-old will now be an automatic doubt for Ireland's second-round clash with France in Dublin next weekend. O'Brien has only just recovered from 14 months battling two consecutive shoulder reconstructions, and the 30-cap loose-forward cut a disconsolate and broody figure on Ireland's bench. Ireland's management were just as stern-faced despite victory, because the visitors never found any control or fluency at the Stadio Olimpico. Italy lost all five Six Nations matches last year, and Ireland thumped the Azzurri 46-7 in Dublin: there would be no repeat this time. Ian Keatley landed four penalties and a conversion but failed to seize his chance to prove he deserves more time in Ireland's 10 shirt. The Munster fly-half was unable to boss his backline, all too often standing all too deep in attack: fit-again Johnny Sexton will doubtless return against France next weekend after 12 weeks missing with concussion. Ireland may live to regret not racking up a bigger score against the lowly Italians, who tend to crack as tournaments progress. Should this year's Six Nations come down to points difference, just as last year, the Irish may rue not pushing the envelope somewhat once this game broke up. All the fizzing electricity from England's tournament opening 21-16 win over Wales in Cardiff turned to dismal static in a humdrum first-half in Rome. Robbie Henshaw, making his Six Nations debut for Ireland, makes some early inroads into the Italian defence in Rome . Where Wales sparkled and England shone, Ireland could only glower in the gloom of uninspired, guileless first-half attacking play. Italy proved the architects of their own discomfort right from the off, Matias Aguero penalised for slipping his bind at the scrum. George Biagi's cheap knock-on gifted Ireland field position, and a pointless midfield offside allowed Keatley to open the scoring from the tee. Jack McGrath atoned for conceding a scrum penalty by winning a fine choke-tackle turnover, in tandem with Peter O'Mahony. Keatley endured a mixed opening, slotting his penalty calmly, but throwing a loose pass and also being charged down by Michele Campagnaro. Azzurri scrum half Edoardo Gori loses the ball under pressure from opposite number Murray (left) Keatley doubled his and Ireland's tally after Luke McLean wandered offside to retrieve Andrea Masi's knock-on. Ireland drove close from a lineout maul, but Tommy Bowe could not tap Murray's deft chip back inside with enough space for the scrum-half to wriggle home. The visitors had to settle instead for Keatley's third penalty of the afternoon. Italy then set camp in Ireland's 22 but after one driving maul Kelly Haimona opted to strike at goal. The New Zealand-born fly-half landed the goal to cut Italy's deficit to six points at the break. Ireland started the second half searching for some kind of fuel injection, but still their attack misfired. Italy captain Sergio Parisse drives forward as Ireland full back Rob Kearney tries to halt the No 8's progress . Keatley produced a neat half-break on the blindside, only to force an attempted last pass: Campagnaro knocked on trying to intercept, allowing Ireland a quick wipe of the brow. Keatley almost cut the line again in Italy's 22, but Sergio Parisse produced a fine ruck steal to ease the pressure. Jared Payne raced close after Simon Zebo's neat wide pass, but Robbie Henshaw knocked on trying to sneak through. Payne and Henshaw noticeably picked up the pace after the break, but again Ireland turned to Keatley's boot to extend their lead to 12-3. Ireland dispensed with posting penalties instead chasing the jugular just past the hour, punting to the corner for an attacking lineout.

Italy winger Luke McLean (left) competes for a high ball with Ireland and Ulster three-quarter Tommy Bowe . Ghiraldini spoiled Ireland's maul from an offside position and was duly sin-binned for his troubles. Ireland went straight for the lineout once more, and finally broke the try deadlock. Murray wriggled home after the pack drove to the whitewash, with Keatley converting for a 19-3 lead. No sooner had Ireland scored than boss Joe Schmidt brought off Keatley, Paul O'Connell and Peter O'Mahoney, no doubt with one eye on next weekend's France clash. Ireland dominate possession and territory but cannot break the stubborn Italian defence in the opening 60 minutes as Kearney makes a charge .

Tommy O'Donnell then raced through Italy's porous midfield to rubber-stamp Ireland's victory. Ian Madigan slotted the conversion to gloss the scoreline, but Ireland were unable to maintain that momentum once Italy were restored to full complement. Italy's rally forced Ireland to defend with zeal and composure at the death when Schmidt's men would sooner have been attempting to boost their points-difference tally. Andrea Manici's sloppy spilled ball dented Italy's momentum, before Haimona had a try ruled out for the slightest of knock-ons from Parisse.","Ian Keatley kicks 14 points on his Six Nations debut .

"Size 16 model Jennie Runk made waves last month posing for H&M's summer swimwear campaign. The 5.10"" brunette was hired by the high street brand to show off the range of larger sizes that their beachwear collections come in (U.S. sizes 14-24) and the shots caused a stir because there was no obvious reference to the fabulous looking model's size anywhere on the ads. The collection was . simply presented to customers as 'this season's new swimwear'. The only . clue alluding to the line's larger sizing was a small '+' sign sitting to the right of H&M's logo. Jennie has been modelling full time since 2011, after gaining 20lbs on the advice of a scout who spotted her volunteering at her local pet store as a teenager. She is now using her new found fame as an opportunity to promote positive body confidence in young women. Size 16 model Jennie Runk made waves in the recent H&M campaign and is now using her fame to promote body confidence in young girls . Jennie has been modelling full time since 2011, when she gained 20lbs on the advice of a scout . She told the BBC: 'I was given the option to lose weight and try to maintain a size four . (a UK six or eight), or to gain a little - maintain a size 10 (a UK 12 . or 14) - and start a career as a plus-size model. I knew my body was . never meant to be a size four, so I went with plus. 'People assume ""plus"" equates to fat, which in turn equates to ugly. This . is completely absurd.' The 24-year-old from Missouri, has . received thank you messages from lots of new fans since appearing in the H&M campaign who say that her confidence . has inspired them to try on a bikini for the first time in years. She said: 'I found it strange that people made . such a fuss about how my body looks in a bikini, since I don't usually . give it much thought but this is exactly the kind of . thing I've always wanted to accomplish, showing women that it's OK to be . confident even if you're not the popular notion of ""perfect"". 'This . message is especially important for teenage girls. Being a teenage girl . is incredibly difficult. They need all the help and support they can . get.' The H&M campaign didn't make any reference to Jennie's size and she says that it's time we all stop obsessing about body shape . Jennie is on the books of the prestigious Ford Models agency in New York . Now on the books of New York's prestigious Ford Models Jennie admits . that she found her teenage years difficult. She was 5ft 9in and a size . 12 by the time she was 13 and envied the smaller girls at school. Her . thick, curly hair, braces and wire-rimmed glasses drew more unwanted . attention and she now wants to show young women that it is acceptable to . be different and that they will grow out of that awful awkwardness. She says: 'Just focus on being the . best possible version of yourself and quit worrying about your thighs, . there's nothing wrong with them. There's no need to glamorise one body . type and slam another. 'We need to stop this absurd hatred towards bodies . for being different sizes. It doesn't help anyone and it's getting . old.' Her Facebook page gained 2,000 new 'likes'  in 24 hours once the campaign launched (she now has over 3000 likes on the social networking site) Following her appearance in the H&M adverts  Jezebel's Jenna Sauers praised the brand's choice of model, writing that she hoped it is a step . towards viewing normal-sized models as matter of course, rather than . continuing to see them pigeonholed into 'plus-size' classifications. She said: 'I . think it sends a positive message about inclusivity and changing . standards of beauty. 'Seeing plus-size bodies in fashion spreads and ads should be as common as seeing anything else.' Cuistomers too praised the mega retailer, with some writing 'thank you' notes to H&M's marketing department. One woman posted an open letter to . H&M in Jezebel's comments section, writing: 'Thank you so much for . using Jennie Runk as your beachwear page covergirl.

"Jose Mourinho gave his humiliated Chelsea stars the silent treatment following their shock FA Cup loss to Bradford. The Blues were left shell-shocked after relinquishing a 2-0 lead to concede four against the League One side. Mourinho headed into the Bradford dressing room to congratulate Phil Parkinson's side following their historic victory. Jose Mourinho did not say a word to his Chelsea players after their FA Cup defeat by Bradford City . Bradford's players celebrate after dumping Chelsea out of the FA Cup at the fourth round stage . 4 - Bradford became the fourth opponents to score four goals against a team coached by Mourinho after Barcelona (2010, 0-5), Borussia Dortmund (2013, 1-4) and Tottenham (2015, 3-5). The Bantams are the first team ever to do it away from home. 2008 - The last time Chelsea lost to a lower league team in the FA Cup was against Barnsley in 2008. Jon Stead has scored four goals and assisted four in his last five FA Cup games. 1 - This is the first time Chelsea have conceded more than two goals at home this season in all competitions. £7,500 - Striker James Hanson is the only Bradford player to command a fee, £7,500. In contrast, Chelsea’s starting line-up cost a whopping £101million. 10 - Mourinho’s side have conceded 10 goals in 2015 — only four teams in the Premier League, Championship, League One and League Two have let in more in the same period. Former Chelsea winger Filipe Morais  has scored three goals and provided two assists in his last five FA Cup games for Bradford. 1958 - Chelsea conceded four goals to a third-tier team for the first time since 1958, when they lost 4-1 to Darlington — the goals coming from Tommy Moran (two), Ron Harbertson and Dave Carr. But his mood towards his own players was far less complimentary. 'What did I say to the players? Nothing. Not a word,' said Mourinho. 'It wasn't a moment to speak to them.' Instead, Mourinho used Sunday's scheduled warm down training session at the club's Cobham HQ to begin the inquest into the defeat. The Chelsea manager was at his desk by 8am on Sunday ahead of his players' arrival. His first priority was to ensure there is not a lingering hangover following Saturday's embarrassing loss with tomorrow's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg clash against Liverpool looming. 'I don't think they played poorly — the way they arrived to 2-0 looked quite comfortable. The goal they scored after forty something minutes got them into the game and after that there are things difficult to explain. 'Goals we missed, goals we concede. Do I blame myself for this? (I blame myself) the same as the players. I think we should share between us. But if I am the boss, the boss has more responsibilities. 'Maybe the players switched off after going 2-0 up. But at half-time it was 2-1 and then we spoke about the danger of the situation. We spoke about how they play, we repeated at half-time what we spoke in the preparation of the match. 'Maybe you don't believe but we prepared in the same way we prepare for a Premier League match, the same power point presentation, same analysis, the same information, we prepare exactly the same way. 'We respect them — at least I respect them — in the way we prepared for the game but at half-time the players thought 'We are going to score, not them' and when they scored for 2-2, after that the game became crazy.' Chelsea captain John Terry was left on the bench but Mourinho's insists his side didn't miss his leadership . Mourinho is now preparing to face Liverpool after drawing 1-1 in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final . Without key-defensive trio John Terry, Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic, who were all rested, the Blues struggled to stem the flow of Bradford's second-half momentum. But Mourinho insists he still has faith in his squad despite losing. 'Did we miss Terry's leadership? No,' said the Portuguese. 'We played lots of games without John. We played almost every Cup game without John. We played Bolton, Shrewsbury and Watford without John and the team coped well with the situation. 'I trust my squad. It is not because of this disappointment and this bad performance that I am going to change. Chelsea's players are left dejected after Bradford staged a stunning comeback to progress in the FA Cup . Felipe Morais (right) celebrates making it 2-2 as Cesar Azpilicueta and Petr Cech look on helplessly . 'It is easy for you to understand now why I play almost every game with the same players. I don't make many changes. 'I try to keep stability in the team. Maybe now you can understand a bit better why. I don't want to speak too much about it. This is my squad — let's move on. 'This result doesn't alter may plans in the transfer market. I'm happy to go with the squad I have. This is Chelsea always thinking and being proud of thinking of numbers and Financial Fair Play and so on. 'We cannot now go to the market and spend money. I am completely with the club. I share this idea. I don't think we are going to the market, unless someone makes a market with us.'","Chelsea squandered a two-goal lead at home to Bradford on Saturday .

"Jermain Defoe's first-half goal against Swansea on Saturday meant that the 33-year-old became the first player to have netted against all 20 of the current Premier League sides. Defoe joined Sunderland from MLS side Toronto FC during the January transfer window, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal, and there were concerns that the 33-year-old might be past his best. But in five games for Sunderland, the striker has notched two goals and his predator instincts in and around the box certainly do not appear to be on the wane.

"Charlie Austin and Richard Dunne could be out for the rest of the season after the Queens Park Rangers duo left Loftus Road on crutches on Saturday. Austin, the club's top goalscorer, is understood to have broken a bone in his right foot following the 1-0 defeat against Southampton that left QPR second bottom of the Barclays Premier League. The 25-year-old played the full 90 minutes against Southampton but was in discomfort as he left the ground. QPR striker and top goalscorer Charlie Austin could be out with injury for the rest of the season . QPR could also be without experienced defender Richard Dunne who suffered a knee injury . Austin has been in superb form for The Hoops this season and has scored 13 goals in 19 league games . Dunne twisted his knee and had to be substituted in the 83rd minute after a block tackle on Southampton's Sadio Mane, who scored the winner for the visitors in the 93rd minute. QPR would not discuss the extent of the damage to either player but Austin and Dunne will undergo scans ahead of Tuesday night's visit to the Stadium of Light to face Sunderland. Caretaker manager Chris Ramsey expects to remain in temporary charge, though Tim Sherwood is still favourite to take over following Harry Redknapp's departure. Austin's absence would be nothing short of a disaster for the struggling club after the England hopeful contributed 13 goals in the Premier league this season – just one behind Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and four behind Chelsea's Diego Costa.

"Thibaut Courtois has backed Chelsea to go all the way this season, claiming they have a team good enough to win the quadruple. Jose Mourinho's side are still in the Capital One Cup, the FA Cup, the Champions League, and are top of the Premier League, giving Chelsea's No 1 keeper hope that they can achieve the maximum. 'It's difficult to say if we could win all four but we are playing well,' Courtois said. 'We have passed through all competitions. Thibaut Courtois is confident that Chelsea have a team good enough to win the quadruple this season . There are a number of first-team players yet to experience winning a trophy at Chelsea, including Courtois . 'Now we are in the semi-final of the Capital One Cup, are top of the league, there is an important game in the FA Cup on Saturday which we have to win and soon we will be playing PSG in the Champions League. 'It will be hard but we have the team that can win everything. It's what we're aiming for.' There are players in Chelsea's squad who have never won a trophy in west London, Courtois included. Last summer's signings Diego Costa, Felipe Luis and Cesc Fabregas are hoping to taste success in their first season as Courtois added: 'Myself, Costa, Filipe, Fabregas and the rest of the team want to win trophies for Chelsea. That starts in the League Cup to the last game in the Champions League. Jose Mourinho did not win a trophy in his first season back at the Bridge, but could put that right this season . Chelsea's last trophy came under Rafa Benitez when they won the Europa League in May 2013 . 'We want to win everything, it will be difficult, but I think we have the team to do it. Hopefully we can achieve it.' Chelsea's next test on the road to quadruple success comes against Bradford on Saturday; on paper, one of the easier ties they will face in the second half of the season. Indeed, Paris Saint- Germain are their opponents in the next stage of the Champions League. A 1-1 draw in the semi-final first leg of the Capital One Cup at Anfield on Tuesday night gave the Blues confidence that they will be able to take Liverpool back to London next week and beat them. Diego Costa has been one of Chelsea's main men this season and leads the Premier League scoring charts . If Chelsea beat Liverpool next week, they will set up their first Wembley fixture since the FA Cup in May 2012 . That will set up a first Wembley final of the season, against either Tottenham or Sheffield United, and Courtois believes one final spur them on. 'If you play a final and win it, you get that feeling to win trophies and you want to win more and more and more. That feeling is in the whole group now, especially after what happened last season when they didn't win anything and were close to some trophies. 'You want to win everything that's possible, starting with the League Cup.'","Chelsea are top of the Premier League and in every other competition .

"Jose Mourinho won for the first time at Villa Park after five previous visits without a victory, while the home side ended the fourth-longest goal drought in Premier League history. But it seems some things never change. The Mourinho camp was accused of being verbally abusive by Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert following a bad tempered exchange between the two dugouts in the first half of this thrusting encounter. Lambert threw his overcoat to the ground after someone on the opposite bench made a remark towards him midway through the half. ‘It was something said but not by Jose,’ said Lambert. ‘He is a great manager, it is fantastic what the guy has done, I would love to learn from him as football manager but I wouldn’t like to learn things off the pitch from somebody in his dugout. I don’t know what was said - I don’t speak Portuguese, maybe he doesn’t speak Glaswegian.’ Aston Villa boss Lambert (left) and Chelsea counterpart Jose Mourinho  shout instructions from the touchline . Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic celebrates scoring the Blues' winner at Villa Park on Saturday . Ivanovic (left) smashes home Chelsea's second goal against Aston Villa with his left foot . Lambert also accused Mourinho of trying to ‘put pressure’ on him by calling the Villa squad, who are without a win at home in the league since early December, one of the best in the top tier. ‘I analyse teams by the quality of players and Villa have one of the best squads, very good players and a very good bench, lots of solutions.’ He even praised the home fans. ‘Maybe he is trying to put pressure on me, I don’t know,’ swiped Lambert, who also noted Mourinho was already ‘halfway down the pitch’ when he went to shake his hand at the end of the game. Some animosity perhaps remains between the pair after Lambert refused to shake Mourinho’s hand when he attempted to leave the pitch before the final whistle when the sides met at Stamford Bridge earlier in the season, a game won 3-0 by Chelsea. After a frosty encounter with journalists earlier in the week, Mourinho was notably subdued throughout the match, rarely straying from the dugout, except to celebrate Eden Hazard’s opening goal and Branislav Ivanovic’s superb winner. But at the final whistle, the Portuguese marched towards the travelling supporters in the Doug Ellis Stand and asked them for more applause. On the day main rivals Manchester City drew with Hull, did he sense this was the day Chelsea, who extended their lead at the top of the table to seven points, ran away with the title? Apparently not. Jores Okore (right) of  celebrates with  Carles Gil after scoring Villa's first league goal in exactly 11 hours . Okore and Ciaran Clark run over to the Villa supporters to celebrate scoring the goal which ended the drought . ‘In another country I would say fantastic,’ said Mourinho, ‘in this country I would say it is difficult, every game is difficult. We still have 14 games left and 42 points to play for. I think it’s nothing. I am surprised with nothing. Somebody told me city’s result after the game but it doesn’t matter. When you are top of the league you don’t need other teams to lose points.’ Lambert was optimistic despite a fourth straight defeat and said a major psychological weight had been lifted by Jores Okore headed goal in the 48th minute, which ended a barren spell in the top flight of 660 minutes. The assist came from Carles Gil, who on early impressions looks good value for the £3.25million paid to Valencia for him. The Spaniard beat Oscar down the right flank and whipped an arching ball into the box for Okore to pounce on. ‘Getting a goal is a big moment for us,’ said Lambert, ‘If we get into a run of games where we play like that hopefully we can pick up a lot of points. It’s not just about getting 17th we want to get up as high as we can. I just told the players that in the dressing room. We were up against team who will be close to winning the Champions League so it was a good performance for us.’ Eden Hazard slides and clenches his fists in celebration after putting Chelsea ahead against Villa on Saturday . Hazard (centre) pokes the ball home as Villa defenders look on agonisingly as the home side fall behind . Chelsea, without Diego Costa, serving the second of a three match ban for an apparent stamp on Liverpool’s Emre Can, and the injured Cesc Fabregas, hit their stride quickly. Eden Hazard put them ahead after just eight minutes. Oscar neatly brought the ball to his feet and supplied Willian whose angled ball into the box was slotted neatly past Brad Guzan by the Belgian. After equalizing through Okore, the home fans erupted into a chorus of ‘we score when we want’ but 20 minutes later order was restored as Branislav Ivanovic nabbed the winner. The ever reliable Serb struck sweetly with his right foot inside the box, firing into the top corner after Okore and Fabian Delph failed to clear a Cesar Azpilicueta cross. Chelsea’s new signing Juan Cuadrado was also given a run out for the final 16 minutes.

"Whatever else Jermain Defoe achieves in his return to English football, he has found a way to get Gus Poyet smiling again. It's barely been a week since Sunderland's Uruguayan manager had a good moan about results and performances that he even he found ugly. What a difference a few days can make. What a difference this particular striker can make. His second goal in three Premier League fixtures wasn't enough to win this one - Ki Sung-Yeung saw to that against with an equaliser against the side he inspired on loan last season - but it has given his manager cause to think of brighter times.

But that noise will have dimmed after his goal in the win over Burnley last weekend and it will have surely disappeared altogether after his magnificent strike in the first half at Swansea. As it happens, it was a goal that meant he is the only player to have scored against all 20 of the current Premier League clubs. But more than racking up statistics, the striker is showing the form that ought to keep Sunderland safe. It's why Poyet faces a dilemma. He said: 'Without any doubt we are a different team with him. When you have a player who you know sooner or later will score it makes a difference.

'I have been killing myself thinking if I need to give him a rest. He hasn't played in four months. But sorry, Jermain, I can't. 'The idea is to not take risk but I can't let games go past without playing Jermain. From our first conversation, over whether it was it too early to make a start against Tottenham (in his debut), he never had a doubt. He always wants to play.' Naturally, talk has already talked to the possibility of an England call up. Poyet added: 'When you pick strikers you pick those in form and scoring goals. We saw Harry Kane against Arsenal - it's an obvious choice. Jermain has a chance if Wayne Rooney plays in midfield. But that's up to Roy Hodgson.'

Jermain Defoe's goal against Swansea means that the striker has now scored against every current Premier League side. For Garry Monk, the frustration was obvious. Aside from the goal they conceded, this was a game Swansea largely dominated. Bafetimbi Gomis was denied after going clean through at the end of a delightful six-man, first-half move and Ki also had a goal disallowed. Almost immediately, Defoe took possession just inside Swansea's half and easily beat Federico Fernandez before finishing from 20 yards. Ki levelled after the break, but Monk said: 'It was frustrating. We had enough good chances to take the points. The only shot they had was the goal - we gave Defoe too much space.' On Ki's disallowed goal, Monk added: 'I was told his hairline was offside, although I am not sure that is part of the rules. I will have to tell Ki to cut his hair.'

Having beaten both Aston Villa and Hull since Christmas, it could be argued that his team have got the message despite the continuing danger of anger of being cast adrift at the bottom of the table. If only FA Cup results counted in the Premier League. Leicester have knocked out top flight opposition in Newcastle and Spurs and next weekend bid to make it a hat-trick against Villa. Sadly, back in the real world, it has been a season of toil for Pearson’s players, not helped by a dismal home record of two wins in the league. The Thai owners continue to back their manager, to the extent that he was able to splash out a record £9.7million on striker Andrej Kramaric, who was named substitute. This was an opportunity to sign off from the King Power in style – a quirk of the fixture list plus Chelsea’s Capital One Cup final means that the next time the Foxes are at home is the middle of March. First on the agenda was avoiding a third straight league defeat against a side who have been resurgent under Alan Pardew. The bandwagon hit a pot hole last week when Everton mugged Palace and left south London with all three points. Pardew’s 100 per cent win record suffered a first dent but they still started this match in 13th place and with 23 points safely gathered in. Confidence has risen and the way Palace started proved that. The first 10 minutes was all about the visitors with Jordon Mutch looking to join striker Dwight Gayle at every opportunity. Decent build-up play did not equate to a real threat on Mark Schwarzer’s goal, though, and gradually Leicester came into the game. Leicester goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer was unable to keep out Ledley's headed effort . Leicester striker David Nugent came close to scoring for Leicester however his header hit the woodwork . Chief tormentor Riyad Mahrez has been at the African Cup of Nations with Algeria. From the heat of Equatorial Guinea to the chill of the Midlands but Mahrez’s only concession to the cold was gloves with his short-sleeved short. More importantly, he looked in hot form and was at the centre of most of Leicester’s attacking moves. Twice he set up David Nugent only for the striker to slice his shot-come-chip over and then Nugent headed Mahrez’s corner against the bar. And when the winger tried a shot himself, Julian Speroni did his job in the Palace goal before Scott Dann blocked Nugent’s follow-up. Speroni, in his bright green kit, was far the busier goalkeeper and kept his team on even terms with a stop to deny Jeffrey Schlupp. As the home side launched attack after attack,  Dann and Wes Morgan both went up in an aerial challenge and cracked heads. Both went down pole-axed and it was no surprise when Dann failed to reappear for the second half. Pardew made two substitutions and both were involved in Palace’s opener. Having lived dangerously when Paul Konchesky’s low shot skimmed a post, the visitors hit back. Sub one, Yaya Sanogo, who forced a block from Marcin Wasilewski, won a corner, which was taken by Dwight Gayle. Sub two, Brede Hangeland, used his height to head Gayle’s flag kick back across the area and Ledley got the final touch for only his second league goal of the season. Leicester had a chance to equalise immediately but Esteban Cambiasso paid the price for dithering and his shot was cleared. Speroni turned out to be just as busy in the second half as the first and made one world-class stop from Jamie Vardy right at the end.

"The jokes can finally end. Aston Villa have scored in the Premier League. At the eleventh hour. Literally.

Still, it was not enough to stop Chelsea. Suppose that is another punchline of sorts. You wait 11 hours for a goal and still get beat. It is tough being a Villa fan these days. Jose Mourinho enjoyed his first victory at Villa Park at the sixth attempt thanks to a thunderous response by Branislav Ivanovic. As a defender, perhaps he felt personally slighted that English football’s worst attack had got the ball over the line against him. Twenty minutes after Villa stunned their supporters into jovially singing ‘We score when we want’ the Serbian went down the other end and won the three points for Chelsea. In the 68th minute, Cesar Azpilicueta advanced down the left and was only partially stopped by Okore. The Danish defender then failed woefully with a clearance, allowing Azpiliceuta to dig out a cross.

Fabian Delph missed the ball but Ivanovic did not, striking a magnificent half-volley with his left foot into the net before Brad Guzan had time to think. Mourinho, who had remained in his seat throughout, stood up to celebrate. The travelling fans clambered over themselves to do likewise with the mound of Chelsea players cheering in front of them. An important victory clinched on the path to what Chelsea hope is a first Premier League title since 2009-10. The win had appeared certain when Eden Hazard continued his fine form by opening the scoring in the eighth minute. Oscar ran down the right and played the ball across to Willian, who took a touch and fed a delightful pass into the area. Hazard galloped on to it and swept a first-time finish into the corner.

New Chelsea signing Juan Cuadrado sits on the bench watching the first half of the Premier League clash . Given Villa’s impotence in attack - sharing the lowest goal total of any team from the Premier League era at this stage of the season - that seemed to be that. Lambert had made the call to drop Christian Benteke following his poor showings in recent weeks, even if the Belgian was the last to score in a claret and blue shirt in the 1-1 draw with Manchester United on December 20. Gabby Agbonlahor started instead, in the aim of giving more mobility and speed for counter attacks. It nearly went right when he connected with Delph’s cross, only to head over. He had not heeded the signs carrying arrows held aloft by some fans. Handed out by a betting firm known for their ambush marketing before kick-off, the idea was to point the way to goal for their players.

Gradually though, Villa found a foothold and produced a few moments to worry John Terry and his fellow defenders. Shortly before interval it became tetchy on the sidelines when Didier Drogba fell to floor holding his head after an aerial duel with Ciaran Clark. Lambert removed his coat and exchanged words with the rival dugout. At Stamford Bridge earlier in the season the Villa manager was infuriated by Mourinho’s attempts to shake his hand before the final whistle. Here, the Portuguese stayed in his seat. Three minutes after the interval, Villa found that longed-for breakthrough. It really was some skill by Gil, who enjoyed another good game since his £3.25million move from Valencia.

Willian twice went close with slapped shots from range, the second requiring the slenderest of fingertips from Guzan to divert wide. Another blue attack reasserted the visitor’s authority. As soon as Chelsea retook the lead, Benteke emerged - replacing Agbonlahor. He had been readying himself in any case but was unable to alter the course of the match. At the end Mourinho strode across the turf he had finally conquered and beckoned to his supporters to keep making noise. Much more of this and the title will be theirs.

"US President Barack Obama said the growing crisis in Iraq threatens America but rejects the idea of sending troops to fight militant organizations 'wherever they pop up'. Obama said his administration would not fall into the trap of 'whack-a-mole' foreign policy when a global, targeted response was needed to counter extremists. I think it's important for us to . recognize that ISIS is just one of a number of organizations that we . have to stay focused on,' Obama told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell. 'This . is going to be a global challenge and one that the United States is . going to have to address but we're not going to be able to address it . alone.' Scroll down for video . Concerned: US President Barack Obama told 'CBS This Morning' journalist Norah O'Donnell (right) that Sunni militants which have taken over parts of northern Iraq pose a 'medium- and long-term threat' to America because of their extreme ideology . He added: 'And as I said yesterday, what we can't do is think that we're . just going to play whack-a-mole and send US troops occupying various . countries wherever these organizations pop up. 'We're going to have to have a more focused, more targeted strategy and . we're going to have to partner and train local law enforcement and . military to do their jobs as well.' He said Sunni . militants that have seized Iraqi towns pose a 'medium- . and long-term threat' to the US because of their extreme ideology, but expects that the local populations would . reject ISIS because of their violence. Meanwhile U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is . discouraging Arab nations from sending financial support to even . moderate opposition Sunni groups in Syria, fearing the aid could be used to help the growing insurgency in Iraq. Kerry says he delivered that message to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi during their meeting Sunday in Cairo. He says he plans to make the same case to other leaders in Sunni-dominated Arab states over the next several days, as the region's security is facing a critical moment as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant gains ground in Iraq. The group has taken over parts of Syria in what is rapidly deteriorating into a cross-border war. He'll urge Arab states to work together to defeat the group. Diplomacy: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (left) met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Hassan Shoukry in Cairo, Egypt on June 22 . The news comes as rebel fighters from . Islamic militant group ISIS have captured four more towns in Iraq . including a crossing on the border with Syria. Qaim, . Rawah and Anah all fell to rebels fighters yesterday, while civilians . in the town of Rutba are negotiating a surrender after units stationed . on the outskirts threatened to start shelling. The . towns, the first to fall in the mainly Sunni province of Anbar, were . captured as Shiite volunteer soldiers marched through Baghdad as the . country heads towards sectarian war. The . capture of Rawah, situated on the Euphrates River, and the nearby . settlement of Anah, also raises the prospect that ISIS militants are . marching towards a dam at Haditha. Unrest: Mehdi Army fighters loyal to Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr joined in the marches which also took place in the southern cities of Basra and Amarah on June 21 . Defense: Kurdish Peshmerga troops secure an area in the town of Sulaiman Pek in Salahuddin province on June 21, as Sunni fighters seize a border post on the Iraq-Syria frontier . If the dam and adjoining power station were destroyed, it would cripple the country's power grid and cause widespread flooding. Iraqi military officials said more than 2,000 troops were quickly dispatched to the site of the dam to protect it against a possible attack by the Sunni militants. Rawah's mayor, Hussein Ali al-Aujail, . said the militants ransacked the town's government offices and forced . local army and police forces to pull out. Rawah and Anah had remained under government control since nearby Fallujah fell to the Sunni militants in January. The . capture of a border crossing at Qaim has allowed ISIS to move heavy . artillery and vehicles from Syria with ease for use on Iraqi . battlefields. Troops have long been able to cross unimpeded.

Patriotic: A group of farmers form a brigade to defend Iraq after top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani called for volunteers to fight against ISIS militants . Syrian rebels have already seized the facilities on the Syrian side of the border and several other posts in areas under their control. Police and the army said the Sunni insurgents seized Qaim and its crossing, about 200 miles west of Baghdad, after killing about 30 Iraqi troops in day-long clashes on Friday. The officials said people were now crossing back and forth freely. Chief military spokesman Lt Gen Qassim al-Moussawi acknowledged Qaim's fall, saying troops aided by local tribesmen sought to clear the city of 'terrorists'.","Barack Obama says extreme ideology of Sunni militants pose a 'medium- and long-term threat' to the US .

"Relief around the Etihad quickly gave way to realisation that Manchester City have fallen seven points behind Chelsea. The Premier League champions narrowly avoided a third straight home defeat, but this will go down as a serious stumble in the title race. Manuel Pelllegrini’s side have now failed to win in their last five games here, including those setbacks in the league and cup to Arsenal and Middlesbrough. It could have been worse had James Milner not curled a magnificent 25-yard freekick around Hull’s defensive wall deep into injury-time to deny the relegation strugglers their first away win over City in 85 years.

Even Milner couldn’t be fooled into thinking this was a good result, however. ‘Chelsea have a big lead now,’ he admitted. ‘It wasn’t good enough. We knew it would be tough against a spirited side but we’ve slipped up at home again. ‘Over 90 minutes we didn’t do what we should have done, and we need to re-group and come back again. ‘You look at our success in recent seasons and it was built on solid home form. It shows we now need to make up the ground away from home.’ Despite City’s wealth of options – their bench alone cost £130million compared to the £21.5m it took to build Hull’s entire starting line-up – they once again struggled to unlock a team who defended stubbornly. Pellegrini recalled Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko but to little effect. They clearly miss Yaya Toure whose absence at the Africa Cup of Nations has coincided with the recent slump.

City fans make a protest at the ground as they appeal for the introduction of safestanding to English football . It needed Milner, a 66th-minute replacement for Dzeko, to break Hull’s resistance after Tom Huddlestone had fouled Aguero. The England midfielder will be out of contract in the summer and there is no guarantee that he will sign a new one. On the evidence of his strike, City should step up their efforts as soon as possible. Pellegrini said: ‘In 24 games, James Milner has started 20 of them. I needed to make changes because in the last two games we didn’t score one goal here against Arsenal or Middlesbrough. ‘He scored a beautiful goal from a freekick. But it’s not about Milner or Yaya, we must be a creative team again. Once again we couldn’t create space against a team with 10 players behind the ball. ‘Before the game if you’d said we were going to draw against Hull I wouldn’t have liked it. But the way we did it was not so bad with a goal in the last minute.’ Hull had lost 10 of their last 14 league games but it was clear from the start that Steve Bruce’s side were not going to lie down, and they should have gone ahead in the 16th minute when Ahmed Elmohamady headed against the underside of the bar from Robbie Brady’s cross. Hull y midfielder David Meyler scored the opening goal of the game as they took an unlikely  1-0 lead at  City .

Hull's new £3million signing Dame N’Doye (left) came on as a second half substitute to make his debut for the club . Joe Hart and Martin Demichelis had already got themselves into a muddle, taking it in in turns to hack the ball to safety with very little success, when another breakdown in communication proved even more costly in the 35th minute. Hart was on his way out of goal when Demichelis stepped in and played a poor clearance straight to Jake Livemore. The Hull midfielder’s shot was saved by Hart and ran loose to Gaston Ramirez. Pablo Zabaleta put in a challenge on Ramirez but the ball ricocheted off the Hull player against the post, and rolled to David Meyler to tuck home. It was a dog’s dinner of a goal and one that summed up City’s lamentable performance in the first half. Amazingly, it was also the 10th time in 24 league games this season that they have gone behind. They stepped up a gear after half-time and Dzeko forced Allan McGregor into a rare save when he met Pablo Zabaleta’s cross with a first-time shot. City thought they should have had a penalty moments later, and with some justification when Alex Bruce barrelled into the back of David Silva, but referee Jon Moss waved away their appeals. Hull players look crestfallen at the full-time whistle after conceding a late goal against Manchester City . It looked as though even a point would be beyond them when Aguero controlled Nasri’s cross to the back post in the 90th minute and hammered a shot against the underside of the bar. Then up stepped Milner. Pellegrini knows he has work to do – and fast – to stop Chelsea disappearing into the distance. ‘You are not seeing a team with doubt,’ said the City boss. ‘The team is running, the team has spirit, the team has possession of the ball. We work and try. ‘I would be more angry or disappointed if we didn’t run or we seemed like a tired team or don’t have ideas. I don’t think it’s that. ‘It’s more important to work with them than be angry because creative players like Nasri, Silva, Aguero, Edin or Jovetic will return to their normal performance.'","David Meyler scored the opening goal of the game on 35 minutes with a left-footed strike for Hull .

"Harry Kane was on cloud nine after his double earned Tottenham a 2-1 north London derby win over Arsenal at White Hart Lane. The striker tapped home the equaliser before netting an 86th-minute winner with a superb header as Spurs fought back from conceding an early opener to Mesut Ozil. Kane, who has now scored 22 goals in all competitions this season, said on BT Sport 1: 'That feeling is one I definitely won't forget for the rest of my career.

'His quality and his potential is massive, he can improve more,' he said on BT Sport 1. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had no complaints over the result, but was unhappy with the performance of referee Martin Atkinson. He said: 'They created more chances and we cannot dispute too much that they win the game. The regret we have is that I believe we gave the goals away, the first and the second. But we didn't produce enough going forward.' The Frenchman added: 'I think we were not very good and the referee was at our level.'","Harry Kane struck twice in the second half to help his side claim win .

"January was a quiet month for Brendan Rodgers in terms of transfers but there was one move Liverpool’s manager knew he had to make. Having watched Jordon Ibe grow and develop in 24 demanding games on loan for Derby County, Rodgers felt compelled to bring him back to Merseyside and see if he could make a contribution in the frantic pursuit of a Champions League place. It might have seemed an unusual decision, to give a 19-year-old with such little top flight experience such a big responsibility, but Rodgers’ thinking was clear. While staying in the East Midlands would have aided his education, why should another manager benefit when he could aid Liverpool? Jordon Ibe rattles the post with a long-range effort during the Merseyside derby on Saturday . Ibe dribbles with the ball while being tracked by Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku . And do not doubt that Rodgers rates him. He has regularly spoken of him in glowing terms, saying that if you turned up at Melwood and were unaware of who was who in his squad, you would have Ibe down as Portuguese or Spanish given his technical ability and skill. ‘We brought him back because with system we play (3-4-3), he can play in four positions,’ Rodgers explained ahead of this trip to Goodison Park. ‘There is greater chance for him to play. I felt for six months, he needed to go out and play consistently. ‘He went with Steve MacLaren at Derby, who is a very good coach and plays really good football. This was the ideal time to bring him back and he has matured really well. It is unfortunate he is not able to play in cup games but he has got incredible talent. My job is to nurture that.’ So back came Ibe and, true to his word, Rodgers has given him minutes, first at Aston Villa then against West Ham before, most significantly, unleashing him from the start in the frenzy of a Merseyside derby. Everton's Bryan Oviedo puts in a tackle on Ibe during the first half at Goodison Park . The Liverpool youngster robs Steven Naismith of the ball during the Premier League clash . Rodgers isn’t afraid to make big calls nor does he ever consider age if he thinks a player is good enough, so with Lazar Markovic nursing a back problem, in came the England youth international, whose first Liverpool appearance in May 2013 came on the day Jamie Carragher retired. If the game was a disappointment, one of the most ordinary, tame and mundane 90 minutes this grand old fixture has ever witnessed, Ibe most certainly wasn’t and he was responsible for providing the genuine moments of entertainment. First there was electric charge down the right flank, then a chance arriving on to a Raheem Sterling cross before, most spectacularly of all, he cracked a drive against the side of a post from 25 yards after he had turned Bryan Oviedo one way then the other. While others wanted too many touches and were deliberate with their passes, Ibe was constantly looking for a way to stamp his name on the game right until the very end. Fearless and exciting, this will not be the last we see of him. His future is certainly bright. Ibe could be part of a very bright future for Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers .

"Harry Kane has to be in the England squad next month. He’s made the step at every level. England is the next natural stage of his development. To play in his first north London derby and score twice is extraordinary. When you’re looking at a youngster, you bring them into first-team training to see what they can do against your experienced players. And if he copes with that, you take the next step and put him on the pitch. Then you find out for real and the player finds out as well. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has shown he is capable of being in the spotlight by impressing against Arsenal . Tottenham academy graduate Kane roars in celebration after scoring his first derby goal . Kane races away to celebrate after he equalised in the second half at White Hart Lane . Kane has progressed bit by bit. He’s been able to reproduce in the first team everything he’s done in the youth team and Under 21s. Then the confidence comes and suddenly you have a player. I love the fact that for the first goal against Arsenal, the minute the ball came off the hand of David Ospina, he’s reacting. There was no tightness or freezing up. He knew exactly where he was going. He had scored in that split second. He was relaxed and put it away. He has a little bit of everything. He can play in the pocket and up top and his movement is very cute. For the second goal, if he hadn’t moved to the side of Laurent Koscielny, he wouldn’t get the chance to score that great header. The 21-year-old has previously impressed for England's Under 21 side . Christian Eriksen (left) and Mousa Dembele (right) have also been in impressive form  in recent weeks . It was a fantastic performance all round from Tottenham. Their intensity and tempo was superb throughout the 90 minutes. There are three players who have elevated them this season: one is Kane, another is Christian Eriksen but the third is Mousa Dembele. He’s one of the best in the country at going past a player. But if he does it in a deep position, he’s not the same threat as when he plays behind the striker. I feel he’s more suited to that position than Eriksen, because the formation they have at the moment allows Eriksen to drift in from wide positions. They’ve found a balance in those front players. I’d play Andros Townsend ahead of Erik Lamela, but the formula is working well at the moment. And the full backs, Kyle Walker and Danny Rose, are absolutely key. They have the energy to provide width and they release Eriksen and Lamela to come inside, which is crucial to the balance of the team. If they can keep those two fit and fresh, then Tottenham may be able to negotiate upcoming Europa League games and keep on track for the top four.","Harry Kane struck twice in his first north London derby appearance .

"It was as all going so swimmingly in defence for Arsenal. Laurent Koscielny was fit after Achilles tendinitis, Per Mertesacker’s recent displays were markedly better, Nacho Monreal was looking like a player who could displace Kieran Gibbs at left back and Hector Bellerin was finding his feet since graduating from the club academy. For 56 minutes it looked like Arsenal would earn a fourth consecutive Premier League clean sheet. Then they allowed Harry Kane too much space to drill home the equaliser, before Koscielny lost the striker in the lead up to the late winner. Back to square one, it seems, in the space of 30 minutes.

"Click here to read Sportsmail's interview with Blackpool president Valeri Belokon . Blackpool have sacked manager Jose Riga. Riga held talks with chairman Karl Oyston this morning where it was agreed it was time to end the manager’s four-and-a-half month spell in charge at Bloomfield Road. The Belgian’s time at the club has been blighted by constant rows with his chairman and their relationship reached a point of no return over the weekend. Blackpool are expected to part company with beleaguered manager Jose Riga this week . Ex-Birmingham City manager Lee Clark is being sounded out as Riga's replacement at Bloomfield Road . Riga lost eleven of his 16 games in charge after starting the season with just 13 players on the opening day. A statement on the club's website read: 'Blackpool Football Club can confirm that Head Coach Jose Riga has had his contract terminated with immediate effect.' Former Birmingham manager Lee Clark  has emerged as the early candidate. Sportsmail understands Clark - sacked by Birmingham City just last week -  could be appointed as soon as Wednesday. Clark is used to working under a strict budget given the financial constraints put on him at St Andrew's and remains highly thought of within the game despite a turbulent time in the Midlands.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers praised the composure of his young players in the heat of a Merseyside derby which never really fully ignited at Goodison Park. The visitors hit the post through 19-year-old Jordon Ibe, on only his second Barclays Premier League start, but that was the closest either side came. Everton did not register a shot on target until the 86th minute when Seamus Coleman forced Simon Mignolet to save. Jordon Ibe dribbles with the ball while being tracked by Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku . Everton's Bryan Oviedo puts in a tackle on Ibe during the first half at Goodison Park . Ibe could be part of a very bright future for Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers . Ibe was named man of the match, which justified Rodgers' decision to last month bring him back from a loan spell at Derby. 'I have been just waiting to put him in. I called him back because I thought now he can really contribute,' he said. 'He had a great spell on loan, which is what you want from your young players, and he had a good time at a good club but it was time for him to come back and feature. 'I had no qualms about putting him in. It was a brilliant performance by him, he was unfortunate not to have scored with his run and strike. 'He has wonderful temperament and technique and is tactically very good for a kid coming into that system. I am very pleased for him. 'What was decent was in such an intense atmosphere the composure of the young players. 'Emre Can, he was like a Rolls Royce at the back at 21 and he defended fantastically. 'Jordon Ibe and the rest showed great composure. They connected the game really well and we now have got a real solid structure defensively and 86 minutes was (Everton's) first shot on target.' Emre Can, pictured with three Everton players, looked assured during his first Merseyside derby . The downside was the early loss of midfielder Lucas Leiva to a thigh problem, which is likely to keep the Brazilian out for a while. Everton had their own injury issues to deal with prior to kick-off with left back Leighton Baines failing a fitness test on a knee injury and winger Aiden McGeady likely to be out for longer after sustaining bruising on a bone in his knee. 'It was a bit of a disappointment. He (Leighton) didn't want to miss the game for any money in the world but the knee wouldn't settle,' said Toffees boss Roberto Martinez. 'He wasn't 100 per cent to play. I don't know about Wednesday (against Chelsea). He could be available. I don't think it is a long-term problem. 'Aiden McGeady got a knock in training and has a bruised bone in his knee and he will be longer.' Everton left back Leighton Baines missed the Merseyside derby due to a knee injury . Martinez felt his side handled a technical game well. 'It became a fascinating game, tactically, two asymmetric shapes that would allow some space,' he added. 'There weren't many open chances; Liverpool hit the post in the first half from long range and Steven Gerrard's overhead kick, that was all. 'We were in good positions in the first half but couldn't find the composure or final pass but when Seamus Coleman got into the penalty late in the second half you thought that was the moment. 'I thought the tempo and intensity of the sides was typical of a Merseyside derby. Ross Barkley puts his jacket back on after Roberto Martinez changed his mind regarding a substitution . 'We got a very important clean sheet and another strong performance that will allow us to become more confident on the ball and get that arrogance with our play.' The Spaniard defended his handling of Ross Barkley, who was set to come on five minutes before half-time but did not get on until five minutes from the end. 'Steven Naismith had a really nasty fall, his neck got twisted and the doctor was concerned but we felt he could carry on until half-time,' he said. 'He didn't want to come off, Mo Besic was carrying a bit of a niggle, James McCarthy was coming back (from injury), Gareth Barry was on nine bookings so I had to make sure I didn't use a substitution cheaply. 'Ross was desperate to come on but Naisy was desperate not to come off and it was the right call medically.'","Brendan Rodgers reserved special praise for the Liverpool starlets .

"It is almost seven months since Louis van Gaal took over at Manchester United and you would have to say that they are still not where they would have hoped to be in terms of team development. They may be satisfied with their position in the table — they can return to third place if they beat West Ham — and it’s difficult to argue with a run that has produced one defeat in 16 games. But there is still something that doesn’t quite gel about this Manchester United team. Wayne Rooney has been asked to play in midfield in order to accommodate the likes of Angel di Maria . Di Maria has been playing at the tip of the diamond in recent weeks with Rooney playing in a deeper role . Radamel Falcao has been given the chance to prove his worth by partnering Robin van Persie in attack . Rooney's Opta heat map against Cambridge showed he barely featured in attack, with much more time spent either out wide right or in his own half . The back-three line-up looks as though it will be dispensed with for now. Although there have been injuries which have hampered Van Gaal’s ability to play that system, there simply are not enough players who have adapted to it. They really look more comfortable in a back four at this point. Earlier in the season it was the defence which had proved the big problem, but in that 16-game unbeaten run they have conceded just seven goals. It is not an assured back line just yet but it is a long way from the chaos of the 5-3 defeat by Leicester in September. In attack, though, I only see glimpses of a team who are really clicking and usually that is only at Old Trafford. Van Gaal has now had long enough with them that offensively they should look comfortable, especially with the array of talent he has at his disposal. The individuals themselves can look impressive at times — Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria or Wayne Rooney — but, especially away from home, it still looks as though they are sorting out how to play. And it’s a long way into the season to be still sorting this out. At the heart of that is the problem of where to play Rooney. Van Gaal wants to play two up top and the versatility of Rooney means that he is the one to drop in to midfield, with Van Persie and Radamel Falcao as the strikers. I don’t have a problem with Rooney in midfield. In fact, I think it can suit him and become his best position in the later stages of his career. But which part of the midfield do you play him? Former Real Madrid star Di Maria has been given a free licence to roam around behind the main strikers . Louis van Gaal is struggling to find a way of getting the best out of his attacking players . Falcao and Rooney, pictured travelling to London, are expected to be involved against West Ham . If he is one of the attacking players in a 4-3-3 formation, with at least one midfielder holding a defensive role, then I think he can thrive in that position. He has the licence to break into the box from the deeper positions and face the play, rather than have his back to goal. I think that could work to his advantage. He also has the vision to play great passes and pick out his team-mates from midfield, so I understand why Van Gaal wants him there. I can even see him at the tip of a diamond in midfield, but that seems to be the role for Di Maria. What does not work is when he is playing in a diamond as one of the central midfielders behind Di Maria. That is not his role. There’s too much tracking back to be done in that position and he will end up in very deep positions. You want Rooney to be the hub of the team, breaking into the box. Also, in that position, you have to pull wide at times to give the team tactical stability. That again takes him away from the action. Rooney played on the right of a midfield diamond against Cambridge United on Tuesday . The United captain, pictured scoring against West Ham in March 2014, has not scored since Boxing Day . I can see that the diamond formation might seem the most natural way for Van Gaal to go at the moment but it won’t get the best out of Rooney — and if you don’t get the best out of Rooney then it’s difficult to see that it will be best for Manchester United. It is important they do work out a style which does flow in these final months of the season. If they qualify for the Champions League then I’m sure most people at the club would say that was a job well done for this campaign. Next season, of course, the expectation will be much higher. But they do need that top-four spot to ensure they can keep recruiting the best players next season. And that is not at all certain. Tottenham are coming on a good run; Arsenal have Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck coming back; Liverpool already have Daniel Sturridge back, which should make an enormous difference. Plus, my old club Southampton are so well set up that they will cause all those teams more worries before the season is over. I said at the start of the campaign that United would not finish in the top four unless they got their defenders back. It’s still looking like it will be a close-run contest and, with a couple of their rivals in the ascendancy, United cannot afford to look like a team in transition. The Red Devils will be hoping to secure a spot in next season's Champions League during the next few months . It was sad to leave Queens Park Rangers this week but once Harry Redknapp had decided that he couldn’t go on, it felt like the right thing to leave at the same time. Harry brought me in there to do a specific job and, once he had gone, there seemed no point in staying. It was a surprise how quickly it all turned out. Harry has been in pain for some time with his knees and the news that he needed an operation was a real blow to him. Last time that happened he was on crutches for 12 weeks. That said, we were in and out of the relegation zone and I reckon if Harry had been able to stay, we would have climbed out of the bottom three once again. Glenn Hoddle decided to leave QPR following Harry Redknapp's resignation from the west London outfit . Everyone on the coaching staff was aware that we needed better results. But equally it looked as though fortunes were going to ebb and flow throughout the season among the teams towards the bottom. Each week another team or manager seems to be under pressure. We were confident we could make sure it wasn’t us by the end of the season. I’ve heard all the theories as to why he left but I don’t believe it was related to the January transfer window. The club tried to bring in the right players but, as deadline day approached, it simply became harder and harder. Hoddle enjoyed his time at QPR but it was only right to leave the club following Redknapp's departure . I have enjoyed the past six months, however. I’ve never been in a pure coaching role before and, though I was apprehensive when I went into it, I discovered that I really enjoyed it. Clearly as manager there has to be a degree of distance between you and the team. You’re always the man who has dropped half of the squad, so it’s impossible to be too close. But that wasn’t the case as a coach and I found I liked being that much closer to the players. I also enjoyed coaching the Under 21s at times. There are a good crop of players coming through at QPR from there. My hope for the club is that they do now stay up under a new manager. There were some good people at the club and I enjoyed my time there. As for the future, I have some business interests and I enjoy writing this column and of course I have my punditry with Sky Sports and ITV.

"Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon scored for Napoli as they beat fellow title hopefuls Roma 2-0 amid high tension at the Stadio San Paolo on Saturday. Higuain, who previously hadn't scored in his first seven Serie A games this season, netted his fifth this week after three minutes as Napoli got off to a blistering start.

Roma, meanwhile, fall three points behind leaders Juventus, who beat Empoli on Saturday, while Napoli moved into third. This was the first time the two sides had met since the clashes that led to a fan's death from a shooting before the Italian Cup final in May. Roma fans were barred from traveling to Naples for the game but there were still concerns of reprisal attacks and there were tight security measures put in place. Roma came into the match on a high after moving level with Juventus at the top of the table, while Napoli coach Rafa Benitez was still under pressure after mixed results.

Higuain acrobatically volleyed home with a scissor kick following Lorenzo Insigine deflected effort, then Insigne and Callejon both went desperately close soon after.

And he celebrated with fellow goalscorer Higuain as they both played an influential part in the result .

However, it was again Napoli which had the best opportunity shortly after the hour mark when Kalidou Koulibaly led a rapid counter attack and set up Callejon, who dinked the ball over De Sanctis only for Radja Nainggolan to sprint back and clear off the line. But they did finally managed to kill the game off with six minutes to spare, as a delightful diagonal pass from Higuain allowed Callejon to slot home.","Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon score as Napoli defeat Roma .

"Female genital mutilation will be featured on BBC One's Casualty this weekend - the first time a mainstream broadcaster has tackled the subject in a drama series. The programme to be aired on Saturday night is the second part of a storyline that follows a young girl called Tamasha who injures herself deliberately to avoid being sent abroad for the procedure. Not only is the practice of female genital mutilation illegal in the UK, but it is also illegal to assist in the procedure being done overseas. According to Government statistics . there are more than 20,000 girls at risk under the age of 15 and another . 66,000 women in the UK are living with the consequences. Scroll down for video . A character called Tamasha (pictured left) is the victim of female genital mutilation in an episode of Casualty . One . of the main reasons behind female genital mutilation is the belief that . it is beneficial for the girl or woman and it is most prevalent in 28 . African countries and parts of the Middle East and Asia. In teenager Tamasha's case, as with many other girls that undergo the procedure, she is due to be sent abroad. Aware . of what is about to happen to her, she tries to injure herself then . confides in a nurse who suggests she fakes having a severe headache in . order to miss the flight. At the end of the last episode of Casualty viewers learned that Tamasha went missing from hospital. In . the next part of the storyline she tries to stop an unqualified doctor . from operating on her sister and three other young girls. She . helps drive his car off the road, leaving him facing impotence, but . what happens to the girls is even worse. They are operated on by family . members and one is left on the verge of death. The programme did cause some concern, with a commenter on Mumsnet posting: 'Would you explain this to a 10 year old? 'We . were watching the episode and she asked ""what just happened"" but I . didn't want to explain at that moment just before going to bed. Not sure . whether to tell her tomorrow or let it lie until she asks again when . she's older.' Tamasha hurt herself to go to hospital in order to miss a flight for a 'holiday' in which she would have undergone the procedure . But another added: 'There are ways of talking to a young child about FGM without going into graphic detail and questions like that should be answered as otherwise the child is going to think that it can't be talked about - which is far from the truth. 'And the sad truth is that the reason FGM's still practiced in Britain and that British girls are still being taken abroad to be cut (both illegal under British law) is that not enough people know about the practice, and quite often those who do and are in a position to prevent it happening or intervene in some way are too worried about accusations of racism or cultural insensitivity - or just too embarrassed to talk about a girl's genitals.' Lisa Zimmermann, project manager of Integrate Bristol said: 'We are delighted with the finished work, it is handled sensitively without avoiding any of the issues or demonising a particular community group. 'We are hugely grateful to ""Casualty"" for having the courage to take on this issue which many people don't want to talk about for fear of offending relatives and communities.' A BBC spokesman said: 'Casualty has a . long history of tackling issues, which reflect modern day life and with . the growing awareness of FGM this is an issue that has very much been . brought to the forefront. 'We consulted a number of . organisations when developing the storyline and characters, and have . taken advice from the BBC’s editorial policy advisers to ensure the . material is appropriate for the time slot.'

"Jairo Ben, who had moved to the Phillippines only two months ago, was discovered near a mass grave after the typhoon . The body of a six-year-old British boy was among around 1,000 corpses at a mass grave in the typhoon-ravaged Philippines. His mother, Mary Joy Escalante Ducusin, who also lost her husband in the disaster, sobbed bitterly as she discovered the bag bearing his tiny corpse waiting to be put into the pit in a cemetery above the badly hit city of Tacloban. 'For several days I kept on searching for him but now I have found him,' she cried. 'No words could really explain how painful it is.' Ducusin and her husband, Jeff, 45, both Philippines nationals, moved to Britain several years ago to work as nurses in Harlow, near London. Their only child, Jairo Ben, was born there six years ago. He was a British passport holder and grew up speaking English. Two months ago the family moved back to the Philippines to start a new life. But weeks later the monster typhoon smashed into Tacloban, bringing a destructive storm surge that swamped entire neighbourhoods. 'It was so quick,' she recalled. 'All I remember was the water rising to the top of my house.' Mary Joy Ducusin weeps after finding her son Jairo Ben among the bodies brought to one of three mass burial sites . Beyond grief: Mrs Ducusin says 'I don't want to think about tomorrow. I just want to live life day by day, I don't know where to start, I don't know where to pick up the pieces' Family support: Mrs Ducusin is accompanied by her father to the mass grave site in Tacloban. Lines of bodes stretch into the background as officialls say around 4,000 people have died . Jairo Ben, Ducusin, her husband and his mother climbed onto the roof, but were blown off by the 200mph winds of Super Typhoon Haiyan that smashed through the central Philippines on November 8. The 37-year-old Ducusin was the family's sole survivor of the typhoon. 'We were carried to the second floor of a house nearby. But I didn't see my mother-in-law or my six-year-old boy again.' She scoured the debris left by the monster flood for days in the desperate hope of finding him. 'One of my neighbours sent me a text message saying that they had found a boy, like six years old with the green shirt and the stuffed toy,' she said. Typhoon Haiyan ripped through Tacloban in the Philippines, and has been described as one of the most powerful typhoons ever to hit land . Authorities estimate more than 3,900 people were killed when Typhoon Haiyan, one of the largest ever recorded, made landfall in the central Philippines and the sea surged ashore . 'My baby loves the stuffed toy so much because when he was born, even in the hospital, he got that stuffed toy. He called it Cocoa.' The unidentified bodies are among the around 4,000 people known to have died in one of the most powerful storms ever recorded. The bodies are bagged and taken away by firemen on trucks that patrol Tacloban. They are then transported to a cemetery above the city for rudimentary identification by a forensic pathologist, who records the height and gender of each corpse, along with any distinguishing marks, and ascribes a number to each body. Filipino villagers carry goods taken from a washed up container in the super typhoon devastated city of Tacloban . A Philippines Air Force crew member looks out from his helicopter at Tacloba, during a flight to deliver relief goods in the Leyte province . Then they are put into the communal grave. On Tuesday more than 700 putrefying bodies lay piled on top of each other in the grave. Around 250 more were waiting to be processed. Among them was that of Jairo Ben. 'I don't want to think about tomorrow,' said his heartbroken mother. 'I just want to live life day by day, I don't know where to start, I don't know where to pick up the pieces.'","Jairo Ben's body was found in a bag waiting to be put into a mass grave in destroyed city Tacloban .

"Manal Mahmoud has agreed to leave the £1.25m property in affluent Fulham for a new home outside the area . A mother whose refugee family trashed a £1.25million rented house paid for by the taxpayer was told today she will be given a new taxpayer-funded property - but faces jail if her wayward children do not behave. After pressure from Hammersmith and Fulham Council, Manal Mahmoud has agreed to leave the borough and signed a court order promising her seven children would clean up their act. The agreement means the clan, branded the ‘family from hell’ by neighbours, will be given a new taxpayer-funded property after Hammersmith and Fulham Council acknowledged it had a ‘legal obligation’ to find them a new home. By signing the undertaking, Ms Mahmoud could be jailed if she ‘or anyone living’ at her new property causes a nuisance. But a hearing at West London County Court was told today the family could be moved out of the borough meaning the west London council would not be responsible for enforcing it. The Palestinian family moved into the Victorian end-of-terrace home after it was given a £76,000 facelift and received thousands of pounds in housing benefit. But they were branded the ‘family from hell’ by neighbours following months of antisocial behaviour at the property, where the driveway has been smashed up, doors are hanging off and rubbish and furniture have been dumped in the garden. Taxpayers partially footed the bill for a . new kitchen and roof along with decoration costs before the family . moved in three years ago. One of Ms Mahmoud’s sons, Ossama, 19, is in prison for drug-dealing and another, Ziad, was today forced to sign an anti- social behaviour agreement after terrorising neighbours by driving a motorbike up and down the street and doing wheelies. Wrecked: Manal Mahmoud and her family trashed this property in Fulham, but will be given another taxpayer-funded property to live in . Ms Mahmoud left West London County Court and has been told she could face jail if she or her family cause a nuisance in their new neighbourhood . District Judge Nicholson told Ms Mahmoud she faced prison if she could not control her family. He told her: 'You are being asked to give an undertaking to the court. It is a promise to the court. 'If you break that undertaking, the . London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham may apply to the court for your . committal to prison. 'It . is a promise not to cause a nuisance yourself or any annoyance or . disturbance to your neighbours. You have to ensure that anyone visiting . or living with you is not likewise going to cause a nuisance. 'Ziad your son has signed an anti-social behaviour agreement.' The family’s barrister, who refused to give his name, said Ms Mahmoud understood the serious nature of the order. He . said: 'My client is offering an undertaking to the court and it is on . the basis that she’s promising to comply with the terms of her tenancy. Angered: This young man, presumed to be one of Ms Mahmoud's sons, swore at photographers outside the property . 'Legal obligation': Hammersmith and Fulham council will find the family a new property as they agreed to leave the area . 'The significant paragraph is allowing visitors or those living with her to cause a nuisance. 'I’ve explained the significance of that and the potential, if there is a breach, of imprisonment.' But he said if the family were moved . away from the borough that would be the 'end of the matter' as a . cash-strapped council would not waste resources monitoring a family in . another locality. Hammersmith and Fulham have now agreed to find them a new home elsewhere. 'They . [Hammersmith and Fulham] have accepted that they need to do that and . that is within the duties under the Housing Act 1966,' the barrister . said. Councillor Greg . Smith, deputy leader of Hammersmith and Fulham, said he was 'committed' to ensuring the family were moved outside of the borough. He . said: 'This council takes a zero tolerance approach to antisocial . behaviour and our residents can now bid these neighbours from hell . farewell. Visitors: Police called on Ms Mahmoud's property on Tuesday, but it is not clear why . Not bad: The quiet and leafy road where Ms Mahmoud and her family live . 'It is appalling that families like this repay the British taxpayer by wreaking havoc and showing a complete lack of respect to their law-abiding and hard-working neighbours. 'We fully support the introduction of more sensible and lower housing benefit caps that can end this country’s damaging benefit’s culture that fails to incentivise hard work and instead support people who abide by the rules of a decent and civilised society.' Ms Mahmoud, who came to Britain in 2000 with her husband before they split up, told reporters on Tuesday that she deserved to live in the property. She said: ‘I am entitled to live in a house like this, even if I don’t pay for it and get benefits. A young man swears at photographers outside the £1.25m house on Tuesday, left, and Manal Mahmoud leaving West London County Court today after a hearing, right . ‘It is fair that the Government houses us. ‘I know I have a son who makes trouble but that doesn’t mean all my children are the same. ‘Neighbours are complaining because the landlord rented the house to council tenants – they don’t want a foreigner to live in  this street. ‘I know the house doesn’t look its best. ‘I don’t try to maintain and repair the house, I don’t fix the tiles or paint the walls. ‘I haven’t got enough money – I  only have my benefits.

"Bad boy golfer Dustin Johnson has been suspended for six months from the PGA Tour for testing positive for cocaine, according to a new report. Johnson has failed two other drug tests before, including one for marijuana in 2009 and another one for cocaine in 2012. according to Golf.com. The 2012 test also earned him a suspension, but it was never made public, the website reported. Scroll down for video . Hiatus: Dustin Johnson is to take an immediate break from golf . Johnson . says he quit the game to seek 'professional help' following a chequered . personal history which includes a DUI arrest, drug rumours and links to a . gangland murder. The . world number 16, who earlier this year announced his engagement to . model girlfriend Paulina Gretzky, said he needed the time to focus on . his mental health, physical well-being and emotional foundation. Johnson, . 30, who finished 12th in The Open two weeks ago and was fourth in the . US Ryder Cup standings, is well known for leading a party lifestyle that . led to him being labelled an unfulfilled talent. The PGA of America confirmed he won’t be part of the United States team at Gleneagles. European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley seemed to suggest Johnson should have been clearer about his reasons for stepping down.

"The wife of hate preacher Abu Hamza should be evicted from her taxpayer-funded £1million council house, her local MP said last night. Hamza's second wife Moroccan-born Najat Mostafa, 53, has lived in the five-bedroom property for more than 15 years, bringing up the couple's eight children. But most of them have now moved out, with just two living there according to neighbours in west London. Scroll down for video . Conservative MP for Fulham and Chelsea Greg Hands (right), whose constituency includes Shepherd's Bush where the wife of hate preacher Abu Hamza (left), Najat Mostafa, lives . The former imam at the Finsbury Park mosque, who has been in custody since 2004, was extradited to America for trial last Friday. Attack: Nagat Hamza, Abu Hamza's wife, pictured, should leave her taxpayer-funded council house, an MP has said . Tomorrow he faces a hearing in New York to answer charges of terrorist activities in the U.S. and Yemen. Greg Hands, the Conservative MP for Fulham and Chelsea, told The Daily Telegraph: 'I would strongly welcome any move by the council to take a look at Hamza's wife's status and the large council house in one of London's wealthiest neighbourhoods to see whether something might be done to move Hamza's family on.' One of the family's neighbours is former Labour cabinet minister John Hutton while others include bankers and television producers. Hamza, who is missing boths . hands and an eye, never officially lived in the Shepherd's Bush house but was often seen there by neighbours before his arrest in August 2004 for incitement to murder and racial hatred. In 2006 he was jailed for seven years. His wife moved into it in 1995 after claiming they had separated. Police raided his council-owned house in 2004 and found thousands of extremist video and audio tapes ready for distribution. In 2006 it emerged he had bought a four-bedroom semi in Greenford for £220,000 cash while in prison. At the same time the Islamist extremist was running up a legal aid bill which had then cost the taxpayer £250,000, and the property was later seized to  claw back some of the cash.

"Ed Miliband was last night accused of risking a second invasion of the Falklands by vetoing plans for military strikes on Syria. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the Labour leader had ‘better make clear’ to the Argentinian regime that the islands would be defended if they mounted a new invasion. Sir Malcolm, who made an impassioned speech backing the Prime Minister’s hawkish stance on Syria in Thursday’s debate, warned that Mr Cameron’s defeat could send a message of weakness to foreign powers. Message of weakness: Former Foreign Secretary . Sir Malcolm Rifkind, left, said Labour leader Ed Miliband, right, must make clear to the Argentinian government that he . would defend the Falklands from any aggression . ‘This will not affect our determination to defend the Falklands,’ Sir Malcolm told The Mail on Sunday. ‘But that had better be made clear to the Argentinian government – especially by Mr Miliband’. In today’s Survation poll, just over half of voters would support a British military response in the event of a second Argentinian invasion of the islands. The Conservative statesman’s intervention comes amid increasing tension between Britain and Argentina, more than three decades after the Task Force was sent to the South Atlantic. Last month, President Cristina Kirchner launched a new attack on British companies drilling for oil off the Falkland Islands by banning them from operating in its territory for 20 years. Buenos Aires said four companies had been conducting ‘illegal and clandestine’ activities off the South Atlantic archipelago. 'Intimidation': Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner launched a new attack on British companies drilling for oil off the Falkland Islands by banning them from operating in her country's territory for 20 years . The Foreign Office criticised the move as illegal and irresponsible and described it as an attempt to intimidate legitimate commercial ventures. The islands have been controlled by Britain since the 1830s but are claimed by Argentina as Las Malvinas. Last night, Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, secretary of the all-party parliamentary  group on the Falklands, said the future security of the islands could have been jeopardised by Mr Cameron’s Commons defeat. ‘It is clear that Labour played politics with Syria, using it as a tool  to wound Cameron,’ he said. ‘But if it has undermined the executive’s right to take military action in the national interest without the need to consult Parliament, it could have a serious impact on  the Falklands.’",Sir Malcolm Rifkind says Labour leader had 'better make clear' that the islands would be defended from any new invasion .
"Under threat: A man from Kiribati in the Pacific is trying to claim asylum in New Zealand on the grounds that he is fleeing the effects of climate change . A man from one of the Earth's lowest-lying nations is trying to convince judges he and his family are refugees. But he admits they are not fleeing persecution; instead, he says, they are trying to escape the disastrous effects of climate change. The 37-year-old and his wife left his remote atoll in the Pacific nation of Kiribati six years ago for drier land in New Zealand, where their three children were born. But immigration authorities have twice rejected his argument that rising sea levels make too dangerous for him and his family to return to his homeland. On October 16, the man's lawyer, Michael Kidd, plans to argue the case before New Zealand's High Court. Mr Kidd, who specialises in human rights cases, told The Associated Press he will appeal the case all the way to the country's Supreme Court if necessary. Legal experts consider the man's case a long shot, but it will nevertheless be closely watched, and might have implications for tens of millions of residents in low-lying territories around the world. Kiribati, an impoverished string of 33 coral atolls about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, is home to about 103,000 people and has been identified by scientists as among the nations most vulnerable to climate change. In a transcript of the immigration case obtained by the AP, the I-Kiribati man describes extreme high tides known as king tides that he says have started to regularly breach Kiribati's coastal defences. These inundations of saltwater, he says, kill crops, flood homes and sicken the country's people. New Zealand's immigration laws prevent the AP from naming the asylum seeker. He said that starting around 1998, king tides began regularly breaching the sea walls around his village, which was overcrowded and had no sewerage system. The fouled drinking water would make people vomit, he said, and there was no higher ground that would allow villagers to escape the knee-deep water. He claimed that returning to the island would endanger the lives of his two youngest children. 'There's no future for us when we go back to Kiribati,' he told the tribunal, according to the transcript. 'Especially for my children. There's nothing for us there.' The man's lawyer said the family is currently living and working on a New Zealand farm. 'Save us': I-Kiribati stand outside their . country's parliament with signs calling for immediate action on climate . change, which is believed to be the cause of rising sea levels that are . gradually drowning the Pacific nation . An international panel of climate . scientists last week issued a report saying that it was 'extremely . likely' that human activity was causing global warming, and predicted . that oceans could rise by as much as a metre (3ft 3⅜in) by the end of . the century. If that were to happen, much of Kiribati would simply disappear. Though . that is a dire prospect, New Zealand's Immigration and Protection . Tribunal has said it is not one that is addressed by laws dealing with . refugees. In a decision recently made public, . tribunal member Bruce Burson said the legal concept of a refugee is . someone who is being persecuted, which requires human interaction. He said the tribunal rejected the man's claim because nobody is persecuting him. The . tribunal found there was no evidence that the environmental conditions . on Kiribati were so bad that the man and his family would face imminent . danger should they return. Mr . Burson said the man's claim was also rejected because the family's . predicament was no different than that faced by the wider population of . Kiribati. In his court appeal, Mr Kidd, the . man's lawyer, said the fact that many people face the same threat is no . grounds to dismiss a claim. He . also argued that his client did suffer an indirect form of human . persecution because climate change is believed to be caused by the . pollution humans generate. He said his client also would face the threat of a climate-induced breakdown in law and order should he return. A man cleans his bike next to simple huts like . the ones most I-Kiribati live in: The asylum seeker described extreme . high tides known as king tides that have started to regularly breach . Kiribati's coastal defences . A typical house in Kiribati: He said that . starting around 1998, king tides began regularly breaching the sea walls . around his village, which was overcrowded and had no sewerage system, . leaving residents sickened . Bill Hodge, a constitutional law expert and associate professor at the University of Auckland, said he applauded Mr Kidd's 'ingenious arguments'. But he didn't think they would succeed because his client hasn't been singled out and victimised due to something like his gender, race or political persuasion. Nevertheless, Hodge added that even if the Kiribati man loses, his case might make a good argument for expanding the definition of what constitutes a refugee. He said he expected there would be increasing pressure on nations like New Zealand and Australia to help provide new homes for Pacific Islanders threatened by rising seas. Tidal gauges indicate the world's oceans have been rising at an annual rate of 3.2mm (0.1in) since 1970. Many scientists expect that rate to accelerate and for climate change to trigger more intense storms, which may pose an even more pressing threat to many of the world's low-lying islands. Must have a good reason to want to leave... Legal experts consider the man's case a long shot, but it will be . closely watched, and might have implications for tens of millions who . live in low-lying places around the world . Kiribati's government is pursuing its own strategies. It has paid a deposit for 6,000 acres in nearby Fiji, which Kiribati President Anote Tong has said will provide food security and a possible refuge for future generations. The nation has also been talking with a Japanese firm about the possibility of constructing a floating island, which would cost billions of dollars. Rimon Rimon, a Kiribati government spokesman who said his opinions on the matter were his own, said he thought the man in New Zealand was taking the wrong approach. He said the government is working hard to train people in skills like nursing, carpentry and automotive repairs so that if they do leave Kiribati, they can be productive in their adoptive countries. 'Kiribati may be doomed by climate change in the near future,' he said. 'But just claiming refugee status due to climate change is the easy way out.'","The 37-year-old left his atoll six years ago for drier land in New Zealand .

"A long-forgotten radio interview has been uncovered where David Bowie tells how his first American tour bombed after he got the wrong visa - and immigration officials banned him from performing. The landmark visit to the States was planned to be a coast-to-coast publicity drive to promote Bowie's third album, The Man Who Sold the World. But, despite organising a variety of gigs at colleges and universities following the album's U.S. release in 1970, he was left high and dry when border officials refused him permission to work. Scroll down for video . Mistake: David Bowie was prevented from performing in America in 1970 to plug his album because he did not have the right visa, it has been revealed . 'The Man Who Sold The World' (left) is seen by many as the genesis of glam rock. Right, Bowie poses for a portrait dressed as 'Ziggy Stardust' in a hotel room in 1973 in New York . It was later revealed the singer had failed to apply for an H1 employment visa, making it legal for him to perform. The oversight meant Bowie was forced to plug the album - hailed as the birth of glam rock - through secret gigs for 'whoever we could get in'. He was also restricted to simply talking about the album on U.S. radio shows, instead of performing any of its songs to live audiences. Bowie described the tour as 'awful', adding: 'I was sent [to America] to plug the LP, but I couldn't get an HI. Bowie with Guitarist Mick Ronson in 1972. He described the botched U.S. tour of two years earlier as 'awful' 'So I landed there and I found out all I could do was radio shows and talking about the album.' He met students 'and people who'd heard my material', and performed at 'the odd private house where I would play for whoever we could get in. We did it that way.' The 'lost' recording came to light for the first time in more than 40 years after Strawbs frontman Dave Cousins discovered the radio interview he did with Bowie in the back of a drawer. Discovery: Dave Cousins, of The Strawbs, found the long-forgotten interview on tape in his attic . Cousins interviewed the young Bowie in March 1971 during a five-year spell as a producer for the Danish broadcaster, Danmarks Radio. But the recording, which has never been played to a British audience, lay forgotten in his attic for more than four decades until he stumbled across it. Cousins claims the historical importance of Bowie's disclosure was 'completely overlooked' by the music media at the time. Cousins, whose band is best known for 1973 hits 'Part of the Union' and 'Lay Down', said: 'David Bowie rarely gives interviews, so it was a major coup for me and Danmarks Radio at the time. 'But David was not a megastar like he is today, which meant that this throwaway comment about his American tour fell on deaf ears. The Man Who Stole the World reached number 26 in the UK album charts following its release in 1970. In January and February of the following year, Mercury Records financed a publicity drive in order to promote it heavily in America. But upon arrival at an American airport, Bowie was told that the necessary working Visa had not been obtained in advance. He told the Danish station: 'Next time I hope I'll be able to work over there. So I really can't give you an honest opinion what I thought of American audiences because I didn't see any.' Cousins then asks: 'But in general, where the stuff's been played on the air, what sort of reaction has it had? 'Are people over there more interested in music than perhaps people over here, or is it the other way round?' 'When [Americans] really believe in something, they really go to town on it,' Bowie answers. 'And they believe in lifestyles. So everyone's got to have a lifestyle out there, and records are very much a part of younger people's lifestyle.' Exorcising Ghosts, the autobiography of Dave Cousins, is available through Omnibus Press from today priced £19.95.","The pioneering musician went to U.S. to plug The Man Who Sold The World .

"Ministers say the soar in figures is a result of Labour's mishandling of immigration policy . Britain could be hosting enough illegal immigrants to fill three cities the size of Newcastle, according to border officials. A Home Office report says there may be as many as 863,000 illegal migrants – 70 per cent of whom are living in London. The study also reveals that 10,000 foreigners who had no legal right to live in Britain have been granted permission to stay under the so-called 14-year rule. It means they managed to stay in the country for so long without being booted out that the Government has now given up the fight. Ministers say the situation is a legacy of Labour's shambolic handling of border controls. The illegal immigrants are a mixture of those who sneaked into Britain in the back of lorries and those who arrived on visas but never went home. Officials, overwhelmed by the foreign prisoners scandal and a deluge of asylum claims, did not have the resources to track them down. The 'robust estimate' of how many illegals are living in the UK comes from the London School of Economics, and is included in a study titled Practical Measures for Reducing Irregular Migration.  The LSE found there were between 417,000 and 863,000 illegals living in the UK, with a central figure of 613,000. Ministers accept the figures. The Home Office says the top five countries from which the illegals have arrived are believed to be India, Nigeria, Pakistan, China, and Bangladesh. This is based on the nationalities of those people the authorities have detected. Minister for Immigration Mark Harper promised a tougher stance on illegal migrants . Last night Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'It's no surprise that after years of uncontrolled immigration, we have a sizeable illegal immigrant population in Britain. 'We are determined to get immigration under control, and in the past year net migration has fallen by a quarter. We also want to get tough on illegal immigration.' The illegal population – more far outstrips the 275,000  who live in Newcastle – will add sharply to the number of foreign-born nationals living here legally. Earlier this month, the official Census showed that 7.5million people who were born abroad were living here in 2011, of whom more than half have arrived since 2001. The Home Office study sets out for the first time how many beneficiaries there have been of the 14-year rule. This states that, once a migrant has lived in the UK for this long, he or she will have established a right to a family life and should not normally be kicked out. Between 2004 and 2011, 9,266 'irregular migrants' were granted permission to stay, including a record figure of 2,062 in 2010. The total is now understood to have breached the 10,000 barrier.","Figures show 70% of the 863,000 illegals live in London .

"A three-year-old boy has been murdered by the mafia, who then burnt his body, after a drug debt between rival clans went unpaid, investigators believe. The body of Nicola Campolongo was found over the weekend in a burned-out car behind an abandoned farmhouse. Alongside it were the corpses of his grandfather Salvatore Iannicelli, 52, and his girlfriend Ibtissa Touss, 27. The killing of a toddler has shocked even hardened investigators in Italy, where bosses have long perpetrated the myth that the mob doesn't hurt women and children. In reality there have been many innocent victims of the criminal organisations over the years. Scroll down for video . Investigators believe Nicola Campolongo was killed over an unpaid drug debt . The body of Nicola Campolongo was found over the weekend in a burned-out car . The killing of a toddler has shocked even hardened investigators in Italy . Crime scene investigators working at a burnt car where three burnt bodies were found in Cassano allo Ionio, Calabria province, southern Italy . On the roof of the torched car was a single unmarked 50 cent coin, an apparent symbol from the assassins that Mr Iannicelli had not paid his debt. Police in Cosenza, in the far south of Italy, believe both the killers and victims hail from clans affiliated to the Ndrangheta mafia. The Ndrangheta, based in Calabria, the toe of Italy, are the country's richest and most powerful mob, with global ties that include Colombian drug cartels and the IRA. They supply an estimated 80 per cent of Europe's cocaine. Nicola's mother, Antonia Iannicelli, and father, also Nicola Campolongo, who are both in prison for drug trafficking offences . The grandfather was caring for little Nicola, nicknamed Coco, because the boy's father and mother, Mr Iannicelli's daughter, are both in jail. They were arrested a year ago as part of operation Tsunami, a crackdown on the mafia trafficking of hallucinogenic drugs. The child's uncle had reported the group missing after Mr Iannicelli, who had previously spent time in jail, did not return home for his court-imposed curfew, which was between 8pm and 8am. Police in Cosenza, in the far south of Italy, believe both the killers and victims hail from clans affiliated to the Ndrangheta mafia . Investigating prosecutor Franco Giacomantonio said: 'Every line has now been crossed. 'How can anyone kill a three year old boy in this way? In many years of work, I think this will be the most brutal murder that it has been my duty to investigate.' Social justice campaigner Franco Corbelli, who knows the family, said the little boy had already suffered great injustice and lack of humanity having been thrown in jail with his mother when she was first arrested a year ago. He said: 'I have done everything I could have done. I have fought for more than a year to save this child and his young mother. But everything I have done has been for nothing. 'Ferocity, barbarism and cruelty have prevailed and were not stopped even when confronted by a child.' One of the clans' most famous victims was 11-year-old Domenico Gabriele who was shot while playing football in 2009 and died in hospital three months later. Another, 13-year-old Giuseppe di Matteo was strangled and dissolved in acid by the Sicilian mob after his father turned state witness in 1996.","Nicola Campolongo was found over the weekend in southern Italy .

"Three-time major winner Billy Casper has died at the age of 83, the US PGA Tour has announced. Casper, who won the US Open in 1959 and 1966 and the Masters in 1970, claimed 51 PGA Tour titles in total between 1956 and 1975 to sit seventh on the Tour's all-time victories list. The PGA Tour said on its website: 'Billy Casper, one of the most prolific PGA TOUR winners in history and long considered among the sport's finest putters, suffered a heart attack and died Saturday at his home in Springview, Utah. He was 83.' Three-time major winner Billy Casper has died at the age of 83 . Casper (left) is helped into the Masters jacket after his 1970 win by '69 champion George Archer . According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, which quoted an email from Casper's son Bob, Casper had spent five weeks after Thanksgiving in hospital battling pneumonia. He had since returned home. Jack Nicklaus was among those to pay their tributes to San Diego native Casper. The 75-year-old Nicklaus, who won a record 18 major golf titles in his career, said on his Facebook page: 'I have said many times that during my career, when I looked up at a leaderboard, I wasn't just looking to see where a (Arnold) Palmer or a (Gary) Player or a (Lee) Trevino was. 'I was also checking to see where Billy Casper was. Billy had tremendous confidence. He just believed in himself. You knew when you played against Billy Casper, Billy would not beat himself. 'You want to talk about someone who could perform under pressure, if you wanted someone to get up and-down for you, Billy Casper was your man. I think it is fair to say that Billy was probably under-rated by those who didn't play against him. Those who did compete against him, knew how special he was.'

Casper plays to the crowd while playing for the US Ryder Cup team in October 1965 . Casper hit out of a trap during the Masters playoff at Augusta during his victory in 1970 . Quoted on the PGA Tour website, Player added: 'I played a lot with Billy, and I always thought Billy had a wonderful short game. The way he managed the golf course - he had tremendous course management, which not a lot of people talk about. 'They talk about elongating, but that's not what wins golf tournaments; it's a great short game, the kinds of games we see with Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. They are not good drivers of the ball and yet, they've been No. 1 and No. 2.

Di, who is mother to four-year-old Ryland, said: 'I have got to the stage when I can fund my life through entering competitions, which is amazing. 'I've had Christmas sorted since the beginning of the year, and I have a huge stock pile of presents which I stash away all year round.' Di's first big win was an all expenses paid trip to Iceland in 1997, which she won after entering a competition hosted by Smirnoff Ice Vodka. Di said: 'It was a fantastic trip and my first big win. It really gave me a taste for a winning lifestyle so I started entering more and more competitions. 'I soon learnt the tips and tricks to win and it's all about where people find the competitions and how much effort needs to be put in. 'As a rule, it's better to enter the competitions which take more time and effort as less people are likely to enter. Di will scour the internet finding competitions, as well as ringing up phone-ins, and filling out newspaper quizzes (left), entering over 400 competitions a week, receiving prizes nearly daily (right) Di, here on a trip to Spain she won, spends only around two hours a day entering competitions . Di was able to take husband Rob to an all expenses paid trip to the Grand Prix in Brazil . Di spends around two hours a day entering competitions, which can be as simple as sharing a link on social media, or something more time consuming such as taking fun photos and she shares her experiences and tips on her blog, Superlucky.me. Di will scour the internet finding competitions, as well as ringing up phone-ins, and filling out newspaper quizzes. Di's hobby, which has now become her career, has allowed her to try a whole range of experiences . Over the past years Di has managed to win a whole host of electricals including five iPods, two Xboxes, two computers and three digital cameras, as well as three televisions in just this year alone. Total: £25,500 . Di's biggest win was a £13,000 VW Beetle but she has also blagged all inclusive trips around the world to destinations such as Iceland, Japan, Paris, Antiga and Spain. Di even managed to blag £7,500 cash which helped pay for her wedding as well as a flying lesson and Glastonbury tickets. Di said: 'My favourite competitions are the ones which my family can get involved in too. I like the competitions which my son Ryland can take part in, because it means I'm enjoying time with my family as well as having the chance to win a prize. 'I am in the process of putting together an e-Book about how my hobby turned into my job and I want people to realise that entering competitions can really make a difference to their life. 'Luckily, my husband has a good sense of humour when it comes to my comping and it makes life more exciting.' Di said: 'It's a fabulous feeling to get the phone call to say you have won big. 'I look forward to the postman turning up to see what he has for me in the post. 'And it's great that I can treat my family and friends as well. I've won three TVs this year and I happily gave one to my parents and one to my niece. 'I have managed to kit out my whole house, get toys and clothes for my son and even take my family on amazing holiday every year, all for free. 'All I need now is a new kitchen, so I'm working on a few competitions which will help me get one hopefully. And it's not just magazine competitions and Facebook giveaways, Di has won £10,000 from game shows over the years including Supermarket Sweep and the National Lottery Show, 1 vs 100. Di said: 'It's such an exciting thing to do and I am totally addicted. Each win is fantastic and some of the prizes have been life-changing. 'I want people to realise how easy it can be to win on competitions and how much fun it can be too.' 1. Be choosy . Di said: 'Decide what you want to win and make a wish list of prizes – from small things like vouchers and tickets to big things like a holiday or a kitchen. If you focus on finding and entering competitions to win those prizes, you'll find the hobby more manageable. 'The first step to winning those dream prizes is to find relevant companies on the internet, Facebook and Twitter – follow them, like them and join their email lists so you'll be the first to hear about new competitions.' 2. Get a new email address . Di advises competition wannabes to set up a new email account especially for comping- to filter out the hundreds of emails compers will received when they enter. 3. Always look for the word 'win' Di said: 'Whether I'm in the supermarket, on the train, in WHSmith or in a waiting room, I always look out for the magic word - win. You'll be surprised where you find competitions – on products, in magazines, on bus stops… If you have a smartphone you can enter most comps there and then. 'You can also use your phone to search Twitter or Google for comps if you find yourself waiting around – you can always favourite or bookmark them to enter later on.' 4. Put the effort in . Di said: 'The majority of people who enter competitions don't like competitions which take a lot of creativity or effort, but these are the best ones to enter because they offer the best chance of winning. 'If something takes a bit more effort, often you may be the only entrant!' 5. Go local . Di said finding low entry competitions is the key to winning lots and advises checking local magazines, newspapers and shopping centres. Di said: 'My top tip is to tune in to your local radio stations as the text and phone-in comps get very few entries!'","Di spends around two hours a day entering competitions, doing 400 a week .

"Harry Kane was 'remarkable' as Tottenham secured a north London derby win that Ryan Mason says has the top-four contenders abuzz with excitement. Arsenal made the short journey to White Hart Lane looking for a sixth straight win and got off to the ideal start as Mesut Ozil volleyed home. Spurs, though, responded manfully, peppering the visitors' goal before Kane finally beat David Ospina shortly after half-time. Harry Kane celebrates scoring during Tottenham's 2-1 victory over Arsenal on Saturday . Kane was praised as 'remarkable' by his Tottenham team-mate Ryan Mason (right) Things were to get better still for Mauricio Pochettino's men as the in-form England Under-21s striker continued his superb recent form, heading home at the death to secure a 2-1 win in his first north London derby. 'He is remarkable,' Mason of his friend and team-mate. 'He leads the line on his own and does it unbelievably well. 'You can see the way he is at the moment that he is one fire and can't stop scoring.'

Kane is mobbed by Mason, Bentaleb and his team-mates after scoring his second against Arsenal . They are, though, more than capable back-ups, with Spurs boasting a squad depth which makes Mason confident they can qualify for the Champions League. 'We believe - of course we do,' he said. 'We did the same thing to Chelsea a little while ago and hopefully we can keep doing well and stay up there. 'It will be difficult (to make the top four) but we are confident in ourselves. 'We're on a good run and the team spirit is amazing. Everyone gets on with each other well. 'It is great to come in off the back of a win and we are buzzing.

"Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini has insisted there is a lot more to come from him at Old Trafford. The 27-year-old Belgian had a difficult start to life at the club, failing to score in 21 appearances last season, but he told The Sun it wasn't just himself who struggled under David Moyes last campaign. 'Last season was a bad season for everyone, not just me,' said Fellaini. 'The criticism went to me because I was the first transfer of  Moyes. I accept that. Marouane Fellaini insists there is more to come from him at Manchester United . Fellaini celebrates after setting up Juan Mata's opener against Cambridge United . 'But it's a team game. The team wasn't performing well, we didn't win. It was hard.' Fellaini also admitted he felt sorry for his former boss Moyes, who brought him to Manchester United in a deadline day deal after working together for five years at Everton. 'You have to win if you want to stay as manager,' the midfielder added. 'Last year was a bad experience for him.' Fellaini insists that everyone at the club had a bad season under David Moyes, not just him . Fellaini was brought to Old Trafford after five years under Moyes at Everton . 2014/15 has marked a vast improvement in Fellaini's form, scoring three times in 13 appearances so far.

"Nigel Pearson is set to escape punishment from the Football Association despite appearing to put his hands around the neck of Crystal Palace midfielder Jame McArthur. The Leicester City boss was involved in an extraordinary clash with the Palace midfielder in the dying minutes of the Foxes' 1-0 home defeat on Saturday. However, FA rules dictate that English football's governing body can only act upon the incident if it is mentioned in the referee's match report - but the official saw the incident and took no action at the time.

McArthur laughs and smiles as Pearson appears to put his arms around the throat of the midfielder . Therefore match referee Lee Mason, who came across to the touchline once fourth official Peter Bankes have calmed the situation down, is unlikely to include the incident in his match report - preventing the FA from taking any disciplinary action. Also, on Sports Lobster, McArthur himself played down the significance of the incident. The Palace midfielder explained: 'Situation with me and Nigel Pearson is getting blown out of proportion.' Pearson has already been given a one-match ban by the FA and a £10,000 fine this season for telling a supporter to 'f*** off and die'. During his side's 3-1 defeat to Liverpool at the King Power Stadium at the beginning of December, Pearson was filmed shouting at the fan before being charged by the Football Association.

However, on Saturday, the Leicester City manager was accidentally upended as Leicester's Marc Albrighton and McArthur collided - leading to the incident on the touchline.

"Harry Redknapp has expressed an interest in returning to football as part of a consortium. The 67-year-old, who resigned as manager of Queens Park Rangers last week to have knee surgery, has been linked with a group of investors looking to buy a club near to his Dorset home. He confirmed the speculation on BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme but didn't reveal any further details. Harry Redknapp is considering investing in a club close to his Dorset home after stepping down as QPR boss . Redknapp, who requires knee surgery, did not rule out a return to management if the right job came up . 'It's something that could interest me, I'd just like to be involved,' Redknapp said. 'I spoke to people about one or two bits and pieces that may come up but at the moment it's not gone that far.' The former Bournemouth, West Ham, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager also refused to rule out a return to the managerial hotseat if the right job came along. He said: 'I'll get my knee sorted, I'll go back and see the specialist for whatever he feels needs doing. 'I haven't really done my rehab, that's been my biggest problem, I'm always too busy to spend an hour getting my quads right. Les Ferdinand was appointed QPR's director of football following Redknapp's departure from Loftus Road . Chris Ramsey oversaw coaching duties from the home dug-out for Saturday's match with Southampton . Tim Sherwood, the former Spurs coach, is the favourite to take over at Loftus Road . 'I'd miss the buzz of football. It would have to be something I really wanted to do if I was going to have another go. 'If anything came up that was interesting I'd have to look at it.' Tim Sherwood, another former Spurs manager, is the favourite to replace Redknapp and would work alongside caretakers Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey. 'I would think there's every chance Tim would go there,' added Redknapp. The Hoops remain in the relegation zone, a point shy of safety, following their late defeat at home to Southampton on Saturday.","Redknapp linked with consortium looking to invest in a club .

"Her distraught family had gathered around her body to say their final farewells. Mother-of-four Tasleem Rafiq had suffered a heart attack and medics had not been able to revive her. Doctors warned that even if they could restart the 52-year-old’s heart, she would have suffered irreversible brain damage. Unusual: Tasleem Rafiq's recovery has baffled doctors at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, who are describing it as 'a miracle,' according to her family . But just as her grieving children . tried to come to terms with their loss, Mrs Rafiq apparently came back . from the dead – and spoke to her stunned daughter. And by the next morning, the patient was joking and chatting with her family as if nothing had happened. Mrs Rafiq, who was diagnosed with  multiple sclerosis aged 32 and cannot walk, said she feels ‘very lucky’ to have survived. The grandmother, who did not want to . be pictured, added: ‘God will take  you when he chooses. Everyone was . praying and God said: “I am going to leave this lady.” I am a very lucky . mother.’ The ordeal began when Mrs Rafiq collapsed at her terraced family home in Reading. An ambulance was called and medics . started trying to resuscitate her at home, continuing in the ambulance . and at the accident and emergency department at Royal Berkshire . Hospital. Mrs Rafiq’s son Fezaen, 28, claimed: . ‘We were waiting [in the A&E department] when the doctor came out . and said: “I have to tell you that we have been trying to get your . mother’s heart started for 45 minutes and we haven’t had any luck. Unfortunately she has died.”’ This was at 11.30am, he added, and the devastated family requested some private time with Mrs Rafiq’s body to say goodbye. After Mrs Rafiq collapsed, an ambulance was called and medics took her to hospital (stock image) They were warned that, because their . mother had been injected with adrenalin, her body would make involuntary . movements which should not be mistaken for signs of life. Fezaen said: ‘We were sitting with . her, praying. I was on the right and my brother was on the left when he . said, “She’s looking at you”. ‘We called the nurse and asked if that was normal. She said yes, it was quite normal.’ But over the next two hours, this . happened several more times. Eventually, a doctor examined Mrs Rafiq . again, and confirmed that there was in fact a faint pulse. However, the family was warned that . though she was clinging on to life, she would have suffered irreversible . brain damage and was expected to die soon. Doctors also advised that if . she had a second cardiac arrest, she should not be resuscitated. Despite this, the family stayed by her bedside, praying for a miracle. At around 10pm, Mrs Rafiq’s daughter Shabana, who was sat holding her mother’s hand, thought she felt her pulling it away. She said: ‘Mum, if I have done . something to upset you, tell me.’ To her astonishment, Mrs Rafiq turned . to her and replied: ‘What have you done to upset me?’ After collapsing on September 14, Mrs Rafiq was discharged and allowed to go home on October 2. Her family have claimed that  at the . time, doctors described  her recovery as a ‘miracle’.  However, a . spokesman for Royal Berkshire Hospital said that Mrs Rafiq had never . officially been declared dead. He added: ‘It was felt that she was . unlikely to survive and it is very fortunate that she had not suffered . brain damage but at no point was she dead. She had a very faint pulse . which may have gone undetected. ‘Her recovery was unusual. Everyone is very pleased that she didn’t suffer any permanent damage.’ David Mossop, lead consultant in . emergency care medicine at the hospital, said resuscitation protocol had . been followed correctly. After Mrs Rafiq’s heart had stopped . for 45 minutes, and with blood tests showing profound lack of oxygen, a . severe amount of brain damage would be expected, he said. But Mrs Rafiq . suffered no effects from her ordeal, other than some temporary memory . loss. Mrs Rafiq’s family are adamant that staff at the hospital had said that she had died. Fezaen added: ‘It is not something we . would mistake; they told us she was dead. But she is doing well now, . there have been no lasting ill effects on her.’ Mrs Rafiq’s eldest son Yousif said: . ‘It was obviously very traumatic, the doctor had said she passed away so . we started breaking the news to the rest of the family and relatives . began making their way to the hospital. ‘But then she started to squeeze my sister’s hand... the doctor said it was a miracle.’ Diagnosing death can be an ‘inexact science’, according to Tony Calland, chairman of the British Medical Association’s medical ethics committee.He said: ‘Death is like appendicitis – it is one of the easiest and most difficult conditions to diagnose. You are always going to get bizarre cases.’ He added it was not unheard of for a pathologist to start a post-mortem examination ‘and then the patient swallows’. There have been several cases around  the world of people being declared dead  by doctors – and then apparently coming back to life. Earlier this year, mourners in Egypt cheered when the ‘dead’ body they were burying woke up. Hamdi Hafez al-Nubi, a 28-year-old waiter, had been declared dead after suffering a heart attack at work. His body was being prepared for burial when another doctor, sent to sign his death certificate, discovered he was still warm and managed to revive him. And in April a 95-year-old Chinese woman climbed out of her own coffin six days after she was declared dead following a fall. Under Chinese tradition, Li Xiufeng was placed in a coffin kept in her house so friends and relatives could pay their respects. But the day before the funeral, neighbours found an empty coffin and later discovered her in the kitchen cooking. In Tasleem Rafiq’s case, it appears that she had a pulse all along, but that it became so faint that it was undetectable.","Tasleem Rafiq 'dead' after Royal Berkshire Hospital medics spent 45 minutes trying to re-start heart .

"A spirited Scotland side inspired by Stuart Hogg came up just short against a French outfit that held on for an opening day Six Nations win. Vern Cotter’s side gave as good as they got for most of the match but five penalties from Camille Lopez secured the win for the French. Scotland replacement winger Dougie Fife was both saint and sinner for the Scots. It was his try from a pass from prop Euan Murray that gave Scotland hope. But it was also his indiscipline when he threw the ball away in frustration gave the home side three easy, vital points.

Penalties: Lopez (5) Scotland XV: Hogg; Seymour, Bennett, Dunbar, Visser; Russell, Laidlaw; Dickinson, Ford, Murray, R Gray, J Gray; Harley, Cowan, Beattie. Replacements: Brown, Reid, Cross, Hamilton, Strokosch, Hidalgo-Clyne, Horne, Fife. Tries: Fife . Penalties: Laidlaw (1) Despite the defeat the spirit shown by the Scots in Paris is a good omen for the rest of the Six Nations. As for the French they struggled to find the right tempo and only the kicking of Lopez kept the scoreboard ticking over for them . Scotland got off to the worst possible start when Blair Cowan was penalised for holding on which gave Camille Lopez an easy penalty to open the scoring. Captain Greig Laidlaw drew the scores level with one of his own after the French collapsed a scrum. Lopez increased the home sides lead with a penalty from in front of the posts just before Scotland were dealt a major blow when winger Tommy Seymour went off with a hip injury after just 17 minutes to be replaced by Dougie Fife. Stuart Hogg’s penalty attempt from within his own half drifted aimlessly wide but even attempting a kick from so far out showed the confidence the Scotland full-back was showing. Minutes later Hogg was at it again with his jinking run nearly leading to a Scotland try. After four phases of attacking play Finn Russell made a real hash of a relatively simple drop goal attempt. Hogg was nearly in at the corner in another move with the full-back held up just short. Three minutes before the break Lopez put over his third penalty of the match. Hogg was again at the heart of the action starting a sweeping move that ended with prop Euan Murray playing in replacement Fife for a try. Laidlaw’s conversion attempt came back off a post. France scrum half Rory Kockott winds up a box kick during the opening exchanges at the Stade de France . The French tried their best to take the game to the Scots early in the second half but struggled to find a way through. Try scorer Fife then gifted France three points when he threw the ball away in frustration and was penalised by referee Nigel Owens. Lopez made the most of the Scotland’s petulance by putting over his fourth penalty. He missed his fifth attempt that came back off a post but the French had the upperhand.

The Scotland cause wasn’t helped when Johnnie Beattie was yellow carded just after the hour mark for pulling down a maul. The small margins between success and failure came when Tim Visser just failed to connect to a pass that was taken off his fingers by Yoann Huget. The French winger sped up the line only for a great tackle from Bennett to stop him.

"Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen believes the emergence of exciting teenage winger Jordon Ibe is evidence the club's continued investment in young talent will pay off. The 19-year-old made only the second Premier League start of his career and put in a man-of-the-match performance in the 224th Merseyside derby, which finished as a goalless draw at Goodison Park. Excluding Steven Gerrard, the Reds' other attack-minded players in midfield and up front were Raheem Sterling (20), Philippe Coutinho (22), Alberto Moreno (22) and Jordan Henderson (24) - and even Daniel Sturridge, coming off the bench, is still only 25. Jordon Ibe produced a man of the match performance for Liverpool in their derby draw with Everton . Ibe, making only his second Premier League appearance, hit the post during a vibrant display at Goodison . Joe Allen believes the emergence of Ibe is further proof that Liverpool's investment in youth is working . Youthful exuberance, and the pace which accompanies it, has been a factor in the team's recent rejuvenation and Ibe's surprise inclusion only adds to that. Playing on the right side of midfield rather than his accustomed winger role the youngster, bought from Wycombe Wanderers three years ago after 11 first-team appearances, produced Liverpool's best chance with a run and shot against the post with goalkeeper Joel Robles beaten. His inclusion justified manager Brendan Rodgers' decision to recall him from a loan spell at Derby last month and Allen believes Ibe will complement the growing band of influential young players. 'He is an incredible talent. I saw him as a 16/17-year-old a couple of years ago and I thought, 'This guy has everything to go really far',' he said. 'He came in and proved that and with that performance he will be staking a claim for the starting XI. 'His raw attributes - his pace and power - and his ability to beat people for pace with the ball is frightening at times. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers recalled Ibe from a loan spell at Derby County . Ibe was part of the Birmingham City side that avoided relegation from the Championship last season . Liverpool were seventh in the Premier League table after the Goodison Park draw . 10 Tottenham Hotspur (H) 14 Crystal Palace (A) FA Cup Fifth round . 19 Besiktas (H) Europa League Round of 32, first leg . 22 Southampton (A) 26 Besiktas (A) Europa League Round of 32, second leg . 'That, coupled with the hard work he puts in, combined with the experience he has had on loan and getting games, has helped him come back stronger. 'He always seems confident when he goes out to play. He is a great player to have in our squad. 'That is what this club have been building over the last three years. 'They are still all young players and that is what is great from our point of view. 'Imagine these players developing over the next few years and what they are capable of and it is a massive thing for Liverpool and we will reap the rewards of that.' Allen himself is looking for more pitch time after another injury-troubled season and he may just get that wish after replacing Lucas Leiva just 15 minutes into the derby. Raheem Sterling, 20, is another successful young star in Liverpool ranks . Brazilian star Philippe Coutinho, 22, has been in excellent form this season for the Reds . The Brazil midfielder had been carrying a thigh problem and he could be out for a number of weeks if he has aggravated it, which would open the door for Allen. 'When you are on the bench you always know there's that chance that someone might pick up an injury or something might happen,' he added. 'From a personal point of view it was great to be involved in such a big game; at the same time you feel gutted for your team-mate who has come off injured. 'I think injuries have been an issue for me. Thankfully, I've never had any serious ones in my time here but my season has been broken up by minor injuries and each time it takes you a little while to get back going and back to the level you want to be at. 'It's been frustrating but hopefully I can stay fit now and help us finish the season strongly. Lucas Leiva has aggravated a thigh injury and could be out for a number of weeks . The injury to Lucas could open the door for more game time for his replacement on Saturday, Joe Allen . 'I'm confident that if I do stay fit and get myself in this team I can show what I can do.' Liverpool host Tottenham on Tuesday, a match they really need to win if they want to start making a move towards securing Champions League qualification for next season. 'We will give everything to get in that top four,' said the Wales midfielder. 'We have ground to make up and we have work to do but it starts in our next game against Spurs. 'They have picked up some points recently and had a great win against Arsenal so we will need to make sure we give everything and be on top of our game and hopefully get those three points. 'I think at the start of the season they are a team you expect to be there or thereabouts and it makes for an exciting game.'","Ibe, 19, was impressive in Liverpool's derby stalemate with Everton .

"QPR striker Charlie Austin is set to miss just one match after limping away from Loftus Road on crutches after their 1-0 defeat to Southampton on Saturday. A long-term injury to their 13-goal top scorer would have been disastrous for the west Londoners in their bid to survive in the Barclays Premier League. However, a statement released on the club's official Twitter account on Sunday morning read: '@chazaustin9 has suffered bruising to his right foot and will miss Tuesday's trip to @SunderlandAFC. Nothing too serious #QPR.' QPR striker and top goalscorer Charlie Austin could be out with injury for the rest of the season . Austin has been in superb form for The Hoops this season and has scored 13 goals in 19 league games . And Austin himself followed that up by tweeting: 'Scan done.

"A British woman has appeared in a photography exhibition celebrating the world's best facial hair after growing a beard for seven years. Harnaam Kaur is the only woman to appear in the collection of photographs after speaking out against critics of her appearance. The 23-year-old from Slough, Berkshire, has been growing a beard since the age of 16 after being diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition which causes excess hair growth. Harnaam Kaur is the only woman who appears in the collection of photographs celebrating the 60 best beards in the world . Miss Kaur is one of 60 people chosen to appear in the exhibition, Project 60. 'It’s incredible to be the only bearded woman among all these men. It makes me feel really strong,' she said. “And raising awareness for such a good cause is like a cherry on the top. After being bullied as a teen, the teaching assistant tried waxing, shaving and bleaching to hide her facial hair. Once baptized Sikh, a religion which forbids cutting body hair, the 23-year-old decided to embrace her body as it was. 'When I first started growing my beard it was for religious reasons but as the years have gone by I’ve kept it for more personal reasons. 'It makes me feel like a brave, confident woman who isn't afraid to break society’s norms,' she added. Project 60 marks the launch of Beard Season - a non-profit organisation seeking to raise awareness of skin cancer by urging people to grow facial hair through winter. Photographer, Brock Elbank, said: 'We’ve had a lot of interest from some truly amazing people and Harnaam is one of them. 'To have her on board is such an exciting prospect for us. 'I like the fact that she has embraced having a beard and she’s very striking with it. 'She’s a really great girl and she told us her story and we loved her positivity. Miss Kaur shaved, waxed and bleached her beard as a teen after being bullied by others but now says she is happy with her appearance after letting the beard grow for seven years . The 23-year-old has polycystic ovary syndrome which causes excess hair growth on the face and body . PCOS is a common condition affecting a woman's ovaries, with three main features. These are cysts developing in their ovaries, the ovaries not regularly releasing eggs, and high levels of male hormones - 'androgens'. The syndrome is associated with irregular hormone levels in the body, including insulin. There is no cure for the condition, but medicine is available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth and fertility problems. Most women with the condition can get pregnant - but sometimes need a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling. This involves destroying tissue in the ovaries making androgens including testosterone. 'The whole project is about fighting melanoma and Harnaam is our secret weapon. 'For me it’s about diversity of character, not just beards. It’s about why they have it and the pride they carry by growing it.' Australian Beard Season founder Scott Maggs said he hoped the exhibition would educate people about skin cancer. He said: 'Four years ago I lost one of my best mates, Wes Bonny, to melanoma at the age of 26. 'At his wake a group of us decided to start something which would encourage more people to have regular skin checks. 'Not many blokes our age had beards back then and because his melanoma was on his neck we decided to cover up from the sun and let our beards grow, encouraging everyone who asked about them to have a skin check and share Wes’ story. 'Thousands of people have visited their GP or skin clinic because of what we’ve started, and every week I’ll receive messages from people who would not be here today were it not for our friendly advice.' Seventy-four-year-old Frank Moon, from Leamington Spa has been growing his beard from the age of 20, and is also featured in the exhibition . Michael Legge from Rotherham (left) poses for a portrait (left) and Beard Season founder, Australian Scot Maggs, (right) also appears in the collection . He added: 'Harnaam has such a magnificent message about the power of self confidence and positive body image. 'She has inspired millions around the world and it is a privilege to have her involved with Project60.' Harnaam’s portrait, as well as the 59 others, will be displayed in London later in the year.

"Tottenham Hotspur's starting XI exuded confidence and maturity in their 2-1 north London derby victory over Arsenal - despite Mauricio Pochettino fielding the side with the youngest average age in the Premier League this season. The 11 Spurs players who started the match at White Hart Lane had an average age of just 24 years and 37 days.

Brendan Rodgers sent out a side with an average age of just 24 years and 47 days against Aston Villa last month - and they came out as 2-0 victors. There are only two other teams in the Premier League who have started sides with an average age of less than 25 years this season. They are Manchester United - with Louis van Gaal fielding a side averaging 24 years and 153 days during their 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion in October - and Newcastle United - when Alan Pardew sent out a Magpies XI with an average age of 24 years and 225 days for their 2-0 win at The Hawthorns in November.

"Jacqui Lambie, Palmer United Party senator, told radio listeners her ideal man was rich and 'well hung' Senator Jacqui Lambie caused shock on the airwaves this morning, telling listeners that she wanted a man with 'a package between their legs' and asking a 22-year-old caller if he was 'well-hung'. The Palmer United Party senator for Tasmania appeared on Heart 107.3 this morning where it was revealed she had not been in a relationship for 11 years. Radio hosts Kim Napier and Dave Noonan offered to find her a love match and invited callers who wanted to date the senator to phone in. Ms Lambie revealed her criteria for a man, saying: 'They must have heaps of cash and they've got to have a package between their legs, let's be honest. 'I don't need them to speak, they don't even need to speak.' Ms Lambie has since apologised for her comments to a 22-year-old caller named Jamie, who was interested in dating the 43-year-old mother-of-two, though he did not seem to know who Ms Lambie was and sounded surprised to learn she was a federal senator. 'A lot of people laughed ... (but) some people may have got offended,' she said in a statement. Using a joke to cover the embarrassment of discussing her love life on a light-hearted radio segment would cause her political enemies to pounce. 'But the reality is I was talking with Kim and Dave on Heart FM, not Sarah Ferguson on the ABC.' Scroll down for video . Rookie senator Jacqui Lambie, pictured left with Clive Palmer and right addressing the Senate, has caused controversy again this morning . During the segment, Jamie said he fulfilled Ms Lambie's first criterion, having inherited 'a small fortune'. Ms Lambie then expressed concern that at the age of 22, Jamie might be inexperienced and 'might not be able to handle Jacqui Lambie', to which he replied 'I've been about a fair bit.' Finally, Ms Lambie asked Jamie if he was 'well-hung'. 'Hung like a donkey,' he replied. Ms Lambie then revealed that her 24-year-old son also believed he was hung like a donkey, before stating that her son 'would be cringing' at her comments. The rookie senator caused a stir earlier this month when she told ABC radio that Tony Abbott was a 'political psychopath' who had put his daughters' lives in danger by 'parading' them for political gain on the campaign trail last year. A few days after the controversial comments, Ms Lambie took another swipe at the prime minister, saying he needed 'a bucket of cement' to toughen up if he couldn't cop her criticism. The comments attracted national media attention and Senator Lambie later apologised. Jacqui made the controversial comments during an interview with Kim Napier and Dave Noonan on Heart 107.3 .","Jacqui Lambie is the controversial rookie Tasmanian PUP senator .

"Ollie Proudlock and Joey Essex may have been widely mocked for their love of feminine floral shirts - but it seems that the joke is on us, because men everywhere are embracing flower power this summer. New sales figures from fashion data analysts Editd show that sales of men's floral pieces are up 130 per cent since last year - and Asos has already sold out of its floral suit for men. The seeds of the flower trend were sown at the SS14 men's shows, with heavy hitter Prada sending models down the runway clad in huge lotus prints, while Christopher Kane worked graphic lilies into his collection. Setting the trends: We may have mocked Joey Essex, left, and Made In Chelsea's Ollie Proudlock, right, for their love of all things floral - but sales are up 130 per cent and if men want to be on-trend this summer, it's time to embrace flower power . Since then, fashion-forward men such as Made In Chelsea's Ollie Proudlock, Nick Grimshaw and even Kanye West have all been embracing the look. Speaking to MailOnline, a spokesperson for Asos said: 'There's been a slow burning under-current around florals for the last couple of seasons with the Hawaiian shirt dropping in and out of trend as the seasons come and go. 'More notably for us at Asos, the trend started with floral panels, pockets and yokes on tees but has now quite dramatically transitioned into full floral suits, formal shirt, shorts and polos. 'Sales are up approximately 90 per cent and we're definitely seeing a better reaction to darker base florals. With summer fast upon us, other high street retailers are rolling out floral themed designs. The classic Hawaiian print shirt - that wouldn't have looked out of place on your 60-year-old uncle a few years back - is big news over at Topman, while matchesfashion.com has nearly sold out of floral paisley espadrilles. Even Nike are working pretty flowers onto its super-cool trainers. How will you wear yours? Nick Grimshaw, left, who is known for being one step ahead of the trends, wears a subtle paisley shirt, while his friend goes for a loud and proud suit . But how on earth do you pull the look off without looking like a walking flowerbed? Thomas Merrigan, menswear writer at Oxbloodandwolf.wordpress.com, said: 'Florals have seen a strong comeback this year but they take some guts to . pull off. 'Avoid partnering with other prints, opt for solid colours . from the pattern for any accompanying garments. 'If you're looking to . experiment with floral, before going full blown floral shirt, try adding . an accent with a pocket square or a tie first.' Fresh off the runway: The floral trend was witnessed at Jonathan Saunders' SS14 show, left, and judging by the Burberry AW14 catwalk, right, it will be sticking around for a few more months . Speaking about the trend, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'I don’t know about you, but whenever I see floral prints at this time of year, one thing pops into my head: 'Florals, for spring. Groundbreaking!' as quoted by Miranda Priestly in the Devil Wears Prada. 'Givenchy's Riccardo Tisci didn't listen though. He went full on floral . for his SS14 pre-collection for us men.' 'It's definitely a Marmite . fashion situation. Personally, I think Tisci's bright pink flowers . are perfect for spring. 'They are too much, of course they are - this is . the man who printed Rottweilers on literally everything a few seasons . back. I'm a sucker for an all-over print but when is too much enough? Ever?'

"A British journalist who was being held by Ukrainian soldiers has been released. Graham Phillips, 35, tweeted to his 11,000 followers that he was 'ok' after being held for since Monday under armed guard and accused of being a Russian spy. The freelance reporter, who has been working for pro-Krelmin television station Russia Today, was detained in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine, before being taken to the defence ministry in the capital. Graham Phillips, 35, (seen left after his released and right in a profile photo) a British journalist who was being held by  Ukrainian soldiers has been released . Graham Phillips, 35, tweeted to his 11,000 followers that he had been released from custody early this morning after being held for 36 hours . Today the Nottingham-born blogger took to his Twitter page to let his followers know of his release, writing: 'I've just recently been released after being detained by Ukrainian authorities at #Mariupol yesterday. Was then transferred to Zaporozhye where I stayed the night, under armed guard. 'Removed by armed guard today, questioned thoroughly on my work for @RT_com. 'All my work in order, no charges, no deportation, no one laid a hand on me in anger, Ukrainian authorities treated me fairly. All ok.' He also addressed speculation that he had been holding a gun when he was detained and wrote on the social networking site: 'As for comments I was ""holding a firearm"".  Was holding my Canon camera,filming, just like I always do. Tomorrow will see if files still there.' Mr Phillips was detained at a checkpoint near Mariupol in eastern Ukraine on May 20 - he initially managed to make contact with colleagues. Nottingham-born Mr Phillips, 35, was working as a freelance reporter for Russia Today in Mariupol, east Ukraine . In the first interview since his release he told RT.com he had been taking photographs when the situation escalated as he questioned the solider about the situation in Ukraine when he told them he worked for RT. 'They started phoning people and then I was detained. I had my things taken off of me and interrogated quite thoroughly.' He . said he was taken away late on Monday night, around 9 pm local time, . after having spent 9 hours at the military checkpoint and he was . transferred to Zaporozhye in a police van at 'gun point,' to an army . base barracks. He said Ukrainian authorities accused him of being a spy because he worked for Russian television. 'They . were alright. I mean they fed me, they looked after me, but I was held . at a gun point and that was quite dramatic,' he told RT. He was released after being handed over to the consul of the British embassy in Kiev. RT reported that according to the ministry’s press service, Mr Phillips was detained for 'filming facilities which are forbidden from being filmed.' Yesterday the Foreign Office said government . officials were in contact with Ukrainian authorities and 'stand . ready' to provide consular assistance. Nottingham-born Mr Phillips, who grew up in Scotland, has been blogging about Ukraine for several months. In tweets posted before he was apprehended, he said he had secretly filmed at . Mariupol's city morgue where 11 bodies of people killed in bloody . clashes on May 9 were allegedly held. On May 19, a Ukrainian activist group called for him to be detained and deported, Russia Today claim. It came just weeks after one activist placed a $10,000 on Mr Phillips's head. Meanwhile President Vladimir Putin called the detention of two Russian journalists in Ukraine unacceptable on Wednesday and suggested it highlighted wider questions about the legitimacy of political power in Ukraine. The detention of the journalists, working for the pro-Kremlin Internet news outlet LifeNews, has added to tensions between Moscow and Kiev, which accuses Russia of destabilising Ukraine's Russian-speaking east ahead of a presidential vote on Sunday. 'It's absolutely unacceptable and of course the question arises over the legitimacy of all political procedures in Ukraine,' Putin said, speaking to journalists. Before he was detained he claimed to have secretly filmed hidden dead bodies after a clash on May 9 . Threats: He had been received threats for weeks from a Ukrainian activist group on Facebook . Ukraine's Defence Ministry said this week that soldiers had detained two unknown men who had identified themselves as journalists and were filming separatists. Putin also dismissed as 'nonsense' an allegation from the ministry saying the two journalists had been carrying portable air defence systems. Both Ukrainian and Russian media have traded accusations of lying during the conflict. Ukraine has temporarily blocked Russian television channels pending a court decision over their legality, but separatists who seized a television tower in eastern Ukraine have turned Russian channels back on, including Life News. The activist page shared a photo of Mr Phillips warning he is 'publishing the position of Ukrainian troops' Pro-Russian separatists have also abducted a number of Ukrainian journalists, including Irma Krat who runs an online news outlet and Serhiy Lefter. Russia's lower house of parliament, the Duma, passed a statement calling on Kiev to release the journalists Marat Saychenko and Oleg Sidyakin. 'We will succeed in freeing our two journalists and guarantee the freedom of their activities in Ukraine, including during large upcoming internal political events in Ukraine - the presidential election,' said the Chairwoman of Russia's Upper House of Parliament Valentina Matvienko.","Freelance reporter Graham Phillips was detained in Mariupol, east Ukraine .

"Need for 'proportionate scheme': Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson (pictured), has ruled that the law which requires people to disclose all previous convictions to employers breaches human rights . People who have been given police . cautions for theft will be free to work in care homes, schools and . hospitals despite their criminal past, under a human rights ruling. Currently, anybody applying to work with children or vulnerable adults must disclose any convictions or cautions they hold. The Criminal Records Bureau checks are designed to weed out applicants who could abuse positions of trust. But in a bombshell ruling yesterday . the Appeal Court said the system was a breach of Article 8 of Labour’s . Human Rights Act, the right to privacy. And it applies whether the . caution was received many years ago as a child or recently as an adult. Judges found in favour of a woman who . was blocked from taking a job in a care home eight years after she . received a police caution for theft from a shop in Sheffield while in . her early 40s. The Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, said the decision to bar her from the job had breached her human rights. He ruled that ‘requiring the . disclosure of all convictions and cautions relating to recordable . offences is disproportionate’. Her identity was kept secret. The judges in the Court of Appeal (above) said the CRB system is a breach of Article 8 of the Hmman Rights Act, the right to privacy . The case was brought to the Court of Appeal after campaign group Liberty intervened in . the case of 'T', a 21-year-old man who received warnings from Manchester . Police when he was 11 years old in connection with two stolen bikes. The . information was disclosed on two occasions: when he applied for a . part-time job at a local football club at the age of 17 and later when . he applied for a university course in sports studies. Mike . Pemberton, the solicitor who represented 'T', told Radio 5 Live: 'This . is a case where human rights equals common sense. 'You can’t argue that . something you did when you were 11 years old will blight you for the . rest of your life.' The ruling means employers could, in . future, be barred from knowing whether a potential employee has a theft . conviction. It raises the prospect of people who have admitted serious . dishonesty looking after care home residents, some with dementia. Last year, 38,400 cautions were given out for theft, all of which could now remain secret. The verdict also included the case of a . 17-year-old who failed to get a job at a sports club because he had to . disclose a police warning he had received for bicycle theft when he was . 11. Had the Appeal Court ruled only that . cautions given for minor crimes to juveniles should no longer be . included in CRB checks, there would have been little fuss. But because . the judgment found in favour of an adult it provoked anger at . Westminster. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This is . another classic example of judicial legislation under the Human Rights . Act – stretching human rights, and eroding the ability of those in . positions of trust to protect the vulnerable. This balance should be . decided by accountable law-makers.’ A government spokesman said: ‘The . protection of children and vulnerable groups must not be compromised. We . are disappointed by this judgment and are seeking leave to appeal to . the Supreme Court.’ While ruling that the current system . of CRB checks must be ripped-up, the judges did not specify exactly how . ministers must change the law to make it human rights compatible. Lord Dyson said only that a system of ‘filtering’ was required, to allow for irrelevant criminal records to be removed. It leaves ministers with a big . headache. One option is to say that all cautions will be excluded from . enhanced CRB checks. But this could have huge ramifications – 212,000 . criminals were punished in this way last year alone, many for serious . offences. The only certain outcome is that, . because judges have ruled on the specific case of the woman in her 40s, . it will no longer be lawful to insist a caution for theft must . automatically be disclosed. The ruling could mean hundreds of . thousands of people who have been made to disclose past convictions to . employers seeking compensation, if they missed out on the job. Criminal record checks were beefed up . after the case of Ian Huntley, who was jailed for life in 2003 for the . murder of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham, Cambridgeshire. He . had got a job as a school caretaker because his criminal links had not . been shared by Humberside Police. The ruling will raise fears that more relaxed checks on previous convictions will allow criminals to work in sensitive jobs such as at care homes. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) was established under the Police Act 1997 and launched in March 2002 following public concern about the safety of children, young people and vulnerable adults. It also aimed to reduce the risk of organisations being sued for employing convicted criminals who went on to abuse in the course of their duty. Changing rules: Criminal records checks were toughened up following the murders of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells (both left) by Ian Huntley (right) in 2002, but are now being relaxed by the Coalition government . Vetting was strengthened further with the introduction of the Independent Safegaurding Authority (ISA), which required all people working with vulnerable people and young children be checked. The ISA came into force in direct response to recommendations by the Bichard Inquiry following the murders of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells by Ian Huntley in 2002. Huntley had been suspected of a string of offences including rape, indecent assault and burglary. His only conviction before the murders was for riding an uninsured and unlicensed motorcycle, although a burglary charge had remained on file. However, there was debate whether he would have been caught if the rules had been in place at the time of his horrific crime. Last year, the government announced that millions of people who volunteer to help in schools, with sport or at charity events are to be freed from the red tape of criminal record checks. Ministers are scaling back legislation to exempt more than half of the nine million who have needed to go through Labour’s 'vetting and barring scheme' from the need to be officially checked. On December 1, 2012, the CRB and the ISA were merged to form the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).","Judges say disclosure of some crimes not compatible with human rights .

"Murderers could be given US-style jail sentences lasting more than 100 years, under plans being considered by ministers. David Cameron said 'life should mean life' as senior Conservatives draw up plans to change sentencing rules to overcome a ban on whole life terms being imposed by the European Court of Human Rights. Sentences lasting several decades are understood to be one of the options put forward in a review of Britain’s human rights laws, which will be published in the coming weeks. Whole-life term: Mark Bridger (left), 47, was sentenced in May last year for murdering Welsh schoolgirl April Jones. Ariel Castro (right), who kidnapped three women in Ohio, was sentenced last year to 1,000 years in jail . The Government, which is in an on-going row with the European court, is evaluating whether this would be the best way to give Britain the final say over sentencing. English law allows judges to impose ‘whole-life’ tariffs, effectively sentencing a criminal to die in jail. But the Strasbourg court said last year that such sentences were a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, because there was no possibility of a ‘right to review’. The court’s ruling means at least one multiple murderer has avoided a whole-life sentence. Mr Cameron said during a visit to Southampton today: 'What I think is very clear, there are some people who commit such dreadful crimes that they should be sent to prison and life should mean life. 'Whatever the European court has said, we must put in place arrangements to make sure that can continue.' Ministers have asked a panel to look at empowering judges to jail criminals for hundreds of years, which could have the same effect as a whole-life term. However a British criminal sentenced to 100 years in jail could still be potentially eligible to have their sentence reviewed or reduced for good behaviour. Warning: David Cameron, pictured on a visit to Southampton today, said life should mean life when sentences are handed down . A government source told the Daily Telegraph: ‘The European Court of Human Rights seems to be making decisions a million miles away from what the vast majority of the public think. ‘They don’t want any possibility of the most horrible of criminals walking the streets again, and this plan could be a way to make sure that doesn’t happen.’ Long sentences are imposed in several US states as an alternative to the death penalty. Under consideration: Senior Conservatives believe changing the sentencing regulations could overcome a ban on whole life terms being imposed by the European Court of Human Rights (pictured) Ariel Castro, who kidnapped three women in Ohio, was sentenced last year to 1,000 years in jail, although he later committed suicide. There are 49 criminals serving whole-life terms in the prison system of England and Wales. One of them is Mark Bridger, 47, who was sentenced in May last year for murdering Welsh schoolgirl April Jones. He lodged an appeal last month against his whole-life term. 'The European Court of Human Rights seems to be making decisions a million miles away from what the vast majority of the public think' Government source . Ian McLoughlin, 55, avoided such a sentence because of the ECHR ruling. He was told he must serve a minimum of 40 years after murdering Graham Buck, 66, in Hertfordshire in July, when he was on day release from a murder sentence. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Home Secretary Theresa May have both called for Britain to scrap the ECHR. However they are now considering options to detoxify the issue ahead of the next election by drawing up plans to allow judges to effectively over-rule it. The reforms have been drawn up by a committee led by Home Office minister Damian Green, under a new British Bill of Rights. Mr Green has said: ‘British laws must be made in Britain. I want to restore the respectability of human rights. ‘I think it is absurd and damaging that the phrase human rights has become a “boo” phrase . . . this is not a technical or legal issue – this is a really big moral issue.’","Understood to be option put forward in review of UK human rights laws .

"Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage are preparing to launch deeply personal attacks on one another tonight as the two men clash in their second TV debate. The gloves are expected to come off in the battle between the Lib Dem and Ukip leaders over the UK’s place in Europe and who can be trusted by the British people. Mr Clegg will be attacked for his background as a career politician and lobbyist  while Mr Farage is under pressure after admitting he ‘admires’ Russian President Vladimir Putin. The debate will be shown on BBC 2 tonight from 7pm. Clash: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip's Nigel Farage are expected to launch personal attacks in tonight;s debate . The two men go head-to-head on BBC2 from 7pm live from the BBC Radio Theatre . Immigration, regulations and EU expansion are expected to be among the subjects raised by the studio audience . Mr Clegg challenged Mr Farage to the debates ahead of elections to the European Parliament in May 22. In the first clash last week on LBC radio and Sky News, immigration dominated with the two men trading detailed facts and figures. A snap poll minutes after the debate showed 57 per cent thought Mr Farage had won, while only 36 per backed Mr Clegg. However, a ComRes survey for MailOnline yesterday found 38 per cent think Mr Farage poses a ‘danger to Britain’ and ‘a bit sleazy’ while Mr Clegg is viewed as out of his depth. Last week’s debate was dominated by rows over the use of statistics, with Mr Farage claiming 75 per cent of Britain’s laws come from Brussels and Mr Clegg insisting the figure was more like 7 per cent. However, just 18 per cent of people said Mr Clegg 'tells the truth’ while 25 per cent said the same of Mr Farage. Britain will eventually join the euro, former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Heseltine has claimed. The Conservative grandee who still advises David Cameron said the UK always resists European 'ventures' but ends up taking part. He also took a swipe at Ukip, claiming it has a 'racist undertone' which echoes Oswald Mosely in the 1920s. In an interview with the New Statesman magazine, Lord Hesletin was asked if the UK would join the euro. He replied: 'Oh yes, one day, one day. We have resisted all these European ventures in my life. We tried to keep out in Messina in 1955 [the conference that led to the creation of the European Economic Community]. 'That was a very bad decision. Then we joined on terms which were not to our liking but were the best we could get.' On Ukip he added: 'The racial overtones that are within the Ukip movement have got the same motivation [and] psychological impact as Mosley in the Twenties and Thirties, as Powell in the Sixties, Le Pen in France, the hard right in Holland and in Germany. It’s all the same stuff. 'There is a racist undertone, there’s no question about it.' Senior Lib Dems say they expected Mr Clegg to make a more ‘emotional’ pitch to voters. Leaving his home in South West London this morning, he told reporters: 'Nigel Farage is part of a group of people who have been pumping out misinformation for year after year after year. 'That’s not going to be reversed in one or even two hours of debate, but since no one else is prepared to actually tell the truth, spell it out like it is, that it makes no sense to be isolated in this world, that we’ve got to work with others to keep ourselves safe, to keep the economy strong, I’m going to continue to do that.; . He is expected to tackle Mr Farage again over his remarks about President Putin which have dominated the headlines since their first debate. ‘Compared with the kids who run foreign policy in this country I have got more respect for him than our lot,’ Mr Farage said this week. Asked in the GQ interview which current world leader he admired most, Mr Farage replied: ‘As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say Putin. The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant.’ However, Mr Clegg has condemned the comments as ‘extreme’ and ‘utterly grotesque’, accusing President Putin of being ‘the chief sponsor and protector of one of the most brutal dictators on the face of the planet, President Assad’ in Syria. At a press conference this week, the . Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘This isn't a game. This is thousands upon . thousands of people being killed and brutalised and murdered and chased . from their homes who we are now taking into our country. ‘Women . and children who have been sexually abused, who have been physically . abused, and we are thankfully acting in a generous-hearted way to . provide them refuge. ‘And he admires the man who has allowed, more than almost any other world leaders, that to happen? ‘I . just think if your hatred of all things to do with the European Union . leads to such a morally perverse conclusion - that you admire the one . leader in the world who could have reined in President Assad - it really . shows quite how extreme his views have become.’ In . an apparent admission that his comments on Putin have left him exposed, . Mr Farage today said he expected the issue to dominate tonight. He . told the BBC: 'They’re going to have a go at me over Putin because I’ve . been wildly misquoted over that. I was asked a couple of months ago . which world leader did I admire and I said Vladimir Putin as an . operator, particularly the way he managed to stop the West getting . militarily involved in Syria, but I don’t like him, I wouldn’t want to . live there and I don’t like him as a human being. But I’m sure there . will be a ding-dong over that.' A snap poll after last week's LBC debate suggested Mr Farage had triumphed over Mr Clegg . Ahead of tonight's debate, both parties have claimed surges in their membership. The Lib Dems say they have 44,000 members, up 500 this year but still down a third on the 65,000-plus levels it enjoyed before joining the Conservatives in coalition government in 2010. At the same time Ukip has seen its membership soar, from 20,000 at the end of 2012 to 35,000 at the weekend. Mr Farage has set his sights on overtaking the Lib Dems in terms of membership by the 2015 general elections. Ex-Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom . Nigel Farage is just a good 'salesman' who cannot lead Ukip properly, his former flatmate Godfrey Bloom has claimed. The . ex-Ukip MEP, who was forced to quit after upstaging his leader at the . party's conference last year, suggested Mr Farage had been in the job . for too long. 'Nigel has been doing it for twenty years, I think perhaps one might argue that's too long,' Mr Bloom told the Telegraph. He said Mr Farage is a 'charismatic' and 'articulate' salesman, but not a good 'managing director or chairman of the board'. He suggested there were 'bright young people' in the party, who were being blocked by Mr Farage. Mr . Bloom caused a storm when he complained about foreign aid money being . sent to 'Bongo Bongo Land', but was backed by Mr Farage. However . his comments calling a room of women 'sluts' on the day Mr Farage . delivered his keynote conference speech led to him resigning to sit as . an independent MEP.","Second TV debate between Lib Dem and Ukip leaders on BBC2 at 7pm .

"Across the world, people are crammed around their television sets, eagerly watching the $42million spectacular of London’s Opening Ceremonies. But those watching stateside will be forced to wait until 7:30pm EST, when NBC will broadcast the show, three and a half hours from the actual start of the ceremony, adjusted for time differences. The network, which has sole rights to broadcasting the Olympics in America, has chosen to delay their broadcast to the chagrin of viewers hoping to catch a live glance of the elaborate ceremonies. Click here to watch highlights from the opening ceremony . Delayed: The live broadcast of the Opening Ceremonies in London are being held by NBC, and will be broadcast instead at 7:30pm EST tonight; here, the performance has already started . Satire: Journalism professor and TV commenter Jeff Jarvis tweeted this topical thought . Further, they chose not to stream the events online, the Wall Street Journal said. An American in London: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, right, is at tonight's ceremony . This means that those wanting to watch on the West Coast must wait a full six and a half hours before seeing the commencement of the 2012 Olympic Games. Journalist and former TV critic Jeff Jarvis was among many who voiced their anger over the delay in the games. Mr Jarvis tweeted: 'Without NBC live streaming of the Olympics opening ceremonies, I'll have to rely on Mitt Romney's tweets.' Mr Romney has been doing damage control after questioning if Britain was capable of handling the Olympics. The presidential candidate has been on a high-profile tour of the country, and is attending the night's ceremonies. NBC, which has owned the American broadcasting rights to the Summer Olympic games since 1988, most likely held the broadcast so it would hit square in prime time. Advertisers pay more for time slots in such programming. According to Ad Week, NBC purchased the rights to the Olympics from 2014-2020 for a staggering $4.38billion. They were awarded the right by the International Olympic Committee. The site said that NBC lost $223million in its broadcast of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic games, and is slated to lose even more in the London broadcast. Isolation: This Twitter user (hyperbolicly) said he would turn off every form of social media ahead of tonight's delayed events . Tony Metcalf, the Editor-in-chief of New York City paper Metro called NBC’s actions a ‘clueless, arrogant disgrace.’ The jilted editor wrote in an editorial that he and his staffers had planned an office party, complete with drinks and pizza. When he realised that the pizza orders had to be cancelled, he wrote: ‘America's reputation at the Games has already taken a hit thanks to the brainless gibbering of Mitt Romney in the last few days.’ He continued: ‘And the notion that the NBC's audience figures are more important than the Olympic Games just supports stereotypes that Americans are insular, arrogant and could not care less of about anything that happens beyond the country's borders. I know they are not.’ Today show host Matt Lauer, along with . the rest of the popular morning show, have been broadcasting live from . the English capital and will continue their broadcast from London’s . Olympic Park for the duration of the two-week games. NBC affiliates like NBC Sports, NBC News, and CNBC will all broadcast events. NBC earlier told the New York Times’ Media Decoder that it has collected $1billion in Olympics advertising, including digital and cross-platform adverts. Included in that are apps for mobile and tablet devices, and a 3-D channel.  A full list of tomorrow's events may be seen here. How do you feel about the delay? Let us know in the comments section. Britain opened its Olympics with a royal entrance like no other. London greeted the world in a celebration of Old England that was stunning, imaginative, whimsical and dramatic - and cheeky - even featuring a stand-in for Queen Elizabeth II parachuting into Olympic Stadium. Moments later, the 86-year-old monarch herself stood solemnly while a children's choir serenaded her with 'God Save the Queen,' and members of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force raised the Union Jack. Fighter jets streaming red, white and blue smoke roared over the stadium, packed with a buzzing crowd of 60,000 people, at 8:12 p.m. - or 20:12 in the 24-hour time observed by Britons. Ringing in: The Olympic rings are illuminated with pyrotechnics as they are raised above the stadium . Foggy day: A storm cloud is suspended over the stadium, giving a cheeky nod to the country's notoriously grey summer . An explosion of fireworks against the London skyline and Paul McCartney leading a singalong were to wrap up the three-hour show masterminded by one of Britain's most successful filmmakers, Oscar winner Danny Boyle. He led off his spectacular in his favoured medium, with a high-speed flyover of the Thames, the river that slices like a vein through London and was the gateway for the city's rise over the centuries as a great global hub of trade and industry. The rush of images showed a cricket match, the London Tube and the roaring, abundant seas that buffet and protect this island nation - set to a pulsating soundtrack including snippets of the Sex Pistols' more irreverent cover of 'God Save the Queen.' To open the ceremony, children popped balloons with each number from 10 to 1, leading a countdown that climaxed with Bradley Wiggins, the newly crowned Tour de France champion. Wearing his race-winner's yellow jersey, Wiggins rang a 23-ton Olympic Bell from the same London foundry that made Big Ben and Philadelphia's Liberty Bell. Idyllic: Artists perform a scene in pastoral wear . Good health: Actors perform in a sequence meant to represent Britain's National Health Service (NHS) perform . Its thunderous chime echoed around the 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium. Bells in Britain have traditionally pealed to celebrate the end of war and the crowning of kings and queens, and now for the opening of a 17-day festival of sports. The show then shifted to a portrayal of Britain that Britons cling to - a place of meadows, farms, sport on village greens, picnics and Winnie-the-Pooh, A.A. Milne's fictional bear who has delighted generations of British children tucked warmly in bed. But the British ideal - to quote poet William Blake, of 'England's green and pleasant land' - then took a darker, grittier turn. The set was literally torn asunder, the hedgerows and farm fences carried away, as Boyle shifted to the industrial transformation that revolutionized Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, the foundation for an empire that reshaped world history. Belching chimneys rose where only moments earlier sheep had trod. Dickensian: Artists arrive on a horse and carriage, a nod to a bygone era of top hats and waistcoats . Variations on British themes: Danny Boyle drew inspiration for the show from British culture, including Alice in Wonderland, James Bond and Harry Potter, as well as Shakespeare . Country affair: Performers carry instruments during a segment of the ceremony . The Industrial Revolution also produced terrifying weapons, and Boyle built a moment of hush into his show to honour those killed in war. 'This is not specific to a country; this is across all countries, and the fallen from all countries are celebrated and remembered,' he explained to reporters ahead of the ceremony. 'Because, obviously, one of the penalties of this incredible force of change that happened in a hundred years was the industrialization of war, and the fallen,' he said. 'You know, millions fell.' Olympic organizers separately rejected calls for a moment of silence for 11 Israeli athletes and coaches slain by Palestinian gunmen at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Regal: Looking festive in a pale coral, Queen Elizabeth II, right, and Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee, right, appear at the festivities . Two of the Israelis' widows appealed to audience members to stand in silence when International Olympic Committee chief Jacques Rogge rises to speak later at Friday's ceremony. The Israeli culture and sport minister planned to do just that. Since then, 8,000 torchbearers, mostly unheralded Britons, have carried the flame on a 70-day, 8,000-mile journey from toe to tip of the British Isles, whipping up enthusiasm for a $14 billion Olympics taking place during a severe recession. The identity of the last torchbearer, the one to light the cauldron, was kept secret - remarkable given the intense scrutiny at what have been called the first social media Olympics. Speculation focused on Roger Bannister, the first man to run a four-minute mile, in 1954, and on rower Steve Redgrave, among others. Royal spectators: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoy the atmosphere ahead of the ceremony . Majestic: The Red Arrows fly over the Olympic Stadium at sunset, leaving plumes of red, white, and blue in the sky . Boyle's $42 million show, with 15,000 volunteers, promised to take the expected global television audience of 1 billion on a rich and textured journey through British history. In the center of the stadium, where athletes like Usain Bolt will star in the coming weeks, Boyle constructed a giant set portraying a romanticized vision of a green and pleasant Britain. Smoke wisped from the crooked chimneys of a homely thatched cottage. Meadows of perky pink flowers, spreads of real grass, fake fluffy clouds and live animals - including 40 cream-colored sheep - transported spectators from the East End of London to a rural idyll so dear to English hearts. That was later to give way to darker, grittier segments dwelling on the industrial might upon which Britain built a global empire and shaped world history. Not so happy: Spectators pass along a huge inflatable ball during the Opening Ceremony; many in the U.S. are upset they won't see the ceremony 'live' Full house: Thousands of spectators - an estimated 60,000 - take their seats ahead of the ceremony . Boyle's challenge was daunting: To be as memorable as Beijing's incredible, money-no-object opening ceremony of 2008. He drew from Shakespeare, British pop culture, literature and music, and other sources of inspiration that will speak to - but perhaps at times baffle - not just Anglophiles but people across the globe. One segment featured the actor Daniel Craig as James Bond, and former Beatle Paul McCartney was to lead a sing-along. For Jacques Rogge, it was his last time as president of the International Olympic Committee to watch the Olympic flag being raised at an opening ceremony. He will step down in 2013 after completing the maximum two terms. Besides the thousands of athletes and performers, 60,000 spectators were expected to pack Olympic Stadium. Political leaders from around the world, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and her daughters, and a sprinkling of European and celebrity royalty were also attending.","NBC network delaying broadcast of tonight's Opening Ceremonies until 7:30pm EST, three and a half hours after they began .

Runner Paula Radcliffe @paulajradcliffe wrote at 9pm: 'Nobody does it like Britain - nobody!' The world-wide audience was treated to a greatest hits medley of British pop over the decades with bursts of the Beatles, the Jam, Sex Pistols and Dizzee Rascal. There were also excerpts from the Kinks, Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Mud's Tiger Feet before Emile Sande sang the cup final classic Abide With Me. The Morecambe-born founder of Red or Dead, designer Wayne Hemingway, said: 'It just makes me so proud. Runner Paula Radcliffe gives her verdict on the Olympic Games opening ceremony . There was a lot of approval for the music playlist during the ceremony . The comedy sketch involving The Queen and Daniel Craig was another favourite part of the show . 'Watching it made me proud to be a Lancastrian. Danny Boyle is from just down the road to me and so much of my life was in this, everything I believe in, the history from the industrial revolution right through to the NHS.' Hemingway added: 'The musical bit was perfection from the wit and the guts to put Tiger Feet among the Beatles and the Who and then to give pretty much the whole of Pretty Vacant. 'Normally it would be brushed over, but the punk spirit which is in Britain was written through the ceremony. 'Anyone cynical about this has no lust for life, it's just bloody brilliant. 'I don't think anyone could find a fault. He deserves a knighthood.' Singer-songwriter Billy Bragg agreed, tweeting: 'Impressive though #openingceremony in Beijing was, they didn't have any great pop music to play, did they?' The comedy sketch with James Bond actor Daniel Craig and Britain's Queen Elizabeth was a big win with the audience. In the tongue-in-cheek film Craig wears his trademark tuxedo and enters Buckingham Palace. The 86-year-old monarch with two corgis at her feet and in her cinematic debut, turns from a writing desk and says simply: 'Good evening, Mr. Bond.

At 9.30pm, Gary Lineker ‏@GaryLineker tweeted: 'The Queen with James Bond was unquestionably a moment of utter genius. Take a bow Mr Boyle!' Mr Boyle, the mastermind behind the ceremony, received praise from all corners for the show with famous names tweeting their congratulations.

Moment of glory: Sir Chris Hoy acts as flag bearer leading the Great Britain team . A stunning array of fireworks descended as Team GB completed their tour around the stadium . Rocking show: After a show packed with classic tunes from across the decades, the Arctic Monkeys gave a live performance . Footballer Frank Lampard tweeted that Mr Boyle had created 'the best Olympic ceremony of all time'. Four-time Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy, the flagbearer for Team GB, also responded to good luck messages on the networking site, tweeting earlier: 'So many messages... Thank you for all the kind words. Tonight is going to be something special, hope you enjoy it!' But not all the feedback was positive with many complaining that the announcements were made in French first rather than English. Quint. S. Henschall, from Norwich, wrote on the Mail online: 'This is meant to be London Olympics, so whats with the French commentary, why, why, why!!' James M from Devon commented: 'Tired of hearing French first, ceremony should be presented English first, when a ceremony is being held in an English speaking Country, what an insult.' Another, Dan from the UK, wrote: 'I didn't realise Britain had been conquered by Napoleon, We speak English here my announcer.' But many other viewers pointed out that all Olympic Games have used French as the first language. Novelist and journalist Tony Parsons hit back at critics: 'Sneering at the Olympics is like sneering at Christmas. Do you want to be with Danny Boyle or Mitt Romney? Time to stop synchronised moaning.' 2pm: @DannyBoyleFilm: 'Wish me luck for tonight! #Olympics #Opening #Ceremony' 7pm: @Jeremy_Hunt: 'Tonight’s the night.

"It is the moment every model dreads - taking a tumble on the catwalk in front of the fashion pack and photographers. But at least they're in good company, with this model on a Lagos runway enduring her own Naomi Campbell moment yesterday with cameras there to catch the look of horror on her face. The model went head over heels as she walked in platform shoes and a knee-length printed dress for Nigerian fashion house Kinabuti in front of invited guests at the Italian consulate. Scroll down for video . This is the mid-air moment a model realised she was headed for a fall during the Kinabuti catwalk show in Lagos yesterday . The model put her hand out ready to break her fall as she took a tumble in front of the cameras during the catwalk show by the Nigerian fashion house . The accident, proving walking up and down a catwalk is far harder than some may think, will bring to mind Miss Campbell's own fall as she modelled for Vivienne Westwood in vertiginous heels at Paris Fashion Week in 1993. The mock-crocodile Super Elevated Gillie shoes proved to be her undoing with five-inch platforms and nine-inch heels seeing her hit the deck - later becoming part of fashion history and finding a new home in the Victoria and Albert Museum collection. The model endured her own Naomi moment - bringing to mind Miss Campbell's fall on a Paris catwalk in 1993 . Thankfully the rest of the Carnival in the Desert show went . without a hitch for Kinabuti, a Lagos-based ethical fashion label run by . Italian designer Caterina Bortolussi. If anything, the label will be pleased that the model mishap has showcased its 2013 collection designs across the world - you can't buy that kind of publicity.

"Insensitive: NBC's Bob Costas noted a controversy over honoring Israeli athletes killed at the Olympics 40 years ago during his coverage of the opening ceremony a the London Olympics, but stopped short of offering his own protest . NBC's Bob Costas noted a controversy over honouring Israeli athletes killed at the Olympics 40 years ago during his coverage of the opening ceremony but stopped short of offering his own protest. The International Olympic Committee had declined a request to hold a moment of silence during the ceremony to acknowledge the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian gunmen in Munich in 1972. Costas called that decision insensitive during an interview this month and indicated he would call for his own moment of silence when Israeli athletes marched into the Olympic Stadium on Friday. Costas' comments took his bosses by surprise. Jim Bell, executive producer of the NBC's telecast, said this week that Costas hadn't brought it up with him before the interview. As the athletes marched in Friday, Costas said that IOC President Jacques Rogge led a moment of silence for the late Israelis this week before about 100 people at the Athlete's Village. 'Still, for many, tonight with the world watching is the true time and place to remember those who were lost and how and why they died,' Costas said. After a five-second pause, NBC cut to a commercial. The network has been under fire by many who were upset the U.S. network, which has exclusive rights to broadcasting in America. Cut from NBC: Scottish singer Emeli Sande performs a moving rendition of Abide With Me in memory of the victims of the 7/7 London bombings at the Olympics Opening Ceremony . NBC said in a statement: 'We are live streaming every sporting event, all 32 sports and all 302 medals… The opening and closing ceremonies, however, are entertainment spectacles. 'Our award-winning production team will present them on a medium that best demonstrates their grandeur and majesty, and at a time when friends and family are able to gather together to watch, which is in prime time.' Britons are also fuming that tributes to victims of the 7/7 attacks were combined in a general memorial, and not given their own moment of silence. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, which promotes Jewish causes, said he appreciated Costas bringing up the issue, though he didn't expect a moment of silence. Moving montage: The faces of spectators' loved ones who have passed away, including the victims of 7/7, were flashed up on big screens around the Olympic Stadium and on TV . In their memory: Those shown on the big screens included the late fathers of Danny Boyle, the opening ceremony's director, and London 2012 chief Lord Coe . 'He established a sense of history and decency and sensitivity, I would say, in the tradition of Jim McKay,' Foxman said. The late McKay is the former ABC sports caster who anchored coverage of the 1972 attack. But the song was edited out of NBC's coverage in favour of a bland Ryan Seacrest interview with Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, it was reported on Deadspin.com. Twitter very quickly became awash with comments demanding to know why the broadcaster had chosen that moment to break away from proceedings. Scott Carruthers said: 'NBC cut tribute to the 7/7 victims from #olympicceremony coverage, shocking considering we honour the 9/11 victims at every opportunity.' Dave Hogg tweeted: 'NBC skilled a tribute to servicemen and the 7/7 victims to show Seacrest interviewing Phelps. That's horrendous'. Furious: Viewers took to Twitter to voice their disgust at NBC's decision to cut the tribute from its coverage . Angry: Many viewers were demanding to know why NBC chose to cut an entire performance, particularly such an emotive one . Meanwhile, Tamsin Wood said: 'So NBC . cut out our tribute to the 7/7 victims for a stupid interview!! Rude and . disrespectful on so many levels!! #openingceremony.' NBC . is known for cutting away for small portions of the opening ceremonies . to make way for commercial, but U.S. commentators say they have never . heard of it skipping a whole performance before. The . memorial was a moving section on a night full of pomp, humour and high . drama that got the Greatest Show On Earth up and running in truly . British style. The BBC . introduced the segment by saying: 'Ladies and gentlemen, please pause . silent for our memorial wall for friends and family who can't be here . tonight. 'The excitement of that moment in Singapore seven years ago when England won the games was tempered the next day with sorrow from the events of July 7 that year. A wall of remembrance for those no longer here to share in this event.' 'Horrendous decision': The tribute was replaced with an interview by Ryan Seacrest (left) with U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps (right) The big screens then showed a montage of images of spectators' loved ones who have passed away, including the late fathers of Danny Boyle, the show's director and London 2012 chief Lord Coe. Dancers dressed in red, representing the struggle between life and death, were picked out by a spotlight in the darkness of the stadium as the powerful vocals of Sande pierced the air with Abide With Me. This was followed by the procession of the 204 countries taking part and the lighting of the cauldron to signal the start of the Games.","NBC Sports broadcaster Bob Costas called decision to not include tribute to victims of the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes insensitive .

"A PR executive working for the makers of Xbox game Call Of Duty siphoned off £18,963 to pay for her engagement party, hen party and designer shopping sprees. Kathryn Kirton, 35, was head of PR at Activision when she got carried away with the 'glamorous and luxurious' world of public relations, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. She was in charge of the budget for a major film premiere-style launch of the game, but instead siphoned off thousands of pounds. She spent £9,437 at designer clothes store Reiss on one of three shopping trips along with another £2,000 on a luxury hotel break for her then fiance Lee Kirton. Kathryn Kirton, pictured at Blackfriars Court today, was head of PR at Activision when she allegedly siphoned the money from the company she worked for after being 'seduced' by the glamour of the world she worked in . Co-defendant Jamie Kaye, also pictured today, made purchases on his company credit card and even paid for a . family holiday in Florida . Along with Kirton, PR consultant Jamie Kaye, was ‘corrupted by the world he worked in,’ helped her make the dodgy purchases using his company credit card as well as helping himself to a £3,500 family holiday to Florida. Blackfriars Crown Court heard that Kirton, of Wandsworth, south London, had been in charge of the budget for the major ‘film premiere’ style launch of Call Of Duty: Black Ops but got carried away by the 'glamorous and luxurious' world of public relations. Kirton admitted stealing a total of £18,963 from company Activision while co-defendant Kaye admitted taking a total of £5,000. But in sentencing today, Judge John Hillen spared them both jail and said the case reflected the temptations on offer in the world of PR. He said: ‘You were in a position of considerable responsibility. ‘You bought a large quantity of designer clothing. You spent time in luxury accommodation and you funded your engagement party through dishonest means. ‘There was repeat dishonesty over a period of months. There is no doubt your wickedness deserves a severe sentence.’ ‘In the world of PR you are surrounded by luxury items. That is reality for people working in that industry. Charged to the company credit card: Kirton took her then finance Lee Kirton for a £2,000 two-night stay to luxury hotel Babington House (pictured) with palatial grounds in the Somerset countryside . ‘What is surprising is that cases . like this are happening more and more often in your industry. But this . is not the place to explore the PR industry.’ The . court heard how Kirton paid for a group of friends to stay overnight . for her 'hen-do' at the exclusive Townhouse Hotel in central London - . part of the Soho House group of venues popular with celebrities - where . she racked up a bill of more than £1,000 and charged it back to her . company. In September 2010 . she took her then finance Mr Kirton on a romantic £2,000 two-night stay . to luxury hotel Babington House with palatial grounds in the Somerset . countryside. Kirton threw a £1,500 engagement party at exclusive central London venue Cafe de Paris (pictured), to which she invited her boss, before invoicing the firm for it .

She also splurged thousands of pounds on clothes on three shopping . sprees at Reiss. Sarah Elliott, defending, said Kirton . got ‘carried away’ by the lifestyle and had ‘moments of madness’ which . she is now paying the price for. The court heard how Kirton made the . fraudulent payments by getting Kaye, a consultant at Frank PR who she . was employing to help with the video game launch, to pay for the dodgy . purchases on his company credit card. The ‘highly respected’ PR boss . then authorised invoices that allowed Kaye to charge the money back to . Activision. Kevin Dent, . prosecuting, told the court: 'There were occasions when Mrs Kirton . stayed in expensive accommodation at the expense of her employers. 'On . one occasion the defendant went to the Reiss store where Mrs Kirton . bought a large quantity of designer items for herself and her then . finance Lee Kirton. On another occasion £5,506 worth of clothing was . bought using the credit card of Frank PR. When it was billed back it was . described as being clothing for a specialist magazine shoot, something . connected with the Modern Warfare 2 launch. 'Motivated by your own greed': Kirton spent £9,437 in one of three shopping sprees at designer clothes store Reiss before it was billed to Activision by co-defendant Jamie Kaye . Kirton's marriage broke down after the criminal investigation began - and she also had her baby two months prematurely. She has been sentenced to 18 months in prison . 'The clothes purchased have been looked at and they were nothing to do with Modern Warfare or any such game.' Kirton also spent £9,437 on clothes on a third Reiss shopping spree in October 2010. Mr Dent said: 'It seems that Mrs Kirton arrived by car and in effect loaded up her car with clothes that had been purchased.' Judge Hillen told Kirton that she had . abused her ‘considerable responsibility’ to siphon off the cash but he . accepted that since the fraud her circumstances have changed . considerably. Kirton's . marriage has broken down and she had given birth to her two-year-old son . prematurely because of the strain of the investigation. Judge Hillen . spared her jail because of the ‘devastating effect’ it would have on her . young son. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for two . years. He said: 'I would have . insisted that began with immediate effect if it wasn't for the . devastating effect it would have on your child. Kaye, 36, from Enfield, stole six . iPads from his firm for himself and his family and ‘decided to take a . family holiday to Florida and sought to charge that holiday to Frank PR . as a legitimate travel expense’, charging his company nearly £3,500 the . court heard. Their scam was . uncovered when Kirton's company became alarmed at the suspicious . payments and investigators discovered the fraud in February 2011. Judge Hillen said: ‘What you did, each of you, was to overstep the boundaries of what was permissible and what was not. ‘That overstepping of the boundary was motivated by your own greed. ‘What you did eats at the heart of commerce but that did not deter you or others.’ In . sentencing Kaye, Judge Hillen said: ‘Mr Kaye you have been corrupted by . the world you worked in and were willingly drawn in by your . co-defendant. ‘This places your marriage in jeopardy, as well as your character and future employment prospects.’ Kaye was given a nine month sentence, suspended for 12 months. He was also ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work. Both pleaded guilty to one count of fraud.","Kathryn Kirton admitted stealing £18,963 from company Activision .

"A teenage girl separated from her friends on a night out was put in a taxi and driven to a muddy park 25 miles away, where she was raped twice and thought she was going to die, a court heard today. Arshad Arif, 28, of Slough, Berkshire, allegedly approached the 17-year-old when she was standing cold and wet outside a nightclub in Watford, Hertfordshire, with no money, mobile phone or coat. Two hours later she banged on a couple’s door in Slough, with her tights hanging off and underwear missing - after being attacked twice by Arif, who had forced her to perform acts, the court was told. Trial: Arshad Arif, 28, of Slough, Berkshire, allegedly approached the 17-year-old when she was standing cold and wet outside a nightclub in Watford, Hertfordshire, with no money, mobile phone or coat . Abigail Husbands, prosecuting, told Reading Crown Court in Berkshire: ‘Her father received a terrible phone call from his daughter - the sort every parent dreads. She had been attacked.’ After meeting friends at one of their parents’ houses, the group had gone a bar in Watford, before ending up at the nightclub Oceana where they drank more wine and shots of spirits. But she became separated from her friends, who last saw the girl at 1.50am and could not find her. ‘She had no coat, no bag, no money and no phone,’ Ms Husbands added. ‘It was raining. It was late November. She must have been feeling pretty desperate.’ After being outside on her own for about an hour, during which she tried in vain to contact people by borrowing other people’s phones, the girl - who was then 17 - was allegedly approached by Arif. The jury watched footage showing them . speaking briefly before he led her away. They walked away from a taxi . rank outside the club and she then used Arif's phone to make a call, the court was told. The prosecutor said: ‘Her parents were . woken up by a call to their landline. She said: “Mum, it’s me. I don’t . feel very well. I can’t find the others. I want to come home. Can you . come and get me?” Her mother got out of bed and set off to collect her last November from Watford, but arrived too late. Trial: Reading Crown Court (pictured) was told Arif was identified after it emerged he had earlier allowed the schoolgirl to use his phone to call her parents last November - with her father noting down the number . As the mother set off, her daughter was getting into the taxi with the man she had only just met. He spoke to the driver in a language she did not understand, the court was told. ‘When they got to a drop-off point that . was in Slough - where the man wanted to go - the female said she didn’t . want to get out but the male took her with him,’ Ms Husbands said. The girl told police that once out of the . taxi the man took her into a park and after walking for several minutes . they stopped at a muddy area, before he exposed himself and raped her. 'She had no coat, no bag, no money and no phone. It was raining. It was late November. She must have been feeling pretty desperate' Abigail Husbands, prosecuting . The victim said that during the alleged attack she feared she was going to die. In a police interview played to jurors she said how Arif threatened her and forced her to perform acts. Following the attack, she managed to reach a house, where she roused the elderly couple who lived there, the court heard. They comforted her and let her use their phone to call her father. Arif was allegedly identified after it . emerged he had earlier allowed the schoolgirl to use his phone - with her father noting . down the number - and a swab taken from the girl allegedly had his semen. The girl's memory failed her from between 12.30am and 3am - from shortly after drinks were bought for the friends by an Asian man in Oceana and around the time she got the taxi, the court heard. Arif denies two counts of rape. The trial, before Judge Zoe Smith, continues.

"It is just as well Stoke substitute Peter Crouch salvaged a stoppage-time point with a header to rival Harry Kane’s super nod, for Mark Hughes’ bank balance could have taken a hit had defeat been allowed to amplify his rage. The Potters boss was furious – with some justification - that referee Kevin Friend failed to dismiss Jack Colback moments before he fired what looked to be the winning goal. The Newcastle midfielder was already in the book for a foul on Marc Muniesa when, needlessly charging to close down Victor Moses deep in the visiting half, he floored the winger. Friend, though, chose not to show a second yellow. It was a baffling decision and left Hughes incensed. Crouch’s equaliser, however, meant his post-match reflection was perhaps more considered, although his comments may yet be of interest to the FA.

Jack Colback fires Newcastle United ahead - CLICK HERE to see out brilliant Match Zone . ‘The disappointment is that the referee wasn’t brave enough to make the right decision at a key moment in the game,’ he said. ‘Given the yellow cards which were dished out and the nature of them, for him not to give Colback a clear second yellow was disappointing. He needs to be stronger. The lad is allowed to stay on the pitch and scored the goal which nearly means we didn’t take something from the game. With them down to 10 men I think we would have won. ‘But there is no point (in speaking to the referee), the game has gone. I don’t think I’ll get an apology either, in all my years of management I’ve never had one, so I don’t expect it now.’ Colback, meanwhile, would have had no complaints had he been banished to the dressing-room. ‘If I'd seen a second yellow, I couldn't have felt too aggrieved,’ he said. ‘I caught him but you ride your luck sometimes.’ Mike Williamson (centre) of Newcastle tries to challenge Stoke's Jonathan Walters (left) as the latter shoots on goal .

Stoke boss Mark Hughes (left) makes his feelings known while standing on the touchline at St James' Park . Hughes’ irritation was only soothed by the sight of Crouch towering to cushion Geoff Cameron’s deep hoist beyond the despairing glove of Tim Krul and underneath the crossbar. And, after the eulogies which followed Kane’s effort to win Saturday’s North London derby, Hughes was keen to extol the aerial virtues of his veteran frontman. ‘If you listen to what has been said over the weekend then Harry Kane is only guy who scores goals like that, but that’s an oversight on Peter Crouch - he’s been doing that for a long time,’ he said. ‘Peter has been unlucky in the last few weeks not to start more games. But he’s very much valued at this club, that’s why we gave him a new contract. Coming on or starting, he will always have an impact – that’s a credit to him as a professional.’ Diouf (centre) of Stoke is challenged by Newcastle's Colback (right) as Ameobi (left) looks on during the first half .

Ameobi (left) stretches his foot highest as the Newcastle winger beats Stoke's Stephen Ireland to the ball at St James' Park . As impressive as Crouch’s finish was, that Newcastle had committed so many bodies forward at that late juncture was unforgivable. Head coach John Carver agreed, as he fumed: ‘There were two minutes left on the clock and we get a free-kick. It goes into the final third and we play four or five passes backwards and back to the keeper who kicks it. We were out of shape and before you know it’s in the back of the net. That’s unprofessional. With two minutes left you should run ball in corner.’ But Newcastle should have made sure of the points before that concession. Colback gave them a largely undeserved lead when he steered home low from 12 yards on 74 minutes and substitute Gabriel Obertan was sprung clear soon after. He, however, dithered in the area and the chance was gone. Ayoze Perez was equally wasteful when blazing over moments before Crouch’s leveller. Carver bemoaned those misses but praised Colback, who, in his opinion, should not have been sent off.

Muniesa (centre, bottom) receives treatment from the Stoke medical team after suffering an injury against Newcastle . ‘Jack is a very competitive footballer and we won’t take that out of him. I thought the ref handled the game very well and, for me, it definitely was not a second yellow,’ he said. ‘I’ve told Jack he has to start scoring more and he showed good energy to get in box and get a good goal. ‘But it hadn’t been a classic game and won’t be going in my DVD collection. They can’t be exciting all of the time though. Sometimes you have to do what you can to win a game. Win 1-0, go home and everyone is happy. It is frustrating that we did not do that. We even had a couple of great opportunities after Jack’s goal.’ Earlier, Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic produced an instinctive stop to keep out Remy Cabella’s header and Krul pulled off an identical save at the other end to thwart Mame Biram Diouf. But Carver was right, it had been a dour affair before the relative excitement of the final 15 minutes. In fact, Friend’s failure to send off Colback had given the contest a much-needed injection of incident and injustice – not that Hughes would agree with that assessment.

"James Milner conceded Manchester City might have suffered a telling blow in the title race despite his late rescue act against Hull. England midfielder Milner struck a superb injury-time free-kick to snatch a 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium after a troubled afternoon against the relegation battlers. James Milner scores the equaliser from a free kick but it is not enough for Manchester City . The result left the champions seven points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea and needing inspiration to get the defence of their crown back on track. Milner said: ""We can't really afford too many more slip-ups, if any. Chelsea have a big lead now but it's down to us to see how many points we can get. ""We know, more than anyone, you have to keep going to the death and anything can happen, but I think we have got to be pretty faultless between now and the end of the season to get close."" Manchester City's Vincent Kompany looks dejected as Hull pull off a shock at the Etihad Stadium . City have already recovered from a bigger deficit this season, having trailed Chelsea by eight points in November. A good run of form in December saw them pull level with the Londoners before the end of 2014, and they could even have gone ahead had they not been pegged back to a 2-2 draw by Burnley. But problems have again resurfaced in the new year and they are now without a win in five matches in all competitions, a streak that included a shock loss to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup. Manager Manuel Pellegrini accepted his team were lacking in ideas and Milner is at a loss to explain this season's home form. City have won just seven of their 12 league games at Eastlands this term. Manager Manuel Pellegrini accepted his team were lacking in ideas during their game against Hull . He said: ""You can look at a few things but over the 90 minutes I don't think we troubled them as much as we should have done. ""For whatever reason we've struggled at home this year and dropped far too many points. ""It's a flip from last year when our away form was poor. It's disappointing but we need to regroup and come back and try and put a run of results together."" City were unusually subdued throughout the first half and had a scare when Ahmed Elmohamady thumped a header against the crossbar. Joe Hart pulls out all the stops to deny Hull a goal at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday aftermoon . Hull, going into the game in the bottom three and on the back of three successive losses, showed no lack of confidence and looked the better side. Their reward came in the 35th minute when David Meyler turned home a rebound after Gaston Ramirez had struck the post with a shot fired amid some chaotic scenes in the City defence. City did increase the pressure in the second half and had a strong penalty appeal turned down when Alex Bruce appeared to knock David Silva over. Hull City's David Meyler celebrates after scoring the opening goal in the 1-1 draw with Manchester City . Sergio Aguero looks dejected after missing a great chance as Manchester City yet again dropped points . It seemed Hull might hold on when Sergio Aguero hit the bar in the 90th minute but there was still time for Milner, a 66th-minute substitute, to have the final say by bending a fine free-kick around the wall. For Hull, it was hard to take after such a battling display but it was still a good point and they now go into Tuesday's home clash against Aston Villa with renewed spirits. Manager Steve Bruce said: ""We've now got a huge game on Tuesday and we need to produce a performance we can relish, like we did here. Let's hope we can keep it up. ""We have to turn our home form around, for certain, but it bodes well when you can go to Liverpool, Arsenal and Man City and get draws.""

"It is the final that Africa has been anticipating for a decade. On one side stand the last remnants of the ‘golden generation’, the most talented squad the continent has ever produced. On the other are a group of players that won the 2009 U-20 World Cup, were just a Luis Suarez hand-ball from being the most successful African nation at a World Cup, and should now be in their prime. And yet, it is a final that, before the tournament, next to no-one would have predicted. They may both have been perennial favourites for the past ten years, but coming into this Cup of Nations, both teams were in disarray. Ghana's captain Andre Ayew controls a ball during a training session in Bata . Ivory Coasts players take part in a training session on the eve of the African Cup of Nations . The Ivorians, for all their big names, had conceded 11 times in six qualifying games. Without the talismanic Didier Drogba for the first major tournament since 2002, there was a real feeling that their best chance of ending a trophy drought that now spans more than two decades had gone. Even less was expected of Ghana. Despite the undoubted talent in their squad, qualifying was a shambles. The Black Stars took just one point from two games against Uganda, and needed a late goal to edge past Togo. They only appointed manager Avram Grant a matter of weeks before the tournament, and the decision was greeted with derision by many in African football. vory Coasts players warm up during a training session at the Bikuy Stadium in Bata . Ghana's coach Avram Grant leads his team's training session on the eve of the African Cup of Nations . Grant has never before managed on the continent, and was seen as merely a big name, brought in with little hope of securing a first major title in 33 years. But both sides have defied expectation, and, after a slow start, developed into resilient teams. Of the two, Ghana have been the more exciting. Christian Atsu, the Chelsea winger struggling to get games on loan at Everton, has, in flashes at least, been brilliant. His goal against Guinea could well be the best of the tournament, whether he meant it or not. Alongside him are surprise package Kwesi Appiah, nominally a Crystal Palace player but on loan at Cambridge United in League Two, and the tournament’s top scorer Andre Ayew. Grant and Ayew talk football ahead of a press conference in Bata . Appiah’s rise in particular has been remarkable. A shock selection even to be picked in the squad, the League Two striker only made his Ghana debut in the tournament’s third game off the bench. But after being handed a start in the knock-out stages the goals have started to come, and in the semi-final he was man of the match, winning a penalty and creating the third goal. The fourth man in that attack on Sunday night, will, injury permitting, be Asamoah Gyan, a man who sums up this Ghana side. Ivory Coast's soccer players attend a training session at Bikuy stadium on the outskirts of Bata . Despite all his ability, he will always be remembered for a missed penalty against Uruguay in 2010. Now, far from his best, he is on the brink of finally realizing the dream of winning a major tournament. Having endured a bout of malaria that kept him out of the tournament opener, and missing the semi-final after being kicked in the stomach by Naby Yattara, it would be just like Gyan to pop up with a winner on the biggest stage. The Toure brothers take part in passing and training drills as they prepare for the final . Ghana's Asamoah Gyan smiles during a training session in Bata . Gyan’s Ivorian equivalent is, undoubtedly, Yaya Toure. The Manchester City man is not the same player for his country as we see at club level and yet, despite a poor tournament personally, he could still lead his side to glory. Playing as a holding midfielder Toure’s ability to influence games has been greatly diminished, but he still popped up with a thunderous strike to put his side ahead in the semi-final. With team-mate Wilfried Bony ahead of him, and brother Kolo behind, the spine of the Ivorian side is as good as almost any international side in the world. Yet Herve Renard has eschewed the attacking approach of previous managers, and has the team playing pragmatic football, utilizing the pace of Gervinho and Max Gradel on the break, while sitting deep and taking the sting out of the opposition. Ivory Coast's head coach Herve Renard of France reacts during a news conference in Bata . Gyan warms up during a training session ahead of the AFCON 2015 final between Ivory Coast and Ghana . It is a tactic that has worked thus far. Kolo Toure has been masterful in marshaling a three-man defence with two rookies, Wilfried Kanon and Eric Bailly. The attacking thrust has come from Paris St Germains’ wing-back Serge Aurier, and despite neither Yaya or Bony being near their best, as a collective the Ivorians look at their strongest for a decade. It is all set up for a spectacular showdown. While off-field scenes have dominated the headlines following violence in Ghana’s semi-final against hosts Equatorial Guinea, Sunday night’s game has the potential to be a classic. It may not be enough to distract the world from the shameful scenes of Thursday night, but, at least, this may be the final that an otherwise excellent tournament deserves.

"Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has been given a timely boost ahead of his side's Premier League clash at Arsenal on Saturday, as Angel di Maria, David de Gea, Michael Carrick and Luke Shaw all took part in Friday's training session. The quartet had all been fitness doubts for the match at the Emirates after picking up injuries playing for their respective countries during the recent international break. United's club-record £60million signing Di Maria injured his right foot during Argentina's 1-0 friendly defeat to Portugal on Tuesday, while fellow summer acquisition Shaw came off 66 minutes into England's win in Scotland as a precaution after feeling his left hamstring tighten. Angel di Maria (left) took part in Manchester United training on Friday after recovering from a foot injury . David de Gea (left) and Luke Shaw both also took part in Friday's session after picking up injuries during the international break . Michael Carrick (left) was pictured all smiles as he looks to regain full fitness after hurting his groin . The news of the quartet's return to fitness will be a boost to boss Louis van Gaal (right) ahead of their clash against Arsenal . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney (centre) will be hoping to lead the Red Devils to victory on Saturday . Midfielder Carrick had to withdraw from the Three Lions' set-up after hurting his groin, while Spain international De Gea dislocated a finger - but the pair seemed in good spirits at the club's Aon Complex on Friday. The duo's jovial mood was reciprocated among Van Gaal's squad with many of the Dutchman's charges seen enjoying themselves as they were put through their paces. United's position in the table though is no laughing matter with the club seventh in the Premier League and 13 points adrift of table toppers Chelsea after 11 games of the season. Robin van Persie, who is expected to face a hostile reception when he returns to his former club at the weekend, will be hoping to replicate his international form with Holland after  scoring during the international break. Old Trafford skipper Wayne Rooney needs one more goal against the Gunners to become the highest Premier League goalscorer against Arsene Wenger's side. Rooney is currently tied with Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler on 10 league goals against the Gunners with two for Everton and eight for United. Rooney (left) needs one more goal against Arsenal to become the highest Premier League goalscorer against Arsene Wenger's side . Van Gaal (left) will be hoping Robin van Persie can haunt his former club on his return to the Emirates . Speaking ahead of Saturday's clash against Arsenal, Rooney believes former team-mate Danny Welbeck did the right thing by swapping Old Trafford for the Emirates in a £16million move this summer. Many United fans were shocked earlier this year when Van Gaal sanctioned Welbeck's £16million transfer to the north London club. Welbeck is a life-long United fan and joined the club as an eight-year-old having grown up in the Longsight area of Manchester, which is just four miles away from Old Trafford. During his 11-year spell at United, Rooney watched the pacy forward progress from teenage prodigy to first-team striker and admits it will be strange to play against the 23-year-old striker when the two sides meet on Saturday. 'Of course, Danny has been here all of his life,' Rooney told MUTV. 'He is a Manchester lad so it is weird seeing him [there]. But that's football nowadays and players move on.' Welbeck started the vast majority of games on United's successful tour of the United States, however he struggled to get in the starting line-up soon after the season began, with Van Gaal claiming his goal-scoring record was not good enough. Van Gaal (right) and assistant manager Ryan Giggs share a joke as they watch the session unfold at the Aon Training Complex . Belgium international duo Adnan Januzaj (centre) and Marouane Fellaini will both be hoping to start against Arsenal on Saturday . Welbeck scored 29 times in 142 United appearances, but since his move he has found the net on 10 occasions for club and country. Rooney, who played alongside Welbeck for England against Slovenia and Scotland in the recent international break, thinks leaving United has been beneficial for his former team-mate. 'I think, for Danny, and for his own personal career, it was probably the best move for him,' Rooney said. 'He's done great and scored a few goals and is playing well. Danny gives you what he always gives you - a good shift. He works hard for the team. 'At times, as I said to him, he works a bit too hard but he's scoring goals and he's doing well.' Arsenal against United has been one of the biggest fixtures on the calendar in recent years, but neither side is considered a serious title contender this season. Midfield duo Juan Mata (bottom left) and Antonio Valencia (bottom right) are put through their paces on Friday . Anders Lindegaard (left) could make his first Premier League appearance of the season if De Gea fails to recover from his injury . For Rooney, the fixture still brings back fond memories, though. 'We've had some great memories,' the England captain added. Beating them in the Champions League semi-final (in 2009) was probably the highlight.' The same fixture last year ended in a dull 0-0 draw, but given the poor defensive record of both teams, it is unlikely the scoreline will be the same this season. Rooney is hoping United can strike early against their opponents and is expecting a tough match. 'It's always a tight game and whoever gets the first goal normally wins or gets a result,' the 29-year-old said. 'We have to go there with a good team shape and a good unit to make sure we do everything right. 'Arsenal have got a good squad, an exciting squad with a lot of young players and a lot of English players which is great for England. We know they play with a lot of energy and we'll have to be at our best to beat them.' Click here to Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Jailed: Pakistan-born Atiq Rehman, who was twice refused leave to remain in the UK, was jailed for six years . An illegal immigrant who was twice refused asylum in Britain raped a woman before he could be deported, a court heard yesterday. Atiq Rehman, 20, spotted his 22-year-old victim leaving a club and tricked her into thinking he was a taxi driver. He then lured her into the back room of a corner shop and attacked her on a mattress for 45 minutes. Yesterday the Pakistani national was jailed for six years after he pleaded guilty to two counts of rape. Sentencing him, Judge Usha Karu said: ‘The fear she must have experienced simply can’t be imagined.’ Rehman had applied for asylum in the UK twice last year. His initial asylum application and subsequent appeal were rejected by the Home Office. After his rejection, he dropped under the radar of the authorities and may have used a fake name to avoid detection. In the hours before the attack, his victim had spent the evening with friends at Infernos nightclub in Clapham, south London. Within minutes of luring her into the shop, Rehman raped her. He threatened to tie her up with duct tape if she did not stop crying. He then raped her again before callously asking her how many children she wanted to have. After the attack on April 29 he threw her out of the shop. The young woman stumbled to a friend’s house in nearby Balham and called the police. Describing the attack, prosecutor Jeffrey Israel told Inner London Crown Court the victim met Rehman after becoming separated from her friends outside the club. ‘He approached her and she mistakenly thought he was offering a taxi service,’ Mr Israel said. ‘Mr Rehman had keys to open the metal shutters to the shop, and led her through to the back room. Attack: Rehman led the woman to Newspoint store in Clapham . Common Southside, (pictured) after she became separated from her friends outside . the club following a night socialising . There were two mattresses on the . floor, and the woman began to cry. She was scared because she didn’t . want to be in that room alone with the defendant.’ During the attack the woman was ‘shouting and crying’ and ‘physically trying to push him away from her’, he said. ‘Throughout, she was shouting at him . to stop and trying to escape from him,’ Mr Israel said. ‘She told him . she didn’t want to do this, and was begging him to stop. Rather than . stopping, he pushed her on to her back and pulled her arms. She was . struggling to get away.’ Club: Rehman had led the girl from outside Inferno’s nightclub in Clapham, south London, (inside pictured) with the promise of a taxi ride home before threatening to tie her up with tape while he carried out the attack . The owner of the shop, Bilal Akbar, . was initially arrested on suspicion of rape, but told detectives he had . lent his keys to Rehman, who had fled to Manchester. Rehman handed himself in to police on May 26, but initially claimed a friend was responsible and he had been wrongly accused. Later he changed his story and claimed . he had consensual sex with the victim. Eventually he pleaded guilty to . two counts of rape. However, even in court yesterday he continued to . maintain the sex had been consensual. Rehman, of Thornton Heath, . Surrey, was jailed for six years on both counts of rape, to run concurrently, and . he was ordered to be deported on his release from prison . Judge Karu said his crimes had been . compounded by an ‘element of abduction’, the length of the ordeal, and . the fact he took advantage of a woman who had been drinking. The judge ordered Rehman, of Thornton . Heath, South London, to be deported on his release from prison. Outside . court, investigating officer Detective Constable Lisa Greedy, said: . ‘This was an horrific attack by a man who had no qualms in exploiting a . woman who he believed to be intoxicated. ‘The fact that he then threatened his victim with violence only added to her trauma. ‘I would like to pay tribute to the victim who showed strength and determination throughout the investigation.’","Atiq Rehman lured a .

"Rangers have problems that run much deeper than a Scottish Cup defeat to a team from the same division. But there was something about Sunday's loss to Raith Rovers — exactly the kind of side you don’t want encounter in the middle of a crisis — that felt particularly damning. And historic. This was Raith’s first win against Rangers at Ibrox since 1959, when a lad by the name of Jim Baxter scored in their 3-2 triumph. If none of the current Rovers squad appears destined to achieve the same kind of mythical status as Baxer, the same — and more — could be said of the hopeless bunch now representing the ‘other’ club he went on to serve with such elegant ease. Christian Nade (left) was on hand to slam home the loose ball and send Raith Rovers into the quarter-finals . Nade peels away to celebrate scoring the winner against Rangers in the Scottish Cup Fifth Round tie . Rangers (4-4-1-1): Simonsen 5; Foster 5, Streete 5 (McGregor, 43), McCulloch 4, Wallace 5; Law 5, Hutton 5, Black 4 (Murdoch, 74); Miller 6; Daly 6 (Boyd, 64) Subs not used: Robinson, Aird, Shiels. Booked: McCulloch, Foster . Goal: Vuckic 62 . Raith (4-4-1-1): McGurn 6; Thomson 7, Watson 7, Hill 7, McKeown 6; Anderson 8, Callachan 6, Moon 7, Conroy 7; Carrick 6 (Stewart 50); Nade 7 (Scott, 85). Subs not used: Cuthbert, Fox, Vaughan, Mathews, Barr . Booked: Thomson . Goals: Conroy 54, Nade 75 . Man of the match: Anderson . Referee: Bobby Madden . Attendance: 11,422 . Whoever would have thought Richard Gough was being kind when he branded this lot the worst Rangers team in history? They would have to improve to be mediocre. They are hanging on to miserable by their fingertips. Raith won this game, securing themselves a place in today’s quarter-final draw, with something to spare. In Grant Anderson, they had the best player on the park, while Christian Nade spent the entire afternoon buying time and space for his team-mates, holding the ball up and bringing others into play. A beautiful Ryan Conroy free-kick and a Nade tap-in — following another horrible howler involving Rangers keeper Steve Simonsen and his defenders — came either side of a debut goal from Haris Vuckic, who at least justified his inclusion in the team. Which is more than could be said for some of his more established team-mates. Seriously, Ian Black? If there is an example of a player’s career going from zenith to nadir in a more spectacular fashion, somebody should turn it into a book. Misery memoirs are always best sellers. The only time he earned a cheer was when the board went up for his substitution. Ryan Conroy had given Raith Rovers a shock lead at Ibrox after curling in a 20-yard free-kick . Rangers goalkeeper Steve Simonsen watches the ball fly into the net from Conroy's free kick . Conroy celebrates with his Raith Rovers team-mates after opening the scoring at Ibrox . Even then, he was immediately booed for appearing to dawdle off the park. It’s hard to see a way back for him now the fans have so unanimously turned against him. The way things are going at Rangers, of course, he and some of his under-performing team-mates could soon lose their places to a five-a-side unit of new loan signings, the first two of whom began their controversial Ibrox careers yesterday. The order to field all fit on-loan Newcastle United players saw centre-half Remie Streete replace Darren McGregor, while Fraser Aird lost his place on the wing to Vuckic. Streete limped off injured just before half-time. But the 20-year-old did a few decent things in his 43 minutes on the park. Vuckic got his goal and showed promise in flashes. To say he was one of the better Rangers players on the day may damn him with faint praise but, given time and a guaranteed run in the team, he should improve. As for what the imposition of him and his Newcastle mates does to the rest of the team, well, the early signs are not good. On loan Newcastle playmaker Haris Vuckic scores on his Rangers debut to level the scoreline at 1-1 . Vuckic celebrates with his team-mates but his joy was to be short-lived as the home side crashed out . Fans who had gathered for a muted protest before the game — their impact deadened by the Easdale brothers and chief executive Derek Llambias staying away — clearly don’t like anything spawned by the partnership between the current board and Newcastle owner Mike Ashley. There was widespread applause when a group of fans unfurled a banner showing a trainer stamping on two rats with pound signs in their eyes, one representing McGill’s Buses, the other Sports Direct. There wasn’t much else for the home crowd to cheer in a first half that saw Raith come closer to scoring than their hosts. Paul Watson thought he had broken the deadlock when his glancing header from a Conroy corner went fizzing towards the back post — only to strike the upright and bounce straight into the grateful arms of Simonsen. That was a let-off for Rangers, who looked bogged down in midfield, sluggish up front and far too open to the counter-attack and could not complain about being booed off at half-time. Raith? With Anderson a genuine threat on the flank, Kevin Moon adding energy to midfield and the redoubtable Dougie Hill leading the back line, they looked comfortable. Rangers fans protest against the board outside the ground before their game with Raith Rovers . Gers striker Kenny Miller advances forward with the ball and is chased by Rovers' Ross McCallum at Ibrox . Raith Rovers defender Dougie Hill slides in to tackle Rangers goalscorer Haris Vuckic . The second half began with Nade robbing the hapless Black before charging into the box and setting up a decent spell of pressure. They took the lead with 54 minutes gone, Conroy curling and dipping his left-footed free-kick over the wall and inside the post, a just punishment for Kyle Hutton diving in illegally to prevent Ross Callachan getting a shot on target from the edge of the box. When Vuckic equalised eight minutes later, well, there once was a time when that would have been the signal for a Rangers onslaught. Not here. Not now. Instead, it was Raith who grew stronger. The visitors stretched the opposition defence with surging runs and daring dashes. One of which produced the winner. Anderson was again involved, driving down the right wing and laying the ball off to captain Jason Thomson, whose fiery low cross should have been held by Simonsen — but was spilled under pressure from Raith sub Mark Stewart and at least two home defenders. Nade charged in to bury the loose ball. Raith deserved their win. Rangers deserved the chorus of boos and insults flung in their direction as they traipsed off the field, victims of a defeat that — given the ‘upsets’ suffered by the Ibrox club in recent seasons — qualifies as a Cup shock only on a technicality.

"Mohammed Shahin has been jailed for more than seven years for raping a passenger . A minicab driver has been jailed for more than seven years for raping a passenger who fell asleep as he drove her home. Vile Mohammed Shahin, 28, subjected his 20-year-old victim to what police described as a 'sickening attack' after picking her up in Leeds, West Yorkshire, where she had been on a night out. It was later found that Shahin had switched off the GPS tracking system that monitored his vehicle’s movements from the moment the woman got in, suggesting he had a sinister motive from the outset. The 28-year-old, from Bradford, pleaded guilty to rape and was jailed at Nottingham Crown Court to seven and a half years in prison. The judge also ordered that he be deported to his home country of Bangladesh after serving his sentence. The court heard that Shahin picked up his victim just off The Calls clubs and bar area of Leeds, after she had been on a night out with two friends whom she left to get into the cab in the early hours of September 30 last year. She asked to be taken to her home in Baildon but fell asleep on the way. When she woke, she found that Shahin had parked in a remote lane in an unknown location. He climbed into the back of the car and raped her before dropping her off near her home. Nottingham Crown Court heard how the driver parked his car in an unknown location, climbed into the back seat and attacked the woman . During the inquiry police issued an e-fit from a detailed description given by his traumatised victim. Shahin was arrested within weeks of the attack and charged with rape. After the case, Detective Chief Inspector Scott Wood, of West Yorkshire Police’s Homicide and Major Enquiry team, paid tribute to the woman’s bravery in providing crucial evidence to his team of detectives. 'Shahin abused of his position as a private hire driver to take advantage of a vulnerable woman and we are pleased to see him behind bars for the extremely serious crimes he committed,' said Detective Chief Inspector Wood. 'He subjected his victim to a sickening attack and we would like to give credit to her bravery in the way she dealt with the situation and assisted the police in bringing Shahin to justice.'","Mohammed Shahin imprisoned for seven and a half years for sex attack .

'When I first woke up after my leg had been amputated, I thought of my boyfriend. I worried whether he would still find me attractive and want to stay with me. 'And I worried about how my friends and family would cope.' Miss Green was eating a hot dog outside the Rockefeller Center when a cab driven by Faysal Himon jumped the kerb. Mr Himon claimed at the time that he was cutoff by a man on a bicycle, 41-year-old Kenneth Olivo, and then sped up to try and get around him, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle. Miss Green was at West 49th Street last August when she was hit by the taxi, which severed her foot resulting in the amputation . One year on from the incident Miss Green has gone on to complete her second year of university . Miss Green, left, is pictured with her friends at a party in October - two months after the accident . One year on from the incident Miss Green has gone on to complete her second year of university and is now engaged to her boyfriend, William Lord. She said: 'My family and friends have been fantastic. Some days I do feel a bit down but everyone is so positive. 'The way I look at it, I've lost a limb, not my life,' 'I tell myself every day that could have been so much worse. I'm so grateful to still be here.' Miss Green has revealed she still struggles to deal with the memories of the incident. She said: 'I can't use certain perfumes, or body cream because they take me back to when it happened. The trauma is still there. Sian Green has revealed she was 'ready to give up' moments after the crash . 'But I'm shocked with how far I've come, I'm proud of myself.' Sian received a prosthetic leg in November 2013 which enabled her to go back to University and live her life. She said: 'The clinic was so supportive and the staff made it seem like what they could do was limitless.' The sports fan now has three prosthetic legs, one for everyday life, one for swimming and her 'active leg'. 'The staff at the clinic have become like my second family, they made what happened so much easier.' Incredibly Miss Green took her first footsteps in November, just three months after the incident. She said: 'I remember thinking, ""wow, I'm actually walking"" and I broke down with relief.' Now she wants to help other amputees by setting up her own charity. 'In my opinion, there is no such word as can't and I want to prove that to other people in my position who have lost a limb,' she said. 'I really want to help amputees by raising money for those who need specialist care. 'I want to help people who have lost a limb realise they can live their life again, and get some normality back. It doesn't have to be the end of the world.' 'Not everybody gets the help I had and that's why I want to set up a charity.' Her sister, Stacey Green, 29, of Leicester, said: 'I'm extremely proud of Sian but not shocked. The last year she has been trying to concentrate on recovering and adapting to life as an amputee. 'We knew she would always be positive though. That's her, she dust's herself off and gets on with it. She has done so well.' In December last year it was reported that Miss Green was pursuing a $27.5 million lawsuit against Mr Himon and the City of New York - a lawsuit she filed after law enforcement officials announced that Mr Himon would not face any criminal charges. Sian Green, left, was worried about whether her boyfriend William Lord, right, would still find her attractive after  her leg was amputated. They are now planning to get married . Sian Green, pictured, has revealed she still struggles to deal with the memories of the incident. Now she wants to help other amputees by setting up her own charity . Plumber David Justino used his belt to make a life-saving tourniquet for Miss Green's leg . Incredibly Miss Green took her first footsteps in November, just three months after the incident . Miss Green's lawsuit against the city focused on the fact that Mr Himon's hack license should have been suspended before the August 20 accident because of prior driving violations. Prosecutors told Miss Green in November that there was not enough evidence to demonstrate that Mr Himon intended to hit her. Passersby rushed to help Miss Green immediately after the incident. Plumber David Justino used his belt to make a life-saving tourniquet for her leg. They were also helped by celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, better known on U.S. TV as Dr Oz, who hurried to the scene from his nearby office. Mr Himon later told reporters he was so horrified by the incident that he didn't want to be a cab driver anymore.","Sian Green lost lower leg after a New York taxi ploughed into her last year .

"North Korean soldiers danced in the streets and shopping centres of Pyongyang yesterday after it was announced that leader Kim Jong Un was named as head of the reclusive nation’s military. State media said in a special noon bulletin that North Korea’s military, government and political leadership had decided to award the top title to Kim, who already is supreme commander of the Korean People’s Army. It solidifies his standing seven months into Kim’s rule and follows several days of reshuffling at the highest levels of the military. Scroll down for video . Stand easy: North Korean soldiers from the Korean People's Army dance in Pyongyang following the Kim Jong Un announcement . Celebration time: Thousands of soldiers gathered following the announcement that Kim Jong Un would become the head of North Korea's military . The announcement of Kim Jong Un’s title as marshal and the presentation of the new military leadership comes just three days after the dismissal of army chief Ri Yong Ho, a high-ranking figure in both political and military circles and seen as a close adviser to Kim. The government said Ri was ill, but there was widespread speculation abroad of a military reshuffle at the top levels. The title of marshal - held previously by Kim’s father and grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung - is 'another brick in the wall of consolidating Kim Jong Un’s power, across party, state and military institutions,' said John Delury, a North Korea analyst at Yonsei University in South Korea. 'In the wake of Ri’s stepping down, it takes on added significance,' he said. 'Titles, of course, do not ensure authority. But the regime would appear to be closing ranks around their young leader.' Members of the military in North Korea had gathered to offer their new leader 'their highest glory and congratulations' New regime: Kim Jong Un, pictured here with former military chief Ri .

Choreographed: Kim Jong Un, who is already supreme commander of North Korea's army, is now the head of the nation's entire military . Soldiers and students in uniform filled the streets of the capital to celebrate, dancing and singing patriotic songs despite the rain. 'I am pleased that our cherished desire came into reality,' Kim Jong Gum, a student at the Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School dressed in a military uniform, told The Associated Press. 'July 18th: This day will be remembered in our hearts as another meaningful and auspicious day.' One by one, Kim Jong Un has collected top posts in the military and party, including first chairman of the National Defense Commission, first secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party, chairman of the party’s Central Military Commission and member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau. He was made supreme commander of the army in December, just days after his father’s death from a heart attack.

"A few came to praise the new arrivals, others to bury them under disapproval for the whole notion of anyone other than the manager - even an interim caretaker serving his notice - picking the team. On a day when Rangers fans had plenty to complain about, they at least managed to cheer one of the on-loan Newcastle United players shoehorned into their starting XI. And perhaps hope, amid the wreckage of their 2-1 Scottish Cup defeat at home to Raith Rovers, that Haris Vuckic’s goal-scoring debut is a sign of what to expect, once the rest of his mates are in harness. Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle United, celebrates scoring on his debut for Rangers . Despite Vuckic's strike, Rangers were knocked out of the Scottish Cup fifth round at home to Raith Rovers . Vuckic smashes in a shot from the edge of the area to equalise against Raith Rovers for Rangers . The midfielder (left) roars his delight after scoring as Kenny Miller jumps on his back to congratulate him . Of the five United men sent on loan to Rangers, only centre-half Remie Streete and winger Vuckic were deemed fit enough to play on Sunday; the command and control structure at Rangers does not, as yet, force the manager to field players medically unable to run the length of themselves. Streete didn’t even make it until half-time before adding himself to the list of the injured, so the 20-year-old didn’t have much of a chance to impress. Although the sight of him limping off after being outmuscled by Dale Carrick - not a big man - after 43 minutes might raise some questions over his ability to cope with the physical side of first-team football. Fellow debutant and loanee Remie Streete (left) was forced off after only 44 minutes through injury . Vuckic (right), one of five loanees from Newcastle to Rangers, is tackled by Raith's Ross Callachan . While on the pitch, he made one perfectly-time challenge to prevent a Raith counter-attack. And, erm, that was about it. Vuckic, a 22-year-old full international for Slovenia, had played a handful of first-team games on loan spells at Cardiff Cardiff City and then Rotherham United. On paper, he looked the best of the five new arrivals. Switching wings playing through the middle, Vuckic looked to have a decent touch and reasonable movement, although his first real chance to shine saw him run straight into the venerable Dougie Hill, a Rovers stalwart who has seen off more potent threats than him in his time. Streete looks on as he makes his debut at Ibrox for Rangers in the Scottish Cup fifth round on Sunday . Vuckic (left) smashes Rangers level at Ibrox in the Scottish Cup fifth round tie on Sunday . Caught in possession and wasteful on occasion, he showed the potential - and might have scored had a looping header and goalmouth scramble fallen differently just before half-time. Then, after looking a little lost as Raith took the lead and the home fans grew increasingly restless, Vuckic peeled away to receive a Kyle Hutton pass and score with superb low left-footed strike. It wasn’t his fault that his new team-mates couldn’t even hang on for a replay. Actually, having played in front of a mostly empty stadium in a rank rotten performance, do you think the player himself might be having second thoughts about this move?

"A graduate made to work for her jobless benefits as a shelf stacker in Poundland is taking legal action against the Government under the Human Rights Act. Cait Reilly, who studied geology at university, had been unable to find a job in her subject area and was claiming unemployment benefit while volunteering in a museum in the hope it would lead to a job in that sector. But the 22-year-old had to give up the placement in order to work in the budget store under a Government scheme designed to encourage the long-term unemployed back to work. Work experience: Cait Reilly said she had to sweep up and fill the shelves at the Poundland store in Kings Heath, Birmingham . Miss Reilly is now taking landmark . legal action against the Government after being told she risked losing . her £53.45-a-week Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) payment if she turned down . the two-week unpaid work experience stint at Poundland. Lawyers for the graduate are seeking a . judicial review into Department for Work and Pensions rules that compel . unemployed people to take unpaid work. They say the scheme, part of the . Coalition’s Work Programme to break the cycle of benefit dependency, . amounts to ‘forced labour’ and is against the Human Rights Act. The Government programme aims to help . around 250,000 young people over the next two years through training and . unpaid work experience in the public, private and charity sectors. Placement providers include chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Argos and . Asda. But Miss Reilly said: ‘I was actually . doing something that was helping me work towards a job and was taken . away from that to do something of no value to me. It was very . frustrating.’ The graduate was sucked into the . scheme after attending a retail jobs ‘open day’ in the autumn at the . suggestion of her Jobcentre Plus adviser, who said it would lead to a . period of training and a job interview. Miss Reilly and other candidates were . sent to an employment skills training workshop for a week, aimed at . improving attributes such as communication skills, followed by the . five-hour-a-day stint at Poundland near Miss Reilly’s home in King’s . Heath, Birmingham, in November. She and five other claimants spent . their time on the placement sweeping up and stacking and cleaning . shelves, before they had to attend a final week of training under the . ‘sector-based work academy’ scheme (SBWA). The promised job interview . never materialised. The SBWA scheme is supposed to offer the young unemployed a direct route off benefits and into work. Graduate: Miss Reilly has been looking for work since she left Birmingham University (pictured) and had been volunteering on an unpaid basis . Miss Reilly graduated from Birmingham . University in 2010 and has been claiming unemployment benefit since . August. She has now returned to her voluntary role at the city’s Pen . Room Museum of writing and pen trade memorabilia, still looking for paid . employment. She believes the placement allowed Poundland to use her as ‘free labour’ in the run-up  to Christmas. The DWP says that candidates who . ‘express an interest’ in doing unpaid placements will lose  their JSA if . they pull out after the first ‘cooling off’ week on the scheme. But . Miss Reilly says she was not informed about any cooling off period. In order to meet the criteria to . receive the Jobseeker's Allowance benefit, claimants are required to . participate in Employment, Skills and Enterprise Scheme. The scheme offers work placements . with companies, working in conjunction with the government, designed to . give claimants practical work experience to improve their chances of . employment. If claimants refuse to take part in the work placements they risk losing their benefits. She said she felt she had to do it because ‘without my Jobseeker’s Allowance, I would literally have nothing’. Miss Reilly’s solicitor, Jim Duffy, . said the practice contravenes article 4 (2) of the Human Rights Act, . which states: ‘No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory . labour.’ Mr Duffy, from Public Interest Lawyers . in Birmingham, said: ‘This Government has created – without . Parliamentary authority – a complex array of schemes that allow . Jobcentres to force people into futile, unpaid labour for weeks or . months at a time. ‘We have no problem with Government . schemes that increase the chances of people gaining employment – that is . key to combating the current economic crisis – but these “work for . benefit schemes” have been proven in other countries to do nothing other . than increase the cycle of unemployment and poverty. ‘Cait wasn’t told when she went to the . open day that she was committing herself to work for free. She has been . taken away from a voluntary role useful to help her break into the . career she would like to have, simply to stack shelves.’ Latest figures show there are now more . than one million young people not in employment, education or training – . so-called Neets. Employment minister Chris Grayling said: ‘We think . it’s really important to provide young people with the opportunity to . get into workplaces and show what they can do. ‘It’s a nonsense to suggest we should . just be leaving them on benefits without making a real effort to find . work. Retail offers really good career opportunities for many young . people.’ Poundland said it had a ‘positive . experience’ of the work placement programme which was ‘designed to . provide on-the-job training for those looking to retail as a  career . opportunity’. A furniture store has received more . than 1,300 applications for just 16 jobs at its new branch - just under . 87 candidates for each post at the DFS sofa centre in Llandudno, Wales. The company said it had been . 'inundated' with 1,385 applications for the 16 advertised positions at . the new store, which opens on February 18. Greg Robbins, Llandudno's Mayor, . welcomed the store and called for other companies to invest in the . resort, adding: 'It’s a very positive . thing for the town that a national company is coming here. 'I don’t know if desperation is the . word. It shows there’s a massive shortage of long-term employment jobs . and that we need further inward investment.' He added that he expected vacancies . at the proposed Travelodge in Llandudno to be similarly oversubscribed. It is expected to create 60 permanent jobs when it opens an 83-bed . hotel. Latest figures from the Office for . National Statistics show that 9.1 per cent of Wales’ workforce were . unemployed in the period of August to October 2011 - up from 8.4 per . cent between May and July last year. DFS area sales manager Adam Hankinson . said: 'I have been amazed by both the number of applications we’ve . received but also the high quality of the candidates. 'We’ve recruited a great bunch of . people and I’m really excited about creating a new local team who will . open the store within weeks.'","Cait Reilly has been looking for work since graduating in the summer .

"Researchers claim those of European descent still living on the continent are related to each other through a common ancestry dating back just 1,000 years . After centuries of almost endless conflict, it would be hard to claim Europe is one big family – but that's just what we are, say scientists. Those of European descent still living on the continent are related to each other through a common ancestry dating back just 1,000 years, they claim. Even people geographically separated by thousands of miles, such as a Briton and a Turk, are distantly related. University of California researcher Graham Coop said: 'What is remarkable is how closely everyone is related to each other. 'On a genealogical level, everyone in Europe traces back to nearly the same set of ancestors only a thousand years ago.' Professor . Coop made the claim after checking the DNA of more than 2,000 Europeans . for common segments that have been passed down the generations. As . these chunks of DNA get shorter from generation to generation, it is . possible to work out how far back they date – and so when we shared . ancestors. It might seem . incredible that everyone who was alive in Europe in 1013 and had . children is an ancestor of everyone on the continent today, the . researchers say that simple maths backs them up. This . is because the number of ancestors a person has doubles with each . generation – you have two parents, four grandparents, eight . great-grandparents and so on. The number grows so quickly that just 1,000 years back, or 30 generations, you have roughly one billion ancestors. This is far more than the population of the world, far less Europe, back then. As a result anyone from 1,000 years ago who left any descendants is related to every European alive today. The DNA analysis showed that the number of ancestors shared by two people falls the further apart the pair live. So someone from the UK is on average more related to another Briton than a German. However, they have more DNA in common with the German than with a Greek. However, there are some blips. For instance, people in Britain have more distant cousins in Ireland than they do here. A modern-day person living in the United Kingdom shares ancestors with people across Europe, according to a study from the University of California at Davis. This map shows the spread of ancestors up to 540 years ago. The larger the circle, the more ancestors of a certain person live in that location. You can see that even 540 years ago, the 'green' person had a small cluster of ancestors in other parts of Europe . Professor Coop made the claim after checking the DNA of more than 2,000 Europeans for common segments that have been passed down the generations . This, the journal PLoS Biology reports, is likely to be a result of migration from the smaller population of  Ireland to the larger one of the UK. David Balding, professor of statistical genetics at University College London, said that it only takes a small amount of movement for new genes to gain a foothold in a population. He said: 'You don't need a lot of migration, you just need some and that is pretty much what we see all through history, mainly through wars but also through trade and people looking for new pastures.' Geneticists have previously estimated that only have to go back 3,500 years ago for everyone in the world to be related. These maps show where the distant cousins of modern-day people in the UK live. Bigger circles mean more ancestors, and numbers give average number of shared genetic ancestors. The further back in time, the more widespread the shared ancestors. In other words, many of us can trace our roots back to the same colourful characters. The charity Sense about Science has warned this devalues expensive mail order tests that claim to trace a person's ancestry from a sample of their DNA. It also means that claims that someone is related to a famous figure such as Cleopatra or has Viking blood – are often as likely to be true for the person having the test as their boss or next-door neighbour. The researchers also revealed population spreads from other countries. The home country is starred, with populations over time shown in other colours .","Study looked at DNA samples from 2,000 people across Europe .

"A California mom has called upon the Girl Scouts to end their partnership with Nesquik after discovering a limited edition Girl Scouts milkshake by the Nestle offshoot contains almost 50 grams of sugar per bottle. Monica Serratos, of Orange County, told ABC News that she was recently in the supermarket with her two young daughters - both Girl Scouts - asked for the special 'Thin Mints' flavored Nesquik drink. The 14 Oz bottle - which also comes in a caramel coconut flavor, in keeping with the popular Girls Scouts cookie theme - prominently says the product is 'low fat'. Serratos was just about to allow her daughters- who are first and graders - are treat, before realizing there is 48 grams of sugar in each. That is 12 teaspoons of sugar. Thumbs down: The two Girls Scouts daughters of Monica Serratos with the Nesquik product and the equivalent sugar that is each bottle, which equates to 12 teaspoons . Stop marketing sugar drinks to children!: The petition on Change.org has garnered over 6,700 signatures . Liquid sugar: There are 48 grams of sugar in each bottle of the limited edition Girls Scouts-themed Nesquik drinks. The Nestle offshoot say each bottle is recommended as two servings . Controversial: The nutrition facts lists the total sugar as 24 grams, but is per one serving, and the bottle claims to serve two, which makes the total 48 grams of sugar . The American Heart Association recommends that children aged 4 to 8 restrict their sugar intake to three teaspoons a day. Pre-teens and teenagers are reccomended five to eight teaspoons a day. The Nesquik bottle says that it contains two servings. However it is typically consumed in one. Serratos subsequently started a petition on Change.org to convince Girl Scouts to end their partnership with Nesquik, believing they should be promoting healthy habits and not sugar-filled drinks. The petition is addressed to Anna Maria Chavez, the CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA. 'I’m demanding that Girl Scouts of America end its ties to Nestlé, stop the product sales of this liquid sugar and stop marketing unhealthy diet options to our children,' Serratos wrote in the petition. The Girl Scouts have not responded to the petition. Petition: The Change.org listing calls upon Girls Scout USA CEO Anna Maria Chavez . However Nesquik released a statement to ABC saying the drink is marketed towards adults. 'Nesquik has a limited licensing partnership with Girl Scouts USA,' the statement said. 'It borrows the fun and flavor equity of Girl Scout cookies and applies it to a 14 oz. ready-to-drink package made with the adult consumer in mind.' But Serratos hit back at that explanation. 'It's not being marketed toward adults,' she said. 'We're not interested in this little brown bunny on the bottle.' More than 6,700 people had signed her petition as of Thursday. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in the last 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"Barack Obama's tricky first presidential visit to Israel has had another glitch after the President was caught on an open-mic joking to the country's prime minister that the trip had allowed him to 'get away from Congress'. The off-the-cuff remark was made during a welcoming ceremony at Tel Aviv airport on Wednesday as Obama stood between Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As a trumpet fanfare played, Obama can be heard saying to Netanyahu: 'It's good to get away from Congress.' Scroll down for video . Woops! A microphone was on and picked up Barack Obama telling Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that it was 'good to get away from Congress' in Tel Aviv on Wednesday . Chuckles: Obama made the aside to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) who looked amused by the remark . Obama and Netanyahu both had a little chuckle over his remark before the U.S. President moved on to a meet and greet with Israeli officials. House Speaker John Boehner was asked about Obama's remarks by CNN's Jake Tapper later on Wednesday to which he gave a somewhat light-hearted response. Boehner said: 'I'd rather be heckled than ignored. Or as I like to say, you only tease the ones you love.' Obama's on-mic gaffe is the latest hiccup for the U.S. leader on his historic first trip to the Jewish state. First his $1.5 million armored car . known as 'Beast' broke down in embarrassing circumstances on Wednesday . morning and later it appeared that his Israeli hosts had dug up a . magnolia tree he planted in the name of peace. Lighthearted: Obama laughed as he stood with Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Netanyahu on his arrival in Tel Aviv . The . tree was brought over from the U.S. as a gift and was planted by Obama along with Israel's veteran . President Shimon Peres at his home in Jerusalem. Holding a press photo-call for the joint-planting, both presidents smiled as the sapling magnolia was put into the ground. President Obama told President Peres: 'It is an . incredible honor to offer this tree to this beautiful garden, and to . someone who is champion of the Israeli people and a champion of peace.' However, The Times of Israel and . Israeli news website Ynet reported that on the president's departure, . the tree was unceremoniously dug up by the agricultural ministry and . taken away to be tested for pests. Gift: Obama takes part in a tree planting ceremony at the residence of Israeli President Shimon Peres on Wednesday in Jerusalem . According to the Times of Israel, 'Plants cannot be brought in from abroad 'without undergoing a check' by the ministry, the report quotes the bureaucrats as saying. If this were April 1, we'd assume this was a wind-up.' 'As President of the United States Barack Obama has brought the plant with him and because agricultural products are not allowed into Israel from abroad without passing inspection - for fear diseases or pests are found on the plant itself - it will be uprooted for testing.' The tests could, according to Ynet take months - and only if it does will it be allowed to be re-planted in the president's home. A White House official did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment about the magnolia tree on Wednesday. During his diplomatic visit, Obama will have to navigate several hugely contentious issues such as Iranian nuclear ambitions, Palestinian relations and future of the Arab Spring. Meet and greet: Obama met with Israel's President Shimon Peres at his residence in Jerusalem on Wednesday . However, Ayelet Frish, a spokesman for Shimon Peres' office has denied that a diplomatic gaffe has occurred and said that Israel had been aware of the plans to bring the tree for months. He is not clear if the White House was aware that the tree would be dug up. Earlier, Obama's armored limo broke down on the way to the airport. The custom General Motors Cadillac limo was relegated to a pick-up truck after the driver accidentally put gas in the engine instead of diesel. Obama arrived in Tel Aviv on . Wednesday afternoon local time, and earlier that morning, the limo that . was designated to his hotel was unable to move after the driver made the . silly mistake. Local . news reports allege that it was the President's limo that was shipped . over specially from Washington that broke down so he was forced to use . the second vehicle that they brought over from the U.S. Touchdown: President Obama arrived in Israel on Wednesday for his first official trip to the region as President . Big mistake: The 18-foot car has an tank that holds 6.5 liters of diesel, and does not work when given gas . The United States Secret Service put out a statement about the incident, saying that it was a situation where it pays for them to be prepared. 'One of our protective vehicles experienced mechanical problems in Israel earlier today. This is why we bring multiple vehicles and a mechanic on all trips,' said Edwin Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service. 'Situations like this are planned for extensively by our advance teams so that the President's itinerary is unaffected by these types of issues.'",Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chuckled together at a welcoming ceremony at Tel Aviv Airport .

"A leading allergy doctor has debunked a host of myths, saying that gluten allergy doesn’t exist – and nor do hypoallergenic pets. Dr David Stukus, an allergy specialist from Columbus, Ohio, wrote a presentation debunking various common allergy misconceptions after years of hearing patients declare inaccuracies. One pet peeve is the patients who say they can’t eat bread because they’re allergic to gluten, he says. All in the bread? Gluten allergy - which deters many people from eating bread - is not actually a real affliction, a doctor has said. While wheat is a recognised allergy, many people  misinterpret that as gluten,' he says . ‘There’s this claim about “gluten allergy,” which really doesn’t exist,’ he told the website today.com. ‘It’s not really a recognised allergy. Wheat is a recognised allergy — but a lot of people will misinterpret that as gluten. Wheat allergy does not necessarily  equal an allergy to all gluten. He continued: 'Gluten has been blamed for all that ails humanity.'  In fact, there are only three disorders that can be scientifically attributed to gluten, he says: coeliac disease, wheat allergies and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. Coeliac disease is what's known as an autoimmune condition. This is where . the immune system  mistakenly . attacks healthy tissue. Patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) display gluten sensitivity symptoms - such as bloating, diarrhoea and stomach pain - but test negative for the disease despite symptoms disappearing on a gluten-free diet. ‘If you think you may have an allergy, you should see a certified allergist for proper evaluation, testing, diagnosis and treatment,’ Dr Stukus said. Non-existent: Hypoallergenic dogs, such as Bo, the Obama's dog, also don't technically exist, says Dr Stukus . Also in the firing line are so-called hypoallergenic dogs. Dr Stukus said: ‘Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog or cat. ‘Allergens are released in saliva, sebaceous glands and perianal glands. It's not the fur people are allergic to. 'It is true that some breeds are more bothersome for allergy sufferers than others’ – which is why some people are fine around some breeds and not others. Dr Stukus, whose work is being presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), argues that some of these allergy myths can be damaging to health – especially if people wrongly cut out large food groups from their diet – or skip vaccinations. He said: 'Many early medical beliefs have been . proven to be incorrect as research has advanced. Unfortunately, some of . these beliefs are still on the Internet, where an astonishing 72 per . cent of users turn to for health information.’ Another widely circulated myth is that people suffering from an egg allergy can’t have such jabs – as they may include tiny bits of egg protein. He explained: ‘Egg embryos are used to grow viruses for vaccines such as the flu, yellow fever and rabies shots.’ ‘However, it's now safe to get the flu shot, which can help prevent serious illness, but a referral to an allergist is recommended beforehand is recommended.’ he also advises against home allergy tests, which can be unreliable. ‘These tests might be able to reveal sensitisation, but being sensitized to a certain allergen, like milk, doesn't mean you're allergic. ‘These sort of at-home screening tests are not reliable and can often lead to misinterpretation, diagnostic confusion and unnecessary dietary elimination. ‘ . Coeliac disease is a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten -  a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Eating foods containing gluten can trigger a range of symptoms, such as: diarrhoea, bloating,    weight loss and extreme tiredness. Contrary to popular belief, coeliac disease isn't an allergy or an intolerance to gluten. It is in fact what's known as an autoimmune condition. This is where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In cases of coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. This damages the surface of the small bowel (intestines), disrupting the body’s ability to absorb nutrients from food.

"Dozens of North Korean soldiers are reported to have been killed in a fierce internal gun battle following the removal from office of army chief Ri Yong-Ho.Bullets smashed into nearby buildings as government soldiers and personal guards of the popular military chief turned on each other in an unprecedented affray in the secretive Stalinist country.Reports of the gun battle emerged in South Korea today as the North’s state television showed hundreds of uniformed soldiers literally dancing in the streets as they celebrated the elevation of Kim Jong-Un to the role of Supreme Leader and head of the nation’s military. Military leader Ri Yong Ho, left, was regarded as a mentor figure to Kim Jong Un, who took over as leader of North Korea following the death of his father in 2011 . It has not been established whether Mr Ri was injured or killed in the gun battle, which has been totally ignored by state television. Celebrations for Kim’s appointment as head of the military are the main focus of news from the capital, Pyongyang. But one source was quoted as saying that ‘we cannot rule out the possibility that Ri was badly injured or even died during the firefight when his guards possibly tried to protect him.’ Exactly why Mr Ri was removed from the high office remains unclear, even though the North Korean regime insisted that he had been allowed to step down due to illness. In South Korea, analysts said they had no doubt that Mr Ri had been sacked and might even have had to be physically removed from office. Right-hand man: Ousted army chief Ri Yong-Ho, left, pictured alongside Kim Jong-Un, right, at a mourning service for North Korea's former leader Kim Jong-Il in Pyongyang in 2011 .

Happier days: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, right, smiles with vice-marshal Choe Ryong Hae, director of the People¿s Army General Political Bureau (centre) and military leader Ri Yong-Ho, during a recent army parade in Pyongyang. A South Korean newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, said it had been told by government officials in Seoul that the gun battle erupted when vice-marshal Choe Ryong Hae, director of the People’s Army General Political Bureau, tried to detain Mr Ri.The officials said the vice marshal had been carrying out Kim Jong-un’s orders to sack him during a struggle for power in the core of Kim’s regime.Details of the gun battle have yet to emerge, but one report said bullets flew and as many as 36 soldiers – for and against Mr Ri – had died and many others had been injured. Pledge of support: North Korean soldiers promise their loyalty to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. While the North will be determined to suppress information about the reported gun battle, it was eager to show the world what support Kim had received following the ‘important announcement’ earlier in the week that late leader Kim Jong-Il’s son had became head of the military.Soldiers of the nation’s 1.2 million-strong armed forces were shown dancing in the streets of the capital and singing patriotic songs.

"The genetic makeup of Europe mysteriously transformed about 4,000-5,000 years ago, researchers have discovered. An Australian team found the unexplained change while analysing several skeletons unearthed in central Europe that were up to 7,500 years old. They say the rapid expansion of the Bell Beaker culture, which is believed to have been instrumental in building the monoliths at Stonehedge, could hold the key. Researchers say the rapid expansion of the Bell Beaker culture, which is believed to have been instrumental in building the monoliths at Stonehedge, could hold the key to why the genetic lineage of Europe mysteriously transformed about 4000 years ago . Beaker folk lived about 4,500 years ago in the temperate zones of Europe and received their name from their distinctive bell-shaped beakers, decorated in horizontal zones by finely toothed stamps. A warlike race, they were primarily bowmen and their extensive search for copper and gold greatly accelerated the spread of bronze metallurgy in Europe. Believed top be originally from Spain, the Beaker folk soon spread into central and western Europe in their search for metals. In central Europe they came into contact with the Battle-Ax culture and gradually intermixed and later spread from central Europe to eastern England, where it may have been responsible for erecting some of the megaliths at Stonehenge. 'What is intriguing is that the genetic markers of this first . pan-European culture, which was clearly very successful, were then . suddenly replaced around 4,500 years ago, and we don't know why,' study . co-author Alan Cooper of the University of Adelaide Australian Center . for Ancient DNA said. 'Something major happened, and the hunt is now on to find out what that was.' Ancient DNA recovered from a series of skeletons in central Germany up to 7500 years old has been used to reconstruct the first detailed genetic history of modern Europe. The study, published today in Nature Communications, reveals a dramatic series of events including major migrations from both Western Europe and Eurasia, and signs of an unexplained genetic turnover about 4000-5000 years ago. The research was performed at the University of Adelaide's Australian Centre for Ancient DNA. Researchers used DNA extracted from bone and teeth samples from prehistoric human skeletons to sequence a group of maternal genetic lineages that are now carried by up to 45% of Europeans. The international team also included the University of Mainz in Germany and the National Geographic Society's Genographic Project. 'This is the first high-resolution genetic record of these lineages through time, and it is fascinating that we can directly observe both human DNA evolving in 'real-time', and the dramatic population changes that have taken place in Europe,' says joint lead author Dr Wolfgang Haak of ACAD. 'We can follow over 4000 years of prehistory, from the earliest farmers through the early Bronze Age to modern times. 'The record of this maternally inherited genetic group, called Haplogroup H, shows that the first farmers in Central Europe resulted from a wholesale cultural and genetic input via migration, beginning in Turkey and the Near East where farming originated and arriving in Germany around 7500 years ago,' says joint lead author Dr Paul Brotherton, formerly at ACAD and now at the University of Huddersfield, UK. The team developed new advances in molecular biology to sequence entire mitochondrial genomes from the ancient skeletons. Beaker folk, lived  about 4,500 years ago in the temperate zones of Europe and received their name from their distinctive bell-shaped beakers, decorated in horizontal zones by finely toothed stamps . This is the first ancient population study using a large number of mitochondrial genomes. 'We have established that the genetic foundations for modern Europe were only established in the Mid-Neolithic, after this major genetic transition around 4000 years ago,' says Dr Haak. 'This genetic diversity was then modified further by a series of incoming and expanding cultures from Iberia and Eastern Europe through the Late Neolithic. 'The expansion of the Bell Beaker culture (named after their pots) appears to have been a key event, emerging in Iberia around 2800 BC and arriving in Germany several centuries later,' says Dr Brotherton. 'This is a very interesting group as they have been linked to the expansion of Celtic languages along the Atlantic coast and into central Europe. 'These well-dated ancient genetic sequences provide a unique opportunity to investigate the demographic history of Europe,' says Professor Cooper. 'We can not only estimate population sizes but also accurately determine the evolutionary rate of the sequences, providing a far more accurate timescale of significant events in recent human evolution.' The team has been working closely on the genetic prehistory of Europeans for the past 7-8 years. Professor Kurt Alt of the University of Mainz said: 'This work shows the power of archaeology and ancient DNA working together to reconstruct human evolutionary history through time. 'We are currently expanding this approach to other transects across Europe.' Genographic Project director Spencer Wells says: 'Studies such as this on ancient remains serve as a valuable adjunct to the work we are doing with modern populations in the Genographic Project. 'While the DNA of people alive today can reveal the end result of their ancestors' ancient movements, to really understand the dynamics of how modern genetic patterns were created we need to study ancient material as well.'","Researchers found genetic lineage of Europe mysteriously transformed about 4000 years ago .

"U.S. Secretary of . State John Kerry on Sunday called climate change perhaps the world's 'most fearsome' destructive weapon and mocked those who deny its . existence or question its causes, comparing them to people who insist . the Earth is flat. In a speech to Indonesian . students, civic leaders and government officials, Kerry tore into . climate change skeptics. He accused them of using shoddy science and . scientists to delay steps needed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases . at the risk of imperiling the planet. A day . earlier, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to cooperate more . closely on combating climate change. American officials hope that will . help encourage others, including developing countries like Indonesia and . India, to follow suit. Scroll down for video . WMD: John Kerry told a group of students that climate change is the most dangerous weapon of mass destruction the world faces . China and the United . States are the biggest sources of emissions of carbon dioxide and other . gases that cause the atmosphere to trap solar heat and alter the . climate. Scientists say such changes are leading to drought, wildfires, . rising sea levels, melting polar ice, plant and animal extinctions and . other extreme conditions. Also in the Jakarta speech, Kerry said everyone and every country must take responsibility for the problem and act immediately. 'We . simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the . climate conversation,' he said, referring to what he called 'big . companies' that 'don't want to change and spend a lot of money' to act . to reduce the risks. Kerry later singled out major oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders. 'We . should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and . extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts,' Kerry told the . audience at a U.S. Embassy-run American Center in a shopping mall. 'Nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits.' Flat Earth: Kerry dismisses those who don't believe in climate change as members of 'the Flat Earth Society' 'The . science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply . burying their heads in the sand,' Kerry said. 'We don't have time for a . meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society,' Kerry . said the cost of inaction will far outweigh the significant expense of . reducing greenhouse gas emissions that trap solar heat in the atmosphere . and contribute to the Earth's rising temperatures. He . outlined a litany of recent weather disasters, particularly flooding . and typhoons in Asia, and their impact on commerce, agriculture, fishing . and daily living conditions for billions of people. 'This . city, this country, this region, is really on the front lines of . climate change,' Kerry said. 'It's not an exaggeration to say that your . entire way of life here is at risk.' He added: 'In a sense, climate change can now be considered the world's largest . weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even, the world's most fearsome . weapon of mass destruction.' The solution, . Kerry said, is a new global energy policy that shifts reliance from . fossil fuels to cleaner technologies. He noted the President Barack . Obama is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to . their leaders to join. Front lines: Kerry said places like Jakarta were the 'front lines' of the effects of climate change . The U.S.-China . statement issued just after Kerry left Beijing on Saturday said the two . countries agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse . gases, including reducing vehicle emissions, improving energy efficiency . of buildings and other measures. Beijing and . Washington launched a climate change discussion last year, promising . progress in five areas: reducing vehicle emissions; advanced electric . power grids; capturing and storing carbon emissions; gathering . greenhouse gas data; and building efficiency.

Vladimir Putin is to snub Prince Charles at next month's ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day after the royal likened the Russian president to Adolf Hitler . At the June 6 Ceremony of Remembrance, at Sword Beach, world leaders and heads of state are expected to sit together. However Clarence House said today that there was no possibility of Mr Putin and Prince Charles meeting and that the Prince would leave 'immediately afterwards' avoiding the possibility of an awkward confrontation. The move came as a news source close to the Kremlin accused Prince Charles of risking an 'international scandal'. The website of major popular newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets ran a story headlined: 'Prince Charles compared Putin to Hitler, claim the media' and warned that Charles 'risks complicating the already far from cloudless relations between  Great . Britain and Russia'. It branded Charles' words an 'unexpected . announcement' and accused him of a 'badly chosen' moment for his claim, . coming ahead of the commemoration in less than a fortnight.

Russia and China were last night frantically haggling over the ‘deal of the century’ on gas and investment. Putin hopes to secure £240billion in guaranteed energy exports to China, making Russia far less dependent on Europe. The two sides were edging towards a ‘significant joint declaration’, including military plans, although Russian sources said they had  so far failed to agree on gas prices. As relations between Russia and the West deteriorated rapidly, China issued a friendly statement on Ukraine to Moscow and the nations conducted a joint naval exercise. Mrs Ferguson was given the chance to tell her incredible story to Charles as she showed him the museum’s exhibits. At the end of the visit, and surrounded by media, Charles made his off-the-cuff comment about the situation in Ukraine. It was heard by several witnesses. Mother-of-three Mrs Ferguson said: . ‘I had finished showing him the exhibit and talked with him about my own . family background and how I came to Canada. ‘The prince then said “And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler”. ‘I . must say that I agree with him and am sure a lot of people do. I was . very surprised that he made the comment as I know they [members of the . Royal Family] aren’t meant to say these things but it was very heartfelt . and honest. ‘I told the prince that while my family . and I were lucky to get a permit to travel, many of my other relatives . had permits but were unable to get out before war broke out on September . 1. They were sent to the concentration camps and died.’ Russia's President Vladimir Putin speaks to the media in Shanghai.

Lashing out at Moscow’s plan to issue passports to ethnic Russians in Crimea, she said: ‘Now, if this sounds familiar, it’s what Hitler did back in the 1930s.’ What is unusual, however, is for a senior royal to express an opinion publicly on such a clearly sensitive diplomatic issue. Charles is often criticised for meddling in domestic affairs of state as well as the infamous ‘black spider’ memos – so called because of his scrawling handwriting – that he is said to frequently write to ministers on issues close to his heart. But international issues, particularly one as sensitive as this, are considered taboo.","Prince Charles likened Putin's behaviour in Ukraine to that of Hitler .

"Social workers have been accused of 'misguided political correctness' after they considered sending a boy in their care to the Congo for a 'deeply traumatising' exorcism. Bosses at Islington Council in north London considered sending the African boy to the Democratic Republic of Congo because his mother claimed he was possessed by evil spirits and needed 'deliverance'. An expert has claimed that Islington council officials were 'mindful to agree to the request' for exorcism, which it is claimed involved starving children and sometimes beating them. Traumatising: Dr Richard Hoskins claimed African exorcisms on children can be 'disturbing and violent' (file picture) The boy's family, who were from Africa, had claimed an exorcism was necessary because he was possessed by 'kindoki' or evil spirits. The child's mother no longer has responsibility for him, and he had been taken into care by Islington Council. The local authority paid an expert over £4,000 to travel to Africa to investigate the possibility of an exorcism as they were worried the family's 'sensibilities might be affected'. Dr Richard Hoskins, an expert in African religion, completed the trip and advised the council the boy should not be exorcised as the rituals can be 'violent...deeply disturbing and traumatising'. Dr Hoskins has since told how the case - which Islington Council later dropped on his advice - highlights how British officials do not tackle abuse when it is 'masked behind multiculturalism'. African religion expert Dr Richard Hoskins said Islington Council were 'mindful to agree to the request' for the child to be exorcised . According to the Daily Telegraph, Dr Hoskins told a conference yesterday: 'We fear to trend where sensibilities might apparently be affected.' 'This problem is about the underlying failure to tackle abuse when it is masked behind multiculturalism.' Dr Hoskins added that officials do not challenge the mistreatment of children when it is committed under the guise of 'religious or cultural practices'. Dr Hoskins visited Kinshasa, the capital of DRC, in 2005, where he met the grandparents of the child. The grandparents claimed the boy had been 'infected by sorcery' in the UK which would 'destroy them all'. Church officials in Congo also claimed that the evil spirits would lead to 'strife, illness, divorce, hardship, poverty and death' if not dealt with. The ritual would have involved depriving the boy of food or fluids for three days in order to 'cast out' the evil spirit. Although Dr Hoskins was assured the boy would not be beaten, his investigation found evidence that other children who had been exorcised suffered violence and were left 'scared and traumatised'. He concluded his work, for which the council paid £4,372, by telling the authority the 'child should not be be allowed to go through a deliverance service such as that envisaged'. Dr Hoskins added: 'From my research I think this might be deeply disturbing and traumatising for him.' Islington Council acknowledged to the Telegraph that they had paid Dr Hoskins to go to Africa, but said they did so on the recommendations of a judge. A spokesperson said: 'It is a normal process in care proceedings to assess the extended family when a child has been removed from parental care,' a spokesman said. 'Dr Hoskins was instructed to meet with extended family members to assess their belief that a child of the family was possessed by spirits. This was on the instruction of the Family Court during care proceedings.' A spokesman for the Department for Education echoed the findings of Dr Hoskins, adding: 'It is not acceptable for councils to be considering this. These services can be extremely traumatic. 'We are tackling all forms of child abuse linked to belief, including belief in witchcraft or spirit possession. 'Such abuse is rightly condemned by people of all cultures, communities and faiths.'","Islington Council considered agreeing to parents' request for boy to undergo 'disturbing and violent' ritual .

"Social workers knew for six years that a teenage mother, murdered for bringing shame on the families of two Pakistani men who had used her for sex, was at clear risk from predatory Asian gangs. Laura Wilson, 17, from Rotherham had been groomed by a string of British Pakistanis before she was stabbed and thrown into a canal to die for informing her abusers' families of the sexual relationships. Her killer Ashtiaq Asghar, who was 18 at the time, . was given a life sentence and will serve a minimum of 17-and-a-half years after he pleaded guilty to . murdering Laura in October 2010. But it has now emerged that Rotherham . County Council's social services were well aware she was at risk and had . received information about certain adults suspected of targeting her . from the age of 11. Victim: Laura Wilson was stabbed and thrown into a canal for bringing 'shame' on the families of two Pakistani men who had groomed her for sex . Last week the council's Safeguarding Children Board published a serious case review but key passages which reveal they knew she was at particular risk from 'Asian men' had been blocked out with black lines. The council went to court in an attempt to tried to suppress the hidden information after a uncensored copy of the report was leaked to the Times newspaper but they have now abandoned legal action. The uncensored report confirms that Laura, identified as Child S, had dealings with 15 agencies and identified 'numerous missed opportunities' to protect her. It states that she eventually became 'almost invisible' to care professionals. Details hidden included the knowledge that at the age of 13 Laura and a friend had been given alcohol by men at a takeaway who then asked what she would give them in return. She had also been referred to a child sexual exploitation project just three months after her 11th birthday. Another censored passage reveals that Laura had been 'mentioned' during a 2009 police inquiry that eventually led to the conviction of five Pakistani men for sex offences against three underage girls. While the published report mentioned the fact that a friend, who Laura knew when she was 10, was 'thought to have become involved in sexual exploitation', it concealed the succeeding passage which read: 'with particular reference to Asian men'. Laura was murdered in October 2010. She was repeatedly knifed by 18-year-old Ashtiaq Asghar before pushed her into a South Yorkshire Canal, where he used the point of the knife to force her head below the surface as she fought to stay alive. Asghar was furious after the young mother revealed details of their sexual relationship to his Muslim family and was on ‘a mission to kill’. He exchanged a series of texts with married friend and mentor Ishaq Hussain, 22, who had also had an affair with Laura, and who the judge described as a man who regarded white girls as  ‘sexual targets, not human beings’. In one message, sent a day before he killed Miss Wilson, Asghar wrote: ‘I’m gonna send that kuffar (non-Muslim) bitch straight to Hell.’ In another he wrote: ‘I need to do a . mission.’ He talked of buying a pistol and ‘making some beans on toast’, . a reference to spilling blood used in Four Lions, a satirical film . about suicide bombers. Asghar . is serving life in prison after he pleaded guilty to . murder and was jailed for life. Mr Hussain was acquitted of murder by . joint enterprise after a retrial. Sentencing . Asghar, Lord Justice Davis told him: ‘I take the view you came under . the influence of Mr Hussain who is something of a mentor to you. 'He . seems to have regarded girls, white girls, simply as sexual targets. He . does not treat them as human beings at all. You got into that mindset . yourself. ‘You no doubt once had feelings for Laura but treated her with contempt in the latter stages.’ Murder: Laura was stabbed repeatedly by 18-year-old Ashtiaq Asghar before being thrown into this South Yorkshire canal to die . Killer: 18-year-old Ashtiaq Asghar . was furious after Laura revealed details of their sexual relationship to his Muslim family. He was sentenced to life and will serve a minimum of 17 years . In . 2007, when Laura was 13, she and her family appeared on The Jeremy Kyle . Show. During the programme – about out-of-control children – her sister . warned her that ‘your attitude is going to get you in big danger’. Workers . at a child sexual exploitation project later sent a report to social . services, but no action was taken to remove her from what became a . continuing spiral of sexual abuse. By the time she was 16, she had embarked on an affair with Mr Hussain, who was then 20 and already married. She gave birth to a daughter in June last year, but Mr Hussain refused to accept that the child was his. Four months later, and just days before she was murdered on October 12, she ‘shamed’ Asghar and Mr Hussain by informing their families of her relationship with both men. She told Asghar’s mother she loved her son and ‘wanted to have babies’ by him. But Mrs Asghar was furious and attempted to hit Miss Wilson with a shoe, branding her ‘a dirty white bitch’ who should ‘keep your legs closed’, the trial was told. Alan Hazell, Chair of the Rotherham Local Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'We refute in the strongest possible terms any suggestion that information was redacted from the published report for any reason other than to protect the interests of Laura’s daughter, immediate family and other third parties.' In a statement following the publication of the review  Mr Hazell denied that more could have been done to save Laura. He said: 'This is a wide ranging study which shows a very complex situation surrounding Child S and her child which made it difficult for agencies to engage with her. 'There is no suggestion that anyone could have saved Child S from what ultimately happened to her but clearly her care could have been improved. A spokesman for Rotherham Council said the passages had been redacted . 'to protect the interests of Laura's daughter, immediate family and . other third parties' There were chances for those agencies to be more proactive in how they dealt with the case and all agencies involved accept that and apologise that the standards of service were not as high as they should have been. 'It is vital that agencies learn from what happened here and there is clearly a commitment in Rotherham to make that happen. As the report comments, there are already many initiatives in place to ensure that services are now improved.' Last month following the trial of nine men, mainly of Pakistani origin, who were found guilty of raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with drink and drugs Tory cabinet minister Baroness Warsi hit out at the 'small minority' of Pakistani men who see white girls as 'fair game' for sexual abuse. She told London’s Evening Standard newspaper: 'There is a small minority of Pakistani men who believe that white girls are fair game. 'And we have to be prepared to say that. You can only start solving a problem if you acknowledge it first. 'This small minority who see women as second class citizens, and white women probably as third class citizens, are to be spoken out against.'","Laura Wilson, 17, from Rotherham .

"Per Mertesacker accepted Arsenal undid all of their recent good defensive work by not being 'switched on' in allowing Tottenham to come from behind to win the north London derby 2-1 at White Hart Lane. The Gunners had looked set for another positive away performance when they snatched the lead through a fine volley from Mesut Ozil after 11 minutes. However, Spurs soon regained momentum as Arsenal struggled to deal with the impressive midfield work-rate from Mauricio Pochettino's men. Per Mertesacker (centre) admits Arsenal weren't defensively switched on during their 2-1 defeat to Tottenham . Mertesacker (left) and the Arsenal defence failed to contain the threat of Spurs' Harry Kane in the second half . Kane (second left) rises highest to head the ball expertly into the corner to give Tottenham the win vs Arsenal . The industry of the home side was rewarded when Harry Kane swept in an equaliser as he ghosted in unmarked at the far post when Arsenal failed to deal with a corner at the start of the second half. Just when it seemed Arsenal had done enough to maintain their recent unbeaten run, another lapse in concentration at the back allowed in-form Kane to get between Laurent Koscielny and Nacho Monreal to head home Nabil Bentaleb's deep left-wing cross. Arsenal - who had won five successive matches ahead of Saturday's poor display, including a battling victory at Manchester City - find themselves below Spurs in sixth place in the Barclays Premier League and must now regroup quickly for Tuesday night's visit of bottom club Leicester to keep the pressure up on the top four. 'We found a way recently to prepare ourselves on crosses better defensively (and also) on set-pieces, but we did not switch on quickly enough and were not up for proper defending, so that was worse than in recent weeks,' Mertesacker said on Arsenal Player. 'We were not active enough and only started to play our game a bit towards the end, that took us too long. Mertesacke (right) challenges Tottenham midfielder Mousa Dembele for the ball during their encounter . 'When we had the ball, we could not find any solutions, they were always at us and we could not get the ball quickly in our own half so we could not hurt them on the counter-attack.' The German, who is captaining the side with midfielder Mikel Arteta still injured, added: 'We have to analyse the problems they caused us, then we focus on Tuesday to bounce back from this setback as quickly as possible.' Gunners boss Arsene Wenger accepted his side paid a heavy price for 'too many technical mistakes in the middle of the park' and was also less than impressed at the way Spurs crafted a late winner. He said: '(For the second goal) Kane had a completely free header in the box, with five minutes to go, that is difficult to understand with the experience we have at the back. 'I am disappointed by the quality of our football and it was just not good enough.' Gunners boss Arsene Wenger was unimpressed by his side's defending for Kane's late winner . Arsenal are expected to have leading scorer Alexis Sanchez back from a hamstring problem on Tuesday, while Theo Walcott is pressing for a recall having been left on the bench as fit-again Danny Welbeck started at White Hart Lane. Wenger maintains Leicester will be no pushovers, despite being rooted to the foot of the table after a third-straight league defeat when beaten 1-0 at home by Crystal Palace, if his team do not produce the required performance. 'We play at home against Leicester, a team who fight not to go down,' said Wenger. 'We have to recover from the disappointment and be ready to respond very quickly.'

"Two Texas men who were convicted of raping and shooting a woman almost 30 years ago were exonerated yesterday after DNA tests in Dallas County implicated others in the crime. As Judge Susan Hawk apologised to James Curtis Williams and Raymond Jackson and declared them formally innocent of aggravated sexual assault, 10 other exonerated men watched in the audience. Williams and Jackson were convicted of attacking a woman outside a Dallas bar in November 1983 and sentenced to life in prison. The woman was forced into a vehicle at gunpoint, sexually assaulted, shot and left for dead in a field. Scroll down for video . Innocent: Judge Susan Hawk apologised to James Curtis Williams and Raymond Jackson and declared them formally innocent of aggravated sexual assault . Reunited: With James Curtis Williams and Raymond Jackson, Dallas County has now cleared 32 convicts in the past decade . ‘I hope that you feel like justice was served for you today,’ Hawk said. 'It's heartbreaking and to say I'm sorry is not enough. But I hope you both have very full and happy lives. Congratulations.' Williams and Jackson shook hands with Hawk and Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins, who also apologised. Dallas County has now exonerated 32 people since 2001, most of them during Watkins' tenure. Most of the cases, including Monday's, involved faulty eyewitness identifications. Watkins questioned the criminal justice system's fairness and whether black people were being mistreated. ‘I think we see the similarities in these men and the two that are being exonerated today that has not been addressed,’ he said. Wrongly-convicted: Raymond Jackson, left, and James Curtis Williams, right, spent nearly 30 years behind bars for a crime they did not commit . Charged: Marion Sayles, left, and Frederick Anderson, right, have now been charged with attempted capital murder for the 1983 Dallas attack . 'We need to address that here in Dallas . County, in our state and in this country. We are doing something wrong . with our criminal justice system and we need to fix it.’ Now the wrongly-convicted in Texas have joined forces to create the Texas Exoneree Project, helping newly released men rebuild their lives. 'You wish you can help get everybody get out of prison that don't supposed to be there, but you know you are not going to be able to do it,' Christopher Scott, who was wrongly convicted of a murder in 1997, told CBS. Scott was wrongly identified by a witness and served 13 years behind bars, until the real killer confessed. 'We have a lot of people say: ""Man we know how you feel."" Man, you don't know how I feel. The only person that know how I feel is the guy that has been in position like me. He know how that feel,' Scott told CBS. Williams and Jackson certainly do. Both men were included in a photo lineup in the 1983 case because they had been implicated in a separate sexual assault. Exonerated: Christoper Scott served 13 years behind bars for a murder he did not commit before the real killer confessed. He now helps run the Texas Exoneree Project . The victim picked them out of the photo . lineup and later identified them in court. They were convicted by an . all-white in January 1984. But DNA from the woman's clothing and a rape kit exam was preserved and later tested. The results implicated two other men, Frederick Anderson and Marion Doll Sayles. They have now been charged with attempted capital murder, which does not have a statute of limitations, authorities said. Jackson, 67, said he was already out on parole when the test results came back, clearing him and Williams. He did not blame the victim. 'She just made a mistake in identity, and I'm just thankful that they had DNA and kept ours,' Jackson said on Monday. Williams and Jackson pleaded guilty in the other sexual assault case and served shorter sentences for that. Jackson is still on parole for a robbery committed in 1970. He said he hoped to start a business. Williams said things were 'very complex,' but that his life had been greatly changed. 'It inspires me to do to the same, to go on with my life and do good to others,' he said. Watch video here .","Dallas County has now exonerated 32 people since 2001 .

"Men are twice as likely to injure themselves in the bedroom . One in 20 Brits have injured themselves having sex, a new report reveals today. And men are twice as likely to get hurt in the bedroom as women, the study into muscular injuries found. It paints a picture of a country of passionate lovers - but in fact as a nation we're actually most likely to come to harm gardening than anywhere else. More than one in three Britons have pulled a muscle exercising their green fingers (35 per cent), a poll of 2,000 men and women shows. Other common ways to pull a muscle include carrying heavy shopping bags (30 per cent), doing DIY (21 per cent) and having sex (five per cent). There's a gender divide, however, when it comes to aches and pains. Men are three times more likely to injure themselves playing sport than women (27 per cent and nine per cent). And twice as likely in the bedroom (6 per cent and three per cent). The fairer sex, on the other hand, are three times more likely to pick up a sprain on the dancefloor (9 per cent over 3 per cent). And . they would seem to be clumsier - women are nearly twice as likely to . injure themselves falling over (29 per cent over 17 per cent). Back ache is the nation's number one muscular injury woe, putting 15 per cent of Brits out of action for a fortnight or more. Far from a country of passionate lovers - as a nation we're actually most likely to come to harm gardening than anywhere else . Next up are muscle strains (9 per cent), muscle inflammation (7 per cent) and neck ache (6 per cent). But while Brits might miss out on their next football match, run or gym session, they won't skip the office. Just one in 10 surveyed said they had taken any time off for muscle-related injuries (10 per cent). Three per cent of those had taken 21 days off or more and a worrying number of us ignore or mistreat injuries, research conducted by pain relieving gel Polar Frost revealed. 1. Gardening (35 per cent) 2. Carrying heavy bags (30 per cent) 3. Falling over (24 per cent) 4. DIY (21 per cent) 5. Sport (18 per cent) 1. Gardening (36 per cent) 2. Carrying heavy bags (34 per cent) 3. Falling over (29 per cent) 4. Cleaning (24 per cent) 5. Dancing / Sport - (both 9 per cent) Around one in five adults injure themselves playing sport (18 per cent) but four in 10 rely on painkillers alone to treat it (39 per cent). A cautious one in seven rest in a bid to solve the problem (14 per cent), but the same proportion do nothing about it (14 per cent). GP Doctor Sarah Jarvis warned leaving injuries untreated can spell problems in the future. Dr Jarvis said: 'By leaving an injury untreated, a once fixable problem can result in long term, serious implications. 'With so many wonderful sporting events taking place in the UK inspiring people to get into sport it's essential we also educate people on how to stay healthy and treat minor niggles. 'Using cold gels, elevation and compression will get them back up and out again as soon as possible.'","Brits are most likely to injure themselves gardening .

Whether zooming in on the Shard, . or picking up a group of friends playing football in the park, the . picture offers an immediate taste of life in the city. Photographers spent three days painstakingly capturing the city while enduring sub-zero temperatures, making sure that every inch was covered. The 320 gigapixel image (320 billion pixels) took a further three months to finalise, as technicians from photography firm 360Cities amalgamated the images and welded them into a final vista. The completed interactive image - 64,000 times more detailed than a standard iPhone snap - would measure 98 metres in width and 24 metres in height if printed in 2D.

"On the run: Killer Lee Wheeler was let out of prison on day release and did not return . A man who stabbed his best friend to death in an argument over a camera has gone on the run from prison. Police are hunting for Lee Wheeler after he absconded while on day release from Sudbury prison in Derbyshire. He is currently three years into a 10-year sentence for manslaughter over the death of Leon Kerr. Wheeler, 33, was allowed out on day release on December 23, but never returned to prison, prompting a police manhunt. After the news of his escape emerged, his victim's widow said she was furious that he had been able to abscond from jail. 'I'm disgusted that Lee has absconded,' said Paula Hendrickson-Kerr. 'It was such a shock and now the shock has turned to anger. 'I knew one day he would be eligible for day release, but not this soon - he's not serving his time for the terrible thing he did. 'It isn't fair that Leon will never spend Christmas with his family and that Lee has escaped, all we have is a pile of earth to visit. 'I wasn't happy with the sentence when it was made, it wasn't enough for what he did. 'Lee should give himself up and serve his time.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said today: 'We are following a number of lines of enquiry to trace him and believe he may be staying in the Birmingham area. 'If you've seen him or have any information that could help, please call 101 as soon as possible.' Victim: Wheeler is serving a 10-year prison sentence for killing his childhood best friend Leon Kerr, pictured here on his wedding day with wife Paula . Wheeler was jailed in 2010 after pleading guilty to manslaughter following the death of his childhood friend Mr Kerr, 29. The pair fell out at a party for Mrs Hendrickson-Kerr's birthday, when a camcorder went missing and Mr Kerr accused Wheeler of stealing it. The victim went to confront his friend at his house in Birmingham, but Wheeler then grabbed two knives from the kitchen and waved them at Mr Kerr. During the ensuing fight, Wheeler apparently stabbed Mr Kerr, and although he then tried to save his life the victim died and his killer fled the scene, before handing himself in to police the next day.","Lee Wheeler, 33, was serving 10 years for the manslaughter of Leon Kerr .

"Labour MP Keith Vaz yesterday warmly greeted migrants arriving from Romania and Bulgaria – before calling for a referendum on free movement within the European Union. Mr Vaz, the influential chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the British people needed to decide if the rules which allowed free-flowing migration across the continent should be changed. His comments came as controls on migrants from the two impoverished Eastern European countries lapsed at midnight on New Year’s Eve. Scroll down for video . Greetings: Mr Vaz meets new arrivals from Romania Julian Barbat, centre, and Victor Spirescu . As he greeted migrants at Luton airport, Mr Vaz said: ‘The British people need to decide if you are changing something like freedom of movement. At the end of the day it has to be a referendum.’ He told Sky News: ‘It needs to be part of negotiations for a reformed EU, because freedom of movement is very important. ‘It’s one of the cornerstones of the EU and we need to have a proper discussion, and that means at the end of the day the British people have to make that decision.’ From yesterday, citizens of both Romania and Bulgaria could move freely to Britain and have full access to jobs in this country. The reluctant Romanians roped in for the greater glory of Keith Vaz looked as baffled as all the rest of us . Labour MP Keith Vaz turned up at Luton Airport this week to greet Romanians in the arrivals lounge . Pleased to be here: Mr Spiresau told the Labour politician that it was his first visit to Britain and that he was to work in a London car wash so he could send money back to his family . This has prompted fears of a rush of migrants similar to that seen in 2004, when eight Eastern European countries joined the EU. Critics have warned a new surge in . migrant numbers will put further pressure on hard-pressed public . services, including schools and hospitals. They have also questioned whether more workers from abroad are needed at a time of high youth unemployment in the UK. Ministers have refused to predict how many new arrivals will come – but have downplayed suggestions of a huge increase. Mr Vaz was joined by a senior committee member, Tory Mark Reckless, at Luton airport. Touchdown: Passengers arrived in the UK on board a Wizz operated airliner, flight number W63701 from Tirgu Mures in Romania (pictured) New arrivals: Some of the Romanians on board said they were here to work and send money back home while others were already settled here and returning after Christmas .

Maya Betranova with her friend Evelina Goargieva who can now work in the UK . New arrivals: Dimi Dimitrov with his wife Dida who can now work in the UK . They met Victor Spirescu, 30, who said he planned to initially wash cars in Britain, before moving into construction. ‘I don’t come to rob your country. I come to work and then go home,’ he said. Medic: 35-year-old Adrian Pop is an emergency doctor back in Romania who had come to the UK to work in a hospital near London . ‘I . don’t want to stay here. I want to renovate my home and to make a good . life in Romania because it’s much easier to live in Romania because it’s . not expensive.’ Mr Reckless warned that an increase in Romanian and Bulgarian numbers could mean Tories miss their immigration target. David . Cameron has pledged to cut net migration – the number migration adds to . the population each year – from around 250,000 a year in 2010 to below . 100,000 by 2015. Currently it stands at 182,000. Mr . Reckless said: ‘I’m here this morning because my party – the .

"Dwight Yorke slammed Manchester United for their 'lackadaisical' performance in the first half at West Ham United - claiming they were not set up to 'play the United way'. Fellow Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher was equally scathing in his criticism of Louis van Gaal's side, stating that Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie 'are too similar' to play together. In a poor first half, Man United created little and lacked any sort of invention, leading to the duo's remarks. Robin van Persie (left) and Radamel Falcao (centre) struggled for Manchester United at Upton Park . Van Persie, pictured against West Ham United, and Falcao were labelled 'lackadaisical' by Dwight Yorke . Falcao (left) and Van Persie 'are too similar to play together' according to Jamie Carragher . Speaking on Sky Sports, Yorke said: 'I have not seen the ball fizzed around. The movement (up front) is lackadaisical. 'At the other end, (Diafra) Sakho and (Enner) Valencia are moving the United defence around, but they (Man United) are stagnant and this is not the United way. 'We like to see movement and space created for other players to get into. They (Falcao and Van Persie) are easy to play against.' In addition to Yorke's comments, Carragher was also bemused as to why Van Gaal had opted for the duo of Falcao and Van Persie up front. The former Liverpool centre back insisted the Man United boss should turn to young striker James Wilson in the second half.

I am looking at the lack of movement compared to Sakho and Valencia. 'I am not saying these players (Falcao and Van Persie) are bad players, but it is not a partnership. 'I think they are too similar. They are standing still. There is no energy. They have spoken at times about United’s slow play. 'Now, is it down to the passing or is it down to the lack of movement? That is what they have got to change - they have been world-class strikers but as a partnership it is not working.

"England’s players are braced for a harsh post-mortem at their Surrey HQ on Monday despite the supreme quality of Friday’s victory over Wales. The magnitude of the result will not ensure immunity from criticism as the national team strive to build on an impressive start to their RBS 6 Nations campaign. There was an abundance of English gallantry and class on show at the Millennium Stadium but the quest to raise standards ahead of Saturday’s clash with Italy at Twickenham means the review process will highlight every error, however trivial. England centre Jonathan Joseph scored the decisive try of the game as they won 16-21 against Wales . Joseph (left) evaded two tackles to breach the Wales defence before scoring under the posts . Head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants won’t attempt to sugar-coat the debrief. Instead, they want to refocus minds after the 21-16 triumph in Cardiff. Any trace of euphoria will be banished, any hint of complacency resisted. There will be a concerted effort to adopt the never-satisfied mentality of a champion team, which is what England are desperate to become. Wasps captain James Haskell delivered a barnstorming performance in Cardiff but even in the aftermath of a famous victory, he said: ‘Come the Monday review we will be hard on ourselves. The mark of a good side is being tough on yourselves in victory — go away, learn, prepare for a big week and it all starts again next Saturday.’ Asked if he expected to face harsh video analysis on Monday, the flanker added: ‘Oh, 100 per cent, 100 per cent. If you’ve got any ambitions to be a world-class side, you have to be really tough on yourselves. England's stars celebrated their win in the dressing room - but they won't be dwelling on it for too long . Joseph (centre) is mobbed by his England team-mates as they celebrate his second half try against Wales . ‘The coaches will do a big presentation then the boys will do one-on-one feedback. ‘I’ll have to go through my game rigorously and I’m sure there are lots of things I can improve on. To get a win like we did is very special, so I think we’ll allow ourselves a few hours to smile, then the job will start again.’ This week’s challenge for the England management is to somehow recreate the intensity of their build-up to the Wales game. Facing Italy at Twickenham is, in truth, a banker. The hosts will be determined to reveal a ruthless streak in the way they set about demonstrating their superiority, no matter how convincing their public utterances about taking nothing for granted. One especially heartening aspect of the win over Wales was the level of composure and leadership in the visitors’ ranks. Captain Chris Robshaw set an authoritative tone in the tunnel before kick-off with his refusal to take to the field when first requested, amid concerns that the opposition would keep his players waiting for too long in the bitter cold. Youngs brothers Tom (left) and Ben are all smiles as England defy their underdogs tag and beat Wales . Anthony Watson is mobbed by his England team-mates after scoring against Wales in the Six Nations . His defiant stance sent out the right message. His expression of stern conviction spoke volumes about a man who has grown into the role. Robshaw was standing up for his players and they responded by fighting their way out of what Lancaster called a ‘big hole’ after going 10-0 down. ‘We weren’t particularly panicked,’ said Haskell, referring to that early scoreline and the reaction to it. ‘We knew that if we stayed in the mix, looked after the ball and played in the right areas, we’d challenge Wales. We managed to do that. ‘At half-time we came in, re-grouped and knew we were in the game. We played sensible rugby, looked after the ball and kept our discipline.’ This ability to adapt calmly on the hoof was a sign of increasing English maturity. Haskell spoke of his aim to make good decisions and that has evidently been a priority across the board. There were clear heads under pressure, as illustrated by two astute kicks from Mike Brown — one in restricted space to set up Anthony Watson’s try and another which found touch deep in Wales territory late on to help his team turn the screw. James Haskell (blue scrum cap) bounced back off the post protector at the Millennium Stadium on Friday . England players celebrate at the full-time whistle as they record a memorable victory over Wales . Lancaster has often referred to the ‘leadership group’ in the squad and — despite the loss of several key men to injury — it was very much in evidence on Friday. It certainly helped that Robshaw could call upon the support of four club captains in the starting XV — Haskell, Joe Marler (Harlequins), Dylan Hartley (Northampton) and Ben Youngs (Leicester). ‘Having leaders from clubs in the side can only help to support Robbo,’ said Haskell. ‘Obviously the buck stops with him and he’s got to have the final say but the “small talk”, as we call it, helps the boys to keep their heads on. ‘When we look at some of the best sides in the world — especially when we look at New Zealand — they’ve got a lot of experienced players there who have been through so many situations before. ‘We had some boys who had never played a game in Cardiff, so it was important to stay calm and keep making the right decisions. The best teams in the world do that.’ England are not in that category just yet but they took a giant stride in the right direction against Wales — not that the players will be allowed to savour the feat any longer.","England began their Six Nations campaign with an impressive victory .

"Daley Blind scored late on to rescue his side a point as Manchester United struggled to cope with Sam Allardyce's West Ham. West Ham looked like they were going to claim the win thanks to Cheikhou Kouyate's opener until Blind struck late on. Here, Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham rates each player as the Hammers moved to within four points of the Red Devils. WEST HAM (4-1-2-1-2) Adrian - 7.5 . Great save with his foot to deny Van Persie who was in acres of space inside the box in the final 10 minutes and was sharp all afternoon. West Ham goalkeeper Adrian clutches on to the ball as Manchester United ace Radamel Falcao watches on . Carl Jenkinson - 6.5 . Close to scoring with a right-hand side cross which dipped over De Gea and almost into the top left corner but fell narrowly wide. Cheikhou Kouyate - 8 . Started the game in central defence instead of his usual midfield position but played like a striker as he took a touch on the turn to score the opener. Cheikhou Kouyate impressed as a makeshift defender and managed to get on the scoresheet . James Tomkins - 7 . Came close to breaking the deadlock with a back-post header from Aaron Cresswell’s ball. Dealt with Van Persie and Falcao well. Aaron Cresswell - 6.5 . His accurate delivery on long free kick duty ramped the pressure on a United side who were struggling to keep organised at the back. Hammers defender Aaron Cresswell kept a close eye on Red Devils winger Adnan Januzaj . Alex Song - 6 . Almost gifted United an opener right at the start after passing to Van Persie inside his own box but Kouyate managed to cover. Mark Noble - 6.5 . Great ball into the box from a free kick which United failed to clear allowing Kouyate to score West Ham’s first goal. Kevin Nolan - 6 . He seemed to have little impact on proceedings, on current form unable to reach the heights . West Ham skipper Kevin Nolan puts pressure on Wayne Rooney during the Premier League encounter . Enner Valencia (right) consistently posed a problem for West Ham in their draw at home to United . Stewart Downing - 6 . Went quietly about his business in behind the to forwards, passing well and helping West Ham retain possession for long periods of the game. Enner Valencia - 7 . Tested De Gea twice within a minute with a rasping 25-yard drive then close-range effort. Diafra Sakho - 6.5 . Alongside Valencia the pair formed a formidable partnership up top that was hard for United’s defence to handle. Strong, bustling and battling. Manchester United duo Rooney and Marcos Rojo attempt to close down West Ham's Diafra Sakho . Subs . Matt Jarvis (Enner Valencia 84) Sam Allardyce . Unfortunate not to come away with the win. Tactically he got it spot-on, playing some attractive football along the way, but they were finally broken in the dying minutes of the game. MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-2-1-2) David de Gea - 7 . Superb double save to stop Valencia twice within the space of a minute and then a third with his right foot denying Tomkins, until he was finally breached. Kept two more out late on, too. David de Gea made a number of fine saves before West Ham opened the scoring in the 49th minute . Antonio Valencia - 6 . A threat going forward, providing another option on the right flank, but too much of a liability in his defensive positioning. Phil Jones - 6 . Didn’t look the right fit alongside Rojo in the centre of United’s defence. He had a solid game, but not his greatest. Marcos Rojo - 5.5 . Had a torrid afternoon trying to deal with the power of Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia and was booked for a late challenge on James Tomkins. Not his best game. Luke Shaw - 5 . Made attempts to stretch West Ham down the left-hand side by over-lapping Januzaj but his match was marred by the sending off in stoppage time for two yellows. Daley Blind - 7 . Did the required job in front of the back four then popped up with the equaliser at the death. Daley Blind, pictured with Stewart Downing, was deployed in defensive midfield for the match in east London . United captain Wayne Rooney (right)  struggled to ignite his team's play at Upton Park . Wayne Rooney - 6 . Tried to pull the strings from the centre of midfield but United then lacked his dynamism up front. Kouyate’s goal came off his shoulder when he should’ve jumped in to block. Adnan Januzaj -  6 . Kept getting on the ball trying to make things happen but failing to do so. Inventive but lacking a final product. Angel di Maria - 6 . This sort of performance is simply not acceptable for a player who cost them the best part of £60million; quiet, a few nice crosses and the odd shot, not value for money. Radamel Falcao - 5.5 . Had a quiet first half and did not provide the movement up front to cause West Ham any real problems. He got behind West Ham’s defence for a split second in the second half but missed. James Tomkins keeps Falcao at bay bu jumping above the Manchester United forward . Robin van Persie - 6 . Lucky to escape with just a talking to from referee Mark Clattenburg when's flailing arm caught James Tomkins and knocked him down. Great chance to score early in the second chance. Subs . Marouane Fellaini (Adnan Januzaj 72) -  6 . Louis van Gaal . Played too many players out of their strongest position and only one out-right midfielder in Daley Blind. It meant the team’s organisation was all over the place. Escaped with the draw.","Cheikhou Kouyate's opener was cancelled out by Daley Blind .

"The family of a middle-aged woman found dead at a £1.6million mansion today described the murder victim as 'a free spirit who enjoyed her life'.

Mr . Mears had lunch with Miss Graves's mother, sister Janet and . brother-in-law Nigel Acres last Thursday, and was shocked to hear of her . death just a few days later. 'I eventually spoke to Nigel on New Year's Day,' he added. 'He told me the detectives had taken their mobiles and things away.' It emerged last night that police are investigating an advert on a well-known sex website, which suggests the property, located in a village that once featured in ITV crime drama Midsomer Murders, could be used as a venue for ‘casual sex’ and a ‘discreet relationship’.

There is no suggestion that any of the occupants of the house at the time of the murder were aware of its past. Meanwhile, Miss Graves’s ex-boyfriend was interviewed yesterday by detectives. Former . rock band roadie Roy Wood – the father of her two grown-up children – . was questioned for several hours but not arrested or cautioned. On guard: A police car stationed outside the £1.6million mansion in Bosham today . Police are investigating an advert on a well-known sex website, which suggests that the property in Bosham, West Sussex, could have been used as a venue for 'casual sex' and a 'discreet relationship' The . 65-year-old lives on the outskirts of Brighton, 30 miles from the . murder scene in the picturesque village of Bosham. Miss . Graves was found dead with a ‘significant’ head injury on Monday. She . is understood to have been house-sitting with family members and friends . at the cream-coloured property over the festive period. Police said they could not rule out the possibility that the murderer broke in, but they have ‘strong suspicions’ that Miss Graves was killed by someone she knew. The . waterside home, which has its own pool house and a jetty, is owned by . 66-year-old millionaire entrepreneur and company director Malcolm . Chamberlain and his wife Caroline, 63. It . is on the outskirts of Bosham where many properties are second homes . owned by the wealthy elite, including an Oscar-winning actress and rock . legend. Roadie: Mr Wood has worked with well-known artists including Donovan and Steve Harley . Musician: He is also a guitarist in his own band, and is currently writing a memoir about life on the road . Neighbours said the owners had travelled overseas with their twin children to spend Christmas at a holiday home owned by a family member. Miss Graves’ fellow house-sitters are thought to have included her sister Janet, 60, who lives in Weybridge, Surrey. Janet’s partner Nigel Acres, a 59-year-old architect, is an old friend of Mr Chamberlain, who has business interests in property. The couple bought their home in Weybridge from the Chamberlains. The murdered artist – who specialised in making toy hares from fibres – had recently moved to the South Coast from the Scottish borders, where she ran a craft business, to care for her ailing 87-year-old mother Eileen. Her ex-boyfriend, Mr Wood, is originally from the East London/Essex borders, and attended school in Barking. Investigation: Police were seen searching nearby streams . A Sussex Police team searches around a tree in the garden of the property . Some boats stored near the property. The area is popular with with leisure yachting enthusiasts and tourists . He then had a successful career as a sound engineer, touring Europe with artists including Donovan, and Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel. Mr Wood lives with his new partner Saskia Wesnick and their daughter Julia, 19, and is writing memoirs of his wild years on the road, while running the Sussex Diving Club. A keen Facebook user, he also uses the pseudonym Roy Weard, and uses the site to advertise the band he currently plays guitar with, Wooden Lion. In a striking series of photographs on the Net, Mr Wood is seen apparently dressed as the 1920s cinema vampire Nosferatu, as he poses among gravestones. In recent days he has posted images from beauty spots around East Sussex, and made no mention of Miss Graves. Last April however he did refer to his former partner ‘Val’ as he posted a copy of a song he had written about a man jilting his lover, complete with illustrations by Miss Graves. Evidently still in touch with her, he said: ‘she was and still is a talented artist’. The waterside home, which has its own pool house and a jetty, is owned by 66-year-old millionaire entrepreneur and company director Malcolm Chamberlain and his wife Caroline, 63 . Victim: The 55-year-old woman was found in this mansion on Monday with a severe head injury . A friend of Miss Graves’s mother, Ernie Mears, described the murdered woman as friendly and loving. The retired builder, 80, said: ‘I can’t believe what has happened. I was at the house on Boxing Day. ‘Nigel always cooks and we sat down to a wonderful meal with cold turkey, then they gave me my Christmas presents. 'It was Nigel, Jan, myself and Eileen that day. They treat me like one of the family. Valerie’s murder came as a great shock to me. I cannot make out how Valerie has come to harm because Nigel would be there to protect them. I found her to be a lovely chatty lady, who was dedicated to her children and family.’ Property owner Mr Chamberlain – who describes himself online as an ‘entrepreneur and investor’ – has enjoyed a string of directorships during an apparently successful career in business. One of three brothers, he is a director, with his wife, of an electronic component manufacturing company. On his LinkedIn profile, he uses the Latin motto ‘Aut inveniam viam aut faciam’, which means ‘I shall either find a way or make one’. The murder has rocked the sleepy village of Bosham, which sits on a small peninsula between two tidal creeks. The wealthy enclave, at the eastern end of Chichester harbour, has an extremely low  crime rate, with no burglaries recorded for the last two months. Bosham was used to film a scene of Midsomer Murders titled Written in Blood. Officers continued to comb the sprawling murder scene for clues yesterday as a police launch was used to tow away a 14ft motor boat. A post mortem found Miss Graves died from significant head and facial injuries.","Valerie Graves, 55, was apparently bludgeoned to death while house-sitting .

"Yaya Toure says Manchester City can still win the Premier League title if they win all their remaining fixtures as he branded criticism of him ‘b******’.

"Jamie Carragher believes Manchester United will not make Radamel Falcao's move permanent at the end of the season and questioned the effectiveness of his strike partnership with Robin van Persie after Sunday's 1-1 draw with West Ham. Louis van Gaal's side had defensive midfielder Daley Blind to thank after his 93rd minute equaliser earned a point against The Hammers in an encounter where  Van Persie and  Falcao stuttered throughout. And Carragher feels United's woes stem from the array of attacking players manager Van Gaal spent millions on accumulating after taking the reigns at Old Trafford last year. Radamel Falcao (centre) struggled to impress for Manchester United against West Ham . Robin van Persie (centre) partnered Falcao (second right) in attack in the game for United . Jamie Carragher believes that United will not sign for United on a permanent contract . 'I don't see Falcao staying, it's something they have to address,' Carragher said on Sky Sports after the game. 'I can't believe (James) Wilson didn't come on at some stage of the game. Falcao and Van Persie lack movement and I don't think this is a partnership that's working. 'Everyone talks about United and that they need a centre-back - they have one of the best defensive records in the league, although (David) De Gea is part of that, but that's the reason you pay him. 'The problems are at the other end of the pitch.' Carragher's co-pundit, ex Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke, is undecided on whether he thinks Falcao should remain beyond this season. 'The jury is still out on Falcao,' Yorke explained. 'He had a great opportunity today but it hasn’t materialised at this point of time, maybe the system is the issue and not the actual players.' Former United strike Dwight Yorke is undecided on whether he thinks Falcao should stay . Louis van Gaal (right) shakes the hand of his goalscorer Daley Blind (left) Blind (left) celebrates his 93rd minute goal for United alongside Marouane Fellaini (right) Former Liverpool defender Carragher also queried Van Gaal's decision to drop captain Wayne Rooney into midfield - away from his traditional role in attack. 'Rooney's position is not right, he was playing as a defensive midfield player,' Carragher said. 'Why is he (Van Gaal) not putting Rooney up off the front, with two strikers showing such a lack of movement? They had less touches today than De Gea.' United fell behind to West Ham after Cheikhou Kouyate's brilliant finish four minutes into the second half. But Van Gaal rolled the dice by throwing on Marouane Fellaini on 72 as his side turned to a long ball style and in the dying moments, Blind volleyed in Angel Di Maria's cross. Carragher commended the character in United's team and Van Gaal's decision to ditch his regular possession style and go direct in search of a goal. 'It's not luck,' Carragher insisted. 'United have done it too often over the years. They've done it again today. How many times have we seen United and they haven't played well and they've still got a result? United captain Wayne Rooney (right)  struggled to ignite his team's play at Upton Park from midfield . David de Gea made a number of fine saves before West Ham opened the scoring in the 49th minute . 'He put Fellaini on and went long. In the past United wouldn't have done that but I admire that. You talk about principles, sometimes you have to change them when it's not working and credit to Van Gaal, he did.' Carragher later queried what United's best formation is on his Kicca account. 'United are notorious for playing wingers & in Januzai, Valencia, Young & Di Maria they have players who can fill those roles but, when a foreign manager comes in especially he will have his own ideas rather than adhere to the club's traditions,' Carragher wrote. 'That's something they may have to get used to now & in the future.'","Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie struggled against West Ham .

"Paris Saint Germain's tenacity paid off as the defending champions earned a deserved 1-1 draw at French league leaders Lyon on Sunday, after Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a penalty at the second time of asking. Sweden striker Ibrahimovic  equalised in the 69th minute having seen in his initial attempt kept out by Anthony Lopes. But Ibrahimovic was given the opportunity to redeem himself after the referee penalised Lyon's players for running into the area before he had taken his kick, and the striker lashed his second attempt into the top corner as Lopes dived the opposite way.

Lyon's players remonstrate with Turpin (second right) as Ibrahimovic (second left) celebrates . PSG created the best chances but struggled with efficiency in front of goal as Lopes made several outstanding saves. The result left Lyon two points above Marseille and PSG. Knowing that a victory would lift them to the top of standings, PSG started at a quick pace although the hosts created the first big chance in the 11th minute when Corentin Tolisso fired from 25 meters but saw his drive rattle PSG keeper Salvatore Sirigu's right post. PSG responded immediately after Maxime Gonalons gave the ball away to Ibrahimovic in his own half. With no space in front of him, the Sweden striker passed the ball to Edinson Cavani who lost his duel with Lopes. PSG's best chance of the first half came 10 minutes later from a corner that defender David Luiz headed wide from close range after Cavani flicked it on at the near post. While the visitors lacked a cutting edge, Cameroon striker Clinton N'Jie put Lyon ahead with a clinical finish from six yards from Nabil Fekir's pass in the 31st minute.

"An Adelaide convenience store worker who asked for a photo with Dennis Rodman was stunned when the former basketball star's manager demanded he first buy them two packs of Berocca. Umar Chaudhary, 35, was working at the It's Convenient! store on Waymouth St in the CBD on Sunday when he recognised the controversial 53-year-old, who is in Australia for his Bad Boy speaking tour. 'He walked in and I could tell that it's him because he's very tall,' Mr Chaudhary told Daily Mail Australia. Adelaide convenience store worker Umar Chaudhary (left) met Dennis Rodman (right) while at work on Sunday . Mr Chaudhary was stunned when the former basketball star's manager demanded he buy them two packs of Berocca in exchange for a photo . 'He was with his manager, or somebody like that, and they walked down the aisle and picked up a lot of Berocca. 'I went up to them and I asked ""Hey are you Dennis Rodman?"" and he said ""Yeah I'm the man.""' Mr Chaudhary then asked if he could have a picture taken with Rodman, who is known for his bizarre behaviour including his close friendship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Rodman's manager interjected and according to Mr Chaudhary said he could take a photo 'Only if you can pay for the Beroccas in his hand.' Mr Chaudhary said he was 'taken aback' but said OK because he thought it was a joke. Rodman and his manager kept shopping and came up to the counter with the vitamin tablets and other items including Powerade, protein bars and condoms. The controversial 53-year-old is touring around Australia as part of his Bad Boy speaking tour . Mr Chaudhary, who works at the store two days per week while he completes his masters in accounting, said the experience was strange but he had no hard feelings . 'I scanned the Berocca normally with the rest of his groceries but the manager stopped me and said ""Hey, but you said you were going to pay for these from your pocket."" 'So I took $40 out from my pocket, showed him the money and printed out receipt to show him and asked ""Are you happy?"" and he said ""Yeah, I'm happy"". 'I was actually at the point where the picture didn't mean much to me, it kind of had lost its value.' The former NBA star posed for a photo and asked Mr Chaudhary if he owned the convenience store or was just an employee. 'I told him I'm an employee,' he said. Mr Chaudhary said he was 'taken aback' but said OK because he thought it was a joke . Rodman and his manager bought the vitamin tablets and other items including Powerade and condoms . 'The whole time I thought he was going refund the money and say ""I'm just joking"" but they walked out.' Mr Chaudhary, who works at the store two days per week while he completes his masters in accounting, said the experience was strange but he had no hard feelings. 'I told him ""At least you'll remember this guy who paid for the Beroccas"",' he said. 'I don't care much about it, it's just 40 bucks. 'Sometimes people do weird things, I won't hold it against him.' Rodman is currently touring around Australia for his 'raw and uncensored' speaking tour.

"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has said he believes the owner of the Washington Redskins would consider changing the team's name because it causes offence to Native Americans. Goodell joined the debate on Sunday during a question-and-answer session with Dallas season ticket-holders before the Cowboys' game against the Redskins. The commissioner said he grew up in Washington and considered everything about the name to be something that honored the tradition of Native Americans. Change: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he believes Washington owner Daniel Snyder is 'way down the road' in consideration of name change . 'But I think we also have to be sensitive enough to at least listen and try to see what it is we can do if we're insulting any element of our fan base, or non-fan base for that matter,' Goodell said. 'I think Dan Snyder is way down the road on doing that. I'm confident he's listening. I'm confident he feels strongly about the name but also wants to do the right thing.' The Redskins were playing for the first time since President Barack Obama reignited the debate by saying he would 'think about changing' the name if he were the team's owner. He said: 'The name is just simply inappropriate. It is offensive to a lot of people.' Debate: Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo (9) lines up behind center Travis Frederick (72) during the second half of an NFL football game against the Washington Redskins Sunday . Debate: Zena 'Chief Z' Williams signs autographs. President Barack Obama said that if he owned the Washington Redskins, he would 'think about changing' the team name . Congressman Tom Cole - a Republican - has called it 'offensive.' The Oneida Indian Nation, which ran a radio advertisement in Dallas to protest the . name, is also planning to meet with NFL representatives over the . issue. A small group of protesters gathered . near the stadium hours before kickoff carrying signs that read 'Stop . Perpetuating Racism' and 'Redskins (equals) 81 years racism.' Pro change: Ray Halbritter, a senior leader of the Oneida Indian Nation in New York state, speaks at a symposium in Washington, DC in favor of changing the name . Support: A Washington Redskins fan shows his support for re-branding the US capital's beloved American football team . 'I'm . glad the president took a stand,' said Yolanda Blue Horse, of Dallas, a . member of the Lakota Nation. 'If Dan Snyder wanted to honor Native . Americans there's better ways to do that rather than Redskins.' One . of the protesters, Juan Mancias, drove from his home in the San Antonio . area with flag of the American Indian Movement, which began in 1968. He said he protested at a Cowboys and Redskins game at Texas Stadium in 1997. Jack Flack, a Redskins fan from Washington who attended the game with friends, said he would change the name to Washington Senators. 'I mean, if the president's weighing in, it's probably time for change,' Flack said. However, some Cowboys fans saw no reason for change. 'It's a tradition,' said Stephanie Smith of Houston. 'It's how it should be.' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones backed Snyder during the session with Goodell. 'It would be a real mistake to think that Dan ... in any way has a lack of sensitivity regarding somebody's feelings,' Jones said. 'I can promise you that.' It was adopted by the football team in 1933 when co-owner George Preston Marshall renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins, and the name followed the team to Washington. Many U.S. sports teams were named after indigenous peoples but in recent years the names have proved more offensive.","NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell joined the debate on Sunday .

"West Ham have sold the Boleyn Ground, their home for 110 years, to developers Galliard, paving the way for their move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016. Plans for the site, called ‘East End Village’, include 700 homes. Fans and residents are expected to vote on naming apartment blocks after West Ham legends such as Bobby Moore, Trevor Brooking, Geoff Hurst and Billy Bonds. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Kevin Nolan and Mark Noble visiting the Olympic stadium . All change: West Ham's famous Upton Park ground has been sold to be turned into 700 flats . Local lad: West Ham star Joe Cole poses for photographers at the Olympic Stadium last year as work continues to turn the arena into West Ham's new home . The site will also feature a claret-and-blue theme to reflect West Ham’s colours. It is understood the purchase price fell short of the £71.2million the stadium is valued at in club accounts. No financial details have been disclosed but a report in the London Evening Standard suggests that the club will raise less than the £71.2 million the 35,016 all-seater stadium is valued at in its accounts. Once . the site has been fully developed experts expect it to eventually be . worth hundreds of millions of pounds with the apartments expected to . prove attractive to fans, investors and other buyers desperate to get a . foothold in the London property market. Blocks of apartments will be built . around central public gardens where the pitch is currently laid, . following the example set by Arsenal’s former Highbury stadium home in . Islington, north London. A statement on the club's website . read: 'West Ham United can confirm that Award-Winning local London . developer Galliard Group has reached an agreement to purchase the Boleyn . Ground Football Stadium once the club completes its move to the Olympic . Stadium in 2016. 'Following a competitive bidding . process, West Ham United selected Galliard Group as the purchaser for . the site ahead of a number of other national and international . companies.

Ground as part of their proposed development.' Away blaze: West Ham captain  Kevin Nolan (left) wheels away after scoring his and the Hammers' second in the 2-0 win at Aston Villa . The first match to be played at the iconic Boleyn Ground was against Millwall in 1904. West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady added: 'We . opted to reach an agreement with Galliard because they are a local . London developer and employer with origins in east London. We know they . are committed to working closely with the local community and Newham . Council on proposals to transform the site into a residential and retail . village, which will benefit the local community and east London's . regional economy. 'The . deal demonstrates that we have been true to our word by securing the . regeneration of two areas of east London through our move to the Olympic . Stadium in 2016. 'In . addition, and most importantly for us, we can see that Galliard are . passionate about working with West Ham United to engage their supporters . to help deliver a fitting legacy that will honour the tradition of the . famous ground. We are confident that West Ham United fans will be . excited about their vision and the way they plan to respect more than . 100 years of West Ham history at Upton Park.' Stephen .

Galliard Group is . committed to an open and wide ranging consultation on its plans for the . iconic site, including full engagement with Newham Council, as the . relevant planning authority, as well as with local residents and . businesses. Sir Robin . Wales, Mayor of Newham, said: 'We have always maintained that West Ham . United's relocation to Stratford had the potential to deliver an Olympic . Legacy beyond Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park as a key part of the . comprehensive regeneration of Green Street and Upton Park. The prospect . of much needed homes, jobs and community spaces for this area is an . exciting one.' Galliard's . proposals seek to provide new homes and both complementary and . innovative ground floor retail and leisure facilities, complete with . underground parking. Galliard also plan to undertake discussions with . the family of Bobby Moore regarding the proposed development of a . beautiful central landscaped garden, which would be named the Bobby . Moore Memorial Garden, providing a fitting tribute to the legacy of West . Ham United at the iconic site. Under . proposals also being considered, fans and local residents would be . invited to enter a poll to name each building after a legendary player . or an historic event at the club.

Siegelman, to create a statue of Bobby Moore and other artwork . celebrating the heritage of the football club, which would be located in . the gardens and grounds of the new village. Under the plans, the . current West Ham memorial garden by the front entrance to the grounds . would also be retained, protected and incorporated into the new . development. Bobby Moore's . daughter, Roberta Moore, is pleased that there will be a lasting tribute . to West Ham United on Green Street. She said: 'I have always believed . that there should be some form of permanent West Ham United presence at . the Boleyn Ground site after the team leave and I'm really pleased that . the centre point of the development is planned to be named in honour of . my father. 'Hopefully . the new sculptures and buildings being proposed will also help ensure . that a lasting legacy to the club, my father and his team-mates is left . at Upton Park.' The new village, which will have a construction programme of some 30 months, has an anticipated completion date of late 2018. What will be at the site to commemorate West Ham's history?We were impressed with Galliard Group's commitment to honouring the legacy of West Ham United at the site. They have plans to name the key buildings at the new site after West Ham United legends, decided through polls and competitions with fans and the local community.Subject to approval and consultation, they also plan to name the central area of the development after West Ham legend Bobby Moore and will be looking to create sculptures and works of art to remember famous players and moments from West Ham's history. These will all be created in conjunction with the players' families and fans. What will happen to the remembrance garden?One of the most important aspects for West Ham in the negotiations with potential partners was the plans for the Memorial Gardens. We are pleased that Galliard Group plan to leave the Memorial Garden as it is so relatives and friends of loved ones can continue to come and pay their respects at the site. Will the commemorative bricks be coming?Yes. All of the names and messages on the commemorative bricks currently in place at the Boleyn Ground will be transferred to the Olympic Stadium. The Club also have plans to offer fans the chance to place new bricks at West Ham's new home. What else will be coming with West Ham to the Olympic Stadium?The Club are in discussions with the Supporter Advisory Board about what they want the Club to take to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Those discussions are ongoing but the key parts of the Club's history are likely to travel alongside items like the commemorative plaques for Club legends and the West Ham Pals Battalion from the First World War. Will local residents and traders be consulted?Yes, Galliard Group are renowned for their consultation with local residents. They pride themselves on their engagement with the local community and will hold regular meetings and distribute a regular newsletter to local residents and businesses.

"Brendan Rodgers never took his eyes off Jordon Ibe. In Liverpool’s final training session ahead of the Merseyside derby, the manager was about to make a big call and wanted to gauge the reaction. ‘He only found out he was playing on Friday,’ said Rodgers. ‘I was looking at him when I announced it.’ Ibe never flinched. The forward, signed from Wycombe in December 2011, has continually impressed Rodgers but he wanted to see how the 19-year-old would fare in his biggest test. Brendan Rodgers had no hesitation to throw Jordon Ibe in his Liverpool starting line-up against Everton . Ibe (middle) was outstanding for Liverpool in the Merseyside derby against Everton . The Liverpool youngster robs Steven Naismith of the ball during the Premier League clash . He didn’t disappoint. If the 192nd collision in the league between these clubs was instantly forgettable at least Ibe, with his fearless running and boundless enthusiasm on his second Barclays Premier League start, left Rodgers purring about the future. Loan spells at Birmingham last season and Derby in the first half of this campaign gave the England Under 20 international a valuable education but Rodgers recalled Ibe at the start of January knowing he could contribute to Liverpool’s push for a top-four spot. John Stones and Phil Jagielka have played 90 minutes together 11 times this season. Everton are unbeaten in those games. Ibe might have settled this stalemate, as he hit the post from 25 yards. ‘Maybe I have too much belief in young players,’ said Rodgers. ‘But you never know until you throw them in.

"All of a sudden, Manchester City have gone from looking ahead to a title race to glancing nervously over their shoulders in the chase for a Champions League spot. The seven-point advantage that Chelsea have opened up over the Premier League champions is the same gap that now exists between City and Arsenal in sixth. Southampton lead the pack of clubs breathing down their necks. Hull midfielder David Meyler scored the opening goal of the game as they took an unlikely  1-0 lead at  City . James Milner scores the equaliser from a free-kick but it is not enough for Manchester City to earn a win . James Milner’s late equaliser ended his run of 36 league games without a goal. City have failed to win in their last five games, including home defeats by Arsenal in the league and Middlesbrough in the FA Cup. It represents their worst run since late 2009 when the ‘trajectory of results’ signalled the end for Mark Hughes, who will be relishing the opportunity to do the double over his old club when City visit Stoke on Wednesday night. Based on the fate of his predecessors, Manuel Pellegrini should be a worried man. City’s record after 24 games is almost identical to the post-title slump in 2012-13 when they trailed United by seven points at the same stage. Roberto Mancini finished that season empty-handed and paid for it with his job. There is no suggestion that Pellegrini is under threat just yet, and the Chilean has already pulled a rabbit out of the hat in the Champions League once this season. Manchester City's Vincent Kompany looks dejected as Hull pull off a shock at the Etihad Stadium . Kompany and Samir Nasri have words following the final whistle at the Etihad Stadium . The way things are shaping up, City’s two encounters with Barcelona could have a decisive impact on Pellegrini’s future. After snatching a late point against struggling Hull City, Samir Nasri is not alone in believing that City are running out of time to put things right. ‘We have to wake up and do the job now before it’s too late,’ said Nasri. ‘Chelsea, with no disrespect, are not Liverpool who can drop points. They are really solid. ‘We have to catch them as soon as possible if we want to be champions. But at the same time we have to look behind us. Southampton have won, United are getting close. Manager Manuel Pellegrini accepted his team were lacking in ideas during their game against Hull . ‘It will be tough at Stoke. It’s not ideal on a Wednesday night during the winter, but we have to win it.’ City will not be able to call on Yaya Toure or new £28million striker Wilfried Bony at the Britannia Stadium, with the two Ivory Coast internationals not expected back from Equatorial Guinea until Tuesday after playing in the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday night. On Saturday, James Milner scored with a 92nd-minute free-kick to deny Hull after David Meyler had given the relegation strugglers a deserved, if scrappy, lead. Talks over a new contract for Milner remain deadlocked but Pellegrini says he is confident the England midfielder can be persuaded to stay beyond this season.","Manchester City needed a last-gasp equaliser to draw with Hull .

"Charlie Austin has given QPR a huge lift as it emerged that he will miss only one game after scans showed he has escaped with severe bruising on his injured right foot. There had been fears that Austin, who has scored 13 Premier League goals, would be out for the season after leaving Loftus Road in a protective boot on Saturday. The Rangers forward will miss the trip to Sunderland on Tuesday but he is expected to return against Hull City on February 22. Charlie Austin's (left) injury to his foot is not as bad as first feared and he will only miss one game for QPR . Scans revealed on Sunday that Austin had not broken his foot as first feared . However, Rangers are likely to be mising Richard Dunne for the rest of the season with a knee injury . Rangers will be without central defender Richard Dunne for the rest of the season after he damaged medial ligaments in his right knee during Saturday’s loss to Southampton. Seven of the past 10 meetings between these two sides have resulted in away wins. Dunne was forced off with the injury in the 83rd minute against Ronald Koeman’s side and scans confirmed on Sunday that he will need an operation. Nedum Onuoha, who played as a makeshift right back against high-flying Saints, is another injury concern after damaging his hamstring. Coaches Chris Ramsey and Kevin Bond will prepare the team for Tuesday’s trip to the Stadium of Light, but Tim Sherwood is still expected to be named QPR manager. QPR joint caretaker manager Chris Ramsey (second left) and Kevin Bond (far left) will take charge of QPR for the trip to Sunderland on Tuesday night . Sadio Mane celebrates after scoring a last-gasp winner for Southampton at Loftus Road on Saturday . The former Spurs boss has been out of work since he was sacked by Daniel Levy last May and he faces a massive challenge to keep Rangers in the Premier League. Ramsey, who worked with Sherwood at Spurs, admitted the pair talk most days, but continues to insist that they have yet to discuss the size of the task at Loftus Road. The QPR coach said: ‘I’ll be speaking to him, but we’ll talk about football and loads of other things. We’ll probably have a chat about the game, but it’s no different from other people having a chat about the game.’ Former manager Harry Redknapp thinks Sherwood will get the job. ‘There’s every chance,’ he said. ‘It’s pretty much set up for Tim.’ Rangers are in desperate trouble after five successive defeats and it will take some re-organising to keep this team in the top flight. Following Harry Redknapp's resignation, Tim Sherwood has emerged as the front-runner for the QPR job . They were beaten when Saido Mane scored for Saints in the 93rd minute to keep their dream of finishing in the top four and qualifying for the Champions League alive. Saints manager Ronald Koeman said: ‘Last season it was Everton who were fighting for that position, now it looks like we will. ‘That’s good because it makes a change and it’s good for the rest of the clubs. ‘They have the best players and they buy the best, so it’s difficult, but we have to fight to the end of the season. That’s the challenge.’","QPR suffered a last-gasp defeat against Southampton on Saturday .

"Sam Allardyce branded Louis van Gaal’s side ‘Long-ball United’ after West Ham were denied victory by a late goal. Daley Blind snatched a point in second-half stoppage time after Manchester United resorted to pumping long balls up the pitch and into West Ham’s penalty area. They were trailing to Cheikhou Kouyate’s strike until right at the death when Carl Jenkinson misguided a headed clearance into Blind’s path. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce took a swipe at his opponents Manchester United for 'long ball' tactics . Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal congratulates Daley Blind after his late equaliser at Upton Park . West Ham manager Allardyce said: ’In the end we couldn’t cope with Long-ball United. It's not how you normally see United play, but it got them a goal in the end. ‘You might just criticise Louis Van Gaal for playing long balls as much as I’m sometimes criticised for being direct. In the end it’s paid off for them so you can’t knock it.’ Despite the draw, Allardyce was proud of his side’s resolute display: ‘It was a terrific performance from all who took part, they excited the crowd but with the quality Manchester United have you know they will be a threat. They were a bit fortunate but it was a great finish from Blind. ‘We were good at getting the ball quickly to our front two. The chances we had, the trouble we caused them. Blocking off Falcao, RVP, Rooney, Di Maria, barely got a look in until the end,’ added Allardyce. Blind runs away in celebration having rescued a point for Manchester United at Upton Park on Sunday . ‘Restricting Man United to such little and stifling them going forward was fantastic and I thought we deserved a 2-0 nil lead but sadly we couldn’t grab a famous victory.' The Manchester United boss even admitted afterwards that it has been his Plan B in games this season to get Marouane Fellaini on the pitch and pump passes up to him. The towering forward was thrown on with 18 minutes remaining. ‘I have done that already a lot of times with Fellaini so that is not new,’ Van Gaal revealed. ‘I think also West ham should know that. Cheikhou Kouyate fires West Ham ahead on 49 minutes with this fine volley for the hosts at Upton Park . ‘With him we have more power. With Adnan Januzaj and Angel Di Maria, we have more creative players. That's why the second ball you cannot always win, with these players. 'But you have to win, otherwise I have to line-up always players like Fellaini.’ Van Gaal ripped into his side’s lacklustre opening 45 performance: ‘I think we played very bad in the first-half but showed a lot of resilience in the second-half. Van Gaal watches on from the Manchester United bench, accusing his side of lacking guts in the first-half . ‘We need the guts to play football along the floor. We didn’t in the first-half. We did in the second. ‘After the goal, then we finally played football but you have to do that from the start. But I must say what spirit from my team.’ Luke Shaw was sent off late on for a second bookable offence when he scythed down Stewart Downing. But van Gaal disagreed with referee Mike Clattenburg’s decision, adding: ‘He doesn't touch him. It was in front of me. The player was jumping, but I think it was tactically not so smart of Shaw.’","West Ham drew 1-1 with Manchester United at Upton Park .

"Having started at the top of the diamond, Angel di Maria finished the game on the left wing. In truth, his contributions were limited in both positions but the tactical switch brought the consolation of a quick exit. Di Maria was well placed to dart straight down the tunnel, with a dark look on his face which failed to reflect the relief that Manchester United had rescued a late point from a game they seemed set to lose. He was almost off the pitch when he twisted his upper body towards the United fans in a distant corner of the ground and offered them some over-the-shoulder applause, but he did not allow the after-thought to interrupt his stride. Angel di Maria (left) struggled to make an impact as Manchester United nicked a draw at West Ham . Di Maria had a difficult afternoon, and not a lot went right for the Argentine playmaker . English football’s most expensive signing could not get off fast enough. Mind you, he wasn’t alone. Only Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Daley Blind and Phil Jones took the trouble to trudge over to the supporters. Again, not a lot had gone right for Di Maria during 90 minutes best summed up by one moment, 13 minutes into the second half when Blind, searching for a long pass to the United right, crashed the ball into the £60million Argentine, who was just a yard or two away. It was not Blind’s most stylish offering and he shrugged an apology as he digested the contents of a filthy glare from Di Maria, who could have done without another pain in the backside. It had not been a good few days. Perhaps the horror of the robbery at his home was still playing tricks on his mind. It has not been a great first campaign in English football. Eight months have ticked by since he was the man of the match in Real Madrid’s Champions League final success. Louis van Gaal played a diamond formation against West Ham, but some players struggled with the style . Radamel Falcao proved to be ineffective, and squandered a chance to get on the scoresheet at Upton Park . He has not played in the competition since, and might start to wonder if he will be back in it next season. United are fighting in the pack behind Chelsea and Manchester City. It is going to be close if they continue to follow each sign of progress with a backward step. Di Maria is finding it difficult to influence games as he did when he first arrived from Real Madrid. It is four months since his last goal in the Barclays Premier League, although he got one at Yeovil in the FA Cup. At West Ham, flashes of promise were swallowed up by the peculiarities of Louis van Gaal’s system, seemingly designed to cram as many creative players as possible into the team, but rarely in their preferred positions. They lacked pace, width and aggression and were easily neutralised by the midfield endeavour of Mark Noble and the defensive strength of James Tomkins and Cheikhou Kouyate. Falcao (right) knocks the ball past Adrian in the West Ham goal, but it goes wide of the post . Di Maria (left) makes a pass under pressure from West Ham midfielder Alex Song at Upton Park on Sunday . Di Maria’s most significant offerings were a fierce drive into the arms of Adrian in the first half, and a free-kick whipped over the bar in the second. In open play, he struggled in a side where the attackers are playing without fluency. While David de Gea made saves and Jones defended well, no one dazzled in Van Gaal’s front five until the introduction of Marouane Fellaini added some useful muscle. Radamel Falcao and Van Persie were both guilty of missing clear chances as United searched for the equaliser. Like Di Maria, Adnan Januzaj and Rooney seemed lost on the edges of the diamond. Rooney operated in areas of the pitch where he had little positive impact on proceedings, having defended poorly on Kouyate’s opener. Rooney memorably scored from halfway at Upton Park last season. This time United can cherish their point and little else by way of satisfaction.","Angel di Maria started at the top of Louis van Gaal's diamond formation .

"Another entry in Jermain Defoe’s little book, another dilemma for Gus Poyet. How do you rest a man who, on current form, will comfortably keep Sunderland in the Premier League? That was the question niggling at Poyet this weekend, barely a week after admitting he did not enjoy watching his side play. That he spent much of Saturday wearing a huge grin says everything about the impact of a striker who has scored twice in three league games. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet (right) is delighted with the impact of striker Jermain Defoe . Defoe (third right) scored for Sunderland in their 1-1 draw against Swansea in the Premier League . Defoe (right) celebrates with his Sunderland team-mates after scoring his second Sunderland goal . Swansea have not lost against a side from the bottom half of the table this season. The latest of those, a delightful strike against Swansea, means he is the only striker to have scored against all 20 clubs in the Premier League. Trivial, maybe, but goals are what Sunderland have lacked and they keep Defoe interested. ‘Things like that are always special to me,’ Defoe said. ‘I keep a note of things I’ve done, a little incentive. ‘I just write down lists — sometimes it’s things I’ve done, sometimes it’s things I want to do. It hasn’t been much of a surprise. When you’ve spent your whole career in the Premier League it should not take you too long to get back into the swing of things.’ To that end, Poyet is hoping for 10 goals from the 32-year-old. Poyet said: ‘It was a perfect deal, signing Jermain. Sometimes things happen for a reason and I hope it was that we deserved to get a player like Jermain. If he gets 10 goals we’re going to finish in a very nice place.’ Ki Sung-Yueng (centre) scored Swansea's goal as the match against Sunderland was drawn . Poyet believes that he cannot afford to give Defoe a rest while he keeps on finding the back of the net . The dilemma comes from knowing Defoe, whose opener on Saturday was cancelled out by Ki Sung-Yueng, must be handed a break at some point. Poyet said: ‘When someone scores goals you cannot drop him. He’s going to have to die on the pitch.’","Jermain Defoe has scored twice in his first three Sunderland games .
