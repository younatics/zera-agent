"A low-paid African immigrant to France has been sent to prison for 'insulting' the billionaire Prince and Princess of Monaco (pictured) A low-paid African immigrant to France has been sent to prison for 'insulting' the billionaire Prince and Princess of Monaco. In a case which has sparked a debate about the power of modern European royalty, the 28-year-old Tunisian was locked up late last month. Details of the 'crime' have been hushed up by the authorities in the notoriously secret Mediterranean principality, but the unnamed defendant pleaded not guilty. Despite this, he was placed in handcuffs and sentenced to three months in jail on September 23, with Monaco judges handing down a stiffer sentence than prosecutors had asked for. A week before he had been in a court room annex looking for officers who deal with employment tribunals concerning accidents at work. There he is said to have started 'shouting ferociously' at staff, before allegedly saying some 'very unpleasant things' about Prince Albert, 56, and his pregnant wife, Charlene, 36. These 'vulgar insults' are against the law in the tax haven, and were overheard by a bailiff, who reported them to the police. 'The judges took the case very seriously,' said a source close to the case. 'Prosecutors wanted a fine and a week in jail maximum, but he got a full three months. 'He denies that anything serious happened, and says it was all just a misunderstanding, but still ended up in prison'. Scroll down for video . In 2008 a French court convicted a member of the public for offending Nicolas Sarkozy, France's then head of state, but he was not sent to prison. Prince Albert II of Monaco and Princess Charlene arrive to attend the 66th annual Red Cross Gala in August . Herve Eon had held up a sign to Sarkozy's face reading: 'Get lost you sad idiot', but was fined the equivalent of just £25. Even then, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2013 that France had been wrong to convict Mr Eon. A Monaco resident who asked not to be named for legal reasons said: 'This case sums up how people with vast inherited wealth are still treated like medieval lords. 'It is absolutely disgraceful that a poor immigrant should go to prison for insulting royalty - anybody should be allowed to speak about royalty in negative terms in this day and age.'","African immigrant imprisoned for insulting the Prince and Princess .

"Questions have been raised over Australia's nutrition watchdog stance against the controversial Paleo diet, with supporters of the fad taking to social media to voice their outrage. Over the past few months, those who believe in the diet - including celebrity chef Pete Evans - have taken to Twitter to hit back at the Dietitians Association of Australia's (DAA) July criticism of the trend. In a statement, the association's chief executive officer Claire Hewat said the Paleo diet was 'potentially dangerous' and evidence of its benefits 'just doesn't stack up'. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Pete Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism . In September, the My Kitchen Rules judge took aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia . Her comments came just months before Pete Evans' 2,100-word rant on his Facebook page, which claimed the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism. Evans is known for his role as a judge on reality cooking series My Kitchen Rules. In the rant, he took aim at the Heart Foundation as well as DAA, questioning their motives behind their damning view of the Paleo diet. 'Why does the DAA and heart foundation have financial ties to Multi national (sic) food processed food corporations that litter the supermarket shelves with so called ""healthy foods""?' Evans wrote on his Facebook page. In the rant, Evans questioned DAA's motives as did other people on social media in the past few months . Evans was not the only one to take aim at the DAA for its stance on the Paleo diet . Natasha Lutrov - a Melbourne health blogger - also voiced her opinion on her blog on the issue . But he was not the only one who quizzed the DAA's partnership with Arnott’s, Nestle and Unilever - who own Streets ice cream. The Paleo diet requires people to cut out 'grains, legumes, certain dairy products, conventionally-raised meats, non-organic produce, and genetically modified and processed foods', which Ms Hewart says is not practical for many Australians. Ms Hewat said the diet was first suggested by researchers in 1985 to combat current-day chronic diseases that were a result of 'gene-culture mismatch' and humans' inability to adapt to diets beyond the Palaeolithic period. But she said this was not true and humans continued to develop. 'A recent search of the published studies looking at Palaeolithic diets revealed no more than ten studies, all with very few participants over very short timeframes – most less than three months,' she said. ‘We all eat, and so to a certain extent, we know what food makes us feel good. 'But rather than getting on the latest fad diet bandwagon, I urge Australians to become familiar with the dietary guidelines.' He took aim at the DAA's sponsors, hinting that their support may have sparked their stance on the paleo diet . But Pete Evans was not the only one to voice his concerns about the DAA's motives, news.com.au reported. Melbourne-based health blogger  Natasha Lutrov - who indulges in 'the paleo way' - also raised questions about the association's corporate sponsors. 'It's clear that DAA have vested interests and therefore this media release is an obvious public relations crisis management tactic,' she wrote on her blog. 'Why? The main message of the paleo diet is to ditch the processed foods and to eat food, which would have a detrimental affect on their major sponsors products like Campbell, Arnotts, Nestle and Unilever.' While Natascha Mirosch tweeted: 'The Dietitians Association of Australia is sponsored by Arnotts, Nestle & Kelloggs...Terrible'. Evans' September rant also made controversial claims about the diet's effect on autism. 'Why has our rate of autism jumped from 1 in 10000 children in 1974, to 1 in 50 in 2014, where do you think it will be in another 40 years if it is escalating at this rate? This has grown rapidly since the guidelines have been in place,' he wrote. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Dietitians Association of Australia for comment.","Questions have been raised over the influence sponsors have over Dietitians Association of Australia .

"David Cameron’s tax-cutting conference speech has helped push the Tories into their first national poll lead for two years, it emerged last night. After the PM pledged two major tax cuts covering 30million workers if the Tories are reelected, his party took a narrow one point lead in the polls. The Conservatives were on 35 per cent; Labour were on 34 per cent and Ukip on 14 per cent in the YouGov survey for The Sun and The Times. Scroll down for video . The Conservatives have taken the lead in the opinion polls, days after David Cameron's tax cutting speech at his party's conference . The poll is a vindication of the Tories’ tax-cutting strategy and a major blow to Ed Miliband following his disastrous party conference speech – in which he forgot to mention the deficit or immigration. It is the first time the Tories have had a lead in the polls since March 2012. The Lib Dems were on just 6 per cent, their equal lowest rating for more than a decade. It comes as a bitter blow to Deputy PM Nick Clegg on the eve of his party’s conference in Glasgow. Mr Cameron also posted a 21-point lead over Labour leader Ed Miliband on who would make the best Prime Minister – the biggest gap between the pair since February 2012. A total of 40 per cent preferred the Tory leader to be in charge, with just 19 per cent opting for the leader of the Opposition. Mr Cameron has also seen a boost in a range of personal characteristics after the annual Tory gathering ended on a triumphant note this week. On whether the PM is seen as strong, his rating is up 6 points to 46 per cent. On if he is decisive, he is up 3 points to 45 per cent. And even on his weakest point – on how much he is in touch with ordinary voters – he enjoyed a 7 point rise to 30 per cent. In a rousing address at the conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron said he modeled his speech on what most British families aspired to have . The poll presents a dramatic vindication of the Prime Minister’s £7billion pledge for families at the end of the conference. In a rousing address, he told delegates in Birmingham the next Conservative government would raise the 40p income tax threshold by more than £8,000 to £50,000 by 2020 – which would lift 800,000 people out of the higher tax band. The move will save £1,313 from the pockets of those who earn between £50,000 and £100,000. The Prime Minister also pledged to increase the personal allowance of 24million taxpayers. No tax is currently paid on £10,000 a year. That figure will gradually increase to £12,500 by 2020 if the Tories remain in office. Mr Cameron said that he had modelled his speech on what he believed most British families aspired to: ‘A good job, a nice home, more money at the end of the month, a decent education for your children and a safe and secure retirement’. Other vote-winning promises included a pledge to rein in the European Court of Human Rights by replacing Labour’s Human Rights Act with a bill of rights and promising to reform migration rules. Nick Clegg, who has been dealt a blow after it was revealed the Liberal Democrats are on their lowest rating in a decade . The Prime Minister said that Scottish MPs would be barred from voting on English laws once powers are devolved. Mr Cameron also vowed to crack down on youth unemployment and zero-hours contracts as well as provide 20 per cent discounts to first-time buyers of 100,000 new homes. The last time Labour trailed in the polls was shortly before Chancellor George Osborne’s so-called ‘omnishambles’ budget in 2012. At that time Mr Miliband attacked the decision to cut the 50p top rate of income tax and freeze personal allowances for pensioners. According to the poll, less than a fifth of current Ukip votes - 19 per cent - said the measures in Mr Cameron’s speech would make them better off overall, while 44 per cent said they would make no difference. YouGov surveyed 2,133 British adults between October 1 and 2.","Comes after David Cameron pledged major tax cuts for 30million workers .

"Jailed broadcaster Rolf Harris has been banned from painting behind bars because his oils pose a fire risk, it was claimed today. The disgraced entertainer is said to be in much demand from fellow inmates to sketch them at HMP Bullingdon, where he is serving a five-year, nine-month sentence. However, in place of his favourite oil paints, he has had to resort to pencils after prison bosses decided flammable oil paints were a risk to health and safety. Banned: Rolf Harris has been told he can't use his oil paints in jail because they are a risk to health and safety . Harris, 84, revealed the restrictions in conversation with visitors. A friend who visited Harris at the jail in Bicester, said that despite his conviction he was 'in good spirits.' The source knew Harris from his adopted hometown of Bray, Berkshire, but preferred not to be named. Harris, who is planning an appeal against his conviction, was said to be regularly asked by fellow inmates queuing outside his cell to capture their likeness. But without his oils, the best he can do for them is a quick pencil sketch. It hasn't all been fun and games for the former family favourite. Earlier reports have claimed he has lost a stone because he doesn't like the prison food and had become a 'hate figure' because of his paedophile crimes. The Australian entertainer was in June convicted of 12 indecent assaults on four girls as young as eight. Former family favourite: Harris, 84, who is planning an appeal against his conviction, is said to be regularly asked by fellow inmates queuing outside his cell to capture their likeness. In July, reports claimed that Harris was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service, an incident which was said to have sparked a mass brawl. More recently, he was accused by a fellow prisoner of 'jumping the queue' into a paid gardening job in the grounds of the Oxfordshire jail. Harris' frail wife Alwen is understood to also regularly visit her husband in Bullingdon prison, arriving in a wheelchair. She stood by Harris as he was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls during his trial at Southwark Crown Court. He was jailed for his decades preying on victims including and abusing his daughter's friend for 16 years. He even attacked her as his daughter slept in the same room. Disgraced: Harris was in June convicted of 12 indecent assaults on four girls as young as eight. He is pictured here with his daughter Bindi, right, and his wife Alwen, left, who is said to regularly visit him in jail . His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE. The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims. While refusing to discuss individual inmates such as Rolf Harris, a Prisons Department spokesman confirmed that inflammable substances like oil-based paints were not permitted in Britain's jails.","Disgraced entertainer is not allowed his oil paints behind bars .

"A coroner has warned of the ‘dire consequences’ of underage drinking after a boy aged 15 froze to death yards from his home. Leon Cudworth and his friends visited a pub, then bought bottles of vodka and other drinks and went on to a house party. After consuming large amounts of alcohol, they visited a bar. Leon was last seen at midnight, and CCTV shows him walking unsteadily near home at 1.20am. He was ‘delirious’ with cold and drink, and staggered past his house, an inquest heard. Leon Cudworth (pictured) was found dead on February 15, just yards from his home, after he is believed to have succumbed to hypothermia following a night out with pals . A neighbour woke to hear him shouting ‘Dad, Dad!’ and called police, but by the time two officers carried out a search, Leon was silent. At the inquest, it emerged one of the pair did not have a working torch. At 7.30am Leon, who had also smoked cannabis, was found lying on his back in an alley 35 yards from his front door. He had been wearing a flimsy jacket, a T-shirt, jeans and shoes in the near-freezing weather, and had suffered hypothermia. His back door key was next to his body. Assistant coroner Lisa Hashmi said: ‘The risks to both young people and adults alike in the misuse of drugs, and alcohol in particular, cannot be over-emphasised.’ She said she hoped ‘word will spread of the very dire consequences’ and that young people would ‘take heed of the tragic circumstances’. Floral tributes were left at the scene where Leon was found on February this year after telling his dad he was at a wine bar and ""wouldn't be long"" after speaking with him on the phone . The inquest in Heywood, Greater Manchester, heard Leon promised his father he would be back by midnight on the evening in February. He met friends aged 16,17 and 18 in a pub in Oldham, bought alcohol at a supermarket and an off-licence, and went to the house party. Leon and a friend moved on to a bar, where they were let in through rear doors. They then visited a McDonald’s, which Leon was seen leaving at midnight. Neighbours awoke to hear him screaming for his father in the street. Tracy Royal said: ‘He was shouting “Dad, Dad!”. At first I thought it was someone who had been locked out. ‘I did get up. He was crying and sounded tired. I got up again to have a look at about 2.40am . . . but I didn’t see anything. I thought he had got in the house. I felt awful because I could have phoned the police.’ The location where the schoolboy was found on the morning of February 15 this year, just yards from his home in Oldham, and a signed Manchester City football club shirt left at the scene . Another neighbour, Sarah Collins, called police and two officers searched the area. PC Steven Norris said he did not look more carefully as only one call was made. He revealed he did not have a working torch and added: ‘With hindsight we should have extended the search . . . At the time, I thought it was sufficient.’ PC Andrew Peters, who did have a torch, said that his search should have been more thorough. Pathologist Dr Philip Lumb gave the cause of death as hypothermia and acute alcohol intoxication. He said: ‘The cold can kill within minutes. Hypothermia causes confusion as well.’ Police have spoken to premises that sold alcohol to the friends. The assistant coroner returned a verdict of accidental death.

"A diagnosis of cancer is among the worst news anyone can receive. But hundreds of thousands of patients have considered not telling close friends and family about their diagnosis, new research shows. The main reason for keeping loved ones in the dark was to protect them worrying about the bad news. Up to a quarter of people diagnosed with cancer say they considered not telling friends and family they were ill (file picture) While women are generally known to be good communicators, the study found they were most likely to keep a diagnosis to themselves. Of those questioned, 25 per cent said they had considered not telling family, compared to just 18 per cent of men. The poll, commissioned for Bupa, also found there was a marked difference between not telling a spouse or partner about diagnosis, with 4 per cent of women considering it, compared to just 1 per cent of men. There are two million people in the UK living with or having survived cancer, according to the charity Macmillan. Nearly 20 per cent of adults polled knew someone who had decided not to tell a close family member or friend about their diagnosis. However over half said they would respect the person's decision to keep a diagnosis to themselves. But the rest admitted they would feel sad, disappointed  and shocked. The main reason for patients keeping the diagnosis secret was to enable to life to carry on as normal as possible - or to protect those closest to them. Half of people said it would to be avoid sympathy or special treatment, while a third simply wanted to manage and deal with it on their own. Jayne Molyneux, Cancer Healthcare Manager at Bupa, said: 'Every patient reacts differently to their cancer diagnosis. While women are generally known to be good communicators, the study found they were most likely to keep a diagnosis to themselves (file picture) 'We are finding more patients choosing to keep their diagnosis to themselves and dealing with treatment on their own, or until they have come to terms with it.' The cancer charity Macmillan explains some patients feel guilty, perhaps believing they have caused the cancer themselves in some way. It adds: 'However, in most cases it’s not clear what’s caused someone’s cancer. There is no reason to blame yourself. 'Although some of your family and friends may find it difficult to talk about your cancer, the best way to overcome this difficulty is often by talking. Even so, it’s not always easy telling family and friends about your illness.'

"Mourners wore flowers in their hair and donned bright, colourful clothing as they paid tribute today at the funeral of a British backpacker who was murdered on a beach in Thailand. A white horse-drawn hearse with a mounted police escort took 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge on her  final journey from her family home in Hemsby, Norfolk, to what her family had touchingly called 'Hannah's party'. Hundreds of mourners lined the street as the cortege made its way along the 15-minute route to a packed-out St Mary The Virgin church, where dozens spilled over into the churchyard to listen to the service on speakers. Scroll down for video . Tribute: The funeral of murdered British backpacker Hannah Witheridge, 23, was held in her home village in Norfolk this morning . Her father Tony and mother Sue clutched hands with her sister Laura and her partner as they made their way to the service, which they had touchingly called 'Hannah's party' Bright: Scores of people, many in tears, arrived for the service in bright, colourful clothing, as requested by Miss Witheridge's family .

As the sun beat down onto her hearse on an unseasonably warm day, Miss Witheridge's family, including her mother Sue, followed Miss Witheridge's flower-laden coffin to the village church. The funeral took place as Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha defended a police investigation into the murders of Miss Witheridge and David Miller, amid concern that two arrested Myanmar men may have admitted the crimes under duress. Miss Witheridge's family had wanted to make the funeral a celebration of the young woman's life. The family said they wanted to create the atmosphere of a wedding as they bid a final farewell to their loved one. Her parents had asked for white ponies - who wore plumes of purple feathers - to lead the cortege, as a nod to their daughter's love of horses. They also asked mourners to arrive at the service in brightly-coloured outfits, reflecting their daughter's vibrancy. And they duly obliged, with hundreds of people - many of whom were visibly distressed - arriving at the church wearing floral wreaths and multi-coloured outfits. So many people came to pay their respects to Miss Witheridge, a student at the University of Essex, that around 50 listened to the service on speakers in the churchyard. The family had allowed media to observe the funeral guests as they arrived from a street opposite the church. Hannah's father Tony, her sisters Tania and Laura, and her brother Paul were among those who gave readings during the service, which was led by the Rev Charles Powles. A video of Miss Witheridge was also played. Bill Downs, a friend of Miss Witheridge, performed songs during the service, which echoed outside of the church and into the surrounding village. Songs by John Legend, Cyndi Lauper, One Direction and Ed Sheeran were heard by the 200 mourners who filled the church. The service ended with Miss Witheridge's coffin, which was adorned with pink and purple flowers, being carried out by pallbearers - which included her father - for a private burial. The song She's So Lovely by Scouting For Girls played in the background, when provoked a stirring round of applause from family and friends. Miss Witheridge's family had asked that friends and non-invited guests attending the funeral make donations to local charity Faith Animal Rescue instead of floral tributes. After the service childhood friend Dulcima Cushing, 29, said: 'It was a lovely service. It was happy but very, very sad. She was a lovely girl, really sweet. I don't know where the family managed to find the strength to get through the service.' Rev Powles added that it had been an 'unusual service' which reflected Hannah's life. He said: 'It was rather an unusual service but I felt it went very well. 'The family planned the whole thing with my help and I think it reflected Hannah's life. 'The family is as well as can be expected.' A white horse-drawn hearse with a mounted police escort took Miss Witheridge from her home to St Mary The Virgin Church in Hemsby .

Before her funeral, the family had paid tribute to a 'fun, vibrant and beautiful young woman' who will be 'sorely missed by all who knew her'. They added: 'She was dedicated, ambitious and would have made an amazing difference to the lives of many families through her chosen career as a speech and language therapist.' The 23-year-old's body was found on September 15 alongside fellow murdered Briton David Miller, 24, from Jersey, whose funeral took place last week. Miss Witheridge died from severe head wounds. Local police say two Burmese workers have confessed to the killings. Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, were arrested last Friday for the murders of the British tourists whose disfigured bodies were dumped on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao. The men, whose names were given only as Saw and Win, were paraded by police at a news conference last week as well as re-enacting the brutal assault.

Deputy police chief spokesman Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said the two suspects had been charged with three offences - conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves. Today, the Prime Minister, returning from a two-day visit to Myanmar, told reporters he would like to 'stop speculation' over the murders and 'let investigators do their work'. He said: 'I would like the media to stop speculation and let investigators do their work. We must build foreign confidence and make Britain and other foreign nations understand. They might be a little surprised why the criminals were caught so quickly. I myself was excited. 'I want all Thais to stop and think that authorities have procedures in place. Nobody would dare catch the wrong person because this is a case of big international interest.' Prayuth added: 'They are not the culprits yet. We will handle this case with special attention, very fairly, so that we can win the trust of Myanmar people and the international community.' The inquiry has been dogged from the outset by contradictory statements by officials. Police were widely accused of bungling the investigation, including chasing the wrong leads and failing to seal off the crime scene quickly enough. They have strongly denied allegations of abuse during the investigation. Miss Witheridge died from severe head wounds. Yesterday, her family said: 'As a family we hope that the right people are found and brought to justice' Deputy police chief spokesman Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said two suspects have been charged with three offences over the murders of Miss Witheridge (left) and Mr Miller (right) - conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery . In a statement released yesterday ahead of her funeral, the family hinted at their concern over the case. They said: 'Time makes the pain of this horrendous tragedy no easier to bear. 'The past three weeks have been unimaginably difficult and there are no words that can adequately describe the heartache and despair that our family is experiencing. 'As we continue with our plans for our beautiful Hannah's 'party', our thoughts are with David Miller's family who are suffering the same indescribable agony. 'Due to the nature of her passing, our beautiful girl has had little privacy. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to ask that Hannah be allowed a well-deserved day of privacy on Friday whilst we join her many friends in a celebration of her life.

"An Australian fan successfully sneaked backstage at Miley Cyrus’ Sydney concert whilst disguised a cleaner, slipping past security undetected with a hi-vis jacket and mop. Australian promoter, Anthony Skinner, has shared photographic proof of his daring act on Social Media –astonished that his his spur-of-the-moment idea actually worked. The 23-year-old took to Facebook to describe his incredible dare, which all began when he stumbled across the cleaner’s open storeroom after the show. Scroll down for video . Anthony Skinner snuck backstage at Allphones Arena after Miley Cyrus' concert by dressing up as a cleaner. He posted photos to social media (pictured) showing him hidden backstage . Anthony Skinner saw Miley but was so nervous that he 'froze up' and couldn't think of anything to say . ‘I started looking for a way in thinking to myself ‘What’s the worst that can happen? They kick me out? The concert’s already over,”” Skinner told Faster Louder. ‘Found boots, a fluro vest and gloves in the carpark cleaners storeroom (sic),’ Mr Skinner posted to his Facebook page. ‘Put it all on, my shoes and possessions in a garbage bag, that garbage bag in a wheelie bin, then walked through the back boom gate where everyone was waiting for her car. ‘How goods that. This is possibly the best thing I’ve ever done!’ Mr Skinner left a note for Miley Cyrus in the pocket of his treasured leopard print jacket. The 23-year-old gave the jacket to an official, who promised to hand it on to the young pop sensation . Mr Skinner claims that in his hi-vis gear pushing a wheelie bin security let him go straight backstage, where Miley Cyrus’ after party was allegedly due to take place. Secu ‘didn’t even look at me.’ ‘My mindest was “see how far you can take this,”’ Mr Skinner explained to bbc.co.uk. ‘It wasn’t planned at all. Everything just fell into place so perfectly.’ Once he was in, it wasn’t all fun and games. To blend in, Mr Skinner stayed in character, cleaning Allphones Arena for 40 minutes. Before the concert, Mr Skinner posted a selfie on Instagram wearing the jacket that gave to Miley that night, with a note hidden in the pocket with his contact details . According to Mr Skinner, Miley Cyrus walked past him and smiled at him, but he was too nervous to talk to her. ‘As she walked past all I could muster was a gentle ‘hey’ with a smile and some eye contact. She definitely noticed me… . 'I froze up, choked, and could barely get any words out, my mind just went completely empty,’ Skinner told Faster Louder. ‘(I) wish I grabbed a photo with her… I was so scared,’ Mr Skinner wrote on his Facebook page. ‘But obviously I couldn’t just whip my phone out. But… I was like “hey.”’ However, Mr Skinner did muster up the strength to leave a note for Miley Cyrus, hidden in a leopard print jacket which he handed to an ‘official looking man’. ‘It’s literally the most perfect jacket ever made,” he explains. Mr Skinner desperately hopes Miley receives his note, which includes his mobile number, Instagram and Twitter accounts. ‘Miley,Keep killing it babe. Loved you from the start. Chillz,’ the letter read. After the incredible incident, Mr Skinner was sent a questionnaire by Allphones Arena, asking him to rate his experience at the concert. The young man found questions about 'ease of access', 'overall cleanliness inside the arena' and 'security & safety precautions during the event' particularly amusing. 'Overall cleanliness? Very satisfied, I did half of it myself,' Mr Skinner joked to BBC. Mr Skinner was sent a questionnaire by .","Australian Anthony Skinner snuck backstage after Miley's Friday concert .

"A pianist has been left horrified after finding a dead earwig lurking in his Marks & Spencer wholefood salad. Lee Reed, 36, said he felt 'physically sick' after nearly swallowing the insect, which he discovered in the pre-prepared salad he bought from the M4 service station near Reading, Berkshire. The wedding musician, from Watford, Hertfordshire, has now hit out at Marks & Spencer after the store handed him a £15 gift voucher for the 'isolated incident'. Wedding pianist Lee Reed, 36, said he felt 'physically sick' after finding a 'massive' earwig in his nutty super wholefood salad, which he bought from Marks & Spencer at the M4 service station near Reading, Berkshire . Mr Reed found the dead earwig in a pre-prepared Marks & Spencer nutty super wholefood salad (pictured) 'It's basically a fob-off,' he said. 'I don't want to be one of those greedy compensation claimants but I feel the way I have been shrugged off is not fair. 'It was horrible. I couldn't eat anything for the rest of that day.' Mr Reed said he regularly bought the store's nutty super wholefood salad and picked up the offending one as he made his way to a wedding gig in Reading. The salads are priced at two for £3.50. However, he said he wouldn't be purchasing any food from the high street chain again. He said 'I wouldn't buy anything from there again, absolutely not, because you just don't know anymore. 'Just the thought of it put me right off my food - it was right at the bottom so I'd had a few mouthfuls. 'I was just about to put it in my mouth when I saw it was there. 'It was just disgusting.

"Cincinnati Bengals' Devon Still is melting hearts across America. The tough-guy American Footballer has posted a touching video of him giving his four-year-old daughter Leah a pep talk before she went into surgery to remove a cancerous tumor. The video, posted on Still's Instagram page shows him delivering a 'pre-surgery pep talk' while driving his little girl to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia for treatment on a Stage 4 tumor. Scroll down for video . Devon Still and Leah do a non-contact fist-bump in in their reflection at the end of the dad's pre-surgery pep talk . 'I'm gonna ask you again,' Still, 24, says to his daughter, sitting behind him in the car. 'I'm ready for today. You ready for today?' Leah grins, nods and says, 'Uh huh.' 'You ready to get this cancer up out of you?' Devon asks, eliciting an 'mmm-hmm,' from Leah. 'Let's do it! Fist-bump!' Then the athlete and Leah  do a non-contact fist-bump in in their reflection. Still, who plays defensive tackle for the Cincinnati Bengals, admitted that he was 'nervous and scared beyond words', adding, 'but I'll never let her see it...let's get this done!' But it seems that Still's pep talk did just the trick. He later posted: 'After a 5hr 50min surgery the surgeon was able to remove ALL of her tumor and all of her lymph nodes and her right adrenal gland where it all started from.' Still, who plays defensive tackle for the Cincinnati Bengals, admitted that he was 'nervous and scared beyond words', adding, 'but I'll never let her see it...let's get this done!' However, Still made it clear that Leah still faced a long road ahead, as the little girl will require further treatments to remove the cancer in her bone marrow. He Tweeted: 'Just to clear up some rumors...my daughter is NOT cancer free..today was a big step towards that but still a long road ahead. 'She has stage 4 which means the cancer spread to her bone marrow which we hope will be removed with her next couple of treatments.' Still has not been able to devote himself fully to football since Leah was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma and given a 50-50 chance of survival. He went public with his daughter's cancer diagnosis 'not for sympathy,' he wrote on Instagram, but 'because I've come to the point where I no longer [am] feeling sorry but [want] to ask that y'all keep my daughter in your prayers... 'I'm gonna ask you again,' Still, 24, says to his daughter, sitting behind him in the car, giggling at her dad's pep talk. 'I'm ready for today. You ready for today?' 'The more prayers that go up, the move faith we [have] that she will overcome this obstacle,' he wrote. 'if y'all know me y'all know this girl is my world...I know that she is strong and she won't let anything hold her down without a fight.' Initially missing out on Cincinnati's 53-man roster so he could be by his daughter's side, Still was then offered a spot on the practice squad, ensuring  Leah would be covered under the team's health insurance policy. Still set up a donation program encouraging people to pledge money for every sack the Bengals' defense gets this season  in an effort to help raise money and awareness about pediatric cancer. 'Kids always look up to their parents, but in just a matter of a week that all reversed for me,' Still wrote on the campaign page . The Cincinnati Bengals have announced they will donate 100 per cent of the proceeds from sales of Devon Still's jersey to the the Cincinnati Children's Hospital . 'I can honestly say I truly look up to my daughter now. In the four years of life she has had, she has been through way more than I have in 24. Her courage, strength, and high spirits through it all is nothing short of inspirational. 'So I am dedicating my season to her and inspiring others like she has inspired me.' In addition, the Cincinnati Bengals have announced they will  donate 100 per cent of the proceeds from sales of Devon Still's jersey to the  the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Still's No.75 jersey sold more in its first 24 hours than any other Bengals jersey had in a single day - partly due to the efforts of New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton, who heard about the fundraising drive, and promptly purchased 100 jerseys.","The footballer gives daughter Leah, 4, the pep talk as they drive to hospital .

"Student volunteers carried out a quick cleanup of Keene State College campus after classmates set fires in the streets and overturned at least one car during a riot at a pumpkin carving festival. At least one car was flipped over by crowds of people, and the photos showed streets littered with beer cans, but students said there were enough volunteers to finish cleaning in under a half hour. 'We all recognize that we made a mistake and we're going to better next year,' said Mallory Pierce, Keene State sophomore and student body vice president. 'We're not going to let this happen again.' Cleanup: Student groups and athletic teams called for volunteers, who showed up to offer help in a campus-wide cleaning after riots marred Keene Pumpkin Fest . Groups flooded the streets coming from parties being held along with the  Keene Pumpkin Festival, an event where attendees try to carve and light a record-number of pumpkins each year. Keene police reports state that one group made threats to assault an elderly man and said an attendee overheard others talking about killing police. At least 30 were reportedly injured during the riots, with 20 needing to be transported to the hospital, according to Keene Fire Chief Mark Howard who spoke with New England Cable News. News cameras and attendees on social media caught rioters flipping a car, tearing street signs from the ground and setting fires in the streets. At least 49 people were arrested over the weekend, though not all were related to the out-of-control partying. Most of those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct or alcohol-related offences. College President Anne Huot released a statement saying that the school would look at social media and photos of the riots to identify any students involved. Hauling: Student volunteers were able to finish the majority of their cleaning operations in under a half hour on Sunday . Trashed: Keene State students volunteered to clean up the massive amounts of garbage and destruction left behind by rioters . Mob: Groups of partiers overturned a car and reportedly jumped from roofs during wild rioting coinciding with Keene's Pumpkin Festival . Bloodied: Several students, including this unnamed boy, had been injured by beer bottles thrown at one party off campus . Wild: Huge crowds including Keene State College students and visitors to an annual pumpkin festival in New Hampshire became unruly Saturday, leading to injuries and arrests . Injuries: The Southwestern New Hampshire Fire Mutual Aid organization said on Twitter that several people were injured from thrown bottles at a party involving hundreds of people . Geared up: Police arrived on scene in riot gear, using tear gas and pepper spray to disperse rioters in the streets, leading to at least 49 people being arrested . 'The most serious offenders will face interim suspension, followed by conduct action up to, and including, expulsion,' the statement read. Huot also said in recent years some have encouraged visitors to come to the pumpkin festival as 'a destination for destructive and raucous behavior.' Keene State student Ellery Murray told The Boston Globe she was at a party that had drawn a large crowd when people started throwing things. Situation: New Hampshire Gov Maggie Hassan said state and local safety officials worked to defuse what she called 'the situation' Fall fun: The pumpkin festival happens every year, with revelers coming to try and set the record for most pumpkins carved in a single location . Festival: The pumpkins go on display for visitors and Keene State President Anne Huot has said that the festival has lately attracted people looking to engage in 'destructive and raucous behavior' 'People were just throwing everything they could find — rocks, skateboards, buckets, pumpkins,' she said. 'People just got too drunk.' 'It got way out of hand. Everyone I talked to said, ""I feel unsafe, I'm going home."" They didn't want to be part of the riot, and they couldn't do anything to solve it,' said Pierce. 'I honestly did not feel safe.' Brian Mazzola told the Associated Press that many in his building had not gone outside Saturday night after hearing about the escalating mayhem. He claimed some of the violence resulted from police breaking up house parties earlier in the night, leaving 'a mob of drunk kids on the street,' though he felt the later response was justified. 'It was kind of scary,' he said. 'We could hear the helicopters circling around telling people to go inside.' With media coverage of protests over the shooting death of Michael Brown often focusing on looting, people took to Twitter to critique how the media depicted well-off college students rioting. Users also jumped on the #pumpkinfest and #pumpkinspiceriots hashtags to poke fun at the rioters. 'How you get arrested in head to toe LL Bean though?!'  tweeted Charles Wade. 'I heard the chili used in the pepper spray isn't even organic or fair-trade,' another user krsna joked.","Student volunteers showed up Sunday morning to pick up after classmates .

"She was said to be ‘terrified’ about stepping in for Claudia Winkleman on Strictly Come Dancing at the weekend. But Zoe Ball needn’t have worried – fans of the show think she did such a good job that they are calling for her to become a permanent member of the team.

Zoe Ball (left) stood in for Claudia Winkleman to present Strictly Come Dancing with Tess Daly (right) Some called for the former Radio One DJ to be paired with or replace Miss Winkleman, 42, who had to stay at home to care for one of her children who was poorly. One viewer wrote: ‘Oooh just switched Strictly on. I love Zoe Ball! She always dresses so well, I love her hair. Get rid of Tess and let Zoe & Claudia present!’ Another posted: ‘They’ve got rid of Brucey ... how long til they scrap Tess so we can finally get the Zoe Ball & Claudia Winkleman dream team.’ A third pleaded with the BBC: ‘BBC Strictly Zoe Ball is SOOOO much better on Strictly than Claudia. Please keep her on the main shows.’ Currently Miss Ball presents Strictly’s spin off show It Takes Two, which sees her interview contestants every week night on BBC2. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills, who last night became the latest contestant to leave, claimed Miss Ball wasn’t eyeing a move to the main show following her success. Viewers tweeted their support for Miss Ball, with some calling on the BBC to give her a permanent slot on the show instead of either Miss Daly (left) or Miss Winkleman (right) He said: ‘I saw her before backstage and she was absolutely terrified. Obviously she’s done live television for quite a few years but there’s something about doing the main show that is a lot of pressure. ‘She nailed it, she always does.

"The parents of a young woman killed in the Colorado theater massacre have filed a lawsuit against four retailers, accusing them of improperly selling ammunition, tear gas, a high-capacity magazine and body armor to suspected gunman James Holmes. The lawsuit alleges it was illegal and negligent to sell the gear to Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 70 when he opened fire inside a suburban Denver theater during a midnight screening of the Batman film The Dark Knight Rises on July 20, 2012.. It says the companies had no safeguards to keep dangerous people from buying their goods. Scroll down for video . Staying strong: Lonnie and Sandy Phillips speak during a news conference Tuesday about their lawsuit accusing four online retailers of improperly selling ammunition used in the attack . Looming large: Jessica Ghawi, 24, seen in a portrait on the left, was among the 12 people killed in the July 20, 2012 Colorado theater shootings . 'It was highly foreseeable to (the) defendants that their potential customers included persons with criminal intent, including persons such as James Holmes,' the lawsuit says. The suit was filed by Sandy and Lonnie Phillips of San Antonio, whose daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was among the fatalities. 'We're putting them on notice,' Lonnie Phillips said at a news conference in Denver. 'We're coming after you.' Ghawi, 24, was an aspiring sports journalist who had moved from Texas a year earlier. Less than two months before her death, she had survived a shooting at a Toronto mall that left two people dead and several wounded. Shooter: James Holmes, 26, pictured in court in July 2012, pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of murder and attempted murder . Her parents are represented by attorneys for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence and two Denver lawyers. 'As gunowners, parents, and citizens of this country, we . hope that our lawsuit will spare other families the tragedy that . we have gone through after the death of our beautiful daughter,' a tearful Sandy Phillips said in a statement. Named as defendants in the case are Lucky Gunner of Knoxville, Tennessee, Bullet Proof Body Armor of Tempe, Arizona, BTP Arms of New Oxford, Pennsylvania, and the Sportsman's Guide of South St. Paul, Minnesota. None of the companies immediately returned telephone messages seeking comment. The lawsuit says Holmes bought at least 4,300 rounds of ammunition from Lucky Gunner's website, bulkammo.com, and 700 rounds of ammunition and a 100-round magazine from the Sportsman's Guide website. It says Holmes bought two tear gas grenades from BTP Arms and four pieces of body armor from bulletproofbodyarmorhq.com. The 100-round magazine was one factor that prompted Colorado in 2013 to ban the sale of magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. Investigators have said Holmes' 100-round magazine jammed during the attack, preventing even more bloodshed. Prosecutors said Holmes also bought two handguns, a shotgun, a semi-automatic rifle and other equipment from other retailers that are not named as defendants. Word of warning: Lonnie Phillips and his wife said at a news conference in Denver that they are coming after the ammunition retailers . Full of life: Jessica Ghawi, 24, was an aspiring sports journalist who had moved from Texas a year earlier . Life or death: Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Holmes, whose trial will get under way in December . The lawsuit renews the gun control debate in the courts at a time when advocates of tighter restrictions have been relatively quiet in state and national politics, wary of motivating gun-rights voters to turn out in greater numbers. After Colorado passed gun control laws in 2013, voters ousted two lawmakers who supported the measures. A third resigned to avoid a possible recall. Dave Kopel, research director for the Independence Institute, a conservative-leaning Colorado think tank, said the suit will have a difficult time overcoming a federal law that protects the legal manufacture and sale of weapons and ammunition. Previous lawsuits have attempted but failed to overturn the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, said Kopel, an attorney who represents 53 Colorado sheriffs trying to overturn Colorado's 2013 gun laws. They are appealing a federal judge's ruling against them. Ammo: The lawsuit says Holmes bought a 100-round magazine from the Sportsman's Guide website . Buying in bulk: Lucky Gunner's website, bulkammo.com sold he shooter at least 4,300 rounds of ammunition .

Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

"The hermit thrush  may well be the Beyoncé of the bird world thanks to its tuneful melodies, a study has revealed. Scientists have discovered that the North American songbird sings in 'harmonic series', a pattern of pleasing-sounding notes commonly used in popular human music. By studying how birds sing, experts hope to learn how much of human musical heritage is shaped by biology, compared to culture. Ultimate songbird? Scientists have discovered that the hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus) pictured, sings in harmonic series, which is a component in popular human music. A harmonic series stems from a base note and is followed by notes that increase in pitch, based on multiples of the original note . A harmonic series stems from a base note and is followed by notes that increase in pitch, based on multiples of the original note. Scientists found that around 70 per cent of the bird’s songs followed this pattern, Smithsonian reported. Male hermit thrushes (Catharus guttatus) sing between six and 10 types of song, which tend to be high-pitched and fast, beginning with a long whistle, the study revealed. Emily Doolittle, a composer at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle and Tecumseh Fitch, a biologist at the University of Vienna, analysed 144 different song types from 14 male hermit thrushes. Experts found that  70 per cent of the hermit thrush's (pictured) songs were based on notes in a harmonic series, making them similar to human compositions . ‘Listening to the songs full speed, they are very attractive, but we didn’t have any inkling that we would hear the harmonic series in them,' Dr Doolittle said. But after they slowed them down, the harmonic series patterns became clear and statisticians analysed the bird’s choices of pitch in the song. Around 70 per cent of the songs analysed followed harmonic intervals, compared to just five per cent which seemed to include random notes. Scientists are interested in why the bird sings in this way, because the bird’s vocal tract is not specially designed to produce the specific notes in the series. They believe that female hermit thrushes may pick their mate by his harmonic accuracy – or the combination of notes may simply be easier for them to remember, just as they are for humans. Dr Doolittle emphasised that the birds don’t deliberately compose their songs using scales, but noted that other birds also like intervals used in human music. For example, previous studies have shown that musical wrens use them and domestic chickens favour consonant notes – a combination of notes that sound pleasant when played at the same time. Dr Doolittle said: ‘The harmonic series is a physical phenomenon, not a culturally specific construct, like any scale, so it makes sense that this could be found in songs of a variety of different species.’ She believes that because humans share musical characteristics with other species, there may be something in our shared biology that makes certain note combinations attractive. The research was published in the journal PNAS. Europe has an estimated 421 million fewer birds than three decades ago, researchers claim. Experts blame modern farming methods and the loss and damage of habitats for falling numbers of many common species, according to the paper published in science journal Ecology Letters. ‘This is a warning from birds throughout Europe. It is clear that the way we are managing the environment is unsustainable for many of our most familiar species,’ said Richard Gregory of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which co-led the study. ‘The conservation and legal protection of all birds and their habitats in tandem are essential to reverse declines.’ The study found that about 90 per cent of the decline occurred in the most common bird species, including grey partridges, skylarks, sparrows and starlings. Meanwhile the population of some rarer birds had increased in recent years, probably due to conservation efforts and legal protections. Richard Inger of the University of Exeter, who was involved in the study, said: ‘Significant loss of common birds could be quite detrimental to human society.’ The scientists estimated the loss of bird populations by analysing data on 144 species of European birds, collected from surveys in 25 countries. They have called for increased conservation through urban green space projects and environmental farmland schemes.","Researchers from the Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle and the University of Vienna, analysed 144  song types from 14 male hermit thrushes .

"A group of incensed passengers prevented a top Pakistani politician from boarding a flight after they were kept waiting on the runway for two hours until he arrived. A video clip shows Senator Rehman Malik, the country’s former Interior Minister being ejected from the Islamabad-bound Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight on Monday evening. Dr Ramesh Kumar Wakwani, a Member of National Assembly, was jeered in his seat and also forced to leave the plane. Disgruntled passengers can be heard referring to the men as ‘so-called VIPs’ as they wait for the two delayed politicians aboard the aircraft, while members of the flight’s cabin crew are seen attempting to calm the travellers down. ‘No, no, no, sir,’ one of the passengers responds. ‘We've taken it for too long. For 68 years. Are we going to take it for another 68 years?’ When Senator Malik finally appears, the angry passengers immediately begin hurling abuse forcing the politician to hurriedly retreat to the terminal building. ‘You should go back,’ shouts one. ‘You should apologise to these passengers. You should be ashamed of yourself, 250 passengers have suffered because of you. It is your fault, sir.’ Mr Malik initially appears to remonstrate but his comments are barely audible as they are drowned out by the furious passengers. Pakistan's former interior Minister Rehman Malik was blocked from entering the plane by angry passengers . The video grab that went viral shows passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines flight PK-370 from Karachi booing and ridiculing the lawmakers, and forcing Rehman Malik off the flight . As Malik argues with the passengers, one traveller replies, ‘You are not a minister anymore!’ Rehman Malik was Pakistan's Interior Minister between 2008 and 2013. Meanwhile, Dr Ramesh Kumar Wakwani had already managed to board the plane when furious passengers also forced him out of his seat after chanting ‘shame, shame, shame’. Rehman Malik later took to Twitter to defend himself and insisted that PIA should be blamed for the flight's delay and not himself . Mr Malik eventually boarded another plane to Islamabad after being refused entry to his initial flight . As he left the aircraft, most of the 250 passengers applauded. Monday night's Pakistan International Airlines flight from Karachi to Islamabad eventually took off without the two men. ‘There are times when something you dream of actually happens, like Senator Rehman Malik getting booted off that Pakistan International Airlines flight,’ wrote Rabia Ahmed in a blog post for Pakistan's Express Tribune.

"Five swimmers had to be rescued from an aggressive dolphin in Ireland last night. The dolphin ‘attacked’ the group of swimmers, by ‘circling and swimming at them in an intimidating way’. According to bystanders, the mammal glanced off the swimmers with his tail and nose during the attack off Blackrock Tower at Salthill, Galway. Not so cute: The dolphin attacked a group of swimmers at Salthill, Galway, on Wednesday night (stock image) A member of the public raised the alarm and contacted the coastguard who requested the assistance of the Galway Lifeboat. When it arrived at the scene around 7:30pm, a local fishing vessel had separated the dolphin from the swimmers. The lifeboat joined the fishing vessel in keeping the dolphin away from the swimmers until they made it safely ashore. According to Galway RNLI, the swimmers were very shook by the incident but did not require medical assistance. Lifeboat Helmsman Ciaran Oliver said the crew stayed in the area a while longer to ensure all swimmers got ashore and then did a sweep of the beach from Blackrock to Seapoint to warn others, assisted by additional lifeboat crew on the promenade. This is the second ‘dolphin attack’ to take place in Ireland in the past few months. In July, a bottlenose dolphin was reported to have deliberately pushed a man underwater while he was swimming in the sea off Sherkin Island, County Cork. The animal is said to have ‘lashed out’ at the swimmer twice with its tail, and acted ‘aggressively’.","Irish coastguard called to Salthill, Galway, after 'dolphin attack'

"A murderer who dodged prison for 17 years after stabbing a man to death in London has been jailed. Kiranjit Uppal, 37, fled the UK after Harminder Singh Jhaghra, 28, was killed in Hayes, west London, during a gang feud in 1996. Uppal had been living a 'relatively comfortable life' in India before he was arrested in September last year after boarding a flight to Heathrow, Isleworth Crown Court heard. Kiranjit Uppal, 37 (left), has been jailed for a minimum of 16 years for the 1996 murder of Harminder Singh Jhaghra, 28, who died after being stabbed during a gang fight in Hayes, west London . The court was told that Mr Jhaghra died after Uppal stabbed him in the arm, which severed an artery, causing him to bleed to death. A night of attacks on February 7, 1996, began after two associates of Uppal, from the Cranford area of Hayes, were beaten up by another gang from the Southall area. Despite receiving only cuts and bruises, word quickly spread about the attack, and a large group of Cranford men met up and made their way to a minicab office in Southall. Once there, the group - which included Uppal - attacked a 15-year-old boy who was playing an arcade game. The boy was left with severe cuts to his head, and a broken elbow. Mr Jhaghra was called about the attack and made his way to the minicab office, and after several phone calls between the two groups, the men agreed to meet in a nearby car park. Some of the Cranford men, armed with weapons, hid in bushes nearby, while another group stayed behind as bait. After the Southall men arrived, they were lured to the bushes before the group holding weapons jumped them. During that fight, Mr Jhaghra was stabbed in the arm. A group of men, including Mr Jhaghra, were lured to this wooded area of Watersplash Lane where another group, including Uppal, ambushed them . He managed to flag down a passing motorist and was taken to hospital, but later died. In their haste to get away, some of the Cranford group discarded weapons and clothing, some of which was linked by DNA evidence to Uppal, though the murder weapon was never recovered. Uppal, of no fixed address, was found guilty of murder at Isleworth Crown Court on Monday. Today, he was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years in prison. Detective Chief Inspector Charles King said: 'For almost 18 years Uppal thought he had got away with murdering Harminder Singh Jhaghra and had been living a relatively comfortable life in India. 'Today's sentence should send a strong message that, even with the passage of time, we will do all that we can to find those who insist on evading justice and put them before the courts. 'The events of that fateful day have left a profound effect on Harminder's family. They have had to wait 18 long years to witness this day and I would like to thank them for supporting us with this trial. 'I hope that the sentence handed down today provides them some measure of justice after such a considerable period of time.'","Kiranjit Uppal, 37, was part of armed gang that ambushed group .

"A woman suffered extensive burns to her breasts at a hookah bar after partygoers who were dancing wildly on a stripper pole knocked hot coals over her, she has claimed in a lawsuit. Katelyn Sobon, 26, is suing Trilogy Nightclub and Hookah Lounge in Philadelphia for  $50,000 in damages, claiming she suffered severe pain and humiliation and may need correction surgery. In her suit, which was filed this week in Common Pleas Cout, Sobon claims that she and a friend were seated near the dance floor on May 25 and a hookah pipe was put on a 'feeble' table between them. Suddenly, people dancing on the nearby stripper pole smacked into the leg of the table, toppling the hookah over and sending hot coals into her cleavage, the Philadelphia Daily News reported. Lawsuit: Katelyn Sobon, 26, is suing a Philadelphia hookah lounge after dancers on a tripper pole kicked her table and sent hot coals from a hookah pipe down her cleavage. She allegedly suffered painful burns . Her dress caught on fire but she managed to put it out and, after the incident, a club manager apologized and offered to pay her medical bills, the suit claims. The lawsuit, which names the club and its owner Mohamed El Laisy, she blames the bar for allowing the room to become crowded and for putting the hookah pipe so close to the dance floor. But the club's manager said that Sobon is simply trying to 'make a quick buck'. Speaking to the Daily News, he claimed that she had been offered medical attention on the night of the incident but she refused it. Since, she has visited the club three times, he said. On one occasion, she pointed out that she would not be suing and she and her friends were given free admission and drinks that night, he said. Injuries: She allegedly suffered pain and humiliation and may need correction surgery following the incident . Scene: Trilogy Nightclub has a stripper pole (left) for patrons to dance on, the manager said. He added that Sobon did not take them up on the offer of medical assistance and is just after a 'quick buck' The club then received a letter saying she was going to sue, he said. The next time she tried to come in, he stopped her. El Laisy also noted that he never saw scars or marks on her breasts, despite her complaint. Pictures on her Facebook profile also do not show any scars but it is possible the scarring could be hidden beneath clothing. 'Her allegation is fully false and we'll see her in court,' El Laisy said. 'It's just too ridiculous.' Sobon has not yet returned a request for comment.","Katelyn Sobon 'was burned after a dancer knocked over a ""feeble"" table holding a hookah pipe, sending hot coals into her cleavage'

"A primary school may ban a Ghanaian teacher from visiting because parents fear he might spread Ebola - even though his country has had no recorded cases of the killer disease. Christopher Baines, headteacher of Howden-le-Wear Primary School, has bowed to pressure and agreed it 'may be sensible' to scrap the event next Monday. Parents are threatening to pull their children out of school  because they said they were not getting 'total reassurance' he will not bring Ebola with him. Row: Parents at Howden-le-Wear Primary School in County Durham, have raised concerns about a proposed visit from a Ghanaian teacher amid fears of spreading Ebola - despite there being no recorded cases in Ghana . Howden-le-Wear primary school, near Crook, County Durham, is partnered with the Great Commission Academy, a school in Ghana. In April teachers from the British school visited Ghana to meet students and other teachers, but now the return visit has proved unpopular with some parents. This is despite Ebola cases only coming from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, which don't even share a border with Ghana. One mother, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'We have known about the trip for three or four weeks. We don't want to cause any hysteria, we just want to voice our concerns,' she said. 'This is not a witch hunt by any means, the children love the visits and the visitors are always so lovely. 'The letter we have got today addresses our concerns, but it doesn't say that there is absolutely no chance of Ebola coming over, and that's what we want - total reassurance.' In his letter to parents yesterday Mr Baines said flights to and from Ghana remain unaffected by the virus and the visiting teacher poses no risk. But now it looks like he has changed his mind. He said: Having listened very carefully to concerns reiterated by some parents this morning and in the interests of preserving our excellent relationship with them and the wider local community, I will be liaising with our governing body and the British Council today and we will make a decision following these discussions regarding the planned visit next week. 'This was designed to be an enriching experience for both pupils here and our visitor from Ghana and it is important for everyone that it is a success and focuses solely on the outcomes of our Connecting Classrooms project. 'While the expert advice we have been given remains that Ghana is not one of the countries identified as having the Ebola virus and to date no cases of the virus have been recorded there, it may be that the sensible decision is to postpone this visit.' Partnership: Teachers from the County Durham school were in Ghana earlier this year to meet teachers and students, pictured, but the return visit has upset some parents . It said: 'A number of parents have expressed their concern about the possible spread of the Ebola infection into the UK through the forthcoming visit of Mr Prempah, a visiting teacher from Great Commission Academy. 'In school we take all concerns raised by parents and the school community with the utmost seriousness and pupil/staff health and safety is our absolute primary concern. 'The health and wellbeing of our pupils is the most important thing to us so we have gone to considerable lengths to make sure we have expert advice regarding next week's visit from a number of regional and national authorities, including Public Health England, The Health Protection Agency, Durham County Council and the British Council. 'Given these facts and, following consultation with members of the school governing body, at this present time the visit planned for next week will go ahead. 'However, the situation will be monitored closely over the coming days and should any changes to this position become apparent, then immediate action will be taken.' Screening of airline passengers from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea has started at Heathrow and will be rolled out at Gatwick and Eurostar terminals. But there are calls for it to be extended to Port of Dover. The Tory MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, said that despite it being a 'complicated' disease to detect, the port should be included in the UK's screening process. A Department of Health said, however, there was no immediate plans to screen for Ebola at Britain's main passenge port. Mr Elphicke said: 'I think if we are going to do checks at airports and on Eurostar it would make sense to do it in Dover'. There have also been cases in Spain, the United States and Germany, but only from people who travelled back from west Africa or treated them in hospital. The Government has warned that Britain should expect up to ten cases of Ebola by Christmas.","Head of Durham school likely to bow to parents' pressure  over Ebola fears .

"Mexican authorities searching for 43 missing college students who were last seen in the custody of police have found another mass grave in the southern state of Guerrero. A Government official has said the human remains are being tested to see if they belong to the young men who went missing a month ago. Before today's new discovery, investigators had found a total of 11 clandestine graves containing 38 sets of human remains in the hills of Pueblo Viejo in the municipality of Iguala. Authorities came upon the new location based on statements from four people arrested early Monday, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. The new remains were found in Cocula, a town about 10 miles from where the students were last seen. Scroll down for video . Mexican marines guard the area where new clandestine mass graves were found on the outskirts of Cocula . The newly discovered mass grave was found based on statements given by four men arrested . The grave was found just outside Cocula, near Iguala in the southwestern state of Guerreo, Mexico . Police and prosecution officials work at the site, believed to be at a trash dump, in the rural area . The students, from a rural teachers' college, disappeared after a confrontation with police in Iguala, a city about 80 miles southwest of Mexico City. Authorities say the attack was ordered by Jose Luis Abarca, the mayor of Iguala who is being sought by officials, along with his wife and the city's police chief. Murrillo Karam has said the local officers took the students to a police station and then to Cocula. At some point, they were loaded aboard a dump truck and taken, apparently still alive, to an area on the outskirts of Iguala, he said. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam confirmed the four arrests in a press conference but made no mention of more remains or mass graves. He said some of those arrested could be members of the Guerreros Unidos cartel responsible for the actual disappearance of the students after the attack by local police. Two of those arrested said they received a large group of people around September 26, the date the students went missing, Murillo Karam said. Investigators were trying to confirm their statements. Mexico now has a total of 56 people in custody in the case. Mexican authorities have mounted searches for the students, spurred by increasingly violent demonstrations that included the burning of Iguala's city hall by protesters last week. Relatives of the 43 missing students carry crosses inscribed with the names of their loved ones during a protest . Protests have grown rapidly through the poor, largely rural state in southwest Mexico following the disappearance of the students . Protesters march through the streets in Iguala in anger over public officials' involvement in the case . Relatives of the missing 43 pray during a public mass held in Iguala. It has been a month since the students disappeared . The crime has shaken the country and drawn international criticism because of the involvement by police . Before today's new discovery, investigators had found a total of 11 clandestine graves containing 38 sets of human remains in the hills of Pueblo Viejo in the municipality of Iguala. Initial DNA testing of the remains determined the bodies were not those of the missing students and officials were waiting for results of second round of tests. The crime has shaken the country and drawn international criticism and protests for the involvement of officials and police. Last week, Guerrero Governor Angel Aguirre stepped down under heavy criticism of the state's handling of the case and its political support of Abarca. Rogelio Ortega Martinez, a sociologist and former university administrator, was named interim governor on Sunday. The 59-year-old Ortega previously was secretary-general of Guerrero's state public university. Ortega is a former social activist and the son of a rural schoolteacher. He has close ties to the state's ruling Democratic Revolution Party.

"Children learn better when taught in mixed classrooms rather than single-sex schools, the head of Ofsted has said. Sir Michael Wilshaw said a mixed school was more 'congenial' and that putting working-class boys in single-sex schools to try and improve their performance would be a 'nightmare'. This is despite the fact single-sex schools tend to perform better in academic league tables and exams. Scroll down for video . Children learn better when taught in mixed classrooms, the head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, has said . Sir Michael was head of St Bonaventure's School, a single-sex comprehensive in Newham, east London, before moving to the mixed Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney. He told the Sunday Times: 'I was head of an all-boys school. We did all right, but I much preferred being head of a mixed school. Girls and boys mix socially in the workplace. They should be educated together, too. 'Boys and girls do better in a mixed-school setting, as long as it is a well-run school. A mixed-school setting is by far more congenial.' And his comments were supported by Fiona Boulton, the head of leading girls' school Guildford High, who said single-sex classes were 'hyped up a lot'. Fiona Boulton, the head of girls' school Guildford High, said single-sex classes were 'hyped up a lot' She told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think if you create a really great environment then pupils do well. I don’t sell a school on it being single-sex… I sell it on the fact that we set out to be excellent in all that we do and that’s why you should choose us – not because it is an all-girls school.' Asked if the benefits of single-sex schooling were overblown, Mrs Boulton said: 'Personally, I do, yes.' Mrs Boulton, who previously worked at the co-educational Marlborough College, said working in an single-sex school 'was a complete non-issue' when it came to improving the performance of pupils. 'The girls that I had in my house there did brilliantly,"" she said. ""The girls I have here do brilliantly.' She added: 'I think there are lots of divides in this country. We talk about independent v state, boys v girls – they are all children. We just need to work out how to teach children and how to get the best out of each child rather than which school they are in.' Just 250 fee-paying schools were wholly catering for either boys or girls in the last academic year, down from 460 in the early 90s. Of those, around 150 are all-girl. On a separate issue, Sir Michael also advised parents to stop their children having a mobile phone until they were 13 and removing televisions and computers from their bedrooms. He suggested that pupils should also be banned from bringing their phones to school. He said: 'Mobile phone technology is part of the issue of low-level disruption in classrooms. Social media is part of the problem...it seems sensible to ban mobile phones from schools, then you don't get kids texting each other in class.' His comments come after a report by Ofsted, the schools watchdog, last week which found children were losing up to an hour of lesson time each day because of disruption. He was also keen to play down his public spat with former Education Secretary Michael Gove, which led to the chief inspector hinting at a 'dirty tricks' campaign against him by officials at the Department for Education. He said: 'That issue is well and truly over. The thing about Gove was that he was a reformer who believed passionately in what he was doing. 'He will go down as one of the great secretaries of state.'","Sir Michael Wilshaw says children learn better when taught in mixed schools .

"A sham wedding was busted by immigration officers - moments before the fake bride and groom said 'I do'. Officers arrived just in time to stop the fake wedding in Hull, East Yorkshire, between a 33-year-old Pakistani groom and a 27-year-old Hungarian bride. Five people were arrested, including the bride, who was wearing a full, white wedding dress and the smartly dressed groom. Three wedding 'guests' - a Pakistani man, 48, a Hungarian man, 44, and a Hungarian woman, 23 - were also arrested, following intelligence which suggested the couple's relationship was not genuine. The Hungarian bride, 27, was escorted from the Hull Register Office, by an immigration officer on Thursday . The ceremony was about to start at the Hull Register Office, at 2pm on Thursday, when the officers interrupted the big day to make the arrests. The action comes amid growing fears that people with European Union citizenship are being paid thousands of pounds to marry non-EU citizens, allowing them to stay in Britain. Mark Bates, of Home Office Criminal Investigations, said: 'Where we receive information that a wedding may be suspicious we will investigate and, if necessary, intervene and arrest those involved. 'This investigation will now continue following the arrests we have made and the evidence we have seized.' The Pakistani groom, pictured centre, was questioned by immigration officers after intelligence suggested the couple's relationship was not genuine . At the time, Detective Sergeant Andy Norris, of the UK Border Agency, said: 'We are confident we have caught these illegal activities before Hull is made a hub for this sort of crime. 'People who think they can use Hull in this way will need to think again.' The 'bride' and 'groom' are now being questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law, along with the 48-year-old man. The 23-year-old woman has been released on bail pending further investigations and the 44-year-old man has been released without charge.

"Kevin Spiolek, 52, a former professional darts player, has been cleared of groping a 14-year-old superfan . A former professional darts player has spoken of his two-year 'nightmare' after being cleared of groping a 14-year-old superfan who came forward with allegations 13 years later. Kevin Spiolek, 52, a former world number eight, was arrested in October 2012 for allegedly groping his 'number one fan' during the World Matchplay darts competition at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool, Lancashire, in 1999. Mr Spiolek - one of only eight players to have beaten Phil 'The Power' Taylor at the World Darts Championships - was charged with four counts of indecent assault following the accusations. Now the father-of-two from Cambridge has spoken of his relief after being cleared of the charges. Speaking from his home, Mr Spiolek said he and his family had been subject to a hate campaign since the allegations surfaced. He also accused the woman of living in a 'fantasy world' driven by her love of celebrity - and even suggested that he wished he had never started playing the sport. He said: 'The past two years have been absolutely awful - It's been a nightmare. I felt as though I was being treated as guilty until proven innocent. 'The person who made the accusations has had anonymity whereas my address and name have been all over the place. It shouldn't just be one way traffic. There should be protection for the accused until there is proof there. 'My daughter has been walking down the street and people have shouted abuse at her out of cars and my son and I have had our cars vandalised. 'My wife Claire and I have been married for 29 years and she has carried me through with her support. I would not have been able to cope without my wife.' He added: 'I have often said to my wife that I wish I had never played darts. I had great times in my career and some very good memories but it all pales into insignificance because of everything we have been through in the past two years. At least now I can hold my head up high and move on.' After making the allegations, the woman said she did not go to police at the time as she was 'troubled and confused' about the encounter. She said she recorded an entry in her diary instead. But she decided to come forward when she was 27, after being contacted on Facebook by a fellow darts fan who she used to see at competitions. She said the memories of the incident 'came back to her'. After being charged in October 2012, Mr Spiolek faced two trials before a jury cleared him earlier this month. Witnesses gave evidence during the trial to verify his movements on the day of the alleged incidents. Mr Spiolek - one of only eight players to have beaten Phil 'The Power' Taylor at the World Darts Championships - was charged with four counts of indecent assault. He is pictured in 2005 at the Ladbrokes World Darks Championships . Speaking today, he added: 'Until I read this person's diary I had no idea she was an obsessed fan. Lots of other people had been mentioned there. It wasn't just me. 'I was in sheer shock when I heard the diary entries. It was complete and utter rubbish. She seemed to be in a fantasy world. I couldn't believe the courts were taking it seriously, there were so many other things that were made up in her diary entries. 'Her whole lifestyle seemed to revolve around being in the limelight and mixing with celebrities. My personal opinion is that she was saying whatever she thought would win her the case.' Preston Crown Court was told that, at the time of the alleged incident, Mr Spiolek was well-known and well-respected on the darts circuit. He was one of the 16 players who created the Professional Darts Corporation and played in the first seven PDC World Championships. The court heard how the teenage fan was from a family interested in professional darts. They would go to Blackpool to watch the Matchplay tournament every year, the court heard. The woman claimed the groping incidents took place in 1999 during a darts competition at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool, Lancashire (pictured) Mr Jeremy Lasker, prosecuting, said players would mingle with members of the public, pose for photos and give autographs. The same fans would return year after year and got to know the players, he said. 'The girl became a fan of this particular player. In fact, she may have regarded herself as his number one fan and we suggest the defendant himself may have been very well aware of that fact,' he said. The complainant had alleged she took a friend with her to the tournament where they sat on the balcony, overlooking the players and public in the auditorium. She said that, when Mr Spiolek lost a match, he went up on the balcony, where the teenager join in with his commiserations. She alleged Mr Spiolek then led her to a quiet room where he began to kiss her on the lips, undid her bra, fondled her breasts and asked if she was a virgin. He then asked whether she would like to have sex with him, she claimed. The darts player was cleared by a jury after a trial at Preston Crown Court (pictured) It was further alleged there was a second sexual encounter between the pair at the evening session. She claimed Mr Spiolek asked again whether she wanted to have sex with him. Mr Spiolek always denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the allegations as 'a load of garbage'. He told police he remembered seeing her at the Winter Gardens and recalled received Good Luck cards. He added that she loved it when he said hello to her. Mr Spiolek added: 'Over the past two or three years there has been a lot of media attention on these types of cases. 'I have seen people on TV and how gaunt they look and the relief when it's all over and now I know how they feel. 'One person said the relief is not a celebration and that there are no winners - I really empathise with that feeling. When the jury found me innocent I just felt a sense of justice and relief.' Mr Spiolek, who is now a area sales representative for a stainless steel stockholder, added: 'When the police first put the charges to me I was shocked. 'I did know of the girl because she made herself known to me many years ago. I co-operated with the police, gave them all the information they needed and told the truth. When I found out I was going to court I was devastated. 'I knew all along I was innocent but there were times when I thought I might be convicted. I had never been in this position before, I didn't know much about how the criminal justice system and how it all worked. 'As a family we definitely curbed our visits out of our family home because every time we went out we were wondering what people were thinking. Sadly some we thought were friends hid away rather than support us.'","Kevin Spiolek, 52, was charged in 2012 with four counts of indecent assault .

Blake Hayes was climbing a rope on the side of a cliff face in Turimetta Head near Warriewood Beach when he slipped on a loose rock and fell from a 10 metre height. His mother, Prue Bowman, told Seven News that despite her son miraculously surviving the fall, he has 'a lot of life-threatening injuries'. Blake Hayes, 16, is in an induced coma after falling 10 metres from a cliff face in Sydney's north . The 16-year-old boy was attended by lifeguards from Warriewood beach and a number of onlookers following his fall at Turimetta Head . He is believed to have fallen about 10 metres as he climbed a rope up the cliff face . Blake (right) had been climbing up and down the rope with his best friend Robin Keuning (left) to access the notoriously dangerous Warriewood blowhole . 'He's got such a long path ahead until he's anywhere near recovered,' she said. The teenager, who had been climbing up and down the rope with only his best friend Robin Keuning to access the notoriously dangerous Warriewood blowhole, was left immobile at the bottom of the cliff, waiting for paramedics to arrive. Robin, who described the heart-stopping moment he watched his friend fall to the Sydney Morning Herald, said he'd called out to Blake to ask if he was OK and received only a 'no' in response. His mother, Prue Bowman, said that despite her son surviving, he has 'a lot of life-threatening injuries' Robin, who was panicked and called the paramedics instantly after Blake fell, said he called out to ask his friend if he was OK and heard only one clear 'no' Pictured: One of the teenagers friends climbs down to the scene, desperate for an update on Blake's condition .

Her modeling career began with catalog work in Asia, where she recalled in a recent interview: 'You can do up to 25 to 75 photos per day. To get the job, you go to these castings and you pretty much do a pose-off. 'Think of vogue-ing, but a 15-year-old girl who doesn't know anything about movement doing it. And the client would say, ""OK, today is sexy pose or today is natural. Today is cutesy pose."" And you do whatever you think that is. You have a minute to do it.' Poseur: Supermodel Coco Rocha, pictured at Milan Fashion Week in September, came up with 1,000 different poses for her new coffee table book, Study of Pose . Photo-ready: The model pouts for a snap with a fan at a book signing last week in Toronto, Canada . When she moved to New York, people thought she was overzealous with her posing, but what made her different ended up being appreciated — for the most part, she said. 'There were definitely some people going, ""What are you doing? This is so wrong and weird. This is how you model,""' she said. 'But, thankfully, there were some people at the beginning of my career that said, ""No, that's so cool, that's so great. Continue doing that.""' Rocha, 26, has been on the cover of Vogue, W and Harper's Bazaar, and she's walked the runway for Oscar de la Renta and Jean Paul Gaultier. She's also landed ad campaigns for Versace, Zac Posen and Yves Saint Laurent. Now she has compiled a coffee-table-style book of 1,000 poses titled, 'Study of Pose' (Harper Design), with photographer Steven Sebring, to be published Tuesday. Tome: The supermodel created the book with photographer Steven Sebring and will hit stores Nov 20 . 'We definitely hit many different genres,' she said. '[In] three days, we actually finished the whole book.' Rocha hopes the takeaway is that it's OK to have fun in front of the camera. 'It's definitely good to have a personality when you take photos, especially [because] we're in a time where we're documenting everything,' she said. Mother-to-be: Rocha announced her pregnancy in a YouTube video earlier this month . 'And we're a little insecure in how we look, so we think we have to turn a certain way, put our chin up a certain way. For me, I'm trying to tell people you can be goofy, you can be fun.' Rocha announced earlier this month that she is expecting her first child with husband James Conran. The couple, who have been married four years, revealed the news in a YouTube video. She added in an Instagram post: 'We are absolutely thrilled and elated to announce that after four years of marriage we are expanding our family and expecting our first child spring of 2015!'",Rocha announced earlier this month that she is expecting her first child with husband James Conran .
"The former wife of jailed sex offender Max Clifford has been pictured back with her first husband. Divorcee Jo Westwood had married the now-disgraced public relations man Clifford in 2010, but distanced herself from him when he was charged and then tried on a string of sex attacks on women as young as 15. In April, he was found guilty, then jailed for eight years – and three months ago their relationship ended with a ‘quckie’ divorce. Scroll down for video . Jo Westwood is now being comforted by her previous ex-husband Lee, from whom she separated in 2003 . But Mrs Westwood is now being comforted by her previous ex-husband Lee, from whom she separated in 2003. And to add insult to injury for Clifford, 71, his ex-wife and Mr Westood have been pictured enjoying time together in the Cotswolds village of Broadway in Wiltshire, at the £600,000 honey-coloured stone house the PR guru and his ex-wife used  as their country residence. Mr Westwood has also reportedly been seen driving the £150,000 Bentley coupe Clifford bought his ex-wife as a wedding present. Jo Westwood in the Cotswolds and with Max Clifford before he was revealed to be a pervert and jailed . Before the fall: Clifford and Mrs Clifford attend The Pride of Britain Awards at Grosvenor House in 2012 . Perhaps unsurprisingly, she has splashed out on new personalised licence plates for the car, swapping the letters MAX for JO. Mrs Westwood, 51, was a volunteer bereavement counsellor for a children’s hospice in Guildford, Surrey, which Clifford became a patron of. He later admitted that he turned to her for support after the death of his first wife, Liz, from cancer in 2003. He began courting her and she worked as his assistant at his London offices. They married after she proposed to him on a golf course in Marbella, Spain. She was notably absent from his trial, however, which featured claims he abused girls as young as 12, and allegations that his extraordinary grooming technique involved telling impressionable young women that he had an extremely small penis. A stressed-looking Jo Clifford arrives at Westminster Magistrates Court with her then husband Max looking calm as he faced charges of abusing girls . On the very day he was convicted she was seen walking near their Cotswold cottage – without her wedding ring. Now he is in jail, but his ex-wife has reportedly been seen several times with her former husband, an IT consultant with whom she has a daughter. Max Clifford arriving at Southwark Crown Court in May to be sentenced for eight indecent assaults on young women (left) and his police mugshot (right) According to the Daily Star Sunday they have been seen together at the house formerly owned by Clifford – and Mr Westwood has even been seen driving the wedding gift Bentley that used to have a MAX numberplate. A source told the paper: ‘Jo and Lee are back together and they don’t care who sees. ‘They are like a couple of love-struck teenagers and they aren’t afraid to hide it. ‘Everyone in Broadway has seen them wandering around holding hands and going for meals in the village. They seem really happy. ‘It’s a real kick in the teeth for Max, but in a way Lee has got his own back for him stealing Jo in the first place. ‘Lee still has his own place but is spending most weekends with her in the house which she got in the divorce, and he’s even been driving the car Max got her after they got married.’ The Sunday paper also claimed Mrs Westwood had been seen visiting a jeweller’s with her ex-husband, and wearing a large ring. The source told the newspaper: ‘All Jo’s family and friends are really pleased that after everything she’s been through she is happy again. ‘None of them ever really liked Max. He was a bully and really put her through the mill. ‘She’s had a really tough couple of years with the allegations against Max but she’s put it all behind her. ‘For the first time in ages she has a huge smile on her face.’ Mrs Westwood divorced Clifford on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour, saying he caused her stress and heart palpitations.","Jo Westwood proposed to Max Clifford on a golf course in Marbella, Spain .

"U2 frontman and humanitarian Bono has blasted Tony Abbott for not joining the global fight against Ebola, labelling the government's decision to not send medical workers to West Africa 'outrageous' and 'not very Australian.' The singer criticised the Prime Minister's failure to respond to the outbreak of the deadly disease 'at the source' during an interview on 60 minutes. '(Politicians have) got to account for their actions, including your Prime Minister,' Bono said. 'I thought it was outrageous, the idea that you wouldn't send medical workers to West Africa.' 'This is just not the Australia that I know.' Scroll down for video . 'To think Australia's very far away and you can protect yourself by protecting the airports and the docks, it's not very smart,' Bono said during the interview . The British are sending 750 people to help in Sierra Leone while the US has dispatched more than 3,000 to Liberia . Bono lambasted the Abbott government for only being concerned with protecting Australia's borders. 'To think Australia's very far away and you can protect yourself by protecting the airports and the docks, it's not very smart,' Bono said. 'You have to protect it at the source of the problem. These diseases do not respect borders.' Earlier this month, UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon reached out to U2's frontman, asking him to join the fight against Ebola by potentially holding a concert to raise money to battle the virus. He made the plea as it was revealed a trust fund he launched to provide fast and flexible funding for the fight against Ebola has only $100,000 in the bank. The fund, which is part of a $1 billion UN appeal for humanitarian needs in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, is intended to provide fast and flexible funding to respond to the medical emergency. 'This is just not the Australia I know', Bono told 60 minutes of the Abbott government's decision to not send aid workers and medical professionals to West Africa to help the fight against Ebola . The World Health Organisation last week estimated that unless 70 per cent of infected people were treated in the next two months, there will be 10,000 new cases each week, affecting potentially 1.4 million west Africans . But as it became clear its funds would do little alone to stem the spread of the killer virus, Mr Ban revealed he was considering alternative measures. 'I would welcome any initiative taken by Mr. Bono or some other leaders around the world to join this campaign to mobilise funds and mobilise awareness to take urgent action all together and to show solidarity,' Ban said. Bono is the founder of an anti-poverty foundation ONE, which campaigns to end extreme poverty and preventable disease. 'I think we all saw this (picture of) this young kid lying in her own excrement and a load of people just standing around watching her die because they didn’t, they just knew not to touch her and she’s lying there dying,' Bono told 60 minutes. 'These are very dangerous moments.' Bono is the founder of an anti-poverty foundation ONE, which campaigns to end extreme poverty and preventable disease . Bono also took the Prime Minister to task for slashing the funds dedicated to proving foreign aid. 'I know you've got difficulties, every country does, and I respect them but I think the aid budget got 20% of the cuts, so that's a lot of lives,' Bono said, speaking about the Australia's 2014 Federal Budget. 'It just doesn't strike me as being very Australian.' Bono's comments come after the head of the country's medical association implored the government to formulate a plan - labelling Australia's response to Ebola 'a shambles.' Associate Professor Brian Owler called for the government to develop and announce a plan to help deal with the crisis. Apparently 16 health care workers have been trained to go to west Africa and do 'dangerous work' with Ebola patients, Australian Medical Association president Associate  said. Australian Medical Association president Associate Professor Brian Owler is calling on the government to develop and announce a plan to help deal with the crisis . But neither the AMA nor the Chief Medical Officer know who the people are, what sort of training they've had and whether they're properly prepared. It's not the AUSMAT (Australian Medical Assistance) teams that you would expect would be trained to do this work,' Assoc Prof Owler told reporters in Sydney. 'Who are these people? If anything is going to be irresponsible it would be a last minute announcement about people who are ill-equipped or ill-trained to go and do this dangerous work'. 'People should be reassured that the risk of transmission of that infection is very, very, low, but obviously it is a concern,' he said. Opposition leader Bill Shorten has also accused Prime Minister Tony Abbott of not doing 'enough to deal with this crisis'. 'Logic dictates that you're better off dealing with the outbreak of a deadly and serious contagion closer to the source than waiting until it comes to Australia or comes to Papua New Guinea,' he said. 'If you want to deal with a contagion and a disease which is deadly and spreads very rapidly, you're better off dealing with it early.' Opposition leader Bill Shorten has also accused Prime Minister Tony Abbott of not doing 'enough to deal with this crisis' The US and UK asked for assistance from Australia a month ago, Assoc Prof Owler said. The British are sending 750 people to help in Sierra Leone while the US has dispatched more than 3,000 to Liberia. 'While we drag our feet on this issue, while the government continues to roll out the tired old excuses about why we can't respond, unfortunately people are going to continue to die,' he said. The World Health Organisation last week estimated that unless 70 per cent of infected people were treated in the next two months, there will be 10,000 new cases each week, affecting potentially 1.4 million west Africans. He's called on the government to announce what it is going to do to help tackle the 'humanitarian crisis' overseas and what the plans are if a potentially infected person arrives in Australian. And Assoc Prof Owler has 'big questions' about mandatory quarantines at airports for people returning from affected areas, like those to be set up in the US. He said the nurse in Cairns, who had quarantined herself after showing signs of fever, had followed the right procedures by avoiding contact with others and alerting authorities.

"Eerie apparitions, spooky sightings and paranormal phenomena are all in days commute for passengers travelling to and from Leamington Spa station. And now the station which has been plagued by ghosts has employed Supernatural Liaison Officer Nick Rees as their specialist 'ghost hunter'. As Supernatural Liaison Officer Mr Rees' duties include checking ghosts' tickets, ensuring that they do not eat customers' sandwiches, directing them to their train and generally keeping these spooky spectres in check. Nick Rees from Warwick is Leamington Spa train station's Supernatural Liaison Officer . Station host Mr Rees is already a big hit with living customers and was deemed the man for the job after developing a bond with the ghostly guests. He will now patrol the station, ensuring that passengers won't have to deal with any ghostly high jinks whilst waiting to board their trains. The father of two from Warwick  volunteered for the role after being approached by Chiltern Railways. He said: 'I get on with people and I can make anyone smile. I suppose that's why I can go about my duties as a supernatural liaison officer. I respect them and they respect me.

Built in the late 1800s, the station is reputedly one of the most haunted places in Britain, with both commuters and station staff reporting supernatural incidents. One of the haunted areas is a disused basement on platform 3 which has a partially blocked off staircase that seemingly leads to nowhere. The other area is the upstairs office building where staff regularly see and hear things including doors slamming and electrical equipment turning on and off. One member of staff said: 'When we first moved into the top floor offices the people who had been there previously had obviously left in a hurry. 'Woooooooh's there?: Mr Ree's duties include checking ghosts' tickets and ensuring that they do not eat customers' sandwiches . 'I regularly have paperwork thrown about, drawers left open and hear footsteps. I find it is often a quick way to end a meeting having a door slam for no logical reason. I've now learned to live in harmony with the ghosts.' Stephen Herbert, a night time security officer at the station, said: 'Leamington Spa station is one of the most haunted places I have been to, and I've been to many. 'I often see and hear ghosts on both platforms but from what I have seen they are nice ghosts and have good energy.' As it is his first week in his extended role, Mr Rees will be giving customers garlic bulbs to take home for Halloween.","Leamington Spa station reputed to be one of Britain's most haunted places .

"Nicolas Sarkozy was joined by supermodel wife Carla Bruni on the campaign trail last night as the former French president stepped up his campaign to retake the Elysee palace. Speaking at an event in Nice, Sarkozy vowed to clamp down on illegal immigration if he is returned to power as well as readdressing the free movement of people within the European Union. Last month, Sarkozy, 59, announced that he wanted to run for the candidacy of the centre-right UMP party for the French Presidential Election scheduled to take place in April and May 2017. Scroll down for video . Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was joined at the campaign rally by his wife Carla Bruni . Ms Bruni, pictured, was said to be against her husband's plan to run again for the French presidency . However, her presence at the rally is seen as she is behind her husband's campaign to run again in 2017 . The former president addressed immigration, welfare tourism and the free movement of EU citizens during his speech. Sarkozy told his supporters: 'Schengen is no longer working, we want a new Schengen.' The Schengen agreement allowed for the free movement of EU citizens and removed border checks. Britain and Ireland opted out of joining the Schengen area. Sarkozy said: 'We can no longer afford the luxury of distributing a number of benefits to people in France illegally. 'Caring for someone in an emergency situation it is a moral imperative, but medical tourism is a scandal. 'I want to end benefits tourism in our country.' Sarkozy was defeated by socialist Francois Hollande in 2012 and told journalists at the time that they would never hear from him again. Sarkozy, pictured, said last month that he was running again because the socialists 'were ruining France' In his speech to UMP party supporters, Sarkozy said he would clamp down on welfare tourism if elected . But he indicated last year that he was considering a return to politics because the socialists 'were ruining France'. His wife, Carla Bruni, 46, had begged Sarkozy not to stand again as people were 'mean to him' when he was President. However, her presence at the rally in Nice will provide a significant boost to him in the opinion polls. Sarkozy's main rival for the UMP nomination is former French prime minister Alain Juppe, who has received the backing of former president Jacques Chirac.

"The highly-anticipated Thursday opening of a time capsule that been hidden in the head of a lion statue atop a historical landmark for more than a century yielded nothing but a red book. The Bostonian Society had expected the time capsule to include letters, newspaper clippings and other items from 1901, the year it was placed in the statue on the Old State House. Papers were found, along with the red book inside the copper box roughly the size of a modern shoebox. No crown jewel: The lion statue was placed atop Boston's Old State House in 1901 and the shoebox-sized metal box placed inside and promptly forgotten . Unveiling: Robert Shure, President of Skylight Studios, removes the crown of a lion statue containing a 113-year-old time capsule at Skylight Studios in Woburn, Massachusetts as a crowd of reporters watched in awe . The book had no visible markings, and nothing was taken out of the box because of the items' fragile condition. So, the contents of the book remain a mystery, for now. The inside of the box and its contents — there was no mold or water damage — thrilled society President Brian LeMay. LeMay said he was 'absolutely delighted' with the conditions inside the box. The time capsule was sealed inside the lion's head since 1901 and then forgotten — until recently.  Rumors of its existence were confirmed last month when the statue was taken down from the Old State House for refurbishing. The delicate removal of the box took place at a sculpting studio in suburban Woburn. Robert Shure, owner of Skylight Studio, first removed a crown atop the copper and gold-leaf lion's head, cut cables holding the box in place inside the head, and removed the rectangular box, which weighed between five and 10 pounds and measured 8-by-12 inches in length and about 6 inches deep, according to Shure. The society, which manages the Old State House, first learned about the possible existence of the time capsule years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on building renovations and was believed to have placed the time capsule in the lion's head and catalogued its contents. A 1901 article from The Boston Globe surfaced later, alluding to contents of a copper box 'which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.' Handover: Shure handed off the century old copper box as the scalped golden lion looked on . Slowly but surely: Shure, right, uses copper cutters while working with Bostonian Society President Brian LeMay, left, and craftsman George Stratakis, center, to open the sealed box . A peek at the goods: The men opened the box, which historians said likely contained documents from circa 1901 . Rumors: The society, which manages the Old State House, first learned about the possible existence of the time capsule years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on building renovations and was believed to have placed the time capsule in the lion's head . Elizabeth Roscio, the Boston Society's archivist, said the box will be brought to an environmentally-controlled setting where the contents can be carefully removed and studied. They will be put on public display at a later date. One of Boston's most popular tourist attractions, the Old State House has a storied history. It was once the seat of English rule in the northern colonies, and the original lion statue and an accompanying unicorn statue symbolized the unification of England and Scotland. It was just outside the building that British regulars opened fire on a crowd of protesters in 1770, killing five people in what would become known as the Boston Massacre. In the summer of 1776, the newly-signed Declaration of Independence was read for the first time to Bostonians from a balcony of the building, which would later serve as the first seat of Massachusetts government. The plan is to put a new time capsule in the lion's head, this one made of titanium. The society is currently soliciting suggestions of what to put in it, but said one item will be a medal from the ill-fated 2013 Boston Marathon. Red book: Inside was a red book. The experts on hand declined to even inspect it, citing its fragile condition . Bostonians have whispered about the existence of a time capsule inside the head of the lion statue placed atop the city's Old State House for years. The rumors began when a woman purporting to be the descendant of the statue's sculptor came forward, but the denizens of the Massachusetts town have had to wait until now to know for sure. A 1901 article in the Boston Globe reported on the original placement of the statue, as well as the box inside that has nbw been found: . The work of the coppersmith is completed, and one of the last things he did was to seal a copper box, which is placed in the head of the lion, and which contains contributions from state and city officials, the Boston daily newspapers, the name of the maker of the lion and unicorn, and others, which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.B .

"More than a decade after being sent to the war zone, the last British troops serving in Afghanistan are finally preparing to come home. Thirteen years after arriving in Helmand Province, the remaining servicemen and women have begun packing up military equipment ahead of their long-awaited return. In thanks for their service, a collection of stunning images documenting their final days at Camp Bastion has been shared across the UK. Among the images taken by acclaimed photographer Robert Wilson are portraits of the soldiers and landscapes of their living quarters. Rounds of artillery and weapon storage units are also depicted in the collection which offers astonishing insight into the realities of being at war. The 59 photographs are to be scattered across Britain in a bid to raise public appreciation of the soldiers' contribution and remind the country of how dangerous the conflict was.

"Decorated war hero Ken Dawson, 89,  who is pictured wearing his treasured medals, was tricked out of his life savings by  jobless bingo caller Paul Youngs . A kind hearted war hero was tricked out of his life savings in a 'dastardly betrayal' by a jobless bingo caller he treated like an old comrade, a court heard. Trusting veteran Ken Dawson, 89, befriended Paul Youngs even though the 53-year-old  was barred from their local social club where they both served on the committee. The decorated former Rifleman who fought the Japanese in Burma wanted to give Youngs a second chance and helped him pay for a car, buy meals, and only asked in return for his assistance with the weekly shop. Callous Youngs repaid the old man by using his bank card to withdraw £150 every week from his account over a four month period, which he spent on himself. By the time the thefts were discovered, when Mr Dawson checked his bank statements, he had lost up to £1,800 from his savings account. Today as Youngs was jailed for 12 weeks, Mr Dawson said he had 'paid the price' for his good deed. 'I just thought everyone deserves a second chance and unfortunately I've found out the hard way that a leopard never changes its spots,' said the great grandfather from Burnley, Lancashire. 'I had put all my trust in him fought his corner and I thought he was my friend - yet he betrayed me in a most dastardly way. 'The army makes you realise and see things, you learn trust and respect - but unfortunately I put trust in this man like I would have done one of my old comrades and sadly I've paid the price. 'I lay awake at night now and have trouble getting to sleep because I keep going through it all in my head and wonder how it happened, and why he did that to me. 'I am just pleased that he got sent down - it serves him right.' The old man was 17 when he joined the First Battalion Cameronians Scottish Rifles and had served in India, Burma and Singapore winning five campaign medals. As the oldest veteran at his local Royal British Legion he would lead the Remembrance parade in Burnley each year. Burnley Magistrates Court was told the pair had met nine years ago at Rosegrove Unity Working Men's Club where Mr Dawson had been a committee member for 30 years. Victim Ken Dawson, pictured with his regiment in 1942, was swindled out of his savings by callous Paul Youngs . Former rifleman Ken Dawson pictured with fellow veterans at the Rosegrove Unity Working Men's Club where he met jobless Paul Youngs . Youngs, who at the time worked at a care home and lived with his late mother, joined the committee and became a caller at the club's bingo nights. After he was barred Mr Dawson took pity on him. The pair would go shopping together and on day trips to Blackpool. Mr Dawson would lend Youngs money and even lent him £3,000 to buy a car. On occasions Youngs would pay him back in full but on others, if he claimed to be struggling financially, the victim told him to leave it or forget about it. Mr Dawson, a retired welder, added: 'Paul had been barred from the club but I wanted to stick up for him because it seems like the right the thing to do. War hero: Former rifleman Ken Dawson pictured in his army days was targeted by the bingo caller he treated as an old comrade. 'Everyone makes mistakes and I even tried to get him back into the club. 'We used to go shopping every Saturday afternoon and I would give him my card to get out cash for me to cover the week. 'I had trouble getting out of the car so I'd give him my card and number to get £150 but he was getting double, £150 for me and £150 for him. 'Unfortunately when I got my bank statements I would put them in the drawer and it was only when I came to look at them that I realised what had happened and I felt sick to the stomach. 'I had more or less looked after him. I used to take him fishing every Tuesday and after we had been shopping I would take him for a meal once or twice in the week. I thought he was a friend and as a friend I always paid. 'When we first started going to the hole in the wall I could see what he was doing because he parked right against it - but then all of a sudden after a few weeks he started going round the other side of the building and he was taking longer to withdraw the money. 'I don't think he is bothered or sorry for what he has done. In court he didn't even have the decency to look at me in the eye. 'It is a lot of money and my life savings and pensions I had worked hard for. I feel like I've been taken for granted.' World War II hero Ken Dawson salutes the grave of a fallen comrade near his home in Burnley, Lancs . When he was quizzed by police, Youngs, of Stansfield Street, Burnley,said he had been out of work, was struggling with bills and the money was to keep him on the ' straight and narrow.' He admitted theft between March 29 and August 22 but claimed he only stole £1,200. His lawyer Keith Rennison said in mitigation: 'He would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Dawson. 'He is extremely sorry and extremely ashamed of himself, more particularly for the impact this has had upon Mr Dawson. Should the defendant get gainful employment, he will repay him in full.' But sentencing JP Stephen Riley told Youngs: 'What you did involved a breach of trust to an extremely high degree. We want to punish you and protect the public.' After the hearing Clifford Heaton, secretary for the Rosegrove Unity Working Men's Club, said. 'We all feel very disgusted at what Paul did to Ken especially as Ken trusted him so much. 'Needless to say Paul is barred for life - but I don't think even he would come back anyway because he would be too ashamed. We have spoken about putting a charity show on for Ken in the New Year and any proceeds to go to him and if he wants he can put the proceeds to the British Legion. 'Ken is a very proud man and this has upset him. Paul used to be a good lad at one time and used to be the Bingo caller here. These days people do not have a kind word to say about him.'","Decorated veteran Ken Dawson was targeted by jobless Paul Youngs .

"Vivienne Westwood has been accused of lifting passages for her new autobiography from the work of another author. Paul Gorman, who wrote The Look: Adventures in Rock and Pop Fashion, claims to have identified 40 sections of Westwood's new book which have been used without crediting him. He claims her self-titled autobiography is 'riddled with inaccuracies' and cites two instances where passages from his work are represented as the fashion icon's own words - once in direct quotes. Mr Gorman is set to sue Picador, publishers of the book, Vivienne Westwood and co-author biographer Ian Kelly. Scroll down for video . Vivienne Westwood has been accused of using parts of Paul Gorman's book 'The Look' without crediting him . 'There's been a wholesale plagiarism,' said Mr Gorman. 'I got a copy of the book and spent four hours pouring over it and I was just astonished. 'I greatly respect Vivienne Westwood's achievements but the book is riddled with inaccuracies. 'It's a really sloppy book. It's a shoddy piece of work and she doesn't deserve it. She is a fascinating woman whose story deserves to be told properly.' The autobiography Vivienne Westwood was published earlier this month by the iconic fashion designer . Paul Gorman claims 40 parts of his book 'The Look' (left) have been used in Vivienne Westwood's autobiography without crediting him properly. He believes he has been plagiarised and is consulting lawyers . Mr Gorman said he has identified 40 parts of the book that seem to have been lifted from his own work, released in 2001, in the more than 400 page volume by Westwood and Kelly. He said he is credited eight times - less than 25 per cent and is currently 'making legal representations' through lawyers to the publishers. The writer said he is talking to lawyers about making an approach to Picador, which is part of Pan Macmillan, Ian Kelly and Vivienne Westwood about making a claim on the basis that his work 'has been plagiarised.' He claims two examples appear to represent quotes he used from Malcolm McLaren, the 73-year-old fashion designer's former business partner and lover, as her own words. Malcolm McLaren pictured with  Westwood in 1981 . He added: 'These are the most extreme examples. One in direct quotes and one in indirect quotes from Vivienne Westwood.' On his blog, Mr Gorman claims the passages below are an example of a direct lift from his book. On page 22 of The Look he quotes McLaren as saying: . 'Just look at what people like Jack Kerouac were wearing after they had left the marines and the army and went on the road. 'White T-shirt, jeans and leather jacket.' Mr Gorman claims an almost identical quote appears on page 85 of Vivienne Westwood, with the quotes attributed to the designer. He also claims there are several examples in the autobiography, which was released last week, that do not accurately credit photographers. He also said there are a number of inaccuracies such as incorrect spellings of 'Jimmy' Hendrix. 'I don't have any problem with Vivienne Westwood, I have a problem with the publisher,' added Mr Gorman. I've written books with the likes of Boy George who are outspoken people. Vivienne Westwood is entitled to say what she wants, but the publisher's job is to publish a book that does not make this kind of error.' Mr Gorman said despite requesting a preview copy of the autobiography there was no response from Pan Macmillan. He said he now owns the rights to his book after these were recently handed over by the publisher. Pan Macmillan also faces claims that it may have libeled associates of the former designer. Private Eye says the book includes a libelous comment about a former manager who Westwood claims is ‘now dead.’ That would mean he could not sue for libel, but according to the Independent the man is actually still alive. A spokewoman from PanMacmillan said: 'We always take very seriously any errors that are brought to our attention and will, where appropriate, correct them. We can also confirm that we have not received any formal communication regarding the content of the book.' Westwood and co-author Ian Kelly have not responded to requests for comment from MailOnline.","Author Paul Gorman claims 40 passages from his own work have been used .

"Anthony Wartson stashed a 'criminal arsenal' A man who stored an arsenal of weapons for serious criminals has been jailed after his DNA was found on guns and an exploding bullet. Anthony Wartson operated a virtual safe house for criminals, storing a sawn-off shot gun and other weapons. He had created a 'criminal arsenal' in an attic but was foiled when his DNA was found on the triggers of a sawn-off shotgun and a revolver, as well as on a glove that contained a 'dum-dum' bullet, designed to explode on impact. The 44-year-old had tried to claim he thought he had been given a bag of mobile phones, not weapons. But the judge dismissed this and jailed him for five years. Philip Standfast, prosecuting at Bradford Crown Court, said officers had been investigating a burglary when they found the cache at a property in Bradford in April last year. Mr Standfast said Wartson was not connected to the house but his DNA was linked to the cache of weapons. Wartson, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, admitted possessing prohibited weapons and ammunition. He had pleaded guilty on a basis that he thought he had been given a bag of mobile phones but the Recorder of Bradford, Judge Roger Thomas QC, described that as 'nonsensical'. He said criminals with such weaponry would not entrust them to 'some hapless drunk'. He added: 'He was a safe house for a criminal organiser of weapons, and serious weaponry at that.' Wartson was tracked down after his DNA was found on several guns that he had been stashing for criminals . His DNA was found on a sawn-off shotgun, discovered when police were investigating a burglary in Bradford . The 44-year-old's DNA was also found on the trigger of a revolver, linking him to the arsenal of weapons . Shotgun cartridges were found at Wartson's home . One of the guns found, which was not connected to Wartson, had been used in a shooting. Mr Thomas added: 'You were a foil for somebody with this serious weaponry, to store it away from the eyes of the police. You say the weaponry went back to the person who asked you to store it, and it did. 'Clear it is, for a period of time you gave safe haven to this serious weaponry. 'No doubt some sort of reward coming in your direction.' Anne-Marie Hutton, mitigating, said Wartson's failings were due to his misuse of alcohol. She said his involvement with the weapons was brief. After the case, Detective Inspector Ian Bryar, of the Bradford District Quartz Team, said: 'Police are committed to removing firearms from Bradford district to make sure that the people who live and work here remain safe. 'Gun crime will not be tolerated and anyone who is found to be involved in firearms incidents, or convicted of possession of a firearm can expect to receive a prison sentence.'","Anthony Wartson jailed for five years for stashing 'small criminal arsenal'

Yet another iPhone defect has been revealed from a man in Arizona who reports that he suffered serious burns when his phone burst to flames in his pocket. Arizona business coach Phillip Lechter says the incident happened on October 11, while his family was visiting the University of Arizona to watch a football game against USC. On his personal blog, Mr Lechter writes that he was riding to a tailgate party in a rickshaw with his wife and 7-year-old son, when the cart tipped over. Mr Lechter says he was checking to see if his wife and child were ok when he 'felt a burning sensation on my leg and smelled smoke from my pants'. 'I surveyed the rickshaw quickly and could not find anything that could have set me on fire. Then it hit me, my phone was in my pocket. 'Somehow in the process of the tipping of the rickshaw my new APPLE iPhone 6 had bent in my front pocket and caught on fire. Mr Lechter says the smoke was thick, and he could even see flames burning through his pocket and boxers. 'The smell was disturbing. I could feel my leg burning.

"A group of board members from one of Manhattan's most luxury apartment buildings are trying to shut down construction of a new multi-million dollar spa because of its nudist-friendly policies which they say 'violate public morals'. The stuffy campaigners, who have lodged their suit in the Manhattan Supreme Court, live in the Ritz Tower on Park Avenue, which overlooks the neighboring Galleria Building, the home of the first Manhattan-based Spa Castle. Despite the fact that the venue only allows guests to be nude while they are indoors, the residents insist that their scenic views of the city will be forever marred whenever they catch a glimpse of the spa's more free-spirited guests who choose to enjoy its many amenities while in the buff. Restricted rooftop: According to the lawsuit which was filed in the Manhattan Supreme Court, the spa's rooftop amenities are in violation of a 40-year-old building resctriction . No clothes? No way! The board members insist that the spa's nudity-friendly policy 'violates public morals' While the majority of Manhattanites have rejoiced at the arrival of the new mega-spa, which already has a sister site in Queens, it appears that prospect of having the luxurious, but nudist-friendly, venue right on their doorstep has done nothing but anger the Ritz Tower board. And it's not just the thought of glimpsing naked spa-goers that has riled the campaigners. In addition to their fears about preserving the neighborhood's moral code, the group also argue that the spa's rooftop construction violates a 1974 restriction which prevents the Galleria Building from being any higher than 82.35 feet. According to New York Post, the restriction ensures that they be granted 'unrestricted light, air, and a view over a portion of the Galleria building', all of which are under threat thanks to the spa's construction. The group's lawsuit specifies that the Spa Castle's impressive array of rooftop comforts - which include hot tubs, foot-soaking stations and a cabana-style roof - are all in violation of the height restriction and must therefore be removed. 'The height, placement and use of the newly constructed roof and spa facilities... [and] their proximity to the windows of the residential apartments in 465 Park Avenue, obstruct the view of the tenants and residents who occupy the apartments overlooking the roof of the Galleria Building,' the suit says, according to the New York Daily News. Stuffy standards: The residents of the Ritz Tower on Park Avenue are also angered by the spa's rooftop construction which they say violates local building restrictions . Luxury lifestyle: Despite the Ritz Tower group's anger, many other Manhattanites are eagerly awaiting the spa's launch . '[The] ongoing construction constitutes a public nuisance because it offends, interferes with, and causes damage to the public, including by offending public morals.' Despite the group's complaints however, construction on the luxurious venue has not only continued but has, they argue, actually sped up since they sent their first cease and desist letter back in September. According to the riled-up residents of the Ritz Tower, where a four-bedroom apartment goes for an average of $3.6 million, work now begins as early as 7am, even on Sundays, an outrage which seems to have only added to their anger. The Spa Castle Premier 57 is set to be the first of a number of the Spa Castle chain's luxury brand extensions. It will be the first of its kind to be opened in the center of Manhattan, having already won over the local residents in Queens, the home of its first New York venue. There's no stopping them! Construction on the luxury venue has not stopped, despite the lawsuit, and the spa is still due to open later this month . 'Complete wellness for the mind and body': The spa's website describes the new venue as an 'escape into the extraordinary' 'Located in the heart of Manhattan, Premier 57 offers an escape into the extraordinary,' the website explains. 'What lie inside are ancient and worldly health cultures, designed to deliver complete wellness for the mind, body, and soul. 'Focused on heat therapy, Premier 57 specializes in providing opulent hydrotherapy facilities along with a collection of unique sauna room treatments. First class spa treatments, savory snacks and beverages, and an outdoor roof deck only enhance the Premier experience found within.' The spa will take up the seventh, eighth and ninth floors of the Galleria Tower - as well as the rooftop - and is set to open later this month. Robert Lash, a spokesperson for Spa Castle, told MailOnline: 'In terms of Spa Castle Premier 57 and pending litigation, Manhattan Supreme Court today denied the Ritz Tower’s request for a temporary restraining order and set a further hearing for a later date. 'Under the terms of the easement, Spa Castle Premier 57 is permitted to use the roof, and will vigorously defend against this lawsuit. Regarding the rooftop area in question, full nudity is not permitted outside of the facility’s designated male and female locker rooms and bathing area.'","A group of board members from the Ritz Tower want to shut down construction of the new Spa Castle which is opposite their homes .

"Tommy: The case centers around chimpanzee Tommy, whose owner keeps him in a modified shed in upstate New York .

The case of a 26-year-old chimpanzee, Tommy, whose owner . keeps him in a modified shed in upstate New York, is the first . in the world seeking 'legal personhood' for a nonhuman animal. Steven Wise, a lawyer who has worked for three decades to . expand rights for animals, is trying to win an order that Tommy . has been unlawfully imprisoned by his owner and should be . released to a sanctuary in Florida. He filed an appeal after a lower court judge last year . dismissed the case. Wise told the five-judge panel of appeals court in Albany on . Wednesday that chimps are intelligent enough to experience the . same suffering as humans when kept in solitary confinement. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: Patrick Lavery, Tommy's owner, said that Tommy is a wild, dangerous animal who shouldn't be treated as a human . 'Tommy has the autonomy and self-determination to understand . that he doesn't want to be imprisoned for life in a cage,' Wise . said. Wise is using a legal mechanism known as a writ of habeas . corpus, which is traditionally employed by prison inmates who . claim they have been illegally detained. He has said that he . chose Tommy because he is one of four chimps living in New York, . where courts have taken a less restrictive view in habeas corpus . cases. Tommy's owner, Patrick Lavery, waived his right to make an . argument at Wednesday's hearing. In December, when the suit was . filed, he said Tommy had the best possible care and enjoyed . living alone. Wise on Wednesday compared chimps to human slaves, who were . treated as property by U.S. courts. Justice Karen Peters said she was troubled by the analogy . and suggested Wise abandon it. Peters said it may make more . sense for Wise to lobby lawmakers to protect chimps from . 'unlawful detention' by private owners.

Wise replied that the case was not against Lavery, who had . not violated any laws, but was intended to challenge the very . notion that chimps could be kept as private property.

"Chemicals used to make till receipts could raise the risk of developing harmful diseases such as diabetes, obesity and even cancer, scientists claim. Alarming research suggests that a substance used to produce paper in store tills, credit card machines and ATMs could be absorbed into the blood stream. Researchers say the chemical bisphenol-A - widely known as BPA - can disrupt hormones, raising the risk of a wide number of health problems. Chemicals used to make till receipts can be absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin, disrupting hormones and raising the risk of diseases like diabetes, obesity and cancer, scientist say . The chemical has already been banned in baby bottles in Europe because of safety fears. But the transparent resin is still used to line most plastic and tin food packaging - despite the calls for an all-out ban by campaigners. The UK Food Standards Agency says strict regulations mean that the health risk from food packaging is minimal. But new American research suggests that the higher concentrations of BPA on thermal paper in till receipts - which is not regulated in the same way - poses a different route for the chemical to enter the body. Scientists at the University of Missouri have found that it can enter the blood stream through the skin. BPA is absorbed more quickly when it combines with other substances including suncream, soap or hand sanitizer, they said. They also warn that people could digest the chemical if they wipe their mouth after handling a till receipt - a risk that is particularly high in restaurants. EFSA - the European Food Safety Authority - last year found that BPA posed no appreciable health risk to anyone apart from very young children. The organisation found that till receipts counted for no more than 15 per cent of exposure to the chemical, with the vast majority of the minimal concentrations of BPA in the human body coming from food packaging and diet. EFSA is currently reviewing its findings, with a new report due by Christmas. But the US scientists said till receipts are a much greater threat than previously thought. Professor Frederick vom Saal, whose work is published in the journal PLOS One, said BPA had been shown to interfere with oestrogen, the female fertility hormone, and other vital chemical balances in the human body. Campaigners have called for an all-out ban for the bisphenol-A chemical in till receipts . ‘Store and fast food receipts, airline tickets, ATM receipts and other thermal papers all use massive amounts of BPA on the surface of the paper as a print developer,’ he said. ‘The problem is, we as consumers often have hand sanitizers, hand creams, soaps and sunscreens on our hands that drastically alter the absorption rate of the BPA found on these receipts.’ In the study, researchers tested human subjects who cleaned their hands with hand sanitizer and then held thermal paper receipts. In a second test, the participants who had handled the thermal paper then were given chips to eat with their hands. The result was that BPA was absorbed very rapidly, Professor vom Saal said. ‘Our research found that large amounts of BPA can be transferred to your hands and then to the food you hold and eat as well as be absorbed through your skin,’ he said. ‘BPA exhibits hormone-like properties and has been proven to cause reproductive defects in foetuses, infants, children and adults as well as cancer, metabolic and immune problems in rodents. ‘BPA from thermal paper will be absorbed into your blood rapidly; at those levels, many diseases such as diabetes and disorders such as obesity increase as well. ‘Using BPA or other similar chemicals that are being used to replace BPA in thermal paper poses a threat to human health.’ British safety campaign group the CHEM Trust called for an all-out ban for BPA in till receipts. Elizabeth Salter Green, director of the group, said: ‘Till receipts are such a routine part of daily life, yet this research shows that bisphenol A used in them can rapidly move through our skin and into our bloodstream. ‘This chemical has been used for decades and it is shocking that the scale of this exposure has only just been identified.’","Substance used to produce receipts could be absorbed into the bloodstream .

Some are miffed that it will take city officials some eight months to fix the construction . Brooklyn's Squibb Park Bridge was always meant to bounce gently, but engineers say the motion has become too pronounced . The bridge was closed for repairs in August. Park officials announced Friday that the bridge would remain closed while engineers study the problem.

'We need to fully understand the bridge — and we want the public to know that we are really erring on the side of caution,' she added to the newspaper. The Squibb Park Bridge cost $5 million. It was a long-awaited addition to Brooklyn Heights. Some local residents were bummed out to hear their bridge would be closed for so long.

"An Australian Special Forces soldier pulled a gun on an Australian spy during an alcohol-fuelled encounter last year, an intelligence report confirms. The soldier, from Australia’s Defence support team, reportedly drew a loaded gun on a spy from the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) during a drinking session in Afghanistan, according to ABC reports. The soldier is understood to have been a part of the Special Air Service (SAS) regiment, who are assigned to protect ASIS agents at risk during highly classified and dangerous missions. According to agency policy, an ASIS agent with a blood alcohol content above zero must not be issued with or have carriage of a weapon. The soldier, from Australia’s Defence support team, reportedly drew a loaded gun on a spy from the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) during a drinking session in Afghanistan . A review of the incident found ASIS had failed to put ‘adequate controls in place’ to stop an intoxicated agent from accessing a gun. 'While no physical injury resulted, the incident had the potential to cause serious injury,' Dr Vivienne Thoms wrote in her annual report. 'ASIS’s investigation of the incident highlighted systemic issues,' According to agency policy, an ASIS agent with a blood alcohol content above zero must not be issued with or have carriage of a weapon . Dr Thoms is by Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and exposed the incident in her recently published annual report. Dr Thom had concluded a six month inquiry into the use of weapons by ASIS a month before the altercation occurred.

"A troubled schoolgirl who threw herself in front of a train had been mourning a former classmate who killed herself in the same way, an inquest heard yesterday. Mary Stroman, 16, had talked about Tallulah Wilson’s suicide and her mother said the death had ‘played on Mary’s mind’. She died while an inquest was being held into the death of gifted ballerina Tallulah, 15. Mary Stroman, left, died after being hit by a train in January this year during the inquest of Tallulah Wilson, right. Tallulah, 15, killed herself at London's St Pancras station in October 2012 . The girls were classmates at St Marylebone School in Central London but Mary was taken out of the school after one term when her family discovered she was self-harming. Her mother Sue said Mary had been upset about Tallulah’s suicide, and that when the inquest started, she had told staff who were caring for her – at a residential home for girls with emotional difficulties – to keep an eye on her. Two days after she heard about the inquest, Mary left suicide notes in her bedroom at the care unit and died after she was hit by a train on a nearby railway line. A coroner investigating her death heard she had a long history of self-harm and suicide attempts and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Mrs Stroman, 58, from Finsbury Park, North London, said her daughter had been a popular, straight-A student but became withdrawn and secretive after she turned 13. Mary refused to reveal what had happened to change her behaviour but did tell friends she had been raped, and suffered nightmares and flashbacks. Mrs Stroman said she had tried to ask Mary – the youngest of five children – what had happened but she had refused to discuss it, and had refused counselling, but had once referred to herself as ‘a whore’. Mary, 16, was troubled by Tallulah's death. Her mother Sue told the inquest: 'Tallulah played on Mary's mind and if we were going through Kings Cross Mary would say 'This is where Tallulah died'' In 2013, Mary was admitted to Tumblewood Community, a care home for girls near Westbury in Wiltshire. While there, her mother said she told her about the inquest into Tallulah’s death at London’s St Pancras station. She added: ‘Tallulah played on Mary’s mind. We would go through King’s Cross and she would say, “That’s where Tallulah died”. 'My concerns where that she would pick it up (news of the hearing) from the papers.' The court heard Mary was a 'shy' as a child but 'popular at school'. In a statement read in court, Mrs Stroman said: 'She was a shy child and was wise. She was a small and delicate child. 'She was a popular child at school and was invited to parties.' But the inquest also heard Mary had a history of self harm – and at her parent's wedding anniversary in August 2010, she had gotten 'very drunk'. The teenager, who was the youngest of five children, started to scratch her face and bite her hand and was 'hearing voices in her head'. She spent several months in The Priory clinic in London in three spells and also stayed at Simmons House adolescent unit in London. Mary was then diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder in 2011. Her mother added her Mary's decline in health had begun after she started feeling 'unsafe' in her local community and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The two girls were laboratory partners in science classes at St Marylebone and played in the school orchestra together. Sue and Scott Stroman arrive at the inquest into their daughter Mary's death in Salisbury, Wiltshire, today . Tallulah had killed herself in October 2012 after becoming obsessed with websites glamourising self-harm and suicide. When she died, Mary was receiving treatment at The Priory clinic and was 'sad' at hearing the news of her friend's death. 'I think I wanted to safeguard her for a bit when Tallulah took her own life because Mary was in the Priory. The inquest also heard Mrs Stroman had spoken to Mary about Tallulah 's inquest in a cafe nearher Wiltshire school. Coroner David Ridley asked Mrs Stroman whether Mary appeared upset when she heard about the inquest. Mrs Stroman, who is a nurse, said she then rang the school to tell them to keep an eye on Mary as she might be upset. She said her daughter was ‘matter of fact’ about the inquest and had seemed ‘chirpy’ during a phone call the next day. 'She was quite chirpy, slightly uncharacteristically chirpy. She said she had been up to school and she was just starting her programme with the horses and she was looking forward to it. 'I had just started my new job and she asked me about that and she asked if everybody was fine.' 'After she had already died, I texted her 'goodnight'.' The inquest also heard of another incident where Mary went to railway tracks and contemplated suicide – but stopped because it was her brother's birthday. And later Mary apologised for being a 'suicidal daughter'. Mr Ridley, reading Mrs Stroman's statement, said: 'She apologised to me and said she was 'sorry that you had a suicidal daughter'. Mr Ridley told the court: 'When you were celebrating your 30th wedding anniversary in August 2010, Mary was very drunk and other people were trying to get her away from the other adults. The inquest heard Mary, pictured left and right, had a history of self-harming. At the time of her death, the teenager was living at a residential school for girls with emotional and behavioural difficulties . 'She was sick as a result of the alcohol. 'You took Mary to hospital and nurses noticed Mary had been self harming on her arms and she told the nurse she had done this before. 'She was then reported to the local community mental health team. 'You said 'she handed a knife to me and said she had been sleeping with this - we then realised we needed help and this was more serious'. 'In 2011 her doctor said Mary had been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. In September 2011 she was hearing voices in her head. 'Mary would get into a rage and she said to you 'you fucked us all up'.' The inquest also heard that Mary would often claim to have been assaulted and also wrote a letter to a friend stating she had been assaulted and raped and also had been hearing voices in her head. The teenager, who as a keen musician playing the viola and piano, was very private and did not share her worries because she was concerned about confidentiality. The coroner heard that Mary was described as a 'perfectionist' who had been a straight A student, despite her inner turmoil. Mrs Stroman said she was speaking to her daughter daily when she was living at Tumblewood Community School. 'I knew she was struggling and I know Tumblewood were trying to reach her. She didn't like the therapy but was comfortable with Dr Eastgate,' she said. 'Mary said to me there was no point in her being there as she was not being monitored and she must tell them what was wrong. I told her to talk to them but she just couldn't do it. 'I don't think in my opinion Tumblewood did anything wrong, Mary just wouldn't let anyone in to talk to her about what had happened to her. 'I spoke to Mary for about 20 minutes on the day she died. On the previous Monday I did tell her about the inquest into Tallulah had begun. Mary didn't say much about it and she sounded okay to me.' The St Marylebone School, in London, which schoolgirls Tallulah Wilson and Mary Stroman both attended . After several incidents of self-harming, she was admitted on three separate occasions to The Priory, as well as the Simmons House psychiatric unit in London. 'Mary was quite secretive. I could never stop her from self-harming completely. Her self-harming was a release for her from her anxiety - it was a coping mechanism,' Mrs Stroman said. 'She knew she needed help but throughout this was not able to disclose what happened to her. 'She couldn't take the final step to trust people with what happened. One time she said 'I am a whore, that's what I am mamma'.' Karen Briddon, a project care worker at Tumblewood Community School, went into Mary's room the day she died and found two suicide notes – one for her family and another to a friend. There was no answer and she opened the door to find a note saying 'I've gone out'. She told the inquest it was 'unusual' for Mary to leave a note because she would normally just leave. Mrs Briddon said 'alarm bells' were ringing so she carried out an internal search of her room and found the notes. One of the notes was for her family and the other was addressed to a friend. Mrs Briddon told the court she went straight to the train station. 'When I got there a message over the tannoy said trains are delayed because someone has been hit by a train,' she said. Tallulah Wilson's inquest had heard claims that she had been bullied at St Marylebone School, which she attended until the summer of 2012 before moving to St Margaret's School in Hampstead, north London, weeks before her death. Mary’s father, Scott, a musician and jazz professor, also attended the inquest at Salisbury Coroner’s Court but did not give evidence. The inquest into Mary's death continues.

"Being told that you have a life-changing injury that means you may never walk again can be a hard thing to process and explain to others, even as an adult. For children who are told that their world is about to change, and have to deal with that information, it can be more than overwhelming- it can be impossible. A world first initiative has just been introduced to help make talking about spinal cord injuries much easier for children who live with the condition much easier, all with the help from two very special heroes. Evander Conroy, 3, was born with a spinal cord injury from compression and has been in and out of hospital . The cartoon avatar commissioned by MediKidz, helps explain how spinal injuries occur and what it's like living with the condition . Evander Conroy, 3, and Izak Hassan, 10, have been transformed into cartoon superheroes for two books designed to empower children with spinal cord injuries talk about their condition, and to encourage others to open up discussions about how and why they occur. The comic books are based on the real life stories of Evander and Izak, who are all living with the effects of a spinal cord injury and are keen for their friends and family to be able to talk about spinal cord injuries in a way that isn't intimidating or confusing. Dr. Adrienne Epps, SpineCare Foundation Board Director and Head of Rehabilitation at Sydney Children’s Hospital, said that often children are marginalised or excluded because people don't know how to respond to seeing people so young in wheelchairs. 'I think it's quite challenging for children at times when they're out in the community and people stare or say ‘you poor thing’ or just don't know what to do and will turn away and not say hello.' 'Spinal cord injury is quite a hard thing to explain, and I had a lot of parents asking me why more wasn't being done for children with spinal cord injuries. They were absolutely correct,' she said. Evander, 3, (centre) with his older brother and sister . After undergoing chemotherapy in the first six months of his life, Evander has been in and out of hospitals ever since to learn how to live with his injury which has significantly impacted his mobility, and has caused other ongoing medical issues . Evander is starting preschool next year and Ms Conroy said that the books will be invaluable in helping him explain to his classmates why he is in a wheelchair . 'I think the books provide a beautiful visual resource but also having those characters, those real children as part of this framework of the book makes it more powerful and personal.' One of the children featured in the comic books, titled which have been lovingly created by the SpineCare Foundation in collaboration with Medikidz, is Evander Conroy, who was born with a spinal cord injury as the result of compression from a tumour. After undergoing chemotherapy in the first six months of his life, Evander has been in and out of hospitals ever since to learn how to live with his injury which has significantly impacted his mobility, and has caused other ongoing medical issues. Evander's mother Claire Conroy said that he is often very self-conscious when he goes out in public because he draws a lot of attention. 'He just wants to do what other kids do and doesn’t really think about it until he’s put in a situation where he can't,' she said. 'While he's grown up with an older brother and sister and is aware that they are not the same as him, we’re coming to a point where we have to talk about why he’s different and in a wheelchair and not like other kids.' Evander is starting preschool next year and Ms Conroy said that the books will be invaluable in helping him explain to his classmates why he is in a wheelchair. 'He can take it along to his class and teacher can read it to them all. It can be used as a starting point, instead of him having to explain it to them all individually,' she said. Izak Hassan, who has been living with a spinal cord injury since he was in a car accident at 14 months . ‘He gets really frustrated at school because the younger kids are always asking him why he's in a wheelchair,' said his mother Diana Hassan . 'If they get that out of the way first he can just get on with being a kid.' Dr. Epps said that the books were a way of opening up discussions not just for the children affected, but for a whole new generation of kids who would now be much more aware of the condition. 'It is about looking at effective ways of getting the message out, and explaining what spinal cord injuries are and what it's like to live with them,' she said. Ms Conroy said that Evander  had insisted they read 'his book' before bed time, and was excited to be in a comic book, as were his siblings. 'They are understanding more about why he is the way he is. It's a hard concept for his brother Orson, who is only four, and he understood that his brothers legs don’t work but figuring out why was much harder,' she said. Izak is one of five siblings, and his mother Diana said that people will often assume that because he is in a wheelchair he must have other medical conditions . The comic book avatar of Izak, in a title called 'MediKidz Explain Spinal Cord Inquiry' 'I heard him talking to Evander about the spinal cord using words in the right context. I was quite amazed that a four and a half year old would just get it the way he did.' One of the other newly minter heroes is Izak Hassan, who has been living with a spinal cord injury since he was in a car accident at 14 months. ‘He gets really frustrated at school because the younger kids are always asking him why he's in a wheelchair,' said his mother Diana Hassan. 'The books will be great because they'll educate the kids that ask and are curious. People think that if you’re in a wheelchair that there must be something else wrong with you.' Ms Hassan said that Izak doesn't often like to talk about why he's in a wheelchair, but that the books have helped his friends to celebrate him. 'He struggled with it at first because he doesn’t like talking about it, but he’s loving it now. His friends at school made a big deal and raised money for the SpineCare Foundation.' Evander's mother said that getting awareness out in the community about spinal cord injuries was crucial to increasing knowledge about the condition. 'When adults hear the words 'spinal cord injury', they immediately associate them with negative ideas,' she said. 'But he's still a child and he he doesn’t know what’s possible and what’s not. We don’t want to put any limitations on what he can achieve, with the wheelchair or without it.' 'Giving him that idea, to keep trying, keep pushing, keep searching out new possibilities, is what we want to share with him.' The two comic books, 'Evander's MediTotz Adventure' or 'MediKidz Explain Spinal Cord Injury' can be accessed for free online, in time for Spinal Injury Awareness Week (9-15 November).","Evander Conroy, 3, Izak Hassan, 10,  have been transformed into cartoon characters for two books designed to educate the community about spinal cord injuries .

"Cincinnati Bengals' defensive tackle Devon Still has revealed that his four-year-old daughter Leah, who is fighting cancer, told him she wants to become a nurse so she can help other sufferers. The football star, 25, appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday to share updates about his plucky daughter, who he says inspires him to push himself on the field. 'She's a fighter and she's going to continue to fight,' he said. Still had been cut from the Bengals earlier this year, but after Leah was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma stage 4 in June, the team re-signed him so that he could still receive a pay check and get medical insurance to pay for her treatment at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Cincinnati Bengals' Devon Still, right, appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show to update viewers about his daughter's condition. Four-year-old Leah has been undergoing treatment for Neuroblastoma . As well as backing from his own team, Still has seen support from other teams and thousands of fans who have worn his jersey - which is now the fastest selling in the Bengals' history. Speaking to Ellen from Cincinnati, he said that Leah has just finished her third round of chemotherapy, which has hit her hard but that she is continuing to battle the cancer. It's a tough time for the family, he said, but her smile keeps him going. 'I know being 10 hours away from my daughter while she's battling for her life is hard for me but I had to make the sacrifice so that my daughter could have insurance to pay for her treatment,' he said. 'Looking at pictures of her smiling... it lets me know that she's ready to fight this battle and it gives me the confidence to be out here.' He added that he has nicknamed his daughter the 'Selfie Queen' because no one can ever leave their phone alone around her without returning and finding she has taken pictures of her pulling faces. Fighter: Still shared an image of him and Leah, who has just had her third round of chemo, on Thursday . Support: Still is still playing in Cincinnati but flies to Philadelphia after his games so he can be with Leah . Side-by-side: Still shared this image of his and Leah's matching jerseys, sent to him by a New York fan. 'This whole thing has shown me how many amazing people there are in the world,' Still wrote . Although his daughter can be silly, she can also be serious, he said. 'I was actually sitting in a hospital with her two days ago and she looked up at me and she said, ""Dad I wanna be a nurse when I grow up"",' he recounted. 'And I was like, ""Where did that come from?"" She said, ""I don't know i just want to help out kids who have cancer too"".' He went on: 'She has an old soul. It's like she's been here before, she knows what her purpose is.' Ellen applauded Still for his devotion to his daughter before presenting him with a $10,000 on behalf of Shutterfly to go to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She said she was also wearing a Bengals' jersey which she and other celebrities would be signing and then putting up for auction. The money raised will also be going to the hospital, she said. 'I know that after every game you fly to Philadelphia to be with your daugter - so you're working hard and you're being by your daughter's side,' Ellen told him. 'You're an amazing guy.' Doctors have given Leah a 50 per cent chance of survival and football fans across the country have got behind her fight. Gorgeous: Still has nicknamed his daughter the 'Selfie Queen' because she always snaps photos of herself . Loved: Still's jersey is the fastest selling in Bengals history and has raised $1 million for cancer research . Fighter: Still (pictured October 5 against the Patriots) was dropped from the team but after Leah's diagnosis, they re-signed him so that he would still get a paycheck and health insurance to cover her treatment . The Bengals have said all proceeds from the sale of Still's jersey, number 75, will go toward pediatric cancer research. So far more than $1 million has been raised. Even competing teams and sports are showing their support by snapping up some of their rival's shirts, with the Bengals thanking the New Orleans Saints for buying 100 jerseys earlier this week. The Yankees ticket staff posed for a massive group photo showing them wearing the jersey, while cheerleaders for the New England Patriots all donned the jersey last week. Ever since Leah's diagnosis, Still has shared images on Instagram showing her dancing in the hospital and grinning as she undergoes treatment. The proud father, who is engaged, has also shaved his head in support of his daughter, who has lost her hair to her treatment.","Devon Still's daughter Leah was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma in June .

"The best-preserved woolly mammoth ever found has gone on display in central Moscow some 39,000 years after it last roamed the Earth. The ancient baby woolly mammoth, named Yuka by scientists, was found by local tusk hunters in the Yakutia region of Russia's Arctic coast in 2010. Remarkably clumps of the animal’s distinguishing hair are still intact after the baby mammoth was trapped in glacial ice until she was found. Display: Adults and children gather in Moscow, Russia to look at the display of the baby woolly mammoth . Experts have said the discovery of Yuka is a significant find because her body is unusually well-preserved in comparison to previous discoveries of mammoth corpses. Yury Burlakov, a member  of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Reuters there were numerous reasons why the five corpses of mammoths previously found had not been as significant. Hair: Clumps of the animal’s distinguishing hair are still intact 39,000 years after it was alive . Significant: Yuka has been described as a sensational find as the corpse is in very well preserved . 'Five corpses of baby-mammoths, small mammoths have been found. Why is it interesting? [The] Mammoth is huge, three metres tall, weighs five tonnes, and we usually do not get to see it complete,' Mr Burlakov said. 'Either predators have gnawed on it after its death or something else. This baby-mammoth is comparatively small, so certain fragile details are preserved, like the trunk or the tail.' The scientists have identified scars on the body of the three-metre long female which they say confirm that she was the victim of predators before her death. Yuka was discovered in permanently frozen soil and ice and since then the body of the woolly mammoth has been kept in a special glass cage at freezing temperatures. Trunk: Scientist Yury Burlakov said it is unusual to see the complete corpse of a mammoth . Display: The baby mammoth is now on display in Moscow, Russia after previously visiting Japan and Taiwan . Experts believe the now extinct mammoth was approximately 10 years-old when she died. Stanislav Kolesov, research associate of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said the extraordinary discovery was significant breakthrough for science. Unique: Experts believe Yuka the mammoth was around 10 years-old when she died . Ideal age: Mr Kolesov said the previous corpses found were adults or very young babies, under one year of age . 'She has great value for science, because she is the only baby-mammoth of its age category. She is a teenager, nine or ten-years-old. Mammoths of this age had not yet been found. There were adults or very young babies, under one year of age,' Mr Kolesov said. 'And besides it is a sensational discovery, as her brain has preserved very well.' The baby woolly mammoth is visiting Moscow as part of a world tour. The prehistoric creature has already been on display in Japan and Taiwan. It is believed the last woolly mammoth walked the earth around 4,000 years ago.","Corpse was found in the Yakutia region of Russia's Arctic coast in 2010 .

"Parents have been urged to replace a child car seat after it failed safety tests and was branded dangerous. Consumer group Which? has issued an alert to warn all parents about the danger of the seat, which was on sale online and at Argos, after it scored zero in safety tests. It said they had found a 'serious failing' when the seat was put through crash tests, during which parts of it were ripped off. In a real crash the child would be at risk of colliding with the seat in front because of the failure of parts of the seat. Argos, which sold the car seat, said the seat had been removed from its catalogue in July, but a small amount of remaining stock would still be sold as the seat passes standard European safety tests. Scroll down for video . The Babystart car seat failed the safety tests done by Which? and scored zero in one of the trials carried out . Which? safety tests are more stringent than the standard European tests - including a 'slide test' and a front-on crash at a higher speed. The Babystart multi-recline child seat was previously on sale for £35. A spokesman from Which? said: 'If you own this seat, or know anybody who has this seat, we advise you to replace it as soon as possible due to a serious failing we uncovered in our car seat crash testing.' The seat has passed official EU regulatory tests to be sold as suitable for children from birth up to 18kg, and was marked as ECE R44/04 approved. The car seat is no longer being produced but Argos confirmed it was still selling any existing stock it had as it had met the standard European safety regulations. A spokeswoman said: 'As the product meets all of the required safety regulations we have not removed the remaining stock from sale.' Which? said second-hand products are available on websites such as Gumtree and Ebay and advised against buying the seat or any second-hand car seats. The Which? front crash tests are carried out at 40mph, rather than 30mph, and these caused the shoulder parts of the seat to break off . When the seat was facing forward and subjected to a front crash test the plastic seat shell did not withstand the crash and the harness came away as the plastic broke. The crash test dummy was not restrained properly and it scored 0 . The car seat failed the Which? safety tests . The assessment also includes a slide impact crash test, which the seat still scored poorly for . The seat was marginally better when it was facing backwards, but still only scored 33 per cent . Which? tests child car seats in a real car body, not on a sledge with a car bench seat fixed to it. This makes the fixing points for seatbelts more realistic . The seat scored the lowest ever test score of zero per cent in the more demanding, independent crash tests, which are conducted at higher speeds and forces than the current UK standards require. Which? branded the seat a ‘don’t buy’ because the shoulder parts of the harness were ripped out of the plastic seat shell as it broke under the force of the crash tests. If this were to happen in a real-life crash, a child would collide with the seat in front, with just the lap part of the belt keeping them attached to the car seat. Argos no longer lists this particular seat in its catalogue. But it does sell a range of other Babystart car seats on its website. As well as pushchairs, highchairs, baby carriers and equipment produced by the company. The tests, carried out by the test laboratory of the German car club ADAC, are well-respected for how they have contributed to improving the standard of child car seat safety over the last decade. Any child car seat marked as approved to ECE R44/04 is better than no car seat at all and will provide some protection in a crash, but the results indicate that a child using the Babystart Multi-Recline car seat in Group 1 mode, reclined, would be at risk of serious injury in the simulated crashes. The seat is not on Argos' current list of recalls but Which? said production has stopped. A spokeswoman at Argos said: 'Customer safety is our top priority and we were extremely concerned to hear of the issues raised in the Which? Report regarding the BabyStart Multi Recline Car Seat. 'Following an internal investigation alongside our supplier TeamTex, we can confirm that we have had no issues or customer complaints in relation to this product. 'The BabyStart range is sold exclusively at Argos and we stopped selling this particular car seat in July as part of our normal new range process, however a small number of car seats are still available.'","Babystart multi-recline child seat has been branded dangerous by testers .

"An eager NOFX fan who jumped on stage to hug Fat Mike got more than he bargained for when he was slammed to the ground by the lead singer. Sydney local Alex Medak attended the band's Sydney show on Tuesday night, when he decided it would be a good idea to invade the stage and grab a moment with his favourite rocker. However, Mike Burkett aka 'Fat Mike' had been complaining of neck pain throughout the show and didn't take too kindly to the Alex's stage dash. Scroll down for video . An eager NOFX fan who jumped on stage to hug Fat Mike got more than he bargained for when he was slammed to the ground by the lead singer . Alex managed to slip past security and approach the singer from the left-hand side of the stage. In the video, unwitting NOFX fan Alex can be seen sneaking up behind Fat Mike and throwing his left arm around the unassuming American rocker. Within seconds, Mike turns around, pushing the stage invader's arm away from him and punching him directly in the face. Alex immediately falls to the floor from the sheer force of the punch. Sydney local Alex Medak attended the band's Sydney show on Tuesday night when he decided it would be a good idea to invade the stage and grab a moment with his favourite rocker . The red-haired punk singer then proceeds to kick Alex in the face while he is still lying on the floor. Security guards surround the Sydney man while Mike calmy goes back to entertaining the audience. The enthusiastic fan took to his Twitter account to reveal himself as the scorned fan, posting a message to the Suits and Ladders vocalist's personal page. '@FatMike_of_NOFX thanks for the KO mike, didn't hurt too much. Soz for creepin up on you like, punk shows are a bit different down here,' Alex said. Fat Mike didn't take too kindly to the stage invasion and punched Alex in the face causing him to slam onto the ground. Mike then kicked out at him while he was on the ground . In an unprecedented move, Fat Mike replied to the star, apologising for his uncharacteristically violent behaviour and offering to buy the fan a beer. 'I'm sorry too Alex, I was in terrible pain all night. When you grabbed me by the neck I defensively reacted... offensively @alexanderpeterq,' Alex replied to the singer, claiming he has drank far too much alcohol that night and he was to blame for the event and urged his Twitter followers to 'calm down'.

In reply, Mike's tour member Stephen Garret got in contact with Alex on Twitter, claiming he would add his name to Friday night's guest list. 'Come back and find me. We will have a better night tomorrow!' Mr Garret tweeted to Alex. One fan who was following the conversation on the social media page, expressed his disgust at Fat Mike's actions. Stage invader Alex Medak took to Twitter to diffuse the situation, telling his following to 'calm down' James A Barron II said: ' i used to admire fatmike b4 i saw him to that to a fan,' 'Don't blame him. He said his neck was in pain and I still went up and obviously hurt him,' Alex Medak said in reply. Other users were wary of the supposed fan, calling him out on the fact that he only created a Twitter account to tweet the NOFX frontman. Alex replied, showing a picture of his swollen lip and holding up his NOFX ticket. Alex posted a picture to his Twitter account to verify his identity. He held up his concert ticket and displayed his bust lip . 'not a fake account, heres photo of my swollen lip and in what i wore,' he said.

"Princes William and Harry may have become the poster boys of the Royal family but it's their grandfather who is considered a God in a remote South Pacific island. Prince Philip is  worshipped in the tiny village of Vanuatu, where villagers believe the Queen's 93-year-old husband descended from their spirit ancestors. Villagers created the theory after meeting the Duke of Edinburgh on his visit there back in 1974 and this weekend saw Prince Philip's daughter, Princess Anne, return to Vanuatu. Royal visit: Her Royal Highness The Princes Royal arrived in Vanuatu yesterday, where she was welcomed by delegates at the Duke of Edinburgh's Commonwealth Study Conference' s Pacific programme . The 64-year-old Princess Royal, who was also on the trip forty years ago, yesterday landed in Vanuatu's capital Port Vila, where she will be spending five days working. Princess Anne is president of Emerging Pacific Leaders Dialogue, which, according to its website, aims to strengthen the capacity of the region’s future leaders to manage challenges collaboratively, positively and creatively. God: Sikor Natuan, the son of the local chief, holds two official portraits of Prince Philip in the remote village of Yaohnanen on Tanna in Vanuatu. For in the South Pacific village of Yaohnanen on Vanuatu's Tanna island,  Prince Philip is worshipped as a god . Praised: Sikor Natuan, the son of the local chief, holds a water damaged portrait of Prince Philip in a partially built monument to the British royal near the remote village of Yaohnanen on Tanna in Vanuatu . Local tribesmen believe he is the son of a mountain spirit and promised the people he would one day return to visit them - they hold a feast every year to celebrate his birthday and eagerly await his arrival. He may not have ventured back to the island, which is 9,834 miles from London, but Prince Philip regularly sends letters and pictures to the tribesmen. He even wrote a letter of condolence in 2009 when the tribe's leader, Chief Jack Naiva, passed away. Remote: Local tribesmen in Vanuatu, pictured, believe he is the son of a mountain spirit and promised the people he would one day return to visit them . Local life: He may not have ventured back to the island, which is 9,834 miles from London, but Prince Philip regularly sends letters and pictures to the tribesmen who live there . Meanwhile, it's been a busy few weeks for Anne, who arrived in Brisbane on Tuesday morning ahead of an international agricultural conference. The Princess Royal attended the 26th Royal Agricultural Society of the Commonwealth (RASC) at the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland (RNA). Princess Anne touched down at Brisbane airport on Tuesday morning to attend the conference which aims to share ideas about agriculture, food, and the natural environments of members of the Commonwealth. It runs for four days and HRH The Princess Royal will be attending for the entirety of the conference. Busy bee: Princess Anne landed in the South Pacific island fresh from a visit to Australia. Here, she is seen in Burpengary, north of Brisbane, on Thursday . The RASC was founded in 1957 by The Duke of Edinburgh Prince Phillip, and he was President of the society for half a century. Princess Anne then took over the role. The President of the RNA David Thomas is also the current vice-president of the RASC, and told the Brisbane Times his role means he has met the Princess Royal on many occasions. 'I think Princess Anne has always been a popular royal, she's very hard-working,' he told the publication. 'I think she's one of those people who are very approachable; my dealings with her have been completely delightful.'

"Dr Pam says she is seeing more and more childless women being taken advantage of by their friends with children . Not a week goes by these days without a story about fertility. We know that many women choose to have children later in life these days and of course that many others simply decide that motherhood is not for them. But, have you ever noticed just how many mums will call upon their childless friends and relatives to look after their children - often thinking it's okay to ask them to do so at the drop of a hat? I have. I'm really quite staggered by some of the mothers I've met who downright take advantage of the childless women in their lives to babysit for them - repeatedly and at a moment's notice - and to play auntie to their children. Take a 40-something entrepreneur I met recently at a conference. Impeccably dressed and obviously a successful businesswoman we got talking about juggling careers with children. She described how she’d never had to worry about hiring a nanny seeing as her business is operated online from her home-based office. Plus she had an old friend who’d never had children and has always stepped in for babysitting duties. Nothing remarkable in that you might think, but then she then spouted on about how this friend had never seemed to realise that she was a bit taken advantage of. In fact this mother enthused about how there could be nothing better than a practically built-in babysitter you could absolutely trust. She said her friend had never met ‘the one’ to have children and evidently craved a sense of being loved by children. Apparently she’d drop any plans just to have some of that precious feeling that Stella’s children needed her. I didn’t press her on any guilty feelings she might have over this situation because clearly she had none. And increasingly I've been struck by the number of times I've come across this rather sad state of affairs perhaps because I’m coming across more childless women - and the mothers all too willing to take advantage. With women postponing having children until much later, fertility issues have been an unfortunate and heart-breaking side-effect for many. Dr Pam says that many mothers are aware of the fact that they are taking advantage of their friends when they ask them to baby sit . Yes, of course many childless women – who wanted children - come to terms with this and lead completely fulfilled lives but there are those who are quite desperate to be part of their friends’ children's lives. Some want to feel the children they volunteer to look after will love them back. Thus fulfilling some sense of maternal-child love by proxy. You might argue it doesn't matter because both women are getting something from these arrangements. However I do think it matters when a mother knows full well what she's doing when taking advantage of a childless friend. And if said friend knew the mother cared less about their friendship and more about having a babysitter on-tap (that is free and trustworthy) the childless friend would probably feel deeply hurt. Take one client, I’ll call Cathy, who told me how a childless friend was a ""soft touch"" (her words). Since Cathy's divorce she's left her two children with this friend for entire weekends so she could spend them with her new boyfriend. Cathy didn't seem to have many scruples about taking advantage in this way. Because I was coaching her on better communication in relationships I pressed Cathy on the dynamics of this relationship. Did her friend realise she was incredibly convenient for Cathy, did Cathy feel she received more from this babysitting arrangement than her friend, and so on. Dr Pam's book gives advice on how to deal with unhappy relationships . Our conversation struck a nerve and Cathy seemed to wake up to the fact her friend was important to her and she’d be a little more selective about asking for favours and more respectful of their relationship. Other women have in passing recounted tales of their childless friends who will do anything to spend time with their children. It can at times seem utterly selfish and a one-way street. No one would want to feel they were being used in this way, especially a woman who has already experienced a great sense of loss over being childless. In my own experience one of my closest friends chose to remain childless as her career involves lots of travel. Career always came first for her and she’s been a wonderful presence in my children's lives. But I would never have considered taking advantage of her good will. And, as I said, it was Anna’s choice not to have children so she's hardly what you'd call 'desperate to look after children'. I know there are other mothers who would never take advantage in this way, but I’m not concerned with them here. Ultimately these relationships should be a level playing field, the ground rules should be fair. No childless woman should ever be taken advantage of in this way. My advice to childless women is don’t feel you have to drag yourself from pillar to post to be an on-tap, unpaid babysitter. Yes, absolutely enjoy the time you have with your friends’ children but make sure it’s an equitable, fair relationship. To the mothers who might put a guilty conscience on hold just to get that free babysitting I say how would you feel being taken advantage of in this way? Can you treat your friend with more respect? What can you do for them in return? And consider how you’d feel if you lost their friendship if they caught on to the fact you have little respect for their needs. Happy, balanced relationships benefit all concerned. Pam Spurr is the author of The Emotional Eater’s Diet .

"Greeted by crowds of delighted flag-waving children, it was a bittersweet moment for the Duchess of Cornwall as she arrived at a school once attended by her late brother Mark Shand today. The Duchess, who was there to unveil a memorial to the late conservationist, was left devastated by his untimely death in New York earlier this year. Mr Shand had been due to return to Saint Ronan’s School in Hawkhurst, Kent, to talk about his work as a conservationist and tell the children about his elephant charity but died before  making the trip. Scroll down for video . Proud: A beaming Duchess of Cornwall arrives to meet pupils at Saint Ronan's School in Kent . Cheers: The Duchess was greeted by cheering pupils as she arrived to unveil a memorial to her late brother . Looking around: The Duchess was given a tour of the school by headmaster, William Trelawny-Vernon . He had attended the £5,300 a term Kent prep school from the age of eight in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Mr Shand, who was 62, died after slipping and hitting his head on a pavement outside the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan last April. Along with the Prince of Wales, Camilla was left distraught by the loss of her brother and was pictured looking tearful in the days following his death and at the funeral. Despite her grief at the loss of her brother, the Duchess was all smiles as she met current pupils and their headmaster, William Trelawny-Vernon. Elegant in a pinstripe grey suit and black boots, accessorised with a matching pair of diamond lapel pins, the Duchess was every inch the royal style icon as she was shown around the school. But glamorous though she looked, for Camilla, the real highlight of the visit was trip to the astro-turf pitch currently being built that will be named 'Shand-Ba' in memory of the late Mr Shand. Happy childhood: Camilla (far right) aged four with her brother Mark Shand and sister Annabel as children . Happier times: Camilla with her brother Mark Shand at an event at the Connaught Hotel in London . Memories: Camilla's brother Mark Shand attended the school as a boy between 1959 and 1964 . Enjoying the tour: Camilla was also introduced to current pupils and was shown into different lessons . Top tips: Among those to meet Camilla were these two boys who were in the middle of a technology lesson . Many of Mr Shand's former classmates were in attendance as the Duchess toured the school, stopping in the dormitory once used by her brother and in the chapel where he used to pray. His nephew Luke Irwin was also there and said that his uncle’s years at St Ronan’s were 'idyllic and the happiest of his scholastic life'. He added: 'I miss him so much but I do know that nothing would have given him greater pleasure or a higher honour than having a pitch at St Ronan’s named after him. It will be a day the children will remember and we are very honoured.' For her part, Camilla, who last night presented the Man Booker prize to Australia's Richard Flanagan, has often spoken of her love for her brother and even penned an article  in which she remembered their happy childhood and his love of animals. 'We were lucky children; we spent an idyllic childhood living in Sussex under the South Downs,' she wrote in the piece, which was published in the Times ahead of a London memorial service for Mr Shand. Devastated: Camilla was left desolate by the death of her brother, who once attended Saint Ronan's School . Touching moment: She was also shown an old school photo of her brother Mark, who died last April . There he is: Mr Shand is seen in the photo, taken when he was 12, seated in the middle row, second from left . Memories: The Duchess visited the school chapel and was shown photos of her brother as a schoolboy . All smiles: The Duchess appeared to enjoy her visit, in particular meeting the excited pupils . Tribute: The Duchess in front of the school's new pitch, currently being built, which will be called Shand-Ba . Excited: Pupils at the school, which caters for children aged between three and 13, were thrilled by the visit . And she's off! Pupils at the school wave as the helicopter carrying the Duchess of Cornwall takes off . 'It was happily before the advent of political correctness and health and safety, to neither of which Mark in his later life ever conformed. 'He metamorphosised from rather a bad-tempered, fat child into a golden boy, blessed with good looks, charm and a ""devil may care"" attitude to life.' The Duchess also spoke of her determination to ensure Mr Shand's conservation work continues and said both she and the Prince of Wales would do their best to uphold his legacy. 'They say that elephants never forget,' she concluded. 'Tara [Mr Shand's elephant] never forgot him and neither will we…' All smiles: After the visit to Saint Ronan's School, Camilla was whisked off to the Chapel Down Winery . Tasty: Camilla gets up close and personal with a bunch of grapes before preparing to try the wine itself . Bottoms up! The Duchess of Cornwall samples a glass of Cuvée Camilla, the winery's newest vintage . Following the visit to the school, Camilla, who is president of the United Kingdom Vineyards Association, was taken to see the Chapel Down Winery in the nearby village of Tenterden. There, she was shown the vines, many of which were still bursting with grapes, and sampled some of the finished product. The delighted Duchess of Cornwall was also presented with a magnum of the vineyard's newest vintage, Cuvée Camilla.

"A terminal cancer sufferer has managed to grow rare Japanese bananas in his Devon back garden. Paul Edis, 54, and his wife Srey-March, 32, planted a Musa basjoo tree - which originates from Japan’s remote Ryukyu Islands - in Plymouth, but it remained dormant for four years. However, as Britain enjoyed one of its longest, warmest summers and driest Septembers on record, the plant burst into life - shooting up to 15ft tall and producing juicy bananas for the first time. Achievement: Paul and Srey-March Edis have grown rare Japanese bananas in their garden in Plymouth, Devon . Fruit: Bananas are fruiting in Mr Edis's garden in Devon. He buried the plant on 4ft of decaying autumn leaves . Mr Edis, a decorated Royal Navy veteran, tried twice before to grow banana trees but said they died out in the harsh winters. This time he buried the plant on 4ft of decaying autumn leaves. But he said the latest growth was thanks to prayer, adding: ‘I was sitting next to my beloved banana tree and said that if the Lord was up there, looking down at me, to give me a sign. ‘Within a week we had our first flower. I think it’s spiritual. The heat from the leaves kept it alive. No one I know has heard of a banana tree being grown in someone’s garden. We get a lot of people coming to see it.’ Mrs Edis, who has two sons with her husband - Deano, four, and Rio, two - now uses the bananas to cook authentic cuisine from her native Cambodia where they are used for both food and medicine. Mr Edis - a former shopkeeper who sold his business after being diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus, stomach and liver - added: ‘They lay the leaves on the ground to prepare food on. Food: Yellow bean cakes which Mr Edis has been making with the banana leaves from his front garden . Success: Mr Edis, 54, tried twice before to grow banana trees but said they died out in the harsh winters . ‘They use it for cooking, wrapping food in it. They use the bark for fires, and the plant for medicines, especially upset stomachs. And of course the bananas are a source of food and nutrition.’ Experts at Cornwall’s Eden Project attraction have confirmed the plant is almost certainty a Musa basjoo, also known as a ‘Japanese banana’ or ‘hardy banana’. It is typically grown in southern China, with vast wild populations found in Sichuan province, and parts of Canada and the US. Hetty Ninnis, Eden’s rainforest biome team lead, said: ‘It’s a type that is quite hardy. We grow it here at Eden in the outdoor biome. ‘If you can find a nice south-facing sheltered spot, protect from frost and feed them well they can be grown very successfully down this way. ‘This looks like a lovely healthy specimen. The sap is good for treating burns, a bit like aloe vera. Leaves are used in some other traditional medicines.’ Good weather: It comes as experts revealed September was warmer than August across parts of the UK . New recipes: Mrs Edis now uses the bananas to cook authentic cuisine from her native Cambodia where they are used for both food and medicine . Mr Edis spent 26 years in the Navy, being awarded five medals for serving in the Falklands, Gulf and Adriatic wars. His horticultural feat comes as experts revealed September was warmer than August across parts of the UK. The Central England Temperature of 15.3C was 1.2C above the mean for 1981-2010, making the month - rarely - warmer than August, said weather historian Philip Eden. It was the warmest September since 2006, and in the last 100 years only three Septembers were warmer, two had the same mean temperature, while 95 were cooler. Separately, the Met Office said it was set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910, with exceptionally low rainfall for many parts of the country.","Paul Edis planted tree which originates from Japan's remote Ryukyu Islands .

"Grammy-winning singer Erykah Badu took to the streets of New York - and only earned $3.60 from busking for less than an hour. A video directed by Badu herself, called 'Street Hustle Experiment,' reportedly shows her singing for money last Friday evening on West 42nd Street in Manhattan. 'Peace and light, New York,' she says at the start of the video. 'This is Erykah Badu, and I'm in your city. I'm in your city.' Scroll down for video . Busking: Singer Erykah Badu busked for money in New York City, placing her hat on the ground for money . Anonymous: Badu received $3.60 in donations during her busking 'Street Hustle Experiment' 'I just kind of always wanted to see what it would be like to you know, sing for money on the streets,' she explains. 'So what I'm going to do is I'm going to is find a good place and I want to find a good place. I'm trying to find a good place to stop and do it.' When someone asks her 'May I take a picture of you?' before the busking starts, Badu yells 'Beat it, I'm trying to do something.' 'I know but I want to take a picture,' the person is heard saying. Badu later says 'Okay' then smiles for the picture taker, who says 'Thank you, Ms. Badu, you're beautiful.' Badu then says the  person is beautiful too before getting back to the experiment. Badu then decides to take off her hat to make it difficult to recognize her - and sets it down for people to make donations while she sings a cappella. Wearing multiple gold chains and elaborate rings on her fingers, Badu sings 'Please sir, give me some money. Sister, I need some money. Can you give me some money?' Watch the full video here . Determined: Badu later held out her hat as she walked around and sang about needing money . 'Haven't sold a record in about two years, yeah, haven't sold a record in a long time, b**** needs some money,' she continues. Later in the video, dozens of people are seen walking past Badu singing on the street as she raises out her hands. 'I don't want to get no real job, I just want to be out here selling my songs, yeah,' Badu sings at one point. Badu eventually walks around holding out her hat, as she sings and asks for donations. 'I don't want to get no job, lady I just want your money, yeah girl,' she sings in the clip. 'Ah! Got some money!' Badu yells as the first woman puts a coin in her hat about four minutes into her efforts at busking. She is later seen through crows of people, singing and asking for donations. After '41 1/2 minutes' allegedly pass, Badu counts her earnings and finds a grand total of $3.60. 'See, if you got some initiative, you can make money,' Badu says. Walking along, she says she is now able to buy possibly a juice or a sorbet.","A video called 'Street Hustle Experiment' reportedly shows Badu singing for money last Friday evening on West 42nd Street in Manhattan .

"While death camp wardens and Gestapo officers were being tried at Nuremberg in the aftermath of World War II, the U.S. was putting other former Nazis on the payroll. It has been revealed through recently disclosed government documents and interviews that at least 1,000 ex-Nazis were recruited by the American military, FBI and CIA to become Cold War spies and informants, the New York Times reports. Not only did they hire former Third Reich members suspected of carrying out war crimes, they went so far as to help their spies immigrate to the U.S. and cover up their involvement in the war in an attempt to protect them from the U.S. Justice Department's own Nazi hunters. And that estimate is considered conservative by the historians who were tasked by the government to declassify the war-crime records. Scroll down for video . Working for us: It has been revealed that at least 1,00 former Nazi police officials and collaborators were recruited by the FBI and CIA in the aftermath of World War II to become Cold War spies for the U.S. Above, Adolph Hitler greets SS officers at his birthday on April 20, 1937 . 'U.S. agencies directly or indirectly hired numerous ex-Nazi police officials and East European collaborators who were manifestly guilty of war crimes,' University of Florida historian Norman Goda told the Times. 'Information was readily available that these were compromised men.' Records reveal that these spies and informants were recruited from every level of the fallen Nazi regime, from SS officers to Adolf Eichmann's own mentor and 'master race' proselytizer. In the 1950s, at the height of the Cold War, longtime FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and CIA Chief Allen Dulles were in agreement that these former Nazis would be more helpful to the U.S. as Soviet spies than in prison. In Maryland, Army officials trained Nazi officers for a possible invasion of Russia while in Connecticut an ex-Nazi guard was hired to study Soviet-bloc postage stamps for possible hidden messages. In Virginia, a former top adviser to Hitler himself gave classified briefings on the Soviets while ex-SS officers living in  East Germany lay surveillance cables and tracked train movements. However, the records also showed that many of these former Nazis ended up not being effective spies, and some were even double agents. One of the more senior Nazis recruited by the U.S. was Aleksandras Lileikis, who was connected to the mass murder of 60,000 Jews in a Lithuanian ghetto. War criminal: The CIA knew of Aleksandras Lileikis' possible connection to the mass murder of Jews in Vilna, Lithuania, but they hired him anyway to become a spy in East Germany in 1952. Four years later they helped him move to the U.S. (his immigration picture on the right) Above, a view of the ghetto in Vilna, Lithuania where nearly 60,000 Jews stayed before their deportation to death camps . Lileikis also worked for the CIA after the war, and the agency even wrote in documents their knowledge of his war crimes. They wrote that Lileikis worked 'under the control of the Gestapo during the war' and that he 'was possibly connected with the shooting of Jews in Vilna'. Lileikis was hired to spy in East Germany in 1952, and the agency paid him $1,700 a year and eventually helped him immigrate to the U.S. four years later. He lived here for forty years before he was discovered in 1994 living outside Boston, and prosecutors moved to put to deport him. A CIA lawyer called the Justice Department telling them 'you can't file this case.' The CIA and Justice Department allegedly came to an agreement that Lileikis would not be put on trial if the agency turned over their evidence showing the former Nazi was turned into a U.S. spy. Ultimately, they let Lileikis get deported before making public their embarrassing past of hiring ex-Nazis. And even though they wrote about his involvement in the liquidation of the Vilna ghetto in internal memos, their official comment was that they were not aware of any war crimes. 'There is no evidence, that this Agency was aware of his wartime activities,' the CIA said in a 1995 statement. Another senior Nazi turned-American-spy was Otto von Bolschwing, who was a mentor and top aide to Adolph Eichmann - one of the masterminds of the Holocaust. Despite writing papers on how to terrorize Jews, the CIA hired Bolschwing as a spy in Europe and eventually  moved his family to New York City in 1954 as 'a reward for his loyal postwar service and in view of the innocuousness of his [Nazi] party activities'. But when Eichmann was captured living in Argentina in 1960, Bolschwing feared he too would be exposed and put on trial as a conspirator with the creator of the 'Final Solution'. The CIA however reassured Bolschwing that they would protect him, and he did live freely in the U.S. for another 20 years before Nazi hunters tracked him down and moved to deport him from the country. Bolschwing agreed to give up his citizenship in 1981, and he died a few months later. Bolschwing's son, 75-year-old Gus Von Bolschwiung, is critical of his father's post-war counter-intelligence career. 'They used him, and he used them,' Gus von Bolschwing told the Times. 'It shouldn’t have happened. He never should have been admitted to the United States. It wasn’t consistent with our values as a country' None of these ex-Nazi spies are known to be alive today. Eichmann's man: Otto von Bolschwing (left) was a mentor and top aide to Adolph Eichmann (right), one of the masterminds of the Holocaust. He was hired by the U.S. to spy in Europe in the aftermath of World War II. He lived in the U.S. for more than two decades before he was discovered by Nazi hunters and deported .","Newly disclosed government records indicate the CIA and FBI ignored potential war crimes when they hired these ex-Nazis in the 1950s and 1960s .

"Some 700,000 children in England aged five to 17 will be offered the treatment (picture posed by model) Pupils will be vaccinated with a nasal spray this winter in a bid to stop the spread of flu. Some 700,000 children in England aged five to 17 will be offered the treatment in what will be the biggest school immunisation pilot for 30 years. Last year, the spray – called Fluenz – was offered to all children aged two and three but this year it will also be pitched to parents of all four-year-olds. And Public Health England (PHE) will trial the larger programme in primary and secondary schools to immunise pupils. Dr Nick Phin, head of flu at PHE, said: ‘This is an ambitious campaign but with good reason, because studies have shown children are “superspreaders” of the flu virus. When they sneeze, they often won’t have a handkerchief or wash their hands, and protecting them will help to protect their parents, siblings and grandparents. ‘The pilot of 700,000 schoolchildren is to identify and iron out any issues we may have with the programme.’ Although for most people flu is an unpleasant inconvenience, for others it can be deadly. Flu contributed to an estimated 8,000 deaths in England last year, mostly thought to be the elderly or infirm, or those with conditions such as asthma. Dr Paul Cosford, medical director at PHE, described the spray as a ‘quick, easy and painless’ way to prevent children catching flu and spreading it to others who are more vulnerable. He added: ‘People with certain long-term health conditions are at much greater risk of becoming seriously unwell if they catch flu and sadly, many end up in hospital.’ The Government is today launching a major campaign to encourage adults to take advantage of the free flu jab. Pregnant women, parents of young children and those with health problems are among those being targeted by officials. Last year only half of those eligible for the injection took up the offer. The Government’s chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said: ‘I would urge those offered the free flu vaccination to visit their GP early in the flu season.’ The school nasal spray vaccination pilot is being run by 12 local authorities in the North East, the Midlands, Yorkshire, East Anglia and Sussex. Parents will receive letters inviting them to let their children receive Fluenz from the school nurse. Doctors think the nasal spray has great potential to encourage uptake among children averse to needles. However, it costs twice as much as the flu jab, with the cost of immunising all children in England estimated to be £100million a year. The last time there was such a large-scale school immunisation pilot here was in 1984 when the BCG was introduced to fight TB.","Pupils aged five to 17 will be offered nasal spray treatment called Fluenz .

"The proportion of people living in northern England has slumped to its lowest level in 200 years, as millions flock to the south in search of work. A new study today revealed just 27.9 per cent of people live in the North West, North East or Yorkshire and Humber. The last time as smaller share of the population lived there was in 1811. It also shows the northern economy is underperforming, with less growth, lower productivity, more reliance on the public sector and shorter life expectancy. Just 27.9 per cent of people live in the North West, North East or Yorkshire and Humber. The last time as smaller share of the population lived there was in 1811, at 27.3 per cent . Young people move to the north to study at university, but flock south in their twenties in search of graduate job opportunities . Chancellor George Osborne this week vowed to build a 'Northern Powerhouse' between the great cities of the north. And tomorrow Deputy PM Nick Clegg will host a Northern Futures Summit in Leeds to asses how the area can 'compete with the biggest cities and regions in the world'. But the data from the Office for National Statistics shows the scale of the challenge, with the north slipping behind the rest of England. It means millions of especially young people leave each year to find a job and a better life. The proportion of people living in north peaked in the early 1900s, at the height of the industrial revolution, but has been falling since. The ONS said: 'Historically, the North’s share of the English population has been declining since the early 20th century. 'During the industrialisation of the 19th century the North’s share of the population grew, meeting the labour requirements of the factories and mills in the North of England.' Since 1997, average annual economic growth has been higher in the rest of England than in the north, even when London is excluded . The north is more reliant on the public sector than the rest of the country, and has suffered more with the impact of public spending cuts . There are fewer business per 10,000 people in the north, with the economy struggling to keep pace . Men and women both have lower life expectancy in the north than in the rest of the country . The north’s share of England’s population peaked around 1911 at 36.5 per cent. Since 1911, the population share has fallen and in 2013 was 27.9 per cent, a return to the share last seen in 1821. Today 15.1million people live in the north, up 762,000 since 2001, but the population of the rest of country has grown more quickly. Northern universities attract students from the rest of England but after graduating the gains are reversed when they head southwards in their twenties. In 2013, 11,623 more people aged 18-20 moved to the North from the rest of England than journeyed the other way, the ONS said. In the 21-30 age group, 23,831 more moved southwards than northwards. This is in part the result of 'less favourable labour market conditions', in particular a lack of job opportunities for graduates in the North. Unemployment has been higher in the north for the last two decades, and was harder hit by the downturn . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today announced £15million to boost tourism to the north of England . The employment rate in the north has been lower than the rest of the country for the last two decades, with the north’s labour market being 'hit relatively harder by the downturn'. The ONS added: 'When compared with the rest of England, the latest data show that the North underperforms on several economic and social indicators. 'Its shares of economic output, jobs and household income fall below its share of the population. It has lower labour productivity. 'Life expectancy is shorter and average reported happiness is slightly lower than the rest of England. 'The North also experienced slower economic growth than the rest of England over the 1997 to 2012 period.' However the economic powerhouse of London distorts the figures. Excluding the capital, the gap between growth rates in the North of England and the other English regions was smaller. Today the government announced an extra £10million to draw up a tourism strategy for the north. Mr Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said: 'It’s absurd that our great north is missing out on visitors when it boasts such stunning countryside, history and culture. 'Through the Northern Futures project, I asked people what our northern cities needed in order to compete globally, and to grow.'","27.9% of people live in the North West, North East or Yorkshire and Humber .

"A doctor who has been treating victims of Ebola in Africa says the sheer number of those affected and the fear it instilled in people was shocking and 'quite alarming'. Dr Jenny Stedmon returned to her Brisbane home last week after spending a harrowing month as a specialist volunteer with the Red Cross in a tent-based facility in Kanama, Sierra Leone. The 55-year-old anaesthetist, who is now in quarantine for 21 days, helped set up a new Ebola isolation facility to help ease pressure on the hugely overcrowded hospitals. Scroll down for video . Dr Jenny Stedmon returned to her Brisbane home last week after spending a harrowing month as a specialist volunteer with the Red Cross in Kanama, Sierra Leone . Dr Stedmon, pictured left organising clothes for patients, watched 70 per cent of her patients die due in part to a lack of intensive care facilities and even basic sanitation . 'I'm an anaesthetist used to working with very high tech equipment. In Africa I was giving very basic care and that's all you're able to do,' Dr Stedmon told Daily Mail Australia. 'You're not able to give intensive care treatment, the most you can do is give them fluids. You can't put people on life support. 'The situation was overwhelming from the local health point of view and it was quite alarming. About 70 percent of the patients she attended to died from the disease. 'I see a lot of sick people but there's just something about Ebola... You can tell who has it, they just get this distinctive look that's almost indescribable,' she said. 'It's something about the way they move. In the latest stage of the disease it starts to effect their state of mind and you could just see they were struggling mentally.' The 55-year-old anaesthetist helped set up a new Ebola isolation facility to help ease pressure on the hugely overcrowded hospitals . She said the 'space suits' shown in the media that were worn by health care workers was a reality but it made working conditions incredibly difficult. 'We were wearing the protective equipment dealing with the patients but it was very hot, the temperatures were very, very high. 'It was definitely exhausting.' Judging by her first-hand experience, Dr Stedmon said controlling the disease wouldn't happen any time soon unless more resources were injected into Africa. 'It's expensive and resource consuming to monitor people 24 hours a day. If they could get the resources and health care workers we could stop it spreading there,' she said. Dr Stedmon, who is now in quarantine for 21 days, said the sheer number of those affected and the fear it instilled in people was shocking and 'quite alarming' Judging by her first-hand experience, Dr Stedmon said controlling the disease wouldn't happen any time soon unless more resources were injected into Africa . 'I fear that people are just going to try and protect their own country but it's not going to spread in a first world country. Everyone on an international scale needs to concentrate on Africa. 'It's such an easy virus to kill - any soap and water, alcohol wipes and chlorine will kill it. But Africa just don't have the capacity to get on top of it. It spreads easily because they don't have sanitation.' The doctor said even though the thought of contracting the deadly disease had entered her mind, she said her month-long stint was rewarding because of the survivors. Dr Stedmon, who has worked with the Red Cross in war zones across the world, said the working conditions on Africa were quite hard . As an anaesthetist in Brisbane, Dr Stedmon said she was used to working with very high tech equipment. But in Africa she was only able to administer very basic care because of the conditions and equipment . 'One of the first patients into the new centre we set up was an 11-year-old girl who came in on her own... you could imagine how scary that would have been for her,' Dr Stedmon said. 'She was quite unwell, but over a week she got better and better every day. I don't know if she's out yet, but I'm pretty sure she was going to survive. We don't know if any of her family survived. 'A lot of people's families have been destroyed. It's not clear what they'll be sent back to if they survive. There's a lot of resistance for people in remote villages to accept people back who have had Ebola.' She said the 'space suits' shown in the media that were worn by health care workers was a reality but it made working conditions incredibly difficult . Dr Stedmon will now be quarantined for 21 days and is banned from touching people in case the protective suit wasn't enough. 'Health care workers were getting infected while I was there, it's not like I wasn't unaware if was happening. 'But in saying that there were measures the Red Cross instilled in us to ensure we looked out for each other.'

"An outlaw who teamed up with his wife to help his jail-bird brother run a drug-trafficking operation from behind bars has also been jailed.

He was jailed for five-and-a-half years while his wife Sophie was given a six-month sentence suspended for two years for conspiracy to supply cannabis and allowing her property to be used to produce the drug.

'It is clear from the volume of cash we recovered it was a lucrative enterprise and it was almost certainly the lure of easy money that persuaded Burgess to continue to pull the strings despite being locked up for dealing drugs,' he said. 'Unlike the vast majority of people who work for a living, these four simply wanted to line their own pockets producing and peddling drugs and I am delighted this operation has been exposed and they have been punished for their criminal behaviour. 'It must be galling for people in our community to see drug dealers like this who can't be bothered to find honest work driving around in flash cars and enjoying the wealth criminality can bring so it's a victory for our communities as much as anyone else to see these people brought down a peg or two.'","Peter Burgess and his wife operated drug ring at instruction of his brother .

The reports came from the states of Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. These sightings come during the annual Taurid meteor shower, which is going on right now and could lead to more reports of meteors in the next few nights. Taurid meteors are fragments of the Comet Encke, Bill Cooke of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center told WQAD. Encke is a three-mile wide comet of ice and rock that circles the sun every 3.3 years and its fragments are very large - producing bright meteors when their hit the Earth's atmosphere. One man in Chicago recorded a fireball traveling through the sky in that city, but it was later determined that the sightings were actually just a promotional stunt carried out by Red Bull. To promote an upcoming Red Bull event, three skydivers jumped out of a plane with flares shooting from their shoes as they drifted to the ground - creating a similar sight. Monday night's sightings also corresponded with a similar event over western Japan when night fell there hours before. Experts believe the object seen in Japan was a bolide, which is a very bright shooting star. On the other side of the world: A similar green object was seen over western Japan Monday night as well .","The meteor appeared over 12 eastern states Monday night around 6:20pm .

"Beverley Knight and Killian Donnelly were quietly going over a scene from the new musical Memphis before a rehearsal. Out of the corner of my eye I saw cast member Mark Carroll suddenly loom over them with a club, and proceed to pretend to beat them. It’s a moment of racial ugliness in Memphis, which won a Tony for best musical on Broadway four years ago, that shocks to the core. ‘The first time I did that scene, I must say I felt pretty sick inside,’ said Knight, who plays would-be singer Felicia Farr, ‘that people did that to each other, with no sense of guilt or shame.’ Beverley Knight stars as  aspiring singer Felicia Farr in new musical Memphis, set in segregated Tennessee . The show is set in segregated Tennessee and focuses on Huey Calhoun, a white DJ, played by Donnelly, who introduces the ‘devil’s music’ (rhythm and blues — or any music with a pulse) to the ‘white folks’ in the Fifties and early Sixties. Calhoun is loosely based on the late DJ Dewey Phillips, who launched R&B on his audience with a delivery like an express train. The reason for the beating in the show is that Huey and Felicia are dating. ‘Black and white romance was illegal then,’ Donnelly said. Knight said she had visited Memphis. ‘Segregation is over, but they still preserve the whites-only water fountain — and the blacks-only one.’ The singer was a sensation in the musical The Bodyguard before taking on Memphis, created by David Bryan, Joe DiPietro and director Christopher Ashley. The show is set in segregated Tennessee and focuses on Huey Calhoun, a white DJ, played by Killian Donnelly (left), who introduces the ‘devil’s music' The original songs and energy of the cast are exciting. I had some misgivings when I saw the show in New York, but it has been worked on since then. Donnelly and Knight make an electrifying duo. He has a special routine to protect his voice, and has been contracted to do seven out of eight performances each week. She will do six and drinks lashings of Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa, a black sweet Chinese tea, to keep her voice in tip-top condition for when previews start at the Shaftesbury Theatre on October 9. Katie can't wait to be the Carole singer . Oh! Carole! Actress Katie Brayben has been chosen to give voice to Carole King in the West End. The team behind the Broadway hit Beautiful have selected Ms Brayben, currently portraying Diana, Princess of Wales in the satirical play King Charles III, to play the singer/songwriter in a musical that charts her journey from Brooklyn schoolgirl to artist behind some of some of the world’s most beloved tunes — Will You Love Me Tomorrow, for starters. She wrote that one with first husband Gerry Goffin, along with Take Good Care Of My Baby, and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. In between writing many of those heartfelt numbers, though, Goffin cheated on her and took large amounts of drugs. Katie Brayben has been chosen to give voice to American singer Carole King in the West End . Songs written by King, Goffin, Cynthia Weil, Barry Mann and Neil Sedaka are woven around a story that eventually makes King the heroine of an edgy drama. And there’s not a number in Beautiful that you won’t know. Brayben has appeared in straight plays and musicals before and is a casting coup for the part. She plays the piano and cello, and writes and performs her own compositions. Her parents are folk and blues singers Fran McGillivray and Mike Burke, so there was always music in the family, what with her sister Jo Burke being a folk singer, too. ‘I’ve never known a project where I say: “I love that song! I love that song . . . and that one!” Brayben said, as we went through the King catalogue, which encompasses hits such as You’ve Got A Friend. ‘She’s such a wonderful songwriter, and the numbers have these beautiful melodies. They speak to people,’ Brayben said. One of Brayben’s friends told her she was a ‘natural’ for the show, and urged her to audition. At that time, the producers hadn’t decided whether to bring over Jessie Mueller, who created the role on Broadway. But Paul Blake and Mike Bosner, two of the main producers, told me that finally, they and director Marc Bruni decided to find an actress here. ‘It’s a star-making role,’ Blake explained — a view I share. Brayben is being allowed to leave King Charles III early to prepare for rehearsals that start in late December. Her spare time has been spent studying King’s concerts on YouTube, listening to her recordings and reading her autobiography. King studied Brayben, too; watching videos of the actress’s auditions and giving her blessing to the casting. Previews for Beautiful begin at the Aldwych Theatre on February 10, with an official first night on February 24. Alan Morrissey has been cast as Goffin, and Glynis Barber will play King’s mother. Lorna Want and Gary Trainor also co-star. The cast of the latest movie based on Jane Austen’s Pride And Prejudice spent little time researching etiquette and manners of the period. Instead, their focus was on martial arts and fight training. In Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, the latest iteration of Austen’s classic, the Bennet sisters are under attack from the flesh-eating un-dead, who pop up at the most inconvenient times. Actress-model Suki Waterhouse told me the cast, including Lily James as Elizabeth Bennet and Sam Riley as Mr Darcy, spent several days learning how to use a sword. ‘We have to know how to kill the zombies,’ she said. ‘You can’t just give them a little shove.’ The cast will wear period dress in the film, and much of Austen’s prose will be kept intact. ‘The zombie stuff is woven through the original text,’ Waterhouse explained. She joins the cast on set today, with director Burr Steers overseeing the mayhem. Waterhouse, 22, already knows how to box, and her father, a black belt, let her attend the karate classes he gave at a leisure centre when she was younger. The model has made a good fist of her fledgling thespian career. She fights on the side of the good guys in the film Insurgent, follow-up to Divergent. She also appears in Love, Rosie, which goes on release here on October 22. ‘That film gave me the proper itch to pursue acting as a career,’ she told me, noting that although she takes acting classes, ‘the best thing for me is to watch and observe’ other actors. Suki has been stepping out with Bradley Cooper, but when I asked her if rumours the pair were engaged were true, she replied, simply: ‘No, we’re not.’","Beverley Knight plays aspiring singer Felicia Farr in new musical Memphis .

"Steve Buscemi is an award-winning actor with dozens of film and TV credits to his name - but few people know that before embarking on a successful career in Hollywood he was one of New York’s bravest. As a young man in the early 1980s, Buscemi worked as an FDNY firefighter with Engine 55 in Little Italy. After spending four years putting out blazes, Buschemi switched gears and turned to acting. But when the terrorist attacks of September 11 happened, killing closes to 3,000 people - among them 343 firefighters - Buscemi spontaneously rejoined his old fire company as they went to work cleaning up Ground Zero. Scroll down for video . First job: At age 18 in 1980, Steve Buscemi (pictured on the engine truck far left), joined Engine 55 in Little Italy, where he served for four years . Behind the camera: Actor-producer Steve Buscemi, left, and FDNY Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro pose at the New York Premiere of the New HBO documentary A Good Job:  Stories of the FDNY . Now, the 56-year-old star of HBO's Boardwalk Empire has produced a new documentary titled A Good Job: Stories of the FDNY, which premiers on the premium cable network Monday. The documentary features interviews with current and former firefighters, and covers major - and often tragic - milestones in the history of the department, including 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported. Buscemi and director Liz Garbus at times struggled coaxing tales of real-life heroism out of New York’s bravest, who are usually not ones to brag. The Buscemi's brief stint as a firefighter, and his familiarly with the people serving on the force, went a long way helping them open up about their experiences. ‘He was able to tell our story from our perspective, so there's like a trust—that trust you get in the firehouse kitchen,’ retired FDNY Lt John Nolan told the paper. Steve Buscemi grew up on Long Island, the son of a sanitation worker and Korean War veteran who believed wholeheartedly in the importance of civil service, and who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. Buscemi's film features interviews with current and former firefighters, and commentary about major events in the FDNY's history, including 9/11, which took the lives of 343 members of the department . New York's bravest: (L to R) Joe Downey, Steve Buscemi, Chuck Downey and Robert Brown pose for photographers during the A Good Job: Stories of The FDNY' New York premiere at Sunshine Landmark on September 4 . Never forget: Buscemi (C) greets firefighters after a memorial service at Old St. Pat's Church to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2011 . Enduring passion: Buscemi served on the force only four years, but his love for the FDNY never faded . So when Steve turned 18 in 1980, he took a civil service test and before long became the newest member of Engine 55 in the heart of Little Italy. Buscemi recalled that on calls, his job was to control the hose. At first, he was seized by fear, but eventually he adapted to being in harm's way and ‘learned how to breathe.' But even as he fought fires in Manhattan, Buscemi harbored a not-so-secret secret passion for acting and went to auditions in his off-time. His screen debut came in 1985 in the film The Way It Is, but it was not until a year later that he really caught the acting bug after starring in Parting Glances. ‘I just thought, “This is my moment. If I don't take this, I don't know when it will come back,”’ he recalled. Around that time, he decided to focus on his acting career and parted ways with Engine 55. Boys in blue: Buscemi said his job on the crew was to control the hose, and that he was the quietest guy in the firehouse . When 9/11 happened, Buscemi (center) briefly rejoined his old engine company, helping them in the cleanup . Just like old times: The famed actor is seen here sharing a meal at his old firehouse with his pals . Buscemi went on to star in such iconic films as Fargo, Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, The Big Lebowski and Con Air. More than 15 years, as the Twin Towers lay in ruins in the harrowing days after 9/11, Mr Buscemi was wandering amid heaps of smoking debris when he ran into members of the fire company where he once served. He picked up where he left up, suiting up in his old fire-resistant gear to land a hand with the grim task at hand: removing buckets of debris and human remains in body bags. Buscemi said he made the documentary A Good Job with the goal of inspiring other young people to join the FDNY and raise awareness among current and past members of the department not to be afraid to seek help for whatever trauma they may have suffered. In his review of A Good Job,Variety TV critic Brian Lowery praised the makers of the documentary for their ability to weave anecdotes from the everyday lives of firefighters with tales of bravery, sprinkled with Buscemi’s personal recollections. American gangster: This fall, Buscemi returns to HBO's Boardwalk Empire, which will conclude its five-season run this year . 'By that measure,' he writes,' A Good Job is , indeed, a job well done.' After his stint behind the camera, this coming fall Steve Buschemi returns to HBO as Atlantic City's favorite gangster Nuckly Thompson in Season 5 of Boardwalk Empire.","Buscemi served with Engine 55 in Little Italy for four years in early 1980s .

"Engine still running: Jean-Francois Hauteville, 47, was found in his car with a bullet wound to the head . A hunter arrested in connection with the murder of a building contractor in the French Alps was today found dead in his prison cell. Jean-Francois Cottet-Dumoulin, 54, hanged himself after being implicated in a crime which took place just 50 miles from where three members of a British family died in strangely similar circumstances two years ago. The victim last week, Jean-Francois Hauteville, 47, suffered close-range bullet wounds to the head as he sat in his Peugeot Boxer van in a wooded area near Neuvecelle, close to Lake Geneva in eastern France. The engine of Mr Hauteville's car was still running last Wednesday when a passer-by found his body slumped behind the steering wheel - with the driver's window open. Mr Hauteville was a keen hunter, and French police soon arrested and placed farmer Mr Cottet-Dumoulin under investigation. They lived in the same Alpine town - Lugrin - and were both hunters said to be in dispute over a number of issues, including some £12,000 which Mr Cottet-Dumoulin had lent Mr Hauteville. But today Mr Cottet-Dumoulin's body was found hanging in his cell at Aiton Penitentiary, close to Albertville and Chambéry. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances. It was on September 5, 2012 that Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, and his wife, Iqbal, 47, died alongside her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74. Jail: Jean-Francois Cottet-Dumoulin's body was found hanging in his cell at Aiton Penitentiary (pictured), France . All suffered bullet wounds to the head as they sat in a BMW estate car, following an attack by a mystery gunman shooting outside, and at close range. The killer, who has never been found, also murdered a French cyclist called Sylvain Mollier, 45, whose body was found next to the estate car. It still had its engine running when the bodies were found by a British cyclist soon after the killings. The Al-Hilli's daughters, Zainab, seven at the time, and Zeena, four, survived the savage attack close to Lake Annecy. Eric Maillaud, who is leading the probe into the so-called Alp Murders, was also tasked with investigating the Neuvecelle killing, which police are certain was a 'murder'. While refusing to discuss a possible link between the two, Mr Maillaud said last week: 'It seems that he was killed by a shotgun after a shot at very close range. The van he was driving was stopped in the middle lane, and partially blocking the road. The victim had a face wound.' Map: Mr Hauteville was found along an Alpine road near Neuvecelle, 50 miles from where the Al-Hilli family were found in their car near Annency . Lugrin mayor Jacky Burnet said Mr Hauteville was a 'well-known figure, a dynamic worker who was heavily involved in the local community'. Police said that Mr Hauteville had 'spoken to the attacker' before the shooting, which is believed to have happened overnight on Tuesday to Wednesday. Mr Hauteville had a 'bullet in the temple,' said a police source. He said he ran a successful business specialising in painting and decorating, and was also a keen hunter. In September, Mr Maillaud said whoever was responsible for the 2012 killings may have got away with the 'perfect crime'. 'The further we advance, the less conviction we have,' he said, saying the enquiry 'lacks the element of a witness which allows everything to be opened up. On a number of occasions we thought we were on the right track.' Mr Maillaud said that 'after two years' hundreds of people had been interviewed, thousands of documents read, and numerous forensic tests carried out 'but there is no priority line of investigation that stands out'. Previous case: Saad Al-Hilli (left), 50, his wife, Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, all died after being shot from close range in their car (right) two years ago. The gunman has never been caught . Conceding that the inquiry could go on for years to come, Mr Maillaud said: 'We have tried everything possible, but we're perhaps we're in the presence of the perfect crime.' There have been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, of Chessington, Surrey. Zaid was last year arrested under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a lack of evidence. Investigators say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained marksman, and to know the local area extremely well. This has led to well-sourced theories that Mr Mollier, the cyclist, may have been the principal target. He had recently left his wife and two children two live with a multi-millionaire heiress, with whom he had just had a baby, and there were said to be tensions in the relationship. The 2011 killings took place in an isolated layby on a mountain road not far from the tiny village of Chevaline. A detective involved in the case said: 'The reality is that whoever did it left no forensic evidence, and disappeared without trace. It is sadly quite possible that this will never be solved.'","Jean-Francois Cottet-Dumoulin hanged himself at Aiton Penitentiary, France .

"A top banker has claimed Australians have an ‘irrational’ obsession with property investment as the latest data shows house prices only increased one per cent over October. The chief executive of the Australian arm of ANZ Bank, Phil Chronican, has warned that too many people are pinning their hopes on property investment as a way to cash in. ‘I think there is a bit of an irrational obsession with housing as an investment class. For many investors, they would be better off in assets other than housing,’ Mr Chronican told the Sydney Morning Herald. This three bedroom house in Milperra, Sydney, costs over $650,000. The median dwelling price for Sydney is now $680,000. Chief executive of the Australian arm of ANZ Bank, Phil Chronican (left), has warned that too many people are pinning their hopes on property investment as a way to cash in. While treasurer Joe Hockey (right) has been warned of a 'systematic risk' in the economy because of all the home loan debt . He said a tax distortion in housing could be the reason that property investment is booming and he suggested people aren’t necessarily aware of the disadvantages – such as the high cost of stamp duty – that come with investing. ‘From a community awareness viewpoint, I think there should be more debate around the strengths and weaknesses of housing as an investment class,’ Mr Chronican said. Mr Chronican has been a banker for more than 30 years but has also run a business with $209 billion of home loans connected to it, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. He earned $3,781,356 in 2013, thanks to his $1,191,978 salary and other compensations and bonuses, according to his executive profile on Business Week. The New Zealander was previously at Westpac Banking Corporation with roles in retail banking, capital markets, treasury, economics and strategy, including chief financial officer and head of institutional banking . In Melbourne, the average house price is $649,000. This two bedroom property in North Melbourne sold for $650,000 at the weekend . Treasurer Joe Hockey this month ordered a  financial system inquiry which revealed the huge amount of home loan debt in recent decades is a potential ‘systematic risk’ to the economy. However, Mr Chronican’s comments about Australians being obsessed with property investment may be out of kilter with reality. In March this year it was revealed less than 6 per cent of Australians, or roughly 1.3 million people, actually own an investment property. He previously took aim at the negative gearing used by millions of property owners in 2011. He claimed the tax break was leading to an unhealthy focus on housing as a way to get loaded, while pushing property prices to unaffordable levels, Domain reported. This four bedroom home in Hobart, comes at a cost of $340,000 - $365,000. The Tasmanian capital is now Australia’s most affordable city with a median dwelling price of $315,000 . In Hobart you can get more for your money. This colourful four bedroom home is listed as $340,000 - $370,000 . His latest comments come as the RP Data figures highlight that despite a slowdown in growth in September, property values continued to rise overall, increasing by 2.2 per cent over the past three months. But although combined capital city home values were up by one per cent over October, only Sydney (1.3%), Melbourne (1.9%) and Brisbane (0.6%) actually recorded value rises over the month. Meanwhile, the best performing city over the three months to October was Sydney, with an overall 3.9 per cent growth. The rise has made the NSW capital the most expensive place to live in Australia, with a median dwelling price of $680,000. The weakest performing state capital was Hobart, with -2.8 per cent growth. The Tasmanian capital is now Australia’s most affordable city with a median dwelling price of $315,000.","Less than  1.3 million Australians actually own an investment property .

"A former U.S. prison chief got the shock of his life after visiting a correctional facility in Norway and discovering that even hardened criminals are afforded a lifestyle far removed from that on offer back at home. For 38 years, retired superintendent James Conway worked in the Attica Correctional Facility in New York but found little to prepare him for his recent trip to Halden Prison in Norway. The U.S. famously has the highest documented incarceration rate in the world and Conway told the makers of a made-for-TV documentary called The Norden, that he had never wasted time worrying about his inmates well-being. Scroll down for video . Retired superintendent James Conway was shocked when he visited luxurious Halden prison in Norway . He said he could not believe what he saw and had a hard time believing it was a prison after taking a tour . ‘It was your actions that put yourself here,’ he said. ‘Who cares how they feel?’ Halden Prison is one of Norway's newest correctional facilities and takes an approach to inmates that had Conway questioning if he was really in a prison, reports Finansakrobat. ‘I'm having a hard time believing that I'm in a prison,’ Conway told Jan Stromnes, deputy head of the prison as he took Conway on a tour. As he is given a tour of the grounds, Conway is shocked at how green the surroundings are. Mr Conway was worried by the kitchen at Halden Prison which featured real knives and forks . He was shocked by the luxury items available to prisoners including an Xbox and a recording studio . Halden Prison is one of Norway's newest correctional facilities and takes an approach to inmates that had Conway questioning if he was really in a prison . 'Jan, it would appear that you've chosen to construct your prison in a forest and in a mountain area. Can you offer any explanation as to why that would be?' he said. Stromnes explained that the architect suggested that the prison 'keep as much of the nature as possible' so inmates could serve under normal conditions — a key principle of the Norwegian prison system. Next, Conway visits Unit C, a building that houses 84 inmates. Ten inmates share a spacious living room complete with a large television and dartboard. Conway is most shocked by the kitchen, which actually features real knives and forks. 'I'm surprised to see metal silverware in a high-security facility,' he said. 'It's a very well-equipped kitchen.' The inmates even had a workshop with sharp tools and hammers which could be used as weapons . He discovered that  even hardened criminals were afforded a lifestyle far removed from that on offer in the US . The kitchen has other surprises for Conway, with the cupboards well stocked with glasses and porcelain dishes. 'Very functional - however very sharp,' said Conway. Elsewhere in the facility inmates even have access to tools. After being shown wire hangers in the closets, Conway voices his surprise and warns that inmates could fashion the top into an 'ice-pick-type weapon.' But 'if there is a steel knife in the drawer around the corner, why would you need metal from a hanger?' he reasons. Beyond his safety concerns,  Conway was also surprised by the luxury items available to prisoners including an Xbox and a recording studio. 'I know there's a lot of education and vocational programmings to prepare inmates for work on the outside, but I must say I've never seen anything like this,' Conway admits. He was surprised by the well-equipped kitchen as it is unusual to see  metal silverware in a high-security facility . After being shown wire hangers in the closets, Conway voices his surprise and warns that inmates could fashion the top into an 'ice-pick-type weapon' He said that if inmates at his old prison could design the prison of their dreams - it would look a lot like Halden . 'This may be a little over the top.' Stromnes explains that the recording studio is part of a music teaching program, which officials hope will lead to less crime. 'This is prison utopia,' said Conway. He said that if inmates at his old prison could design the prison of their dreams - it would look a lot like Halden. 'I don't think you can go any more liberal - other than giving the inmates the keys.' In spite of Conway finding fault with the prison he visited, the numbers show that  Norway has an incarceration rate of 70 per 100,000, totaling 3, 571 inmates for the entire country. The rate in the U.S. is more than 10 times that with 707 per 100,000, or 2,228,424 people behind bars.","James Conway got the shock of his life after visiting a prison in Norway .

Neither entered a plea at the court hearing and the couple were successful in their application for the charges to be dropped, reports the New Zealand Herald. Olivia Mihaljevich, 29, and Ayman Elarnaouty, 33, appeared in court in Queenstown today and both faced a charge of assault . Court documents at the hearing listed Mr Elarnaouty as a doctor and the bride as a nurse.

"The mother of an  Indonesian transgender woman who was killed and dismembered by her Australian husband says her eldest child was a 'kind and cheerful' person.

Her mother, Nining Sukarni, only spoke to her eldest child, who she refers to as her son Febri, last Thursday from her Indonesian home. Scroll down for video . Body parts belonging to Mayang Prasetyo, 27, were found strewn across the inner-city Brisbane apartment she shared with her Australian husband Marcus Volke on Saturday . 'He was a kind person, cheerful, warm to people, effervescent, always going from here to there,' Ms Nining told AAP. She said Ms Prasetyo was restless in Brisbane having moved there to be with her husband, Marcus Volke, after meeting while working on a cruiseship. Ms Nining said she told her daughter not to fight with Volke. 'Our last communication was a week before the incident. She was just fine so I still don't believe it,' Ms Nining told Nine News. Her mother, Nining Sukarni, spoke to her eldest child, who she refers to as her son Febri, last week before she was found dead . Ms Prasetyo, pictured here in white before undergoing breast and facial surgery in 2009, grew up as a 'normal boy' before heading overseas, according to Ms Nining . She worked as as transgender escort in Australia and sent her earnings back home to Indonesia to support her single mother and two younger sisters . 'She would always tell me if something was happening to her. I wasn't suspicious because she didn't tell me bad things were happening to her.' Ms Nining said Ms Prasetyo sought her blessing before she married Volke abroad in 2013, and the couple had visited her home in Bandar Lampung, Sumatra, last year. She was stunned by the crime, believing Volke to be 'kind, polite'. Ms Mayang, who is said to have begun gender reassignment therapy in 2009, worked as as transgender escort in Australia and sent her earnings back home to Indonesia to support her single mother and two younger sisters. Ms Prasetyo is believed to have died at the hands of husband Marcus Volke, who took his own life shortly after police found the woman's remains boiling on the stove in their apartment . It has been revealed Volke was also working in the sex industry having secretly worked as a male prostitute . She was the backbone of the family having paid for her sisters, aged 18 and 15, to be educated. Ms Nining told tribunnews.com that Ms Prasetyo adored celebrities, particularly Indonesian soap star-turned-politician Krisna Mukti, and dreamed of becoming 'rich and famous'. She had named herself Mayang after Indonesian singer Mayang Sari, and Prasetyo after a previous boyfriend, she told kompas.com. Until graduating high school in 2005, Ms Nining said her eldest 'grew up as a normal boy' before travelling abroad. Before going by the name Mayang Prasetyo, the 27-year-old was known as Febri Andriansyah as shown on her Indonesian passport . Her mother described the 27-year-old as a kind and cheerful person who was always travelling . Ms Prasetyo's family say while she grew up as a boy, she always identified as a girl from a young age . But he is believed to have identified as a girl from a young age with one of the sisters, Gebi, telling Indonesia's SCTV: 'Since he was little, he would usually hang out with girls.' Ms Prasetyo, who was a pre-operation transsexual, was just months away from becoming a woman anatomically. Ms Nining said she hoped her child's remains could be repatriated for burial in Indonesia as a prayer service was held in Bali on Tuesday night. 'We never expected she would end up like this, and that her boyfriend would have the heart to do that,' her friend Albert said.

"The head of Burkina Faso's armed forces took power today after President Blaise Compaore resigned amid mass demonstrations against an attempt to extend his 27-year rule that military chief General Honore Traore had taken over the reins of power. Compaore, who seized power in a 1987 coup, had attempted to defy popular pressure for him to step down after a day of violent protests on Thursday in which demonstrators stormed parliament and state television. However, with hundreds of thousands of protesters packing the streets of the capital Ouagadougou for a second day today and no sign of international support for him staying on, Compaore announced his resignation. 'I declare that I'm leaving power in order to have a free and transparent election in 90 days,' said Compaore in a statement read out on television and radio stations. 'For my part, I think I have fulfilled my duty.' A heavily armed convoy believed to be carrying Compaore was seen today travelling towards the southern town of Po, near the border with Ghana, two diplomatic sources and local media said.

Crowds danced and cheered in Ougadougou's dusty streets, blowing on whistles after Compaore's statement was broadcast. But the mood cooled as it became plain that military chief General Honore Traore had taken over the reins of power. Under Burkina Faso's constitution, when the president resigns the head of the National Assembly should take office, but parliament had already been dissolved by Traore on Thursday under short-lived martial law. For months, an opposition coalition has been urging Compaore not to seek re-election for what would have been his fifth term in power. But he and his ruling party looked set to push a bill through Parliament on Thursday that would have allowed him to run again. Determined to block the vote, protesters stormed the building, the vote was suspended and the military announced the legislature had been dissolved and a transition government would be formed. After that Compaore said he would lead until the new elections. But protesters rejected that plan and gathered again Friday, demanding that Compaore step down immediately. 'Considering the urgency of saving the nation, I have decided that I will assume from this day the responsibility of the head of state,' Traore told a news conference. 'I undertake a solemn engagement to proceed without delay with consultations with all parties in the country so as to start the process of returning to the constitutional order as soon as possible.'

President Blaise Compaore, pictured left, a former army captain, seized power of the West African nation in a bloody coup in 1987 . There was no immediate reaction from opposition leaders to Traore's announcement. Many protesters said they wanted a transition led by retired General Kouame Lougue, a popular former defence minister who was accused of trying to topple Compaore in 2004. Long a bastion of stability in the turbulent Sahel region, Burkina Faso's crisis is being closely watched by military allies France and the United States, and by governments in the region where several long-standing rulers are approaching the end of their mandates amid rumbling of popular discontent. 'This is a sub-Saharan Spring and it must continue against all the presidents who are trying to hang on to power in Africa,' said law student Lucien Trinnou, referring to the Arab Spring that toppled several long-term leaders. French President Francois Hollande, who had discretely sought ways to usher Compaore into an international role when his term was due to have ended next year, welcomed the former president's resignation in a statement and called for quick elections to be held. Burkina Faso is one of the world's poorest nations but has positioned itself as a mediator in regional crises. It is also a key ally in Western operations against al Qaeda-linked groups in West Africa and one of the last African states to retain diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Regional West African bloc ECOWAS said on Thursday it would not accept any party seizing power through non-constitutional means in an apparent suggestion of diplomatic pressure to leave Compaore in place. A delegation from the African Union, the United Nations and ECOWAS was due in Burkina Faso on Friday to hold talks with all parties.

"A pair of thieves were caught on CCTV stripping computer screens from a train station after one was dressed in a bright red polka dot onesie and the other in a pair of distinctive purple leggings. British Transport police are now hunting for the men after the string of monitor screen thefts which took place earlier this month at Dewsbury train station in West Yorkshire. Officers have now released the CCTV images of the pair in their outlandish outfits in a bid to track them down. The men dressed in a red polka dot onesie and another in purple leggings, who police are hunting after a spate of monitor thefts from Dewsbury train station . One images shows the man in the onesie walking ahead of another man, who is wearing the bright leggings, while carrying a spade. The expensive monitors can't be used as TVs but can be hooked up to a computer or games system. In total three of the screens were stolen from the station on three separate evenings earlier this month. PC Marcus Robinson said: 'We are releasing their images in that hope that, despite their faces being covered, someone may recognise their distinctive dress. 'One of the men is wearing a red polka dot onesie, the other appears to be wearing purple leggings and carrying a spade. 'CCTV at the station captured the two people pictured on Monday, 6 October just after 10.50pm when the third screen was stolen. The pair were spotted on CCTV wearing the distinctive outfits earlier this month, on the same night one of the screens was taken . 'We believe they may be able to assist our enquiries into this incident and are investigating whether they are linked to the other two thefts.' Police believe that when the monitors were stolen, the security surround on the screens was forced off before they were taken. PC Robinson added: 'The screens, which are expensive and will now have to be replaced, are used to provide up to date travel information to passengers at the station and usually only operate in a commercial environment. 'First TransPennine Express, who manage the station, have now increased security measures on other screens at their stations to make them more difficult to steal. 'If you recognise them, have been offered one of the screens, or have any information that could help our investigation, please contact us.'

"Network: Cabin manager Dennis Connolly recruited friends as mules to smuggle cigarettes into the UK . An easyJet flight attendant masterminded a £200,000 tobacco smuggling ring - using staff discount to pay for scores of continental 'ciggie runs'. Cabin manager Dennis Connolly recruited friends as mules - including easyJet stewardess Adele Jenkinson - in one of the biggest conspiracies of its kind. To avoid detection the airline staff swapped information about the movements of customs officers before jetting out to Spain and Portugal on day trips and short breaks. Flying out to Faro, Malaga and Alicante with near-empty suitcases, the gang stocked up on cheap cigarettes before flying back to the UK. The cigarettes could be sold cheaply and profitably on the black market because duty had not been paid on them. In all, Connolly organised up to 150 trips for himself and other conspirators, bringing in 1,000kg of tobacco and evading £179,773 in taxes for three years. The 43-year-old has now been jailed for 21 months at Manchester Crown Court after admitting conspiracy to evade duty and possessing criminal property. His defence said that having already lost his career and home, jail would be 'catastrophic' for him. The court heard Connolly, of  Southport, Merseyside, joined easyJet in 1999, and had enjoyed an unblemished career. However, in 2007 his boyfriend died of pancreatic cancer and grief-stricken Connolly gambled away a £90,000 life insurance payout playing virtual roulette. He ran up debts and was approached by a pal who suggested he set up a contraband tobacco racket. Alex Leach, prosecuting, told Manchester Crown Court the plot unravelled in April after smugglers Terence Steele, Paul Rigby and Dale O'Brien were caught by customs and linked to Connolly's discount flight bookings, triggering a Revenue and Customs investigation.

Flight records analysis led to Jenkinson and her partner Barry Gwynn being arrested. The pair were suffering money problems when Connolly recruited them, paying them £400 a trip. Jenkinson quit the airline after pleading guilty to conspiring to evade duty alongside the others. Sentencing for the 'commercial scale operation', Recorder Thomas QC gave each of the others jail sentences suspended for two years. Rigby, 44, of Lovely Lane, Warrington, got an eight-month jail sentence with a curfew, Steele, 57, of Abbotsbury Way, Liverpool, 12 months with 120 hours unpaid work, O'Brien, 36, of St Helens, 12 months with 120 hours unapid work, Gwynn, 39, eight months with 120 hours, and Jenkinson, 41, of East Avenue, Stockton Heath, 14 months with 200 hours unpaid work.

Sandra Smith, assistant director, Criminal Investigation, HMRC, said: 'Airline employees hold a position of trust and abusing such privileges in order to smuggle is a serious matter. 'Connolly organised subsidised travel purely for smuggling purposes. There are no excuses for smuggling, whatever your status. 'Tobacco fraud costs honest taxpayers more than £2bn a year, undercutting honest businesses, and drawing people into wider criminality.'","Dennis Connolly jailed for 21 months for sophisticated scam .

"Cheryl Cole has returned to the X Factor, released a new album and got married for a second time this year – and now the singer can add another, albeit less coveted, string to her bow. The 31-year-old judge, whose married name is now Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, has been voted the web’s most dangerous UK celebrity, while chat show host Jimmy Kimmel tops the list of US celebrities. Security experts discovered that 15 per cent of searches for the singer are riddled with viruses, spam and other security risks, and this increases to more than 19 per cent for 46-year-old Mr Kimmel. Scroll down for video . Security experts at California-based McAfee scanned search results for viruses and spam. They found that 15% of searches for Cheryl Cole (pictured left) - whose married name is now Fernandez-Versini - contain security risks. This increases to 19.4% for US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel (pictured right) The Most Dangerous Celebrities study was conducted by California-based security firm McAfee. Other celebrities to make the top ten lists in the UK and US were actor Daniel Radcliffe (13 per cent), DJ Armin van Buuren (19 per cent) and footballer David Beckham (12 per cent). One Direction star Harry Styles (11 per cent), rapper Flo Rida (19 per cent) and presenter and singer Alesha Dixon (12 per cent) also made the cut, as did older stars including Bruce Springsteen (19 per cent), Jon Bon Jovi (18 per cent) and comedienne Chelsea Handler (17 per cent). McAfee said the public thirst for gossip means that many would-be hackers base their attacks and malicious software around links connected to celebrity names - adding words such as ‘video’ or ‘picture’ to the end, in order to lure in users. David Beckham (pictured) was the only sports star to make the top 10 list of the UK's most dangerous celebrities online. The majority of celebrities were singers such as Harry Styles, Ellie Goulding, Bruce Springsteen and Britney Spears . The percentages were compiled using McAfee SiteAdvisor site ratings. This indicates which sites are risky to search when attached to celebrity names on the web, and experts used this rating to calculate an overall risk percentage. In particular, searches for ‘Cheryl Cole downloads’ and ‘Cheryl Cole mp4s’ were some of the riskiest when tested. The percentages were compiled using McAfee SiteAdvisor site ratings.

More than 13% of searches for the Harry Potter star contain security risks, compared to more than 16% of online searches for the 33-year-old singer . ‘The desire for consumers to have access to the latest celebrity information can often make them vulnerable to cybercrime,’ said Samantha Humphries-Swift, product manager at McAfee Labs. ‘Most consumers do not realise the security risks they are exposing themselves to when searching for celebrity videos and images online. ‘But cybercriminals can exploit this desire for breaking celebrity news, leading consumers to sites that download harmful malware on to their devices and compromise personal data.’ It is thought that techniques like this - where users are enticed into clicking a link - known as ‘phishing’, may have formed part of the hack that had led to the posting of hundreds of nude celebrity photos on online forums. McAfee has warned that free downloads are ‘by far the highest virus-prone search term’, and advises people to stick to official websites, and not give out personal information when asked via email or text message.","Security experts at McAfee scanned search results for viruses and spam .

"Forget Cara Delevingne and Karlie Kloss, there are a whole host of fresh new fashion faces on the scene who are quickly becoming the toast of the modeling industry - before they've even reached their twelfth birthdays. According to an article by Jane Ridley at the New York Post, these mini models are now among some of fashion's highest-earning stars, with many commanding six-figure sums for one television commercial and up to $1,500 per day for editorial work. Take 11-year-old Ekaterina Samsonov. Despite her young age, Ekat - as she is known to her friends - has already appeared in campaigns for the likes of J Crew, DKNY, Macy's and JC Penney, earning a reported $50,000 in the last year alone. Scroll down for video . Pint-sized star: Ekaterina Samsonov has already modeled for the likes of DKNY, J Crew and Macy's . Like father, like son: Hudson Kroenig, son of Chanel model and muse Brad Kroenig (right, with Hudson, in January 2013), has already modeled for Chanel (left), Dolce & Gabbana and Fendi . High earner: Lily Chee has raked in $12,500 this year thanks to her work with the likes of Nike and Levi's . And as if that wasn't enough, the pint-sized fashion star has also landed herself roles in two upcoming movies. The first, Anesthesia, which also stars Kristen Stewart, is due out later this year, while indie drama The Ticket is set to hit screens some time in 2015. Then there's Hudson Kroenig, the six-year-old son of Chanel model and muse Brad Kroenig and his wife Nicole. Hudson made his catwalk debut alongside his famous father in the Chanel S/S ’11 show and since then has gone on to appear in campaigns for Fendi and Dolce & Gabbana. He has also appeared in the pages of Harper's Bazaar and W Magazine. While Hudson's annual earnings are kept a closely-guarded secret by his parents, it's thought that he is most likely to be one of the world's top-earning child models, thanks in large part, no doubt, to his impressive fashion heritage. 1. Ekaterina Samsonov, $50k . The 11-year-old had a bumper year thanks to campaigns for J Crew, Macy's and JC Penney - to name but a few. She also earned an unspecified five-figure sum for her work on a Nutella commercial for network TV that took a day to film. 2. Baylor and Hudson Cryder, $45k each . Both Baylor, 10, and Hudson, 7, have well and truly earned their place among fashion's elite, after landing jobs with the likes of Ralph Lauren Children, J.Crew and Oscar de la Renta Kids. 3. Lily Chee, $22k . After being discovered by a Whilemena Models scout while shopping with her dad, 11-year-old Lily has worked with Nike, Levi's, Kohls, Uniqlo and Ralph Lauren. 4. Julian O’Neill, $12,500 . Despite his young age, seven-year-old Julian has already worked with a huge number of high-profile brands, including Hanna Andersson, Euroclub Kids, Roberto Cavalli Kids, Vogue Bambini and Toys R Us. 5. Hudson Kroenig, unknown . While six-year-old Hudson's exact earnings have not been revealed, insiders believe that the Chanel campaign star is likely to be one of the highest-earning mini models around. And while Ralph Lauren model Lily Chee took a slightly different route into the industry - she was discovered by a Whilemina Models scout while shopping with her dad Max two years ago - that hasn't stopped her from amassing an extensive portfolio of editorial work which includes campaigns for Nike, Levi’s, Kohls and Uniqlo. The 11-year-old's modeling  has earned her $22,000 in the last year - a figure which looks set to keep rising if her popularity continues. There are also a number of sibling mini models currently scaling the fashion ladder. Baylor and Hudson Cryder are two of the most popular child models currently working in the industry and the pair have achieved the type of success that many adult models can only dream of. Baylor, 10, recently appeared on the front cover of Vogue Bambino, while Hudson, 7, was flown out to the Bahamas in order to appear alongside British socialite India Hicks in a Ralph Lauren shoot. 'It was crazy,' mother Mary said of the whirlwind trip during an interview with the New York Post. 'But most of the work is in and around New York City.' Sisters Emilie and Alexandra Su lead a similarly jet-set lifestyle. The duo regularly appear alongside each other on high-profile campaigns around the world and have recently worked with the likes of Saks Fifth Avenue, Target, Uniqlo, H&M, GlaxoSmithKline and Nickelodeon. Thankfully for the pair, their mother, Jayne Choi, is incredibly supportive of their early career path. 'I love the confidence [that] modeling has brought my daughters,' she told the New York Post. 'They have good manners and the poise and focus [that] you need in this industry.' Sister, sister: Emilie (right) and Alexandra Su have both appeared on giant billboards in Asia . Family ties: Brothers Hudson (left) and Baylor Cryder are two of the top-earning child models in the business . Model behaviour: Julian O'Neill is a rising star in the child modeling industry and has already appeared in a 12-page spread in Elle . According to renowned children's photographer Lee Clower, it's not the parents' opinions who matter when it comes to child modeling - but rather the young fashionistas who are doing the work. The New-York based snapper's work is regularly featured in Vogue Bambino and PetitePARADE magazines and he has worked on numerous occasions with many of the world's leading young models. He told MailOnline: 'The most important element of a star kid is that the kid wants to be there at the shoot, not that the mom wants the kid there.'","Top child models can earn six-figure sums for TV ads and up to $1,500 per day for editorial work .

His franchise has also sent and received a trophy with the names of tennis stars Lleyton Hewitt and Serena Williams engraved on it for The Brisbane International tennis tournament. 'It gets sent down to Melbourne for repairs and to have the names of new winners engraved on it after each tournament.' Mr Paul said with the advent of  online shopping and its increased use, his company is sending more items across the world than ever before. 'The landscape in terms of sending parcels in the e-commerce industry is improving,' he said. 'There are more parcels being sent than ever before as a result of more things being bought online.'

"A neuroscientist from Austin, Texas gave the love of his life a brain in a jar--a wedding gift that some may have trouble wrapping their heads around. Michael Mack's bride-to-be Meg Mack on the other hand thought the gift was the most unexpected, thoughtful, and unique gift she'd ever imagined. Inside a jar meant especially for her was a 3D printed perfect model of her suitor's brain. The delivery: A jar filled with a mystery item along with a note was delivered to bride-to-be Meg Mack before she was about to be wed in Austin Texas . Befuddled: Meg Mack held a jar with some stuffing and a note from her husband to be Micheal but had no idea what would be hidden inside . Some jewelry perhaps?: Meg Mack twists the jar in excitement to see what mystery might be hiding inside . 'There was bunch of stuffing in there and then I thought ""Oh my God, this is a brain,""' said Mack. Both Meg and her husband Michael are neuroscientists and Michael says he thought of the gift because his wife loves men for their intelligence and brain. 'She judges people by their brain,' said the groom to the Houston Chronicle. Both husband and wife work at the Center for Memory and Learning at the University of Texas in Austin so Meg was quickly able to identify just whose brain she was holding. 'It was a little bumpy and weird and then I thought, 'This is a 3D printing of his brain,' she said. Not only did she recognize whose brain it was, she liked the way it felt in her hands and in her heart. 'His brain was very normal and very good-looking; that was a nice bonus to have,' said Meg Mack, . 'It was pretty symmetrical ... not having anything too weird in it.' The jar now sits on the couple's dresser in Austin and the couple are happy to share a life and a brain together. Layers: Meg had to search through layers of stuffing in order to find her zany and romantic surprise . What could it be: After pulling out spaghetti like paper shreds Meg Mack finally uncovered the brains behind her big wedding surprise . A brain: Meg and her husband are neuroscientists so it didn't take her too long to discover that the 3D printed gift in a jar was of a brain, her husband's to be exact . Great minds: Great minds may think alike and apparently they also make great wedding gifts, especially when both the bride and the groom are neuroscientists .","Michael Mack gave his bride-to-be Meg Mack a 3D printed model of his brain in a jar .

"Six months today voters will get the chance to hand David Cameron another five years in Downing Street – or kick him out in favour of Ed Miliband. With the parties neck and neck in the polls, the election is expected to be the closest since October 1974, when Harold Wilson won a tiny three seat majority over Edward Heath – giving Labour another five years in Government. Like Wilson 40 years ago, Mr Cameron is stuck just shy of being able to govern alone – 46 seats ahead of Labour, but 23 short of an outright Commons majority. To get over the line, the Prime Minister needs to hold on to his 303 MPs  while winning another 23 seats just to achieve a one-seat Commons majority. Mr Miliband meanwhile needs to take just 24 seats directly off the Tories to make Labour the biggest party in the Commons. If he is able to pull it off, the Labour leader would get the first shot at forming a Coalition government - probably with Nick Clegg as his Deputy Prime Minister. If he manages to take 24 seats off the Conservatives while holding on to his own 257 MPs, in six months Mr Miliband will be Prime Minister with 281 seats to the Tories 279. But, with the vast majority of seats rock-solid Labour or Tory the next election will be fought in crunch marginal constituencies. Here MailOnline reveals the Tories' 25 top targets to win in six months - and Labour's 30-seat wishlist to kick Mr Cameron onto the backbenches. Scroll down for video . The 55 constituencies which hold the key to Number 10: If the Tories can win their 25 target seats, listed on the left,  David Cameron will have won the next election with a one seat majority. Labour meanwhile need to win the 30 seats listed on the right to become the Commons largest party . For Labour to form a majority government on their own, they need to hold on to every seat they won under Gordon Brown in 2010, while winning in another 69 constituencies around the country. According to the latest poll for YouGov, Labour have a 1 per cent lead over the Tories – with 33 per cent of the public backing Mr Miliband’s party, to the Tories’ 32 per cent. However, a separate Survation poll for the Daily Mirror suggests Mr Miliband has pulled ahead of the Tories – with Ukip swaying Conservative voters more than those of any other party. According to Survation, the Tories have dropped to 27 per cent compared, with Labour standing firm on 31 per cent. Ukip is now on 24 per cent and Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent. But, despite being ahead in the polls across the UK, Labour is facing disaster in Scotland. Recent surveys have suggested the Scottish National Party could win 47 seats north of the border in in May – wiping out any chance of Mr Miliband winning a majority. According to the Panelbase survey, Scottish Labour could face winning just ten seats – down from 40 today. The poll of 1,000 adults found 45 per cent intended to vote for the SNP, 28 per cent for Labour and 15 per cent for the Tories. Voters in just a few dozen seats will decide whether David Cameron remains in Number 10, or if Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister . The crisis in Scotland has helped spark the biggest crisis of Mr Miliband’s leadership. It comes amid rising panic that his own personal unpopularity is costing Labour support in its traditional heartlands. Analysis of voter satisfaction ratings over four decades reveals Mr Miliband is down to minus 34. It means he is less popular than any Prime Minister or opposition leader at this point ahead of an election, except Michael Foot who led Labour to its worst ever defeat. Jim Callaghan, Neil Kinnock, John Major, William Hague, Michael Howard and Gordon Brown all had higher net satisfaction ratings with IpsosMORI six months before being hammered at the ballot box. Since becoming leader four years ago Mr Miliband has seen a collapse in his public satisfaction ratings. A month after he defeated his brother for the leadership, 41 per cent per of voters were satisfied with Mr Miliband with just 19 per cent dissastified, giving a net rating of 19 points. In the latest IpsoMORI survey, published two weeks ago, the figure had slumped to -34, twice as bad as David Cameron's -17. A separate YouGov poll found 34 per cent of people think Mr Cameron would make the best Prime Minister from a list of the four main party leaders – twice the number who backed Mr Miliband. Some 49 per cent of Labour voters think the party would be more likely to win next year’s election if Ed was replaced as party leader. CONSTITUENCY . Fermanagh . Hampstead and Kilburn .

"A fatberg stretching 66 feet beneath the government offices in Whitehall will be cleared as it was blocking all the sewers in the central London stretch and risking sewage coming up through people's plugholes. The fatberg - one of the biggest ever to be cleared by Thames Water - has been largely created by people throwing wet wipes and fat down drains and toilets, which then congeals into a large immovable mass. Removing the fatberg will cost tens of thousands of pounds and is likely to cause disruption as roads in central London will have to be closed to make way for specialist equipment. But if it is left it will grow, more fat and wet wipes will congeal, and there is a real risk that sewers could flood and people living nearby will see waste coming up through their sinks and toilets. Scroll down for video . A fatberg measuring 66ft long has been found beneath the Government offices in Whitehall, in London . The congealed mass of fat and wet wipes occupies a trunk sewer beneath Whitehall, where all smaller sewer pipes feed into before waste is taken to Beckton in west London to be removed. The fatberg is at the junction of Whitehall Court and Whitehall Place in south London and is in a sewer measuring 6ft high and 3ft wide. It stretches throughout 66 feet of the central London sewer and is almost the length of an articulated, or bendy, bus. The Whitehall fatberg is broken down into smaller pieces spread through the extensive stretch of pipes but is still one of the biggest ever Thames Water have had to deal with. Officials at Thames Water said the amount of fat contained in the mass is not surprising given that pipes from Regent Street, where there are a number of restaurants and fast food outlets, feed into it. Dave Dennis, the sewer manager for west London at Thames Water, said: 'We have 67,108 miles of sewers, and that's a lot of pipe to keep clear. Sewer worker Tim Henderson is holding a piece of fatberg he grabbed out of the Whitehall ‘river of fat’ The Whitehall sewer is a trunk sewer, which means smaller pipes feed into it before the waste is taken away . 'We spend £12 million a year tackling blockages, most of them formed because people have tipped cooking fats down the drain and wet wipes down the loo. 'The sewers serve an important purpose - they are not an abyss for household rubbish.' Mr Dennis warned against throwing rubbish down sewers and drains, such as wet wipes and fat which because this does not break down. Instead it congeals into large immovable clumps and can cause sewer floods, which he described as 'horrific.' He added: 'We find objects down the sewers every day that should not be there. Planks of wood, plastic bottles, and the bane of our lives – wet wipes. They may say flushable on the packet but they don't break down inside the sewer. A close-up of the fatberg, which has been formed by a collection of fat and wet wipes congealing into a mass . The fatberg is located in a sewer at the junction of Whitehall Place and Whitehall Court, measuring 6ft tall . 'They cling to cooled cooking fat and form fatbergs, which block pipes and flood our customers with sewage.' Officials examining the Whitehall fatberg found nail varnish pots, a pencil sharpener, condoms, and sanitary products - all of which should not be there. Staff from Thames Water will use powerful suction equipment to break down the blockage and then high-powered water jets to clear the tunnels. Because of the central location of the fatberg roads will have to be closed so equipment can be taken down into the sewers and there is likely to be significant disruption. Thames Water said it has to remove around 55,000 fatbergs a year, caused by people throwing unsuitable rubbish down toilets and drains which congeals into a large immovable mass. This costs more than £1million a month. A fatberg formed from fat, wet wipes and other litter wrongly put down drains and toilets - was detected under a 260ft stretch of a road in Shepherd’s Bush just two months ago and measured about the size of a Boeing 747 . A 15 ton fatberg was found congealed in a London city sewer in August 2013 and was dubbed the biggest ever . Just two months ago, a fatberg described as being the length of a Boeing 747 was found to be blocking the sewer beneath homes in Shepherd's Bush, west London. A fatberg is a congealed lump consisting of fat, wet wipes, sanitary items and other items in sewer systems, which unlike lavatory paper do not break down. Fatberg is the official term given to the deposits by Thames Water in London. Regarded as a nuisance, they can also be used as fuel, specifically biogas. The blockage was made up of waste fat, wet wipes, food, tennis balls and planks of wood. Staff from Thames Water found the blockage when they checked beneath a 260ft section of road. They cleared the huge underground pipe using high-powered jets. Last year a huge fatberg with a mass of 15 tonnes and measuring the size of a double-decker bus was found beneath the streets of London, and was growing at a mass of three extra tonnes a month as people continued to pour fat down drains and put wet wipes down the lavatory.","Fatberg is blocking sewage pipes beneath Government offices in Whitehall .

"A holidaymaker staying at a Chinese hotel couldn't help but take a picture when he spotted posters telling guests how to use a Western-style toilet. The signs, which illustrate the right and wrong ways for guests to go about their business, were posted in the loos of a hotel in Changde in the Hunan Province. The instructions tell users to sit on the toilet, rather than squat on the edge of the rim, or spread their legs out wide or, in what must the the strangest instruction, not to carry out handstands. How to: According to this sign, toilet users should sit rather than squat, do handstands or spread their legs . According to the Rocket News 24, which featured the sign after the unnamed guest posted them on a Chinese networking site, the man found it so funny that he started 'cracking up' and had to 'hold in his tummy for three minutes'. The unnamed hotel responded to the guest's comment, saying: 'There are certainly people that would use the toilet by putting their feet on the toilet seat. 'So, while laughing to your heart's content, be sure to follow the rules on how to use the toilet.' Toilets in the Far East are usually suitable for squatting, so it's not surprising that instructions were required to show users the right way to use a seated loo. Other signs placed in toilets tell guests not to fish, perch on or stand up whilst using the loo. Dos and don'ts: Whilst some instructions are obvious, there are others which are hard to understand .","A Western visitor spotted the signs and posted them online .

"A 22 st actress has lost eight stone after fearing her frame would hold her back from being cast as Tinkerbell. Kate Gilbert, 34, from Solihull, Warks, has slimmed to an incredible size 12 so she can slip into floaty dresses and wings for her dream role in the Peter Pan pantomime. And now the impish star, who is part of amateur drama group Union Theatre Solihul, is set to star as the fairy this December. Scroll down for video . Kate Gilbert before (l) and after (r), has slimmed eight stone so she can slip into the outfit for her dream role . Kate, who has been part of the group for 12 years, struggled with her weight for a long time, especially since her hip replacement five years ago. The events manager said: 'I knew that it might be a struggle to convince directors that I was fitting to be cast as fairy when I was stomping around on the stage. 'Now I've never felt or looked better and I'm a much better fit for the Tinkerbell costume!' For years, Kate had been consigned to roles for women many years her senior. Her extra pounds meant she couldn't pass for characters her own age and she ended up masquerading as the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and the Red Queen in Alice and Wonderland. Desperate to prove that she had the looks as well as the voice to match the character, Kate began an impressive diet focussed on curbing carbs. Shge said at 22 st it might be a struggle to convince directors that she was fitting to be cast as fairy . She used to struggle to fit into public toilets and fitting rooms in shops . She went from indulging in multipacks of sweets and crisps every single day to not touching carbohydrates at all and ditching sugary snacks. Kate also returned to horse riding and now spends hours every week mucking out, riding, and tending for horses at her local stables. Her husband is also delighted with her achievement. She said: 'I used to struggle to fit into public toilets and fitting rooms in shops - it was so embarrassing. 'If someone had parked too close to me in a car park I risked getting stuck and found myself climbing in over the passenger side. 'I knew I had to take action especially because there were some roles that I hadn't got because of my size. 'Despite my weight I was getting strong roles and my singing voice was strong. But when I was a lot heavier I looked a lot older, so I ended up playing women who are meant to be twice my age. 'I can dance without being out of breath and run around the stage without worrying about putting my foot through a board. 'I look back and think, ""how can I have let myself get that way?"" Kate also returned to horse riding and now spends hours every week mucking out and riding . When she was heavier she looked older so ended up playing women twice her age . Kate said: 'I've done every diet under the sun - Weight Watchers, Slimming World, Lighter Life, Cambridge Weight Plan, even the cabbage soup diet - but never had much lasting success. 'Now I've managed to the simplest thing in the world, just cutting out carbs and exercising more, and it's worked. 'I see people squeezing between cars in car parks or struggling to find clothes to fit and I think 'That used to be me'. 'Now I'm the best I've ever looked and feel fantastic.' Breakfast: Two cups of coffee . Lunch: Two doorstep sandwiches with mayo, sweets, crisps, cake and a chocolate bar . Dinner: Large bowl of pasta with cheese cream sauce and extra cheese . Snacks: Yoghurts, chocolate, packet biscuits, large slice of cake . Breakfast: Two low fat sausages with one egg . Lunch: Chicken salad with a piece of fruit or yoghurt . Dinner: Beef stir fry with zero carbohydrate noodles . Snacks: A handful of nuts . Kate has done every diet under the sun but by cutting carbs and exercising she looks better than ever .

"A Los Angeles woman has created an Instagram account which allows women to share all of the weird, wacky - and sometimes downright horrifying - messages that they receive from men via dating websites and apps like Tinder. Alexandra Tweten created the Bye Felipe account as a means of allowing women to air some of their more outrageous online dating interactions, after realizing how many obscene and offensive messages she and her friends were receiving on a daily basis. 'I realized these hostile messages were a trend that women see online,' the operations coordinator told The Huffington Post. Bye Felipe: The account encourages women to bond over their shared online dating disasters . Rude and ridiculous: Some of the messages featured include insults about appearance, while others are aggressive and sometimes even violent . 'It shows our cultural misogyny problem': Alexandra believes there is a pattern to the behavior of many of the men featured, with the majority lashing out as a result of being rejected . 'That started a conversation about creating an Instagram to keep all of these insane messages so we could discuss them. All women get some degree of creepy or weird messages when they sign up for online dating sites.' Alexandra hopes that the account will help women who have suffered any kind of hostile or abusive dating messages to realize that they are not alone. And having sifted through a seemingly-endless stream of submissions, she points out that there is a clear and obvious pattern in the behavior of almost all of the aggressive messengers. 'It's a standard reaction that I've now seen over and over again with the submissions,' she added. 'Guy hits on girl, girl doesn't respond, guy lashes out with insulting message. It really shows the entitlement these guys feel, and I think it shows our cultural misogyny problem.' While some of the submissions featured are too rude to repeat, others are slightly more ridiculous and include a variety of extraordinary comebacks from jaded gentlemen, irate at the thought of being turned down. Mastermind: The account is the brainchild of Los Angeles-based operations coordinator Alexandra Tweten . 'I am not interested': A lot of the women who send in submissions to the account are very clear about their feelings early on in the conversation, however their honesty is rarely met with a reasonable response . Downright rude: Many of the women find themselves facing a barrage of indecent questions . One woman, after seemingly ignoring a man's advances, was told: 'Yeahhhh so I have come to the conclusion that you are a Class A b***h. With toe nail fungus and you probably like to eat Cheetos while you watch reruns of Gossip Girl.' Another, who dared to respond to one of the numerous insults being hurled in her direction, received a message telling her to 'cut her face off with a bottle'. Thus far the account has almost 26,000 followers, a number which is continuing to grow by the hour as word spreads to other disgruntled women. Alexandra is hopeful that it will have an impact on at least a few of the men who are featured - and perhaps even encourage them to change their attitude towards women and the online dating community. She said: 'Maybe a guy will see it and put a second thought into sending a woman a mean message.' Creeped out: Many men become instantly aggressive when a woman fails to show interest . Over-the-top aggression: In some cases, the woman doesn't .","Bye Felipe allows women to share the most outrageous messages that they have received via dating websites and apps like Tinder .

"First lady Michelle Obama has taken heat for her low-calorie and low-fat push in school lunchrooms and vending machines, but her punishing food austerity has spared the White House occupants whom her husband needs to please most: journalists. The White House press corps doesn't get many perks – tiny bathrooms, tinier cubicles and awful coffee are the norm –and reporters pay for their own snacks. But while soy chips and apple slices have replaced Kit Kat bars and Doritos in hundreds of thousands of vending machines nationwide, the one adjacent to the White House press briefing room has escaped untouched. One reporter snapped a photo of the machine's artery-clogging jackpot, a 590-calorie 'jumbo honey bun.' There was only one left in the machine, suggesting that it's among the most popular offerings. The pastry packs 17 grams of saturated fat, 360 milligrams of sodium and 30 grams of sugar. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Breakfast of champions? White House reporters, photographers and video camera operators have a smorgasbord of snacks to choose from that would make the first lady's blood boil . Power lunch: Mrs. Obama has championed the eviction of added fat, sugar and salt from school lunchrooms, but hasn't yet taken her food sledgehammer to the press corps that will help frame her husband's legacy . World Health Organization nutritionists recommend a daily sugar intake of 25 grams, and scientists at University College London recommended this week that a better target would be just 14 grams – an even more unrealistic number for most. But either way, a single honey bun would put a hungry deadline-driven journalist on Mrs. Obama's 'naughty' list. The Broad Street Bakery brand pastry sells for $1.50 and is made by Flowers Foods, which also manufactures Nature's Own breads and Tastykake snacks. Other Broad Street snacks available in the White House press snack machine this week included 'chocolate frosted creme cakes,' 'rich frosted mini donuts' and 'double chocolate cupcakes.' One member of the White House daily print press pool told MailOnline with his best Mel Gibson 'Braveheart' accent that 'the Obamas can take our weekends, and they can take our holidays – but they can't take away our gargantuan glazed donuts!' The journalist begged to not be identified, and MailOnline obliged. The new normal: Vending machines in American schools are now mostly chock full of healthier but less popular options . The first lady made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat. School nutritionists and foodservice workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs. Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a dramatic downturn in lunch sales. Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards. Mrs. Obama said in July that she would 'fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.' But for now, at least, she's leaving the journalists who will help frame the president's legacy alone. And that, said MailOnline's cheeky William Wallace impersonator from the White House press corps, is in the Obama administration's best interest. 'If they started rationing sugar and fat around here,' he grimaced, 'you'd have a lot of sluggish people in the briefing room when the 1:00 briefing starts. You don't want cranky, hungry reporters peppering you with questions. Of course, he added, 'we'd probably just double our coffee intake. Or open a bodega on the South Lawn.' Best option for White House correspondents if the snack machine should go the way of the ashtray? The black market, one reporter chuckles .","Decadent, gooey $1.50 treat also packs 30g of sugars and 360mg of sodium .

"'Illegal Pete's: 'llegal Pete's' owner Pete Turner is being urged to change the restaurant's name because it is 'dehumanizing' Colorado residents are urging a restaurant owner to change the name of his business due to its 'social context.' Pete Turner, owner of 'Illegal Petes', a Boulder-based restaurant chain serving oversized burritos, listened to a concerned crowd in Fort Collins Wednesday as they urged him to change the name of his business, saying it was offensive to immigrants, according to the Coloradoan. CBS Denver reports that nearly 50 people attended the meeting including community members and Colorado State University students and faculty. Turner reportedly told the crowd that the name is a literary reference to a bar in a novel he read as an English major in Boulder. Turner also told the crowd that he has helped pay for some of his employees to become citizens. But crowd member, Lucy Gonzales, 25, told Pete to drop the 'illegal' -- or 'I-word' -- in the name and many likened the term to racial slurs toward African-Americans. Kim Medina, Fort Collins immigration attorney and meeting moderator, said the issue was one of a social nature. 'Social context is hugely important,' Medina said at the meeting. 'We'll never get to big issues, such as immigration reform, until we can solve these smaller issues of language.' The meeting comes almost three weeks before Turner is scheduled to open a new 'Illegal Pete's' in the town, according to the Coloradoan. Turner's attendance at the meeting was prompted by a letter written to him from Antero Garcia, Colorado State University assistant English professor, the Coloradoan reports. In the letter, Garcia wrote: 'The restaurant will be located in the same area that current Fort Collins residents remember often seeing signs saying 'No dogs or Mexicans.' It is under this legacy of American racist practices that the name 'Illegal Pete's' becomes unacceptable.' And at the meeting, Garcia said that Turner's resturant would instill violence in the community. Fort Collins: Nearly 50 Fort Collins residents gathered at a meeting Wednesday to demand that Turner change the name of the restaurant, just weeks before the new location's opening . Reference: Turner said that the restaurant's name is a literary reference to a book he read in college and never intended to offend anyone . After many shared personal experiences about growing up in Fort Collins during times of harsh racial descrimination, Turner said he couldn't imagine living that way, CBS reports. Though  he could empathize with the group, Turner said he did not realize the issue was one regarding free speech and said he believes he has a right to name his business what ever he chooses. Cheryl Distaso, coordinator of the social justice nonprofit Fort Collins Community Action Network, said that the restaurant's name is dehumanizing and she is confident that Turner will 'do the right thing.' Locations: The restaurant has six locations in Denver and Boulder, the Fort Collins location would be the seventh with Turner planning to open an eighth in Tuscan, Ariz. Turner said at the meeting that he had a lot to consider when deciding whether to change the name of his restaurant. Medina said that, in the meantime, Fort Collins residents would be mobilizing themselves 'either to celebrate or to protest.' 'Illegal Pete's' has six locations in Boulder and Denver, Fort Collins would be its seventh location. Turner is planning to open another location in Tuscan, Ariz. as well.","Many are urging Pete Turner, owner of Mexican restaurant 'Illegal Pete's,' to change the name because it is offensive to immigrants .

"Top secret: The British Spy Manual was a compulsory read for members of the Special Operations Executive . From the cyanide cigarette to the deadly briefcase, the gadgets that Q presents James Bond with in each of the spy films are crucial to his operations. But according to a real-life spy manual, World War Two agents were using gadgets and devices which would give Bond a run for his money. The British Spy Manual – read and memorised by agents in 1944 and 1945 - reveals the secrets of how explosive rats, microfilm coded stilettos and exploding bottles of Chianti were all used to defeat the enemy. Members of the Special Operations Executive (SEO) could choose from explosives hidden in fruit, wine bottles, coal, handbags and even rats, according to The Sunday Times. Disguises were also extensive and included make-up, customised women’s clothing studied for accuracy from periodicals, and an early spray-tan that ‘sprayed through a glass nozzle will…produce a brown stain that would last approximately three days in Far East Climates’. In the ‘permanent removal’ section the manual also boasts how tattoo removal and dental work was available to SOE agents and that ‘an eminent plastic surgeon and his staff are at our disposal’. Collar-studs, buttons and high-heels could be tailored to carry codes or microfilm, and radio equipment was hidden in bundles of kindling, gramophone players and German clocks. In the introduction to The British Spy Manual, published later this month, Sinclair McKay writes: ‘In the Bond films the visits to the gadget laboratory was always a moment of light relief. Covert communications: One technique that was used by British spies was the camouflaged wireless radio, hidden among a bundle of kindling (as seen above) The idea for the 'exploding rat' was first developed in 1941. The objective was to blow up the enemy's boilers by lying the dead rat near German boiler rooms. Enemy soldiers were expected to shovel the carcass into the flames to avoid disease - the the hidden bomb's fuse would then be lit. But they were never used, as the first consignment was seized by the Germans, blowing the secret. ‘Yet in the real world of the SOE, the ingenious contraptions were deadly serious. 'These were not toys, but super-serious means of helping to ensure survival.’ The SOE was created in 1940 on the order of Winston Churchill and kept secret from parliament, and by the end of the Second World War it had led to the destruction of Hitler’s nuclear programme and the capturing of Nazis. The real life equivalent of Q, the head of the fictional Q development Branch in the James Bond films, was Charles Bovill, who also played a key role in the creation and employment of Eureka and the S-phone radio equipment for communications between SOE agents and troops on the ground. Exploding rat: One suggested technique for enhancing explosive capabilities was to hide a bomb in a rat carcass - the idea was that German soldiers would burn the rodent in their boiler rooms causing an explosion . Real life Q: Charles Bovill, who died in 2001 aged 90, was responsible for inventing many devices used by British spies .","Book reveals ingenious equipment and weaponry offered to British spies .

"Businesswoman Karren Brady took her seat in the House of Lords today with her friend and colleague Lord Alan Sugar by her side. The 45-year-old was introduced as Baroness Brady of Knightsbridge to a busy Hall this morning dressed in traditional red ermine robes. Flanked by her Apprentice co-star, Ms Brady swore her allegiance to the queen before being cheered by other peers. Scroll down for video . Karren Brady - now Baroness Brady of Knightsbridge - takes her seat in the Lords alongside her Apprentice co-star Lord Sugar . She is among 22 people announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in August to have received a Conservative Party Peerage. Ms Brady, who is from Birmingham but has a home in Knightsbridge, was also accompanied by co-chairman Lord Feldman of Elstree as she made her entrance. She was introduced as 'Baroness Brady, of Knightsbridge in our city of Westminster', but will be known simply as Baroness Brady. After repeating the businesswoman, signed the Upper House's code of conduct and then shook hands with Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza. She was then greeted by leader of the House Baroness Stowell of Beeston before leaving the chamber to change out of her robes. She then rejoined the Chamber to hear questions. It comes after Ms Brady spoke out in favour of stay-at-home mothers saying their work should not be underestimated or treated as menial. Ms Brady donned traditional ermine robes for the occasion, wearing her trademark hair in loose curls over a fur collar . Looking the part: The businesswoman prepares for her first appearance in the House of Lords this morning . The businesswoman is among 22 people who were announced as recipients of Tory peerages earlier this year . Baroness Brady of Knightsbridge, as she is now known, took her seat in the House of Lords today . The mother-of-two praised women who committed themselves to staying at home, admitting she found being a housewife 'unrewarding' when she spent five months away from work between 2009 and 2010. Speaking ahead of today's ceremony, the businesswoman, who became the managing director of Birmingham City FC at the age of 23, said she admired women who give up work to raise children. 'I had five months where I didn’t work and I found it really unrewarding. Because all the things you do at home are just taken for granted,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 'I think that's a great shame because actually being at home and dedicating yourself to your family is a wonderful thing and should never be underestimated. Baroness Brady, pictured third from left, rejoined the chamber after making her official entrance . Ms Brady, who previously said taking just three days maternity leave following the birth of her daughter was 'shameful', added: 'It's not something I chose for myself...But it's not menial work and it should never be considered as that.' Flanked by her friend and Labour Peer, Lord Alan Sugar and Conservative Party co-chairman Lord Feldman of Elstree, Ms Brady took her seat in the House today. All three were dressed in ermine robes as Lady Brady pledged her allegiance to the Queen. Since her early twenties the businesswoman says she has had to fight against gender stereotypes in the workplace after finding success in a male-dominated industry. After becoming the managing director of Birmingham City FC in 1993, she took the club from the brink of bankruptcy to an estimated worth of £82million. Karren Brady, pictured with her husband Paul Peschisolido and their children Sophia and Paolo, said staying at home to raise children should not be considered menial work . The 45-year-old was named in August among 22 new Conservative Party political peers selected by Prime Minister David Cameron. They are pictured together at the party's conference in Manchester earlier this year . She is now the vice chairman of West Ham United, sits on the boards of Phillip Green's Arcadia and Simon Cowell's SyCo and acts as Small Business Ambassador to the Government. But the businesswoman has expressed regret in the past for sacrificing time with her family to ensure professional success. Taking such a short break from work following the birth of daughter Sophie, now 18, was 'a mistake,' she said. 'That was shameful, really. It was a mistake and most people would look at it with shock, as they should.' Earlier this year Ms Brady revealed Sophia had been working part-time in a clothes shop near the family's Solihull home to learn about the working world, and is paying her way through a film studies degree with a student loan. She is the eldest of Ms Brady's children with her husband, former footballer Paul Peschisolido. The couple also have a 16-year-old son, Paolo. Speaking of her daughter's part-time job in Hollister, she said: 'It helped her realise there is a whole world outside school of different experiences and places.' After becoming the managing director of Birmingham City FC aged 23, Ms Brady (pictured in the role in the early Nineties, left) took the club from the brink of bankruptcy to an estimated worth of £82million. Today Brady sits on the board of various multi-million pound companies and acts as a Small Business Ambassador to the Government . Earlier this year Ms Brady was awarded a CBE for services to entrepreneurship and women in business by Prince William. Speaking of the accolade, she said: 'It has been difficult over the 20 years, things are getting better. 'But I think if women like me don't campaign for other women who's going to do it, so I take it seriously.' 'I think it's important that young women have good role models and it's important that if you put yourself forward as a role model you take that job seriously.' Ms Brady is among 22 new party political peers announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in August. There are 192 women in the House of Lords, the fewest belonging to the Conservative Party of which just 26 per cent of peerages belong to females.","Businesswoman was introduced into the House of Lords this morning .

"An Oklahoma man was charged Thursday with two counts of second-degree rape after police identified him by a tattoo on his penis, investigators say. Brandon Lee Aaron,  27, allegedly had sex with a 15-year-old girl who told police that Aaron had a tattoo of his ex-girlfriend's name on his penis, according to NY Daily News. Court records show that deputies saw the alleged tattoo after obtaining a search warrant for Aaron's body. Inked: Brandon Lee Aaron, 27, was linked to having sex with a 15-year-old girl after cops identified him by a tattoo on his genitals . Tulsa World reports that the Panama police chief found sexually explicit texts exchanged by Aaron and the minor referencing their sexual activity after the 15-year-old's sister reported the relationship to the police. After reporting the activity, the girl's sister helped police find Aaron, who was taken into custody after being found at a Panama apartment. The girl told investigators that she and Aaron had sex twice, according to Tulsa World. The most recent sexual activity between the two allegedly occurred during the weekend before Aaron was taken into custody; the other incident occurred in June. When police asked the 15-year-old if there were any scars or marks not visible with clothing she told them that Aaron had a tattoo of his ex-girlfriend's name on his penis. Custody: Aaron remains in custody at the LeFlore County Detention Center with bail set at $25,000 . Police say that Aaron initially denied having sex with the teen. However, an affidavit states that Aaron later admitted to having sex with the girl once in her sister's home and once in his mother's home. After his confession, Aaron reportedly told police he 'knew it was wrong' and made efforts to distance himself from the minor.

"The father of a five-year-old Australian boy who died in the family's litter-covered home said he allowed his children to live in squalor for fear his mentally ill wife would take them from him. The boy was illiterate, couldn't walk weighed just 42lbs when he died in 2012, after cutting his foot on a tin of cat food discarded in the filthy house, which was littered with rotting and spoilt food, mould, faeces and broken furniture. The father, who is in his 40s, said he allowed his two boys to live in squalor while he went to work a $160,000 (£88,104) because he feared they would be taken away, a Melbourne court has heard. The five-year-old boy died in 2012 after cutting his foot on an open tin of cat food that was buried beneath piles of rubbish on the floor in the Melbourne home . The Melbourne house was in such a terrible state at the time of the boy's death a judge said he couldn't see how anybody could perform basic tasks in it without having to suppress a gag. The father allowed his two boys to live in squalor because he feared they would be taken away, a Melbourne court has heard. He left the child-rearing to the boys' mother - a self-described 'deadbeat' - who suffered from severe mental health problems and threatened to remove them if he tried to get help, according to the man's lawyer. Victorian County Court Judge Michael Rozenes said the boy's father must have shut off his senses when he entered the house. 'There isn't a single square inch of that house where anyone can do that (perform daily tasks) without having to suppress a gag,' Judge Rozenes said at a plea hearing on Wednesday. The house has been described as being in a state of extreme squalor, littered with rotting and spoilt food, mould, faeces and broken furniture . The boy weighed 42lbs at the time of his death and had never been taken to a doctor, nor been registered at birth. The cause of death could not be determined but Crown Prosecutor Susan Borg told the court it could have been tetanus or botulism. 'Toxic gas produced by rotting food also could have been a factor,' Ms Borg said. 'He made a decision that it was perhaps easier not to go head to head with the mother.' 'The father went out into the real world to work, where he earned $160,000 per year, then returned to the filthy conditions but did nothing.' 'He did nothing to help those children,' she said. Ms Borg said he told police he did not feel responsible following the death and he and his wife had dedicated 'a big chunk of their lives' both financially and emotionally to their sons. Defence lawyer Hilary Bonney said the mother and father, who both pleaded guilty to two charges each of reckless conduct endangering their two sons, suffered from mental health issues. She said the mother was 'mad' and the father was scared to stand up to her. 'If he mentioned getting help out of the family she would threaten him and say she would take the boys away,' Ms Bonney said. The mother told the court 'deadbeat' when asked about her profession. The prosecutor says there faeces and rotting food were found at the home . The mother, who died of organ failure earlier this month, in particular was delusional and suffered from alcoholism,' she said. A court appearance in July had to be rescheduled after the mother collapsed in the dock, prompting calls for medical help. The father told police he believed the five-year-old attended kindergarten and his other son, now 10, went to school.' Neither attended school nor kindergarten and the youngest, who was born in the house, was never taken to a doctor and his birth was not registered, the court heard. 'He felt he couldn't combat her,' Ms Bonney said. '(He) was desperately holding on to his wife and his children.' Psychologist Elizabeth Warren told the court both parents had mental health problems. Crown Prosecutor Ms Borg said she did not believe it was necessary to impose an immediate jail term on the man, while the defence asked for a suspended sentence. She said the man has not seen his oldest son since the five-year-old's death and losing the boys was punishment in itself. The man, who broke down during the court hearing, will remain on bail until he is sentenced on November 27.

He said: 'I first carried this treatment out in the USA, now it's caught on at my clinic here and why not?

"Asda could face legal action from thousands of its shop workers amid claims that it pays female staff less than men. The action is being brought by checkout workers – predominantly women – who feel their roles are not considered of ‘equivalent value’ to those of higher paid, male-dominated jobs in warehouses. Law firm Leigh Day is pitching the case as one of inequality under equal pay legislation. Female checkout workers may launch a legal case against their employers amid claims male-dominated jobs in warehouses are valued more highly by the company than theirs . It hopes to sign up 10,000 of Asda’s 165,000 workers in a class action. What’s at stake is a difference of up to £4-an-hour – a sizeable amount for those working close to the minimum wage. The law firm is trying to draw similarities with the Ford strike of 1968 when women sewing machinists walked out of a factory in Dagenham after being told their jobs were to be reclassified as less-skilled than those of men working on the production line. At Asda, staff in the distribution centre are 80 per cent men – the checkouts are 60 per cent women. Asda claims that the skills required for the roles are different; warehouse workers need to be trained in how to use a forklift truck and health and safety regulations. A spokesman for the supermarket said it was proud of its record in anti-discrimination which it will defend robustly if necessary . Both men and women on the checkouts are part of the class action. They claim their roles require the same level of skill. A spokesman for Asda said: ‘We do not discriminate and are very proud of our record in this area, which, if it comes to it, we will robustly defend.’","Female workers suing over claims they are not considered equally valuable .

"An errant priest who resigned after admitting to having an affair with a parishioner has revealed he wants to stay in the church. Kieran Conry, 63 resigned as the Catholic Bishop of Arundel and Brighton last weekend when the husband of the parishioner threatened to sue the church over the bishop's relationship with the man's estranged wife. Despite that, the bishop said he has never thought about leaving the church. Kieran Conry (left) resigned as the Catholic Bishop of Arundel and Brighton after admitting to have an affair with parishioner Olivia Hodgkinson (right) - despite that, he said he wants to stay in the church . In an interview with the Sunday Times, Bishop Conry said: 'I've never regretted being a priest. I've never felt unhappy, I've enjoyed it and tried to do whatever was asked of me. 'I've always gone where I've been sent and I hope to do the same again.' The affair was exposed when Simon Hodgkinson hired a private detective to follow his wife, Olivia, when their marriage broke down. A second love affair six years ago also came to light and yesterday there were claims of a third woman in his life. The bishop decided to resign because it 'was the easiest way to avoid further embarrassment, disappointment...and shame for the church.' In his resignation statement he made a point of saying his actions 'were not illegal and did not involve minors.' Bishop Conry (pictured) said he will do any job that comes his way if he is allowed to remain in the church . Mr Hodgkinson realised his wife was being unfaithful when she failed to turn up for choir practice at their local church. The City executive said: 'I thought it was odd when she didn’t arrive at choir practice because normally she would never miss one. I went to her house to drop some music through her letterbox but she wasn’t at home. ‘By then it was about 10pm and I thought it was really weird. I decided it was time to test my suspicion that she was having an affair. ‘I went up to the bishop’s residence and her car was there. I checked and it was there all night. I was devastated. ‘I thought the bishop was someone who was honest and liberal. He is a man who has trained marriage counsellors – and is someone I had seriously thought of turning to for advice in relation to my own marriage. ‘Now, because he was such a powerful public figure, I could not go to anyone in the Church. I wanted to protect my family, I wanted to protect the children but I did not know what to do.’ Bishop Conry admitted the married mother-of-two had stayed over at his  detached home in West Sussex . The scandal has come at a time when the church is under growing pressure to consider relaxing its requirement for priests to remain celibate and to allow married men to become ordained. Bishop Conry told Margarette Driscoll, of the Sunday Times: 'When a priest makes a promise of celibacy, he promises to remain unmarried, that's all. Then the ordinary rules of morality apply. 'But I'd like to make it clear I'm not calling for a change. I did wrong. Celibacy may be a tradition rather than an article of faith but the vast majority of priests are faithful to their promise, faithful to what the church expects of them. And I have great respect and admiration for that.'","Bishop Kieran Conry, 63, resigned as the Bishop of Arundel and Bishop .

"A clever computer nerd has been hailed as Britain's toughest IT worker after winning a string of world titles for bodybuilding. By day Michael Perrin, 22, is a mild-mannered technical support worker used to dealing with PC troubles in an office. But at night he hits the the gym and transforms into one of the world's top bodybuilders. Scroll down for video . Michael (left aged 16, right, recently at British National Bodybuilding Federation championship) has totally transformed his body since he started body building at age 19 . Michael's extreme physique mean that he rather shows up his colleagues in the John Lewis head office IT department . He is now capable of lifting more than 500lb - the equivalent to an adult polar bear. Michael's extreme physique mean that he rather shows up his colleagues in the office as he taps away on a keyboard with his massive biceps bursting out of his work shirt. Michael maintains his muscled physique by working out five nights a week and eating a huge eight meals a day - each one specially designed to feed his massive muscles. He is is currently a Junior British and World Champion Powerlifter. Michael said: 'I'm just a normal guy with a hobby, really. Most IT workers like playing computer games in their spare time, while I love going to the gym and working out. Michael, seen here showing his muscles to full affect at a competition, can lift weights the equivalent of an adult polar bear . 'It's quite funny to see colleague's reaction when they call for IT support and I show up. I think people expect us all to look like the guys from The IT Crowd. 'But you could say I am probably Britain's toughest IT geek.' Gentle giant Michael, who still lives at home with his parents Karen and Tim and sister Kelly, in Sutton at Hone, Kent, works in the John Lewis head office IT department. To maintain his muscles Michael trains for hours five days a week and has to eat eight meals a day . Some of the many trophies won by Michael during his short bodybuilding competitive career . Last year the muscle man, who only took up competition bodybuilding aged 19, won the Junior World Bodybuilding Championship, held in Miami, Florida, and later this month he is returning to America to try to defend his title. At the British Junior Powerlifting Championship Michael managed to deadlift an astonishing 507lbs (230kg). He can also bench press 350lbs (158kg) and squat 430lbs (195kg) - despite weighing only 188lbs (13st 6lbs) at competition weight. He said: 'I couldn't do what I do without the help and support of my co-workers, and most importantly my family. 'My parents and sister are so supportive - I don't think I'd be strong enough to do it without them. Michael, left, pictured with his mother Karen who helps him prepare some of his eight daily meals . 'My mum helps me prepare all my food, but she does get a bit annoyed sometimes because the fridge is always filled with my Tupperware.' Proud mother Karen, 49, said: 'We've gone all over the world to support Michael. 'I'm so proud of him. The fact he's doing it naturally, with no performance-enhancing drugs, is all the more impressive. Unsurprisingly Michael admits he gets an odd reaction when he arrives as IT support at work . Michael can deadlift an astonishing 507lbs (230kg), bench press 350lbs (158kg) and squat 430lbs (195kg) 'Steroids ruin lives, and I'm glad my son only enters competitions which have strict drug tests.' Michael reckons a career in IT is perfect for him, because he's always been interested in computers. He said: 'At school I was never really the best at maths, science or English, but computers really made sense to me. 'I was a big fan of IT, so once I got my A-levels, it seemed the perfect career for me. 'It's funny at work now, because people are so careful of what they say to me about their IT issues. 'Despite the fact I wouldn't hurt a fly, I think my size is quite intimidating. 'There's another guy at work who is small and slight, so people jokingly ask for the 'little one' if their problem is something quite simple to fix.'","Michael Perrin works in the IT department at the John Lewis head office .

"A growing school has relieved classroom pressure by turning a double-decker bus into a fully functioning teaching space. When headteacher David Godfrey found there was no room in his primary school for extra lessons, he bought the bus on eBay, ripped out the old seats and replaced them with desks and a plasma TV screen. Children at Central First School in Ashington, Northumberland, are now studying in the double-decker which accommodates around 15 pupils and took two months to renovate. Pupils from Central First School in Ashington, Northumberland, lining up to board their bus classroom . Students pictured during class on the bus. The top level (pictured) can accommodate a dozen people . The bus cost £5,000 to buy and another £3,000 to be refurbished into a suitable learning environment . Although the bus cost £5,000 and the transformation a further £3,000, it has still worked out much cheaper than building an extension and Mr Godfrey said his pupils love studying in the vehicle. Mr Godfrey said: 'With the pupil premium we get from the Government we can employ the staff but we didn't have any quiet areas to hold extra lessons. 'We had literally turned toilets and cupboards into working spaces, and we started to look at the alternatives. 'There are a number of TV programmes out there which have been really innovative with their use of space. 'I have quite a lot of creative people around me and we thought, well you get double your money with a double-decker bus.' Jodie Johnson, 6, added: 'I was a bit nervous when I first got on the bus now I love it. We do lots of fun activities here.' Mr Godfrey had looked into constructing a new build or renting porta cabins but said the cost of this ran into the hundreds of thousands. Pupils boarding the bus in anticipation of a lesson aboard the unconventional classroom . The bus was driven up from London earlier this year and was previously used to ferry festival goers around the Isle of Wight . So earlier this year he came up with the novel idea of buying the bus and transforming it into a state of the art working space. The bus is a fully functioning classroom throughout the whole school day with lessons of up to 12 being held on the top deck and smaller groups of two or three downstairs. Mr Godfrey said: 'Some of the teachers were a bit unsure to begin with, but they have now completely come around to the idea. 'The children absolutely love it. It is a novelty for them to come and take their lessons in the bus.' The bus was driven up from London earlier this year after it was bought by the school, which consists of around 550 pupils, and had previously been used to ferry around festival goers on the Isle of Wight. The engine has now been decommissioned and it looks as though the vehicle, which dates back to the 1980s, is set to stay for good.","Primary school headteacher  bought bus and turned it into a classroom .

"Cruel parents who kept their child locked in a cage are being investigated by police in Mexico City. Mother Lisette Guzman Montoya, 28, and father Menajem Jurado, 33, were exposed after a local political party's campaign team knocked on their door in the district of Miguel Hidalgo. Politician Evaristo Roberto Candia Ortega, who later tweeted a photo of the boy, said: ‘Our people knocked on the door and as they waited they heard a child crying. Evaristo Roberto Candia Ortega tweeted this shocking photo of the abused boy in a bid to help police find him and bring his 'drug addict' parents to justice in Mexico City . ‘When they looked round the corner of the house they saw a little boy standing in a cage weeping with a dog chained to it.’ After getting no response from knocking on the door, the campaign team decided to take a photograph of the shocking scene. As they did, somebody came out of the house and was very aggressive towards them. ‘It was clear to my party colleagues that the man was either on drugs or very drunk,’ said Candia Ortega. 'I find it disgusting that anyone would lock up their child and leave him in those conditions,' said Evaristo Roberto Candia Ortega . The campaign team decided to leave and called the police. When they returned with the police the place was empty and both the child and dog had gone. So far the police have failed to find the boy or his parents and as a result Candia Ortega had decided to post the photograph on Twitter. ‘I put the photograph onto Twitter because I want these people found,’ he said. ‘I find it disgusting that anyone would lock up their child and leave him in those conditions.’ According to Candia Ortega, his team spoke to the parents' neighbors who told them that the couple were drug addicts and often put the boy inside the cage because they didn't want to look after him. He described their actions as ‘deplorable.’ Local police have said they are doing everything possible to find the boy and charge his parents. ‘We are aware of who these people are and are diverting resources into finding them as quickly as we can so that the little boy will be safe,’ said a police spokesperson. In June, police in Mexican town of Xalapa found a four-year-old boy who had been chained to the bars of the balcony as a form of punishment.","Evaristo Roberto Candia Ortega tweeted the shocking photo in a bid to help police find the abused boy and bring his 'drug addict' parents to justice .

"Four years ago this month, archeologists monitoring the excavation of the former World Trade Center site uncovered a surprise - part of an ancient sailing ship. At 22 feet (6.7 meters) below today's street level, in a pit that is now an underground security and parking complex, work was forced to stop as excavators uncovered the ancient ship. Researchers were baffled by the vessel, but a new study has finally revealed how old the ship was - and how it came to be under the site. Scroll down for video . The entire ship was scanned before its removal to create a precise record of where each of its pieces were originally found . Surprise: The ship was found four years ago, as workers were excavating the site . The ship itself has been tentatively identified as a Hudson River Sloop, designed by the Dutch to carry passengers and cargo over shallow, rocky water. After 20 to 30 years of service, it is thought to have sailed to its final resting place in lower Manhattan, a block west of Greenwich Street. As trade in New York harbor and the young country flourished, Manhattan’s western shoreline inched westward until the ship was eventually buried by trash and other landfill. By 1818, the ship would have vanished from view completely until the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 set in motion the events leading to the World Trade Center’s excavation and rebirth. The team were able to analyse tree rings on the wooden 'skeleton to show the boat came from wood cut in Philadeplhia in 1773. Tree-ring scientists at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory were among those asked to analyze its remains for clues about its age and origins. Researchers at the lab dried the fragments slowly in a cold room and cut thick slices of the wood to get a clear look at the tree rings. In a study now out in the journal Tree Ring Research, the scientists say that an old growth forest in the Philadelphia area supplied the white oak used in the ship’s frame, and that the trees were probably cut in 1773 or so—a few years before the bloody war that established America’s independence from Britain. The ship itself has been tentatively identified as a Hudson River Sloop, designed by the Dutch to carry passengers and cargo over shallow, rocky water. A team of archeologists with New York-based AKRF and others worked from dawn until dusk cataloging each timber and artifact before hauling the pieces off site. Dated: Researchers in a lab dried out the wood fragments and cut them into thick slices to get a clear look at the tree rings . Work stopped: Construction on the site had to stop so the boat could be taken out of the ground by archeologists . Archaeologists were on-site throughout the excavation of the World Trade Center's Vehicular Security Center. They found animal bones, ceramic dishes, bottles and dozens of shoes. However, they were shocked to find the 32-foot-long (9.75 m) partial hull of a ship. The vessel was quickly excavated, to prevent damage from exposure to the air. Piece by piece, the delicate oak fragments were scanned and taken out of the rotten-smelling mud. The ship was perhaps made from the same kind of white oak trees used to build parts of Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution were signed. The key to the analysis was wood sampled from Philadelphia’s Independence Hall two decades earlier by Lamont tree-ring scientist Ed Cook, according to the researchers. Growth rings still visible in the building’s timbers matched those from the World Trade Center ship, suggesting that the wood used in both structures came from the same region. As trees grow, they record the climate in which they lived, putting on tighter rings in dry years and wider rings in wet years. In the process, a record of the region’s climate is created, allowing scientists to see how Philadelphia’s climate differed hundreds of years ago from say, New York’s Hudson Valley. An array of munitions were also found on board, including a French-made cannonball and the American-made musket balls pictured. The ship¿s frame was riddled with small holes, suggesting it had spent time in the Caribbean, a hub in the rum, sugar and slave trade at the time. Teredos, or shipworms, are native to the salty, warm waters of the South Atlantic Ocean . The climate fingerprint also serves as a kind of birth certificate, telling scientists where pieces of wood originated. The ship itself has been tentatively identified as a Hudson River Sloop, designed by the Dutch to carry passengers and cargo over shallow, rocky water. It was likely built in Philadelphia, a center for ship-building in Colonial times. Several ring patterns matched oak timbers found in Philadelphia¿s Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution were signed. Lamont-Doherty scientist Ed Cook sampled Independence Hall in the late 1980s while amassing his North American Drought Atlas; those records would be crucial in tracing the World Trade Center ship¿s timbers to a dense, old-growth forest near Philadelphia.

"A High Court judge today ruled that a little boy with brain damage should be taken off a life-support machine despite his parents' pleas to keep him alive. Specialists had told Ms Justice Russell that the youngster - who turned one earlier this year - had suffered irreversible brain damage and it was in the youngster's best interests for live-sustaining care to be withdrawn. However, the boy's devout Christian parents - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - disagreed. Today the youngster's father said no-one had the right to take away the 'privilege' of life from his son. In words that echoed those of the parents of five-year-old cancer victim Ashya King, whose family fled the UK after disagreements with the NHS over his treatment, the baby’s father had said they had been made to feel ‘our child is not our child anymore’ by doctors who gave ‘no consideration’ to their feelings. A mother told the High Court (pictured) that ‘miracles do happen’ as she pleaded for the life of her son . Ms Justice Russell analysed the one-year-old boy's case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London today - after an application by the NHS foundation trust which runs the hospital where the youngster is being cared for. The judge gave the trust permission to withdraw life-sustaining ventilation - and said she had reached the decision 'very sadly' and with 'great reluctance'. Ms Justice Russell today thanked the parents for speaking to her and for the 'dignified' way they had conducted themselves. 'This case is unbearably sad,' she said. 'The parents don't agree to the withdrawal of ventilation. They love their son and believe that he responds to them. 'As committed and devout Christians they don't feel they have the right to agree to life-sustaining treatment being withdrawn. 'It is their belief that given time God may work a miracle. I have nothing but sympathy for them and admire the love and devotion they have shown. 'The parents believe in the possibility of recovery. That is not the opinion of the medical experts.' She said she had to gauge what was in the little boy's best interests after balancing medical evidence against his parents' views. Ms Justice Russell ruled neither the boy, his parents nor the trust could be identified. The restriction relating to the naming of the trust would remain in force as long as the boy was alive. Lawyer Clare Watson, representing the trust, told Ms Justice Russell that the boy was born prematurely by emergency Caesarean section in 'poor condition' and he required resuscitation and ventilation at birth. Ms Watson said in late 2013 he had suffered an 'acute cardio-respiratory deterioration', which required him to be 'mechanically ventilated once again'. She said he was 'ventilator dependent' and his condition had not improved despite 'on-going intensive care'. Doctors had concluded that there was no prospect of recovery. However, Ms Justice Russell also said there had been 'multiple failures in the multi-disciplinary team caring for him' and the boy went into a period of cardiac arrest lasting about 20 minutes. The case echoes that of five-year-old cancer victim Ashya King (pictured), whose family fled the UK after disagreements with the NHS over his treatment . Ms Watson told the court that an investigation was carried out and said the 'trust have endeavored to be entirely transparent about what has gone wrong'. Justice Russell accepted that the trust had been transparent and had not 'tried to cover anything up' but said what happened had 'affected the way his parents feel about his treatment - as it would'. The boy's mother told Ms Justice Russell: 'At the end of the day he is still alive. The ventilator is helping and supporting that life. Where there is life, I don't think you should get the right to determine whether that should be taken away.' She said she had seen her son's eyes move and added: 'We believe that (he) does respond to us as parents. We don't feel that the trust has the right to end his life because he has got brain damage.' The mother said she believed that her son might recover to the point where he could experience the 'pleasures of life'. 'He is still alive,' she told the judge. 'Miracles do happen.' The boy's father told the judge that no one knew a child better than their mother and father. He said: 'Even though he is going through all these problems, he still knows ... what is going on. This child still feels. I spend a lot of time with him, talking to him. I know when he is listening ... We know he is reacting to certain things. 'He still has life. We don't have the right, as parents, as individuals, to take this privilege from him.'","High Court judge orders brain damaged child's life support to be turned off .

"A Tennessee patient who was put in isolation and tested for Ebola does not have the deadly virus, their results last night revealed. The unnamed individual, from Memphis, was quarantined at Methodist University Hospital in what officials called 'an abundance of caution' after falling ill with symptoms of the disease. Despite not meeting all of the qualifications for Ebola, the patient was blood tested and quizzed on where they had recently traveled and who they had been in contact with. But last night, their test results confirmed they have not been struck down with Ebola, which has so far killed 4,922 people, mainly in the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

And instead of taking pictures of the famous UN World Heritage Site, these sightseers can be seen  snapping shots of the flood of visitors.

China's Great Wall was swamped with millions on one day during the country's annual week-long holiday . Sixteen million people visited the Great Wall - frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space - throughout the country's annual week-long holiday, which started on 1 October, Rocket News 24 reported. It's the highest visitor number for five years. Known as the 'Golden Week', the holiday was created by Chinese Communist Party officials to promote tourism within the country. Huge crowds: The UN Heritage site reportedly attracted  16 million visitors during 'Golden Week' celebrations . Less frenetic: The Great Wall was started in 500 BC and was built to fend off foreign invaders . The plan however has caused major problems for the tourism industry as it struggles to cope with the huge number of visitors. All across China tourism destinations reported record numbers, but the flood of tourists has meant that attractions have been jam-packed and locals have had to face huge traffic delays on all transport networks.

"After a century and a half of holding onto its secrets, the recently decoded diary of Confederate officer James Malbone reveals he wrote his Civil War diary in code to conceal juicy camp gossip. Sprinkled amid entries on camp recipes and casualties are encrypted passages in which Malbone dishes on such juicy topics as a fellow soldier who got caught in bed with another man's wife. Malbone also writes about meeting the wife of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and describes her looks in an apparent echo of rumors at the time that she may have been of mixed race. Diary: James Malbone, an officer in the Confederate army, kept a diary where he recorded recipes and lists of deserters, as well as gossip written in code . 'That's pretty shocking,' said Kent D. Boklan, the Queens College computer science professor and former National Security Agency cryptographer who deciphered Malbone's code with little difficulty. 'It's a military diary and you expect military information, but you don't expect the first lady of the Confederacy to make an appearance in this diary,' he said. According to Boklan, Malbone's encrypted entry about Varina Howell Davis describes her as 'dark complected' with 'very very brown skin dark eyes' and 'high cheek bones wide mouth.' Davis' wife was a well-educated woman for her time, and as a result, was the target of 'all kind of gossipy innuendos from the ladies' in Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, according to Sam Craghead of the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond. Malbone, a lieutenant with the 6th Virginia Infantry Regiment, was severely wounded in the arm at the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863. Assigned to light duty behind the lines, he used a leather-bound pocket diary to jot down his thoughts and even a poem. Simplicity: Kent Boklan, a former cryptologist for the National Security Agency, said the code is not difficult to break, with symbols substituted for letters of the alphabet . Secrets: The diary was likely acquired by a soldier from New York and wound up in the state's collections, before a volunteer discovered the code . President: Jefferson Davis was the first and only president of the Confederate States of America, whose wife was rumored at the time to be of mixed race because of her darker skin and dark eyes . Many of the entries were in a code he devised himself, consisting of a variety of symbols, including punctuation marks and a dollar sign, that corresponded to letters of the alphabet. Other entries — names of deserters, costs of supplies — were written in plain text. This was because the diary would have been submitted to his superiors so they could copy the information for their records, says Jim Gandy, librarian at the New York State Military Museum. Gandy said the journal probably came into the possession of a New York soldier at the end of the war and wound up in the state's vast collection. It is the only Confederate diary in the museum. There is no record there of Malbone's ultimate fate. It wasn't until 2012 that a museum volunteer discovered the diary was written partly in code. The museum contacted Boklan, who had broken Union and Confederate codes used in other documents, and he completed the deciphering after working on it for a week in January. 'Technically, this is not very hard to break,' Boklan said. 'There were some odd things. With a little bit of work and patience everything worked out.'","James Malbone began writing in a leather-bound journal after being severely wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville .

"After missing yesterday's engagements due to a sinus problem, the Duchess of Cornwall pulled out all the stops to look her very best as she and Prince Charles continued their royal tour of Mexico. But Camilla was left blushing for all the wrong reasons when she turned up in a stunning creme ensemble - which was almost identical to her host's outfit. Standing beside Gretta Salinas de Medina, the First Lady of Monterrey, the pair looked the mirror image of one another, as they made their way around the industrial city in northern Mexico. The duo wore a matching string of pearls and discreet pearl-coloured earrings to complete their outfits. Scroll down for video . Standing beside Gretta Salinas de Medina, the First Lady of Monterrey (pictured with Camilla), the pair looked the mirror image of one another . Camilla was left blushing for all the wrong reasons when she turned up in an almost identical outfit to her host . The Duchess and First Lady board a London bus during the visit to the northern city, before Camilla quipped 'are we going to zoo?' The duo wore a matching string of pearls and discreet pearl-coloured earrings to complete their outfits . Ms Salinas - the wife of the governor of the local state of Nuevo Leon, Rodrigo Medina - even had her remembrance poppies fitted onto her blazer in the same position as Camilla. The outfit faux pas took place on the final day of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall's trip to Mexico. For her last day, the duchess left her chauffeur driven car behind - and hopped onto a London bus. Camilla boarded the red routemaster during the visit to the northern city, before quipping 'are we going to zoo?' Seeing a London bus under grey skies after a downpour, the duchess probably felt the city was a home from home. The number 7 bus - emblazoned with the route London to Monterrey - took her a short distance across Fundidora Park, built on the site of industrial works and now home to a museum showcasing the heavy industry of the area. They stepped off at a canal in the park and took a pleasure cruise around a series of waterways which featured cultural performances of dances and musicians along its route. At one point when they hit choppy waters Camilla pulled a face as if a little concerned. The routemaster was restored to its former glory by plastic surgeon Angel Tobar, 50, who bought it for his artist wife Marissa, 49, to use as a mobile gallery. The outfit faux pas took place during the last day of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall's trip to Mexico when Camilla boarded a red routemaster bus . He said: 'This is the first time the bus has been used and it was used to take Camilla on a trip - so that's a nice way to begin.' Camilla sat on a makeshift seat in the bus built in 1948, as all the rest had been removed to make the routemaster into a mobile gallery. Mr Tobar bought and restored the London bus for around 125,000 US dollars (£100,000) just over three years ago and spent the last two having it rebuilt. He said: 'My wife found it on the internet it was in Arizona, it was taken from London in the late 1960s and it was originally owned by the man who bought London bridge. 'He didn't want it any more and sold it to someone else and that person sold it to us.' The Duchess of Cornwall also took a guided tour via canal boat with her host . The duchess waved enthusiastically to those waiting to catch a glimpse of the royal visitor . But she appeared to find parts of the trip somewhat unnerving, as shown by her concerned expression . When Camilla first arrived with Charles at the industrial museum they were greeted by a group of performers, Ballet Folkloric Monterrey, who wore traditional costumes from the state - Stetson hats and tasselled jackets for the men and long flowing skirts for the women. Inside a former steel foundry the royal couple saw displays showcasing local produce, dishes and crafts, from ornately decorated saddles to a traditional breakfast meal of eggs, dried beef, and onion. The Governor of the local state of Nuevo Leon welcomed the prince and duchess in a speech and Charles spoke a few words in Spanish in return: 'Thank you for your kind welcome, Governor. My wife and I are delighted to be here in Nuevo Leon for the first time, on the final day of our visit to Mexico.' The pair watched the Ballet Folkloric Monterrey at the Parque Fundidora  in Monterrey . The matching women were joined by the Prince of Wales to view a market exhibition . The market showed regional culinary traditions - which Prince Charles appeared to enjoy getting stuck into . As Charles and Camilla's four-day tour of Mexico came to a close, Duncan Taylor, Britain's Ambassador to Mexico, said the royal couple had been well received. He said: 'The crowds of people we saw in all the regions we visited prove that there is real affection for their royal highnesses here in Mexico. 'They have visited iconic places that represent the rich diversity of this country but they have also taken so much time to meet members of the community. 'I am confident that this royal visit will give a significant boost to the relationship between our countries. A historical relationship that has been characterised by mutual respect, co-operation and friendship.' The royal couple went on to meet local children, who waved Union Jack flags excitedly . Duncan Taylor, Britain's Ambassador to Mexico, said the royal couple had been well received in the country . No doubt their lasting impression had something to do with the Prince of Wales showing off his fancy footwork a day earlier, when he delighted groups of locals with a spot of traditional dancing. Charles didn't have to be asked twice when the performers asked him to join them during a visit to the picturesque coastal town of Campeche on Mexico's Caribbean coast. Twirling a handkerchief above his head and copying the men and women around him, a beaming Prince of Wales deftly tapped his feet to the music as he took part in the dance, known locally as a Sarao Campechano. The Prince of Wales had the Mexican town of Campeche in a spin when he showed off his fancy footwork and joined locals for a dance . The Prince tapped his feet to the music as he took part in the dance, known locally as a Sarao Campechano . Charles' close encounter with Mr Zamorano and his troupe of dancers came as he visited Campeche's main town square, where he was scheduled to tour a number of craft stalls while meeting local dignitaries. The large crowds waiting to see Charles were being entertained by the dance troupe, who were dressed in traditional costumes, when the royal arrived and joined in the dance. Delighted, the crowd roared their approval before the Prince gave one final twirl and moved on, looking thrilled but more than a little relieved. The Duchess of Cornwall had been unable to who was forced to cancel her engagements on the penultimate day of the couple's Mexican tour because of a sinus problem. Clearly unhappy to be without her, Prince Charles offered a brief comment on the health of his, pointing to his ear and saying: 'Sinus, such bad luck'. Charles laughed as he performed the movements and looked a little relieved when the dance came to an end . Charles earned the praise of dancer Carlos Javier Zamorano, 20, who joined in to help the Prince along .","Camilla wore same outfit as First Lady of Monterrey Gretta Salinas de Medina .

"Alex Scott, who has been jailed for six and a half years, after conning passengers at Gatwick Airport out of £13,500 . A TV star police community support officer has been jailed after conning passengers at Gatwick Airport out of £13,500. Mother-of-two Alexis Scott pocketed the cash when she told people coming through the airport that they were carrying too much money and ordered them to hand it over. The scam was uncovered when returning passengers began asking airport officials for their money back. The PCSO had featured in a 2011 documentary called Inside Gatwick where she was filmed talking proudly about her work. But today Scott was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail after being convicted of theft at Canterbury Crown Court in July. The sentence will mean that the 40-year-old will be separated from her baby daughter after judge James Mahoney said any jail term exceeding three years would see the mother and child split up. Sentencing a sobbing Scott, of Plumstead, south-east London, the judge described the difficultly in striking a balance between public interest and what was best for the family. He said: 'I have human feelings, I am a father. 'If it (the sentence) is more than three years the child is going to be taken from the mother. The judicial duty doesn't come harder.' Members of Scott’s family broke down and left the courtroom wailing in distress as the judge handed down a sentence of six-and-a-half years for misconduct in a public office, and two-and-a-half-year terms for each of the six counts of theft, to run concurrently. The judge also said Scott’s actions damaged the reputation of the police force and of this country. He added: 'It was over a limited time that you did this but it was bold, persistent, systematic, planned and subtle. 'You preyed on [victims’] lack of sophistication and panic. 'This is a case about an official PCSO using her uniform and her status to commit serious criminal offences herself. Scott was arrested in May last year after the scam, where she told passengers at Gatwick that they were carrying too much cash and needed to hand it over . In 2011, the mother-of-two had featured in a TV documentary called Inside Gatwick, where she proudly talked about her work . 'It is an exceptional and very usual case. The implication is upon the police, the public trust and the international reputation of this country. 'People from other parts of the world find themselves being fleeced by a police officer. If that’s the impression that people leaving this country go away with then that’s a very serious matter.' Scott was arrested in May last year on suspicion of stealing more than £15,000 from seven victims. She was convicted in July of six offences of theft and one of misconduct in public office following a three-week trial. Scott was cleared by a jury of one count of theft. Her victims lost £13,500 in total, money which has now been paid back by Sussex Police. Defending, Alexia Power said character references spoke of her client as a 'warm, kind-hearted woman who would do anything for others'. Scott said being in prison with her baby, who was conceived before being charged, had 'kept [her] going'. The scam carried out by Scott, left, was uncovered when returning passengers began asking airport officials for their money back . Miss Power added: 'The overwhelming picture from these references is that Miss Scott acted wholly out of character. 'She has brought up a young child, struggling with debt.' The judge ordered Scott, who has no savings, to pay a nominal fee of £1. It means the full amount can be recovered as and when she accumulates it. Judge Mahoney also praised members of the investigation team at Sussex Police for their work. Following the verdict, Deputy Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said Scott had fallen woefully short of the 'highest personal and professional standards' expected by Sussex Police, abusing the trust the force had placed in her and the trust of the public. After internal disciplinary proceedings in July last year Scott was dismissed from her job, which pays a basic salary between £18,500 and just over £20,000 a year. She had previously been a member of a specialist investigation team which confiscated cash from suspected criminals.","Alexis Scott pocketed the cash while working as a PCSO at Gatwick Airport .

"Mystery: A neighbor of John Sheridan (pictured) and his wife, Joyce, told a 911 dispatcher last month that he heard someone banging on the door inside the couple's home during a fire . A neighbor reporting the fire that killed the president of a major New Jersey hospital and his wife last month told 911 dispatchers that he heard banging coming from inside the house. On the tape released by investigators Wednesday to Philadelphia Inquirer, the neighbor can be heard saying that he saw smoke coming from the home of John and Joyce Sheridan and ‘somebody's trying to get out, they're banging on the door.’ Earlier this month, investigators ruled that fire had been intentionally set in a Montgomery Township home where 72-year-old John Sheridan lived with his 69-year-old wife. Mr Sheridan was president and CEO of Camden-based Cooper University Health Care, which has more than 700 physicians and serves more than half a million patients a year. Sheridan, a Republican, also had ties to Governor Chris Christie and served as general counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. Police and firefighters responded to reports of a fire at the Sheridans’ home on Meadow Run Drive at 6.15am on September 28. Authorities said the fire was contained to the master bedroom, where firefighters found the unresponsive couple. The husband was pronounced dead at the scene, while his wife, a retired schoolteacher, succumbed to her injuries at a hospital a short time later. The couple's neighbor, who called 911 that morning after smelling something burning and hearing the sound of a smoke alarm going off, told the dispatcher that when he knocked on the Sheridans' front door, he could hear what he believed to be a person trying to get out of a room upstairs, . Capt. Jack Bennett, a spokesman for the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office, responded to the claims made by the neighbor on the 911 recording by saying that what the man heard were actually the sounds from the raging fire, and not a person banging. John Sheridan, 79, was pronounced dead on the scene, while his wife, Joyce, 69, succumbed to her injuries a short time later at the hospital . Outpouring of grief: People file past a portrait of John and Joyce Sheridan into a memorial service for the couple at the War Memorial October 7 in Trenton, New Jersey . Well-connected: George E. Norcross III (second from the left) praised Sheridan (left) in a statement on his death. The men are pictured here with New Jersey governor Chris Christie (second from the right) Police and fire investigators have been tight-lipped about the details of the case, declining to divulge anything beyond the fact that the fire was set intentionally, and that there was no threat to public safety. Law enforcement officials have said they were awaiting additional test results and a report from the medical examiner's office to shed light on the Sheridans' cause of death. By all accounts, John Sheridan was a well-connected political figure with many powerful friends in the GOP, including four New Jersey governors. The Sheridans’ joint memorial service in Trenton last week drew hundreds of mourners, among them Chris Christie and four of his predecessors, former governors Jim Florio, Christine Whitman, Tom Kean and Don DiFrancesco. ‘He was one of those public servants in the best sense of the word because he loved the state,’ Whitman told 6ABC, referring to John Sheridan. ‘He was a Republican, but he never served for the Republicans, he served for the people. Sheridan has been credited with helping revitalize Camden – a hard-scrabble, poverty-ridden city best known for having the highest crime rate in the nation, according to FBI statistics. Friends in high places: The Sheridans' memorial drew hundreds of mourners, among them Governonr Chris Christie and four of his predecessors . Sheridan, who had been a partner in a law firm for many years before taking over the Camden-based health system, served as transportation commissioner under Governor Kean and was part of gubernatorial transition teams for both Whitman and Christie. Speaking at the couple's memorial in Trenton October 7, Governor Christie said: ‘I can’t imagine the pain and the loss that the Sheridans are feeling right now,’ according to NJ.com. The couple are survived by four grown children and three grandchildren. Their son Mark Sheridan currently serves as general counsel for the New Jersey Republican State Committee. A statement issued by the Cooper University Health System last month said the organization was 'saddened to announce the death' of Sheridan and his wife. 'There is no one else who has had as big an impact on me as John did except my father,' said Cooper Health System board of trustees chairman George E. Norcross III in the statement. Adrienne Kirby, president and CEO of Cooper University Health, remembered Sheridan for his 'quiet strength, his decisiveness and his passionate belief that Cooper not only could make a difference in people’s lives, it had an obligation to do so.' A Montgomery Township police officer sits in front of the partially burned home of John and Joyce Sheridan, who were found unresponsive inside their bedroom early Monday, September 29 . Blaze: Fire officials discovered two fatalities at the address listed for Sheridan in Montgomery, New Jersey, according to campaign contribution records . Sheridan was praised for getting the first new medical school in three decades built in New Jersey, having helped bring plans for the Cooper Medical School at Rowan University to fruition in 2012. 'Perhaps his greatest contribution to the larger Cooper community was his commitment to helping revitalize Camden,' the statement said. 'There was never a day that went by when he wasn’t focused on what Cooper could do to help revitalize the city that he loved.' Camden mayor Dana Redd released a statement of condolences as well. 'They will both be profoundly missed by the entire Camden community,' wrote Redd. 'I have personally known John Sheridan since 2001. We worked closely as Cooper enhanced their campus and during the early planning stages of the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University.' Sheridan began in law after graduating from Rutgers Law School. He later worked his way up to co-chairman at law firm Riker, Danzig, Riker, where he was also senior partner. He began at Cooper in 2005 as senior executive vice president, moving up to chief administrative officer and then president in 2007. Before Cooper, he served as general counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike authority and sat on the board of trustees at the Carrier Clinic.","The house fire that killed John Sheridan, Jr, and his wife, Joyce, last month has been ruled an arson .

Personnel carry out duties on board the hospital ship RFA Argus today (left and right) as it prepares to leave its home port of Falmouth . Strict rules to keep the ship ‘sterile’ from Ebola include banning personnel from going ashore on leave during up to three months of deployment. Royal Marines who leave the RFA Argus for operations in the local community will go through a decontamination process upon their return. Medics will take their temperatures twice a day and anyone who shows signs of Ebola will be flown to a British treatment clinic in Kerry Town. Captain David Eagles, 52, of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, admitted the measures were ‘tough’ but necessary to safeguard against Ebola. ‘It is a ship that's there for six months but people will rotate round on a two to three month basis,’ said Capt Eagles, of Hatt, Cornwall. ‘No shore leave is unusual, it will be quite tough but I think people will understand. I think people are going to be quite busy. David Eagles, captain of the RFA Argus, docked in Falmouth, stands on deck as the crew prepare to set sail .

The ship with a fully-equipped 100-bed hospital on board is being loaded to be sent to Sierra Leone, along with three Merlin helicopters . Royal Navy and ship personnel receive a briefing  as they prepare to set sail on Friday to assist with responding to the epidemic . ‘We are working to allay fears. The point we have been getting across to our people is that Ebola patients will not be brought aboard Argus so we are a sterile unit from that. ‘The risk that people have cottoned onto is what happens if one of the ship's crew comes into contact with Ebola in the local community.’ Capt Eagles said all Royal Marines leaving the ship will be given a questionnaire on their return - with the first question: ‘Have you been in contact with a local population?’. ‘If a “yes” comes across then straight away alarm bells are ringing,’ he added. ‘His temperature will be taken twice a day and he will be well and truly monitored. ‘If he shows any signs whatsoever the level of scrutiny will increase ten-fold, our medical experts will make a decision to transport him back ashore to the UK facility at Kerry Town.’ Capt Eagles said this early detection process would mean the patient would be removed from the ship before they became infectious. Today, 120 members of the ship's company were given a 90-minute briefing on Ebola from three medical experts inside the crew's canteen.

Dr Ruth Howlett-Shipley, the Royal Navy's Public Health Consultant, told the personnel: ‘We are doing everything we can to make sure that you go out safely and come back safely. ‘To contract Ebola you have to have direct contact with someone who is ill with Ebola.’ Dr Howlett-Shipley was asked questions including: ‘If I sit next to a Royal Marine at breakfast, who shook hands with an infected person, will I contract Ebola?’ Surg Lt Dan Hawkins, 34, from Evesham, Worcs, the medical officer on the ship, admitted members of the crew had ‘concerns’ ahead of deployment. ‘Everyone is focused and looking forward to it in a serious way but there are very genuine concerns,’ he said. ‘But it is no different to being put in harm's way in any other environment. The thing I am most worried about as the ship's doctor, is malaria.’ The ship will act in three capacities in Sierra Leone, where it is expected to remain for six months, to support the Department for International Development. The ship, due to set sail on Friday, will not be used to treat Ebola-infected patients, but mainly to transport supplies and ferry personnel .

The ship will act in three capacities in Sierra Leone over a six-month period, to support the Department for International Development . It will provide three Merlin helicopters to transport equipment in the country, as well as allowing Royal Marines to safely move stores into areas they are required. The 35-year-old former container ship will also act as a hospital for non-battle injuries and diseases for British troops, providing the same level of care as a NHS trauma hospital in the UK. Medics such as emergency consultant surgeons, anaesthetists, ITU nurses and radiographers will have access to a wide range of diagnostic facilities including a CT scanner. Speaking aboard the ship, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon described the ship as ‘the front line in defending Britain from this disease’. ‘This is a vital mission to save lives in Sierra Leone but also to keep Britain safe,’ he said. ‘If this outbreak is not kept under control then we will see it spread through Africa, into mainland Europe and the UK. ‘Members of the armed forces know they are putting their lives at risk all the time in all kinds of operations.

The vessel will not be used to treat Ebola-infected patients, but mainly to transport supplies and to ferry personnel. Capt Eagles said: 'We have a considerable education programme in place to reassure personnel and their families about how you actually catch the disease and that it's quite difficult to catch it. 'As we head south towards Sierra Leone will be doing a lot of training to make sure our plans are validated and we know how to deal with any emergency that may come our way.

'I'm confident we can deliver the mission successfully and safely and bring all our people safely back home.' Defence Secretary Michael Fallon laid out the measures at an emergency Cobra committee meeting last week, chaired by the Prime Minister, to discuss the UK's response to the Ebola crisis, which is being led by the Department for International Development. Mr Fallon said: 'The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is already a global threat to public health and it's vital that the UK remains at the forefront of responding to the epidemic. 'Following today's meeting we are stepping up significantly the UK's contribution and leadership in work to tackle the outbreak on land, in the air and at sea. 'At the heart of the package is the commitment to provide more than 750 personnel to help with the establishment of Ebola treatment centres and an Ebola training academy. 'We are deploying troops, helicopters and a ship - army medics and Merlin helicopters supported by RFA Argus - to provide direct support and reassurance.'","British personnel  subjected to 'tough' regulations while aboard medical ship deployed to tackle Ebola, captain says .

"It's no treat for a Southern California Halloween lover after police shut down his gigantic music-and-light show. Kevin Judd has been banned from turning on the 12,000 lights to create the display at his friends' home in Riverside. The lights were synchronized to music, such as Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' and the 'Nightmare Before Christmas'. Scroll Down for Video . Raging: The light display at the house synchronizes with Billboard hits to set off an arresting sight . Last week, Judd and his friends Melanie and Mark Betty began offering a half-hour nightly show. Hundreds of people showed up with their kids to dance or hang out at a nearby park. But on Sunday, police responded to noise and traffic complaints and shut down the display. Judd says it's disappointing and he isn't sure whether he'll stage more shows next year. Judd says he might look into getting a permit or renting commercial space. 'It’s really disappointing,' said Judd, 42, said Monday to The Press Enterprise. 'Screaming moms and dads (during ballgames at the park) are louder than our shows.'

So popular: Children from the neighborhood gather to party outside the house and are disappointed it has stopped . For the kids: Kevin Judd told CBS LA that he was annoyed that his gift to the neighborhood has been cancelled . Each of the half-hour dispays would begin at 7.30pm and would run a show each night apart from Saturdays, when Judd would do three. The lights were cleverly synchronized to music and would draw crowds of hundreds, especially families. However, over the past two weeks, police dispatchers have been receiving calls from neighbors upset with the noise and lights. The complaints have been sufficient to shut down the display and some are not happy. 'It’s great for the kids,' said Raul De La Torre, who lives next door. 'But I could see that it wears on people.' Judd has said he is not giving up and will seek a permit fro next year.

"Plus-sized Australian women are turning to online shopping in order to avoid confrontation and ridicule from sales staff when asking for sizes above 12. In a social experiment conducted by A Current Affair, Rebecca Turner - a size 16 - revealed that in the none of the nine stores she visited were able to offer her the same selection of clothing marketed to smaller women. More often than not, staff would either ignore Ms Turner or simply turn her away from their store. Scroll down for video . Lisa Manu  (left) and  Rebecca Turner (right) revealed that they've been ignored and ridiculed by sales assistants when they ask for sizes larger than 12 . Ms Turner said the whole shopping experience is disheartening for her. 'I'm ignored and I have people looking me up and down,' she said. In one instance, Ms Turner tried to stay in the vicinity of a shop assistant to see whether she would be approached. 'I purposely went towards her and she turned her head and found a different person – a smaller person to go and help in the shop,' Ms Turner said. Another case showed a staff member trying to convince Ms Turner to buy an item that was too small for her, saying 'it will stretch'. Size 22 Lisa Manu, who recently lost 50kg, has had similar experiences. 'I literally dread going to the shops,' she said, referring to one particular incident that left her red-faced. 'As I walked in the two young girls were leaning on the counter said: ""as if we've got anything in here for her"",' Ms Manu said. It's for this very reason she now chooses to do her clothes shopping online and she's clearly not alone. A shop assistant tries to convince Ms Turner to buy item that's too small because it will 'stretch a little' Ms Turner desperately searches for a decent piece of clothing that's in her size . A Current Affair reported that the average Australian woman is a size 14 with research showing that a third of plus size women are buying online - a warning for retailers to keep up with the demands or risk losing business. Ms Turner simply wants to have the same shopping experience as any other Australian woman. 'I don't want to be hiding under a sack, I actually want to show off my curves and my healthy body,' she said. 'If you haven't got that life experience to shrug it off and you are a little bit vulnerable or younger, it can be really detrimental to your whole body image and your whole outlook on life' Founder of Fame and Partners, Nyree Corby, saw a demand for a plus size range which prompted her to launch a new sizeable line of formal wear. 'Women in general deserve better,' Ms Corby said. 'They deserve to feel empowered and beauty after a shopping experience and that goes for a size 4 girl all the way to a size 26 girl,' she said.

"AUGUSTUS: FROM REVOLUTIONARY TO EMPEROR By Adrian Goldsworthy (Weidenfeld & Nicolson £25) The Roman emperor Augustus surely has a good claim to be considered the greatest leader in history. At 18, he made himself undisputed ruler of Rome and the most powerful man on Earth, governing an empire that was not only mostly peaceful, but prosperous under him. Not bad for a sickly teenager, whose eyes were described as being as widely spaced a horse’s, and whose limbs were marked by scaly skin. At 18 Augustus made himself undisputed ruler of Rome and the most powerful man on Earth . His rise to power followed years of bloody civil war. Not everyone supported Augustus’s rule, but most agreed it was preferable to continuing slaughter. Grateful Romans hailed him as the son of a god and father of his country. In private, as ancient historians such as Suetonius record, they identified more pungent qualities, among them his taste for married women and a vicious temper. Goldsworthy’s preferred description of Augustus is ‘warlord’. Ambition, political acumen, sleight of hand and plenty of good fortune smoothed Augustus’s path to supremacy. For almost six decades he dominated the violent world of Roman politics. Underpinning everything was military support on an unprecedented scale. Despite a dodgy track record on the battlefield — he had a knack of falling ill and missing the worst of the fighting — Augustus was a military dictator. He worked hard to keep Rome’s armies on his side. Augustus was as slippery as any politician. He devised an approach to government that was transformed into a one-man tyranny by his successors, including the lunatic Caligula. Under Augustus’s heirs, the Empire had all the trappings of monarchy, despite Augustus claiming that he had restored the Republic, a system intended to prevent excessive power on the part of any individual. Goldsworthy’s is not a radical reinterpretation of Augustus. He presents a man who, in his youth, was ruthless, cruel and occasionally vindictive. With age came mellowness and, for much of the time, a velvet glove disguising the iron fist. For good measure, he commissioned splendid buildings, restored temples, improved the road system and struggled to clean up elections. He also did his best to improve Rome’s morals, despite the many affairs that punctuated his 50-year marriage to Livia, whom he stole from a fellow senator. He even banished his own daughter and granddaughter on charges of adultery. Ambition, political acumen, sleight of hand and plenty of good fortune smoothed Augustus’s path to supremacy . Goldsworthy’s aim is to examine the Roman emperor as if he were the subject of a modern political biography. He mostly succeeds. At times, Augustus disappears from view, victim of the author’s relish for the details of warfare. After 2,000 years, and with patchy source material, it is impossible to identify Augustus’s motives clearly, beyond concluding that he was spectacularly determined and a workaholic. Goldsworthy’s mastery of his material is assured. He is undoubtedly correct to demolish many of the more colourful rumours reported by ancient historians. Suetonius, for example, claimed that Augustus tore out a rival’s eyes with his own hands on a misplaced suspicion that the man intended to stab him, and that he once offered to have sex with an older politician in return for 3,000 gold pieces. As a result, Goldsworthy’s Augustus is a more elusive, less likeable character. Matthew Dennison is author of The Twelve Caesars (Atlantic)","At 18 Augustus made himself undisputed ruler of Rome .

"STANLEY I RESUME: FURTHER RECOLLECTIONS OF AN EXUBERANT LIFE  By Stanley Johnson (Robson Press £25) The start of the second volume of Stanley Johnson’s memoirs finds him alone in his house in Exmoor on his 40th birthday having just been dumped by his American girlfriend, Bobby. Sitting at the kitchen table, feeling uncharacteristically glum, he tries to work out what, if anything, he ever did for her. At first his mind is blank. Then, with a tiny glimmer of pride, he remembers that he once helped her to resurface a tennis court. Later on, to buck himself up, Johnson goes off to do a bit of tree-trimming with a chain-saw. ‘I decided to attack a large, solid branch some 20 feet off the ground. Unfortunately, it happened to be the one I was sitting on.’ Some people, rather unkindly, have suggested that Stanley is a paler version of his son, Boris but it seems he is in a class of his own . Some people, rather unkindly, have suggested that Stanley is a paler version of his son, Boris — a kind of early draft of the real thing. But as swiftly becomes clear, when it comes to inserting every last millimetre of his foot into his mouth, Stanley is in a class of his own. To begin with at least, barely a page goes by without some example of his forgetfulness, clumsiness, or incompetence, all driven home with a liberal smattering of exclamation marks. Soon after Bobby dumps him, he meets his new next-door neighbour in London — a slim, dark-haired woman called Jenny. Keen to ingratiate himself, Johnson offers to take her two dogs for a walk. Within seconds of letting the dogs out of the car, he manages to lose them both. Jenny, however, is evidently the forgiving type. Not long afterwards, they get married. Stanley pictured in 1980. Much of Johnson’s life has passed in a chaotically unreflective whirl, unimpeded by any self-doubt, he does have his serious side . When he takes his children on a motor boat, the engine drops off; when he helps himself to a midnight snack at the house of some friends, he destroys their fridge; when he’s asked to come out to Nairobi to do a piece on animal migration, he gets on a flight to Houston instead. But while much of Johnson’s life has passed in a chaotically unreflective whirl, unimpeded by any twinge of self-doubt, he does have his serious side. As he’s keen to remind us, he was an MEP for five years, sitting in ‘the second-safest Euro seat in the EU’, and when he was in Brussels, he proposed several important pieces of legislation, all to do with animal welfare. If you’re going to read about the inner workings of the EU, then Stanley Johnson is probably as good a guide as any. Even so, there are several times here when his normally bouncy prose style seems to have put on a large pair of diving boots. ‘I have already mentioned that I was responsible for drafting the European Community’s Fourth Environmental Action Programme (4EAP),’ he notes at one point. Indeed you have, indeed you have . . . Mercifully we don’t stay stuck in the EU quagmire for too long. Inbetween drafting environmental legislation, Johnson writes a number of novels — one of which, The Doomsday Deposit, must be a leading candidate for the most unappealing title ever published. Another, The Commissioner, was made into a film starring John Hurt. ‘You can still buy the video on Amazon,’ he notes helpfully. But anyone who thinks that writing a novel automatically involves being plunged into creative agonies should think again. Rather than sit down and sweat at a desk, ‘I bought a pocket Dictaphone and spouted away in taxis or airport lounges’. Not surprisingly, the results were somewhat patchy: ‘Once I even forgot what sex one of the key protagonists was.’ Although it seems barely credible, Johnson won the Newdigate Prize for poetry when he was at Oxford. His fondness for versifying has not dwindled with the years and he includes some examples of his efforts here. I’ll spare you these on humanitarian grounds, but suffice it to say that the Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, is unlikely to be shaking in her shoes. Johnson and his wife Jenny who he met after offering to take her dogs out for a walk, but then lost both of them . Along the way he manages to father another two children, to go with the four that he had with his first wife. It comes as no surprise to learn that Johnson couldn’t remember their names when he was being interviewed on live TV, prompting one of his daughters to burst into tears. ‘How could you, Dada?’ she sobbed. ‘How could you forget our names like that?’ Johnson has a spasm of guilt, but like any dark cloud in his life it soon passes and his normal sunny surface is resumed. As for his theories on child care, these seem unlikely to find much favour with Dr Maggie Atkinson, the Children’s Commissioner for England: ‘Having had a great deal of experience of such matters, I have long since concluded that there is absolutely no need to be within earshot of young children.’ But he’s clearly done something right. All his children seem cheerful, bright and well-adjusted, albeit hell-bent on world domination. The ambition, as far as he can tell, comes from Stanley’s French mother, who taught him that ‘basically anything was do-able and that, as she would put it, there is no such word as can’t’. By the end of this maddeningly uneven yet still thoroughly engaging book, Johnson has brought his story up to date. At 74, there is no dimming of the light, still less any desire to slip into the shadows. Recently, he and the former BBC foreign correspondent Kate Adie were guests on the TV game show Pointless, which, he writes, ‘goes out at 5.15 every afternoon and apparently has between five and six million viewers’. And then he can’t resist adding: ‘We very much hope to be invited back.’","Some people have suggested that Stanley is a paler version of his son .

"A ballsy testicular cancer survivor is raising awareness of the disease  by pushing a 6-foot inflatable testicle across the United States. Thomas Cantley, 31, believes his life was saved by early detection of the disease so he is on a mission to prevent the rest of the male population from letting testicular cancer go unnoticed. He started his journey in Santa Monica on September 3 and is headed to New York with the giant flesh-colored ball, while explaining his mission to the people he meets and encouraging them to sign the inflatable testicle. Thomas 'Ballsy' Cantley is taking on the United States with giant inflatable testicle Lefty after creating a partnership with The Testicular Cancer Foundation . Thomas, who has earned the nickname Ballsy, was busy working as a filmmaker and photographer in New York when he noticed a gnawing pain in his groin and abdomen in 2009. But he told Men's Health he ignored the warning signs until his left testicle swelled to the size of an orange and became excruciatingly painful. 'I couldn't even put pants on,' he said. 'I was screaming.' When Thomas finally went to the doctor he was diagnosed with Stage 3 testicular cancer, which had spread to his lymph nodes, . He was told that had the cancer been left  untreated, it would spread through his body and eventually to his brain and would have killed him. Surgeons in his home town of Halifax, Nova Scotia, operated on Thomas to get the testicle and the infected lymph nodes removed. Project Ball Push started in August in Canada as he trekked with Lefty to Vancouver, pushing the ball during the day and towing the ball with a donated car at night . Thomas, 31, believes his life was saved by early detection of the disease so he is on a mission to prevent the rest of the male population from letting testicular cancer go unnoticed . 'Cancer was my rebirth,' Thomas told the magazine. 'I need to be infectious . . . I need to create attention. 'It's my reincarnated left testicle,' he says of the giant ball. 'I call him Lefty.' His project Ball Push started in August in Canada as he trekked with Lefty  to Vancouver, pushing the ball during the day and towing the ball with a donated car at night. Now Thomas is taking on the United States, after creating a partnership with The Testicular Cancer Foundation, A+ reported. Thomas accepts food, shelter, and gas, along with a promise to be proactive about  health issues . 'There's not very many young men advocates, that are coming in with a little bit of an edge,' he told the magazine in an interview. 'A lot of them are older. I kinda wanted to hit the demographic. I've been doing it for a couple years, but I realized I needed to get out there more.' He explained that he's raising awareness because he does not want other men to get to the point he was at, where it's almost too late. 'When I was diagnosed, I didn't want to talk about it, I pushed everyone out of life,' he said. Thomas, pictured here with a filmmaker pal, explained that he's raising awareness because he does not want other men to get to the point he was at, where it's almost too late. Thomas has already covered 1,680 miles across America. The entire campaign is funded by the generosity of the people he meets along the way, whether they have a connection with cancer or simply believe in his cause .

"Christopher Howard (pictured) was sentenced this week to three years of probation after he was caught having an affair with a student . A married band teacher was sentenced this week to three years of probation after he was caught having a sexual relationship with one of his female students. Christopher D Howard, 35, was even named 'teacher of the year' at Jacksonville High School just a year before the affair with the unidentified student was revealed. Howard's actions are even more damning considering he appears to have been married at the time. Public records show he got married in 2007, and there is no evidence that he and his wife have yet divorced. The two were living in the same address at the time of the affair. A deputy in the Onslow Coutny Sheriff's Office first discovered the relationship on May 23, 2012, when he found the two together in a parked car  in a deserted area. The student subsequently told detectives that Howard was her teacher, and that she had made physical contact with him that day by hugging him and kissing him on the cheeck. Upon a second interview, she admitted to having a sexual relationship with Howard. Howard also confessed to the inappropriate relationship when questioned by police. He said he was her teacher and had known her for several years. He says their relationship turned sexual after he helped her deal with some 'personal issues'. However, he said he had been wanting to end the relationship and had just broken up with her the day he was caught. That didn't stop prosecutors from charging the band director in 2012 with three counts of sexual activity with a student by a teacher and four counts of taking indecent liberties with a student. Prosecutors accused Howard of having sex with the girl multiple times, including once in the school's band room. This week, Howard pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a student and was sentenced to 36 months supervised probation. 'Due to their hard work, this defendant will not be able to teach or be left alone with any more students,' District Attorney Ernie Lee told the Star News. Howard was named teacher of the year at Jacksonville High School in 2010- 2011, just one year before the relationship was revealed .","Former teacher Christopher Howard, 35, pleaded guilty to  sexual activity with a student on September 25 and he was sentenced this week .

"The loss of a Sydney man's cat spurred him to make sure other pet owners never went through the same pain he felt when his feline 'best friend', Rango, went missing. For the past year, Sebastian Langton, 33, has been developing a GPS pet tracker that is believed to be the smallest, lightest and fully waterproof in the world. The Pod, which is a size of a cork and weighs just 29 grams, is cylindrical and can be strapped onto a pet to track its movements. Scroll down for video . The loss of Sebastian Langton's cat spurred him to create a GPS tracker for other pet owners . The Pod is no larger than a wine cork and weighs only 29 grams to ensure it can be comfortably attached to a pet's collar . To help fund the project, Mr Langton and his partner, Damien Cantelo, started a crowdfunding campaign on the Indiegogo website, which has raised more than $100,000 - double what they had set out to raise - at the time of this article's publication. The idea for the Pod came about when Mr Langton, from Kirribilli, lost his tabby cat and best friend, Rango, in 2013. He said for three days he was 'distraught' and hoping his cat of two years would return. '[Rango] was just everything to me. He was so cool,' Mr Langton told Daily Mail Australia. Rango went missing in 2013 and was later found dead on the side of the road by a stranger . Mr Langton and his partner decided to crowdfund some of the development of the tracker . So far, the campaign has raised more than $100,000, which is double their initial goal . 'We used to hangout in cafes and he used to ride on the motorbike with me to work.' Unfortunately for Mr Langton, Rango was not found alive. 'I was notified by a note pinned to a tree that said a person had found beautiful tabby cat on the side of the road,' Mr Langton said. 'It was the most heart-wrenching thing, you never get to say goodbye properly. 'I'm not saying the Pod would have saved Rango, but it would have helped me make sure he was safe. 'It would have allowed me to find him straight away and be there for him.' Mr Langton has described Rango as the 'coolest cat in the world' and his 'best friend' Rango would ride on Mr Langton's motorbike and chill out with him at cafes . The tabby cat had only been with Mr Langton for two years before he went missing . The Pod uses GPS technology which allows pets in another state or country to be detected via an application on a mobile phone or computer. Mr Langton - who had previous experience with GPS technology - said a lot of his money and his team's had gone into readying the product for launch, including research and development, product design and initial testing. The money raised by crowdfunding was for the mass production of the Pod to ensure the device was in people's hands by Christmas as well as improving it. Mr Langton said he was blown away by the support he had received for the project. 'It's fantastic. Anybody backing what you have created and supporting you, it matters a lot to me,' he said. 'It's a real passion project. It's not something I've come up with randomly.' The 33-year-old said they were also looking to align themselves with a charity so proceeds can also go to them.","Sydney's Sebastian Langton developed the Pod after he lost his cat in 2013 .

"Three-year-old Rayden Kahae has fulfilled every young boy's dream - to become a superhero. This footage shows the touching moment the youngster was given a new Iron Man themed prosthetic hand. Captured on camera by his father Moses Kahae, the touching moment shows the youngster playfully hiding his face behind his new hand. He looks on in awe as he flexes his newly found fingers. Scroll down for video . Rayden Kahae beams as he poses wearing his new Iron Man hand, built using a 3D printer . The three-year-old was born with amniotic band syndrome which meant he was missing fingers on his right hand, left. But now the youngster can ride a bike, catch a ball and perform a series of everyday tasks, using his new Iron Man hand, inspired by his favourite superhero, right . Rayden, who lives with his family in Hawaii, was born with amniotic band syndrome, which meant he was missing some fingers on his right hand. As he gets to grips with his new hand, Rayden is learning to ride a bike, catch a ball and perform other everyday tasks out of his reach before his new prosthetic arrived. And he has become the envy of his classmates, all excited at their friend's new superhero-style hand. It is inspired by Rayden's favourite superhero, Iron Man, resembling part of the suit worn by the character in the popular films and comics. It is thanks to the pioneering charity, E-Nable the Future, that Rayden can now experience a whole new lease of life. After researching the development of mechanical hands on the internet, Rayden's grandmother, Rulan, managed to get in touch with E-Nable's volunteer online community. Made up of engineers, physical therapists and designers, the kind-hearted community use revolutionary 3D printing to build prosthetics for children around the world. By following downloadable instructions and watching tutorials on the video sharing website, YouTube, volunteers can build their very own prosthetic limbs for around a mere $50. Unable to afford a custom built prosthetic arm, designer, John Peterson, managed to save Rayden's parents thousands of dollars in expenses. The hand was given to Rayden by the charity E-Nable the Future, a community who use revolutionary 3D printing to build prosthetics for children around the world . Rulan said: 'Almost daily Rayden would ask if his Iron Man hand had arrived in the mail, every box he saw us carry into the house, he immediately thought it was his Iron Man hand. 'The evening the box came in, Mom, Dad and siblings all surrounded Rayden in anticipation of him opening the box. 'When his Mom put the Iron Man hand on Rayden, he immediately closed the hand and began playing with it and staring at it. 'He held his own hand and told his parents ""I can hold my own hand"", then started using both of his hands to hide his face. 'He started showing off his hand to his baby brother too, you could see the excitement in his wide, bright eyes. 'Rayden's still learning to use his Iron Man hand on a daily basis, because the muscles in that arm were never really used before, it will take a little time before he'll be really comfortable with it. 'Now instead of being teased at school for not having fingers, he is stared at for his cool hand.'","Rayden Kahae was born with amniotic band syndrome, which meant he was missing fingers on his right hand .

"For Dennis, 20, from the port of Kolding in southern Denmark, balloons are more than just a party favour - they're a way of life. One of a growing number of 'looners' worldwide, Dennis and girlfriend Lila, 21, are sexually attracted to the rubber inflatables and say that the toys play a key role in their private life. Strange though it might sound, the couple insist that not only is their penchant for balloons harmless, it's completely normal as well. Happy: Dennis, 20, and girlfriend Lila, 21, are 'looners' and confess to being obsessed with blowing up balloons . That, however, is not what Dennis thought when he first realised he had an unusual interest in balloons as a teenager. 'I was just continually inflating this balloon and feeling it against my body and then suddenly, it was just the most fantastic and extraordinary thing I have ever tried,' he says of his eureka moment. But his euphoria soon gave way to fear. 'The way I felt after I found out that I had this special interest in balloons was that I was a freak,' he admits. 'I felt that I was standing out. And I felt most of all that I was alone.' But, as he soon discovered following a foray onto the internet, he wasn't. Indeed, as Denis soon found out, he wasn't even unusual. The 'looner' community worldwide is thought to be approximately 250,000 strong, with men outnumbering women by 30 to one. Passion: According to Dennis, different colour balloons have different meanings for him . Community: There are an estimated 250,000 looners worldwide, with men outnumbering women by 30 to one . Despite sounding like an internet-fuelled phenomenon, looners have also been around for more than three decades, with the first looner club, Buster Bill's Balloon Buddies, launched in 1976. 'A looner has a special interest for balloons,' he explains. 'We use balloons as a sexual aid and we see balloons differently than most other people do.' For her part, girlfriend Lila had long harboured a fetish for latex outfits and voluptuous gentlemen but all that changed when she met Dennis. Now a committed looner herself, she says she enjoys being able to combine her penchant for chunky chaps with balloons. 'I love that my man is big,' she smiles. 'It's just who I am and I love big things. I see the balloons a little bit like a man, a big man who I am trying to make a little love with.' So what exactly does being a looner involve? According to Dennis, much of it revolves around blowing up balloons and cuddling them, although colours do, apparently, make a difference. Not so good: Dennis prefers balloons made from natural latex as the party variety are too easily popped . 'What turns me on about a balloon is mainly the expansion part of it,' he confesses. 'I am very fascinated that such a small thing can grow into being huge  without having to explode, although they do, of course, explode occasionally. 'Every colour wakes up a feeling inside of me,' he adds. 'The yellow colour makes me happy. And then there is these red and black colours as well which are like: ""I'm naughty. Do whatever you'd like to do with me"".' 'Balloons are brought out during special times, which is one thing that would make it more likely to be a fetish object than something you would see every single day,' comments sexologist and sociologist, Dr Carol Queen. 'Part of the thing that makes a balloon fetish too is that many look as though they're a sexual shape. Many balloons are very breast like. Others are buttock-like.' Regardless of what shape they are, Dennis, who prefers special balloons made from natural latex, says he won't be giving up his penchant for inflatables any time soon. 'If I had to choose between Lila and my balloons, then I would of course choose her first,' he muses. 'But if there wasn't any other way of doing it, I would probably just hide it and do it by myself.'","Dennis, 20, and Lila, 21, from the port of Kolding in Denmark are 'looners'

"These horrifying pictures show the pitiful state of a pet Alsatian that had to be put down after it scratched the skin of its face – because owners didn’t take it to a vet for eight years. Kevin and Agnes Stringfellow, both 51, were both charged with failing to protect their dog Spike, a German Shepherd, and causing him unnecessary suffering. A worried shopper spotted the dog, who had been suffering from chronic facial dermatitis, in a car in Bolton, Greater Manchester, with no fur on its face and its skin was inflamed and infected. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Spike, the German Shepherd, had been suffering from chronic facial dermatitis and had to be put to sleep . They alerted officers at the RSPCA who were left shocked, with one inspector describing it as the worst skin condition she had ever seen. Burnley Magistrates Court heard the couple are married but live separately and the dog spent most of his time with Mrs Stringfellow – who is said to have a mental health problem. Spike had last been taken to see a vet for the facial condition in 2006 but had not been seen since. By the time RSPCA officers were alerted the dog was in such agony that the vet decided it had to be put out of its misery. The charity’s prosecutor, Christopher Wyatt, told the court: ‘Some of the staff at the veterinary practice had to leave the room as they were so upset at what they saw.’ Mr Wyatt added that the facial dermatitis was a long-term condition. The dog had not been to see a vet for eight years and its owner thought the problem 'would sort itself out' A witness saw the animal in a vehicle on the car park at Tesco in Horwich, Bolton, on April 12 and was so concerned she took the registration number and contacted the RSPCA. An inspector later went to Mrs Stringfellow’s home in Earby and was shocked when she saw the dog. It had no fur on its face and the flesh was exposed and red raw, with scabbing. The inspector couldn’t see the dog’s eyes. Agnes Stringfellow, the dog's owner, did not attend the hearing but the case was proven in her absence . He added that the inspector spoke to Mr Stringfellow on the phone and he said Spike’s skin condition had been ongoing for about three or four months. He said his wife had been looking after the dog for 12 or 13 years and that the animal had been taken to the vet about six years ago, but it had not been back since. Mr Stringfellow gave the inspector permission to take the dog to experienced vet, Shaun Taylor in Bury. He reported Spike was aggressive, in obvious discomfort, restless and scratching and had been suffering for at least a month. The inflammation was across most of its face, fluid was coming out and it was infected. The prosecutor added: ’The dog was in a state.’ He decided Spike really needed to be put to sleep to end his suffering, which Mr Stringfellow agreed to. A check was made with the vet Mr Stringfellow said he had taken Spike to who confirmed they saw the dog in 2006 for the condition but had not seen him since. When Mr Stringfellow was interviewed, he said the skin condition had got worse over the last six months. He said he didn’t take the dog to the vet as he thought he could sort the problem out himself. Mrs Stringfellow was not interviewed, despite attempts by the RSPCA to do so. Mr Stringfellow, from Colne in Lancashire, admitted failing to protect Spike from pain, suffering, injury or disease by failing to get proper and necessary veterinary care and attention, between October 16, last year and March 16 and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal between March 16 and April 16, this year. The self-employed dairy engineer, was banned from owning or keeping dogs and cats for 10 years and cannot apply for the order to be lifted for five years. He was made to pay compensation - the vet’s fees of £320.63 - and £600 costs. His wife, of Earby in Pendle, who was accused of the same allegations, did not attend the hearing and the bench found the case against her proven in her absence and adjourned it until October 17. Mr Stringfellow, who was not legally represented, told the court: ‘I’m very sorry. It wasn’t done with any intent. Things got on top of me. I tried to get help for Agnes.’ He added: ‘The worst thing that could have happened has. I have lost Spike.’","WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"An astonishing collection of letters written by future kings Edward and George reveal the princes' 'heartbreak' at not being allowed to fight in WWI. In the candid correspondence, the future King Edward VIII bemoans having to 'stay with the women' while others fought in the trenches after being banned from entering conflict as he was heir to the throne. His younger brother, the future George VI, who was held back from active service by doctors after suffering gastric problems, meanwhile feared peers would blame his renowned stammer for his staying out of the line of fire. In the astonishing collection of letters princes Edward and George bemoan having to stay at home while others fought in the trenches in WWI . In one letter written by George to Admiral Tait on October 19 1914, the royal says he agrees with his advice not to return to H.M.S. Collingwood after being injured . The letters, written between 1912 and 1932 on Bucking Palace letter-headed paper, were sent to Admiral Sir William Campbell Tait who served as the royals' mentor during the First World War. In one, written by Edward on August 5, 1914, the prince tells of his envy of servicemen on the front line. 'Oh god!! How I envy you all on active service, ready to deliver to those bloody Germans what I hope and am confident will be their death blow!! 'While you are all out, undergoing hardships and risking your lives, here am I left at home with the women, totally devoid of any job. He continues: 'It is breaking my heart, almost, this feeling of being left out of it is becoming intolerable!!!' 'However I have no right to bother you with my small troubles in such critical times as these; but we have known each other so well that I can't refrain from speaking out and giving vent to my feelings which are absolutely genuine!!'. Another letter from George describes an abscess removed from his navel 'much to his relief' In another, the prince, who was known to his family as Albert, describes keeping himself entertained while recovering from illness. He writes: 'I have plenty to do here, what with books, papers and letter writing' A letter on September 17th George writes: 'I am very glad that my operation is now over and it went off most satisfactory' A 1914 letter accompanied with a photograph of the future King Edward VIII in his grenadiers uniform is part of the collection . The collection has been lovingly restored by Admiral Tait's family who had all the letters bound in books . King Edward VIII (left) and Admiral Sir William Campbell Tait (right) at sea off the west coast of Scotland . When he was banned from undertaking active service by Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchner, Edward VIII had already joined the Grenadier Guards. But, eager to be a part of the historic war and boost soldiers' morale, he visited the front line on several occasion, taking a camera with him to document his outings. Aged 21 at the time, he visited France several times and became popular in the trenches. George, meanwhile, had intended to fight the war out. After passing out at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, he served as a midshipman on H.M.S Collingwood. To the envy of his brother, he saw the Battle of Jutland in 1916, but was withdrawn shortly afterwards with an ulcer. In 1919, he joined the RAF and was a certified pilot. On September 13, he wrote: 'I am very depressed again. It is astounding to think that I have a commission in both services (Army and Navy) and I am denied seeing active service in either. 'I can assure you I am a broken man.' Edward joined the Grenadier Guards during the war but was not allowed to seek active service as the direct heir to the throne. Throughout the Twenties he undertook foreign tours of the empire and, in the early 1930s, visited deprived areas in Britain. His shock abdication in 1936 to marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson inducted his younger brother George to the throne. Writing before either of the brothers had become king, George's letter revealed a softer, more concerned personality than his boisterous older brother. After suffering severe gastric problems, doctors ordered the royal could not undertake active service. His own letters to Admiral Tait reveal his fear of being criticised by the public for not fighting on the front line. After taking part in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, he was withdrawn from active service with an ulcer. A Christmas card sent by the future King George VI - who was known as Albert to the family - is part of the collection . King George VI (far left) pictured on board H.M.S Collingwood before he was withdrawn from active service over health problems . In one letter, he writes: 'I quite agree with what you say about my returning to the ship. 'It is no good running the risk of opening the wound as then I should have to leave the one and only service there is. 'There has been quite a fuss about my injury . 'Treves is writing a report for the papers which will stop any unpleasant remarks passed by people about what I am doing at home for so long.' A self-portrait by King Edward VIII during his time at Oxford drawn on October 29 1912 . After the war, he writes again to Admiral Tait to gush about his new bride, the Queen Mother, who he describes as 'the most wonderful little person'. He also describes his shyness and fear of public speaking - made famous in the film The King's Speech - and talks of 'breathing properly and having confidence' in oneself'. The letters have been made available by the family of Admiral Tait, and are being sold at auctioneers Martel Maides in Guernsey for an estimated £45,000. Within the correspondence also lies reference to the notorious Bullingdon Club, the exclusive drinking club for Oxford University students which David Cameron and Boris Johnson were both members of during their time studying. In one letter, Edward, who attended Magdalene College after being withdrawn from naval college, wrote: 'Everyone drank everybody else's health at least 10 times and so you can imagine how persistent it was, there being 100 of us present. 'Shouting and yelling never ceased and the amount of port consumed was astounding.' James Bridges, of Martel Maides, said: “The art of letter writing is drying up. Such a collection of letters would not exist today. 'I would be surprised if the two prices wrote letters of the length and style in the way that they used to be now. 'It was hugely exciting to have the collection in their upcoming sale. 'Letters like these are totally alien to a modern generation. Nothing like this has ever come to the market before. 'It is quite extraordinary for such a personal collection of letters to be outside the Royal Collection. They give a real flavour of the characters of the two princes. 'It is an extremely important archive two of the most significant members of the Royal Family in the 20th century.' The letters will go on sale at Martel Maides in Guernsey on October 2. As the documents reveal, both princes Edward and George vied to fight for Britain during WWI. Similarly, Princes William and Harry have both expressed their desire to serve on the front line. Much like his ancestor Edward, Prince William was kept back from the front line while serving in the RAF. In 2009 the Duke of Cambridge revealed his disappointment at not being allowed to fight, saying: 'I didn't join the forces to be mollycoddled or treated any differently. As far as I am concerned, in my eyes, if Harry can do it, then I can do it. 'As a future head of the Armed Forces it's really important you at least get the opportunity to be credible and to do the job I signed up for the best I can. 'That's all I have ever wanted.' Prince Harry however completed a four-month tour of Afghanistan in 2013. The fourth-in-line to the throne last year revealed he had killed in combat, saying: 'If there's people trying to do bad stuff to our guys, then we'll take them out of the game, I suppose'. A previous tour to the war-torn country was cancelled amid 'serious threats' to the young royal.

"With regular football matches to enjoy, a posse of cheerful sisters and a successful mother making a name for herself in the Afghan parliament, life for Mehran Rafaat, seven, is good. But though he might look like a happy little boy, Mehran is actually a girl and, like many others, has been made to live a lie in order to spare his family's blushes. And his story is by no means unique, with  family turning their girls into boys for fear of being shunned thanks to their inability to have sons and to create a useful pair of extra hands in a society where girls are kept behind closed doors at all times. Happy: Seven-year-old Mehran Rafaat is actually a girl but lives as a little boy with her family's blessing . Playing around: Mehran, pictured with her sister Behishta, 11, will become a girl again when she hits puberty . When he reaches puberty, he, like other 'bacha posh', as they are called in the Dari language, will  be returned to his original gender, although some remain in their male clothing until they marry. Now the story of Afghanistan's bacha posh has been turned into a book, The Underground Girls of Kabul, which author Jenny Nordberg  hopes will make the world sit up and take notice of their plight. 'This is a universal tale of oppression and one that resonates deeply with me,' she explained in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'The Underground Girls of Kabul and the practice of bacha posh offers a window into one of the most closed and secretive parts of Afghan society and culture.' Until recently, the very existence of Afghanistan's girl-boys was virtually unknown, a silence only broken by a newspaper article written by Nordberg in 2010. Not unusual: Mehran, pictured with her mother Azita outside the family home, is by no means unique . One of many: Like Mehran, many girls live as boys, often in a bid to maintain their family's honour . Fun: Like other bacha posh, Mehran is allowed a huge number of freedoms that other girls are not . Shortly after arriving in 2009, she was interviewing  local politician Azita Rafaat whose gaggle of daughters revealed that their youngest brother was, in fact, also a girl. 'I was astonished, and didn’t quite believe them at first,' she remembers. 'But it was true.' Intrigued, she began searching for more bacha posh and soon discovered that the phenomenon of families with sons who were actually daughters was more common than she realised. 'These girls are brought up as boys by their parents for several reasons but at the core of it is that in Afghanistan, only boys count. 'In a deeply patriarchal  society, where only men  inherit property and can support their families by working, a family without sons is seen as weak, incomplete and the parents are pitied. 'So as strange as it may seem at first, it’s a way for people to get around that  injustice, and it’s not uncommon for a family with only daughters to just dress a daughter as a boy, and present her as such to the outside world.' Different world: Mehran's mother Azita, seen here with daughter Benafsha, 11, was also a bacha posh . Play time: Mehran, who became a boy aged five, plays with a friend in an alleyway near her home . Families who do turn their girls into boys benefit from higher status and are also allowed to send their bacha posh out on errands - something that no girl is allowed to do. 'In Afghan society, a boy can roam around freely, play outside, ride a bike and hang out with other boys and adult men,' explains Nordberg. 'A girl is much more sheltered and restricted at all times. The bacha posh get to see more of the sky and what life on the side of privilege and rights is like. It can also mean a chance of going to school, in areas where it may be more difficult for girls to do so.' But while the bacha posh enjoy more freedom during their time spent as boys, the transition back to female life can prove almost unbearable. 'The bacha posh are expected by society to revert back to being girls, and young women, around the time of puberty,' explains Nordberg. 'That is when the small window of freedom closes, and a girls is put in a headscarf and a skirt, to prepare for marriage to a man of her parents’ choice.' Traumatic: Zahra, 15, from Kabul has lived as a boy since the age of two and doesn't want to be a woman . Change: Shukria lived as a boy between the ages of two and 20 but is now a married mother of three . Among those to find it impossible is Zahra, a 15-year-old who appears in the book, and who says she never wants to go back and be a woman in Afghanistan. Others, such as Shukria Siddiqui, a 36-year-old mother of three, make the transition. More still, Nordberg's friends Nader and Shahed among them, never make the switch and continue to live disguised as men. Nordberg is clearly heartbroken for them. 'I think it’s upsetting that this practice needs to exist to this day,' she says, passionately. 'To disguise yourself as a boy or a man is something that women have done throughout history when they have been denied basic human rights, such as the right to an education, or the right to choose when and if she gets pregnant. 'These girls are not so much a gender story but a symptom of an extremely dysfunctional society that inevitably has to change.'","Afghanistan is home to thousands of girls forced to live as boys .

Won’t say any details now. A week off. No comment.’ By last night, it had been retweeted 17,000 times. The tweet was followed by her saying she was ‘very busy at the moment, tweaking a screenplay and being involved in @lumos campaigns. Back when I’ve finished something.’ Lumos is her children’s charity. The screenplay she is working on is thought to be a reference to a forthcoming series of films based on her short book Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them. The British author posted a cryptic message on her page before telling followers it was 'something to ponder' She then followed up the cryptic tweet with a series of other messages before finally confirming that her message was not in fact a reference to Harry Potter but instead to her new book - Fantastic Beasts . And last night the multi-millionaire author, who is thought to be worth more than £570 million, revealed the tweet meant: ‘Newt only meant to stay in New York for a few hours’. Newt Scamander is the star of the spin-off, which is set to become a film trilogy. Set in 1920s New York, he is a magizoologist - dealing with magical creatures. Miss Rowling thanked her fans for busting the riddle, saying: ‘Thank you, thank you, for being the kind of people who get excited about an anagram.’ The seven Potter books, which made Rowling, a multimillionaire, gave rise to the hugely successful film series, eight video games and the licensing of hundreds of additional Harry Potter products. Last year rumours of a new Harry Potter book circulated after a fake press release appeared online on April 1. While thousands of Twitter users thought the clue was reference to a new Harry Potter book (left), the author finally confirmed that it was reference to a screenplay for her book Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them . Fans were hoping the cryptic message was a clue about a new sequel to the Harry Potter franchise which saw Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint star in the blockbusters based on her best-selling books . A statement on Miss Rowling’s website says in reply to the question of whether there will be another Harry Potter novel: ‘I have always refused to say ""never"" to this question, because I think it would be foolish to rule out something I might want to do in a few years’ time. 'However, I have no immediate plans to write another Harry Potter novel, and I do think that I have rounded off Harry’s story in the seven published books.’ The Harry Potter series of books has sold more than 450 million copies and the brand has an estimated worth of $15 billion. Miss Rowling has also published a novel for adults, The Casual Vacancy, and two detective thrillers under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.","JK Rowling has sent fans into frenzy by posting cryptic message on Twitter .

"Ford is preparing to roll out a car seat that can check a driver's heart activity. The seat uses six embedded sensors to detect electrical impulses and can detect if someone is having a heart attack through clothing. If higher than usual heart activity is detected, the necessary authorities can be contacted to provide assistance to the driver. Scroll down for video . Ford's European Research and Innovation Centre in Aachen, Germany is working on a car seat that can detect heart attacks (shown). The device uses six embedded sensors to monitor heart activity. It can then work out through clothing if someone is having a heart attack . The project is being undertaken by Ford's European Research and Innovation Centre in Aachen, Germany and Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen University. The sensors sit on the back of the seat with the electrodes designed to detect the electronic signature of the heart through clothing. Used in medicine for more than a century, the Electrocardiograph (ECG) is a method for monitoring the activity of the heart through sensors that detect its electrical impulses. These impulses are then displayed in the form of a graph, originally on paper but more recently on monitors and computer screens. Traditionally, ECGs have required metal sensors to be attached directly to the subject's skin at various locations on the body. The system measures voltage from the heart's 'depolarisation' action at these different locations. The difference between the readings provides the information experts require to monitor heart activity. The Ford heart rate monitoring seat performs much like a traditional ECG, except the sensors are placed on the surface of the car seat instead of being directly attached to the driver. These special sensors are capable of reading the heart’s electrical impulses through clothing and are able to use the driver's natural contact with the seat to maintain a reading in most cases. The Ford heart rate monitoring seat performs much like a traditional ECG, except the sensors are placed on the surface of the car seat instead of being directly attached to the driver. These special sensors are capable of reading the heart's electrical impulses through clothing and are able to use the driver's natural contact with the seat to maintain a reading in most cases. Ford's engineers are apparently working on making sure all materials, body shapes and sizes can be catered to by the electrodes. Research has shown that drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease are 23 per cent more likely to be involved in a road accident, rising to 52 per cent for drivers suffering from angina - chest pains caused by the heart. Fords car seat may in some cases detect increased heart activity before the driver notices they are having a heart attack, so the system would display a message to the driver telling them to pull over. Response teams could also be informed of the heart condition of the driver before, during and after an incident. Existing Ford systems such as Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keeping Aid, Active City Stop, Driver Alert and Speed Limiter could potentially be activated when the Ford heart rate monitoring seat senses an attack is imminent, mitigating the consequences of a driver losing control because of a heart-related episode. The sensors sit on the back of the seat with the electrodes designed to detect the electronic signature of the heart through clothing. The system will notify the necessary authorities in an emergency. There's no firm roll-out date yet but it should be available by 2020, a Ford spokesperson tells MailOnline .

According to the US Census Bureau, the number of Americans aged 65 and older is expected to double to 88.5 million by 2050, outnumbering children under five for the first time. 'With increasing life expectancy meaning higher numbers of people and therefore drivers at risk of heart diseases, the ability to monitor hearts at the wheel would offer massive benefits in terms of health and road safety, both for the user and the wider public,' said RWTH Aachen University Professor Steffen Leonhardt in a statement.","Ford's European Research and Innovation Centre in Aachen, Germany is working on a car seat that can detect heart attacks .

"Rivaling all things Ebola-related for the title of most tasteless Halloween costume this year is an outbreak of ill-advised Ray Rice-themed ensembles – a shocking number of which feature the wearers proudly posing in blackface. Ex-Ravens running back Rice, 27, was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after unseen footage surfaced of him knocking his then fiancée unconscious during an argument in an Atlantic City elevator in February. After dominating the national media for several days in September, the incident has now inspired a rash of ill-advised Halloween costumes. Good role models? A son posted this photo on Instagram of his parents happily posing in blackface as Ray and Janay Rice . Someone's son: A young boy poses for photos in blackface and dragging a doll as he reenacts the incident which lead to Ray Rice's indefinite suspension . Not content with blackface, this man also sports an Afro wig and his daughter comments '#mydadsbetterthanyours' The first photos of such a costume emerged last week via Reddit and showed an unidentified male wearing Rice’s #27 jersey and holding a black blowup doll by the hair in reference to the brutal incident. 'Ladies were falling for my friends Ray Rice costume,' wrote Redditor AL0311. While commenters in the Reddit forum were largely accepting of the costume, it prompted a hail of criticism elsewhere and was described as 'sick,' 'despicable' and 'contemptuous.' Rice’s wife Janay tweeted her dismay at the costume on Wednesday. 'It’s sad, that my suffering amuses others,' she tweeted. As if dressing up to glorify an act of domestic abuse wasn’t tasteless enough, other photos have emerged since showing like-minded costume-wearers ‘inspired’ by Rice – a shocking number of whom couldn't resist the urge to take the sick stunt to another level and parade around in blackface. A mom proudly poses with her son in her costume as 'Ray Rice's battered wife' A man wearing blackface drags an inflatable doll that is supposed to represent Janay Rice . The shocking selection of photos have prompted highly critical comments from people disgusted at that in 2014 there are people who think that domestic abuse and blackface are funny . One photo showing a couple dressed as Ray and Janay Rice was shared by ESPN commentator Keith Olbermann with his half a million followers. The couple's son's, who took the offending photo, has since deleted his Instagram account. Other photos to have emerged show one person sporting an Afro wig along with their blackface attire. The daughter of the man in the photo comments '#mydadsbetterthanyours', while she has received a number of critical remarks from people appalled by the man's behavior. Another photo shows a young child posing with a plastic doll representing Janay Rice. One mother has even posted a photo showing her as Janay Rice with a black eye and is tagged with #domesticviolenceisnotfunny #butmycostumewas. The shocking selection of photos have prompted highly critical comments from people disgusted at that in 2014 there are people who think that domestic abuse and blackface are funny. Rice was suspended for two games from the NFL after the incident; after full video of the assault leaked, however, he was suspended indefinitely and cut by the Baltimore Ravens. The couple married shortly after the incident and Janay has spoken publicly in support of her husband. Ray Rice is currently in the process of appealing his indefinite suspension.

"The Federal Aviation Administration is ordering airlines to replace cockpit displays on more than 1,300 Boeing 737- and 777-model airplanes costing nearly $14 million because of concerns regarding Wi-Fi interference, according to an FAA document published in the Federal Register today. The document, an Airworthiness Directive, makes the action mandatory  for any airlines that haven't completed the action, which Boeing recommended to airlines in November 2012. Boeing works closely with the FAA to ensure safety and the directive is a regulatory step in making already-in-place actions mandatory. The FAA is giving the airlines five years to comply to the directive by replacing certain Phase 3 display units made by Honeywell International Inc. The FAA document stated that the display units were tested and failed to tolerate below-average radio frequency emissions due to Wi-Fi frequency bands. Reuters reports that Independent studies conducted by the FAA and Boeing both showed blanking on display unit screens when Wi-Fi-capable devices were used near them. Plans: Just two weeks before the Federal Aviation Administration's order, Ray Conner, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, planned to boost production of the Boeing 737 model to 52 per month. The FAA reports that the display units' susceptibilities are not limited to Wi-Fi transmissions and include mobile satellite communications, cell phones, air surveillance and weather radar, and other systems. The document stated that the FAA's order is to 'prevent loss of flight-critical information displayed to the flight during a critical phase of flight crew, such as an approach or takeoff, which could result in loss of airplane control, at an altitude insufficient for recovery, or controlled flight into terrain.' Fail: The display units in 737-and 777-model Boeing airplanes were tested and failed to tolerate below-average radio frequency emissions due to Wi-Fi frequency bands. The FAA's order will be effective in 35 days, forcing airlines to replace the display units in 1,149 737-model airplanes and 177 of the 777-model airplanes -- totaling 1,326 airplanes. Each display unit replacement on each airplane will cost more than $10,000 with labor for one of each plane totaling $425, according to the FAA document. This means that, in total, the entire project will cost nearly $14 million. Millions: Each display unit replacement on each airplane will cost more than $10,000 with labor for one of each plane totaling $425 -- the entire project will cost nearly $14 million. USA Today reports that the FAA's order comes at a time when gadgets and Wi-Fi-capable devices are increasingly becoming permitted on airplanes. Manufacturers have reportedly agreed that the devices wouldn't interfere with cockpit navigation and communications equipment. USA also reported that Southwest Airlines reported that more than 400 of its planes have flown nearly 2.4 million hours without display unit malfunctions. However, the FAA said that operator reports and the independent study have determined that the display units are a safety issue.","The Federal Aviation Administration is ordering display unit replacements on Boeing 737 and 777 airplanes .

"Napoleon the Great by by Andrew Roberts (Allen Lane, £30) As there are already ‘many tens of thousands’ of books on Napoleon, and 33,000 extant letters and memoranda by him to consult in the Paris archives, Andrew Roberts will have to concede that the trajectory of his subject’s life and career, from Corsican upbringing to meeting his Waterloo at, er, Waterloo, is pretty well known. Never before, however, has the scope and sweep been encapsulated so cogently in a single volume — even if it is a veritably Napoleonic volume of 1,000 pages, needing its own lectern. Roberts has a superb eye for detail and useless facts. Napoleon Brandy, for example, is ill-named, as the Emperor never drank spirits. On the other hand, he took 800,000 pints of red wine with him to Egypt. Though Napoleon is credited with inventing the Legion d’Honneur, not many people know he set up the French Fire Brigade — the sapeurs-pompiers — or that he introduced street lighting in Malta. Scroll down for video . Napoleon Brandy is ill-named, as the Emperor never drank spirits, on the other hand, he took 800,000 pints of red wine with him to Egypt . At the height of his power, Napoleon owned 39 palaces, some he never once visited. He was considered a monstrous figure in Britain — Boney as a bogey-man — yet Keats had a snuffbox with his portrait on it, Byron built a replica of his coach, and Lord Melbourne, the Prime Minister, wrote odes about him. Napoleon’s cure for piles was to apply leeches to his bottom. He was clearly a brave man. ‘I am the Revolution!’ Napoleon had exclaimed, and Roberts’s book backs up the boast. After his first few military victories, ‘I no longer regarded myself as a simple general,’ the character whom his troops affectionately called ‘the little corporal’ stated, ‘but as a man called upon to decide the fate of peoples.’ Napoleon was a veritable force of destiny — his megalomania was a foretaste of Hitler’s. Roberts, however, is at pains to make us appreciate Napoleon’s more humane achievements. He abolished the Inquisition and anti-Semitic regulations; he got rid of feudal practices and restraints on trade imposed by guilds, for example. Insisting on ‘equality before the law’ in civil and criminal actions, Napoleon drew up legislation to protect citizens from arbitrary arrest. He protected property rights and codified inheritance decrees. He gave better pay, conditions and pensions to soldiers. He instituted an educational system based on merit, not the privileges of birth. Napoleon was a veritable force of destiny — his megalomania was a foretaste of Hitler’s . All well and good — but for Napoleon, warfare was his preferred element, not a legislative chamber or committee room. He was never more down in the dumps than when he told Josephine: ‘My enemies are defeated, thrashed, in full rout.’ He didn’t much like Paris, a place ‘he had come to equate with corruption, disloyalty, heartache, secret malice and the potential for deep embarrassment’. How much more wholesome, manly, psychologically cleaner and fresher, by contrast, was a battlefield, with its displays of sheer courage and strategic ingenuity. As a military cadet, where he’d excelled in maths and ballistics, Napoleon learned the arts of musketry, drills and horsemanship. He early in life formed ‘a strong belief’ in the virtues of brute force. ‘One cannot remain three minutes without gunpowder,’ was his philosophy, and his tutors thought him ‘blunt in manners, bold, enterprising and even ferocious’. His first major action was at Toulon, where by ‘hectoring, bluster, requisitioning and political string-pulling’ he pounded the British fleet with cannon and mortars. Napoleon was a brigadier-general by the age of 24. He went on to fight more than 60 pitched battles, Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, Borodino among them, and blow me down with a feather if Andrew Roberts doesn’t give an account of every single one, with maps, diagrams and in prose of much wit and total clarity. So what if 18,000 men lost their lives in a campaign? Napoleon could rely on 50,000 fresh conscripts each year. He understood ‘the psychology of the average soldier’ — their need for songs, mottoes, medals, ‘small things that helped breed devotion’ and ensured the esprit de corps. Much of the army’s time was spent fighting and re-fighting the Austrians, Prussians and Russians. Napoleon was an expert at playing allies off against each other, drawing up treaties that would then be breached and give him further excuses for war. Continuous conflict ensured there was a steady stream of pictures, statues and furniture from conquered cities making its way to Paris — loot for the Louvre. Napoleon invaded Egypt to annexe the Ottoman Empire and ‘damage British trade in the region’. For Napoleon, warfare was his preferred element, not a legislative chamber or committee room . He went to Spain to steal their ships, with which he’d planned to invade England — as with Hitler, a long-gestated and unfulfilled dream. ‘Good and upstanding people must be persuaded by gentle means,’ he murmured. ‘The rabble must be moved by terror.’ As dictators throughout history always realise, terror tactics work best. ‘Bloodletting is among the ingredients of political medicine,’ he believed. He used grapeshot on civilians and ordered massacres and village burnings. It was Napoleon’s policy to execute influential inhabitants, ‘at least one of whom must be a lawyer’. Well, most of us will be with him there. At one town he took in the Middle East, even he was a little taken aback, however, at ‘the sound of shots, shrieking of women and fathers, piles of bodies, a daughter being raped on the cadaver of her mother, the smell of blood, the groans of the wounded’. Yet how else really, he reasoned, could you ‘secure tranquillity’? Poetic justice of a kind came about in Jaffa. The French caught the plague from the locals. Soldiers were ‘covered with foam and the disgusting evacuations of abscessed buboes’. At Borodino, 60,000 cannonballs were fired. There were 43,000 immediate casualties and 140,000 further deaths from wounds and disease, statistics that would remain a record until World War I . The march on Moscow and the subsequent retreat in sub-zero temperatures is another horrific episode, ‘reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch’s depiction of Hades’, to which Roberts gives the full Tolstoyan treatment. At Borodino, 60,000 cannonballs were fired. There were 43,000 immediate casualties and 140,000 further deaths from wounds and disease, statistics that would remain a record until World War I. To put this in perspective, Roberts says it was like a Jumbo jet crashing with no survivors every five minutes for ten hours solid into an area six miles square. A quarter of a million horses were taken on the Russian adventure, 10,000 expiring in the very first week from a combination of dehydration and a diet of wet grass. Napoleon himself went through five mounts a week, exhausting them ‘in quick succession’ as he ‘bowled unstoppably along a narrow valley gorge’. No wonder he had piles. It was clear to anyone that Napoleon was driven by an ambition ‘full of zeal and fire’ and that one day he’d run the whole show in France if not Europe and the whole world . It was clear to anyone that Napoleon was driven by an ambition ‘full of zeal and fire’ and that one day he’d run the whole show in France if not Europe and the whole world. Having been elected First Consul in 1799, he soon became First Consul for Life and then Emperor. His costume at his coronation included a gold laurel-wreath that evoked Ancient Rome. Like the guillotined Louis XVI, he took up residence in the Tuileries and went in for flunkeys, grandeur and elaborate display. His wife Josephine’s dress bills were bigger than Marie Antoinette’s. Napoleon was not such a tactical genius with his lady friends. His first paramour was the 16-year-old Desirée, daughter of ‘a dead royalist textile and soap millionaire’. Her rejection of him ‘contributed to his deep cynicism about women and even about love itself’. Josephine, or the Vicomtesse Marie-Joseph-Rose Tascher de la Pagerie for short, had blackened stubs for teeth, the result of chewing raw sugar in Martinique as a child. Her detractors called her ‘a cajoling courtesan’, and Napoleon thought her ‘frivolous, capricious and giddy’, so he married her in 1796. It was not the great romance of legend. Napoleon didn’t seem to mind that she took lovers, one immediately after their marriage. He was seldom at their home in Paris, preferring to invade Russia than the bedchamber. After the defeat by Wellington at Waterloo, in 1815, Napoleon wanted to settle in the U.S., where he’d no doubt have started up again. Instead, he was banished 4,400 miles away to the humid island of St Helena, where it was so damp his playing cards stuck together unless kept in the oven — one of the typical small details that makes Roberts’s book an epic joy.","Napoleon Brandy is ill-named, as the Emperor never drank spirits .

"Australians have one of the best vantage points in the world to watch the stunning ‘blood moon’ lunar eclipse on Wednesday, with astrophysicists promising it will be even more spectacular than last time. On April 15, armchair astronomers watched the first of four total lunar eclipses, part of a four-stage event, known as a 'Tetrad', that is also believed to mark the beginning of significant events – even the end of the world - in some religions. The awe-inspiring spectacle occurs when the Earth's shadow passes over the moon - and on Wednesday the second eclipse will happen higher up in the sky promising a more dazzling sight. ‘This time it’s going to start higher in the sky, on April 15 the moon was low down close to the horizon but this time it will start about a third of the way up from the horizon so when it‘s red we will see it much higher and brighter in the sky,’ astrophysicist Dr Stephen Hughes told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . A red moon will be visible in Australia and other parts of the world on Wednesday . The senior lecturer at Queensland University of Technology explained: ‘A blood Moon occurs when the orbit of the Moon is nearly perfectly aligned with the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. ‘The simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises on the rim of the Earth, make the Moon red.’ With a small pair of binoculars people will also be able to spot Uranus about ‘two moon widths away’ from the the blood moon. Dr Hughes advised to look out for a ‘bluey green dot’. Weather permitting, Australia, New Zealand, North America and South America will all have great views of the blood moon, while Europe, Africa and the Middle East will miss out. In this photo people watch as the 'Blood Moon' rises over the water in Williamstown, Melbourne, on April 15 . A blood moon occurs when the moon passes in to the shadow of Earth called the umbra . It is described as the 'simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises' In Australia, Dr Hughes said that ‘anywhere down the East Coast’ is the best place to view it, while people probably won’t be able to see the whole of it in Western Australia. ‘They might just see the end of it,’ he said. In Australia the lunar eclipse will occur on Wednesday night at the following times: . NSW, ACT, Victoria, Tasmania: Eclipse begins 8:15PM. Totality begins 9:25PM. Totality ends 10:25PM. Eclipse ends 11:35PM. Queensland: Eclipse begins 7:15PM. Totality begins 8:25PM. Totality ends 9:25PM. Eclipse ends 10:35PM. South Australia: Eclipse begins 7:45PM. Totality begins 8:55PM. Totality ends 9:55PM. Eclipse ends 11:05PM. Northern Territory: Eclipse begins 6:45PM. Totality begins 7:55PM. Totality ends 8:55PM. Eclipse ends 10:05PM. Western Australia: Eclipse begins 6:19PM (moonrise). Totality begins 6:25PM. Totality ends 7:25PM. Eclipse ends 8:35PM. The eclipse will happen two more times over the next two years as part of this cycle, on April 4 and September 28, 2015. The next Tetrad cycle won't occur until 2032. ‘If we were on the moon during this eclipse, we would see a bright orange-red ring in the sky where the Earth should be. The light from that bright ring bathes the moon in a reddish glow, which we can see from Earth.’ Dr Hughes explained. Some Christians are concerned that the celestial event could mark the start of terrible events, based on a passage from the Bible that says: 'The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes.' In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition. The second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded and the most recent one - in 1967 - happened during the Six-Day War between Arabs and Israelis. John Hagee, a Christian pastor who has written a book on the Tetrad called 'Four Blood Moons: Something is About to Change' told the Daily Express that the first of the blood moons in 2014 took place right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover. Dr Hughes said that 'anywhere down the East Coast' is the best place to view it . The second, on October 8, occurs during the Feast of the Tabernacle and the third will be on April 4, 2015, also during Passover. The final one happens on September 28, 2015, which is also during the Feast of the Tabernacles. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon. This gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks. At the eclipse's peak, the moon enters the Earth's full shadow; the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sun's red visible light; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. As a result, the red light reflects off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it.","A 'blood moon' occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth .

"A Buddhist monk remains in an induced coma while a temple caretaker is recovering after a nail gun attack between the pair at a Sydney temple. The 29-year-old monk and 59-year-old Buddhist leader have been identified as Karuna Kim and Tha Lam. The pair were found with injuries to the head at a Cambodian Buddhist temple in Rossmore, in Sydney's south west, about 3.30pm on Wednesday. Mr Lam - who is the president of the Vat Ketanak Khmer Kampuchea Krom - is now out of his coma and told a member of his congregation he heard a 'bang, bang' before he was shot, 9News reported. Scroll down for video . The two men involved a nail gun attack in the outer suburbs of Sydney have been identified as 59-year-old Tha Lam (left) and 29-year-old Karuna Kim (right) Two men have been shot in the head with a nail gun following an attack at a Buddhist temple in Sydney's south-west . Monk Karuna Kim - who was the alleged shooter - is still in an induced coma at Liverpool Hospital's intensive care unit. It has been reported both men had surgery for their injuries and Mr Kim had a 10cm nail in his head. Temple caretaker Tha Lam's condition has improved and remains stable. Member Vannara Kim told the broadcaster that Mr Lam was most likely doing paperwork when Karuma fired off the shot that lodged a nail behind the temple president's right ear. 'He [Mr Lam] said to me, first of all he heard 'bang bang' like the nail gun,' he said after visiting the leader at the hospital. 'After that the monk grabbed his head and shoot him. That's what he tell me and that's what I heard from the man.' Translators are assisting police in interviewing witness to the shocking incident . The temple is located on Wynyard Avenue in Rossmore - which is in a usually quiet rural area of Sydney . A 29-year-old monk remains in an induced comas following the dispute . Vannara said he was close friends with both men who were 'very good and respectable people' and Mr Lam was talking 'like normal'. 'Sometimes this world is not very perfect 100 percent, we are very, very sad about this one.' Police believe one man shot the other in the head with the nail gun and then shot himself but authorities don't know who was holding the weapon. It is believed the weapon used was a Paslode nail gun, commonly used by tradesmen, according to the Daily Telegraph. Police said the pair were the only two in the cottage being constructed on the property when the nail gun was fired. 'It's an unusual event,' Green Valley Superintendent James Johnson told AAP. 'We still have not been able to work out the full circumstances of what happened. 'It's very early days and we're having difficulty with the language barrier. Earlier Mr Johnson told reporters that officers found one man with 'a nail protruding from his head' when they arrived at the Wynyard Avenue scene. 'He was being treated by local residents at the centre. [Police] then found a second man inside a residence... with a wound to his head,' he said.'The 59-year-old has had the nail removed and is in a critical condition. ' 'The 29-year-old... the nail remains in his head.' Police, who initially had trouble finding out the circumstances due to language barriers, believed the pair got into a fight. 'One of those persons used a nail gun to shoot another person and it would appear shot himself,' he said. Det Supt Johnson said the men had 'official duties with the temple and religious beliefs'. Detective Superintendent James Johnson spoke to media on Thursday morning about the incident . Both men were taken to Liverpool Hospital following the incident on Wednesday about 3.30pm . Construction work is being done at the temple but police say neither of the men were builders. The place of worship is located on a 10-acre property that also has residential areas. Det Supt Johnson said it was unusual for something like this incident to happen out at the complex. 'Never had issues out there before,' he said. 'Rossmore is a rural area and it is a very quiet area…especially [out at] the temple.' Monks and staff at the temple were receiving counselling as were police officers who attended the scene. The nail gun has been recovered and police are continuing to investigate.","Monk, Karuna Kim, 29, remains in a critical condition at Liverpool Hospital after being shot in the head with a nail gun .

"It's fabulously cheap swimwear. The only downside? They might go see through. Some K-Mart pink and white striped cossies which 'may go transparent' in the water were today named among the 'winners' of the awards no company wants to receive. Consumer group Choice's 'Shonky Awards' listed the swimmers alongside some of this year's most egregious product fails. And for the wronged fans of Thermomix, a popular kitchen appliance, it was the moment they finally extracted their revenge. These K-Mart bathers may appear to cheap and stylish, however... ... The tag says 'some garments may be transparent when wet' and should 'avoid excessive contact with suntan lotions, oils, rough surfaces, heated pools and spas treated with harsh chemicals' Manufacturers of the mixer - which has an almost cult-like following - came under attack in September after they released an expensive new model without giving their loyal customers any warning. Many customers who had recently purchased the old TM31 model told Daily Mail Australia they felt tricked by the surprise release of the first mixer in seven years. Georgina Shelley from Brisbane started a petition on Change.org, writing: 'Many like myself, asked the question before purchasing, if there was a new Thermomix on the way. 'My consultant told me that she hadn't heard anything about it.' Thermomix today received a Shonky award after Choice was deluged with more than 530 nominations. Controversy: A new model Thermomix costs more than a week's holiday in Bali and many fans were upset when the manufacturer sprung an expensive new model on them . To make things sweeter for the so-called 'Thermo Fans', Choice has referred the company to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Even one of Australia's favourite brands, Arnott's, found itself a recipient of a Shonky. Earlier this year, the company released a new line of Tim Tams with a distinct peanut butter flavour. It was a mouthwatering prospect for many fans. But the consumer group today revealed that while there was one unusual ingredient included - paprika, a condiment - there were no peanuts. Missing something? Arnotts won themselves a Shonky award by failing to include an important ingredient - peanuts - in their peanut butter flavoured Tim Tams . That wasn't the only way consumers had been wronged. Choice also said consumers had been fobbed off, given Arnotts kept the same packaging but removed two biscuits from their usual serving. The Commonwealth Bank, BankWest, S-26 Gold Toddler and Junior and Amazon were also among the recipients. In a statement, CHOICE CEO Alan Kirkland said he hoped the Shonky awards would force businesses to clean up their act. 'The risk of receiving an infamous Shonky encourages businesses to sharpen up their act and put consumers first,' he said.","Consumer group dishes out its annual 'Shonky Awards'

"The DVLA’s new car tax regime descended into chaos on its first day as both its website and telephone line crashed. Paper tax discs were scrapped after 93 years yesterday in favour of an online system, causing the payment website to buckle under the weight of inquiries. It is thought that tens of thousands of people mistakenly believed they could no longer pay the tax at their local post office and tried to use the DVLA’s website instead, leading to a surge in users. Scroll down for video . Drivers have faced issues with the new vehicle tax system overnight as DVLA scraps paper road tax discs . The DVLA posted on Twitter that it was experiencing 'unprecedented demand' as drivers rushed to renew . The website and its associated phone line became so swamped that they ground to a halt. Both were also out of service for 12 hours from Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning for maintenance, which added to the problems. Some 3.8million vehicles were due to have their tax renewed at the beginning of October. A DVLA source confirmed that its system was overwhelmed, adding: ‘We have seen the highest single day online volumes as more people continue to move to our online service and away from the post office.’ The organisation issued a string of apologies on its official Twitter feed, posting on Tuesday evening: ‘If you are using our online car tax service tonight please keep trying. Unprecedented demand is causing slow responses – sorry about that.’ But many angry drivers also took to social media to vent their frustration. Some complained that it took up to four hours to complete a process that should take a matter of minutes, while others said they simply could not pay their tax at all and were worried about being fined. Another DVLA tweet advised drivers to ring its customer service line, which costs up to 40p a minute from a mobile phone. But on calling, many people were simply faced with a recorded message telling them to ring back later due to the high volume of inquiries. In a report to the Commons transport select committee earlier this year, the AA warned that the DVLA’s computer systems may not be capable of handling the new regime. Yesterday AA president Edmund King said: ‘It’s a bit ironic in this digital age that the site goes down on the first day of the electronic system coming into being. ‘I think that not only a lot of people have tried to get on to the site to renew their car tax, but also a number have tried to access the site to find out how the changes to the car tax system affect them.’ Now paper discs have been scrapped, police and traffic wardens will use cameras or handheld computers linked to the DVLA’s database, and be automatically alerted if an untaxed car is on the road. The Government claims the new system will be more efficient and cheaper to run. However, critics have suggested that without the need to display a disc, the number of motorists failing to pay their car tax could soar as high as the number who drive without insurance. The payment website and phone line were up and running again by 5pm yesterday. Last night, the DVLA apologised for the problems and suggested its telecoms provider, Vodafone, may have been responsible. A DVLA spokesman said: ‘Vodafone’s engineers worked hard with us to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. ‘Vodafone will continue to monitor the service closely and will be carrying out a full investigation.’ The screen that several motorists have faced when trying to apply for new road tax since DVLA system failed . Vehicle tax was introduced in the 1888 budget. The Roads Act 1920 required councils to 'register all new vehicles and to allocate a separate number to each vehicle' and 'make provision for the collection and application of the excise duties on mechanically propelled vehicles and on carriages'. And so the requirement to display a tax disc was introduced in 1921. More than 1.7billion tax discs have been issued since then and if they were put in a line, they would go around the world three times. Last year, the DVLA issued 42.2million tax discs weighing more than 72 tonnes. From October 1, 2014 motorists were no longer required to display the paper disc in the windows and a new digital system relying on road traffic cameras was introduced. Motorists will still have to pay tax on their vehicles, but will no longer have to display a disc in their windscreen . The paper discs were in use for 93 years but have been scrapped in a scheme set to save £20million a year .","Drivers told to scrap paper tax discs, which have been in use for century .

"A student has privately prosecuted the man who harassed him after filming evidence of the abuse on a video camera hidden inside a pair of sunglasses. Haresh Mehta, who lives in Southampton, bought the surveillance glasses in a bid to document the abuse he was suffering at the hands of his tormentor. The 20-year-old student says he complained repeatedly to the police about insults and intimidation he suffered from the man. Haresh Mehta, 20, from Southampton, mounted a private prosecution against his tormentor by using footage which he obtained through his surveillance sunglasses (file pic of Google Glass) He claims he called officers over the incident five to ten times but no action was taken. So Mr Mehta, a student at Southampton University, decided to take matters into his own hands. He bought a pair of sunglasses - similar to Google Glasses - which contain a covert video recorder in the frame. He then went about collating evidence which could be used against the man in court. Once he had evidence of the man swearing at him on camera, Mr Mehta brought his own charge against the man under the Public Order Act 1986. The landmark case - believed to be one of the first of its kind - may lead to more private prosecutions of this kind. The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at Southampton Magistrates' Court. Mr Mehta alleged the defendant's conduct involved 'threatening, abusive and insulting words or behaviour' which caused him 'harassment, alarm or distress'. As the defendant pleaded guilty, the way in which the video evidence was obtained was never scrutinised. He spent one day in prison, after being given the option by magistrates of paying a £500 fine or spending the day in custody. Mr Mehta told The Guardian: 'It was like having a camera between your eyes.' After Mr Mehta contacted a lawyer for advice, a lawyer for the defendant wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service asking it to take over the case, according to the paper. The defendant pleaded guilty at Southampton Magistrates' Court (pictured) to the harassment offence . The CPS wrote back saying there was a realistic prospect of conviction but decided not to intervene. It said it was satisfied that both sides were represented and there was no need for an independent prosecutor. Gareth Jones, a solicitor with the London law firm Rustem Guardian, who gave Mehta advice about the case, told the paper: 'This is very rare. This is the first time we have done a case like this. 'If it was the CPS themselves doing it, it might have cost them a lot of time on a not very serious case.' A CPS spokesperson said: 'We decided that there was no need for the CPS to take over this prosecution and therefore the private prosecution should be left to continue.' Earlier this year, Google Glass went on sale in the UK, costing around £1,000. Similar to a pair of spectacles, the hands-free device is equipped with an optical display which shows digital information and allows users to access apps using voice commands and movement. MailOnline has contacted Hampshire Constabulary for comment. The right to bring a private prosecution dates back to the earliest days of the legal system. Under UK law, anyone has the right to bring a private prosecution in front of the criminal courts. Cases have historically been rare due to the high costs involved in investigating and pursuing such cases. Legal aid is not available for private prosecutions, meaning they have to be paid for by the alleged victim. There are a number of organisations that regularly prosecute cases before the courts but do so as private individuals, using the right of any individual to bring a private prosecution. One example is the RSPCA. According to CPS guidance, there is nothing wrong in allowing a private prosecution to run its course through to verdict and sentence. There is no requirement for the CPS to take over a private prosecution. The fact that a private prosecution succeeds is not an indication that the case should have been prosecuted by the CPS, it says. However, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has the power to take over private prosecutions and there will be times when the CPS will exercise this power. There has been a growing trend towards private prosecutions in the past few years, raising concerns about a divided justice system, which could only allow private companies or wealthy individuals to seek justice. The most high-profile private prosecution was by the family of Stephen Lawrence in 1996. It was made against five suspects - only three of whom made it to trial - after three years of failed police investigations. All the defendants were acquitted on the orders of the judge.","Haresh Mehta, from Southampton, complained to police about being bullied .

"Two amateur historians claim the remains of King Harold, who was shot through the eye at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, lie under an ancient parish church. Cousins Terry Muff and Kevin McKenzie, who claim to be distantly related to the last Saxon king, have spent years researching the mystery of his fate after his death. They are convinced his body was carried to Bishops Stortford, in Hertforshire, by his grieving lover Edith the Fair and buried at St. Michaels' Church. Two amateur historians claim the remains of King Harold, who was shot through the eye at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, lie under an ancient parish church. Pictured is the scene depicted on the Bayeux tapestry . They say there are four surviving, intact Norman stone coffins which have not even been seen since the 19th century in a vault under the church. The pair are now calling on the vicar to open the vault and say they also expect to find the bones of his partner Edith the Fair and his two brothers. Mr Muff, a retired police detective, said: 'King Harold II, his long-term wife and lover Edith the Fair and his two brothers, Leofwine and Gyrth, all, in fact, lie in a long forgotten vault at St Michael's Church. 'There are four surviving, intact Norman stone coffins which have not even been seen since the 19th century. 'It is our firm belief that, once an archaeological investigation is undertaken, at the very least, we will find King Harold's wife, Edith the Fair, who was venerated as a medieval saint, and very probably also King Harold and his two brothers.' The amateur historians believe Harold II was buried at St Michaels' Church (pictured). 'It is our firm belief that, once an archaeological investigation is undertaken, at the very least, we will find King Harold's wife, Edith the Fair,' they said . Cousins Terry Muff and Kevin McKenzie, who claim to be distantly related to the last Saxon king, have spent years researching the mystery of his fate after his death. Pictured is a drawing by Daniel Maclise depicting the coronation of Harold . Excavators will carry out a scan of the grounds of Waltham Abbey Church in Essex (pictured) where the majority of researchers believe King Harold is buried . Shot through the eye by an arrow, he died at the hands of four Norman knights brutally dismembering his body - or so almost 950 years of history dictates. But archaeologists are now claiming King Harold may have survived the Battle of Hastings, and lived out his years before quietly dying of old age. The alternative version of events, put forward in a 12th century document housed in the British Museum, discounts the Normans' portrayal of his death in the Bayeux Tapestry. The artwork, long considered an accurate depiction of the 1066 Battle of Hastings, shows King Harold clutching at an arrow in his eye as four Norman knights hack at his body. But now a team of historians, who discovered the remains of Richard III in a municipal car park in Leicester in 2012, are eager to dispel the long-accepted story. Oval Film and Stratascan, whose efforts were applauded around the world for the discovery, will carry out an underground scan of Abbey Gardens at Waltham Abbey Church in Essex, the supposed site of King Harold's tomb, to look for his remains. The cousins are convinced King Harold's body was carried to Bishops Stortford, in Hertforshire, by his grieving lover Edith the Fair and buried at St. Michaels' Church . Harold (pictured) was born in the early 1020s, the son of Godwine, Earl of Wessex . Born: c.1020 . Parents: Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and Gytha of Denmark . Relation to Elizabeth II: husband of the 30th great-grandmother . House: Wessex . Ascended to the throne: January 5, 1066 . Crowned: January 6, 1066 at Westminster Abbey, aged c.43 . Married: (1) Eadgyth (Swan-neck), Daughter of Earl of Mercia (2) Ealdyth widow of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . Children: 1 or 2 sons and a number of illegitimate children . Died: October 14, 1066 at Senlac Abbey, Sussex, of wounds following the Battle of Hastings . Reigned for: 9 months, and 8 days . But the vicar of the church the Rev Derwyn Williams said he is 'unconvinced' by their claims and has refused permission for an archaeological investigation. Rev Williams said: 'I am unconvinced by Mr Muff's claims and do not judge that it would be appropriate to devote the time and energy needed to seek permission from the diocese and then execute an investigation of this speculation, given the many demands of contemporary ministry, schools work, pastoral care, worship and mission here, to which priority must be given.' Local historian Paul Ailey said: 'This really is of such historical importance that no objection whatsoever should be raised against a full archaeological survey of the vault and its four coffins, and that their contents be examined by medical experts. 'Bishop's Stortford could well find itself the centre of world attention if the remains of Harold, his brothers and mistress are found beneath St Michael's. 'Stranger things have happened - who would ever have believed that another past king of England, Richard III, would be found beneath a car park in Leicester?' The reasoning behind Mr Muff and Mr McKenzie's claims remains unclear, and MailOnline is yet to get a response the cousins. A spokesman for the Diocese of St Albans said: 'We are aware of the Vicar of St Michael's views about Mr Muff's request which quite correctly gives priority to the interests of a busy community of worshipping Christians, serving God and the people of Bishop's Stortford. 'These views would be taken into account and given due weight if there were any case lodged in the Consistory Court, which at present there is not. 'The case would be considered like any case asking for an investigation of the buried remains of any person, loved by their family in life and reverentially buried at death. 'Were a case to be brought, it would be in all likelihood considered by the diocesan chancellor, a judge.' The cousins are calling on the vicar to open the vault and say they also expect to find the bones of his partner Edith the Fair and his two brothers.

"Kelly Ecker, who was shot dead by her husband Dr. George 'Scott' Samson hours after their wedding on Saturday was so frightened when she called 911 she gave the wrong address. Ecker, 50, told the dispatcher her address was 4205 N. Creal St. instead of 4025 and when officers eventually arrived at the newlyweds unmarked Terre Haute mansion, it was 15 minutes after the Indiana nurse's first panicked call. Officers found Ecker dead in a bedroom having suffered multiple shots to her head and neck from a .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun and after using a remote camera discovered Samson, 54, dead in the basement from a self-inflicted gun shot wound. Scroll Down for Video . Tragedy: George 'Scott' Samson and Kelly Ecker married on Saturday evening and returned to Samson's Terre Haute home for their wedding party . Shock: Kelly Ecker with her friend Charlene Bloodworth (left) in her wedding dress on Saturday . Speculation from witnesses after the wedding alleged that an argument over money during the reception sparked the fatal argument, specifically about a financial pre-nuptial agreement. One wedding guest who spoke to Indystar said that Dr. Samson, who worked at Union Hospital in Terre Haute, became visibly annoyed during his wedding reception at the Ohio Building and left without his wife. Another guest said that they noticed the frosty atmosphere between the couple once they had returned to the couple's home for an after-party and saw they were not talking. The last guest who left at 1.17am, asked Ecker if she wanted to stay with her that night. Ecker said no. At 1.20am, Ecker made the first of four calls to 911 and told the dispatcher that her husband was going to kill her. The phone hung up before the dispatcher could verify her address and the address did not show up in any mapping system the police use. She phoned back three times and on the final call, gunshots were heard to ring out, at which point the phone went dead. According to Advance Indiana, the reception had been changed from the newlywed's home to the Ohio Building at the last minute and the marquee tent set up in their garden still hauntingly sits outside their home. Police said that Samson shot his wife multiple times with a 40-caliber handgun and records show that the Terre Haute doctor held a Federal Firearms License, which effectively enabled him to trade and sell weapons from his property - in a manner similar to a gun store owner. Indeed, according to Advance Indiana, police recovered a literal arsenal of weapons from the home, including assault rifles, hand guns and several hundred rounds of ammunition. 'They had just gotten married and something went terribly wrong,' said Vigo County Coroner, Dr. Susan Amos. 'He shot her and then shot himself. We are still in a second autopsy to confirm that.' Witnesses told the IndyStar that the couple had argued at the end of their reception and the final guest left anesthesiologist Samson's home at 1.17am. Frantic cries for help: Kelly Ecker phoned 911 in the early hours of Sunday morning to plead for help from her husband who she claimed was trying to kill her . Friends: Kelly Ecker poses with one of her co-workers before her wedding to George 'Scott' Samson on Saturday . Scene: George 'Scott' Samson and Ecker's 10-year-old son (left). Ecker posted the picture of Samson's home to Facebook in July commenting that she was delighted to be moving in with her son. She was found dead in his bedroom at the property. The 10-year-old was unharmed . Ecker, a nurse at Union Hospital, phoned 911 at 1.20am after witnesses said their argument about money spiraled out of control. 'The investigation has revealed that there was an verbal argument between the couple toward the end of the reception, which carried over to the after party at the couples' home,' said Vigo County Chief Deputy Sheriff Clark Cottom in an email to the IndyStar. 'Shortly after the last guest left at around 1:17 a.m., Kelly Ecker Samson called 911 reporting that her husband had threatened to kill her. 'There were a total of three very brief 911 calls, which in the first two the caller disconnected.' Cottom said that Ekcer was found in the bedroom her 10-year-old son from a previous relationship slept in, while Samson shot himself once in the head with a registered gun. Haunting: The marquee tent erected in the garden of Samson's home still stands the day after the tragic murder suicide . 'Deputies did find the female victim inside the child's bedroom deceased,' said Cottom to WISHTV. Cottom said that Ekcer's son and an elderly couple believed to be Samson's parents were inside the home at the time of the shooting, but were not harmed and escorted out by police when they arrived. 'We received information from the elderly male that the female's husband Scott Samson had retreated to the basement,' said Cottom to WISHTV. 1st CALL . Dispatch: '911 what's the address of your emergency?' Tragic notes left by friends: Kelly Ecker at a Christmas party with Brooke Llewelyn . Kelly: '4205 North Creal. Please. Dispatch: What's the address?' Kelly: '4205 North Creal.' Dispatch: 'Ok what's going on there?' Kelly: 'He's beating the s*** out of me.' Dispatch: 'Who is?' Kelly: 'My husband.' Dispatch: Who's your husband?' Kelly: 'Scott Samson. He's got guns inside. Call ends . Dispatcher then called back, but that call was answered and then hung up . 3rd CALL . Kelly: 'Help!' Dispatch: 'What's the address of your emergency?' Kelly: '4205 North Creal.' Dispatch: 'Ok 4205...' Kelly Interrupts... Kelly: 'Oh my God!' (Multiple shots are heard being fired) Call ends . Samson, 54, is a doctor at Union Hospital in Taure Haute and one witness told WISHTV that guests left the wedding party because of the argument that the newlyweds were having. 'They were having some domestic problems at the house. Within a short amount of time guests decided it would be best if they left. Shortly after the last guest left that's when things went terribly wrong,' said Cottom. When police arrived, they discovered the basement locked and so had to call out the Terre Haute Police Department Special Response Team. 'The remote camera was able to determine he was in the basement, unresponsive,' said Cottom. Friends such as Brooke Llewellyn took to Facebook to express their grief at the loss of their friend. 'Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine on this day that our time as friends would be cut so short,' wrote Brooke.

"Scathing: Steven Spielberg criticised the way some films are financed these days . Steven Spielberg has vowed he will never again edit his films to make them more politically correct. The . Oscar-winning director, 64, told the Daily Mail that he ‘deeply regrets’ changing a scene . in his 1982 movie E.T. for a 20th anniversary DVD release. The . guns of officials hunting the eponymous alien were replaced by . walkie-talkies, supposedly to make the film more suitable for family . viewing. But despite . his reservations about the changes, Spielberg said both the original and . modified versions will be released on Blu-ray to celebrate the 30th . anniversary of the film, which won four Academy Awards. ‘A lot of kids only know E.T. from the digitally-enhanced version,’ he explained. ‘So . in order not to traumatise that entire generation, I’ll probably come . out with the old version and the enhanced version, but sell both at the . same time, for the same price, so you can make your choice.’ Spielberg was speaking in Richmond, Virginia, where he is shooting the presidential biopic Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. In a scathing attack on the current state of Hollywood, Spielberg revealed there are ‘not a lot of films’  made over the past 20 years that he would watch. The director of such blockbusters as Jaws, Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Saving Private Ryan said that before starting a new project, he always revisits classic films from the golden age of cinema for inspiration instead. He cites The Seven Samurai, Lawrence Of Arabia and It's A Wonderful Life - as well as silent movies - as the films he uses for 'getting his engine started'. Timeless: Spielberg said he turns to classic films such as It's A Wonderful Life for inspiration . ‘They’re all told visually and they’re . all told with hyper-extended performance and with wonderful use of a . frame,’ he told the Sunday Times. Spielberg also criticised the way modern films are financed. He argued that producers are wrongly . more interested in backing concepts rather than directors and writers, and that . the hedge funds backing films demand the guarantee of a big actor. ‘My whole career has survived without big movie stars,’ he said. Despite his blunt assessment, Spielberg revealed he probably sees more than 100 movies a year – and never walks out, no matter how bad a film may seem.

The play about the brutality of the First World War, seen through the eyes of a horse, was based on a children’s book by Michael Morpurgo. It is still being staged to packed houses in London and New York. The film stars Jeremy Irvine, Emily Watson and Peter Mullan. War Horse is one of six films Spielberg has in production, along with a further 24 in development. The director has no plans to retire, instead hoping to direct ‘as long as I can’. While in the UK filming War Horse, Spielberg fell in love with English idiosyncrasies. He said he and his children became ‘sappy devotees’ of the X Factor, and he liked the way the crew on set called him ‘Guv’.","Leading director said there are few films from the past 20 years he would watch now .

"Security services are reportedly keeping tabs on 12 friends of terror suspect Numan Haider, the teen who was shot dead by police after allegedly stabbing two police officers. The 18-year-old from Melbourne was killed with a single shot to the head by a Victorian police officer on September 23 near the Endeavour Hills Police Station. Haider had been under investigation by authorities for at least three months before his death. Now ASIO are monitoring his associates, a close friend of the teen has told the Herald Sun. 'We're being terrorised by ASIO,' they claimed. The friend, who was not named, added: ‘We are not a threat. We’re normal people.’ Scroll down for video . Numan Haider was allegedly shot dead by police after stabbing two police officers in Melbourne . Daily Mail Australia have contacted ASIO for comment. In the months leading up to his death, police were reportedly concerned about some of Haider's recent activities and rhetoric. They had raided the family home hours before the stabbing incident, Victorian police commissioner Ken Lay told ABC 774 radio. Officers then arranged to meet Haider near Endeavour Hills Police Station in the city's south-eastern suburbs, where the incident occurred. Mr Lay said there was evidence suggesting Numan Haider had discussions with other people prior to the stabbing. 'There's some information that he was certainly talking to other people around the time,' Mr Lay said. 'It's certainly something we're pushing.' 'Having said that, there were some really worrying pieces about this young man's behaviour that we are working through.’ A friend of Haider's has claimed that ASIO are now 'terrorising' around 12 of his associates . Mr Lay denied claims that Haider was conducting a beheading after it was reported he had been carrying two knives and an Islamic State flag recently. 'There is nothing, absolutely nothing to suggest that was the intention,' he said. Police allege Haider greeted the Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on the night of his death. Seconds later, he repeatedly stabbed both officers. A coronial inquiry began on 3 October, where it was revealed police officers had arranged to talk to Haider about his recently cancelled Australian passport on the day that he died. Counsel assisting the coroner, Jessica Wilby, said Haider stabbed a Victoria Police officer in the arm and an Australian Federal Police officer in the chest and face. He was still holding the knife in his hand when he was shot dead, Wilby said. Haider was killed with a single shot to head by a childhood learning centre . Police and forensic officers seen by the scene of the fatal shooting in September . Haider reportedly previously came into contact with police when he was with a group of men outside the Dandenong Hub - a shopping arcade in Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs. They were questioned by as many as 15 police officers. George Sarkatzis, who owns Alabenlo music store at the arcade, said he had spoken to the teenager following the incident. He said about five to eight police officers surrounded the group on a Thursday afternoon. 'He wasn't like angry, he was just upset,' Mr Sarkatzis told Daily Mail Australia. 'He said: 'I don't have the freedom to express my beliefs''. 'My main concern was if you want to preach a belief in a peaceful place, don't wear army pants.' But this is not the first time Mr Sarkatzis had seen a group gather outside the Dandenong Hub. 'I've seen (people) now and again. They do come here and canvass their beliefs but I'm not sure if they were the same beliefs that he had.'

"A horsemeat snack is being launched as a healthy high protein food for fitness fanatics. The ‘A Bag of Horse’ snack is a form of biltong, which is normally made from beef, and has just 114 calories in a 50g pack. The snack is made in Belgium from Belgian horses and is being promoted as a far healthier option than a pack of crisps by the specialist retailer MuscleFood.com. After last year's horsemeat scandal, specialist sports food retailer Musclefood.com is selling 'A Bag of Horse' biltong as a high-protein snack, made in Belgium (File photo) Last year, millions of Britons were disgusted to discover that leading supermarkets and fast food outlets had been selling beefburgers that turned out to contain a high percentage of horse. People were alarmed to find they had been misled, while the discovery lifted the lid on a much wider problem of food fraud. Fancy eating a horse? Dartmoor Hill Pony Association has suggested that a viable market in pony meat (left) for human consumption is the only way to save the species. Sausages made out of pony meat are also pictured (right) Subsequently, some chefs, horse lovers and even the Princess Royal suggested eating horse should be embraced by way of promoting a market in the meat and improving animal welfare. A spokesman for the web store said: ‘Customers are being urged to reach for a bag of horse rather than a packet of crisps, due to its excellent nutritional and health benefits. Darren Beale, a director at the firm, said: ‘More and more people are eating horse as part of their balanced diet. I would even go as far as saying it is now acceptable and has lost its stigma' ‘The standard 50g packet of biltong, which is similar in texture to beef jerky, contains just 114 calories. This is less than half the calories of packet of plain crisps of the same size, 263 calories.’ The packets also contains 21g of protein, 2.85g of carbohydrates and just 2.1g of fat, which is healthier mix that the 3.05g protein, 25.75g carbohydrates and 15.9g fat found in a standard bag of crisps. Unusual dish: Dartmoor Hill Pony Association founder Charlotte Faulkner with a plate full of roast Dartmoor pony meat on her farm in Devon . The biltong is made by marinating horse steaks in black pepper, coriander and vinegar, before it is hung to air-dry in a controlled environment as part of a curing process. Darren Beale, a director at the firm, said: ‘More and more people are eating horse as part of their balanced diet. I would even go as far as saying it is now acceptable and has lost its stigma. The Princess Royal (left) appeared to give her support to eating horses in a speech to the World Horse Welfare charity last year . ‘The horse biltong is delicious. Like jerky, biltong is chewy however unlike the beef one, it is moister and has a sweeter flavour. Also because they take longer to eat as well as being high in protein, they will leave you feeling fuller for longer. ‘People are becoming far more adventurous when it comes to trying different meat. For many, as long as it is humanly and sustainably sourced they are prepared to give it a go.’ He added: ‘Far too often when people are peckish they reach for something unhealthy such as a packet of crisps or chocolate biscuits. We say they should reach for a bag of horse – it’s certainly the healthier option.’ The Princess Royal appeared to give her support to eating horses in a speech to the World Horse Welfare charity last year. She suggested owners might take better care of their horses if they believed they could sell them for meat. Just last month the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) said it believed the best way to save herds on the ancient moorland is by putting them on the menu in restaurants and homes, which would give them a value. Founder of the DHPA, Charlotte Faulkner said herders would only continue to keep the animals if there was a ‘sustainable market’ for them. In a letter proposing the idea sent to South West Equine Protection (SWEP), she said: ‘I am writing to ask whether SWEP would consider giving measured support to this understandably upsetting subject, which as pony lovers we find so hard to accept. ‘It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them.’ She said a meat trade would encourage herders to keep the young ponies for at least three years, which is the earliest they could be slaughtered for meat.","Biltong is made by marinating horse in black pepper, coriander and vinegar .

"When the sky over Yellowknife, Canada, lit up one cold March night with a spectacular Northern Lights display, Korean photographer Kwon O Chul was on hand to record the breathtaking phenomenon in real time with his camera. Chul, who describes himself as an astrophotographer, traveled to Canada's rugged Northern Territories south of the Arctic Circle in March 2013 to capture a celestial event known as an aurora substorm - a brief disturbance in the Earth's magnetosphere that causes energy to be released.

There are two types of auroras - Aurora Borealis, or ‘Northern Lights,’ and Aurora Australis, known as ‘Southern Lights.’ Auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles above the planet’s surface. The interactions between the charged particles give off light. Auroral displays appear in many colors: red, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting. The common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles. Magic in moonlight: Auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere .

"John Butler was jailed for seven years for manslaughter of his ex-partner Pauline . A businessman who appeared in a BBC reality show has been jailed for seven years for stabbing his estranged partner to death. John Butler, 62, killed his former partner Pauline with a kitchen knife at the flat she had moved into in Leeds after their relationship began to fail. Leeds Crown Court heard he left her dying on the floor after she threatened to stop him from seeing his granddaughter and then returned home to drink a beer and smoke a cigar. Butler was cleared of murder by a jury yesterday but had already admitted manslaughter. Sentencing Butler today, the judge, Mr Justice Edis, said he did not accept Butler's argument that at no point did he intend to kill, pointing to the severity of the injuries he inflicted on Ms Butler. The jury had heard how the defendant and his family appeared in a 2012 episode of The Fixer, featuring Alex Polizzi. The programme was about one of Butler's businesses - Kettley's Furniture, in Yeadon, Leeds. Butler and his partner had been together for 30 years but had drifted apart after their three sons had grown up. Pauline Butler, 61, who took her partner's name despite never marrying him, went to live in a flat while Butler remained at the family home in Rawdon, Leeds. On April 14 this year, Butler went round to the flat and after Ms Butler told him she hated him and asked him to leave, he stabbed his estranged partner in a 'sustained attack'. Scroll down for video . John Butler, 62, left, killed Pauline Butler, 61, right, to death in a violent attack during a row in which she said she would stop him from seeing their granddaughter . The court also heard how on two occasions, rows between the couple had resorted to Pauline using a knife to threaten Butler, when he had to restrain her. The judge said he sentenced on the basis that the jury must have decided that Butler had suffered a 'loss of control' at the time of the attack. He said he accepted that Ms Butler had been contemptuous in her comments to him as their relationship deteriorated and she had threatened him with a knife on three occasions. The judge said: 'People who wish to end their relationships and live alone without their former partner are entitled to do so without being killed. 'It is clear that for nearly ten years you had been living increasingly separate lives under the same roof. 'You spent many nights in the pub and in your den drinking too much. 'She was no doubt lonely and frustrated with what her life had become. 'She came to despise you as a weak father and a drunk, and said frequently that she deserved better than you. 'With a degree of cruelty she even said you were not a good father. 'This happened principally because you could not let go. The threat in relation to you granddaughter was the straw which broke the camel's back.' Forensic officers at a property in Rawdon, West Yorkshire, where 61-year-old Pauline Butler was found dead . 'It was your view that your family life really was over that led to your loss of control. 'Your granddaughter was very important to you and in your desperate state the prospect of no longer going out with her overwhelmed you. That was a serious verbal threat to something you hold very precious.' He added: 'In that state of mind you formed the intention to kill her. The evidence is not compelling because you say you cannot completely remember what happened.' He added: 'I'm unable to say exactly how the knife ended up in your hand.' 'You drove the knife deep into her left shoulder and sliced into her neck in a deliberate motion and drove it into her right shoulder. 'I reject your your explanation this was accidental as you fell. Something happened in that room which you have not told us about. 'Had you not intended she would die you would have called an ambulance. Instead you took out the knife, washed it and took the dog back to the family home. Miss Polizzi had tried to turn around the fortunes of the family's furniture store and funeral directors in Yeadon . When the family's business was featured in the show, the BBC programme said: 'Kettley's Furniture has been run by John Butler and his family for 33 years, but it just hasn't moved on in that time' 'When your son Richard saw you, you said 'I think I've killed your mother'. I think you knew she was dead when you left her flat.' Sending the disgraced boss down the cell, Justice Edis said: 'You have still not faced up squarely to what you did.' The couple's middle son, Richard, saw his father walk in with blood on his face, carrying a blood-stained orange towel . Butler stood with his head bowed as he was sentenced, sporting short dark hair and dark-rimmed glasses. He was wearing a grey suit with a light blue shirt and patterned blue tie. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Snow, of West Yorkshire Police, said Butler attacked his ex-partner 'sustained and violent attack' He said: 'John Butler has been convicted of killing of his long-term partner Pauline Butler, after she left him to embark on a new life without him . 'After more than 40 years together Pauline decided to leave John, sadly this was something he could not come to terms with. 'On the morning of April 14, John Butler visited Pauline at her new home. It was whilst there that an argument developed. 'Mr Butler then armed himself with a large knife and carried out a sustained and violent attack on Pauline, which resulted in her immediate death. 'Pauline was devoted mother and grandmother and was loved by many. His actions that day have without doubt had a profound effect on all those who knew and loved Pauline. 'John Butler will now for the rest of his life have to live with the consequences of his actions that fateful morning. 'I hope that after today's sentencing, the family of Pauline can in some way start to rebuild and move on with their lives.'","John Butler, 62, stabbed his estranged partner Pauline, 61, to death .

"Smokers will no longer be allowed to spark up in the playgrounds of one Paris park after a trial smoking ban was introduced for a year. The initiative, which is likely to now be extended to other outdoor public spaces, was introduced over the weekend as part of an official campaign cut smoking deaths in France. Smoking is already technically banned in all inside public places in France, including cafes, restaurants, stations and museums. Scroll down for video . Stay away from those kiddies! Paris has banned smoking inside the playgrounds of one of its city parks, a move which is expected to be the first step towards a more widespread ban on smoking in public . But terraces and other places outdoors are not included in the ban, because the chances of smokers harming those sitting around them are considered minuscule. Now the three playgrounds in the Parc de Montsouris, southern Paris, are off limits to smokers for the next 12 months. Paris deputy mayor Pénélope Komitès said breaches would be punished with a yet to be introduced system of formal warnings and fines. 'For now, we're focussing more on persuading people than on punishing them,' she was quoted as saying by the Daily Telegraph. After the trial, the city authorities 'will determine whether the measure should be made permanent and extended to other Paris parks,' Ms Komitès said. The decision to begin the process of banning smoking in the public parks of Paris comes after the mayor of UK capital London, a rival metropolis which competes with Paris in standards wealth, culture and opportunity, called similar proposals 'bossy and nannying'. Boris Johnson set himself at odds with a health panel he set up after it recommended thousands of acres of London parkland and landmarks including Trafalgar Square should go smoke free. 'This idea in my view, as a libertarian conservative, comes down too much on the side of bossiness and nannying,' said Mr Johnson. 'One feature of life in London is that we are a city that allows people to get on with their lives within the law provided they are not harming anyone else. 'I think smoking is a scourge and it's right to discourage it (but) I am very sceptical at the moment.' 'Bossiness and nannying': London mayor Boris Johnson, left, said he opposed bringing in a similar ban, which was first announced by Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, right, as a way of 'teaching people about cigarette addiction' Paris's outdoor smoking ban was first announced in July by Anne Hidalgo, the city's Socialist mayor, who said the move would be an experiment aimed at 'teaching people about cigarette addiction'. Perhaps mindful of the massive opposition that there will be to the move in a country where some 30 per cent of the country still smoke, Ms Hidalgo insisted that her 'experiment' would not be strictly enforced. 'We are not into banning, we are experimenting,' said Ms Hidalgo, who said parks in the unfashionable 14th arrondissement, where Parc de Montsouris is located, would act as 'guinea pigs in this experiment'. The move follows a new Socialist directive which allows bosses to ban wine in the work place – leading to accusations that the very heart of Gallic culture is under attack. Traditionally liberal Parisians are renowned the world over for sitting outside smoking and drinking as they discuss the arts and philosophy. Tobacco-related illnesses are a leading cause of death in France, with an estimated 73,000 deaths annually. Despite massive taxes on cigarette sales, health warnings, and every more stringent bans, the country still has some 16million smokers.","Smoking is already banned inside cafés, restaurants and stations in France .

"A pedestrian was shocked when police ordered him to take a Random Breath Test even though he was not driving a car - and argues he was not drunk and had not driven a car that day. A video of the incident in Sydney, where the man challenges the police officers, has gone viral, with more than half a million hits in just four days. Raffael Galardi was walking through a Lane Cove car park in the north of the city when he was stopped by police, who told him that they chose to RBT him randomly. In video footage, filmed on Galardi’s phone, the police confirm that he is not doing anything wrong but has been randomly selected to do a random breath test as he walks to Coles in broad daylight. Galardi recorded the incident as he challenged police; arguing that he not even travelled in the parked car and that police had even watched his female companion exit from the driver’s seat. Scroll down for video . Two police officers stopped a man and a woman who were walking in a Lane Cove supermarket and 'randomly chose' the man to give a breath test. The man claims he had walked into the car park and was not drunk . ‘Do you just stop people walking and ask them for a breath test?’ an infuriated Galardi can be heard demanding of the police officers. ‘A breath test? Why? But I wasn’t even driving?’ ‘I’m not drunk and I wasn’t driving.’ Galardi says he hadn't even been in the car, but had walked down to meet his companion in the car park. When he arrived, the police turned on their lights and stopped the pair. In the video, Galardi quizzes why his blood alcohol levels are being tested when he had not been behind the wheel of a vehicle, which police had allegedly seen his female companion park. The female driver of the car was incensed, asking police, 'Don't I have to be driving a car? You're meant to pull someone up!' ‘You just saw her get out of the car. I thought you might just have been perving at her,’ he told police. Police responded: ‘We saw the car was driving and we just wanted to stop and breath test it’, which prompted the bewildered young man’s witty response. ‘They saw the car driving? Oh. Well, they just want to breath test the car.’ The young man, walking to Coles during daylight with his female friend, felt targeted by the interrogation. Police responded, ‘we saw the car was driving and we just wanted to stop and breath test it’, which prompted the bewildered young man’s witty response.‘They saw the car driving? Oh. Well, they just want to breath test the car’ ‘You’ve pulled us up while we’re walking through a shopping centre. ‘You can’t just breath test pedestrians… Why are you picking on us? 'What because I’m dressed like this? Random? Well, why don’t you stop this bloke here?’ Galardi angrily continues to argue with police, who offer little response. ‘Talk to me like a normal man… You have just picked on us walking through a shopping centre. Tell me why,’ Galardi demands. One of the police officers explains that ‘we do about five breath tests a week.’ ‘Don’t you have to be in your car driving? You’re meant to pull someone up,’ his female companion, allegedly the driver of the car, asks police. Galardi maintains that he respects police officers and does not think the issue was serious. He found it humorous and is blown away by the huge response. He was never made to give a breath test, walking away from police with a parting shot. ‘When I break the law you can detain me. 'Otherwise, see you later. Go away!' Raffael Galardi filmed the incident, which he found bewildering but amusing, and it has since gone viral .","Sydney police pull over a man walking on the street for 'random breath test'

"An unlucky pensioner could be forced to tear down his £1 million home after it was struck by lightning. Since his wife Denise died two years ago, 79-year-old Tony Tubb, from Bexhill-on-Sea in Sussex, has battled cancer twice, had his home of 40 years burgled and had all his late wife's jewellery stolen. But just as things were starting to look up for Mr Tubb following his second cancer all clear, his home was struck by lightning - which blew a four-foot hole in the ceiling just above his bed. Tony Tubb, 79, (pictured) may have to tear down his home of 40 years after lightning struck and caused a fire . The lightning strike caused a fire to rip through the £1 million property before fire crews extinguished the blaze . Mr Tubb barely escaped with his life, as fire tore through his family home before three fire crews managed to extinguish the blaze. He has now been told that the house he raised his two children in could have to be torn down because of structural damage. This picture shows the four-foot hole in the roof above Mr Tubb's bedroom - luckily he was not injured . Mr Tubb is now waiting to hear if the house needs to be torn down due to structural damage caused by the fire . Even if his home can be saved, the unlucky pensioner has already lost most of his prized possessions, and will have to find £250,000 to pay the repair bill. Mr Tubb said: 'When lightning hits something it can cause enormous damage. It has been very upsetting. 'The house might have to be rebuilt - I am waiting to hear what the structural engineer says about it. 'It could be that the house itself is not safe enough to live in, in which case it would be a waste of money to start doing repairs. 'So I will leave it to the experts to establish whether or not the house is repairable.' The lightning tore the four-foot hole in the roof above his bedroom on October 6. He added: 'They say lightning doesn't strike twice, but in a sense it has hit me twice because of the burglary last year. 'Someone said to me I'd be more likely to win the lottery than be struck by lightning - what are the chances of having your house hit?'

"A benefit cheat who claimed she was a single mother-of-three to swindle £57,000 of taxpayers' cash has been jailed - after she posted pictures of her wedding day on Facebook. Wendy Cooper, 44, pocketed £57,210 in housing and council tax benefits and income support between September 2004 and October 2013. But she was caught out by the Department for Work and Pensions when investigators spotted that she had posted pictures of her wedding day on Facebook last November. Caught out: Wendy Cooper, 44, of Coventry, was foiled after investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions spotted this wedding photo on Facebook . Fraudulent: A judge told Cooper she had 'fiddled the public out of £57,000 when the National Health Service is striving to get machines to save people's lives and nurses have been having their pay held back' Wedding day: Cooper poses with her husband, Clifford Smith, and other family members in September 2004 . A court heard she married husband Clifford Smith, 53, in September 2004 but continued to pretend to the authorities that she was a struggling single mother. At the same time, Cooper had five jobs - including one at Coventry City Council - but carried on claiming free hand-outs. Yesterday she was jailed for eight months at Leamington Spa Justice Centre after she admitted 21 charges of failing to notify the DWP of a change in her circumstances. Judge Richard Griffith-Jones said: 'The problem I have is this: everyone is conscious of the constraint on public money, which is affecting all sorts of services. 'She has fiddled the public out of £57,000 when the National Health Service is striving to get machines to save people's lives and nurses have been having their pay held back.' He told Cooper: 'You effectively stole from the public; and I'm very sorry, but I can't overlook this. Husband and wife: Fraudster Cooper married Clifford Smith, 53, in September 2004 but continued to tell the authorities that she was a struggling single mother . 'At the end of the day a message has to be sent to people who are prepared to steal public money that the courts will seek to deter them from doing it.' Cooper, of Canley, Coventry, began claiming benefits legitimately but continued to pretend she was single after she got married to delivery driver Clifford Smith. Prosecutor Jane Sarginson said: 'On nine separate forms over the period of time she included changes of address etc; but whenever asked to indicate whether she had a partner she ticked the box to say she was single. 'She was married to Mr Smith, but even when interviewed she denied she was married and said they were just good friends. Benefits cheat: The mother-of-three was jailed for eight months at Leamington Spa Justice Centre for 'effectively stealing from the public' 'But on her Facebook page there is even a photograph of her in her wedding dress, as well as references to going shopping with her husband.' And not only was Cooper failing to declare her marital status, she also failed to declare that, for all but nine months over the nine years, she was working. Miss Sarginson added: 'She has had five different employers, and for a period of time she actually worked for Coventry City Council.' Cooper, whose jobs included working in care homes, had also worked for Brook Street UK, First Personnel, Professional Personnel and Ideal Care Homes - but only ever declared one period of employment. Ian Windridge, defending, said: 'The lady has clearly got herself into a situation of her own making. 'Having told the lie once, the lie has to go on; and so it continued, and she wasn't strong enough to break the cycle. 'This is not a lady who was living a lavish lifestyle. 'In terms of those who obtain large sums of money in one or two large transactions, this has only kept the family afloat to the tune of around £6,000 a year.' Mr Windridge added that Cooper has repaid £400. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'Most people claiming benefits are honest, but there are some who abuse the welfare system and we will catch them. 'Failure to report a change in circumstances may affect your benefit claim. For example if a partner moves in, you must tell us before it’s too late. Failing to do so is a crime.' A Coventry City Council spokesman said: 'This was a joint working case between the Council and the DWP and we are very happy with the outcome.'","Wendy Cooper, 44, of Coventry, married husband Clifford Smith, 53, in 2004 .

"Apple charges you £15 for a 'Lightning' charger cable for the new iPhone - or £30 for an adapter so that you can use your older accessories. Fans might be hoping they could bypass this additional cost with the help of third-party manufacturers creating cheaper versions of the cables. But it appears Apple has locked down its cables - adding an authentication chip which is likely to stop any other cables working with the £529 device. No entry: Apple appears to employ a chip within the Lightning cable, to stop unauthorised cables being used with the new iPhone . The Double Helix cable team took apart a Lightning cable in order to find the chip inside . Apple has come in for criticism before for shunning the rest of the industry's EU-directed move towards a standard micro-USB connection. And fans were left angry by the move to the Lightning connector which, while smaller and thinner, makes old accessories obsolete without the £30 adapter. The discovery of an authentication chip within the cable was revealed on AppleInsider, a website dedicated to the iPhone manufacturer. The site spoke to 'Peter', from the company Double Helix Cables, who pulled apart the cable which came with the new phone. From his investigation, the site warns iPhone owners not to purchase the cheap third-party Lightning chargers now appearing on eBay and other sites. Peter dismantled the Lightning connector and found what appear to be an authentication chip inside, located directly between the data cable and the power pin. Pricey cable: Apple sells its own propriety adapters on its website for £30 . Break from the past: Apple's senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller announcing the new lightning port two weeks ago . The new Apple iPhone 5 has had record-breaking sales, selling five million devices in the first weekend . The inclusion of a chip tallies with the reported increase in cost to produce the cable, costing an estimated $3.50 to Apple. AppleInsider said this was a 775 per cent increase on the costs of producing the previous cable. While some of that increase will be down to the new design and economies of scale, the addition of a chip will have sent the production price upwards. Peter said:'There is basically no way those are functional cables. 'You can't just build a Lightning cable by making something with the same shape and connectivity, and my teardown proves that. 'The chip has to be there, and it is directly in the signal path of the V+ wire.' He added that users would not be able to make a cable, or adapt an existing one - 'at least not without a precise dissection of an Apple-branded Lightning cable.'","Authentication chip appears to stop unauthorised cables being used with iPhone .

"The US Air Force is facing an investigation over why it destroyed 16 cargo planes worth nearly $500million and turned them into $32,000 of scrap metal. The fleet of 16 C-27As that were bought for the Afghan Army and stored in Kabul International Airport were taken apart to allegedly save costs as forces continue to withdraw from the country. It has prompted  an investigation by John Sopko, special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, who will question why there wasn't an effort to 'salvage' taxpayers' money. Destroyed: The fleet of 16 C-27As (one pictured) that were bought for the Afghan Army and stored in Kabul International Airport were taken apart to allegedly save costs as forces continue to withdraw from the country . Scrapped: The US Air Force now faces a probe as to why the planes, which cost $500million were turned into $32,000 of scrap metal. They will also be asked why the money wasn't 'salvaged' He asked Air Force Secretary Deborah James to . document all decisions made about the destruction of the aircraft. 'I am concerned that the officials responsible for planning . and executing the scrapping of the planes may not have . considered other possible alternatives in order to salvage . taxpayer dollars,' he said. Sopko also asked if any other parts of the planes had been . sold before they were destroyed by the Defense Logistics Agency. Sopko's office has been investigating the matter since . December 2013 after numerous non-profit groups and military . officials raised questions about funds wasted on the planes. The U.S. government spent $486 million to buy and refurbish . 20 older C-27A airplanes from Alenia, a unit of Italy's . Finmeccanica SpA, but later canceled the program . because a lack of spare parts was severely limiting their . availability for military use.Base: . Base: The refurbished planes were stored at Kabul International Airport for years but have now been scrapped . Questions: In an interview last year John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said it wasunclear if the move to take apart the planes was criminal fraud or mismanagement . Instead, the Pentagon decided to buy four larger C-130 . planes built by Lockheed Martin Corp to do the work. Pentagon spokesman Major Brad Avots said the U.S. military . decided to destroy the planes 'to minimize impact on drawdown of . U.S. forces in Afghanistan,' but would provide more information . after a review. Avots said the Pentagon and Air Force would consider various . options for the remaining four planes, including possible sale . to other parties. 'Working in a wartime environment such as Afghanistan brings . with it many challenges, and we continually seek to improve our . processes,' he said. Under used: In January 2013, the Pentagon's inspector general office said the aircraft flew only 234 of the 4,500 required hours fromJanuary through September 2012 . He said the U.S. military was also working to help . Afghanistan 'improve accountability and help instill sound . financial management practices in daily operations while . reducing the risk of fraud, waste and abuse.' In an interview last year with NBC News, Sopko said it was . unclear if the incident was criminal fraud or mismanagement, but . the waste was not an isolated incident in Afghanistan. The Pentagon's inspector general has also investigated the . issue, which the non-profit Project on Government Oversight . calls 'a shining example of the billions wasted in Afghanistan.' In January 2013, the Pentagon's inspector general office . said the aircraft flew only 234 of the 4,500 required hours from . January through September 2012.

"A video recording the comments a woman hears as she walks around the nation's biggest city is a testament to the pervasiveness of street harassment women face, its creators said Wednesday. The video, shot over 10 hours one day in neighborhoods all over the borough and edited down to a 2-minute final product, has set off a storm of outrage since it was released Tuesday. Rape threats have since been directed toward Shosana Roberts, the woman in the video, according to multiple reports. Scroll down for video . Unwanted attention: Shoshana Roberts, who appeared in the video showing the catcalling she experienced over a ten-hour period, has since been subject to rape threats online . Experiment: Roberts was reportedly subject to 108 instances of catcalling during the filming of the video . Traumatic: Roberts has said filming the video brought up her memories of sexual assaults . In the video, the comments come continuously as Roberts walks through the streets of Manhattan - 'What's up, Beautiful?' and 'Smile!' - and there's even a stretch when a man just silently walks right next to her for several minutes. The footage, which was shot and edited by Rob Bliss, was captured by a camera Bliss had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of Roberts, who was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and walked silently along. As of this writing, the video has already been viewed 12.3million times and there are over 59,000 comments on YouTube. Speaking about the experience of making the video, Roberts told The Post 'I felt like crying and I have occurrences in my past of sexual assault, so I wasn’t even aware necessarily of all the times people were saying things to me. I was just going over in my head and reliving, unfortunately, these memories while I was walking. I wanted to break down in tears.' 'I’m pretty sure I cried that night,' she also told the newspaper. 'I put on music. I took deep breaths. I hugged my boyfriend. I called my mom — I think that was right after the video. 'I called my mom just so I could hear that she loves me and that I was putting myself forward as a face for this cause because it’s something I really believe in and I needed to hear that she was proud of me, which she is.' Hidden camera: The footage was captured by a camera Rob Bliss had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of Roberts, who walked silently along . Stalked: One man walked next to Roberts for five minutes as she walked through New York City . Emily May, executive director of Hollaback!, the anti-street harassment organization that put out the video, told The Washington Post 'It’s hitting a nerve. Certainly, people are coming out of the woodwork and saying some really offensive and misogynist things. 'We’ve had a number of rape threats and violent threats against Shoshana and we’re pulling those down as quickly as possible, but they exist. That’s scary and I think what they’re trying to do is scare her and scare us into not speaking out about this. And both of us are saying no, we need to talk about this because if we don’t talk about this, if we don’t get this story out, then none of this is going to change.' Bliss told The Post 'I’m getting some blowback, but not nearly as bad as Shoshana. Right now she’s getting a lot of threats and things like that and it’s just so sad. It’s like the video is now being echoed in real life.' At no point did Roberts make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them. That didn't stop the comments from coming. When she didn't respond, one man told her, 'Somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful. You should say thank you more!' Everyday: Roberts said the number of comments the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her . Stares: At no point did Roberts make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them - but that didn't stop the comments from coming . May told the Associated Press 'This is having a very serious impact on the way we live our lives.' Roberts said the number of comments the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her. 'The frequency is something alarming,' she told the wire service. Martha Sauder, walking on a Manhattan street on Wednesday, agreed that street harassment is a problem and said it happens to her frequently. 'It's inappropriate. It's like an invasion of your space,' she told the AP. 'I'd like it to stop.' The video also has faced some online criticisms, among them that the men shown all seem to be minorities. Bliss and Roberts emphasized that the comments came from all racial groups, and Bliss said some interactions that were filmed couldn't be used for reasons like the audio was disrupted by passing sirens. 'My experience, what we documented, it was from everybody,' Roberts told the AP. Another criticism was that some men's comments seemed innocuous: 'Good morning,' 'Have a nice day.' Some men could have been 'genuinely being nice, Gerard Burke, a Brooklyn resident who readily acknowledged street harassment exists and has seen it happen to women in his family, told the AP. He said he thought the video shed light on a bigger problem, 'but some people just genuinely want to say hello.' That's the problem with street harassment, May told the wire service, because when there's a fear that a simple good morning could escalate into sexual comments or actions, there's a reluctance to engage at all.","A hidden camera video showing actress Shoshan Roberts receiving comments from men on the street has been viewed over 11.8million times .

"He has a loyal band of followers, especially among supporters of his pro-gun policies, but Republican candidate Thomas C. Foley has lost a few votes among the residents of his hometown. A long-running controversy over the 'disappearance' of a nature island from the lake by his mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, continues to haunt the GOP nominee, who goes by Tom Foley. The mysterious vanishing act of the quarter-acre island occurred in 2003 but has remained a sore spot for locals in the well-to-do area. According to The Stamford Advocate, Foley was the force behind the major $1.5 million dredging of Khakum Wood Lake. Empty: Khakum Wood Lake in Greenwich, Connecticut is missing a nature island that once sat in the water after a dredging operation swallowed up the island . Popular: The island was described as 'beautiful' and was a favorite picnic spot among locals.

Foley - who goes by Tom Foley - is a Republican nominee in the 2014 election . His sprawling home is one of eight built around the man-made lake, which Foley thought had become overgrown. The dredging was to stop it from becoming a swampland. However when the water was drained, the island - a bird-nesting area over-run with red maple trees and a popular picnic spot - subsequently collapsed. 'It was a beautiful island, honestly,' a source told The Stamford Advocate. 'They did not have permission to remove the island.' Neither Foley nor anyone else was found to be at fault for what happened. It was determined the collapse was accidental. 'We've never really found anything specious,' said the director of the town's Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency, Michael Chambers. 'He is not the guilty party. 'To my recollection, everything was done by the book.' The town of Greenwich, Connecticut, is an affluent and pretty spot in Fairfield County . Affluent: Pictured here is the town of Greenwich, Connecticut, where Tom Foley lives . Chambers said that they looked into building another island. Some thought Foley should have to pay for it.

"A  woman allegedly dug up her father's grave in search of his 'real will' in a move she insists he would have been 'okay' with. Melanie Nash, 52, is accused of conspiring with three others to remove her father Eddie's remains from Colebrook Village Cemetery in New Hampshire in May. The vault of the businessman, who died of a heart attack aged 68 in 2004, was found cracked with the casket opened and his remains ransacked. His body was left intact. Plot: Melanie Nash (right), 52, is accused of conspiring with three others to remove her father Eddie's remains from Colebrook Village Cemetery in New Hampshire in May. Mr Nash (right) died of a heart attack in 2004 . In a  police statement, Nash wrote she had met up with Ginette Dowse, 71, Michael Day, 37, and David Grey, 57, to dig up her father, whom she believed had been buried with 'the real will'. 'All this was done for the right reasons and I know my father would be OK with it...,' she said in the statement obtained by The Caledonian Record. 'What we all did was to dig up my father's coffin, Eddie Nash, looking for documents. We did it with respect.' However, after ransacking her father's remains, Nash found only a packet of cigarettes in his hand, a police affidavit said. 'You hear of grave robbing 100, 150 years ago,' Jenkins and Newman Funeral Home Director Michael Pearson told the station WMUR earlier this year. 'You don't think of it in 2014.' According to prosecutors, Nash told police she did not receive anything when her father died and had been thinking of digging up the grave for years to prove her sister, Susie Nash, 'hid the will'. Ransacked: The vault of Mr Nash  was found cracked with the casket opened and his remains ransacked . However, Susie Nash  said there was only one will when her father's estate plan was done in 1995 and everyone involved knew about it. Last month, Nash's lawyer, William Albrecht, filed a motion saying the suspect's police statement should be excluded from the case because it violates her right against self-incrimination. But Coos County Attorney John McCormick said Nash showed her 'free will' in coming to police and waiving her Miranda rights. Mr Nash, a one-time dairy farmer, started a successful heavy equipment business in 1979, still run by his family.

"The Marine Corps helped rescue a Boy Scout troop that got lost while canoeing on the Colorado River. According to the Yuma Sun, the 32-member troop in 16 canoes ended up stranded when they couldn't find their way out of an area of dense, tall reeds. The group was reported missing late Saturday after they failed to check in at their destination. Lost: A boy scout troop on a canoeing trip of the Colorado River were lost all day in an overgrown lake until Marine helicopter's led them back on a route to safety . The Yuma County Sheriff's Office asked the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma for help when searchers couldn't locate the troop despite searching for over two hours. Marine Capt. Wes Urquhart says his crew used night-vision goggles to spot the troop in a lake that connects to the river. Urquhart says then was able to guide boats carrying sheriff's personnel to the vicinity, and those boats then escorted the canoes to a landing. 'The deputies said they knew the Scouts were lost and were east of the river somewhere,' Urquhart told the Yuma Sun. 'They had been searching but couldn't find them, so they requested aerial support, as it was getting dark.' It only took the helicopter crew moments to find the troop after they put on their night vision goggles. The troops were hidden behind tall reeds on an overgrown lake. 'They got themselves pretty deep into the estuaries and couldn't find their way back out. I can see how someone could easily get lost in there because those reeds are really tall,' Urquhart said. 'Finding them was actually the easiest part. They flashed us with some of their flashlights as well.' After locating the troop, the crew hovered over a nearby ridge to let off Navy Corpsman Alexander Camacho to check on their medical condition. 'I wanted to make sure everyone was in good health and good condition and that there were no medical injuries that needed to be addressed,' Camacho said. To the rescue: The troop was saved by the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma troops who wore night vision goggles as they flew a helicopter over the Colorado River looking for the scouts (stock picture) 'Everybody said they were fine but just a little tired from being lost all day.' While Camacho was doing his well-being check, Urquhart circled the area to find the best place for them to paddle back to the river. 'When we did find a path for them to leave, the estuary was pretty well enclosed,' Urquhart said. 'From the air it was obvious it was a throughway, but from the ground, they probably couldn't see that at all.' Urquhart flew at a low altitude and dropped biodegradable sticks from the helicopter to the water to show them which way they needed to go. Camacho said he stayed with them to keep them calm. 'Pretty much the whole time I was on the ground with them, it was just keeping them calm and making sure they stayed together,' Camacho said. 'I also instructed the scout masters to have one canoe in front of the group and one in back to make sure everyone got out safely.' Urquhart then picked up Camacho and led the scouts through the reeds by using a spotlight to show where the deputy's boats were. 'It was a crew effort. It all went pretty smoothly,' Urquhart said. 'It was done just like we train.' The Boy Scouts finally met up with the sheriff’s deputies who escorted them the rest of the way home while Urquhart and his crew made sure no one was left behind in the dark.","The Marine Corps helped rescue a Boy Scout troop that got lost while canoeing on the Colorado River .

"The end of major roadworks is always a cause for celebration. Residents on one street, who had suffered disruption and delays for 19 months, were so delighted that the work was finally complete they threw a party. They adorned Chilwell Road in Nottingham with bunting, blew up balloons and set up the children’s face painting stall, while local businesses stocked up in preparation for a busy weekend. But the street’s jubilant mood soon fell flat – when it turned out the roadworks were not finished after all. Residents of the street in Nottingham were dismayed to learn the road works would be going on for another month (file image) The project to extend the city’s tram network was already nearly a year behind schedule – with the road originally due to reopen shortly after Christmas 2013. The work, which was meant to be completed in time for the party on Saturday, will now not be finished until the end of November. Julie Cameron, 50, owns a gift shop on the street, which she spent last week painting and decorating in preparation for the grand reopening.

"Choosing to get up on stage to tell jokes for a living while battling anxiety would be the job from hell for most people but not for Felicity Ward - she sees it as a gift. ‘I really love being on stage - it’s a lot of fun making people laugh it’s a really good job,’ she said. ‘Sometimes I was just performing for my life thinking “I’ve just got to get through this” but now I’ve got a dream job – sometimes they don’t laugh at me but that’s alright.’ Working as a comedian hasn’t always been enjoyable for the 34-year-old, who spends half her time in Europe and the other half at home in Australia, she had to hit rock bottom before climbing her way back to the top again. Scroll down for video . Felicity Ward takes up the challenge of breaking down the stigmas around mental health . Ward's life began to spiral completely out of control three years ago almost ending her award-winning career . A self-confessed binger drinker, Ward made the tough decision to give up alcohol more than seven years ago because she was simply sick of feeling sad. Then slowly but surely anxiety began to creep into her life until three years ago when she turned 30 and her life began to spiral completely out of control almost ending her award-winning career. ‘I had this other heckler in my head talking incessantly telling me that I’m a piece of sh** and that I should get off stage, and that I’m going to wet myself, and that these people hate me, and I should just leave,’ she said. ‘I would always be drawn to the green exit light in every venue, so I had to not look at that or the little voice in my head would say ""get off stage - run through that door"" so that was happening for 15 minutes of an hour-long show for months.’ In Ward’s ‘craziest’ period she began having angry conversations with herself before going on stage. ‘I was telling my anxiety that it needed to p*** off for an hour and if it wanted to come back double strength that’s fine,’ she said. ‘You find yourself cutting deals with your mental illness, so that just got unbearable and I was going to stop doing stand-up so I had to go and get help.’ Singer/songwriter Missy Higgins speaks of having depression as a teenager and experiencing a breakdown while she was at school . Hip hop artist, 360, stopped drinking alcohol and began exercising regularly after suffering from anxiety attacks when he first rose to fame . Ward sought help and used her anxiety as part of her stand-up act in her comedy show, Honestly, a few years ago. She has also learnt that regular sleep and exercise is vital for her frame of mind. ‘Seeing a therapist was nothing short of a miracle from how bad it was to how good it got so quickly with her,’ she said. ‘I think the biggest fear is that if you go to see one it is validating that you are insane but the thing is it’s fine to have a mental illness.’ ‘One in five Australians had a mental illness in the last 12 months – that’s 20 per cent of our country – that’s a national emergency.’ She has learnt to embrace her mental health and to manage it through regular sleep and exercise. She also feels privileged that she had chosen a job that gives her the platform to speak candidly about her condition. Her candidness about the topic led to the ABC approaching Ward to do a documentary on anxiety and she jumped at the chance. Hence Felicity’s Mental Mission was born, where she takes up the challenge of breaking down the stigmas around mental health. Teaming up with Mental Health Australia, Ward bravely takes on a mission to get 3,000 promises on their online ‘promise wall’. If her campaign is successful, she promises to face her fears and fly upside down in a stunt plane. Ward was frustrated to discover that when she started telling her comedy pals about her anxiety that many of them also suffered from the condition but had never discussed it with her . Teaming up with Mental Health Australia, Ward bravely takes on a mission to get 3,000 promises on their online ‘promise wall’ A study in the U.K of 500 comedians showed that the people who worked on the stage had high levels of psychotic personality traits. ‘We are often highly neurotic and sensitive – we just need a hug,’ Ward said. Ward was frustrated to discover that when she started telling her comedy pals about her anxiety that many of them also suffered from the condition but had never discussed it with her. ‘When I started to get well I told them about it and I was so angry that they didn’t tell me,’ she said. ‘I just wanted them to tell me so I didn’t feel like a freak - that’s when I realised how little we talk about this.’ It’s not just fellow comedians who share their stories in the two-part documentary but also Australian musicians Missy Higgins and rapper 360. ‘I’m very grateful and felt very privileged that I got to speak to them and they felt comfortable enough to speak to me about it,’ she said. ‘Missy experienced pretty full on depression as a teenager and she had a breakdown while she was at school and she spoke plainly about how she has been on and off medication at different points in her life.’ Hip hop artist, 360, spoke about starting to get anxiety attacks when he first rose to fame. ‘Exercise has become imperative to him – he’ a really big advocate of that and he stopped drinking as well because he was using it to medicate for his anxiety,’ she said. The most confronting moment while filming the documentary was when Ward had a panic attack on camera after she was asked to sing a song with two other comedians. The most confronting moment while filming the documentary was when Ward had a panic attack on camera after she was asked to sing a song with two other comedians . ‘I walked up to the director and said I was having a panic attack and that I couldn’t do it and she said “I know this sounds insensitive but would you mind going with you diary cam”.’ Surprisingly, Ward did not find it daunting to talking through such a personal moment on camera. ‘I just talked about my anxiety attack and just tried to explain the physical and mental effect that it was taking ,how it was caused and what the repercussions are so that people understand what it is like to have an anxiety attack,’ she said. Although Ward has learnt to manage with her anxiety – she still goes for the occasional ‘top–up’ with her counsellor every now and then when she starts to see the cracks showing. ‘Things as simple as I found myself stuttering a lot when I was on and off stage and that was a little indication that I was getting mentally loose or I wasn’t getting enough sleep – I learnt a couple of little red flags,’ she said. Felicity's Mental Mission airs on Monday, October 6 at 8.30pm on ABC2 and also an encore screening Thursday, October 16 at 9.30pm on ABC.

"When a photographer  took a trip to one of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's pet projects - built to bring in thousands of foreign tourists to the country - he discovered a sparkling clean ski resort... with barely another person or drop of snow in sight. The communist enclave's one and only ski destination, on top of Taehwa Peak, boasts a hotel with wood cabin style rooms, complimentary toiletries, and spa facilities and 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes. However, photographer Aram Pan, from Singapore, who took the photos while on his fourth trip to North Korea from 16-20 October, did not find any other tourists to mingle with. 'I saw one western tourist on a ""private tour"" at the Ski resort. I’m not sure who he was. I didn't ask,' Mr Pan told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Ski lifts were bought from China to transport visitors to the 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes. They were originally going to be bought from Switzerland but the deal was blocked because of trade sanctions . The Masikryong ski resort was built on top of Taehwa Peak, near the port city and naval base Wonsan, in just 10 months . Photographer Aram Pan was given access to photograph the wood cabin style bedrooms, including this one in the 'Second Class Accommodation' ‘Other than that, there’s only the locals working on several upgrades before the winter season. ‘There’s no snow now so I had expected it to be empty,’ he added. Mr Pan said the lack of people didn't matter to him, as his five day vacation gave him the chance 'to capture the autumn colours and also do an exclusive full access tour of the Masikryong Ski Resort during their off-peak season’. The Masikryong ski resort, built on top of Taehwa Peak, near the port city and naval base Wonsan, opened for business earlier this year and hopes to bring 5,000 visitors a day. A ski-less Kim Jong-Un visited the resort when it had snowy surroundings at the end of last year . The Dome Cafe at Masikryong Ski Resort has a fake green grass floor and wicker chairs for skiers to enjoy refreshments in . The Dome Cafe is a strange structure constructed next the ski resort's tiered hotel building . A cafe in the Masikryong Hotel lobby has coffee bean pictures on its walls and purple plush chairs alongside its questionable interior design . His (left) and her (right) hair salons are available on site with a collection of permitted styles pictured on the walls for customers to choose from . The massage room in the hotel spa features two beds, which can be divided by a curtain for privacy . Mr Pan said the pools 'are especially nice since the weather outside is cold and the water is nice and warm' The pool was complete and ready for swimmers to enjoy but nobody was swimming lengths in October . A large sauna room is big enough for many visitors to sweat it out but when Mr Pan visited there was nobody using it . The steam room with white plastic seats was also empty but looked sparkling clean . Full body dryers stood side by side and basic showers were provided in the spa area . Treadmills, a bicycle and cross-trainer machines are offered up for visitors to keep their fitness up while on vacation . The sprawling 1,400-hectare resort was built in just ten months as part of a push by leader Kim Jong-un to increase overseas tourist numbers from 200,000 to 1 million per annum by 2016. Although tourists and official regime photographers have taken some photos of the resort before, Mr Pan was given exclusive access to all parts of the destination – apart from two prized new areas that are still under construction... ‘I was permitted to photograph a comprehensive collection of images of the entire facility. The only stuff I wasn’t permitted to photograph was the new helicopter landing pad currently being built and the latest extension to their ski lift system that is also under construction,’ he explained. Mr Pan stayed in the onsite hotel in a 'third-class room' and tried out the facilities, including a gym, sauna, hairdressers, and restaurant and had the whole place to himself. An onsite ski shop sells a limited range of goods, including bright coloured trainers, backpacks and sports clothing . Bottled water and other soft drinks are sold in the food section of the shop in refrigerators . Visitors can hire skis and snow boots from the resort. At the end of last year, a ski-less Kim Jong-Un was photographed surveying the then snowy surroundings during his visit . For guests looking to party, there is a karaoke and dance room with coloured lighting and a marble floor . A female worker stands behind the bar at the hotel, smiling in a smart uniform . ‘The pools are especially nice since the weather outside is cold and the water is nice and warm,’ he said. At the end of last year, a ski-less Kim Jong-Un was photographed surveying the snowy surroundings during his visit. The leader was said to note 'with great satisfaction' that everything was 'impeccable'. He also gave instructions to serve visitors to the site well - and ensure they may 'keenly feel the loving care of the party', local media reported. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) described the slopes as a 'great monumental structure in the era of Songun', referring to the nation's 'military first' policy. Wooden table and chairs stand in an empty dining room during the off-peak season . A mismatch of styles is used in another dining area, including a floor that has fake grass and fake patio on it . A pool table is provided for holiday goers to play on inside the resort on top of Taehwa Peak . Mr Pan stayed in a 'third class' room (right), where he was provided with complimentary white hotel slippers (left) Some rather clinical lighting gave the bathroom a yellow-hue but it was clear everything was brand new . Free North Korean toiletries were provided in Mr Pan's en-suite bathroom . The military played a leading role in the project, with soldiers from the Korean People’s Army helping to build it. Hundreds of snow canons from Sweden are used to keep the resort looking its best and there are also Italian snow-ploughs and Canadian snow mobiles . But in August 2013 a $8.5 million deal with a Swiss ski-lift manufacturer was blocked by the Swiss government based on UN laws that prohibit certain export sales to North Korea. The communist-regime got around the issue by buying their ski-lifts closer to home. ‘In case you are wondering where they got the ski lifts because of the embargo, they brought them in from China. I rode on all of the Chinese ski lifts and they felt safe and stable,’ Mr Pan said. For more photos from Aram Pan's North Korea trips visit his website and Facebook page.

"A YouTube video which teaches viewers how to turn themselves into a Barbie doll has been revealed as the most-watched make-up tutorial on the site after racking up nearly 60 million views, according to WWD. The video, which was created in 2009 by YouTube star Michelle Phan, offers viewers a step-by-step guide to creating the perfect plastic look and includes everything from finding the ideal eyeshadow shades - pink, blue and white - to sourcing the best accessories - anything pink, of course. While recreating the look on her own face, Phan throws in a series of helpful tips such as: 'Barbie's skin is flawless so start off with acne serum that reduces blemishes and large pores.' Scroll down for video . Michelle's millions: The Barbie tutorial has been watched  more than 57 million times . Spot the difference!

"A young lecturer who weighed 21 stone due to gorging on ready meals, crisps and up to four litres of Coke a day has lost more than a third of his bodyweight through a strict new fitness regime. Daniel Sutton, 26, from Bath, gained weight on a student diet of full English breakfasts, pizza and an addiction to fizzy drinks. After a doctor made an offhand comment about his weight, he began walking to work, running and taking military fitness classes, tracking his progress using his smartphone. After losing eight and a half stone in seven months, he looked so different some people did not recognise him in the street. He has now run a 10km assault course in under an hour and a half for charity, and has even been pursued by a girl for the first time. Scroll down for video . Daniel Sutton, 26, lost eight and a half stone after changing his diet and attending military fitness classes . Mr Sutton said: ‘Losing the weight has also given me a completely new body and face, which I am still getting used to - but I love my new appearance. ‘I couldn’t walk the 500m from work to my car without breaking into a sweat before and now I walk up a 4km hill to work with ease. ‘Some people don’t recognise me any more - I've had to re-introduce myself to people I know, which is funny. ‘It felt like I was wearing a mask, but now people’s reactions to me are different. ‘But my mum said, the mask is off now, this is the real you. And she’s right.’ Mr Sutton said he slowly gained weight as a teenager because of a general lack of knowledge about health and fitness, and his habit of snacking on chocolate. He said: ‘The weight slowly built up ever since I was 13. I was always big, but not massive. ‘I was always the same amount of stones as my age.' Living at home with his parents, there was plenty of fresh food food for him to make fairly healthy meals with. Mr Sutton said: 'I didn’t have to go shopping and so all the food was there, so I could make fairly healthy meals easily with all the food in the house. ‘But if I was hungry, and I fancied a chocolate bar, I’d eat it. ‘If I liked the look of something I’d just eat it without thinking about it.’ By the time Mr Sutton was 26 he weighed 21 stone, eating pizza, takeaways and up to four litres of cola a day . A doctor making a comment about his weight spurred Mr Sutton into joining British Military Fitness classes which he now attends three times a week . By the time he left home at 18 to study maths at Bath university, he weighed 18 stone. At university, his diet deteriorated even further as he began to eat lots of processed food, takeaways as well as fizzy drinks and nights out with lots of alcohol. He said: ‘I’d eat microwave ready meals or meal deal lunches which always involved a big white baguette. ‘Now looking back I could have just eaten brown bread and halved the calories. BEFORE . Breakfast: Full English breakfast . Lunch: Ham or cheese white baguette with lots of mayonnaise . Dinner: Pizza, a ready meal or a takeaway . Drinks: Cola, beer and port . Snacks: Crisps, chocolate . AFTER . Breakfast: Three Weetabix with soy milk or low fat plain yoghurt with fruit . Mid morning: Protein shake, a Ryvita biscuit and a banana . Lunch: Chicken or ham sandwiches made with wholemeal bread, and mustard . Dinner: Soup with wholemeal bread . Drink: Water, no alcohol . Snacks: Snack a Jacks, baked crisps or fruit . ‘Pizza was a favourite. Or Chinese. I was definitely eating kebabs on a Friday night. ‘And huge mixed grills. I would go on JustEat and I needed to make up the delivery price so I’d add in loads of other stuff.’ He also began to drink up to four litres of Coke a day, the equivalent of more than 40 cubes of sugar. He said: ‘I drank enough to warrant sponsorship from Coke. ‘You can get Coke points. I wasn’t that bothered but my housemate loved it because I drank so much he could have my points. ‘I was drinking between two and four litres a day. ‘You get offers from the supermarket, two 500ml cokes for £1.50. ‘Then you get another one with a meal deal at lunch, then I’d buy another two litre one and drink that. He would also drink a lot of beer and port, usually four or five on regular student nights out. After finishing a PhD in maths, he moved to London to work as a software developer, but working long hours meant he still relied on processed food from the company canteen and ready meals in the evenings. He said: ‘When I started at the company I’d skip breakfast, then I’d go for a full English with my team in my break. ‘They had everything in it: bacon, sausages, fried eggs, the standard. ‘They did have healthy options like porridge but I never went for that.’ 'The motivation to lose weight came when he realised his high BMI meant he was classified as obese and his GP made a remark about his weight. After getting fit, Mr Sutton was able to run a 10km assault course race in one hour and 17 minutes, raising £150 for charity . He said: ‘I had a pain in my knee, an annoying twingy pain. ‘The doctor said “You could do with losing a few pounds” 'He didn’t say “You’re going to die”. 'But I joined the gym the next day. I’d been thinking about losing weight for a while, but now I thought I was actually going to do it.' He began running on the treadmill, going to the gym every other day. A friend’s jibes gave him the motivation to keep going. He said: ‘One of my friends and I would always have banter. ‘We’d argue to the bitter end about different things. ‘But at the end of the argument, if he was losing he would always say “Yeah but I can run faster than you.” ‘When I started training I wanted to prove him wrong.’ Delighted to be offered a job as a research assistant at his old university, Mr Sutton moved back to Bath in June to start work. He also discovered military fitness bootcamps. He said: ‘I thought bootcamps were where people ran around in gymnasiums. Mr Sutton has now been pursued by a girl for the first time. He said: ‘Now one girl pestered me. I didn’t have in my head how to deal with the situation because I’d never had that before' ‘But it was intense. There was this massive bodybuilder in this skin tight t-shirt. ‘He was the instructor. He’s from the Valleys and has a booming Welsh accent. ‘The warm up involved four lengths of a 100m sprint. ‘At the time I was thinking about making the gap between me and the back of the group smaller. ‘That was just the warm up. ‘Then we had to run through marshland. We did all sorts: 20 press ups, 20 star jumps. ‘I said to myself if I could complete one of these classes it was an achievement. ‘I dragged myself through.’ He began to attend the bootcamps twice a week, and carried on going to the gym on other days. Soon he had moved from the blue ‘beginner’ bibs at the military fitness class to the red ‘intermediate’ group who carry out more repetitions. He changed his diet, cutting out ready meals in favour of sandwiches, soups and fruit. He began to make small changes such as walking to work, taking different routes to increase the calories burned and tracking his fitness using his smartphone. On a recent holiday to a remote island near Crete he was even able to walk an hour each day carrying ten litres of water, a far cry from when he struggled to walk 500m. He was also able to run a 10km assault course race in one hour and 17 minutes, raising £150 for charity. Mr Sutton changed his diet, cutting out the ready meals, full English breakfasts he used to eat in favour of sandwiches, soups and fruit . His dramatic change in appearance also saw him pursued romantically for the first time. He said: ‘I was lucky – I was never bullied about my weight. I was always confident giving talks, I was the big confident guy. ‘I had a couple of girlfriends growing up, but I wouldn’t be confident approaching girls I liked. ‘Now one girl pestered me. She was always around wanting to chat. ‘I didn’t have in my head how to deal with the situation because I’d never had that before.' Becoming more healthy has given him a renewed sense of purpose and wellbeing. He said: ‘I feel more content now, there’s this huge sense of purpose. ‘I’d procrastinated about myself and my health for too long. 'I’ve realised, if you experiment with fitness tracking, tweak things, you find something that might work for you. ‘With all the apps, it’s become convenient to be healthy. ‘It’s great, and it’s only going to get better.’ For more information on British Military Fitness, click here .","Daniel Sutton, 26, who lives in Bath, ballooned to 21 stone by age 26 .

"A Libyan militant on Monday pleaded not guilty to charges arising from the 2012 Benghazi attacks that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. Ahmed Abu Khattala, 43, entered the plea through his lawyer in a 15-minute court proceeding before a federal judge. An 18-count grand jury indictment handed up last week makes Abu Khattala eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Suspect: This undated file image obtained from Facebook shows Ahmed Abu Khattala, an alleged leader of the deadly 2012 attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya . Abu Khattala's lawyer, federal public defender Michelle Peterson, said she is waiting for the Justice Department to turn over additional material — much of it classified — on the charges her client faces. The next court date in the case was set for December 9. Abu Khattala's lawyer has said previously that the government has failed to show Abu Khattala was connected to the attacks. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael DiLorenzo said the government so far has provided the defense with 150 hours of videotape and 4,000 pages of documents. The charges against Abu Khattala include murder of an internationally protected person, murder of an officer and employee of the United States and killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility. Abu Khattala is the first militant to be prosecuted for the Benghazi attacks. The September 11, 2012, attack by militants killed Stevens and communications specialist Sean Smith and set the mission ablaze. Nearly eight hours later at a CIA complex nearby, two more Americans, contract security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, died in a mortar attack that showed clear military training, retired Gen. Carter Ham told Congress in closed-door testimony earlier this year. The administration apprehended Abu Khattala in June and brought him to the United States to stand trial on terrorism charges.

"Charged: Danny Sevilla, 33, was pulled out of his car Friday then charged with drunk driving in the wrong direction . A Chicago police officer has been charged with drunk driving down a freeway in the wrong direction at 6am. Danny Sevilla, 33, was pulled out of his car by colleagues Friday morning after speeding north towards downtown Chicago in the southbound lane. Other motorists told how they chased him and slammed down on their horns when Sevilla drove down the exit ramp on the I-57 freeway at 5.45am. The bystanders managed to catch up with Sevilla, driving in a black Mitsubishi Outlander, open the door and cut the ignition, the Chicago Tribune reported. Police later turned up and patted him down - finding out in the process that he had a gun. Sevilla, driving in a black Mitsubishi Outlander, was relieved of police powers and put on admin duties instead. Police sources say he seemed drunk when they got him out of the car. They found that he had a gun. Jujuan Williams,42, was driving to the gym when he came across Sevilla. He said: 'With trucks coming...he was definitely headed for a head on collision if we hadn't stopped him.' Nobody was injured during the incident, and nothing got hit, as freeway traffic was light at that hour. Sevilla was the only one in the car.

"A father has been charged with murder after allegedly stabbing his live-in girlfriend and their seven-year-old daughter to death in their home on Sunday. Maciej Kotlinski, 35, faces two counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Ania Kosinska, 34, and Victoria Kotlinski in their Chicago, Illinois home. He also allegedly murdered their dog and cat. The bodies of the mother and daughter showed signs that their killer had tried to decapitate them, police told the Chicago Tribune.

Kotlinski's parents alerted police, who found Kotlinski nearby with a knife to his neck. Authorities had to shoot the man twice with a Taser to get him to drop the knife and he was transported to a medical center for treatment of a self-inflicted neck wound. Chicago Police carried out a welfare check on the couple's home in the 3400 block of North Odell Avenue and found the woman and child stabbed to death, authorities said.

"A dog trainer from Pennsylvania recreated the car from the Dumb Dumber movie starring Jim Carey and the late Chris Farley and later starring Jeff Daniels as his woofing new business vehicle and more customers have already begun biting. Matthew Kerr of St. Thomas wanted his new dog training business Matt's Mutts University to stand out so he created a personalized car based on the Mutt Cuts car from the 1994 comedy film Dumb and Dumber.

Kerr says that he used six blankets to cover the vehicle which he simply pasted on with an adhesive. His wife then stitched the ears and filled them with insulation. 'The nose was ingenious,' he says as he explains how he used an aluminium turkey pan from the dollar store. He smoothed it down and later painted it black.

Lane Rouch and her parents Jennifer and Chad, who are self-confessed 'Disnerds', visit one of the Orlando-based Disney parks once or twice a week in order to showcase the youngster's never-ending collection of Disney-inspired ensembles and have, unsurprisingly, become one of the most popular attractions at the tourist site.

And while the Rouch's well-dressed daughter managed to slip under the radar on her first few visits, it wasn't long before her unique outfits became the talk of the park. After dressing as Tarzan's Jane Porter for the park's 'Dapper Day', the young Disney fan was even invited to attend a special Beauty and the Beast-themed event where she was treated to a tea party with talking tea cup Chip, a story from the beautiful Belle and a dance with the Beast. But the highlight of the evening, mom Jennifer told the Huffington Post, was the standing ovation that Lane, who dressed up as Belle for the evening, received from her fellow guests as she and the Beast made their way through the Disney Castle restaurant. 'The music from the from the movie swelled up and the entire restaurant stood up and applauded our little girl, the beauty and the beast,' Jennifer recalled.

"Rapists and child abusers are escaping punishment and being allowed to walk free by police if they say sorry to their victims. New figures show that some those accused of sexual offences are being handed community resolution orders, also known as restorative justice. The orders are often used to punish youths so they do not get a criminal record and usually involve the offender making a verbal or written apology to their victim. Scroll down for video . New figures show that some those accused of sex crimes escape prosecution by apologising to their victims (file pic posed by a model) However, it is now emerged that in 2012/13, Wiltshire Police dealt with around 30 serious sexual offences, which included rape and sexual activity with a child, by handing out a community resolution order. In a return check last year, it found 58 people accused of sexual offence allegations, including five of rape, were handed the orders. Crime statistics for the Wiltshire force area show that between May 2013 and July 2014, there were 142 violent and sexual crimes. Now victims' groups have spoken out and criticised the procedure saying it does not send a tough message to offenders that their behaviour is unacceptable. Details of the practice at Wiltshire Police were revealed in a report by HM Inspectorate of Constabularies, which branded their use of community resolution orders for sexual offences as 'unacceptable'. The report states: 'An internal report in 2012/13 concludes that “Wiltshire Police has intentionally or inadvertently, manipulated the recording of sexual offences and thereby improved the perception of performance”. 'The report estimates the number of rapes not recorded at around 50, and that around 30 serious sexual offences were dealt with by way of community resolutions including rape and sexual activity with a child. Details of the practice of giving community orders to sex offenders at Wiltshire Police, pictured, were revealed in a report by HM Inspectorate of Constabularies . 'The latest force checks have identified some 58 such outcomes, of which, in the previous year, five were for rape crimes.' Jon Brown from the NSPCC told the Daily Express: 'The justice system needs to be more victim focused, and not a reflection on whether the perpetrator deserved prison or not. Conservative MP Nick de Bois, who has said he will be calling on the Government to review the use of the orders . 'A custodial sentence for serious sexual offences is the only way to send a clear message that society will not accept their behaviour.' However the report added that  the force, headed by new chief constable Patrick Geenty, had made considerable investment into changing the culture, in making sure all offences are recorded. It comes after Mailonline revealed last month through figures obtained through Freedom of Information laws, that people arrested on suspicion of rape, child rape, creating child porn, child abduction and sexually abusing a mental patient escaped prosecution by apologising. The shocking figures from 38 of England and Wales' police forces show resolution orders were used in 30 rape cases, including 21 involving children. One of the orders was given to a care worker in the West Midlands who caused a mental patient to engage in a penetrative sex act. Five other orders involved kidnap or abduction, 75 were for sexually assaulting young children, and 284 sexual assaults were passed off with an apology. Conservative MP Nick de Bois, who sits on the Commons justice committee, said he would be calling on the Government to review the orders. He said: 'It's shocking that offenders who admit to serious criminal offences are being offered the chance to say sorry and walk away from answering in a court of law for their crimes.' The data also showed that overall restorative justice had allowed 256,816 crimes to pass without offenders going to court in the last three-and-a-half years.","Figures show sex offenders are being handed community resolution orders .

"Almost 70,000 problem families have had their lives turned around following a crackdown on truancy, worklessness and anti-social behaviour. Ministers boasted that more than half of England’s troubled families are now back on track. Dedicated key workers have been sent into the homes of a total of 120,000 families which cost the taxpayer up to £9billion in police callouts, truancy, vandalism and social work. New figures show how almost 70,000 families have been 'turned around' by dedicated council teams . The troubled families programme was launched by David Cameron in 2011 to tackle the deep-seated problems that blight parts of the country, mainly in inner-city areas. It was claimed that up to £8billion of the £9billion was spent reacting to the problems created and experienced by these families, and not tackling their causes. The number of agencies dealing with problem families was cut, after research showed as many as 20 different organisations could be involved in dealing with the same family. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘The Troubled Families programme demonstrates exactly what our long-term economic plan means for people. ‘New opportunities for families to turn their lives around and make something of themselves; more economic security for local communities blighted by worklessness; and more economic stability for taxpayers, as we reduce the bills for social failure and get this country living within its means.’ The £450million scheme, launched in 2011, set a target of helping 120,000 families by 2015. Today the Department for Communities and Local Government said 690,000 have had their lives ‘turned around’ and councils’ dedicated teams were working with a total of 117,000 families. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the troubled families programme had been a success at cutting truancy, youth crime and unemployment . Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander added: ‘This government has turned around the lives of thousands of troubled families, transforming prospects for younger people and creating a fairer society. ‘Unlike previous governments, we’ve brought together multiple services to finally deal with complex problems in a more effective and efficient way. ‘Given that these issues previously cost an estimated £9 billion a year, that’s great news for taxpayers too.’ By August this year, Birmingham city council had turned around 2,141 families, Liverpool 1,677, Leeds 1,604 and Manchester 1,584. Louise Casey, head of the Troubled Families programme, said: ‘This programme is working so effectively because it deals with the whole family and all of their problems, with 1 key worker going in through the front door and getting to grips with an average of 9 different problems, rather than a series of services failing to engage or get the family to change.’","Government claims 70,000 have been helped by dedicated teams .

The Concept Van measures just 30ft by 13ft, but the cutting-edge design allows the same area to be used for different functions at different times.

"A school has transformed standards of behaviour after hiring former Royal Navy personnel to patrol corridors and eject disruptive pupils from lessons. Charter Academy in Portsmouth deployed a team of three retired naval staff - including an ex-Royal Marine - to help enforce consistent discipline and provide boys with positive male role models. The former sailors – part of the school’s pastoral staff – insisted on high standards of behaviour around the school and in the playground and even drove to pupils’ homes if they failed to turn up in the morning and brought them to lessons. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron speaks to students during a visit to the Ark Charter Academy School in Portsmouth . The initiative was praised by David Cameron yesterday as he visited the comprehensive to launch a package of measures aimed at turning round failing schools. Plans include giving powers to a new network of commissioners to intervene immediately in failing schools and order changes such as new uniform policies and setting by ability. An elite corps of 1,500 expert teachers will also be built up and dispatched around the country to boost under-performing schools. Mr Cameron hailed the role of the former military personnel as he toured Charter Academy and suggested other schools adopt similar schemes. ‘I was delighted to meet the former Royal Navy personnel who have made such a difference to behaviour and discipline at the Charter Academy in Portsmouth. They have played a key role in the dramatic turnaround at this school under their brilliant head teacher Dame Sharon Hollows,’ he said. The comprehensive has transformed standards of behaviour after hiring former Royal Navy personnel to patrol corridors and eject disruptive pupils from lessons . ‘At the heart of our reforms, we want to give head teachers the freedom to make the decisions that will improve standards in their school - and this is a perfect example.’ The ex-naval staff were brought in by Dame Sharon after she became the academy’ s first head five years ago. The school had long been in the doldrums in its previous incarnation - St Luke’ s Church of England Secondary – regularly achieving some of the worst exam results in the country. Dame Sharon – ennobled in 2000 for turning round struggling schools – began by tackling poor behaviour and attendance. This included drawing on Portsmouth’s naval links to build a team of school pastoral support workers. Their responsibilities included driving a school car to the homes of youngsters who had failed to turn up for classes – assuming no good reason had been given – and insisting they get out of bed and come to school. Prime Minister David Cameron accompanied by education secretary Nicky Morgan are met by head girl Brittanni Carvell, 15, and deputy head boy George Carnell, 15 . They also checked behaviour in corridors and removed pupils from lessons if they were seriously misbehaving. Another of their key roles was standing at the school gates and ensuring pupils were behaving well before entering the premises. ‘They were really useful members of staff because they were non-confrontational but have great personal presence and were very very good at being consistent about implementing our school policies,’ said Dame Sharon. ‘They also presented very positive male role models to the students and of course many of our students don’t have positive male role models in their lives.’ She added: ‘The Navy is a very valuable source of personnel. Most of them retire from the Navy in their early forties.’ Behaviour among pupils at St Luke’s had previously been so poor other schools had resisted using its pool facilities. ‘When I asked them why, they said that when they had used it in the past, the children used to throw chairs at them out of the third floor window and spit at them,’ said Dame Sharon. Following the introduction of a tough new disciplinary code backed up by the pastoral support workers, behaviour steadily improved. Charter Academy in Portsmouth deployed a team of three retired naval staff - including an ex-Royal Marine - to help enforce consistent discipline and provide boys with positive male role models . The school also emerged last year as the second most improved in the country and the best-performing in Portsmouth with 68 per cent of pupils achieving a set of five good GCSEs including English and maths. Other measures adopted by the academy - motto ‘work hard, be nice and no excuses’ – include a strict new dress code with traditional blazers and a house system. Teachers also drew on methods used in Singapore to boost maths teaching while primary school specialists were brought in to help pupils with very low reading ages. The techniques are among those that may be introduced more widely under Mr Cameron’s plan to give regional school commissioners strong powers to intervene directly in schools judged as failing by Ofsted. They will be able to sack heads and bring in new governing bodies as well as introducing new policies on classroom discipline, school uniform and homework. Schools may also become academies under the control of outside sponsors with a remit to drive up standards. But the reforms provoked consternation among heads who feared their jobs would become vulnerable. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘Here we see the first reverberations of UKIP on education policy. Today's announcement may make good politics to some but it makes lousy school improvement.’","Charter Academy in Portsmouth deployed a team of three retired naval staff .

"'You're too fat,' is something no woman should ever have to hear in the workplace. But for Ashley Graham, who has made a living for the past fifteen years modelling in the plus size clothes market, the insult is a regular occurrence. In the last 12 months, the 27-year-old from Nebraska has been elevated to the ranks of supermodel - gracing the cover of Elle earlier this year and featuring in both Love magazine and Teen Vogue this month. Supermodel Ashley Graham has launched a lingerie range (featured in pic) across Europe for plus-size women after being taunted all of her life over weight. The American is hoping to encourage women to embrace their curves . But that doesn't meant that the model is treated with kid gloves - her size means she is regularly subjected to a whole host of verbal abuse both outside and inside of the industry. She said: 'I have been in, I've been out, I've been too fat, I've been too thin, I've been too ethnic, I've been too white, I've had people tell me I'm too ugly. 'You really have to have thick skin to be (plus-size) in this industry.' But after decades of completely ignoring overweight women in fashion, film and music, Ashley believes that the tide is finally changing thanks to more and more women speaking out about their needs being ignored. She has just launched her own 19-piece lingerie range for plus-sized online retailer Navabi, with bras starting at 36DD and going up to 44E. With the average British woman in the UK now a size 16, Ashley hopes we are seeing an end to a clothing market focused solely on the perfect size ten. Ashley wants more fashion houses to use curvy models so that the general public can see themselves represented on TV and in magazines . She said: 'To see the changes in this industry is phenomenal and I'm excited to see where it's going. 'I really feel that curves are in and everything that I do on Instagram is #curvesarein. '(As plus size models) we go on the runway castings as much as we can for the high end designers that have never done plus-size before. 'And for the beauty adverts - just because I'm plus-size doesn't mean that I can't do a beauty or hair campaign. 'I was on the cover of Elle at the beginning of the year, I have done some editorial for Harpers Bazaar and I'm in Love Magazine and Miss Vogue right now, so it's happening. 'That's when you know the industry is changing.' Often, change starts with prominent public figures taking a stand and Ashley believes that British singer Adele is one of the stars that have really helped push the cause of curvy women in the western world. Although Ashley is larger than your average model, she maintains a healthy and active lifestyle . She said: 'With Adele, people aren't looking at her and saying that's a big girl who can sing, they're just saying that's Adele. 'But it's still something lingering over people's minds. 'Melissa McCartney is still only cast for big girl roles - I think that there is still that struggle in TV and film but she is still getting very high-profile roles.' However, there is still most of the work to be done,in the last two Fashion weeks - during February this year and the most recent one last month - Ashley maintains that all of the big fashion houses did not want to use anybody plus-size on their catwalks. She said: 'In February's fashion week and this fashion week, no high end designers wanted to use plus-size. 'There was a backlash - they saw us and they thought we were great, but they also said they were't ready to work with us yet. Over years of working in fashion, Ashley Graham has worked out how to dress to best flatter her figure - she enjoys both accentuating her hourglass figure (left) and wearing slouchy clothes (right) 'So while they see the curves and the plus-size, there aren't any high end designers putting curves on the catwalk yet. 'But things are going to be changing soon, the fact that they are open to seeing plus-size models at castings - that's a big deal.' Ashley is most concerned about pushing through a change because she believes is is something that normal women need to see - plus-size women being admired and welcomed by the media and fashion - in order to feel good about themselves. She said: 'I think seeing plus-size women on catwalks gives normal women confidence by knowing that there are actually people their size. 'They want to see themselves in the magazine - whether they are 13 or 45, they want to see someone representing them on a billboard, in a magazine or in a campaign.

Ashley Graham for Navabi  pants collection, each £17 . 'It's important for women to see body diversity in the community reflected in the media and you can tell it's wanted.' 'I have talked to multiple girls in different high schools with some other plus-size models, I also just went to a weight loss camp in upstate New York and it was really interesting because there were girls from a US size six (UK 10) and some as a US size 22 (UK 26). 'These girls couldn't believe that there were these models who were plus-size, who were excited about their curves and who were in the media. 'They don't know that it exists and they were excited and they said to us, 'Thank you for making me feel so incredible about my body. 'I don't have role models like this but you have created one for me.' Dress for your body type - trends don't necessarily matter . Buy classic pieces that you can wear in five or six years time - your wardrobe will grow immensely . Be confident to show off your  hourglass figure . If you feel good in an outfit then it shows - Ashley would rather be half an hour late than not feel good in what she's wearing for the day . 'To have 13,14 and 15-year-old girls say this was so nice and it really makes me want to do something about the fashion industry.' And while Ashley is full of positivity about women embracing their bodies, the model maintains that she is extremely anti-overeating. Over the years, being a plus-size model has made her a figurehead for the anti-fat brigade, with people accusing her of making the world an unhealthier place by promoting curvy bodies. She said: 'I absolutely hate that. To the people who say I am pro-obesity, I laugh in their face. 'I am pro-health and I am pro-diversity. 'If you look on my Instagram page, you can see that I work out constantly and I have a workout video coming out that shows you how to work out and keep your curves. 'I work out three-four days a week but I can modify my eating to kind of what I want, I also like green juices and healthy salads. 'I just happen to be big boned and have an extra layer of meat on me.'

"Do you know your ‘if’ statements from your ‘for’ loops? If so, you might have a shot at the world’s first job advert written entirely in code. Created by London-based Woto, the advert is looking for a creative designer to join the company - but they’ll need to be adept at coding to apply. Scroll down for video . A new London-based website called Woto has a job listing written in code (shown). It claims to be the first ever advert for employment of this sort. Applicants will need to crack the programming language in order to apply. The move is designed to highlight the growing important of coding in the UK . According to the IB Times, the co-founder and CEO of Woto Ian Collins said a standard job advert would not have been good enough to ‘separate the wheat from the chaff’. Co-founder Ekin Caglar added: ‘As a company embracing the future, we want to employ young people who can “talk our talk” but also learn and develop at the same rate as the technology around us.’ Under the new curriculum, children aged five will have to recite poetry by heart, 11-year-olds will sit maths exams without calculators and teenagers will study at least two Shakespeare plays. Computer programming will be taught from five to 14, and foreign languages will be made compulsory at primary school. There will be a new emphasis on spelling and grammar, and history will focus on the story of Britain. The more traditional curriculum is the culmination of a four-year campaign started by Michael Gove. His successor Mrs Morgan has pledged to continue the drive. Part of the coded message reads: ‘Woto’s creators are after a savvy tech/digital intern, to help them make Woto whirl over the next few months. ‘The role would be a varied one and enable you to hone your skills in a number of areas, from copywriting to coding.’ And they add: 'We are expecting a Woto page from you with your application to this email.' Speaking to MailOnline, Sophie Kurta from Sense Communications, who is handling the launch of the site, said there was a possibility more such job listings may go live in future as it is a ‘fun way of doing job adverts.’ She explained that as coding in schools in the UK is becoming a bigger issue, with it now on the curriculum for primary and secondary school pupils, the advert was seen as a good way to keep up with the times. The advert is looking for a creative designer to join the company - but they’ll need to be adept at coding to apply (stock image shown). Computer programming will be taught from five to 14 in UK schools from this year . Woto, which launched earlier this month, is a platform for people to share content such as recipes and flat listings. It currently has a user base of 10,000, with the site set to ramp up its activity in the coming months. Mr Collins added to MailOnline that Woto was a website builder of sorts but with the ease and simplicity of social media. Anyone can sign up and create their own space by logging onto the site. 'You can use it when you want to produce a page but don't want the commitment of a blog,' he explains. 'If you wanted to complain about Ryanair, for example, where would you go to do that? 'You could use a website but would you want to do that?'","A new London-based website called Woto has a job listing written in code .

"Video footage of Syrian prisoner Abu Wa'el Dhiab, who has been held at Guantanamo Bay since 2002, will now be shown in court after challenges from his lawyers and news outlets . A federal judge has ordered the public release of 28 videotapes of a hunger-striking Guantanamo Bay prisoner being forcibly removed from his cell and force-fed. Lawyers for the prisoner, Abu Wa'el Dhiab, have challenged his treatment as abusive. Numerous news media outlets, including The Associated Press, had asked the court on June 20 to unseal the videotapes, which are classified 'secret.' U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler granted the news media's request, although Kessler said the tapes will remain sealed until some information on them is redacted. The material to be removed includes identifying information of everyone on the tapes except for the prisoner. She said faces other than Dhiab's will be obscured, as will voices and names. 'Protection of the identities of Guantanamo Bay staff is a legitimate goal,' Kessler wrote. 'Adequate protection can be provided by appropriate audio and visual edits, for example, blurring faces and identifying portions of uniforms, and blacking-out written materials on walls.' The government could appeal her ruling. Dhiab's lawyer, Jon Eisenberg, said that 'we are very gratified by this decision, which will enable the American people to see with their own eyes the sorts of abuses that are being heaped on these peacefully hunger-striking detainees.' 'Once the truth is fully brought to light, we believe these terrible practices will come to an end,' Eisenberg said. AP attorney David Schulz welcomed the decision, calling it 'a strong reaffirmation of the public's right to know what their government is up to.' Dhiab was told in the spring he would be resettled in Uruguay, along with five other Guantanamo prisoners. But as the months have dragged on and the transfer put on hold, his standoff with military officials has only deteriorated, at times turning violent. On Thursday, the judge rejected a request by the Obama administration to close a hearing into Dhiab's case scheduled for Monday. Dhiab, a Syrian prisoner, has been held at the Navy-run prison for terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, since August 2002. The hunger-striking detainee's lawyers claim he was removed from his cell and force fed. A file picture shows a chair in the facility that could have been used for those purposes . The Obama administration has been in court for months seeking to limit the amount of information released in Dhiab's case. 'The court is well aware, as the government has emphasized, that in no case involving Guantanamo Bay detainees has any court ordered disclosure of classified information over the government's opposition,' Kessler wrote in a 29-page opinion ordering release of the tapes. 'However - to be clear - that does not mean that in a given factual situation no court has the discretion to do so if warranted,' the judge added. Standard protocol at penal institutions nationwide is to videotape forcible cell extractions. What's unusual about these videotapes is that many of them include footage of force-feedings in addition to forcible cell extractions. AP attorney David Schulz called the decision 'a strong reaffirmation of the public's right to know what their government is up to.' Hunger strikes at Guantanamo Bay have been taking place since the early days of the island facility's use as a prison for terrorist suspects following the September 11 attacks. In early 2013, as many as 100 detainees began a hunger strike to protest their uncertain fate. The U.S. has long disclosed how many are refusing to eat and whether they meet military guidelines to be force fed. But late last year, the disclosure ended. A Navy spokesman said in December 2013 that peaceful protest was allowed but that reporting numbers to the public would no longer be done. Hunger strikes at Guantanamo Bay have been taking place since the early days of the island facility's use as a prison for terrorist suspects following the September 11 attacks (picture taken in 2006) The former Navy commander at Guantanamo Bay, Rear Adm. Richard Butler, said in a court declaration filed in July that even though the forced cell extraction videos are lawful, humane and appropriate, they 'are particularly susceptible to use as propaganda and to incite a public reaction because of their depiction of forcible ... guard interaction with detainees.' The videos that also contain footage of forced-feedings could be used 'to foment anti-American sentiment and inflame Muslim sensitivities as it depicts ... personnel providing medical care to a detainee while he is restrained,' Butler said in the declaration. Making public a video showing a detainee receiving medical care while restrained 'would exacerbate the world's perception of detainees in U.S. custody,' Butler added. 'Public release, in whole or in part, of videos showing forced cell extractions' or feedings would cause 'serious damage to national security.' In her ruling, Kessler disputed many of Butler's points. After viewing the government videos and analyzing Butler's arguments, she found that they were 'unacceptably vague, speculative, lack specificity or are just plain implausible,' she wrote. The government has already released substantial information relating to the feeding process, including the layout of and equipment in the feeding space. 'It strains credulity to conclude that release of these videos has a substantial probability of causing the harm the government predicts,' Kessler wrote. The government argues that releasing the videos would allow adversaries to reconstruct portions of the camp infrastructure, threatening the security of the camps. But the judge noted that much of that information already is in the public domain.","Footage of Abu Wa'el Dhiab's treatement will be played in court .

"A cute puppy suffering from bent legs has been cured simply by his owners taking him for twice-daily walks. Golden retriever Kobi first showed signs of wonky paws when he was just three-months-old. His owners Hannah Lilley and Adam Hazelwood, both 22, took him to a vet after becoming concerned about the shape of his legs. Golden retriever Kobi, who at three-month-old first showed signs of having wonky paws and bent wrists . Kobi, pictured before his treatment, which caused him to suffer from difficulty when walking . At first it was feared Kobi was suffering from irreparable bone damage. But after seeking a second opinion, vet Terry Dunne told the couple from Hinckley in Leicestershire that Kobi was suffering from carpal laxity syndrome. The syndrome causes dogs to have difficulty walking due to the wrist joints on their front legs being bent. But rather than have to undergo painful treatment, Mr Dunne told Kobi's owners all they had to do was give him as much exercise as he could handle. Miss Lilley said: 'Kobi had been just like a normal puppy at first but then we noticed his wrists were constantly bent. 'As a result we thought it would be best to give him a rest so as not to put any more pressure on him. But since being diagnosed with carpal laxity syndrome and exercising as much as he can, Kobi, pictured left with owner Hannah Lilley, has seen his wrists straighten out allowing him to run and walk like any other normal dog . 'When we went to see Terry, he told us to do exactly the opposite and take him for walks twice a day.' And once the couple started Kobi's new exercise regime, the results were almost instant. Miss Lilley added: 'Within a week, his wrists had straightened out and he was back to normal. 'Now we've got a problem - we can barely keep up with him.' Mr Dunne, the vet at Fairfield Veterinary Centre in Hinckley said: 'It is a common misconception to try and support the abnormal joints with dressings or casts. Kobi, now five months, enjoying a run in the park now that his front paws have returned to normal . Owners Hannah Lilley and partner Adam Hazelwood, who say they can barely keep up with their pet now he has been cured . 'This has exactly the wrong effect - by protecting the joint in this way only makes it weaker. 'In order for a joint to be restored to good health it must be kept mobile and exercised providing the opportunity for the muscles, tendons and ligaments to develop and mature.' Now, at five-months-old, Kobi is undergoing standard training, but Miss Lilley, who is an occupational therapist, hopes he will become an assistance dog to help people with brain injuries. Many dogs who receive a diagnosis of carpal laxity syndrome do go on to lead a normal life after treatment . Carpal laxity syndrome is a condition that usually affects younger dogs, especially those of a larger breed. Dogs suffering from the condition have bent wrist joints, which cause them to experience difficulty and lameness when walking on their front legs, although it causes them no pain. It is unknown what causes the syndrome but experts suggest it could be due to a dog's bones growing faster than their tendons. Vets say treating the condition can sometimes be difficult as the cause of carpal laxity syndrome is unknown. However, most suggest that a combination of a healthy diet and plenty of exercise is enough to reverse the effects. Once treatment for dogs does begin, the recovery rate is fast and high and most dogs go on to lead a normal life .","Golden retriever Kobi first showed signs of bent paws at three-months-old .

"Apple’s HealthKit app is designed to help you get the most out of life by improving your well-being and fitness. But could it also be used to predict when you’ll die? That’s what a new app called Deadline is claiming, saying the tech can be used to predict exactly when you’ll kick the bucket. The morbid app uses a variety of data including your blood pressure, height and sleep pattern to come up with the prediction that is apparently accurate to the second. An app created for California-based Apple's iOS predicts when you'll die. Called Deadline (pictured) It apparently uses Apple's new HealthKit technology to give you a 'ticker' ‘You're going to die. Sorry, we all do eventually,’  company Gist LLC writes on their iTunes page. The app costs £0.69 ($0.99) and is available now for Apple devices with iOS 8 or later. First your heart stomps pumping, so the flow of blood around your body stops, according to the American Chemical Society. This causes the blood to coagulate, forming clots and becoming thick and lumping. Your muscles then stiffen in a process known as rigor mortis, which also stops you breathing and means no oxygen gets to your cells. Your cells thus too begin to die, releasing enzymes that make your body very welcoming to bacteria and fungi. These decompose and putrify your body and ultimately, within a year or so, most of the flesh on your body will have decomposed leaving just your bones behind. ‘But, what if you knew the date of your death? ‘Would it motivate you to be healthier?’ The company claims to use HealthKit data, in addition to a few questions about your life style, to give you an estimated time of death. It pulls in a variety of information and tells you how long you’ve got to live in years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds. Living a healthier lifestyle will apparently give you a longer life expectancy in the app. And with Apple’s new notification system for iOS 8.1 the app will keep your ‘ticker’ updated on your home screen. However, according to Gizmodo the app’s claims of being accurate are not entirely true, instead being just ‘a genetic algorithm that forecasts your death’. The ticker (left) shows you the time down to the second that you'll die. Exercising more and improving your health (right) increases life expectancy. However some have said the app just uses a random algorithm . Earlier this week a video from the American Chemical Society talked through the exact process of how you die. From your bodily functions shutting down to the process of embalming to make you presentable for your funeral, all of the gruesome details were discussed. When blood stops circulating your cells begin to die. This makes your body bacteria and fungi start to decompose your body. To stop this scientists can pump you full of chemicals - called embalming. This keep you presentable for about a week such as for your funeral. But ultimately your body will decompose to bones in a year or so.","App created for California-based Apple's iOS predicts when you'll die .

"Raise a glass and say cheers to pubs - for according to scientists the local is worth up to £120,000-a-year to its community, it was revealed yesterday. An 18-month academic study into Britain's rural pubs found they offer economic, social and other benefits to communities that would probably not be replaced if they were to close. Some of that is social, like providing a place to meet for local people, many of them old or single who may not mix with their neighbours if it wasn't for a friendly inn nearby. An 18-month academic study into Britain's rural pubs found they offer economic, social and other benefits to communities that would probably not be replaced if they were to close (File photo) But also it is economic, said Dr Ignazio Cabra of Northumbria University's Newcastle Business School who was given a £7,700 grant to go round community pubs across the UK. He found the value of a pub to a rural community was equal to between £80,000 and £120,000. This includes business connections, such as sourcing local produce for food and drink, to giving work to locals, holding events and bringing communities together. It also, in many areas, includes the pub becoming the replacement for the post office, village shop and other services that have been closed down nearby, he said. The research is good news for an industry struggling against sky high tax on alcohol and supermarket price wars which has seen many replace a night at the pub with drinking at home. But Dr Cabra said: ""Pubs are not just businesses they are assets. The research is good news for an industry struggling against sky high tax on alcohol and supermarket price wars which has seen many replace a night at the pub with drinking at home (File photo) ""In many villages there is no shop, no post office, no local traders but there is still a pub and that pub embodies all that those those services provided to the community. ""If you lose a pub, you lose much more than a building and once that pub is gone it will never come back."" This English gentleman is helping to keep pubs in business . The study was conducted in partnership with the Leeds University Business School and examined rural pubs in 2,800 parishes with a population of less than 3,000 and situated at least five miles from the nearest town. Pro-pub campaigners hope the report can be used to influence government policy around planning applications regarding pubs, where many are being turned into other uses. John Longden of campaign group Pub is the Hub said: ""In rural areas, pubs act as essential melting pots for bringing the community together from all walks of life.

"A nurse who has been quarantined despite having no Ebola symptoms declared today that she will not be bullied by 'appalling' confinement rules and plans to fight for her freedom if restrictions are not lifted by Thursday. Kaci Hickox, 33, said her lawyer will go to court in Maine on Thursday to demand that authorities lift the 21-day quarantine placed on her at her Fort Kent home as she is in 'perfectly good health'. She told Today: 'I don’t plan on sticking to the guidelines. I am not going to sit around and be bullied by politicians and forced to stay in my home when I am not a risk to the American public.' Miss Hickox, who treated Ebola sufferers in Sierra Leone with Doctors Without Borders for four weeks, was the first person forced into New Jersey's mandatory quarantine after arriving at Newark Airport on Friday with a fever. Scroll down for video . Fighting for her freedom: Doctors Without Borders nurse Kaci Hickox, 33, (pictured today at her home in Fort Kent, Maine) is demanding to have a quarantine on her lifted because she is 'perfectly healthy' The Doctors Without Borders nurse was self-monitoring at her home in Fort Kent, Maine on Wednesday but planned to fight her mandatory quarantine by the Maine state authorities on Thursday . Nurse Hickox, sleeping at her home in Maine where she is currently under quarantine by the state authorities, is due to launch a court battle on Thursday for her freedom . The nurse insisted today that her elevated temperature of 101F  - which is considered an Ebola symptom - was caused by a faulty thermometer and the chaos at Newark-Liberty Airport on Friday. She said: 'This whole time I have been symptom-free. I believe the forehead scanner was inaccurate. My temperature was normal when taken by oral thermometer.' She said that she understood the Ebola fears among the  public but added: 'The issue at Newark Airport is different - I saw complete disorganization, no leadership and if you're going to put a policy like that in place that impedes on my civil rights, you need to have it worked out before you start detaining me in an airport.' Miss Hickox appeared on the Today show via Skype today where she told host Matt Lauer that she was back at her house in Fort Kent, Maine. She said that she was appalled by mandatory quarantine policies, adding: 'They are not based on science or evidence. Hickox, who spent the weekend in a quarantine tent in New Jersey, said she never had Ebola symptoms and her temperature was normal on an oral thermometer reading - despite showing 101F on a forehead scanner . 'If the restrictions by Maine are not lifted by Thursday morning, I will go to court to get my freedom.' Her lawyer, civil rights attorney Norman Siegel, told Today that there was absolutely no basis in medical science to quarantine his client at this time. The 33-year-old nurse believes authorities should 'stick to the facts of science' and follow the reasonable steps of an organization like Doctors Without Borders who recommend 'self-monitoring twice a day and if you develop symptoms then you need to be tested'. Nurse Kaci Hickox was held for four days in a quarantine tent at University Hospital in New Jersey after showing a temperature of 101F at Newark Airport on arrival from Sierra Leone . Miss Hickox said: 'I truly believe that this policy is not scientifically or constitutionally just. I am not a risk to the American public. 'Of course I do understand that it has created a lot of fear but we have to make policies based on evidence. She added: 'We need more education about the disease and should not be taking these mixes messages from politicians. 'Currently, I am the one that's suffering.' The nurse plans to return to West Africa in the future to help in the fight against Ebola. Hickox will abide by all the self-monitoring requirements of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state of Maine, her second attorney, Steven Hyman, said. On Monday, Hickox traveled from New Jersey to Maine, where her boyfriend is a senior nursing student at the University of Maine at Fort Kent. Her boyfriend has decided to spend time with her during the quarantine period, officials said on Tuesday. If Hickox were to show Ebola symptoms, then her boyfriend and any others who had contact with her also would be subject to quarantine, Maine health officials said. Maine health officials said on Tuesday that they're prepared to legally enforce the state's ‘voluntary’ quarantine on health care workers who've treated Ebola patients. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew said her department and the attorney general's office were prepared to take legal steps to enforce a quarantine if someone declines to cooperate but did not refer to Nurse Hickox specifically. Mayhew said: ''We do not want to have to legally enforce in-home quarantine. Quarantined nurse Kaci Hickox pictured with the prominent New York civil rights attorney Norman Siegel, seated, at the isolation tent at University Hospital in Newark on Sunday . Ms Hickox did not have access to a flushable toilet and was forced to use a port-a-potty in her isolation tent at the New Jersey hospital over the weekend . 'We're confident that selfless health workers who were brave enough to care for Ebola patients in a foreign country will be willing to take reasonable steps to protect residents of their own country. 'However we are willing to pursue legal authority if necessary to ensure risk is minimized for Mainers.' At present, Maine quarantines 'high-risk' people who have had contact with Ebola patients while others who have been to the Ebola 'hot zone' countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, will be monitored. Ebola has infected more than 10,000 people and killed about half of them, the vast majority in the West African region. There have been some cases outside the worst-hit countries, including in the United States. Governor Chris Christie (pictured left) said his mandatory quarantine policy for New Jersey will not change as President Obama said on Tuesday that America is not 'defined by fear' Both New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have been sharply criticized for ordering mandatory quarantines. Governor Christie defended his policy on the Today show on Tuesday, saying that the nurse had presented at the airport with a fever after having direct contact with Ebola patients. Christie said: 'I am going to be on the right side of science and public opinion, ultimately.' He added that his policy will not change. President Obama appeared to condemn Governor Christie in a speech on Tuesday on the lawn of the White House. 'America in the end is not defined by fear – that's not who we are,' President Obama said, calling for 'new monitoring and movement guidance that is sensible'.

"He won the Nobel Prize for physics. But Brian Schmidt received no special treatment from the TSA when he tried to take the 24-carat pure gold medal through airport security in Fargo, Nebraska. He was awarded the prize, made from $10,000 of gold, for co-discovering that the expansion of the universe was accelerating - a finding that has transformed our understanding of the solar system. As he tried to take it to show his grandmother, however, the revered physicist was stopped and interrogated. Travel issues: Brian Schmidt, pictured receiving the Nobel Prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in 2011, revealed he was interrogated at airport security after taking his gold medal to show his grandma in Nebraska . 'It's a large gold medal': The guards were baffled by the gong which went off when Schmidt put his bag through . 'There are a couple of bizarre things that happen,' Schmidt, 47, told an audience in New York last month. 'One of the things you get when you win a Nobel Prize is, well, a Nobel Prize. 'It's about that big, that thick [he mimes a disk roughly the size of an Olympic medal], weighs a half a pound, and it's made of gold. 'When I won this, my grandma, who lives in Fargo, North Dakota, wanted to see it. 'I was coming around so I decided I'd bring my Nobel Prize. 'You would think that carrying around a Nobel Prize would be uneventful, and it was uneventful, until I tried to leave Fargo with it, and went through the X-ray machine. 'I could see they were puzzled. It was in my laptop bag. It's made of gold, so it absorbs all the X-rays—it's completely black. And they had never seen anything completely black. Shock: Schmidt also revealed he was cooking dinner when, without warning, he was called with the news . No special treatment: TSA security guards (stock image) put Schmidt through intensive questioning . 'They're like, ""Sir, there's something in your bag."" 'I said, ""Yes, I think it's this box."" 'They said, ""What's in the box?"" 'I said, ""a large gold medal,"" as one does. 'So they opened it up and they said, ""What's it made out of?"" 'I said, ""gold."" 'And they're like, ""Uhhhh. Who gave this to you?"" '""The King of Sweden"". Life-changing: The 47-year-old physicist co-discovered that the universe's expansion rate  was accelerating . '""Why did he give this to you?""' '""Because I helped discover the expansion rate of the universe was accelerating."" At which point, they were beginning to lose their sense of humor. 'I explained to them it was a Nobel Prize, and their main question was, ""Why were you in Fargo?""' Schmidt, a Harvard graduate who lectures at the Australian National University, described the encounter as he joined physicists celebrating the construction of one of the largest observatories in the world, the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), due to open in 2020 in Chile. He also revealed he was cooking dinner when, without warning, he received a call saying he had won the prize. 'It’s not like you get advanced warning, he said.

"A woman sustained 90 per cent burns after setting herself on fire outside the Bulgarian president's office in the capital of Sofia. Bystanders rushed to put out the fire after the 38-year-old set herself alight in the street, saving her life. The woman is now in critical condition after the incident, which coincided with President Rosen Plevneliev discussing the formation of a new government following an inconclusive election last month. Bystanders attempt to put out flames engulfing a 38-year-old woman after she set herself on fire in front of the Bulgarian presidency building in Sofia . According to witnesses, the woman stepped out of a car in front of the building and set herself alight after pouring a flammable liquid over her hair and body. 'The woman, a 38-year-old, was taken to hospital. She is in very serious condition,' an interior ministry spokeswoman said. A doctor at an emergency hospital in Sofia told reporters the woman, named locally as Lidia Petrova, had 90 per cent burns and remained in critical condition. The doctor said she has a record of mental illness, but did not elaborate. Serious injury: It is not yet known why the woman, named locally as Lidia Petrova, set herself on fire . Fire: The woman is now in critical condition in the hospital, after sustaining burns on 90 per cent of her body . Distress: Doctors in Sofia later told local media that the woman had a history of mental illness . The incident took place as President Plevneliev was discussing forming a government following the inconclusive October 5 snap poll in Bulgaria, the poorest country in the European Union. The centre-right GERB party won the vote, but lacks a majority, and is currently holding talks to form a minority government and secure outside support from a nationalist party and a centre-left faction. In the first months of 2013, Bulgaria was rocked by demonstrations which brought down the centre-right GERB government. The woman's motives remain unclear, but her action comes after seven people set themselves on fire across the country in the spring of 2013 in protest against low living standards and suspected corruption among Bulgaria's political elite.","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"A suspect in the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl who was cleared for release by a Pakistani court last week was instead taken into custody, it has emerged. On Friday, an anti-terrorist court said there was not enough evidence to hold Qari Hashim Ali, who had been detained in the Hyderabad central jail since August 2005 over the 2002 killing. But rather than being released, he was taken back into custody, a government official told NBC. 'According to intelligence and police assessments, the accused is still a threat to peace,' Niaz Ali Abbasi, the Home Secretary of Sindh province, told the channel. 'We feel that the people must be protected from this man.' Killed: Daniel Pearl, pictured in an image sent to  media organizations by his kidnappers, was beheaded in 2002. One of the suspects in his death was cleared for release last week but was taken back into custody . Pearl, the South Asia bureau chief at the Wall Street Journal, vanished in Karachi in January 2002. A month later authorities received video footage of him being beheaded. His decapitated body was found in a shallow grave in May 2002. Hashim had been apprehended for arranging a meeting between Pearl and another of the men accused in the killing. On Friday, court official Abdul Samih told the BBC that Justice Abdul Ghafoor Memon had ordered for Hashim to be released immediately and his attorneys had expressed their relief, saying there had not been any evidence to hold him. After he remained in custody, government officials did not expand on why they believed he still posed a threat. The mastermind behind the killing, British-born Pakistani Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, was sentenced to death in 2002 and remains in the Hyderabad Central jail in Sindh province. Held: Qari Hashim Ali was cleared to leave the central jail Hyderabad on Friday - but is still in custody . Tragic: Pearl was captured and beheaded as he researched militant groups in Karachi. One of the men accused of his death, Omar Sheikh (pictured right om 2002) has been sentenced to death . Earlier this year, Sheikh tried to hang himself in prison, AFP reported. His co-accused, Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem and Sheikh Adil, were given life sentences. Another suspect, Saud Memon, who was accused of providing the place where Pearl was held before his death, died in mysterious circumstances in May 2007. Daniel Pearl was 38 when he died. He had been investigating militant groups in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks when he was kidnapped in Karachi in January, 2002. Days before his abduction, Pearl had learned that his wife Mariane was expecting a baby boy. After he vanished, Mariane remained in Pakistan and campaigned for her husband's release throughout his capture. But on February 21, 2002, a shocking video of his killing was delivered to U.S. officials in Pakistan and his remains were found in a shallow grave on Karachi's outskirts three months later. His son was born four months after he died.","Qari Hashim walked free from a Hyderabad jail on Friday after an anti-terrorism court said there was not enough evidence to hold him .

"Grinning with their friends as schoolboys, these are two of the men suspected of plotting to bring terror to British streets. Just three years ago Tarik Hassane and Gusai Abuzeid were ‘happy-go-lucky’ best friends at Westminster City School. Now the 21-year-olds are sitting in a high security police cell suspected of links to a violent conspiracy inspired by Islamic State fanatics. Scroll down for video . Suspects: Scotland Yard has warned Tarik Hassane (top left), Gusai Abuzeid (bottom left), Rawan Kheder (right) and two other men that they face up to a week behind bars after they were held in a dramatic series of raids . Scotland Yard has warned the men – and three others – that they face up to a week behind bars after they were held in a dramatic series of raids. Senior sources said they were arrested in a bid to disrupt a ‘significant’ plot which threatened an unknown target in the capital. But last night their families and friends questioned whether they could really be linked to a violent fundamentalist conspiracy. Neighbours said a third suspect, Rawan Kheder, 20, is an Iraqi Kurd, a group which is locked in bitter fighting with Islamic State militants. They described the student – seen here dressed in a dinner suit in a picture taken from his Facebook page – as a polite and hard-working young man. In March, he organised an event called ‘Discover Islam’ at Nottingham University. The family of the fourth suspect, who cannot be identified, live in a council flat in central London. Education: Just three years ago Hassane and Abuzeid were 'happy-go-lucky' best friends at Westminster City School (pictured). Now the 21-year-olds are sitting in a high security police cell . More than 48 hours after their arrest, the Daily Mail can reveal police are probing whether the men are linked to terrorist Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary – better known as the ‘hip-hop jihadi’. The extremist is several years older than the suspects but moved in the same West London circles. 'Hip-hop jihadi': Police are probing whether the men are linked to terrorist Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary (above) Several close friends of those in custody have even appeared in his amateur music videos filmed on the streets of Maida Vale and Ladbroke Grove. Abdel Bary, 24, abandoned a fledgling career as a rapper to travel to Syria and join militants fighting the Assad regime. At one stage the extremist, whose father was a lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, was incorrectly suspected of being Islamic State hostage murderer Jihadi John. He has been outspoken on social networking sites, posing for macabre photographs with guns and a severed head. Last night, Scotland Yard revealed a fifth man was arrested as part of the terror swoop on Tuesday but his detention was kept secret for ‘operational reasons’. The suspect, whose identity cannot be revealed, is also understood to be a former pupil of Westminster City School. It recently emerged Abuzeid appeared in a short film as part of an A-level media studies project, in which he was ‘kidnapped’. In the video the main character, played by Abuzeid, can be seen running through the school before two men confront and kidnap him. They are then seen interrogating him about the location of a ‘file’. Neighbours of Abuzeid, who lives in a modern apartment block in Marylebone, were shocked at his arrest. One woman said: ‘There was nothing to say he was really religious, he wore jeans, trainers just like any Brit. I’ve lived next door to his family for a year-and-a-half... they are very well-to-do.’ Home: Neighbours of Abuzeid, who lives in this modern apartment block in Marylebone, were shocked at his arrest . Probe: Neighbours said forensic teams have 'pulled up' the floors of two flats occupied by Hassane's aunt and uncle on the Princess Alice estate (pictured), west London, in their search for clues . Kheder’s family home in Chelsea, west London, was raided by ‘dozens’ of armed police on Tuesday morning, according to neighbours. They said his father runs a plumbing firm and that Kheder is a martial arts fan and keen follower of Arsenal FC. Nacer Dahmas, 58, said: ‘They have lived here for at least 20 years and they are the most wonderfully kind family. All the neighbours say the same thing. He never mentioned politics. ‘He was a practising Muslim but never seemed like a fanatic. I think the family are Iraqi Kurds. They were a hard working moderate family. ‘His older brother has finished university and his older sister is married with a little child. I think she might be a solicitor.’ Friends of Hassane, whose Moroccan mother works at a school, have defended him after it emerged he wrote ‘I smell war’ on Twitter just hours before he was arrested. Launching a ‘Justice for Tarik’ campaign, many said it simply referred to a ‘bunch of rowdy girls’ who were bickering on the social networking site. Neighbours said forensic teams have ‘pulled up’ the floors of two flats occupied by his aunt and uncle on the Princess Alice estate, west London, in their search for clues. The suspects could remain in custody for up to 14 days. A magistrate has already granted an extension until next Tuesday. They were held on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, which carries a life sentence if they are convicted.

"A barman was hit in the face with a beer bottle by a drunken woman, leaving a jagged scar across his forehead like the one sported by Harry Potter. Jordan Sedgwick, 22, was trying to help eject Nicole Howe from a nightclub in Accrington, Lancashire, when the 21-year-old woman began throwing bottles at him. One struck him in the head and as Mr Sedgwick tried to escape with blood pouring from a head wound, Howe attempted to get over the bar at the Voodoo Club so she could scratch and kick him. Attacked: Jordan Sedgwick (left, pictured before the attack), 22, was trying to help eject Nicole Howe (right) from a nightclub in Accrington, Lancashire, when the 21-year-old woman began throwing bottles at him . When police arrived, Howe defiantly told a sergeant: ‘I would do it again. I bottled him because he gave my brother verbals and you don’t do that.’ The cut to Mr Sedgwick’s forehead needed nine stitches. He told police his injury has been likened to the one sported by Potter, following Lord Voldemort’s failed murder attempt on the fictional wizard. Mr Sedgwick is still working behind the bar but has lost so much confidence he no longer wants to progress to management and suffers nightmares. After the attack, Howe was dragged kicking and screaming from the club and kicked a sergeant repeatedly in the face as she was being placed in patrol car. Referring to a previous conviction in which she kicked a policeman in the groin, Howe boasted: ‘That’s two police assaults now I have done. Can’t assault enough of you.’ But at Burnley Crown Court, Howe was spared jail after offering ‘genuine remorse’ over her violent conduct and because she had been ‘lightly convicted.’ Howe attempted to get over the bar at the Voodoo Club (above) in Accrington so she could scratch and kick him . Lisa Worsley, prosecuting, said the incident occurred on April 13 when Howe was being ejected after aggressive behaviour at the bar. She went back in, threw two bottles and then approached the victim again and began kicking and scratching at him. The first bottle cut Mr Sedgwick’s head, causing a 1.2in (3cm) cut. Scar: Mr Sedgwick told police his injury has been likened to the one sported by Harry Potter (pictured) Howe was picked up by a doorman and thrown out. Miss Worsley said: ‘She was put in the police vehicle, while the officer carried out inquiries. ‘The officer was concerned at Howe’s behaviour in the rear passenger seat as she was kicking out forcefully at the window, causing the glass to bulge outwards. ‘The sergeant opened the door and tried to pile on top of the defendant to stop her kicking, but Howe managed to get her legs in the air, pulled them back and kicked the officer three or four times in the face. The officer suffered reddening and slight discomfort to her face. The prosecutor said: ‘Mr Sedgwick says he lost confidence after the attack. He was still working at the bar, but would leave if he could afford it. He had had ambitions to progress to management, but no longer wanted to do that. 'He was extremely shaken up by what happened, had had nightmares and had to take leave from his full-time job because the injury was noticeable and he felt everybody was staring at him and making a judgement. ‘The remaining scar has affected his confidence and he had had to grow his hair to conceal it. He says the scar has been compared to that of Harry Potter and he’s suffered some torment as a result of that.’ Howe who admitted wounding was sentenced to 13 months in prison, suspended for two years, with 12 months’ supervision, 180 hours unpaid work and the Specified Activity Requirement for alcohol treatment. In 2011, Howe left a policeman in agony when she kicked him in the groin when he was called to eject her from a Salvation Army Hostel for being drunk. Hearing:  Howe was spared jail at Burnley Crown Court (above) after offering 'genuine remorse' over the attack . On that occasion she was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay the officer £50 compensation after claiming she could remember nothing of the incident. She also had a caution for being drunk and disorderly in a separate incident. Sara Dodd, defending, said: ‘The night of this incident was the anniversary of her deceased father’s birthday. It’s not an excuse, but it may explain the condition she got herself into. ‘Her two great ambitions in life are to have work and to have a home. Custody would inevitably mean the loss of both of these.’ Miss Dodd told the hearing there had been no further incidents of drunkenness or drunken violence in the six months since, and that Howe’s remorse was genuine. She added: ‘There is a clear link between alcohol use and her offending behaviour.’ The judge Mr Recorder Roger Farley, QC, told Howe: ‘What you did, you know, was completely disgraceful. You have a previous conviction for assaulting a police officer and apparently took some delight in doing so.’ The judge added that he could suspend the sentence because the defendant was ‘lightly convicted’ and because of her guilty pleas.","Jordan Sedgwick was trying to help eject Nicole Howe from a nightclub .

"What do a bar and a county jail have in common? Apparently a lot to one highly intoxicated Michigan woman who mistook the Van Buren County Jail for a bar, police say. Authorities say the 39-year-old woman smelled of alcohol and appeared intoxicated when she pulled into the jail's parking lot in Paw Paw at 2am. The woman was reportedly trying to pick up her boyfriend at a bar.

Mistaken: The woman admitted to police that she had just come from a local bar and thought she had arrived at another one but instead found herself at the sheriff's office . The department said that Deputy Robert Miersma spotted the woman and a breath test showed that the woman's blood alcohol level was more than twice the state's legal limit of 0.8 percent. The woman's level was 0.17 percent, according to police. The woman admitted to police that she had just come from a local bar and thought she had arrived at another bar.

"Perhaps it was the title that should have been the giveaway for TV presenter Andrea McLean. For when she was offered a leading role in a British gangster flick, it was called A Landscape Of Lies. The Loose Women star was filmed in intimate clinches as she played a bisexual therapist in what its makers claimed was a movie portraying a ‘seedy world of power, lies, and betrayal’. Scroll down to see the 'bogus film' trailer . Jailed: Former property developer Bassar Al-Issa (right) and film producer Aoife Madden (left) were part of the gang who pretended to be making a Hollywood blockbuster to claim £2.8million in VAT and film tax credits . 'Entirely bogus film project': Loose Women presenter Andrea McLean (left) was one of the A-listers roped into starring in the fake thriller (pictured in a fake promotional video as a bisexual therapist) Andrea McLean declined to comment after the hearing . But Miss McLean, 43, soon discovered . it was the film producers who were dealing in lies and betrayal. For the . four men and a woman behind the project were involved in a . sophisticated scam to cheat the taxman. They had begun by pretending to be . making a blockbuster with the similar title, A Landscape Of Lives. They . claimed this film would star Hollywood A-listers such as Jeremy Irons, . as well as his wife Sinead Cusack and Hollyoaks star Christina Bailey, . and had a £20million budget . But it was all a sham to allow the . gang to make out the venture had lost most of the money they had . ‘invested’, so they could claim £2.7million in tax rebates under a . scheme designed to boost the film industry. Yesterday a judge said the scam exposed the ‘naievety’ of such rebate schemes. The gang wrote fake scripts and crafted counterfeit documents to give their plan a veneer of respectability. They raked in almost £1million in fraudulently claimed cash in the 12 months until April 2011. But tax officials became suspicious – . and discovered the film company’s offices in fashionable Harley Street, . London, consisted of a single empty room. Its ‘studio’ was the flat of one of the gang, where they had managed to produce just eight minutes of poor quality footage. But while on bail after they were . arrested on suspicion of fraud, the gang hatched a plot to convince . investigators the project did exist, and made A Landscape Of Lies – with . a budget of less than £90,000. Miss McLean was unwittingly roped in to . play Dr Audrey Grey. Marc Bannerman, who played Gianni di Marco in EastEnders, was also approached. The gang even created a website which . boasted: ‘This gritty British drama is a complex exploration of lives . that will draw you into their seedy world of power, lies, and betrayal. ‘The dark themes are subtly . illuminated by the characters’ poignant stories. The storyline . challenges people’s notions of what’s right and what’s wrong.’ Film tax scam: The five fraudsters convinced HMRC that Madden's production company Evolved Pictures had secured £19.6million in financial backing from a Jordanian company for gangster film A Landscape of Lies . Andrea McLean starred as bisexual therapist Dr Audrey Grey in the film A Landscape of Lies . Charged: Pakistani national Tariq Hassan was convicted of one charge of conspiracy to cheat the revenue in relation to film tax credits and jailed for four years . Ironically, A Landscape Of Lies won an . award at the 2012 Las Vegas Film Festival. But by then the scam had . collapsed completely after tax officials began exmaining the books. Yesterday, the five fraudsters were . jailed at Southwark crown court, with Judge Juliet May saying she could . not decide whether they were ‘fantasists’ or were laughing at the . ‘naivety’ of a system designed to encourage home-grown filmmakers.

London, he dreamt up the scheme while studying finance at the University . of East London. He transferred a substantial chunk of the illicit . profits to Jordan, where he has a home and businesses. It has not been . recovered. Aoife Madden, 31, an actress, film producer and former drama teacher, was jailed for four years and eight months. Her home was used to shoot the few . scenes of the original movie that were filmed and she hand-delivered a . DVD to officials to try to prove it existed. She was also a student at the . University of East London, where another conspirator, Tariq Hassan, 51, . taught Al-Issa. Hassan, of Loughton, Essex was jailed for four years. Architect Ian Sherwood, 53, from . Manchester, was jailed for three and a half years, while Jordanian . businessman Osama Al-Baghdady, 50, from Manchester, was jailed for four . years.

A Virgin aircraft that was preparing to land at Gold Coast Airport in Queensland was seen making a sharp turn at the last second just as a second aircraft appeared to be in its flight path at about 9.15am.

It looked like if the Virgin plane had not pulled out there could have been a big problem,' one beach-goer said. 'They were very close to each other.' The huge plane then flew around in a wide arc before attempting a second landing. It landed safely at the airport just after a Qantas plane. Despite landing at the airport safely shortly afterwards, a Virgin spokesperson confirmed the plane had been directed to perform a 'go around procedure' due to another plane's departure being delayed .
