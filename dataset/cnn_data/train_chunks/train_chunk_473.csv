Paramedics kept Louise Lewis (pictured) waiting for 45 minutes while she suffered a heart attack... even though she lives next to an ambulance station . A mother suffering a heart attack was kept waiting for 45 minutes by paramedics even though she lives just two doors away from an ambulance station. Health chiefs were today investigating after Louise Lewis, 36, called 999 when she was struck down with stabbing chest pains. An operator told the mother-of-two, from Llanelli, South Wales, that an ambulance was on its way but couldn’t say how long it would take. Ms Lewis looked out of her window to see two ambulances parked up in the depot in the same street. But she was too weak to walk the 100 yards to knock on the ambulance crews' doors for help. Desperate, Ms Lewis phoned again after 45 minutes and was told to keep waiting. She then asked a friend to drive her to hospital where doctors found she had suffered a massive heart attack. Ms Lewis said: 'I feel like I’m lucky to be alive, I could have died waiting for an ambulance to arrive. 'It’s ridiculous - I was looking out of my window and I could see two ambulances parked up at the station in my street.

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 07:53 EST, 15 February 2012 . The mother of EastEnders star Steve McFadden's child was arrested yesterday after the soap actor claimed she attacked him in his car. McFadden reported former lover Rachel Sidwell, 45, to police and is said to have scratches on his back and shoulders following the alleged assault. Skin specialist Dr Sidwell, who has a two-year-old daughter Amelie Tinkerbell with the 52-year-old actor, was arrested at 7.30am yesterday and spent Valentine's Day in custody. Happier times: McFadden and his now ex-lover Rachel Sidwell, pictured in 2009 met on the school run and had a year-long relationship . Three Met Police officers arrested Dr Sidwell at the £1m home she shares with her husband and children. McFadden, who plays hard man Phil Mitchell in the BBC soap, is said to have met Dr Sidwell in 2008 on the school run. She left her husband, who is a surgeon, and three children within weeks of meeting the soap actor and fell pregnant during their year together. However, the pair were involved in a series of . spats and the relationship ended in September 2009, with Dr Sidwell declaring that TV hardman McFadden 'could not be trusted'. Dr Sidwell returned to the family home after the split. The pair, who both have three children from previous relationships, split in 2009. They have a two-year-old daughter, Amelie Tinkerbell, together . Veteran: Steve McFadden, 52, has played Phil Mitchell in EastEnders since 1990 . Just weeks later McFadden was arrested after an allegation of harassment, thought to have been made by Dr Sidwell. The case was dropped, however. McFadden also has a son Matt, 24, with childhood sweetheart Sue Marshall and two daughters with ex-girlfriend Angela Bostock. The veteran soap actor has played Phil Mitchell in EastEnders since 1990. A Met Police spokesperson confirmed a man in his 50s had reported an alleged attack on Sunday. The spokesperson said yesterday: 'This morning, a woman in her 40s was arrested in connection with the investigation.'","Alleged assault on soap actor saw his ex spend Valentine's Day in custody .

When Facebook suggested to Ellenora Fulk that she should befriend Teri Wyatt-O'Neill, she recognised someone in the other woman's profile picture. Even though Ms Fulk did not know Ms O'Neill, she noticed a picture of the stranger drinking champagne with her estranged husband - dressed in formal clothes and standing next to a wedding cake. When she confronted her husband, Alan O'Neill, he admitted that he had married Ms O'Neill despite having never divorced Ms Fulk. O'Neill - who formerly called himself Alan Fulk - now faces bigamy charges in Tacoma, Washington after Ms Fulk alerted authorities to his deception. Busted: When Ellenora Fulk saw this picture on Teri Wyatt-O'Neill's Facebook page, she realised that the stranger was married to her husband, Alan O'Neill . According to charging documents filed on Thursday, he married Ms Fulk in 2001, moved out in 2009, changed his name and remarried without divorcing her. Ms Fulk first noticed O'Neill had moved on to another woman when Facebook suggested the friendship connection to Ms O'Neill under the 'People You May Know' feature. 'Wife number 1 went to wife number 2's page and saw a picture of her and her husband with a wedding cake,' Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said. Ms Fulk then called the defendant's mother. 'An hour later the defendant arrived at [Ms Fulk's] apartment, and she asked him several times if they were divorced,' court records show. 'The defendant said, ""No, we are still married.""' Wives: O'Neill first married Ms Fulk, left, then Ms O'Neill, right, but never divorced his first wife . Neither O'Neill nor Ms Fulk had filed for divorce, according to charging documents. The name change came in December, and later that month he married Ms O'Neill. O'Neill allegedly asked Ms Fulk not to tell anybody about his dual marriages and promised he would fix it, the documents state. But she alerted authorities anyway. 'Facebook is now some place where people discover things about each other that end up reporting that to law enforcement,' Mr Lindquist said. Technology: It was a Facebook friend suggestion which first unravelled the alleged deception . O'Neill was previously known as Alan Fulk. He has worked as a Pierce County corrections officer for five years, sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. He was placed on administrative leave after prosecutors charged him on Thursday. He could face up to a year in jail if convicted. O'Neill is free, but due in court later this month, which is standard procedure for non-violent crimes. 'About the only danger he would pose is marrying a third woman,' Mr Lindquist said.","Alan O'Neill's first wife found a picture of his wedding to second wife .

Tragic: Haley Verzani was fatally pinned to her bed when the 100-foot-tall fir tree, crashed down onto her house in the Northern California town of Arnold . An 8-year-old girl was killed in a freak accident on Sunday when a storm-weakened tree collapsed onto the home where she was in bed asleep, authorities said. Haley Verzani was fatally pinned to her bed when the 100-foot-tall fir tree, crashed down onto her house in the Northern California town of Arnold. The fir, which was three-feet in diameter fell across a creek during a night of unexpected heavy snow. The girl’s mother, Lindsey Jacoby, . and the mother’s boyfriend were inside the home at the time the tree . fell, they were able to make it out without being seriously hurt. The family told Fox 40 they noticed . the towering pine tree was leaning and looked like it was about to . fall, but they said it was growing on someone else's property so they . didn't know what to do about it. 'We just didn't know it was going to fall on her like that,' said Kim Christopher, cousin of the victim. 'The whole house is torn up,' she said. 'It's awful'. Christopher added that Verzani, a third grader at Hazel Fischer Elementary School in White Pines, 'liked to bake and dress-up... princess and stuff.' Fatal: The fir tree which collapsed onto the house was 100-foot tall and three-foot in diameter . Unexpected: The tree sliced through the house in what has been the worst storm of the winter in the area . Firefighters responding to a 911 call . maneuvered through unplowed snow and had to call in heavy equipment to . lift the tree off the house, a process that took an hour, Ebbetts Pass . Fire District Chief David Baugher said. The fierce storm was the worst seen in Southern California so far this winter, leaving thousands without power on Monday. Severe winter storms have caused havoc in the past in Ebbetts Pass, a mountainous section of Calaveras County about 30 miles northwest of Yosemite National Park. Fierce: Severe winter storms have caused havoc in the past in Ebbetts Pass, a mountainous section of Calaveras County about 30 miles northwest of Yosemite National Park . During the week of Thanksgiving 2010, snow led to 250 calls about fallen trees, though there were no fatalities, Baugher said. Federal authorities at the time declared Ebbetts Pass a disaster area. The storm that rolled into the region Saturday on the eve of spring followed a dry winter caused by La Nina, a condition in which the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean is lower than normal. ‘It was very unusual because it was probably the first actual major storm for this year,’ said Stuart Seto, a National Weather Service forecaster. Snow was to blame in the deaths of a skier and a snowboarder in the Sierra, where storms dropped more than 5 feet of snow on some ski resorts over the past few days. Risky: Two people were killed and another person was hurt in separate accidents on California slopes . A 30-year-old snowboarder on Sunday fell head first into the snow at China Peak Mountain Resort northeast of Fresno and suffocated, said resort owner Tim Cohee. Fresno County Deputy Coroner Kelly Wiefel told the Mariposa Gazette that the victim was Kynan Stanners, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection firefighter who lived in the Bass Lake area. In Northern California, a skier fell into a hole created by an underflow of water at the Sierra-at-Tahoe resort early Sunday afternoon. The El Dorado County Sheriff's department said the victim was 54-year-old Yiwei Hu of Gold River. Deadly: A man snowboarding at China Peak Mountain Resort died after falling head-first into the snow . Skiing or snowboarding in deep snow always carries risks, and anyone hitting the slopes in those conditions should take proper precautions, said Steven Hemphill, Sierra-at-Tahoe spokesman. ‘Always partner up, be with a partner at all times,’ Hemphill said. At Kirkwood Mountain Resort, a skier was taken to a hospital after being injured in a small avalanche, said resort spokesman Michael Dalzell, adding that he didn't know the extent of the person's injury. The National Weather Service predicted more snow was likely to fall in the Lake Tahoe area early Tuesday.","Haley Verzani was asleep in her bed when the 100-foot tree collapsed onto the family home .

Chancellor George Osborne has risked causing a rift in the Coalition after putting plans for a third runway at Heathrow 'back on the table', it has been claimed. Mr Osborne has persuaded David Cameron to push for a U-turn on plans for expansion at Heathrow, in a move which has reportedly infuriated Nick Clegg by overturning a key manifesto pledge. The Chancellor has refused to rule out expanding Britain's biggest airport because he believes it is key to our 'hub status' and essential to Britain's economic future, according to the Independent on Sunday. Vital: George Osborne has reportedly claimed that expansion of Heathrow Airport is key to Britain's economic future . Full to capacity: Experts claimed not expanding Heathrow would cost the UK economy up to £8.5bn a year . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, along with environmental campaigners and Transport Secretary Justine Greening are all among those said to be furious at the move. The newspaper said that Mr Osborne introduced Heathrow as a possible venue for expansion at a Cabinet meeting this month. Earlier this month a report suggested that the UK economy will suffer by up to £8.5billion per year over the next decade if Heathrow does not undergo significant expansion. If expansion were to go ahead it would not happen until after the next election. A strategy review on aviation, combined with a paper on 'hub status', is due later this summer. Rift: The plan by George Osborne to put Heathrow expansion 'back on the table' is said to have infuriated Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . Just five months ago plans for Heathrow expansion were said to have been 'off the agenda' after Labour apparently joined the Coalition in ruling out the third runway. Mr Osborne appeared to back the decision when his Autumn Statement in November declared that he would consider all options for South-east airport expansion, with the exception of Heathrow. Activists had opposed plans for an expansion at Heathrow on the grounds of disturbance and pollution from aircraft. Possible plans revealed last year showed how Heathrow could look if expansion went ahead . The plans for a third runway have been met with constant strong opposition from local residents near the proposed site . Alternative: One of the other options proposed has been an airport hub on the Thames estuary which would hold up to 150 million passengers a year . Both Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos in 2010 had promised there would be no third runway at Heathrow, but other factors appear to have now changed the mind of the Chancellor. Chief among those is a fear that Britain is being left behind by Euro rivals competing for business from Brazil and China. Alternatives to Heathrow expansion include improving RAF Northolt in Ruislip, Middlesex for business flights, just 13 miles away. Expansion at Gatwick has also been suggested but is not thought to be a popular idea, while the controversial 'Boris Island' airport in the Thames estuary would take too long to build, according to some.",Chancellor says third runway is 'key to Britain's economic future'

A single-engine plane crashed in Naples on Friday afternoon killing its pilot, the host of a popular fishing TV show. Spanish Fly presenter Jose Wejebe, of Florida Keys, died when his kit plane plunged into a field near the runway shortly after take-off from Everglades Airpak. The plane departed to the north but authorities said they do not know exactly where it was headed. Tragic: Spanish Fly presenter Jose Wejebe, of Florida Keys, died when his kit plane plunged into a field near the runway shortly after take-off from Everglades Airpak . It fell from the sky at around 4.45pm, landing in privately owned land next to the public airport’s runway. Officials have not yet determined a cause. The carnage could not be seen from the airport terminal, but smoke from the crash was visible up to two miles away. A witness described it as looking like a house on fire. Wejebe, 54, was alone on the Comp Air 8, a kit plane that can seat six adults and two children. No other casualties were reported at the airstrip, which was unstaffed at the time. The host was known for his extensive travels chasing big fish, which took him from the Gulf of Mexico to the Galapagos, and had a strong following in the fishing community - one of his social networking pages has 66,000 followers. Solo: Wejebe, 54, was alone on the Comp Air 8, a kit plane that can seat six adults and two children . His ex-wife, Lynne Calero, told the Naples News: ‘It’s awful. He was very close to his family. It’s a real waste.’ His only child, Kristin Wejebe, 28, recently filmed a father-daughter fishing show with him. ‘It was very important to her to be able to share that,’ said Calero, Kristin’s mother. ‘She was so proud.’ Wejebe was born in Cuba, where he lived for a short time before his family fled to Miami after Fidel Castro’s revolution. At the age of eight he learned to fish alongside his father. A teenager Wejebe bought his first boat with the money he made working at a gas station and became a fishing guide in South Florida. He made it into the mainstream when the first episode of Spanish Fly aired on ESPN-2 in 1995, following him on fishing expeditions. A second show, Vida del Mar, followed on ESPN in 2001. Popular: The host was known for his extensive travels chasing big fish, which took him from the Gulf of Mexico to the Galapagos, and had a strong following in the fishing community . The airpark where the crash happened is on 29 acres on the southwest end of Everglades City. It sees about 5,000 flights a year. While Southwest Florida has seen several plane crashes in recent years, few have been fatal. Of four crashes in 2008, a total of 12 pilots and passengers survived in three separate crashes.

"By . Peter Campbell . PUBLISHED: . 20:06 EST, 10 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:47 EST, 11 April 2012 . The boss of British Gas owner Centrica has scooped a £4million bonus – on top of the £10million he made last year. Sam Laidlaw’s incentive payment comes despite the fact that his firm has plunged millions of its customers into misery with inflation-busting rises in their energy bills. British Gas, which provides power to 13million families in the UK, last year hiked household bills by 18 per cent for gas and 16 per cent for electricity. Wealthy: Sam Laidlaw, Chief Executive of Centrica, earned a £4m bonus last year despite plunging millions of its customers into misery . Mr Laidlaw’s performance-related payment also comes despite the fact that Centrica saw its profits fall by more than £1.5billion over the past year – from £2.8billion to £1.27billion. His £10million earnings were revealed in Centrica’s annual report for 2011, published a fortnight ago. The £4million windfall revealed last night comes after two of the group’s many long-term incentive schemes paid out. The staggering amount is enough to pay the average family’s energy bill for the next 3,000 years. Mr Laidlaw, Centrica’s chief executive, received company shares worth £3.4million as the delayed instalment of his 2009 bonus. And he was gifted another £620,000 in shares from a second long-term plan, which also dates back to 2009. To receive both amounts, he was required to hit performance targets. The same two schemes last year paid out £3million to the energy chief. Last night, the payout was greeted with disgust by critics. Labour’s energy spokesman Tom Greatrex said: ‘It is astonishing that there are even further massive payments to the chief executive of Centrica at a time when the firm’s customers are facing the pressure of increased bills and their incomes are being squeezed. News of the bonus will be unwelcome among bill payers who are struggling to make ends meet . ‘If this is a performance-related bonus, it begs the question as to what they consider to be effective performance. ‘It . shows that fundamental reform of the energy market is needed, because . at the moment it is not serving the interests of consumers.’ Paul . Green, of over-50s group Saga, warned that fuel poverty was becoming an . increasing problem for the elderly. He said: ‘Energy prices are . continuing to rise leaving elderly people with less cash and a grim . choice of whether they should turn the heating on or have a hot meal. ‘It . is a worry that more people will become fuel poor in the future and we . need to try and stop this from happening by offering them assistance and . urging energy companies to reduce their bills.’ The . £4million payout comes less than two weeks after Centrica put out its . annual report, detailing eye-watering pay and perks for the Centrica . boss, including a discount of almost £700 on his annual energy bill – . granted because he sits on the company’s board. Even . though his basic salary fell from £2million in 2010 to £1.3million, he . benefited from numerous share plans pushing his 2011 earnings to . £10million. His basic pay included £63,000 for a car and driver as well . as £279,000 in lieu of pension payments. A further £101,250 was paid into his pension pot, and he received shares in the company worth £848,000 at today’s price, although he won’t be able to cash those in for three years. Last night a Centrica spokesman defended the latest pay-out, saying the awards were ‘dependent on the achievement of demanding performance targets’ and also reflected ‘strong business growth in the last three years’. He added: ‘Over that period, Centrica has generated post-tax profits of nearly £4billion, invested over £7billion in securing energy supplies and paid around £2billion in tax.’ Earlier this year, the Daily Mail revealed that the number of pensioners dying from hypothermia has nearly doubled in five years, a period when a succession of cold winters has been coupled with drastic rises in energy bills. Official figures showed that 1,876 patients were treated in hospital for hypothermia in 2010/11, up from 950 in 2006/07. Three-quarters of victims were pensioners, with cases soaring among the over-60s more than any other age group.","British Gas last year hiked household bills by 18 per .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 04:44 EST, 23 April 2012 . The house is like many others nearby. Blinded by boards over windows after witnessing the worst kind of violence, the white two-story house, its paint chipped and its front steps crumbling, sits vacant behind a rusty iron fence that separates an overgrown yard from the cracked sidewalk. About the only difference between it and thousands of boarded-up buildings in Chicago's most notorious neighborhood is that Oscar-winning actress and singer Jennifer Hudson grew up here - and her mother, brother and nephew died here, allegedly gunned down by Hudson's brother-in-law, a known gang member. Horror house: The former home of Jennifer Hudson is boarded up in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago after the murder of her mother, brother and nephew . That and the shrine of teddy bears, candles and flowers was bigger than others that sprout up on these blocks when life ends violently. When the trial of William Balfour begins Monday in the 2008 killings, it will be an all-too-familiar story of death and violence in Englewood on the city's South Side. Hudson’s mother Darnell Hudson Donerson, 57, and older brother Jason, 29, were found dead at the family’s home on Chicago’s south side in 2008. The singer then offered $100,000 for her missing . nephew Julian King's safe return. The child's body was found three days later in a . vehicle on the city’s west side with multiple gun shot wounds. Ms . Hudson is on the witness list for the trial of her sister's estranged . husband William Balfour who is accused of killing her family. At a time when cities across the . country have seen the number of homicides fall, sometimes dramatically, . Chicago's jumped by a whopping 60 per cent the first three months of the . year, and Englewood's violence was a big reason why. Charged: William Balfour is set to go on trial this week in the murders of Jennifer Hudson's mother Darnell Hudson Donerson, older brother Jason and nephew Julian King . Trial: William Balfour will be tried for murder starting this week at the Cook County courthouse, shown here . The 15 slayings there in 2012 are nearly double the number reported during the same period a year ago. Last year, not only did the number jump to 60 from 40 the previous year, but the total number of homicides reported in this roughly 20-by-20 block community was more than half as many reported for the entire city of Washington, D.C. and a little less than a third of Houston's total for the year. 'It happens here all the time,' said Jean . Carter-Hill, a community activist whose group helps children and . families. 'I can't even run to all these funerals, it's just too many, . looking at all these dead people in caskets all the time.' In Chicago, Englewood has become synonymous with street crime. Since he took office last May, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has used the word 'Englewood' as almost shorthand for gangs, guns and the dangers facing the city's children. Warnings: Jennifer Hudson has told investigators in the murder case that she had misgivings about Balfour . But the deteriorating neighborhood has . presented him with one of his biggest challenges, becoming a focus for . his promise to deploy more police officers to the street while cracking . down on Englewood's gangs. 'The . mayor says very publicly that a murder in Englewood is a murder in the . city of Chicago [and] just because it happened there it is not OK,' said . Police Supt Garry McCarthy, in an AP interview. 'People feel abandoned in those neighborhoods and we are saying you are not abandoned.' Residents . say they've seen police commanders and anti-gang initiatives come and . go over the years, and the neighborhood just gets more violent and the . criminals more brazen. Just . as in years past when public housing residents slept in their bathtubs . to protect them from the bullets that pierced their walls, residents say . the fear of gun battles has pushed some of them deep into their homes . and away from their windows where they could be hit by stray bullets. 'People don't give a damn, they just . shoot you across the street, they come into your house and shoot you,' said 80-year-old Homer Wright, who made headlines this month after . shooting a teenager who allegedly broke into his tavern, where he'd . taken to sleeping to prevent break-ins. The authorities dropped charges against Wright but confiscated the handgun he owned illegally for self-protection. Harrowing: Jennifer Hudson poses with her Oscar in 2008 and brother-in-law William Balfour. She's expected to testify at his murder trial over the shootings of her mother, brother and nephew . Murder trial: William Balfour is the estranged husband of Jennifer Hudson's sister Julia. He is accused of killing her mother, brother and nephew four years ago . Protection: Homer Wright made headlines this month after shooting a teen who allegedly broke into his tavern, where he'd taken to sleeping to prevent break-ins . There are a host of reasons for Englewood's downward spiral. But they mostly boil down to an exodus of families from an area that was predominantly single-family homes, resulting in an explosion in the number of abandoned buildings, and an influx of gang members. Home to 100,000 residents in 1960, Englewood's population has dwindled. It had dropped to about 40,000 in 2000 and to 30,000 just 10 years later. Part of the reason, Carter-Hill and others say, is that families moved out to safer places and others lost their homes when they lost jobs during the recession. According to the police department, . there are more than 4,100 abandoned buildings in Englewood, nearly 600 . of them vacated in just the last 15 months. Troubled relationship: Jennifer Hudson's sister Julia with her estranged husband William Balfour who is standing trial for murdering her relatives . One study found more vacant homes in Englewood and the community to the immediate west than anywhere in Chicago. It all has created an atmosphere ripe for a category of people nobody wanted to see: Gang members who left the city's torn-down public housing high rises and found the abandoned houses magnets for crime. 'We've seen gangs come in, run cords from the house next door for electrical service and make it look like a regular house and they're using it as a gang house,' said Leo Schmitz, commander of Englewood's police district. Moore said the Hudson family still owns their now-empty house, but they've apparently stopped trying to remodel it after vandals broke in at least twice to steal construction materials.

He sees Hudson's sister come by once in a while, but hasn't seen Jennifer Hudson, who even after she became famous came by to talk with people and even jump rope with kids outside. But he does see gangbangers on the street all day, every day. Among those, authorities said, was Balfour, the suspect in the Hudson family slayings. While prosecutors say the killings had a domestic motive, tied to his deteriorating marriage to the singer's sister, his life story is a familiar one in Englewood. A high school drop-out, Balfour was a member of the Gangster Disciples and had a long rap sheet for drug offenses, stealing cars and ultimately a seven-year stint in prison for attempted murder and vehicular manslaughter. A little more than two years after his release, he was behind bars again, charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Hudson's mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew. McCarthy said the Englewood gangs are . more rigid and territorial than the gangs he saw when he was a ranking . member of the police department in New York and chief in Newark, New . Jersey. Tragedy: Tributes lie outside the home in the Englewood neighbourhood of Chicago where Jennifer Hudson's mother and brother were shot dead . That means a rival gang member on a street where the drug trade is controlled by another gang can mean only one thing: Likely gunfire. In response, Schmitz said he has ordered intelligence about gangs distributed to all police officers, not just the anti-gang squad. And he's ordered officers out of their cars and walking the community more than ever before - a practice Carter-Hill said is necessary to build trust where there has long been suspicion of police. Antie Moore, who lives a few doors down from the Hudson house, said he thinks things have gotten worse since the national media arrived to interview people after the killings. A city clean-up crew came a few days ago, but Moore suspects it had more to do with news crews' return ahead of the trial than anything else. 'They only cleaned up the alley behind [the Hudson house] and a little bit of the lot next to it,' he said. Then, he said, 'They left.'

Fears for the health of Ukraine's jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko are growing after it was confirmed that she has been taken to hospital. Less than a week after images emerged apparently showing bruises inflicted on the former Prime Minister, a high-security police convoy was seen taking her for treatment. Tymoshenko's daughter, Yevgenia, has also said that the 51-year-old has agreed to end her hunger strike which started on April 20. Brutal: Eugenia Tymoshenko, left,  fears for her mother's health. Right, bruises she claims she sustained during a prison beating . This ambulance, pictured yesterday under police guard, is believed to be carrying Tymoshenko to a local hospital . Supporters of Tymoshenko speak with her daughter, Eugenia, outside the jail in Kharkiv where she is imprisoned . Her imprisonment has soured relations . between Ukraine and the West with Prince William among those boycotting . the country over the abuse claims. Her transfer from prison in the . eastern city of Kharkiv to a nearby hospital for treatment under the . supervision of German doctors was worked out last week in a compromise. But Wednesday's early morning transfer . seemed unlikely to relieve pressure on Yanukovich who has been thrown . on the back-foot by sharp Western criticism of his treatment of his . rival. Deputy Health Minister Raisa Moiseyenko said Tymoshenko was moved from her prison in Kharkiv to a local clinic Wednesday morning. Dr Lutz Harms, a neurologist with Berlin's Charite clinic, will supervise her treatment at the hospital because Tymoshenko does not trust government-controlled doctors. Moiseyenko said she hopes the hospitalisation and treatment will prompt Tymoshenko to end her hunger strike. Ukraine's Deputy Health Minister told reporters Tymoshenko was moved to the hospital this morning . Supporters supporters near the jail in Khariv shouted out 'Freedom for Yulia!' Fears: Yulia Tymoshenko thought she was 'in the last moments of her life' during the 'attack', her daughter said . Tymoshenko was jailed last October for seven years for alleged abuse of . power while in office, a charge she denied. She says she is the victim of a . vendetta by Yanukovich who narrowly beat her for the presidency in . February 2010. The European Union and the United States have condemned . her trial and sentencing as politically motivated and called for her to . be released. Authorities have denied she was mistreated. Her daughter, Yevgenia, said on . Tuesday her mother had agreed to end her hunger strike under the . supervision of a German doctor in a local hospital. Eyewitnesses in Kharkiv said . Tymoshenko was brought to a side entrance of the hospital by ambulance . on Wednesday morning in a heavily guarded convoy that included several . police cars. Two lines of white-coated hospital . staff shielded her as she was carried into the hospital on a stretcher, . preventing journalists and onlookers catching a glimpse of her. A few supporters nearby shouted out 'Freedom for Yulia!' Video: Eugenia has called on authorities to release surveillance footage of the 'attack' The state prison service, in a . statement, confirmed she had been moved to hospital 'for the course of . rehabilitation recommended by the international medical commission'. Tymoshenko appeared placid and . untroubled at World War Two Victory Day celebrations on Wednesday, . despite the growing political pressure. Addressing war veterans in Kiev, he . spoke of the need to defend world peace by shunning 'populism of all . types', but remained silent about Tymoshenko. Controversial: Yulia Tymoshenko during her trial last year . In an embarrassing setback on Tuesday, . he called off an informal summit meeting in Yalta of Central and . Eastern European leaders after several of them said they were staying . away because of the Tymoshenko affair. He quickly drew fire for this from other opposition figures. Arseny Yatsenyuk, leader of the Front . of Change party, said cancellation of the Yalta meeting amounted to a . 'shameful failure' for Ukraine. 'This leadership is dragging the . country and its people with it into international isolation,' Interfax . news agency quoted Yatsenyuk as saying. Vitaly Klitschko, world heavyweight . boxing champion who heads the Udar party, said: 'The leadership clearly . has no wish to change the situation and meet calls by Kiev's European . partners to respect human rights and democratic standards.' Western outrage over the treatment of . the charismatic Tymoshenko, who led the 2004 Orange Revolution street . protests which doomed Yanukovich's first bid for the presidency, has led . to threats by European politicians to boycott the European soccer . championships which Ukraine co-hosts next month.

The teenager, who has a mental age of five, was locked on a school bus for 45 minutes after the driver failed to notice her when he parked in Dormanstown, East Cleveland . It was only when Mr Wales rang the bus company to report that Ellie had not returned home that the driver realised he had left the teenager on the bus. Ellie, who has the mental age of a five-year-old due to her autism and learning difficulties, came home in tears after the incident and told her parents that she thought she had done something wrong. The bus driver, who works for Redcar and Cleveland Council, has been suspended and will face a disciplinary hearing. The teenager's escort, who was also on the bus, has resigned. Mr Wales, 46, chairman of the Redcar Development Trust, said: 'Ellie has told us that the bus didn’t go the normal way and didn’t drive past our house.

Concern: The driver only realised he had left the teenager on the bus when her father rang the bus station, pictured, to find out where she was . Mr Wales said: 'We were frantic with worry about Ellie and the whole experience has really affected her. 'I thought the bus must be running late. I rang the school and they told me Ellie had got on the bus OK. 'I then rang the bus company and they said that she had never been on the bus. I started to panic and rang the school back.

'So excited': Saiba Khatoon (pictured) was stabbed to death at her home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after announcing that she was four months pregnant . A traumatised boy of seven was being comforted last night after his mother was stabbed to death just days after telling friends she was expecting a baby. Saiba Khatoon, 26, was knifed at her family home after revealing she was almost four months pregnant. The alarm was raised when her son was woken by a smoke alarm late at night and ran out of the house to get help from neighbours. One went into the house to find carer Mrs Khatoon lying dead in a downstairs room. Police were today questioning a 30-year old taxi driver believed to be a boyfriend of the dead woman on suspicion of murder. The . tragedy in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, occurred just days after Mrs . Khatoon, whose estranged husband worked as a doctor had excitedly . announced her pregnancy news to friends and neighbours. Friend Elisha Barnes, 26, said: 'Saiba came round to my house and was so excited about her news. 'You . could see it in her face and her eyes. She had been trying for a baby . for quite a while, but she had had several miscarriages in the past. 'She seemed absolutely delighted she was 18 weeks gone and was really looking forward to becoming a mum again. 'When . we saw Saiba at the weekend she said she was very happy and said she . would find out whether it was a boy or girl in two weeks' time.' She said they became friends when Mrs Khatoon moved into her house about four years ago. 'She was a lovely lady. You couldn't ask for a better friend,' she added. 'She was a carer for the disabled and was very kind. It's not sunk in yet. Her car is still outside and it will only be when it's gone that it starts to sink in. It's not right and I can't believe it.' She said Mrs Khatoon had a big family who were often at the house. Scene: Forensics officers outside the house where Mrs Khatoon was stabbed. Her seven-year-old son raised the alarm after running out of the home to get help . Police said officers were called just before midnight on Monday, May 7 by the North West Ambulance Service following reports a woman had been found with stab wounds. Officers attended and discovered the body. A post mortem has not yet taken place. Another neighbour said: 'Saiba's son inadvertently raised the alarm and ran to a neighbour's house and started banging on the door and letterbox. 'We believe Saiba had been seeing a man on and off since she was 16, but her family didn't approve of him. 'She was later married in an arranged marriage to a doctor, but the marriage failed and she began seeing this man again. 'At one time, there was a big row at the house and police were called, but we noticed he was back on the scene again.' 'Lovely lady': Mrs Khatoon with friends Sandra (left) and Elisha Barnes (right), who said the 26-year-old was really looking forward to becoming a mother again . A third neighbour Mr Amar Hussain, 28, said: 'Saiba has no enemies and I find it hard to believe someone would want to harm her. She had a heart of gold. 'She was looking forward to her birthday which was in a few days. She would have been 27. She always had a beautiful smile and wouldn't give anything away even if there was something wrong.'

Tragic: The killing of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher sparked an 11 day police siege of the Libyan embassy in St James's Square . Two detectives have visited Libya as part of the ongoing investigation into the murder of WPc Yvonne Fletcher. The killer of the police officer who was shot outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984 was never . convicted, but now 28 years on there are fresh hopes that her family may . finally see justice. The officers, from the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command, flew to Tripoli where they met Libyan officials to discuss how the investigation can be taken forward in the future. In a statement the force said: 'We hope these preliminary discussions will pave the way for the MPS and Libyan authorities to work jointly to identify who was responsible for WPc Fletcher’s murder in 1984.' The officers - a detective superintendent and a detective inspector - travelled to the nation’s capital on Monday and returned to the UK last night. They will remain in regular contact with WPc Fletcher’s family who will be given an update about the visit, the force said. WPc Fletcher, who was 25, was shot dead as she policed an anti-Gaddafi demonstration outside the Libyan People’s Bureau in April 1984. The bullets which killed her and injured 10 protesters came from inside the embassy. Her killing triggered an 11 day police . siege of the embassy in St James's Square and the UK cut all diplomatic . ties with the Middle East nation. Last month Libyan prime minister Abdurrahim El-Keib today made a historic visit to the spot where the young officer was shot dead. Changing times: David Cameron said allowing British police to fly to Libya investigate WPc Fletcher's killing was a really positive step. Diplomatic relations were cut with Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi, right, following the incident in 1984 . David Cameron said the visit was a . 'really positive step forward' in the inquiry into the 1984 killing of . the officer, who was shot dead as she policed an anti-Gaddafi . demonstration outside the Libyan Embassy in London. Ms Fletcher's mother Queenie, father Tim and sister Sarah Parsons have been hoping to see justice for their daughter ever since. In . 2009 the family and friends of Yvonne gathered at a memorial in her . honour at St James's square, the spot where she was killed, to . commemorate the 25th anniversary of her death. Mr . Cameron made the announcement as the north African state's interim . Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib visited 10 Downing Street. Mr . El-Keib promised that his country would 'work very closely together' with the UK to resolve outstanding questions about the killing of the . 25-year-old Wpc Fletcher, who was part of a team of 30 officers sent to . St. James's Square to keep the peace during a demonstration by Libyan . dissidents opposed to the rule of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. It is believed she was hit by a shot fired from within the People's Bureau. Mr . El-Keib worked with the opposition while in exile during Muammar . Gaddafi's dictatorship, and said he knew some of those involved in the . demonstration. Battle: Ms Fletcher's mother Queenie,(pictured) father Tim and sister Sarah Parsons have been hoping to see justice for their daughter ever since . He told Mr . Cameron: 'The Fletcher case is a case that is close to my heart . personally. I had friends who were demonstrating that day next to the . embassy.' 'It is a sad story. It is very unfortunate that it has anything to do with the Libyan people. 'I am here to tell you that we will work very closely together to resolve anything related to that issue.' Hopes of finding the killer of Wpc Fletcher were first raised following the revolution which toppled the dictator last year. But so far, plans to send a police team to Libya had been frustrated by a failure to secure approval from local authorities. Officers from New Scotland Yard and Home Office Minister James Brokenshire met Mr El-Keib today to discuss the Fletcher case. Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism said he was determined to get justice for Ms Fletcher. He added: 'We have never lost our resolve to solve this murder and achieve justice for Yvonne's family. We see today's announcement as significant.' Detectives remain in regular contact with WPc Fletcher's family and update them on developments. Mr El-Keib said Libya wanted to be 'long-term friends and partners' with Britain, and paid tribute to the role which the UK played in the international military mission to protect civilians from Gaddafi's forces during last year's uprising. Addressing Mr Cameron he said: 'You took a bold decision when it was very difficult for many to even consider supporting the Libyan people. You took that decision which inspired many of us.' Mr Cameron said: 'I am very proud of the role that Britain played to help secure a successful outcome in Libya and the support we gave through the Nato mission. 'I am very much looking forward to hearing about the progress towards a full democracy in Libya and the elections which you hope to hold before Ramadan this year.'","The officers travelled to the nation’s capital on Monday and returned to the UK last night .

A mother has revealed how she has had to bring her son back from the brink of death five times in a year due to his rare heart condition. Three-year-old Aaron Sweeney’s heart can stop for up to seven minutes each time he suffers a collapse. He is only alive thanks to his mother Jolaine Clark, 28, who has been trained to revive her son using a hand-held defibrillator which she keeps with her 24 hours a day. Lifesaver: Jolaine said having to revive her son multiple times was a terrible experience . Since his first collapse, which happened while he was watching television just over a year ago, Aaron has suffered five heart failures, three in the last three months. But despite his constant brushes with death the cheeky lad, who has been diagnosed with Prolonged QT Syndrome, known as ‘Sudden Death Syndrome’, still enjoys running around his home in Mosspark, Glasgow. Jolaine said: 'He’s just a normal three-year-old. The doctors said he’s not supposed to run around but I can’t stop him. 'He always racing around the flat and riding on his little electric quad bike.' Aaron, who lives with his mother and grandparents Elaine, 50, and Joe, 50, first collapsed while watching TV at his home in January last year. Quick-thinking paramedics managed to revive the boy and he made a full recovery.But doctors at the city’s Yorkhill Hospital failed to diagnose the condition. Aaron’s family were all trained to use a special hand-held defibrillator so he could return home and continue to attend nearby Martha House Day Nursery. In March last year he collapsed again and had to be revived. It was only when brave Aaron’s heart failed for a third time in December that doctors finally diagnosed him with Sudden Death Syndrome, a heart defect which develops in the womb. Jolaine, a former debt collector, added: 'As a mother it’s terrible to have to watch your son collapse and have to revive him. 'The first time it happened I didn’t know what to do. It was horrendous. 'At least now I am trained to help him, but I can’t go back to work and he’s off school at the moment.' Aaron was fitted with a special cardiac monitoring device, which was implanted in his chest in January. The device detects the moment when Aaron’s heart begins to fail and starts to record the condition of his heartbeat for doctors to read when he is taken to hospital. The young boy, whose heart failed as recently as last month, will undergo an operation later this year to fit a small permanent defibrillator under his skin that will trigger automatically if his heart begins to fail again. Jolaine added: 'He’s really great, always happy. He knows something is wrong with him but he handles it really well. 'We go for check-ups at Yorkhill every six to eight weeks and we are holding various charity events to try and raise money to keep a defibrillator at his school when he is old enough to go.'",Aaron will be fitted with a permanent defibrillator under his skin later this year that will trigger if his heart begins to fail again .

The 27-year-old died on Sunday after a freak gust of wind at Dunstable Downs, Bedfordshire caught the kite, which had a 20ft wingspan, and carried him away in front of his friends and family. He plunged 50ft onto the hillside and sustained multiple fractures including a broken leg and pelvis, before dying at the scene of a suspected heart attack. Freak accident: Marcus Garwood, 27, seen with his kite was swept away by a gust of wind . Horrific death: Mr Garwood plunged 50ft to the ground after his power kite was caught up in the strong winds . Tributes posted on Kite Crowd web forum . told how Mr Garwood 'loved what he did so very much' and revealed his . passion for power kiting, snowboarding and car racing. Mr Garwood, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, who attended Northfields Upper School and Dunstable College, is believed to have begun power kiting four years ago. The HSS tool hire worker had posted videos online displaying his talent for performing aerial tricks at heights of 20ft in winds of up to 40mph. A tribute on Kite Crowd forum by Newbiejumper, aged 32, who claims to be a friend of Marcus from Bedfordshire, said he witnessed the accident. He said: 'He launched got lofted held it out had it was looking like it was under control was coming down nice and steady he got to about 20ft off the floor the kite just dropped caught the wind and supermaned him the winds were comin up the hill and on the website just before the accident it was reading 11mph as far as i remeberand (sic) and bex your right he loved what he did so very much.' They continued: ‘It really was just a freak accident. ‘RIP Markos. Hope the winds are better where you are now.’ Dunstable Downs has a 200ft hill that is popular with kite fliers, as prevailing winds hit the ridge and are forced up at speed. Once off the ground, there are often separate bands of wind that can be even faster and potentially more dangerous. Flowers left at Dunstable Downs in tribute to Mr Garwood, who sustained severe injuries from his kite flying . Mr Garwood, who died on Sunday afternoon, is understood to have been using an ellipse-shaped kite described as being ‘double-skinned, like a soft, inflatable wing’. His death came a week after a two-day kite festival at the spot, which was run in association with the National Trust and featured professional displays. Stephen Hoath, a member of the . Flying Squad – which took part in the event and was in the area again on . Sunday – said of large power kites: ‘These things are becoming more . powerful and they are becoming more and more affordable as the price . comes down. ‘You are . creating an element of risk when flying them but I  think this chap was . just unlucky. From what I can gather there  was no inappropriate . behaviour going on.’ Many . kites now come with safety mechanisms that swiftly cut the powerful . effect of the wind by slackening some of the cords – but enthusiasts, . who often wear harnesses, can still be caught out by a sudden gust. Picturesque: The Dunstable Downs beauty spot in Bedfordshire is popular with kite enthusiasts . Peter . Shaw, vice-chairman of the British Kitesurfing  Association, said: . ‘It’s one of those calls where you have to decide whether to let go . quickly or  hang on. ‘The . most important safety  feature is the brain.

A . post-mortem examination was due to be carried out on the man today, . and an inquest is expected to be opened and adjourned this week. An ambulance service spokesman said he suffered ‘multiple traumatic injuries and went into suspected cardiac arrest’.

But now he has been left with a £250 bill to replace the artificial grass after it was pinched under cover of darkness. He said: 'I'm absolutely seething over it, I really am. 'How dare someone have the cheek to steal what I have had to work hard for. 'You try and make your house look nice and someone comes along and steals what you have got.' The gang struck between 10.30pm on March 19 and 6am the following day. Police forensic experts scoured his looted garden after footprints were left behind by the thieves.

Pupils have been warned they will be marched off the premises by security guards if they set foot in their local branch. Managers in Kettering, Northamptonshire, have put up signs saying: 'No children from Kettering Science Academy allowed in the store unless with an adult.' Banned: None of the 1,400 students at Kettering Science Academy in Northamptonshire could enter the store, pictured above . As well as barring the 1,400 pupils, . the store has told shoppers they must remove caps, hoodies and motorbike . helmets. The action follows thefts and the abuse of staff. Parents claimed their children were . being victimised. The mother of a boy of 14, said: 'I'm disgusted. We . often ask him to bring home a pint of milk or a loaf of bread. He goes . to church, he doesn't shoplift so why should he be barred?' Another mother said: 'There are a minority of bad pupils but the majority are being victimised.'

These kids might be young but they are out of control. Formal: A sign in the store's window makes the decision clear . 'Staff have been told that if they see . pupils in the shop on their own to contact security and they will be . escorted off the premises. It might seem extreme but staff must feel . safe at work.' The school is a joint primary and secondary school with pupils aged between three and 18. Signs at the store said: 'No children from Kettering Science Academy allowed in the store unless with an adult'. One mother, whose 14-year-old son attends the school, criticised the supermarket’s decision. 'I’m disgusted that my son won’t be allowed into the store any more,' she said. 'We often ask him to bring home a pint of milk or a loaf of bread on his way home. 'He goes to church, he doesn’t shoplift or anything so why should he be barred too? 'I don’t think Tesco should be allowed to do this.' Another mother added: 'There are a minority of bad pupils who cause the trouble but the majority are being victimised.' The supermarket defended the ban. A Tesco spokesman said: 'Our stores exist to serve customers and so restricting people from shops is always a last resort. 'We are taking these measures in this instance following a spate of thefts and intimidation of our staff, which is unacceptable. Unfair: Parents say that the decision is 'disgusting' and that students are being victimised . 'We have discussed this matter with the school and the local police and hope to see a resolution to this issue soon.' College principal Martin Campbell claims they have been helping Tesco find the culprits . 'We have helped the supermarket potentially identify a number of individuals who they may be taking legal action against,' he said. 'This issue lies with Tesco and if this is what they believe is the right course of action then that is up to them. 'It is not unusual for shops near schools to put signs up or employ security guards.' And this afternoon Tesco revealed that the ban has been lifted. 'Following constructive discussions with the school yesterday, the ban was lifted and we hope this matter has now been resolved,' a spokesman said. 'The ban was only ever a temporary measure, as we will not tolerate intimidation of our staff or disruption for customers.

A raucous house party ended like a scene from a horror film when a Russian immigrant allegedly butchered his roommate to death. Sergey Mamontov, 50, reportedly confessed to police that he got into a violent fight with his victim, chopped him up into pieces and tried to dissolve the remains in vats of bleach. Mamontov pounced on his roommate, 55, after he found him drinking with friends at 'a wild party' in their fourth-floor Brooklyn apartment, New York. New York police found human remains at Sergey Mamontov's apartment . He threw them out and became embroiled in the fatal fistfight which ended in the unnamed man's death. The victim's death had gone unnoticed until yesterday, when a friend of the dead man visited the apartment to look for him. But Mamontov then allegedly said: 'You're not going to see him any more - I cut him up,' according to the New York Post. The man alerted police who reportedly found vats containing bleach and acid and what appeared to be human body parts inside the flat and within the suspect's refrigerator. A friend of the deceased called police to the scene when he saw vats in the refrigerator with what appeared to be human remains . It was packed with a five-gallon bucket and eight smaller Clorox bottles, sources told the paper. Body parts and a rib cage were also uncovered in the fridge, a source told the tabloid. 'There isn't even room for an egg in the refrigerator', another source added. The paper reported that police investigators collected two Goodwill donation boxes which stank of human decaying flesh and trawled through every piece of rubbish from the building by hand in their search for more body parts. The pair had been sharing an apartment together for six months after Mamontov had rented out a room, but they did not get along, he revealed to police. Police then searched two Goodwill boxes that smelled like rotting flesh and combed all the trash in the building as they searched for more remains . Suspect Mamontov, who has previously been charged twice for drink driving and for grand larceny, told officers he chopped up his roommate and soaked his body parts in bleach as he hoped to destroy the evidence, sources claimed. A teenager, who lives in the flat directly below Mamontov, told of the moment he heard strange noises coming from upstairs. Alan Lazebnik, 16, a student at James Madison High School, told The New York Post: 'Me and my mom heard something really hard fell and I heard screaming. It was quick. I heard screaming, but it scared me.' The city's Medical Examiner's Office is studying suspected body parts, including what looked like fingers, to confirm they are human. Mamontov was being held in custody last night.","'Wild party' ends in vicious fight with Russian immigrant killing roommate and chopping him up into little pieces .

It wouldn’t be April without showers – and the heavens will duly open to spoil the Easter weekend. While the gloomy forecast will dampen spirits, it will be welcomed by water companies desperate for rainfall. But anyone hoping for a relaxation of the hosepipe ban will be sadly disappointed, as experts warn it would take more than a month of heavy rain to replenish water levels.

There will be occasional heavy rainfall which will be useful for some. ‘Temperatures will be near average for this time of year.

The man said Josie Connors made him sing to her child after he was punched and shut in a car boot . A 'vulnerable' man allegedly forced into unpaid labour by a family of travellers was shoved into the boot of a car and made to sing to his captor's child, a jury heard today. The man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - claimed he was punched in the face before being told to sing How Much Is That Doggy In The Window? and the Bob the Builder theme tune. He said he was treated 'like a slave' during the six months he spent with the Connors family at the Greenacres site near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, and was told he would be murdered if he tried to leave. Luton Crown Court heard the man escaped on July 18 last year by flagging down a police car while he was out canvassing for the Connors' block paving business. The jury was told the man raised the alarm about conditions at the site and on September 11 last year the police found 13 workers housed in caravans, sheds and even a horse box. Frances Oldham, for the Crown Prosecution Service, earlier told the jury: 'The Crown’s case is that members of the Connors family - initially father Tommy senior, and gradually over the past 15 years children Johnny, Jimmy, Josie, Tommy and Patrick and son in law James John - recruited vulnerable adults as workers on the pretence of offering them paid employment, food and accommodation. 'Typically recruitment would take place at centres for the homeless, soup kitchens or simply on the street.' She alleged the Connors family made large amounts of money by controlling and exploiting the vulnerable men. Over 15 years they are said to have kept dozens of victims in camps and ordered them not to leave. Their heads were shaved, they were paid little or nothing, were verbally abused and sometimes beaten, it was alleged. One worker described it as being 'like a concentration camp'. Mrs Oldham said: 'A number of words may spring to mind to mind to describe what was happening. They may not in the strict sense have been slaves but they were not free men.' Today the jury heard a recorded interview with a man who said that in January or February last year he was on the street outside a Greggs bakery in Wembley, north London, when he was approached by Josie Connors and her husband Jim. He told the police they asked if he wanted work as a labourer for £80 a day. One of the areas allegedly used as sleeping accommodation for the workers . He said it sounded like good money and went to live in a caravan at the Greenacres site with two other men. The man described Jim Connors as being of big build with curly hair. He . told police: 'He was Irish. He always seemed moody - he was horrible. Even his face is horrible. He is always aggressive, always shouting.' Josie Connors, whom he described as having long blonde hair, would 'try to make fools out of everyone,' he said. The . man said Jim Connors called him his son and that his alleged captors . introduced him to other members of the family as their 'little cousin'. But, he said: 'They still treated my like a slave. I felt worse than a . slave.' He told officers that the Connors threatened that if he tried to escape they would get another of the workers to murder him. 'Jim and Josie look for beggars and make slaves out of them,' he was heard to say. The . man, who was being helped to find a flat in Wembley by social services . at the time he was recruited, said nobody would have known he was at . Greenacres. James 'Big Jim' Connors (centre) is accused of beating the man and threatening to have him killed if he tried to escape . When he arrived at the caravan park, which he was told was in Luton, not near Leighton Buzzard, he said he was put in a small caravan with an older man and a black man, who was to later walk out. The jury heard he was told to wash outside using an outdoor tap, whereas he described the Connors’ caravan next door as a 'palace'. He said he was given egg sandwiches to eat most days, while the workers occasionally got sausage and chips and some days had nothing. 'It is horrible not eating,' he said. Describing his work he said: 'I was working from six o’clock in the morning to ten o’clock at night. It was hard labour - mainly block paving using heavy tools. It made my back ache.' He told police Jim Connors had given him a black eye on two occasions and had once kicked him in the testicles 'for standing around and doing nothing'. When the workers were out on jobs, the man said, customers would ask if Jim Connors was the boss because he was the one who sat in a car reading the newspaper. 'We worked seven days a week. We would get no rest at all,' he said. Once he had finished working on driveways, he said, he was made to clean the site at night dressed only in T-shirt and shorts. On one occasion, the man who said he used to be a professional window cleaner, had been told to clean the Connors’ caravan window 5 or 6 times because he had not done it properly. 'I had been mentally tortured and punished,' he said. Another time he was allegedly put in the boot of the Connors’ car, about a month after he joined them. He said he had been out canvassing for work but was punched because he had failed to get any customers. He said: 'I had been out canvassing the whole day. I didn’t manage to get any customers. Jim pulled up in the car and said ""What have you been doing? Why haven’t you got any customers? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?"" 'Jim punched me as hard as he could in the eye. It left quite a big bruise - it lasted for about a week. 'Then he shoved me in the boot of his car. He said ""get in there"". I went in head first. He quickly slammed down the boot. 'Josie was saying I had got to sing How Much is That Doggy in the Window? to her kid. I sang it and then she said I had got to sing Bob the Builder.' 'Like a concentration camp': A horsebox said to have been used as sleeping accommodation for workers allegedly forced into servitude by the Connors family . When he was recruited, he said, his benefit money was taken. He said: 'They said they would look after it. They said they had got to keep the money as we are one big family... I ain’t seen any money for six months. They took all my papers off me.' The man said he fled while out canvassing in Leighton Buzzard and hid in a garage before flagging down a passing police car on July 18 last year. 'I weren’t doing very well and didn’t get any jobs,' he said. 'I decided to run off and called the police for help.' The jury heard Jim Connors had told the man to lie about how he was treated if he was ever stopped by police. The man said: 'He said we are all a big family. If we were stopped by the police say they treated you well. I was to say I got paid £50 a day and we were a big happy family.' The workers were given a speech to give potential customers while out canvassing for driveway work, he said. While wearing a blue jacket with Kelly Construction on the back, a shirt and tie and orange cap he said they would have to say: 'Hello, sorry to disturb you. I am from Kelly Construction. We are building driveways. Would you like a free estimate? We can do you a really cheap deal.' If somebody said 'yes' he would call Connors, who would go round and give the customer a quote. He went on: 'The customer would say no at first but he would say ""All the rest of the neighbours are having it done. Why don't you have it done? The machines are in the area, we can do it cheaply for you.""' The tiny, grubby living quarters of one of the caravans on the Greenacres site near Leighton Buzzard . The money was always collected by Connors at the end of the work. 'It was always cash. He took the customer to the bank,' he said. On the police recording he said he was not getting paid and Connors would even take any tips from him. Asked what would happen if customers rang up to complain, he said Connors would give the phone to the older man from his caravan, who would promise to sort out the problem. 'He would give a different name and say ""Oh yeah, we will come and see you"", but never bothered,' he said. He said the work was in Harrow, Wembley, Enfield, Edmonton, Houghton Regis and 'a lot of places I didn't know'. When questioned about being allowed time off for illness he said: 'I didn't get any time off. They said: ""Travellers don't get ill. You are a traveller now. There is no such thing as illness. I had a stomach ulcer but Jim said: ""Carry on and work. You are a traveller now.""' The man said workers were given steel-toe-capped boots but no goggles, ear muffs or gloves, even though they were using heavy and noisy machinery. He will be cross-examined by defence lawyers via a live video link tomorrow. Seven members of the Connors family, six of whom live at the Greenacres Caravan Park, together face a total of 20 charges including conspiracy to hold a person in servitude, actual bodily harm, battery and conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. The accused are: Tommy Connors Senior, 52; James 'Jimmy' Connors, 24; James John Connors ('Big Jim'), 34; Johnny Connors, 28; Tommy Connors Junior, 26; Patrick Connors, 20; and Josie Connors, 30.

Members of Congress were among the wealthiest on Capitol Hill with fortunes most families can barely dream of, new figures have revealed. Democratic Congressmen have a median net worth of $878,5000 - almost ten times that of a typical American household. Driving up the figures were the super rich including Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts who is worth $232 million, in part because his wife Teresa belongs to the Heinz family. Riches: Democratic Senator John Kerry with his wife Teresa (left) who is an heir to the Heinz fortune. Republican representative Darrell Issa (right) has a personal fortune of $448million . Republicans also count the  super wealthy in their ranks too including California’s Representative Darrell Issa who has a fortune of $448million. The analysis of politicians’ financial disclosure forms by the Center for Responsive Politics revealed that there is huge wealth gap between lawmakers and the general public. Researchers claimed that if politicians did not have so much money they would concentrate on issues which affect people more and not be distracted by their own interests. The figures show that as income inequality has widened in America, so has the gap between Congress and the public has increased too. Capitol Hill is now overwhelmingly made up of lawyers and businessmen - some have never even worked outside of politics before assuming office. Across both parties, Congressmen earned $174,000 a year which is well above the median family income of $49,445 for 2010. Family fortunes: The Obamas wealth now stands at $7.3million according to the report while presidential challenger Mitt Romney has a vast personal fortune of more than $250million . Their net worth has been creeping up every year since 2004 and now dwarfs the median net worth of a typical U.S. household, which was $96,000 in 2009. The Democrats, who model themselves as defenders of the middle class, count 21 among their numbers who have assets of more than $10million each. It's very hard for someone of median wealth to serve in Congress, even if they could raise the money to get elected. Nolan McCarty, politics professor at Princeton University . President Obama also has a net worth of $7.3million, making him far richer than many of those who voted for him. The Center for Responsive Politics found that overall the Republicans were still the wealthiest of the two parties with a median net worth of $957,500. Some 35 have assets worth more than $10 million including Texas Representative Michael McCaul who boasts a $380million fortune. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has also faced repeated criticism over his reported fortune of $250million he acquired while working at a private equity company in the 1980s. Nick Carnes, assistant public policy professor at Duke University, who did not take part in the research, said that just two per cent of Congress was from a working class background. He said: ‘Politicians from working and middle classes are more likely to work hard on bread and butter domestic economic issues that matter to ordinary Americans’. Nolan McCarty, a politics professor at Princeton University, added: ‘It's very hard for someone of median wealth to serve in Congress, even if they could raise the money to get elected.'","Only 2pc of Congress comes from working-class backgrounds .

"Price of tall drinks to go up by 10 cents, while the price of grande drinks doesn't change . Will only affect areas near New York, Boston, Washington, Atlanta, Dallas and Albequerque . By . Reuters Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:54 EST, 3 January 2012 . Starbucks is raising prices by an average of about 1 per cent in parts of the U.S. including cities such as New York, Boston, Washington DC, Atlanta, Dallas and Albuquerque. Starbucks expects high prices for things like coffee, milk and fuel to cut into profits this year and -- along with restaurant operators ranging from Chipotle Mexican Grill to McDonald's Corp -- is raising prices to help offset some of that cost pressure. In New York City, prices for 12-ounce ‘tall’ brewed coffees and latte drinks each will go up 10 cents. Prices on about a half a dozen other beverages also will increase, Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson told Reuters. Standard: Grande drinks, like this cup pictured, are the store's bestsellers and their prices will not be increased, but the tall size will . The world's biggest coffee chain raised prices on some drinks in California and South Florida in November. Those regions are not affected by the pricing action. Mr Olson said the price for a 16-ounce ‘grande’ brewed coffee, Starbucks' most popular beverage, remains the same across the United States and has not changed since January 2011. The Seattle-based chain has not made across-the-board price increases since 2007, choosing instead to adjust prices on a market-by-market basis. Starbucks caters to a somewhat higher-income customer and recently raised prices without apparent pushback. Targetted cities: New York, Boston, Washington D.C., Houston and Albequerque are among the cities in the East and South that will be hit by the hike . The company previously said it expects costs for commodities such as coffee and milk to lower fiscal 2012 earnings by about 21 cents per share.

A businesswoman was sacked after a night entertaining clients ended in spectacular embarrassment after she mocked a woman for drinking diluted alcohol. High-powered financial adviser, Amanda Daughters, faces claims she reduced a woman client to tears after demanding why she was only drinking spritzers, calling her partner a 'c***' and dragging him outside for a cigarette even though he didn't smoke. Exactly what happened at the Avalon pub, in Balham, south London, is hotly disputed by Miss Daughters who - while agreeing she was 'a bit hazy' after having 'quite a bit' to drink - swiftly apologised and denies anything she did justified her summary dismissal from her job. Amanda Daughters (left) and friend at the races. Miss Daughters admitted she had drunk 'quite a bit' on the night she was meant to be entertaining clients in Balham, south London . Miss Daughters, founder and former MD of Balham-based Aqua Financial Solutions Ltd, was given her marching orders in 2010 and had her unfair dismissal claim against the company rejected by an employment tribunal in October that year. However, the Employment Appeal Tribunal has now ordered a re-hearing of her case, ruling that the 'clear dispute' over what happened at the Avalon on the Friday night of January 22, 2010, must be further investigated and resolved. Judge William Birtles said Aqua's chairman, Carolyn Bennett, received a call from Ms Daughters at about 8pm that evening, saying she had 'fu**ed up again' and offended a client. Miss Daughters sent an apologetic email to the client early the next morning saying 'I hope you can forgive me'. And the woman, although castigating her for her 'inappropriate and unprofessional' behaviour, was understanding and emailed back, 'let's just move on'. However, the 'very upset and vociferous' client and her partner later spent an hour and a half complaining to Ms Bennett, who was 'very embarrassed and angry'. The client told Ms Bennett it was 'apparent she had already been drinking' when Miss Daughters arrived at the bar for a meeting to discuss financial advice. The woman said Miss Daughters became 'more inebriated' as the evening wore on and at one point 'dragged' her partner outside to have a cigarette, even though he was a non-smoker. Drinking: The pub where Miss Daughters met her clients and the alleged bad behaviour that led to her dismissal took place . The client also reported that Miss Daughters had called her partner 'a c**t' which, although it was said jokingly, he found shocking and offensive. Judge Birtles added: 'When the client did not want to carry on drinking at the same pace as her, Miss Daughters berated her for not wanting to carry on drinking and demanded to know why she was drinking spritzers. 'The client became so upset that she began to cry.' Miss Daughters accepted she had offended the client and 'it was probably not sensible to drink in client meetings'. She said the details of what happened were 'inevitably a bit hazy'. She argued the client, with whom she said she had been drinking for four hours, had 'become over-sensitive through drink' and the incident was 'not unduly serious' as the woman had accepted her apology. Accusation: Miss Daughters allegedly had words with her client about the consumption of wine spritzers . However, Ms Bennett 'viewed the matter extremely seriously' and Judge Birtles said disciplinary action was launched, culminating in Miss Daughters' dismissal on grounds of alleged 'gross misconduct'. A south London employment tribunal concluded in October 2010 that it had 'no hesitation in concluding that Miss Daughters' conduct justified summary dismissal without notice'. Overturning that ruling, Judge Birtles said: 'In this case there was a clear dispute on the evidence as to what had taken place in the Avalon bar on the evening of January 22, 2010. 'The Employment Tribunal made no attempt to reconcile these differing versions,' said the judge, who added the tribunal had failed to explain why it considered Miss Daughters' dismissal justified and 'within the range of reasonable responses'. 'Essentially, the tribunal made an error of law in saying that there was no conflict of fact between what Miss Daughters said had occurred on the night of January 22, 2010, and the view taken by Aqua. 'These were serious differences of fact that the tribunal did not attempt to properly resolve', ruled the judge. Allowing Miss Daughters' appeal, Judge Birtles sent her unfair dismissal claim back to a fresh employment tribunal for a re-hearing, a date for which has yet to be set.",Amanda Daughters disputed dismissal at industrial tribunal .
"Most of the 96 animals have been destroyed or exported to Europe . Move kills idea of using cloned animals for food production . By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 6 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:03 EST, 6 April 2012 . Public fears about ‘Frankenstein farming’ have killed off plans to sell milk from Britain’s only herd of clone cattle. Most of the 96 animals – sired by two bulls bred from embryos from a cloned cow – have been destroyed or exported to Europe. The farmer who owned the cows decided to get rid of them after it became clear the public would not accept milk or meat from them. In effect, the move kills the idea of using cloned animals or their offspring for food production in the UK for the foreseeable future. Regret: Steven Innes is saddened that he has to sell off his herd of cows . The Daily Mail revealed two years ago that Steven Innes had bought the two bulls and bred milking cows from them. At that stage, the cows were too young to produce milk, but the news triggered a public backlash amid concerns that clone farming is cruel. Now it has emerged that Mr Innes and his family, who run Newmeadow Holsteins near Nairn in Scotland, have abandoned plans to produce milk from the cows. Official records show he has destroyed 42 of the 96 Holsteins and exported 31 to Portugal. One of these fates awaits the remaining 23.Most consumers oppose ‘clone farming’ with concerns both for animal welfare and human health, according to research by the Food Standards Agency. Disappointing: Official records show Mr Innes has destroyed 42 of the 96 Holsteins and exported 31 to Portugal . Leading supermarkets also made it clear they would have nothing to do with any milk produced by the 96 cows. When Mr Innes first bred them, it was unclear whether he would need to get safety approval to sell any milk or meat from them. Initially, the FSA ruled that the food would need to be assessed for safety, but it subsequently changed its mind. Mr Innes said there was never any question that the milk from the cows would be unsafe and insists he was surprised by the negative reaction. ‘It was very distressing for me and my family,’ he said. ‘We had taken advice and felt we had followed all the rules and regulations, but we do accept that we hadn’t fully appreciated that there would be such a negative reaction. ‘What we do regret is that we didn’t anticipate that the level of interest would be so high and, had we done so, we would have done things differently. ‘As a farmer, I want to care for my cows and produce food the public want to enjoy.’ Upset: Mr Innes said he was working really hard to find a buyer for the remainder of his herd, but had so far been unsuccessful . Mr Innes said the decision to destroy . a large number of the cows was ‘sad and distressing’. He was ‘working . really hard to find a buyer for the remainder, but unfortunately we have . so far been unsuccessful’. Simon . Gee of Holstein UK, which keeps breed records for milking cows, said no . new clone offspring had been born and registered in the UK since the 96 . on the Scottish farm. This . means only a handful of animals with clone ancestry – fewer than five – . are now living on British farms. All of these can be traced back to a . single clone cow in the U.S. ‘There is no future for cloned farm animals if you look at the public reaction,’ said Mr Gee. He . also suggested most farmers had no interest in using clones. ‘Farmers . do not want lots of copies of the same animal for either breeding or . food,’ he said. ‘They are constantly looking to improve the animals they . have on farms.’ The . cloned animal that produced the embryos of Mr Innes’s bulls was created . from cells taken from the ear of a  show cow in America, Vandyk-K . Integrity Paradise. There are concerns about the suffering associated with animal cloning, with many cases of miscarriage, early death, gigantism and malformed organs. Peter Stevenson, of the campaign group Compassion in World Farming, said other farmers and the Government should ‘realise cloning is not the way forward’. He added: ‘The idea of using clones and their offspring to produce milk and meat is unacceptable to consumers.’","Most of the 96 animals have been destroyed or exported to Europe .

Controversial: Private security guards would be able to impose £80 on-the-spot fines for rowdy patients in hospitals under radical new plans being discussed by the government . Private security firms could impose on-the-spot fines to rowdy troublemakers in A&E to help reduce the growing violence in Britain's hospital wards. Under the controversial proposals, the guards working for the firms would also  be allowed to confiscate alcohol from those who are taken to emergency departments following drunken disorder. The government hopes the £80 penalties will assist medics who are often threatened with violence. It is also considering a move to allow the NHS to apply for antisocial behaviour injuctions which could see persistent troublemakers banned from the wards. The Police Federation met the idea with concern claiming the move it was not in the public's best interest. Paul . McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: . 'The public should be greatly concerned about the gradual erosion of . warranted police officers and the attempt to fill the gap with private . security guards and police community support officers.' But the Government claimed the plans - part of its alcohol strategy - were designed to hand back power to the community. A . spokesman told The Times: 'We will support NHS trusts and . foundation trusts to work with their local police to ensure that . appropriate action is taken, including through hospital security staff . being empowered through the Community Safety Accreditation Scheme. 'Under this scheme, accredited staff . can be given powers to issue penalty notices for disorder to those . individuals whose drunken behaviour is likely to cause harassment, alarm . or distress. They can also take action against the consumption of . alcohol in a designated public place.' There are already a number of hospitals in the UK which have piloted similar schemes.

At Basildon Hospital, Essex, security guards have had similar powers for four years but have not yet used them. Security guards would need to take a training course and would need a special badge from the chief constable of their police force before they are handed the powers.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We believe local people, services and businesses are best-placed to tackle these issues in partnership with law enforcement.

A twice suspended doctor banned for prescribing the wrong drugs and carrying out unauthorised operations is back at work. London GP Arun Raunier also failed basic exams but to the fury of former patients has been allowed back into medicine by the General Medical Council (GMC). Rauniar was suspended in 2008 and then again in 2010 after it was found he had not improved as a doctor. Originally he had performed ‘inappropriate’ operations, including circumcision, at his Leyton surgery in east London while also falsely claiming to be a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Back to work: Despite failing exams and being suspended twice Arun Raunier has been allowed to practice as a doctor again in the UK (Picture posed by model) Dr Rauniar had also failed to assess and examine patients properly, held out-of date emergency drugs and believed it was not his job to deal with mental health issues. 90-year-old mother Lydia Sandford was prescribed drugs used to treat dementia patients by the bungling GP, but in fact had suffered a mini stroke. Her son Geoff Sandford made a formal complaint against Rainiar claiming his actions sped up her death and he has maintained for a decade that he should have been struck off for what he did to his mother. ‘It’s absolutely outrageous,’ he told The Sun. ‘This man is a liar and a danger to patients. The GMC attitude seems to be that he hasn’t killed anyone.’ The Sun claim that he is now back at work under supervision at a different east London surgery. Back in April 2008 he was found guilty of multiple failings by the GMC. Shocked: Family of his patients say the GMC, pictured, should have struck the doctor off . At that hearing he was ordered to retrain and blocked from practising without supervision for two years. In the same year he was asked to sit medical exams testing his judgement and problem solving. But he fell short, scoring 381 points when he needed 480 to pass. Two years later the GMC said he had made no progress and suspended him for again for a further 12 months. A new GMC panel considered his case last month and has said that as long as he shows he has improved as a doctor they will allow him to take a new GP’s job in the UK. Chairman Dr Robin Knill-Jones said: ‘The Panel considers that a period of three years will be needed for you to address your retraining issues and give you sufficient time to prepare for and undergo a further performance reassessment, before your case is reviewed. ‘The Panel is encouraged by your efforts and now expect you to embark on a more formal approach to your retraining.’","London GP Arun Raunier also failed basic .

Charles Manson, one of America's most notorious mass murderers, was denied parole today in his 12th and possibly final bid for release from a California prison. Manson, 77, who has not attended parole hearings in recent years, was not present for the review of his case by the state board at Corcoran State Prison where he is serving a life term. The Corrections and Rehabilitation Department said Manson would next be eligible for parole in 15 years, when he would be 92 years old. Face of a monster: Mugshots of Manson in 1971 and in 2011 (right). He was denied parole at Corcoran State Prison in California today where he is serving a life term . He had been denied release 11 times before, most recently in 2007, when the board ruled that he 'continues to pose an unreasonable danger to others and may still bring harm to anyone he would come in contact with'. There was currently no explanation for the board's latest rejection, which was announced two and a half hours after the hearing began this morning at Corcoran, about 175 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Amid the hippie culture of the 1960s, Manson, a charismatic ex-convict, put together a collection of runaways and outcasts known as the Manson Family. In the summer of 1969 he became one of . the 20th century's most infamous criminals when he directed his mostly . young, female followers to murder seven people. Son of a serial killer: Matthew Roberts believes that he is the lovechild of Charles Manson . Questionable history: Roberts, 44, claimed he was conceived at a San Francisco, drug-fuelled orgy attended by Manson in 1967 and has said: 'It was like finding out your father is Hitler.' Veracity: Roberts cannot be sure Manson is his father unless he sees 'somebody scrape a piece of skin off [Manson's] ass and bring it to a lab' Among the victims was actress Sharon . Tate, the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski, who was stabbed 16 . times by members of the cult in the early morning hours of August 9, . 1969. Her sister Debra Tate attended Manson's parole hearing this morning and testified before the board. Four other people . also were stabbed or shot to death in Tate's home that night by the . Manson followers, who scrawled the word 'Pig' in blood on the front door . before leaving. The following night, Manson's group stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death, using their blood to write 'Rise,' 'Death to Pigs' and 'Helter Skelter' - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song - on the walls and refrigerator door. Roberts first wrote to Manson in 2009 and the killer replied to Matthew's letter straightaway and has since sent him a string of ten rambling handwritten notes and postcards signed with the swastika . Manson is serving a life sentence for those seven slayings and the murder of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who was stabbed to death in a separate murder in July 1969. Manson originally was sentenced to death in 1971 but was spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. In 1977, his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole. California later resumed executions but Manson's life sentence was left intact. A photograph of Manson released last . month showed the aging, gray-bearded killer, his face still bearing the . scar of a swastika he carved into his forehead during his sensational . 1970 murder trial. Following . what was likely to be Manson's last parole hearing, the man who is . convinced that the mass murderer is his father said he wanted to be sure . after previously inconclusive DNA tests. Justice: Debra Tate, sister of slain actress Sharon Tate, celebrates after convicted mass murderer Charles Manson was denied freedom for the 12th time today. She attended the parole hearing and testified before the board . Killed: Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson and his cult followers in 1969. She was almost nine months pregnant . Matthew Roberts, 44, claimed he was conceived at a San Francisco, drug-fuelled orgy attended by Manson in 1967 and has said: 'It was like finding out your father is Hitler.' He told CNN today that he cannot be sure Manson is his father unless he sees 'somebody scrape a piece of skin off [Manson's] ass and bring it to a lab'. Roberts first wrote to Manson in 2009 and the killer replied to Matthew's letter straightaway and has since sent him a string of ten rambling handwritten notes and postcards signed with the swastika - a symbol the killer has tattooed on his forehead. He also confirmed he was his father, recalling times spent with Matthew's mother. Maximum security: Manson is being held at the Corcoran State Prison compound in California.

Raid: Mr Inkley stands by the evidence of the burglary on his cricket club pavilion, where raider forced open steel doors and ransacked cupboards . When Mike Inkley discovered burglars had ransacked the pavilion at his cricket club, he immediately rang the police. But he was shocked to be put through to a call centre and be told that officers would not come out to a ‘non-residential burglary’. Instead, he was told, it could take up to two days before police could take the details of the crime – in a ‘telephone appointment’. To add to his anger, he was told not to go inside the pavilion and check if anything had been stolen until a scenes-of-crime officer had been dispatched, a process which could take up to 24 hours. The response, from a force which has . been told it needs to make savings of over £40million, will add to fears . that property crime is increasingly being treated as a low priority. In . the end, after the 50-year-old had told the call centre worker the . response was unacceptable, officers were dispatched to the ground a few . hours later. Yesterday Mr Inkley said the call centre system risked undermining public faith in the police. ‘We . want an officer to come round and tell us it’s all right and everything . is under control – not speak to someone from a call centre 30 miles . away. ‘It just lowers your confidence in what they do.’ The . company director was walking his dog at Walton-le-Dale cricket club in .

He . rang the new non-emergency 101 number from his mobile phone and was . informed the force did not send officers out immediately for . non-domestic burglaries. He was told he could make a witness statement to the ‘telephone investigation unit’ in the next couple of days, and to keep out of the pavilion until a forensics officer had inspected it. After a member of staff from the call centre rang back, he insisted that someone was dispatched. Thieves who broke in to Walton-le-Dare cricket club were said to have been looking for keys to the club's lawnmowers . A scenes-of-crime officer duly arrived four hours after he reported the crime and a police officer two hours later. Yesterday Mr Inkley described the policy of sending an officer out only if one was demanded as ‘lunacy’. ‘It just means criminals will continue doing those sorts of burglaries because they know they will never get caught.’ The thieves who broke in last week are thought to have been searching for keys to the club’s lawnmowers. In the end they left empty-handed, though not before causing £200 worth of damage. Let down: Mr Inkley said the experience with police left him feeling as if they were 'call centre cops' Rachel Baines, chairman of the Lancashire Police Federation, said she sympathised with Mr Inkley. ‘Whatever the incident is, people want to see a police officer and I totally understand that,’ she said. Lancashire Police said the telephone investigation unit had been introduced last November to resolve ‘less serious’ crimes more quickly. A spokesman said the employee had been wrong to tell Mr Inkley that it would not be possible to send an officer immediately. ‘If a victim of crime wants us to deploy to the scene then we will,’ he said. ‘We are investigating this burglary.’ He added that the call centre worker who told Mr Inkley an officer would not be available has subsequently been ‘spoken to’.","Mike Inkley told it would take two days for police to record details of raid on his cricket club .

To quote Guard 1003, pointing at . my wheelchair, “those things aren't allowed on these trains, they will . damage the floors”. ‘I couldn't quite believe what I heard and asked him to repeat it, which he did. ‘Reminding . myself this was 2012, not 1912, this was public transport and this was . the year the Paralympics were coming to Britain, the red mist was . descending. ‘Expanding his . fictional list of reasons why I could not travel, he then said, if he . got me on this train, there was no guarantees I could get off three . minutes later (at) the same station I had successfully travelled from . earlier that morning. ‘Trying . to intimidate me, he said I might have to stay on the train to .

Determined: Geoff Holt competed in the Round Britain Adventure in a Challenger Trimaran despite being disabled in a swimming accident that left him handicapped . ‘And with that simple, easy manoeuvre, which took him only 10 seconds, I was on the train, Guard 1003 snarling at me like some prison guard.

After more than a week of mystery and intrigue surrounding the Maryland Mega Millions jackpot, it appears that we have a winner, but who is it? The holder of the winning ticket, sold in a Milford Mill 7-Eleven store has claimed their share of the record-breaking $656million prize today, but will remain anonymous. Maryland Lottery spokeswoman Carole Everett said that the winner claimed the prize at lottery headquarters with a ticket matching all six numbers: 2-4-23-38-46 and the Mega Ball, 23. Mystery: The Milford, Maryland, 7-Eleven store is proudly displaying that they sold one of the winning tickets but the identity of the winner is not known . The winner will remain anonymous, but officials will share some details at a news conference Tuesday morning, she said. Maryland does not require lottery winners to be identified. The burning question emerging from the announcement is whether the big winner is McDonald's worker Mirlande Wilson, who grabbed headlines as well as outrage when she publicly announced that she had the winning ticket – and, despite entering the drawing with co-workers, was not sharing it. Ms Wilson told NBC that she gave all of her co-workers the copies of the tickets for the pool and the winning ticket was not among them. Mega bucks: The jackpot was the biggest in Mega Millions history, and the three winners - one each in Maryland, Illinois and Kansas - will each receive more than $218million before taxes . Instead she claims to have sent a friend to buy more tickets later that day and the winning one was among them. 'McDonald's don't have nothing to do with this,' she insisted. 'They don't have nothing to do with - they don't even know about it and they don't even have nothing to do with this. It's only us by ourself [sic].' She then went on to say it was in a safe place at an undisclosed location before saying it was at the McDonald’s in which she worked. She later claimed that she had lost it. She is leaving the discovery of the ticket in the hands of God: 'It’s a blessing from God. If it’s meant to be, we’ll [find and] claim the ticket'. Lost it: Mirlande Wilson said last week that she can't find the winning Mega Millions ticket but hasn't really looked for it properly and thinks God will help to find it if it's meant to be . Proof? Mirlande Wilson showed a reporter the copies of the pooled tickets she shared with her McDonald's employees and said the winning ticket was not among them - though would not say where it was . But the mother-of-seven's co-workers doubted her story was the truth. Another colleague told the New York Post: 'I don’t believe her. I didn’t believe her from the beginning, she’s always been strange. 'She’s an attention seeker. She likes to have all the attention on herself'. On her Facebook page, Ms Wilson has pledged to donate all of the winnings to rebuild her earthquake-devastated native Haiti. She wrote: 'All my true friend know im not greedy a person [sic] i don't want da money it made my life a living hell already im gonna give it all to rebuild haiti yall [sic] can chase all want my life and, my children it more important for money [sic]'. A McDonald's, divided: Mirlande Wilson said the winning ticket was at this McDonald¿s location where she worked before claiming that she had lost it . Ms Wilson’s attorney did not immediately return a call seeking comment Monday evening. The jackpot was the biggest in Mega Millions history, and the three winners - one each in Maryland, Illinois and Kansas - will each receive more than $218million before taxes. Kansas' winner claimed a share of the jackpot Friday, but also decided to remain anonymous. Lottery players waited in long lines to buy tickets as the jackpot gradually climbed, leaving millions of losers to grumble about their misfortune and dream of what they would have done with all that money. Maryland has been the home of Mega Millions winners in the past. In 2007, Ellwood ‘Bunky’ Bartlett won roughly $27million after taxes.

The filmmaker and studio behind documentary Bully, have declared victory after winning their battle to have the movie's rating lowered, allowing viewers as young as 13 years old to see it. Bully - which follows five teenagers and families who have been impacted by bullying - was originally given an R rating for language,  meaning . anyone under the age of 17 would not be able to see it. It became a heated issue between the Motion Picture Association of America and studio The Weinstein Company because the aim of the film is to show young people a closer look at the effects of bullying.

Fly on the wall: The film, follows five teenagers and their families who have been impacted by bullying such as 12-year Alex from Sioux City, Iowa who is relentlessly tormented on a daily basis . Difficulty viewing: In some harrowing scenes, Alex, who says he has difficulties making friends, is attacked on the school bus as well as being pushed and punched in other clips . Should 13 year old's be able to see Harvey Weinstein's harrowing movie Bully? Director Lee Hirsch said he was able to keep a key scene in the film for which he lobbied hard, but he edited out three uses of one certain word to appease the group that rates movies based on language, sex, violence and other content. 'I'm just glad that we held strong. I think this is a great resolution,' Hirsch told Reuters about his and distributor The Weinstein Co.'s battle with the Motion Picture Association (MPAA) of America's ratings board. 'We are getting so much interest to see the film, and this makes it much easier for schools to get behind it.' Compromise: Director Lee Hirsch said he was able to keep a key scene in the film for which he lobbied hard, but he edited out three uses of one certain word to appease the group that rates movies based on language, sex, violence and other content .

In the documentary his parents hit out at his school's 'indifference' Harvey Weinstein (pictured) and his brother are co-chairmen of film production company The Weinstein Co. The documentary, opened in New York and Los Angeles last weekend to a strong $23,000 per screen average at box offices, and the new 'PG-13' rating from the MPAA should widen its audience appeal when it expands across the United States on April 13. Weinstein Co. marketing chief Stephen Bruno said many church groups, school groups and youth organizations had been inquiring about the movie's content, and he hoped that more of them now come to see the film. The MPAA ranks movies to give audiences an idea of the content within any given film. Their decision was based on the use of one certain curse word that is used six times in the movie - if it features more than once it automatically results in an 'R'. But Hirsch had argued that the language was a reflection of real life: 'It's what the children who are victims of bullying face on most days.' Hirsch and Weinstein initially lobbied the MPAA'S ratings board to change its mind, arguing that it will exclude the very people on whom it would have the most impact - young people. But Hirsch refused to change his movie, and the MPAA refused to budge, too. Last weekend, it went out unrated, but even that distinction limits a movie's play in some theaters and to some groups. A compromise was reached when Hirsch . agreed to edit out three uses of the particular word, and the MPAA . agreed to allow one key scene in which one of the film's subjects is . beaten on a school bus and the word is used three times. 'We . retained the central scene and all three (words) are intact. The whole . scene is intact and that ... was a great victory for me,' Hirsch said.

An eight-year-old boy was killed yesterday after being run over by a 4x4 towing a trailer at his family's farm. Charles Kimm was playing in the grounds of the farm, Wyndales Lodge in Symington, south Lanarkshire, when he was struck by the vehicle as it reversed through a gate. His father, Robert, 56, is believed to have been driving the vehicle at the time. Despite the efforts of paramedics who rushed to Charles' aid by helicopter, the schoolboy was declared dead at the scene. Charles Kimm, eight, died after he was apparently hit by a reversing car at Wyndales Lodge, Symington . Charles lived at the farm with his . parents Robert and Suzanne, and his two sisters, who were yesterday . being comforted by family members. Mr Kimm, keeps horses and chickens on . the farm and is a breeder of English pointer dogs. He also runs till . suppliers Strathclyde Cash Registers, which is used by a number of local . businesses, from his home. Several police officers attended at the farm following the incident just before 3pm on Thursday but it is being treated as a tragic accident. Today Charles' parents were too upset to comment but a family spokesman said they had been left 'devastated' by what had happened. They also released a photograph of him posing proudly next to his mini motorbike. Children's toys lay abandoned in the front garden of the home while blinds and curtains remained drawn. Several vehicles could also be seen parked outside the property. Shocked neighbours described the tragic schoolboy as being 'lovely' and 'care-free'. Tom Robertson, 76, who stays next door to the Kimms, said: 'It's quite a hard thing for me to talk about, it's awful. 'I heard about what happened yesterday afternoon and it's a total tragedy. I know them as neighbours and they were very nice neighbours. The family are just your average, happy normal family.'

'I hope that God is with them over the coming days because I'm sure they are going to need him.' Kim Adam, 54, who runs Feufield animal sanctuary near the farm, added: 'I was outside and I heard the helicopter coming in and landing in the next field. 'At first I didn't think anything of it as Army Chinooks fly over here all the time, but when it came down I realised something was wrong. 'When I found out that he had died I was shocked, it is absolutely tragic. I have seen the little boy out in the garden, I can't imagine what the family must be going through.' A full investigation into the accident is to be carried out by the Health and Safety Executive. A Strathclyde Police spokeswoman said: 'It appears the car was reversing through a gate when the young boy was struck by the vehicle. 'The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 01:04 EST, 11 April 2012 . An Old West gun battle re-enactor in South Dakota who wounded three onlookers when he fired live rounds instead of blanks has been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. Paul Doering was taken into custody immediately upon sentencing at federal court in Rapid City on Monday. Doering, 49, a six-time convicted felon, told the court he ‘panicked’ and has ‘gone over this a million and a-half times, trying to figure out how I let this happen.’ He had faced up to 20 years in prison. End of the road: The Hill City shootout was performed by the Dakota Wild Bunch Re-enactors, who have called time on the gun fights in light of the incident . The Big Joint: The Old West re-enactor was sentenced Monday to seven and a half years in federal prison . The re-enactor pleaded guilty in January to a charge of tampering in a plea deal with prosecutors. Under the deal, prosecutors dropped the original charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Doering admits in court documents that he tried to hide two guns and ammunition after the June 17 shooting in Hill City. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Kelderman told the court: ‘None of this would have happened if the defendant would have complied with the law,’ the Rapid City Journal reported. The three tourists were hit during the June 17 re-enactment staged by the Dakota Wild Bunch, who usually use blanks when performing several times a week on a street in Hill City, a tourist town in South Dakota's Black Hills. The show has now been suspended. The bullets shattered a leg bone of Carrol Knutson, 65, of Birchwood, Minnesota; hit the forearm and elbow of John Ellis, 48, an optometrist from South Connellsville, Pennsylvania; and caused minor injuries to Jose Pruneda, 53, of Alliance, Nebraska. Criminal record: Doering is a six-time convicted felon . Horror: Blood from one of the victims pools in the street where the shootout happened . Scene: The event took place on the corner of Main St and Elm St, in Hill City, South Dakota . Investigators will not say why the incident happened, but Hill City Administrator Brett McMacken said it appeared to have been accidental. The mock shootouts between lawmen and outlaws, sponsored by the Hill City Chamber of Commerce, have been held in the town in front of crowds of around 160 people for at least 20 years. The Dakota Wild Bunch has been doing the show, which has since been suspended, for four years. Investigators found Doering had served more than five years in Minnesota prisons on multiple felony convictions. Aftermath: Pennington County deputies question a member of the shootout . But South Dakota law prohibits convicted criminals from possessing or having control of a firearm for 15 years. He served 14 months for two first-degree assault convictions in the early 1980s, according to John Schadl of the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Victim: Carrol Knutson, 65, from Birchwood, Minnesota was one of three people shot in a Wild West-style shootout in South Dakota . He returned to prison in 1990 after he was convicted of second-degree burglary. While serving a 14-month sentence, he was charged with escape and ordered to serve additional time. Doering then went back to prison in 2000 and late 2001 after he was convicted of fleeing from law enforcement. His lengthy criminal history includes numerous arrests for traffic violations and at least one conviction for driving with more than the legal limit of alcohol in his system. Court records also show that Doering pleaded guilty to violating a protection order in 2004. He was placed on probation and was only released from probation in April 2010. Authorities said they did not know whether background checks were carried out on the re-enactors. George Heywood Jr, of Hill City, was once a part of the shootout re-enactments, and said many residents were not fans. He said: 'Certain people in Hill City have never cared for it. At one time, it was really neat.' Heywood said local support for the shootout has declined as new people joined the business district, and there was much more control over the shootout when local businessmen were actively involved in the performances. He added: 'I think they had a lot more into it, so safety meant more than when you have someone hired or brought in that no one really knows.' When asked about Doering's criminal record, he said: 'I think that’s a big mistake by somebody. Whoever’s in charge of that group, that’s definitely a big mistake.'","Paul Doering, 49, used live ammunition instead of blanks in staged gun battle last year .

Fleeing the UK weather is nothing news - cavemen sat out the Ice Age on the shores of the Med, research shows. New DNA analysis has shown how humans sheltered from the Ice Age in warmer climates in Southern France and East Asia, where they remained until worst of the cold snap finally lifted 20,000 years ago. It had been known there were two safe havens for humans as the Ice Age reached its peak 26,000 years ago - the ‘Franco-Cantabrian’ area, roughly coinciding with northern Spain and southern France, and the ‘Periglacial province’ on the Ukrainian plains. Now researchers say another group sat out the ice age in East Asia in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. This helps explain mitochrondial DNA in modern Europeans from two lineages, J and T, which originated in the Middle East. Until recently it was thought these lines migrated to Europe in the Neolithic age, approximately 9,000 years ago. However, the new research suggests that humans belonging to the J and T haplogroups actually migrated to Europe 19,000 years ago - allowing them to repopulate Europe when the Ice Age drew to a close. Dr Maria Pala, of the University of Huddersfield, said: ‘The end of the Last Glacial Maximum (Ice Age) allowed people to recolonise the parts of Europe that had been deserted and this expansion allowed increase of human populations.’ The Mediterranean: New DNA analysis has shown how humans sheltered from the Ice Age in warmer climates in Southern France and East Asia, where they remained until worst of the cold snap finally lifted 20,000 years ago .

Writing for the American Journal of Human Genetics, she said: ‘It helps us to reevaluate the perception of our identity. ‘We are highly focussed on identifying ourselves as Italians, British or whatever, but by analysing DNA we discover that originally, not such a long time ago, we came from a common source.’","DNA shows humans sheltered in southern Europe .

The 43-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of theft from Foxcote Manor in Andoversford, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Leyshon took eight glass vases, a glass bowl, a rug, three table lanterns and a bottle of vodka belonging to the owner of the property, Tamara Vestey. He also took Lady Bathurst’s bag worth about £500, which containing the valuable silver cigarette case. Another handbag valued at about £500 was stolen from guest Alexa Newton. Prosecutor Derek Ryder said: 'The defendant had come to the ball with his then partner who was driving the car, and when the car left it contained the handbags and other items from the ball such as the vases, lanterns and rug.

Today, most of Sahar Gul’s terrible wounds have healed, her hair and nails have grown back, and she has ambitions to be a doctor or a lawyer. But as three people were jailed for ten years each for their part in her torture, the 15-year-old broke her public silence to demand a harsher sentence. She described how her life had been destroyed by her husband – who is still on the run – and his family and said that she would never have peace until she had left Afghanistan. 'Ten years is not enough, they should be given 50 years,' Sahar said. 'They should be punished in prison. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sahar Gul has made a remarkable recovery since she was rescued after neighbours heard her tortured cries . Sahar plays with a doll at a refuge centre for women who have suffered abuse . When her abusers electrocuted her feet, Sahar though she was going to die . 'They hurt my eyes and pulled out my nails and hair and the same should . be done to them.

The government is trying its best to . find my husband; convicted but on the run. 'But if tomorrow, if he finds me, it's possible he could kill me.' When she was first pictured in her hospital bed she appeared small and withdrawn. But now she appears to have put on more weight and the scars that were left on her body have all but disappeared. During the court case against her husband and his family, it was said that the beatings at a . house in northern Baghlan province started because Sahar had refused to . become a prostitute. She believes that the 10-year prison sentences weren't long enough and wants to see them treated the same way as they treated her . Sahar was forced to marry at the age of 15 and raped by her husband, but because she didn't become pregnant they started torturing her with the intention of eventually making her become a prostitute . It was only when neighbours heard her pained cries . that authorities were alerted to what was going on. '[My husbands family] told me to go to the basement because there are some guests coming to the house,' she told CNN. 'When I went there the came in and tied my hands and feet and pulled me upwards from above. They brought very little food for me, while going to the bathroom they used to beet me a lot. I was crying all the time. 'When they put electric shocks in my feet I felt like I was going to die at that moment. I screamed and that was how our neighbours realised there was something happening. 'For one day and night I was unconscious, feeling dead.' While Sahar has clearly made a remarkable physical recovery, the mental scars will no doubt last for years. She wants to escape from Afghanistan, but remains hopeful for her future. 'I want to go abroad,' she said. 'If I stay here they will find me. I want to go to school and become a doctor or a persecutor so I can give punishment by myself to these people.' Cruel: Sahar Gul was brutally tortured by her husband's family. The 15-year-old was burned with cigarettes and had chunks of her flesh cut out with pliers . Disgusting: Sahar Gul's in-laws pulled out her nails and hair, and locked her in a dark basement bathroom for about five months, with barely enough food and water to survive . Her husband's family also burned the teenager with cigarettes and cut out chunks of her flesh with pliers. Following the ordeal, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai said those responsible would be punished and despite being barely able to speak, Miss Gul managed to tell media about the terrifying ordeal. 'For several months I was locked up in a toilet by my in-laws and . particularly my mother-in-law,' she said. 'I was denied food and water. I was tortured and beaten.' Doctors say the youngster has suffered both mentally and physically and will need weeks of treatment in order to recover. 'She was married seven months ago, and was originally from Badakhshan province. Her in-laws tried to force her into prostitution to earn money,' Rahima Zarifi, head of women's affairs in Baghlan told Reuters. Upsetting: Sahar Gul was kept in a terrible condition by her husband's family, who tortured and beat her . Dreadful: Sahar Gul's appalling physical condition shortly after she was rescued can be seen in this image . Distressing: This picture shows how frail the teenager was when taken into hospital following her rescue . Miss Gul was covered in scars and bruises, with one eye still swollen shut six days after her rescue. 'This is one of the worst cases of violence against Afghan women. The perpetrators must be punished so others learn a lesson,' health minister Suraya Dalil told journalists after visiting Sahar. Action needed: Afghanistan's acting minister of public health Suraya Dalil, left, and the caretaker minister for women's affairs Dr Husn Banu Ghazanfar visit Sahar Gul in hospital . Recovery: Sahar Gul was treated in a government hospital in Kabul, but doctors have said she may have to be sent to India . Despite progress in women's rights and freedom since the fall of the Taliban 10 years ago, women throughout the country are still at risk of abduction, rape, forced marriage and being traded as commodity. However it can be hard for women to escape violent situations at home, because of huge social and sometimes legal pressure to stay in marriages. Running away from an abusive husband or a forced marriage are considered 'moral crimes,' for which women are currently imprisoned in Afghanistan. Some rape victims have also been imprisoned, because sex outside marriage, even when the woman is forced, is considered adultery, another 'moral crime.'","Sahar Gul was forced into a marriage when she was just 15 but endured months of torture after she failed to become pregnant .

Vega then chimes in saying: ‘You can’t help who you love.’ Vega and her boyfriend, who now have two children together, were going through a rocky patch when she told him she was battling leukemia and had six months to live. O’Connell immediately took her back and the couple planned their dream wedding. Explaining herself: Vega said that she told the lie to get O'Connell, the father of her two children, back . In 2010, Vega spread the word in her . Hudson Valley community that she was dying of leukemia and wanted a . 'dream wedding' in the few months she had left. Donors stepped up with rings, an . embroidered wedding dress and a time-share in Aruba for the honeymoon. Other contributions included food, wine and hairdressing. Friends and strangers donated more than $13,000 for the couple’s wedding and Caribbean honeymoon. Vega was living in Montgomery, a town . 60 miles north of New York City, when she launched the scam, which . picked up steam when her story was featured in a local newspaper, the . Times Herald-Record of Middletown. But after their May 2010 wedding, O'Connell came to the newspaper with questions about her story and the couple divorced. As the truth emerged, Vega was arrested and, after pleading guilty to charges of fraud last April, she was imprisoned for 50 days. Speaking out for the first time since being released from jail last month, Vega told ABC that she concocted her cancer, where she showed O’Connell a doctor’s letter and even cut her hair to make it more convincing, to get him back. Living it up: Bride and groom enjoy their wedding which was paid for family, friends and kind strangers saddened by the story . Asked if she couldn’t get his attention another way, Vega simply said: ‘I’m the mother of his children and he would not call me.’ The ploy worked – Vega immediately moved back in with O’Connell. Footage from the couple’s wedding shows how Vega even weaved the lies into her marriage vows. Choked up with emotion Vega stares at her groom: ‘I want you to know the day I’m no longer physically here I will always kiss you goodnight.’ In the interview Vega says she ‘had to mention’ her ‘cancer’ during the vows. The wedding video continues to show Vega dance the night away – a far cry from being riddled with guilt over her lies as she claims she was. ‘I regret what I did to people but I don’t know any female in [sic] the earth that would be depressed on their wedding day,’ she argued to ABC. Vega also says she had help with the fraud, as a friend forged the letters from doctors about her supposed treatments, which Vega then signed. Although Vega refused to disclose the accomplice’s name she said she was no longer friends with that person. Jailed: The 25-year-old is unlikely to do any time in state prison, but she will have to repay $13,368 to her victims and remain in jail until her sentencing on May 15 . Vega was arrested April 3 in Virginia, where she was again living with O'Connell and their second child. With the help of Vega's father the couple have now paid back the duped donors. During her sentencing hearing last month Vega's lawyer, Jeremiah Flaherty said Vega was sorry for what . happened and hoped the people who showed her kindness aren't . disillusioned or less likely to help others in the future. 'She got caught up in something and it just got out of hand,' Flaherty said.

Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, . whose office prosecuted the case, said the plea means Vega 'will be held . accountable for fleecing the public through lies and deception.' 'By pretending to have a terminal illness, Vega inexcusably took advantage of the community's hearts and minds,' he said. Vega married Michael O'Connell, the . father of her one-year-old daughter Lily, on May 2, 2010 and the couple . spent an exotic honeymoon in Aruba using donated plane tickets and a . villa. The reception . was attended by 60 family and friends who had all give money to the . tragic cause along with many strangers who read about Vega's plight in . their town newspaper in Newburgh, around 75 miles from New York City. Friends donated everything from her dress to a two-week honeymoon in the . Caribbean so that the then 23-year-old could enjoy a happy start to married . life before succumbing to the disease. She reportedly received thousands of dollars and wedding presents. Proud moment: Vega walked down the aisle as family and friends took photographs, duped into thinking she had terminal cancer . Big day of deception: New Yorker Jessica Vega told family and friends she had terminal cancer when she was 23 to scam them out of money to pay for a lavish wedding . Four months later, O'Connell revealed that Vega had been faking the illness and he had been duped into marrying her after she showed him a letter from her doctors with the grim diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. Within weeks of returning from their . honeymoon O'Connell, a construction worker, noticed that his wife's . condition had not deteriorated. He telephoned the doctor's office to ask questions about her cancer only to be told Vega was not a patient at the surgery. The letter she reportedly had obtained from a doctor in Westchester was a forgery. Scam: The couple picture signing their marriage license.

Deplorable: Sporting a cropped hairstyle, Vega . views wedding dresses before her big day on May 2, 2010 - after tricking her fiance by telling him she had less than a year to live . Paradise: Vega got a free honeymoon to Aruba which was donated by a stranger who took pity on her . The couple divorced over the . deception and O'Connell moved to Virginia to find work. Vega initially denied making up the cancer story and said at the time that she and her husband separated because he was physically abusive. The local newspaper reporter who wrote the initial report attempted to . accompany Vega to see her doctor but she failed to turn up for the . appointment. During the hearing O'Connell, who at one time gave evidence to prosecute his wife, said his wife needed mental health care and not prison.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld their objections. 'The ASA noted that the phrase ‘Sofa King Low’ used the advertiser’s company name but considered that it could be interpreted as a derivative of the swear word ‘f***’, which consumer research had found to be a word so likely to offend that it should not be used in ads at all, even when it was relevant to the name of a product,' the watchdog said.

British Gas today reported a 30 per cent slide in profits to £522million in the past year - despite putting up bills by a quarter since 2010. The energy giant claimed mild a spring and autumn had led to a drop in household gas consumption by more than a fifth and a 4 per cent cut in electricity use. But research by a consumer group showed the main reason people had gone without heating was the massive cost of energy, rather than the weather. Expensive: British Gas today reported a 30 per cent slide in profits - despite hiking gas prices by more than a quarter in recent years . British Gas hiked its prices in December 2010 and again in August 2011 by 24.9 per cent or £256 in total, pushing its average household bill up to £1,286 a year. It has since cut its electricity price by 5 per cent or £26, after losing 97,000 customers over the course of 2011. Despite the fall in profits by a nearly a third in its household energy arm, parent company Centrica still reported a 1 per cent increase in operating profits to £2.41billion. The company's upstream gas and oil . exploration business saw profits jump 33 per cent, thanks to higher . wholesale gas prices on world markets and good production performance. Elsewhere, . the fall in profits was clawed back through residential services such . as boiler repairs, where profits were 10 per cent higher at £264million. Source: uSwitch.com . Annual bill sizes based on a medium user profile on a standard plan. Customers using 3,300kWh and 16,500kWh gas, paying on receipt of bill with bill sizes averaged across all regions. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: 'People will be shocked that when millions of families are struggling with their energy bills, big energy companies like British Gas are enjoying huge profits. 'By letting the energy giants get away with this, the Government is showing it's out of touch and completely unable to stand up to powerful vested interests in the energy industry. 'Our energy market needs a complete overhaul, but David Cameron can only fiddle at the margins because he's too close to vested interests to stand up for working people.' British Gas blamed lower household energy consumption on milder winter weather, but other research indicated that hard-pressed consumers were willing to brave the cold rather to keep bills down. Centrica shares closed at 293.5p on the London Stock Exchange yesterday, valuing the business at £15.2billion. Adam Scorer, director of policy and external affairs at Consumer Focus, said the results showed that the energy industry is close to recession-proof. 'Healthy profits are still being made despite a big dip in consumption over our mild winter this year.' He added that consumers needed to be assured that the price they pay is continually fair, and that the competitive energy market is working in their interests. Home economics: uSwitch.com claims the cut to British Gas profits is down to hard-pressed customers turning down the heating to save cash . 'British Gas happens to be the most . open of all the big six firms. But as long as the market is not felt to . be fully transparent, consumers will continue to question every price . rise, every profit statement and every explanation as to why bills are . so high.' According to a survey from . uSwitch.com, 71 per cent cited the high cost of energy as the main . reason they have gone without heating this winter, compared to just . under a quarter who said weather was the main reason. British Gas claims it has invested £1.80 for every £1 it has earned over . the past five years. Its dividend for shareholders increased 8 per cent . to 15.4p a share. Chief . executive Sam Laidlaw said it had been a tough year, 'both for Centrica . and our customers', but that the company was still making the . investments 'on which Britain's energy future depends'. This graph shows meteoric rise in the price of energy from British Gas since 2004. Figures from uSwitch.com . However, Ann Robinson, Director of Consumer Policy at uSwitch.com, said: 'The important thing here is that the drop in residential profits is more than offset by an increase in profits at the wholesale end of the business. 'Against this background I suspect that many of its customers will  be even more disappointed that while their bills soared by £256 or 24.9 per cent as a result of two price hikes, the supplier has subsequently cut just its electricity price by £26 or 5 per cent. 'Affordability is already a huge concern and while British Gas has pointed to the mild winter weather as the reason why household consumption has fallen, our own research shows that people are turning down and switching off because of cost. 'Seven in ten (71 per cent) say that the main reason they have gone without heating this year is the high cost of energy rather than the mild weather (24 per cent) – this fact speaks for itself. 'I would urge all suppliers to acknowledge the pressure their customers are under and to cut their prices again. As Britain’s biggest supplier it would be great to see British Gas take the lead.' The 'Big Six' energy companies have faced continual accusations of profiteering as prices have pushed higher and higher. Regulator Ofgem last year appointed BDO, a firm of forensic accountants, to investigate accounting practices amid claims energy companies could be attempting to make their retail divisions appear less profitable. Last month BDO reported that the companies' accounting methodologies were broadly fair and appropriate.","Firm hiked gas prices by 24.9% between 2010 and the beginning of this year .

"By . Jason Groves . UPDATED: . 17:23 EST, 3 February 2012 . Bank bosses have been 'creaming it' at the expense of their shareholders over the last decade, the chairman of troubled Royal Bank of Scotland admitted yesterday. Sir Philip Hampton conceded that pay had been too high for too long, particularly in the investment banking sector. In an unusually frank admission he acknowledged that top bankers had 'creamed it' by hauling in high pay, while shareholders had received 'diddly squat' for ten years. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton (left) said bankers' pay is too high - after signing off a bonus worth almost a million pounds for bank boss Stephen Hester (right) However, he claimed the issues were . being 'corrected'. He also insisted the £1.2million salary of his chief . executive Stephen Hester was 'quite low' compared with other top . bankers. Earlier this week Mr Hester, who took . over as chief executive after the Government bailed out RBS in 2008, . agreed to waive a bonus worth almost £1million. Sir Philip said the bank had . 'underestimated the scale of the public reaction' to the payouts. However, he pointed out that Mr Hester held 'one of the most challenging . and demanding jobs in world business'. Labour leader Ed Miliband said banking . had to change, and insisted the party's attacks on bonuses were not . motivated by the 'politics of envy'. Mr Hester, who took over as chief executive after the Government bailed out the near-bankrupt RBS in 2008, was doing a ‘great job’ in turning the bank around and protecting the taxpayer’s 83 per cent investment in the business, he said. Sir Philip, who himself turned down a £1.4million bonus earlier this month, confirmed that he had signed off Mr Hester’s proposed package of £963,000 worth of RBS shares - which was 60 per cent of the maximum he could have received under a performance-related scheme. Ed Miliband warned bankers yesterday they must wave goodbye to their culture of 'excessive' bonuses and reconnect with the rest of the country. In a speech in London's Canary Wharf financial district, the Labour leader (pictured) urged a return to 'one nation banking' which would serve the wider economy and society. Mr Miliband told the bankers in his audience at the Thomson Reuters Building that they needed to reflect 'the values of Britain'. 'We cannot have a banking sector so divorced from the rest of the economy and the rest of society,' he said. 'We succeed or fail together. It is not about the politics of envy, it is about a culture of responsibility. 'We need what you might call ""one nation banking"". We need banks that serve the real economy. We need banking serving every region, every sector, every business, every family in this country. 'And we need banks run in a way that people believe are consistent with their values - the values of Britain.' He added: 'Responsibility means ending the culture of excessive bonuses.' The Labour leader warned of a return to 'two nations', the description of 19th century Britain used by Victorian Conservative prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. The banking and financial sector was on a path of 'gradual separation from the rest of society', he said. Mr Miliband said banks, effectively underwritten by the taxpayer, could not be 'immune' from public debate. 'This is a call on banking to recognise that it should take the path of change, to recognise that it is not isolated from the economy or society,' he said. In a question and answer session following his speech, Mr Miliband said the public sector must set 'the best example' when it comes to high pay, as he pressed ministers to reveal who signed off the tax arrangements of Student Loans Company boss Ed Lester. Earlier in the week, it was revealed Mr Lester was paid through a separate company, which enabled him to avoid paying thousands of pounds in tax. Mr Miliband also criticised six-figure bonuses at Network Rail. He said: 'If politicians are going to be concerned about what are seen as excessive bonuses in the banking sector, I think we should be equally concerned with organisations like Network Rail."" He added: 'I think there are really unanswered questions here about what was going on at the Student Loans Company. And there continues to be a question of whether income tax and National Insurance is going to be paid. 'All us have to understand that times are different and it is particularly important that the public sector sets the best example it can. These aren't just issues for the banking sector, these are issues which are broader as well.' But he denied that he had been swayed . by Government pressure to keep the bonus under £1 million and said that . it was Hester himself who decided to give up the payout in order to . protect his own reputation and that of the bank. 'The decision in relation to Stephen . Hester’s bonus was made by the remuneration committee and recommended to . the board,' he said. 'We . took account of shareholders’ contributions, but we never had the sense . that there was an arbitrary minimum or maximum. We made an evaluation . of his performance.' Sir Philip acknowledged that RBS got . its presentation wrong: 'I think it is true that we under-estimated the . scale of the public reaction to the bonus award. 'I . think probably, in hindsight, having Stephen Hester as the focal point . of public concern about these things, being the first to be scrutinised . in this way, was wrong. 'We . did that essentially because there was so much speculation, we thought . the speculation itself was damaging and decided to try to end the . speculation by making it plain.' Despite widespread speculation, the RBS board never threatened to resign over the bonus issue, said Sir Philip. Asked whether he now expected Mr Hester to walk away from his job, he acknowledged that intense scrutiny of his bonus had been 'challenging' for the chief executive, but described him as 'a tough character' who was 'dedicated to turning the business round'. Sir Philip told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'I think if this bank is fully returned to profitability by an able management team, that is very much in the interests of the British taxpayer. Stephen Hester and his team are, I think, doing a great job. 'I recognise absolutely that some of the pay levels are very high, very difficult for people to understand, but by the standards of this market they are not high.' Sir Philip acknowledged public unease about the scale of rewards across the financial sector. 'Pay has been high for too long, particularly in the banks, particularly in the investment banks,' he said. 'Shareholders have done pretty badly and employees have done pretty well over the last 10 years. 'That needs to be corrected. It isn’t a society or fairness issue, it is a straightforward business issue. Too much of the money is not going to the right place and the shareholder rewards have not been sufficient. 'I think that is in the process of changing now. It’s perhaps not changing as quickly as many would like, but it is changing, pay is falling in this industry and has been falling in recent years. 'At some stage, there will be a business correction to bring banker pay properly in line with underlying performance of the business.' But he added that being unable to attract the best staff would damage the performance of the bank, which was worth £900million to the Treasury for every penny increase in its share price. 'I do think it is very important that it is recognised that Stephen Hester has one of the most challenging, demanding jobs - literally - in world business,' he said. 'This is a huge bank, absolutely vital to the British economy, systemically important to the world financial system. 'It got into a terrible mess. Stephen Hester and his team were brought in to sort that mess out. 'Although their pay is very high in absolute terms, in relative terms to other bankers and top businessmen generally, it is not particularly high. In fact by most measures, it is quite low. 'Whilst I understand this concern, I also know we have got to live in a competitive marketplace and if we don’t get this enormous financial institution run by the best people, then we won’t be doing the right job for the British taxpayer.' Sir Philip described how Mr Hester came to the decision last weekend to give up his bonus. 'Stephen and I discussed the public reaction at some length and he concluded after that conversation that the reputational considerations both to himself and the bank meant that the best course now was to waive it,' he said. Sir Philip declined to comment on the . decision to strip former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin of his . knighthood, telling Today: 'I think these things, from the point of view . of the bank, should be consigned to history.'","Sir Philip Hampton admitted bank’s board 'under-estimated' the public outrage the bonus would provoke .

A British man has been arrested in Germany for allegedly stealing rhino horns worth nearly £50,000 from museums to sell on for use in traditional Chinese medicine. The man, who has not yet been named but who reportedly comes from north London, was one of a trio of Britons stopped in a stolen car at a police checkpoint in Munich. It is understood that he may have links to an organised crime gang operating out of Dublin. Museum thefts: The preserved black rhino from the Cron hunting trophy collection at the Museum im Ritterhaus in Offenburg after its horns were robbed . While he and his suspected accomplices sit in preventative detention, police continue to try to ascertain if they have been involved in other rhino horn thefts on the continent. 'The person who is strongly under suspicion is accused of having been involved in the theft of the horns in February in the German city of Offenburg,' said police. Police said two people distracted staff at the Offenburg museum while another two climbed on the display case and removed a rhino head from a wall to smash off the horn with hammers. Investigations into the possible role of the other two UK citizens in the robbery are continuing and all three remain in custody. The hunt goes on for the fourth man. Museums across Europe have recently been targeted by rhino horn thieves as populations of the animals diminish more and more in the wild. The horn is ground down for usage in many Chinese medicaments, most famously to make an alleged aphrodisiac which, scientists say, has no effect. A single horn can capable of fetching close to £200,000 on the black market. China and Vietnam are the main markets. Audacious: Two robbers distracted the museum staff while two others rushed over to the rhino head mounted on a display 13ft high and broke off the horns . The Offenburg museum was targeted on February 18. Four thieves entered the museum during broad daylight. Two of them distracted the museum staff and the two others rushed over to the rhino head mounted on a display 13ft high. Officials at Europol, the European Union's criminal intelligence agency, say the number of thefts of rhinoceros horns has increased sharply in Europe during the past year. Since 2011, the agency has recorded 56 successful and 10 attempted thefts. Criminals purloined horns from museums and private collections in 15 countries, with many of the thefts believed to be linked to 'an Irish and ethnically Irish organised criminal group, who are known to use intimidation and violence to achieve their ends.' Europol spokesman Soren Pedersen said the increase in crimes may also be linked to a rumour that rhinoceros horns can cure cancer. But scientists have not found the horn, which is ingested in powdered form, to be of any medical benefit. 'You'd get the same effect by chewing your fingernails,' said Nigel Monaghan, keeper of the National Museum of Ireland. Chinese medicine: The rhino horns are ground down and used for a variety of remedies, but are especially prized as an aphrodisiac . Norbert Niedernostheide of the German Museums Association said he knew of ten cases in Europe in the past 12 months where horns have been stolen from zoos, private collections and museums. In Germany, Bamberg's Museum of Natural History installed extra security after a thief broke into the facility last summer and used a screwdriver to prize open the display case containing the museum's only wide-mouthed rhinoceros horn. In their natural habitats in Africa and Asia, fewer than 30,000 rhinoceroses still roam in the wild today. Javan rhinos, with a population of just under 50, are under particular threat of extinction.","Unidentified suspect said to come from north London .

In good nick: This 1909 baseball card depicting Hall of Fame legend Honus Wagner could fetch up to $1.5million when it goes under the hammer . A 102-year-old baseball card described as one of the most sought-after sports collectibles in the world is expected to fetch up to $1.5million when it goes up for auction. St Louis resident Bill Goodwin, who has been in the collectibles business for a quarter of a century, says the 1909 Honus Wagner card he's putting up for sale is about as good as it gets. 'We deal with nice products, vintage stuff, but this is the ultimate,' said the 64-year-old, of Sunset Hills, Missouri, said. 'I can't see topping this, ever.' The card is owned by a Houston businessman who has declined to be identified. The online auction continues until April 19. The 2.5in by 1.5in baseball card was released in cigarette packs sold by the American Tobacco Co from 1909 to 1911. Wagner is a Hall of Famer and one of the greatest players of his era. Nicknamed 'The Flying Dutchman', he spent most of his 21-year career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, winning eight batting titles and hitting a career .327. But what makes the card special is that it was pulled from circulation after about 200 were issued. For years, the consensus was that Wagner didn't want to encourage smoking, especially to children. Goodwin noted, though, that Wagner was photographed with chewing tobacco in his mouth and did advertisements for tobacco companies. 'I, and some other people, think he just wanted to be paid,' Goodwin said. Historians believe about 60 of the 1909 Wagner cards still exist, but many are in poor condition. Based on a rating system by Sportscard Guarantee Corp, the quality of the card Goodwin is auctioning is better than all, but five of the Wagner cards in existence, he said. 'Ultimate': U.S. auctioneer Bill Goodwin holds the card, which he says is the best collectible he has ever come across in his 25 years in the trade . In 2011, Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick paid a record $2.8 million for the highest-graded Wagner card in existence. Goodwin's auction has been launched just in time for the start of the 2012 Major League Baseball season, which opens up tomorrow with a two-game series between the Seattle Mariners and Oakland Athletics in Japan's Tokyo Dome. The six-month campaign gets fully underway in MLB's home parks on April 4. Goodwin will start the bidding for his card at $300,000, but expects it to bring far more than that. 'I believe it will bring between $1.2 million and $1.5 million,' Goodwin said. Experts agree. One of the greatest: Wagner in action for the Pittsburgh Pirates during his 21-year career . 'Every time a Wagner goes up for auction it seems to go higher and higher and higher,' said Bob Snyder of Dave and Adam's Card World in Buffalo, N.Y., which claims to be the world's largest baseball card dealer. Frank Ceresi, a baseball historian whose FC Associates provides appraisals of sports collectibles, said the value of vintage sports memorabilia remains strong. 'Because of the Wagner mystique you can never overestimate the value in the market,' Ceresi said. 'When you get into the real rare, cool old stuff like a Wagner card, they come up so infrequently that you never know where that price might go.' Goodwin is auctioning other rare 1909 baseball cards that also may bring in big dollars. That includes an Eddie Plank card that was also pulled from circulation, apparently because Plank wanted to be paid for his image. Plank is a Hall of Fame pitcher who won 326 games, mostly with the Philadelphia As, in a 17-year career that ended in 1917. Goodwin estimates the Plank card could be worth $300,000 to $500,000. He is also auctioning a Sherry Magee 'error' card. Magee was a good but not great player who hit .291 over 16 careers from 1904 to 1919, mostly with the Philadelphia Phillies. What made the card more valuable is the mistaken spelling of Magee's name as 'Magie.' That card could bring up to $50,000.","102-year-old collectible picturing Hall of Famer is in top condition .

In one of her more bizarre interviews as she tried to boost Mr Sarkozy's re-election hopes, Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy, 44, said that she is often in disguise 'literally as well as figuratively'. Asked if she considered being the First Lady a difficult job, she said: 'Not really. I've been, since the age of 20, well separated from my public image. 'It's greatly helped me that I've been a model and then a singer. If I hadn't had the experience of media exposure, that would have been harder. 'Notoriety does not weight heavily on me, and then I disguise myself literally as well as figuratively. 'With a wig, nobody recognises me on the Metro. Recently, my bag was still searched on a visit to the Marine Museum.'

Crushed to death: Gary Whiting, 51, died immediately when a co-worker switched on a machine he was inside . Arms maker BAE Systems is facing a fine of at least £100,000 after admitting responsibility for the death of a worker crushed to death in a metal press. Gary Whiting, 51, died immediately from his injuries when a fellow worker switched on the press at BAE's Brough plant in East Yorkshire without realising he was still inside. Mr Whiting, who lived with wife Jacqueline in nearby east Hull, had worked at the company for 21 years. He was due to retire the following year. At Hull Crown Court yesterday, BAE Operations Limited admitted health and safety breaches led to the maintenance man's death on November 10, 2008. In court, a specialist inspector from the Health and Safety Executive condemned the firm for failing to implement measures that could have avoided the tragedy. In particular, investigators were concerned that the press could be turned on while a person was inside. At the time of the tragedy, Mr Whiting had been working as part of a four-strong maintenance team, tasked with servicing the machine. The jury at the inquest was told the recognised 'safe system' of working involved checking if anyone was in the machine, and shouting to one another, before turning it on. However, John Moutrie, a specialist HSE inspector, criticised the system that was in place for workers using the machine. He explained that a safer system of working would be using ISO Locks, where each member of the team has a padlock to place on the machine if they are going inside. This would eliminate the risk of a worker turning on a machine, not knowing a colleague is inside, he said. Richard Lissack QC, representing BAE, said: 'The company accepts it failed to take all reasonable and practical steps to care for the safety of this man who died in this awful accident.' He added that the company accepted they could have had 'physical control methods' that could have been used to avoid Mr Whiting’s death. Entrance to BAe Brough Plant: This entrance is situated on Saltgrounds Road . The QC extended BAE's condolences to the Whiting family, saying: 'Mr Whiting was a valued and popular workman and highly experienced. 'His death was truly shocking, in the truest sense of the word, to those who knew and liked him for many years.' Mr Whiting was a member of both East Hull Harriers and Athletics Club and Holderness Bowling Club and loved his job, according to his family. Speaking after the inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death, they said they did not believe Mr Whiting was at fault as he was not told the machine was about to be turned on. They also made clear they do not hold Alan Abbott, who turned the machine on, to blame. In a statement, they said: 'The family do not hold the operator of the press, nor indeed any other individual, personally responsible for Gary’s death.' Judge Michael Mettyear adjourned sentencing until a date in June. Earlier this year BAE announced it was shutting down its Brough plant, ending more than 100 years of manufacturing at the site.","Firm criticised for health and safety failures .

Announcement: Director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer (above) said the CPS is considering the cases of 11 suspects in the phone-hacking probe . Eleven suspects have been referred to prosecutors by Scotland Yard's phone-hacking squad, it was revealed today. Four files relating to four journalists, one police officer and six other individuals are being considered, director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer QC said. Offences under consideration include misconduct in a public office, data protection act breaches, perverting the course of justice, witness intimidation and breaches of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa). Mr Starmer refused to give a timescale for a charging decision, but said: 'We are now entering a period where we are likely to make a decision one way or another.' Some of the suspects referred to in the files have not been questioned by police yet, the DPP said. A total of 43 people arrested under the various operations sparked by disclosures of phone-hacking at the News of the World remained on bail, Mr Starmer added. The announcement came as Britain's top prosecutor published guidelines setting out how journalists may have broken the law. Mr Starmer said the new rules would help lawyers with the 'very difficult decisions'. Ongoing probe: Among the cases handed over by Scotland Yard's phone-hacking squad include those of four journalists and one police officer . 'The decisions we are going to make are going to be extremely difficult and extremely sensitive,' he said. 'We have got to make a decision because these cases are coming. We cannot duck that.' The four files include: . Mr Starmer said: 'These just happen to be the four files we have got, there may be others. We don't know.' He said the files relate to four investigations being carried out at the Metropolitan Police: Weeting, Elveden, Kilo and Sasha. Previously questioned: Former News International chief Rebekah Brooks (left) and ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson (right) have both been arrested during police investigations into phone hacking . The new guidelines will help prosecutors come to a charging decision when weighing up the allegations against the public interest. Scotland Yard's wide-ranging investigation into phone-hacking and corruption has led to the arrest of 46 people so far - with three told they face no further action. Since a fresh inquiry was launched in January last year, there have been 22 Weeting-led arrests, 23 Elveden-led arrests and three Tuleta-led arrests. Former News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and Rebekah Brooks, the former News International chief executive, have been held several times for different offences. Former editor of the News of the World and Prime Minister David Cameron's ex-communications director, Andy Coulson, has also been held. Under Operation Kilo - the inquiry into police leaks from Operation Weeting - Guardian reporter Amelia Hill was questioned last year under caution. Also held: Ex News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck (left) has been arrested several times, while Guardian reporter Amelia Hill (right) was questioned last year under Operation Kilo, the inquiry into leaks from Operation Weeting . Ms Hill, the paper's special investigations correspondent, is understood to have been the only journalist questioned under Operation Kilo last autumn. A 51-year-old detective who worked under Operation Weeting was arrested in relation to the allegation on August 19 last year. Mr Thurlbeck, who also been held on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications, is believed to be the only suspect held on suspicion of witness intimidation. He is accused of publishing personal details about a News International executive on his online blog. A CPS spokeswoman said later: 'We are not prepared to discuss the identities of those involved or the alleged offences in any greater detail at this stage as a number of related investigations are ongoing. 'We are unable to give any timescale for charging decisions, except to say that these cases are being considered very carefully and thoroughly, and the decisions will be made as soon as is practicable.' Under fire: News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch (above) closed down the News of the World last July over the phone-hacking scandal . The new guidelines state that the offence of misconduct in a public office carries a maximum jail term of life. Unlawful interceptions of communications carry sentences of two years behind bars. Mr . Starmer said: 'Freedom of expression and the public right to know about . important matters of public debate are an essential foundation of our . society - but there are limits for those who cross the line into . criminality. 'These guidelines will assist prosecutors in striking the right balance between those interests in cases affecting the media. 'Journalists, . and those who work with them, are not afforded special status under the . criminal law, but the public interest served by their actions is a . relevant factor in deciding whether they should be prosecuted in an . individual case.' Mr Starmer added that the rules would have helped lawyers come to swifter conclusions in the past. He raised allegations against journalists regarding the parliamentary expenses scandal as an example where lawyers were right not to make charges. Mr Starmer said: 'These guidelines will ensure consistency but will also provide openness and transparency to the public on what victims can expect, and to the media on the approach that prosecutors will take when considering such cases. 'This is an issue of great public concern and I want to give everyone who is interested a chance to give their views on what prosecutors will consider.' The report requires prosecutors to consider the European Convention of Human Rights' assertion on the use of confidential sources. 'That does not mean that prosecutions should never be brought where journalists may have to disclose their sources, but it does require prosecutors to give weight to the public interest in protecting journalist' sources when assessing whether the public interest served by the conduct in question outweighs the overall criminality,' the guidelines say. The investigations grew out of revelations that journalists at the News of the World routinely intercepted voice mails of those in the public eye. News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch closed down the 168-year-old tabloid in July and the scandal triggered a judge-led public inquiry into media ethics. Metropolitan Police figures showed that there were 829 potential victims of phone hacking, of whom 231 were said to be uncontactable. The scandal has also forced the resignation of Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and his assistant John Yates.","11 suspects referred to the CPS , says chief prosecutor .

If madcap art was an Olympic sport, Britain would be there on the podium claiming gold, silver and bronze. From carting a plane fuselage around Wales, to felling a forest for an immigrant-only football match, to sailing a chunk of Norway to the south coast of England; the nation’s artists have excelled themselves in their attempts to celebrate the London Games. Mind you, they have had some help – £5.4million of taxpayers’ cash to be exact. Cleared for take-off: Mark Rees's DC-9 fuselage will tour a number of Welsh towns. The artist says people will come to associate the memory of seeing the plane with the Olympics . The artists have been given up to £500,000 each by the Arts Council to mark the Olympics in their region. But their projects were yesterday dismissed as ‘fripperies’. The idea for the football pitch was submitted by Craig Coulthard. Hundreds of trees will be chopped down in a commercial forest for a one-off amateur game. Under the rules, players must have taken up British citizenship after 2000 or have indefinite leave to remain in the country. German-born creator Mr Coulthard said: ‘The players will be among the most recent generation of new members of Scottish society and I want to celebrate their contribution to modern Scotland.’ It's a funny old game: A concept image of Craig Coulthard's idea, which will see hundreds of trees felled in a commercial forest to make room for a football pitch. The field will then host a one-off amateur game for immigrants . Welsh winner Mark Rees has spent his £500,000 on an abandoned fuselage of a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airliner, which he will take around the country on a trailer. He said: ‘The day that this kind of extraordinary wingless creature comes into town and is nesting there for a period will stick in people’s memories so the Olympic Games will be the aeroplane.’ In the South West of England, six tons of land from an island in the Norwegian Arctic will be loaded on to a boat and hauled back to Britain. It will then be floated off the south coast as a ‘travelling embassy’. Artist and green campaigner Alex Hartley has christened his project Nowhereisland. He said: ‘It makes you think about our identity as an island nation, what it is to compete for your country. I think Nowhereisland can act as a really powerful poetic metaphor for climate change without badgering and without compromising itself as a work of art.’ Moving mountains: Nowhereisland will see a six-ton piece of Norwegian land floated from Norway to Dorset. Artist Alex Hartley says it's a metaphor for climate change . The projects will be showcased this summer as part of the Cultural Olympiad, a programme of events to celebrate London 2012. But they have been condemned by the TaxPayers’ Alliance as a waste of public money. Emma Boon said: ‘These pointless fripperies are adding to the total bill for the Olympics at a time when we can least afford it.’ Tory MP Geoffrey Cox QC added: ‘This is an inappropriate time for people to witness the expenditure of over half a million pounds on projects that may seem to those who are undergoing austerity a frivolous use of money.’ Other installations that have been given the go-ahead include the Lionheart Project which will feature the world’s largest crocheted lions. London’s project asks the public to submit artistic messages to be played on small screens on the top of bus shelters across the capital. Among the images showcased on its website is a hypodermic needle in an arm. Arts Council England is funding nine of the 12 projects, while the regional equivalents will fund those in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The National Lottery has also donated.

Egypt's Supreme Court has ordered for the country's parliament to be dissolved after ruling that its election six months ago was unconstitutional. The country's top court said a third of the Islamist-dominated legislature was elected illegally and new elections will have to be held. In it's ruling, the court said that 'the makeup of the entire chamber is illegal and, consequently, it does not legally stand.' The Egyptian parliament has been ordered to be dissolved by the Supreme Court . There was a heavy military presence outside the court as judges announced that Ahmed Shafik could stand for presidential election run-off . The explanation was carried by Egypt's official news agency and confirmed to The Associated Press by one of the court's judges, Maher Sami Youssef. The ruling means that new elections for the entire parliament will have to be held. The law governing the parliamentary elections, held over a three-month period starting in November, was ruled unconstitutional by a lower court because it breached the principle of equality when it allowed party members to contest a third of seats set aside for independents. The remaining two thirds were contested by party slates. Hosni Mubarak's health has continued to decline since the former dictator was sentenced more than two weeks ago. Whe was jailed for life for failing to stop the killing of hundreds of demonstrators as his regime crumbled around him during last year's Arab Spring. Security officials said Mubarak's two sons, one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were by his side at the intensive care ward of Torah prison hospital, south of Cairo. Mubarak ruled Egypt for almost 30 years, but his authoritarian regime was overthrown in February last year after tens of thousands of protesters demonstrated in Cairo's Tahrir Square and elsewhere. Demonstrators returned to the square last week after Mubarak was jailed for life but cleared of corruption. In a separate ruling, the court said Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, could stay in the presidential race, rejecting a law passed by parliament last month that barred prominent figures from the old regime from running for office. Shafiq will go head-to-head on Saturday and Sunday in a runoff against Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's strongest political group. The ruling said the legislation was . not based on 'objective grounds' and 'constitutes a violation of the . principle of equality,' leading to discrimination on 'illogical . grounds.' The Brotherhood . stands to lose the most by the rulings since it controls just under half . of all seats in the legislature and is likely not to do as well in the . next election. Its . popularity has declined since the legislative election over its failure . to translate its parliamentary domination into real political power and . its perception as a power hungry group more preoccupied with its own . interests than national ones. The . legal wrangling adds to the suspense around an election that is . supposed to seal a transition to democracy after Mubarak was toppled in . an Arab Spring uprising last year, but has laid bare deep divisions over . how Egypt should be governed. The ruling means that new elections for the entire parliament will have to be held, six months after the first vote . Ahmed Shafiq, former prime minister under Hosni Mubarak, is a presidential candidate for the elections . The . law denying political rights to Mubarak's officials had prompted a . state election committee to disqualify Shafik from the presidential . race, but he was let back in on appeal, pending the court ruling. The . drama is emblematic of the tortuous and messy transition overseen by a . council of generals since Mubarak was ousted 16 months ago. A first-round presidential vote last . month pushed more moderate candidates out of the race and the choice now . facing 50 million eligible voters reflects a society torn between . desire for change after six decades of military rule and anxiety over . the damage wrought on Egypt by the subsequent political chaos. Unrest . has simmered on the streets of Egypt's cities throughout the period of . military rule, with opponents of the army calling for the removal of . 'feloul', or Mubarak-era remnants, from politics. The demand is far from . unanimous. 'Shafik is a . respectable man. We want him as president because we are not ready for . Egypt to return to the Dark Ages,' said Shafik supporter Sawsan Ali . Abdo. 'There is no such . thing as 'feloul'. We are all Egyptians. No to the plot seeking to . divide Egypt,' read one banner in the capital. Across the street, Shafik campaign posters were spray-painted red to obscure his face. It was deemed unconstitutional because it breached the principle of equality .

A Southern Californian man thrown off a Caribbean gay cruise earlier this week has said that that he and his partner were taunted, humiliated and subjected to inhumane treatment when they were arrested for indecent exposure. Dennis Jay Mayer, 53, of Palm Springs said he has no doubt they were arrested in Dominica because they were gay. Police said it was because they were seen having sex in public on the balcony of their ship cabin. Mayer said they were not having sex, but were ‘partially clothed’. Gay cruise: John Hart, 41, left, and Dennis Jay Mayer, 43, both of Palm Springs, California, pleaded guilty to indecent exposure after they were caught having sex . ‘The total experience was horrendous,’ he said. ‘They told us that they did not like us, that they did not like gay people.’ Mayer, a retired deputy sheriff, told how he and his partner of 17 years, John Robert Hart, 41, were summoned to speak to the captain wished to speak to us. ‘We were caught off guard,’ he added. Three cruise ship officials and six Dominica police officers were waiting for them. After police interviewed both men separately, the assistant captain spoke, Mayer said. ‘At this time, we are going to eject you from the ship. We have zero tolerance toward your behavior,’ Mayer recalled him saying. Police drove them to their headquarters, where they sat on a bench for nearly two hours without legal representation despite repeated requests, Mayer said. After police took pictures and obtained fingerprints, a high-ranking officer began a nearly four-hour interrogation. ‘He said: “You're being arrested for being gay. We're arresting you for the crime of buggery”,’ Mayer said. ‘He said that other people said that we were engaging in homosexual sex. He repeated that several times. I told him I didn't know why they would say that. I wasn't doing that.’ Mayer, 43, second from left, and Hart, 41, third from left, are escorted by police officers back to court following their arrest during a stop on a gay cruise of the Caribbean . During the interrogation, the police official threatened to take them to a clinic and have them medically examined for proof of homosexual activity, Mayer said. ‘He said, you know, we're looking for specific things, fluids, bruising, things of that nature,’ Mayer said.After making the threat, the official left the room, then came back saying they had a right to refuse the test, Mayer said. The two men were charged with indecent exposure and put in a five-by-eight-foot cell to await an appearance before a magistrate. ‘The treatment was inhumane,’ Mayer said. ‘We were detained for approximately 26 hours, and 19 of those locked in a cement cell, which had no running water, no toilet, no lights. ‘It stunk of feces and urine. It was infested with cockroaches, ants and bugs.’ Mayer said police brought in government officials to look at them. ‘They paraded many people by to look in on us as if we were some type of animal, which was quite humiliating,’ he said. ‘People got great joy in the pleasure of taunting us.’ On Thursday morning, police drove them to the courthouse in the capital of Roseau, passing through an angry crowd, Mayer said. ‘They were chanting and banging on the police vehicle. They were screaming things,’ he said. ‘I've never seen anything like this in my life, other than in movies. Both my partner and I really feared for our safety.’ Arrest: Two men on board a gay cruise of the Caribbean were arrested yesterday in Dominica, after being spotted having sex on the Celebrity cruise ship, pictured, from the port of Roseau . Police drove around the block twice to avoid the crowd and journalists. Officers formed a barricade with their bodies and urged Mayer and his partner to run into the courthouse and not stop. ‘It was very frightening,’ Mayer said. Once in the courtroom, Chief Magistrate Evaline Baptiste ordered the men to pay a nearly $900 fine after they pleaded guilty to indecent exposure. He called the two men ‘rogues and vagabonds’. Police then drove them to the airport, Mayer said. He added he would never return to Dominica. ‘I would not spend my money in a country that does not support gay behavior,’ he said. ‘Shame on us for not doing our research.’ The two initially were arrested on suspicion of the local equivalent of sodomy in the eastern Caribbean island, which prohibits sex between two men. The couple's attorney, Bernadette Lambert, said they were remorseful. 'They were struck by the beautiful mountains, the clean and clear fresh air and were having a few cocktails, and so threw caution to the wind,' she told the court. Party boat: The cruise was organized by Atlantis Events, a Southern California company that specializes in gay travel. The ship departed for St. Barts without the men, who are being held in a cell at police headquarters in the capital of Roseau . The two were aboard the Celebrity Summit cruise ship that had departed Puerto Rico on Saturday with about 2,000 passengers. The ship departed for St Barts late Wednesday, leaving the men behind. The cruise was organized by Atlantis Events, a Southern California company that specializes in gay travel. President . Rich Campbell said Thursday that the outcome of the case would have . been the same had it involved a heterosexual couple instead of two gay . men. 'It had nothing to . do with their sexual orientation and everything to do with their public . conduct,' he said. 'I have been in contact with the guests and they are . in good spirits.' Dozens of islanders packed the courtroom in the capital of Roseau to attend the 30-minute hearing. Dominica . Tourism Minister Ian Douglas said that tourists should abide by local . laws regardless of their religious or sexual orientation, and that . cruise ship officials should make passengers aware of these laws. 'It . cannot be the responsibility of Dominica to screen guests and tourists . before they come into the country,' he said. 'It is expected that any . time people come to a country, they will respect the laws of the . country.' Statement: President Rich Campbell, pictured, who is aboard the cruise, said 'The guests' actions were unfortunate but minor in this case and have no bearing on our overall guest experience' Gay Caribbean . cruises have been popular for several years despite hostility to . homosexuality on certain islands, especially in Jamaica, Barbados and . the Cayman Islands. Campbell said in a phone interview earlier that the company has organized many trips to Dominica and would 'happily return'. 'Many countries and municipalities that gay men visit and live in have antiquated laws on their books,' he said. 'These statutes don't pose a concern to us in planning a tourist visit.' 'The guests' actions were unfortunate but minor in this case and have no bearing on our overall guest experience,' he said via email. The pastor of Dominica's Trinity Baptist Church, Randy Rodney, praised the police for their intervention. 'I . am very pleased that the police were called in and have arrested the . people in question. I have warned about gay tourism and its implications . for Dominica,' said Mr Rodney, who is a vocal critic of homosexuality . and lesbianism. Holiday ethos: On the company website, guest are encouraged to enjoy themselves and it states 'The only rule is there are no rules' According to Cruisemates.com, no gay cruise lines sail to Jamaica or Barbados for fear of homophobia and possible violence. It said other places like the U.S. Virgin Islands welcome gay cruises. In 2010, the Cayman Islands rejected the arrival of an Atlantis gay cruise amid protests from religious groups even though homosexuality is legal on the archipelago. Don Weiner, a spokesman for Atlantic Events, referred all questions to Campbell, including why the company organized a trip to Dominica and whether it knew about the island's anti-sodomy laws. Elizabeth Jakeway, a spokeswoman for Celebrity Cruises, referred all questions to Atlantis. The last time authorities in the Caribbean intervened on a gay cruise was in February 2011, when agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested a California man aboard the Allure of the Seas, which had docked in St. Thomas. The man, Steven Barry Krumholz of West Hollywood, pleaded guilty to selling ecstasy, methamphetamine and ketamine to fellow passengers.","Men were spotted having sex on Celebrity Summit from dock in Dominica, where sex between two men is illegal .

Frenzied attack: Steven Shaw has been jailed indefinitely for the attempted murders of three people he tried to stab to death at a house party in Gateshead last year . A crazed attacker who strapped butcher's knives to his hands and tried to kill three partygoers after lying in wait under a bed has been jailed indefinitely. Steven Shaw pounced while Robyn Little and Dale Walker were sleeping on the bed above him during a house party. Mr Walker was knifed in the neck and side when Shaw came at him with arms flailing like 'someone doing a front crawl in swimming'. Miss Little was stabbed in the shoulder as she tried to help her boyfriend. As Shaw left the room, he came across party host Victoria Harrison, who had come to investigate the commotion. She was stabbed in the chest and suffered a heart attack and a collapsed lung as a result. She narrowly won her fight for life after major surgery. All three victims were treated at hospital after the summer celebration at the house on the Beacon Lough Estate in Gateshead last July. Newcastle Crown Court heard Shaw, of Seaburn Gardens, Gateshead, had originally been invited to the party, but left after a row broke out. He then went home to collect the large knives and a tea towel, which he used to cover his face, before creeping back to the party house. 'Bizarre plan of revenge': Police outside the house on the Beacon Lough Estate in Gateshead, where Shaw hid under a bed before jumping out and attacking his victims as they slept . Shaw, 34, denied he was the attacker, but was found guilty of three charges of attempted murder by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court after a trial. Mr Justice Coulson today ordered that he be jailed indefinitely for the protection of the public. Shaw was told he must serve at least 14 years before he could be considered for parole, but the judge warned that he may never be released. Mr Justice Coulson told him: 'You resolved on a bizarre plan of revenge. 'You returned to your flat and took out what were described as large butcher’s knives and a tea towel from your kitchen drawer and you went back to the house. Arms 'flailing': Shaw strapped knives to his hands and used a tea towel to cover his face during the attack . 'At least one of your own knives was strapped to your hand with tape. 'You covered your face, the bottom part of it, with the tea towel you had taken from your knife drawer. 'You then lay in wait under the bed in the spare room and waited for the occupants to go to bed. 'Robyn Little and Dale Walker went to bed and Robyn could not sleep because she had a feeling there was something or someone under the bed.' The court heard when Mr Walker went to put the light on as a result of his girlfriend’s fears he was instantly attacked and suffered stab wounds to his neck and side. Miss Little, who was 19 at the time of the attack, was stabbed in the shoulder when she tried to stop the frenzied assault on her boyfriend. As Shaw left the room, he ran into Victoria Harrison, whose party it was, on the stairs. Shaw, nicknamed Cookie, stabbed her in the chest and the knife severed a major artery which needed life-saving surgery. She had a heart attack and suffered a collapsed lung as a result of her injuries. Shaw, who was jailed in the past for squirting a woman in the face with ammonia during a commercial burglary and has previous convictions for carrying weapons, was warned he may never be released from jail. Judge Coulson told him: 'The sentence does not carry with it a guarantee that you will ever be released.' Tony Hawks, defending, told the court Shaw continues to protest his innocence.","Steven Shaw jailed indefinitely for attempted murders .

The National Union of Teachers (NUT) yesterday passed a resolution at its annual conference in Torquay seeking fresh walkouts as early as this summer amid concerns over changes to public-sector pensions. It came just hours after  the NASUWT conference  in Birmingham agreed to escalate its industrial action campaign – raising the possibility of strikes in the autumn term. One day strike in March: Teachers and lecturers marched through Central London to protest against staff and pension cuts just over a week ago . School's out: Teachers protested in 2002 in Central London after Government plans for changes to the London allowances . NASUWT treasurer Brian Cookson said there had been an ‘unprecedented, vicious, prejudiced and totally unjustified attack on the public sector’. He added:  ‘As teachers we are supreme professionals and we must be treated as such.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘It is absurd to say our school reforms are a “vicious assault” on the teaching profession. We are putting power back into the hands of talented heads and teachers.’ The NASUWT is likely  to need a fresh ballot of members to carry out strike action. The NUT balloted its members last spring. Pupils and working parents face added . disruption later in the year from further industrial action aimed at . derailing plans to scrap national pay rates and step up . performance-related pay for teachers. It is unclear exactly when industrial action will begin - although it could be as early as next term. The NASUWT resolution says: 'Conference is committed to further extending the current national action instructions to restore teachers' professionalism by attacking policies and practices which deprofessionalise teachers, including punitive fallout from the inspection and accountability regimes.' NUT general secretary Christine Blower: 'Our dispute is with the Secretary of State' Speaking ahead of the debate, NASUWT . general secretary Chris Keates said: 'The NASUWT has been in continuous . action short of strike since December 2011 in an attempt to get the . Government to focus on the real concerns of the profession and realise . the effect their attacks are having, not just on teachers and their . ability to do their job, but also on children and young people.' She added: 'Teachers do not feel . there is any area of their working lives the Government has not trampled . over and it is impairing their ability to focus on raising standards . for pupils. 'If the Government commits to . engaging constructively with the NASUWT there should be no need to move . to further industrial action but we have reached a point where we feel . we have no choice but to take steps to defend teacher professionalism . from these attacks.' The NASUWT was the first teaching union to pass a resolution calling for further industrial action over government reforms. Then the National Union of Teachers (NUT), which met for its annual conference in Torquay yesterday, discussed a priority motion  on government changes to public . sector pensions. The motion, heard in private, could pave the way for fresh walkouts as early as this summer. It instructs the executive to 'seek . to build a coalition of unions committed to further strike action in the . summer term and beyond to defeat the Government's proposals'. And it calls for a discussion with . those unions about 'all possible forms of joint strike and non-strike . action, including national, regional and selective strike action, and . campaigning activities such as joint national and local demonstrations . and public meetings'. More strikes in 2008: Protesters march along Whitehall in a one-day strike over pay . Head  teachers are letting bright children get away with bad behaviour because they fear that excluding them will affect their schools’ position in league tables, it has emerged. Last year, teaching union NASUWT launched 12 ballots in schools over ‘poor management’ which had an ‘adverse effect’ on teaching and led to ‘general poor behaviour’ in classes. Reasons for the ballots included bright  pupils not being excluded because ‘the  school needs their results so can’t afford to let them be out’. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘What you will often get with brighter pupils is... they will make comments to teachers like, “my mother will complain and you will lose your job”. The brighter pupils will often engage in far more back chatting with the teacher.’ The NUT, along with a number of other . trade unions, has been embroiled in a row with the Government over . public sector pensions for more than a year. It took part in a walkout over . pensions on June 30 last year, as well as joining the TUC's national day . of action on November 30. NUT members in London also staged a one-day walkout last month. Earlier this year the NUT, along with . some other teaching unions including the University and College Union, . declined to accept the Government's latest pensions offer. Renewed action over the summer term . would coincide with the main exams period, when teenagers across the . country take qualifications such as GCSEs and A-levels. The NUT insisted that it was not the union's intention to disrupt exams season. 'Our dispute is with the Secretary of . State, and ultimately, with the rest of the Government in terms of . public sector pensions,' NUT general secretary Christine Blower said. 'We will obviously, when we discuss . with other unions, discuss what timing makes sense and which regions . make sense, but we would not be setting out, deliberately, to undermine . the exams season.' The Association of Teachers and Lecturers is the only one of the big three teaching unions to accept the Government’s proposals. NUT figures suggest that a teacher . with ten years of experience, working in inner London, will lose an . extra £49 a month from April, rising to £123 a month by April 2014. A teacher with the same experience . outside London will lose  £30 a month from this April, rising to £74 a . month from April 2014. This weekend’s conference debated further . strike calls over pay, workload and Coalition plans to increase spot . checks of teachers to improve their performance. A Department for Education spokesman said the teachers' pensions deal is 'as good as it gets'. 'It guarantees teachers one of the best pensions available but keeps a lid on rising costs for the taxpayer,' he said. 'We've been in serious talks for . months with unions to address their concerns and reach a final . settlement. Reforms to public sector pensions are essential - the status . quo is not an option.'","Teachers consider summer term strikes over pay cuts which 'will see them lose £30 a month'

A courageous shopkeeper has told how he fought off a gun-wielding robber from inside his store using only a small wooden stick. Kapil Vaghela was confronted by a masked raider who burst into his convenience shop in Leicester before firing at him and his petrified fiancee. But rather than cower as the gunman ran amok in his shop, the 29-year-old store owner refused to hand over his takings and instead fought the robber with a nearby stick. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bravery: Mr Vaghela, armed only with a small wooden stick, prods at the masked gunman to keep him from getting away with the contents of his shop's till . Terrifying: The robber can clearly be seen pointing a firearm in the direction of Mr Vaghela, who remains unmoved in the face of danger . Dramatic CCTV footage of the incident last Wednesday night showed Mr Vaghela defiantly facing the robber as he fired three shots at him and his partner Trisha Patel, 27. The stunned newsagent realised he had not been injured and managed to see the intruder off after guessing he had fired blanks. Heroics: Shopkeeper Mr Vaghela modestly played down his bravery, insisting he simply wanted to protect his store and his fiancee . Mr Vaghela has since played down his heroics, insisting he just wanted 'protect my fiancee and the business I've worked so hard for.' He said the gunman had barged into the store demanding the contents of the till, apparently believing he could 'take whatever he wanted'. Mr Vaghela said: 'I tried my best to stay calm, so I pressed the panic button and sat down and picked up the stick and started prodding him with it. 'He kept trying to get to the till and he shot the gun three times. The first time I thought he had missed me. 'But then he aimed it right at my leg and fired it. I reached down and realised I wasn't injured and thought 'he's firing blanks', so I kept fighting.' The masked gunman ended up leaving the store empty handed after Mr Vaghela's brave intervention. The shopkeeper added: 'I think he thought he could walk into my shop, show the gun and take whatever he wanted. I don't think he expected me to fight back. 'I don't think I was especially brave but I decided I wasn't going to let him steal from me. Wanted: Leicestershire Police have since appealed for information about the raider, who burst into Mr Vaghela's store wearing sunglasses and with a hood over his head . The gunman had fired a weapon at Mr Vaghela, but the shopkeeper escaped injury as it's thought the gun contained blanks . 'I'm definitely feeling good because I was able to protect my fiancee and the business I've worked so hard for.' Detectives have appealed for the public's help to trace the robber. Officers have taken the shell casings for analysis. The suspect was wearing a grey full-length smock coat with its hood pulled over his face, and large sunglasses. They believe the weapon was gas-powered and have stressed that these could be fatal if fired into someone from a short distance.","Kapil Vaghela saw off gunman who had fired shots at him and his fiancee .

Smuggling, risking smokers’ health and denying the Treasury much-needed cash, are just a few of the consequences if cigarette packets are stripped of branding, a Tory MP warned today. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has paved the way for the Government to force tobacco firms to provide all cigarettes in plain packets in a bid to cut smoking. The coalition’s public consultation on plain packaging will launch on Monday - it follows a new law introduced last week which means all large shops and supermarkets must cover up cigarettes and hide tobacco products from public view. Plain future: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley today paved the way for the Government to force tobacco firms to provide all cigarettes in plain packets in a bid to cut smoking . Mr Lansley said he was 'open-minded' about the consultation, but added: 'We don’t work in partnership with the tobacco companies because we are trying to arrive at a point where they have no business in this country.' Such a ban would be the latest attack on smoking after previous governments banned tobacco companies describing certain brands of cigarettes as 'lights', outlawed sponsorship deals and forced firms to publish on packets graphic, gruesome images of cancerous organs and stark warnings about the potential health effects of lighting up. But Conservative MP Mark Field said today: 'The enforced introduction of plain packaging would infringe fundamental legal rights routinely afforded to international business, erode British intellectual property and brand equity and would create a dangerous precedent for the future of commercial free speech. Opposition: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, left, today paved the way plain cigarette packets in a bid to cut smoking, but Conservative MP Mark Field, right, said it could 'result in other sorts of negative impacts' 'I suspect plain packaging will result in other sorts of negative impacts, including the increased health threat posed by counterfeit tobacco, the encouragement of smuggled products and damaging competition. 'Indeed, the Treasury is already losing around £3 billion a year from tobacco that has evaded UK duty; criminal gangs operating a contraband supply chain at the expense of legitimate businesses. 'All of this could result in a potential loss of investment and jobs that goes way beyond the tobacco manufacturing sector.' He said tobacco was 'already one of the most highly regulated products in the world', adding: 'The introduction of plain packaging would most certainly amount to a regulation too far and the so-called ‘denormalisation’ of tobacco is not a sufficiently valid policy decision to justify such action.' But opposition to the plain packaging plan continues to grow with the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents Britain's corner shops, vowing to fight the proposal. Shuttererd: Supermarkets are no longer allowed to have cigarettes on display . Chief executive James Lowman said: 'The confusion that this would create would create further regulatory burdens on thousands of businesses. 'If every tobacco product looks the same it will be much harder for retailers and their staff to locate products on the shelf. This will slow down service times, affect customer service and make stock management harder. We will provide further details of retail costs to the consultation.' Pro-smoking group the Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest), has launched a Hands Off Our Packs campaign. Director Simon Clark has described plain packaging as 'the persecution of a minority lifestyle choice'. He said: 'Plain packaging is yet another attack on retailers and adult consumers. 'People are sick of being nannied by government.' And the International Chamber of Commerce claimed the plan could breach World Trade Organisation rules. UK . policy director Andrew Wilson said: 'It remains unclear as to whether . plain packaging is compatible with a number of the UK’s international . trade commitments, including important WTO intellectual property . agreements. Unhappy: Opposition to the plain packaging plan continued to grow with the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents Britain's corner shops, vowing to fight the proposal . 'With protectionism on the rise, this is not the time for the UK to be testing the limits of international trade law. 'What might be viewed as a justifiable measure in narrow terms, could set a precedent which would be hugely damaging to global trade.' Chancellor George Osborne announced in last month’s Budget that the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes would rise by 37p to an average of £7.36 and Mr Lansley’s latest comments came a week after a ban on tobacco promotion in England was introduced. New laws mean all large shops and supermarkets must cover up cigarettes and hide tobacco products from public view. First taste: More than 300,000 children under 16 try smoking each year and 5 per cent of children aged 11 to 15 are regular smokers, according to its figures . The Department of Health said the move was in response to evidence that cigarette displays in shops can encourage young people to take up the habit. More than 300,000 children under 16 try smoking each year and 5 per cent of children aged 11 to 15 are regular smokers, according to its figures. Meanwhile 39 per cent of smokers say that they were smoking regularly before the age of 16. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of campaigning charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), welcomed the plan, saying: . 'Now that cigarette advertising, promotion and sponsorship and tobacco displays have all been banned this is the obvious next step if the Government truly wants to make smoking history. 'Cigarettes are not like sweets or toys and should not be sold in fancy colourful packaging which makes them appealing to children. The British Heart Foundation’s policy director Betty McBride said: 'Tobacco advertising is rightly banned in the UK, yet current glitzy packaging clearly still advertises tobacco on the cigarette box. 'It’s an absurd loophole the tobacco industry takes full advantage of to lure in new young smokers.' Last year, Australia approved laws to introduce plain packaging to reduce the attractions of smoking, but three global tobacco giants launched lawsuits saying the rules infringed trademark rights. Three of the world’s four largest tobacco groups, Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco are challenging the new law in the High Court.","The coalition’s public consultation on plain packaging will launch on Monday .

A brilliant nuclear scientist working at the Cern nuclear laboratory was today sentenced to five in prison for plotting attacks on behalf of Al-Qaeda . Adlene Hicheur, who is French and from an Algerian background and who studied in England, was arrested in 2009 after police intercepted emails he sent to the Islamic terrorist organisation. Judges sitting at Paris Correctional Court said the 35-year-old should serve five years, with one suspended. Sentenced: A court sketch of physicist Adlene Hicheur, who worked for the European Centre for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, speaking during his trial in Paris . Hicheur has been on remand for two-and-a-half years since his arrest in October 2009, when he was a researcher at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern), a complex studying the start of the universe - or the 'Big Bang'. Prosecutor Guillaume Portenseigne said Hicheur had used his privileged position to act as a 'technical advisor for terrorist attacks', keeping in regular contact with Al-Qaeda operatives by email. 'I see lots of confusion and inaccuracies,' said Hicheur, referring to evidence which was mainly written in Arabic. 'The police interpreter has done a good job to make me look indefensible,' he added. Hicheur's trial comes in the wake of 23-year-old Mohammed Merah murdering seven victims in the south west of France earlier this year. Technology: The Cern laboratories near Geneva is home to the large hadron collider experiment which aims to understand the birth of the Universe . Both men grew up on French council . estates, came from Algerian backgrounds, and have alleged links with . radical religious groups who wanted to start a global jihad. Referring . to Merah murdering French troops in two French towns, Hicheur's lawyer . Patrick Baudouin said: 'Clearly, the events of Toulouse and Montauban . don't appear to create the most favorable conditions for the trial of . Adlene Hicheur.' Mr Baudouin added: 'Hicheur must not become a scapegoat for a case he has nothing to do with.' After . completing a thesis on high energy in 2003, Hicheur was a postgraduate . at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, at Chilton, near Didcot, . Oxfordshire. Tension: Hicheur's trial comes in the wake of 23-year-old Mohammed Merah murdering seven victims in the south west of France earlier this year . Hicheur was . arrested by anti-terrorist police in October 2009 at his parents' flat . on an estate on the outskirts of Lyon, in eastern France - close to . CERN, which straddles the Franco-Swiss border. Detectives . and security agents found masses of Al-Qaeda literature at his own flat . nearby, including advice on how to carry out terrorist crimes. Hicheur . had also been corresponding by email with Mustapha Debchi, a known . member of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) based in Algeria. On March 1, 2009, Hicheur wrote an email to Debchi proposing 'possible targets in Europe, and particularly in France.' On March 10, Hicheur sent another saying: 'Concerning the subject of targets - they differ depending what you want to achieve following the hits. 'For example: if it's about punishing the state because of its military activities in Muslim countries like Afghanistan, then it should be a purely military objective. 'For example - the air base at Cran-Gevrier, near Annecy, in France. This base trains troops and sends them to Afghanistan.' Debchi wrote to Hicheur in June 2009, and asked: 'Do not beat around the bush: are you prepared to work in a unit becoming active in France?'

Stinky fish fertilizer and two dozen law-enforcement officers kept pot smokers away from a grassy quad at the University of Colorado on Friday, but a few hundred protesters defied the crackdown and rallied on another field, where some lit up at 4.20pm. It was a far cry from last year's April 20 pot celebration, when more than 10,000 people gathered on the university's Norlin Quadrangle for the annual ritual of enjoying a smoke and demonstrating for legalizing marijuana. That made the university the scene of one of the largest campus celebrations of cannabis in the nation - a reputation that prompted university administrators to take extraordinary steps to stamp out this year's rally. They banned unauthorized visitors from campus, and spread smelly fertilizer on the Norlin Quad and declared it off-limits. They even booked Haitian-born hip-hop star Wyclef Jean for a free concert timed to coincide with the traditional 4.20pm pot gathering.

Yet the code stuck for obvious reasons: Authorities and nosy parents didn't know what it meant. HOW MANY STATES HAVE LEGALIZED MEDICAL MARIJUANA? In 1996, a ballot measure made California the first state to legalize medical marijuana. Sixteen states now allow the use of medicinal marijuana. In major cities like New York and Philadelphia, having small amounts of marijuana on your person has been decriminalised. HOW MANY STATES ARE CONSIDERING LEGALIZING RECREATIONAL POT? Two states - Colorado and Washington - are considering legalizing pot for recreational purposes. WHERE DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STAND? Marijuana use, sale and possession are illegal under federal law.","Officials at University of Colorado-Boulder covered quadrangle with fertiliser to deter students from taking part in annual 4/20 celebrations .

"By . Laura Clark . PUBLISHED: . 17:10 EST, 6 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:12 EST, 6 May 2012 . Disciplinarian: Sir Michael Wilshaw . HEAD teachers have threatened to pass a vote of no confidence in England’s chief inspector of schools amid claims of ‘bullyboy tactics’. The country’s biggest heads’ union accused the traditionalist leader of Ofsted of creating a ‘climate of fear’ in schools with ‘negative rhetoric’. The National Association of Head Teachers urged Sir Michael Wilshaw to rethink proposals for beefing up the school inspection system and to drop his ‘confrontational’ approach. Delegates at the union’s annual conference agreed a motion that ‘does not rule out a vote of no confidence in the future’ – effectively a call for his resignation. They also vowed to collect 100,000 signatures for a petition on Downing Street’s website to force a Commons debate on changes to the inspection regime. The row plunges relations between Ofsted and the teaching profession to their lowest point since ex-chief Chris Woodhead declared 15,000 incompetent teachers should be sacked in 1995. Heads are angry at a series of reforms proposed by Sir Michael, a former headmaster who recently turned round a failing comprehensive by imposing a strict discipline policy, since he became chief inspector of schools in January. These include a three-strikes-and-you’re-out policy which would involve giving an automatic failing verdict to any school achieving a ‘satisfactory’ grading at three inspections in a row. In addition, all ‘satisfactory’ schools would be rebadged as ‘requiring improvement’. Sir Michael has suggested 5,000 head teachers should fall into this category. A further proposal to remove the current . 48 hours’ notice of an inspection has already been dropped, with . Education Secretary Michael Gove admitting it implied a lack of trust. Last post: Sir Michael Wilshaw was the successful executive principal of the Mossbourne Academy, Hackney, east London before joining Ofsted . Delegates at the NAHT’s Harrogate conference went on the offensive over Sir Michael’s regime. Mike Curtis, head of Carterton Primary in Oxfordshire, declared: ‘Can we really put our trust in Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector? I suggest not. ‘We must stand up to the bullyboy tactics of Michael Wilshaw. We need to send a strong message to say we’ve had enough. We deplore his negative rhetoric, which is demoralising our members and creating a climate of fear in schools. ‘The time has come for action. Schools are not factories. We deal in people.’ Delegates initially put forward a motion calling for an immediate vote of no confidence in the chief inspector. After debate, they decided it amounted to the same  kind of bullying they were criticising. Members voted 98.9 per cent in favour of a new motion calling for a petition and a Parliamentary debate, which allows for the possibility of a no-confidence vote in future. During his career as a head, Sir Michael earned a reputation as a strict disciplinarian. He is best-known for transforming the fortunes of Mossbourne Academy in Hackney, East London, with tough discipline. A spokesman for Sir Michael said: ‘Ofsted has been listening to the views of head teachers, teachers and parents about its proposed changes to school inspections and will announce the results of its consultation at the end of the month.’","National Association of Head Teachers' anger at England’s chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw .

A 66-year-old man confessed to the grisly murders of an elderly couple after keeping the secret to himself for more than 30 years. Jack Wendell Pursel confessed to shooting Richard Huntbach, 85, and his wife, Goldie, 77, in their home in 1981 after walking into the Waterloo, Iowa police station and requesting an audience with officers. Director of Safety Services Dan Trelka told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier that this confession was ‘once in a lifetime.’ Guilty conscience: Jack Pursel, 66, walked into the Waterloo police station and confessed to the gruesome killings of an elderly couple in 1981 . Murdered: Robert and Goldie Huntbach were shot dead in their Waterloo, Iowa home in 1981; Pursel was a named a person of interest but was never charged . ‘He just came in off the street and wanted to get this off his chest,’ he said. Police said that Pursel said he went to the Huntbach’s home with the intent to rob and kill them, according to Radio Iowa. The Huntbachs were both found bound and gagged, and dead from multiple gunshot wounds. The house had been pillaged, as well. No arrest was ever made in the case as police looked in vain for leads. He was named a person of interest in the case, but was never charged. Pursel began serving a 21-year sentence after he was convicted of sexual acts with a minor, but was paroled in 1992. The police believe Pursel has intimate knowledge of the crime and could have been dating a relative of the Huntbachs at the time of the murders. Mystery: The murders were eventually dubbed a cold case after police ran out of leads . Booming: Waterloo had a population of around 76,000 at the 1980 Census, but its population has since declined . ‘It is my understanding (Pursel) found Christ and felt this was the right thing to do,’ Mr Trelka told the Courier. Pursel, who appeared in court Thursday wearing a grey suit and glasses, was charged with first-degree murder and is now being held on $2million bond. 'It is my understanding (Pursel) found Christ and felt this was the right thing to do.' -Director of Waterloo Safety Services Dan Trelka . According to the Courier, Black Hawk County Attorney Thomas Ferguson requested such a high bond due to the brutal nature of the killings. The newspaper reports that the couple’s bodies were discovered by a neighbour, both with fatal gunshot wounds to the head. According to Iowacoldcases.org, Mr Huntbach was downstairs in the living room and his wife was found in the hallway on the second floor. He also had injuries on his wrists and chest. A cattle prod was found in the master bedroom, and may have been used on him before he was murdered.The Gazette reported that Mr Huntbach was retired from a packing company. Neighbours described them as ‘real nice, quiet people who kept to themselves.’ Pursel’s hearing has been set for May 18.","Jack Wendell Pursel, 66, walked into police station and confessed to 1981 murders of Richard and Goldie Huntbach .

The campaign trail to the White House is well-known as one of the world's most drawn-out political battles. Usually, by the time the final vote takes place, many voters become fed up with the election. And often the difficulty of staying enthusiastic is made worse by the whole process starting up again not long afterwards. The Republican Presidential candidate was asked the cheeky question after being visited on the campaign trail by his wife, son and three grandchildren (pictured) But it seems having the attention span of a four-year-old makes it even harder to maintain an interest. Mitt Romney - the Republican candidate for this year's election battle for the Presidency - has told how his grandson has already asked whether he has won the race. Four-year-old Nate was reported to have questioned his grandfather immediately after he visited him on the campaign trail in Madison, Wisconsin. Speaking to ABC News, Mr Romney said: 'The first thing he said when he saw me was: 'Have you beat Barack Obama yet?'' Despite months to go until the date of the 2012 Presidential vote, some of Mitt Romney's younger family members are seemingly tiring of the election battle . The Republican candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney said he was 'hoping to do that' when asked about beating Barack Obama . The Republican candidate, who was visited by another two of his 18 grandchildren on the back of his tour bus, as well as by his wife and son was reported to have replied in good spirits after the cheeky question: . 'Not yet, hoping to do that.' As well as being quizzed on his fortunes in the upcoming election, Mr Romney asked the children about their favourite part of the campaign trail. Answers varied from the comfortable couches on their grandfather's bus, to a giant jar of peanut M and M's. Mitt Romney is hoping to woo white conservatives who shunned him in the Republican primaries, but are now crucial to his quest to unseat President Obama in November . And Mitt Romney's grandchildren were also eager to show their support for the 65-year-old. The Republican candidate fielded a question from a reporter asking who Parker, his grandson, thinks will win. Mr Romney then asked the little boy himself who, apparently shy, pointed at his grandfather. Despite the optimism of Mr Romney's grandson, however, the Republican has elsewhere remained cautious when assessing his chances. On his campaign plane he talked down his hopes of winning Wisconsin -which hasn't voted for a Republican for president since 1984. Speaking to reporters, he said: 'It's just such a long way out. 'So much happens (and) I can't make any predictions other than we're going to work hard.'","With months still left to go, one of the President's younger family members is reportedly already tiring of the campaign trail .

A CIA officer at the centre of the Colombian prostitute scandal has been accused of playing away from home again - by a woman he met while he was protecting President Obama during an official visit to Ireland. Secret Service Agent Arthur Huntington is alleged to have lied about being divorced to bed a Canadian woman he met in Dublin, where he had been assigned as part of the President's security team during his trip to the Irish capital in May 2011. The woman, who only agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, said the CIA officer's wife 'deserves to know' about the liaison because his indiscretions were 'not a one-time thing'. Tryst: The couple are alleged to have met at the Marriott East Side, on Lexington Avenue in New York for one of their liaisons . Scene: The altercation between the prostitute and the agent occurred at Cartegena's Hotel Caribe when the President was in the country for a summit . It wasn't until months later, when news broke of the scandal involving him and a prostitute from Cartegena, she realised he had lied to her, she has claimed. The 42-year-old woman, a single mother-of-two, claims she felt 'sick' and 'used' when she discovered his dalliance with the hooker - and that he was married and living in Maryland with his wife and children. She claims she 'never would have gone near him' had she known the truth about the agent, the New York Daily News reported. She has described in detail the night Huntington allegedly came on to her in a Dublin pub, with the line: 'You're not getting away from me tonight.' Scandal: Dania Suarez claims she was swindled by the U.S. agent who agreed to pay her for sex . The brunette said while he did not try to bed her that night, 41-year-old Huntington then pursued her by email for months until the pair met in Manhattan for a two-day tryst in August last year. She claimed Huntington told her he was a divorced father-of-two and he bedded her in the Marriott East Side, on Lexington Avenue in New York. She told the New York Daily News: 'Why is it the President is the only one that should have morals? The people that are protecting him should be mindful of what they are doing. 'He’s under a microscope now because he’s put himself there. '(His) job is more than a job. It’s a responsibility. 'I feel used. He actively pursued me while he was married - and not only me. How many more others?' She said she continued to keep in touch with the CIA officer until his Colombia trip last month. Shortly afterwards she discovered the truth. Huntington sparked the prostitution scandal in Colombia in April, which brought shame on Obama's administration. The Secret Service Agent spent the night with Dania Suarez while on duty in South America but paid only $28 of his $800 tab, . His encounter with the escort led to police being called to the luxury Hotel Caribe, and subsequently a major Secret Service investigation where nine agents lost their jobs. The scandal overshadowed Barack Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas. The Canadian woman said the only good thing she could say about Huntington was that he paid for her dinners and drinks - in contrast to his actions in Cartegena, she told the New York Daily News.","Single mother claimed Arthur Huntington came on to her during President's official visit to Ireland .

Alexander Caven-Atack, was just 10-months-old when he developed a bacterial infection from the injury, which was no bigger than a 10p coin. He had to have 80 per cent of his top layer of skin removed with a scalpel and spent almost a fortnight in hospital. Recovered: Alexander Caven-Atack after his ordeal with his father Andrew, 60 . The scald was treated by doctors at Colchester General Hospital’s accident and emergency department but the infection was missed. Five days later his skin was blistering and peeling off on his back, arms and face. He was rushed to the burns unit at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, where surgeons removed the infected skin during six operations. His parents were told their baby may not survive the procedure. Alexander has now made a full recovery and his father Andrew, 60, and mother Sarah, 40, are warning that even minor burns can lead to the potentially fatal Scalded Skin Syndrome. Andrew, from Colchester, Essex, said: 'A consultant at Broomfield told me after how lucky Alexander had been to survive. 'If it had have been identified earlier it could have been treated with a course of antibiotics and creams. ' Sore: Alexander Caven-Atack in Broomfield Hospital's burns unit suffering from Scalded Skin Syndrome . At it was, doctors wrapped Alexander in an anti-septic suit to recover. 'He was bandaged and we were presented with this little mummy with just his thumbs and one big toe showing,' Mr Caven-Atack, a music publisher, said. 'He spent two weeks in intensive care and had antibiotics administered intravenously. 'He was fed by tube. Our normally smiley baby did not smile once in two weeks.' Alexander received the 10p piece-sized burn when he grabbed his father's cup of tea as they sat in the garden on September 3 last year. 'It tipped over him and over his bare legs,' Mr Caven-Atack said. 'I ran with him to the kitchen and took his clothes off straight away.' The burn triggered the extremely rare Scalded Skin Syndrome, an infection caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus Aureus, and the youngster needed 13 days of hospital treatment. Mr Caven-Atack said: 'We want to use his ordeal to enure the next child doesn't go through what he went through. He really could have died.' Ross Carroll, whose charity .

A gunman opened fire on a BMW near the University of Southern California campus early Wednesday, killing two graduate students from China in what may have been a carjacking attempt, police said. The couple was sitting in the new 3-series luxury car when the gunman fired around 1am, shattering the car windows. The woman, Ying Wu, was found slumped in the front passenger seat. The wounded man, Ming Qu, managed to get out of the car and run to a nearby home, where he pounded on the door pleading for help and someone called 911, according to police, but soon collapsed. It wasn't known if anyone answered the door before the man collapsed. Paramedics took the victims to downtown's California Hospital Medical Centre where they were dead on arrival, authorities said. 'This is every parent's nightmare,’police Cmdr. Andrew Smith told the Associated Press. The man, Ming Qu, and the woman, Ying Wu, were both graduate students from China studying electrical engineering, the university said in a statement. Both were in their 20s, police said. Their hometowns and exact ages were not immediately clear. Investigators say it may have been a robbery or a carjacking attempt. Witnesses said the car was in the roadway, not at the curb, at the time of the shooting. The gunman fled and no one has been arrested, Cmdr. Smith said. Police have taken the $60,000 BMW away for examination and were attempting to determine if there were any surveillance cameras in the area. Blown out: The windows of the BMW luxury car were blown away; Ying Wu was found slumped over in her seat, and Qu tried to get out for help . Attempted: Police believe they were murdered either in an attempted robbery or car-jacking . Four people have been killed this year in the area, police said, but violent crime is down 20 per cent this year. Gloria Tigolo lives on the street where the shooting occurred and said she heard a single gunshot. She went downstairs but didn't go outside because it was raining. 'It was just one big shot,' she said. 'I am amazed that one gunshot could kill two people.' Investigators said earlier that several shots were fired at the couple. Ms Tigolo said the area is peaceful . and this is the first shooting she can recall since she moved to the . neighbourhood three years ago.

Both women said they hadn't . heard from their parents because of the time difference, but they do . expect to hear from them. Ms Hwang, who is studying piano, said she's often at the campus late at night and she like other international students are scared because the school is located in a gritty part of Los Angeles. 'A lot of people are going to be talking about the shooting because they were international students,' said Hwang, who moved from Baltimore to be in a safer area. Students Kenny Liu, who is Chinese-American and lives nine blocks from where the shooting occurred, said the area is unsafe and that it's also not uncommon to see BMWs and other expensive cars parked near the campus. 'If I owned a BMW, I wouldn't drive it here,' he said. USC is in an urban centre not far from gang-infested neighbourhoods. But gentrification has begun in the West Adams district.

It’s not exactly a life of luxury for newly incarcerated George Zimmerman, but at least he’s not without his Jolly Ranchers and Nutri-Grain bars. Now accused of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin in February, Zimmerman checked into the John E. Polk Correctional Facility in Sanford, Florida, last night. As he was admitted to the jail last night, he purchased $79.84 worth of items at the prison's commissary. Scroll down for video . Troubled: The legal challenges Zimerman faces . seemed to weigh on him during his first public appearance since the . February 26 shooting of Trayvon Martin . Media circus: Mark O'Mara was surrounded by TV reporters and cameras as he entered the jail for Zimmerman's court appearance . A report from the Seminole County Corrections department listed the items, which included the essentials: Ivory and Irish Spring soap, deodorant, underwear and socks. Among the snacks purchased on his first night were Nutrigrain bars, white cheddar popcorn, Jolly Ranchers, chocolate crème cookies and root beer barrels. To pass the time behind bars, he also purchased playing cards and crossword and word search puzzle books. Other items included thermal clothes, contact lens solution and several packages of beef sticks. Essentials: A jail commissary report details the items that Zimmerman purchased before his first night in lock-up . Hygiene and sustenance: Among the items purchased by Zimmerman were Irish Spring soap and Nutri-Grain bars . Jailed: George Zimmerman is pictured Wednesday night in a booking photo taken at Seminole County Correctional Facility . A separate booking report detailed his tattoos - the tragedy and drama theatre masks on his left arm and a cross on his chest that says 'Christine'. The John E. Polk Correctional Facility, where Zimmerman is now held, has the capacity for up to 1,396 inmates. While Zimmerman's cell is equipped for two inmates, he will be alone, and remain separated from the general population. Body art: A booking report says he has a tattoo of the tragedy and drama theatre masks (like the ones pictured above) on his left arm . He will be allowed three hours of recreation time each week, and provided three meals a day: Breakfast at 4am, lunch at 10:30am and dinner at 4pm. Zimmerman will have access to books and magazines from the jail's library cart, and he’s also allowed to have a Bible. But just one night in jail has proven to be a strain on the 28-year-old, who claims he was acting in self-defence when he shot Trayvon, who was unarmed. Law enforcement sources told ABC News that Zimmerman 'wept quite a bit' during the night. Zimmerman’s attorney Mark O'Mara said . after the court appearance today: 'He is tired. He has gone through some . tribulations. He is facing second-degree murder charges now. He is . frightened. That would frighten any of us'. 'He . has a lot of hatred focused on him right now,' the defense attorney . said. 'I'm hoping that the hatred settles down now that we're moving . forward'. To prove . second-degree murder, prosecutors must show that Zimmerman committed an . 'imminently dangerous' act that showed a 'depraved' lack of regard for . human life. New home: Zimmerman will remain here, at the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, until a bail hearing in a few weeks . Standing by: Zimmerman stood with his new attorney, Mark O'Mara, as he listed to the judge . The special prosecutor in the case, Angela Corey, has refused to explain exactly how she arrived at the charge. But . in the affidavit, prosecutors said Zimmerman spotted Martin while . patrolling his gated community, got out of his vehicle and followed the . young man. Prosecutors interviewed a friend of Martin's who was talking to him over the phone moments before the shooting. Custody: George Zimmerman is handcuffed as he makes his first court appearance at the Seminole County jail Thursday afternoon . His parents' lawyer has said that Martin was talking to his girlfriend, identified only as Deedee, back in Miami. 'During this time, Martin was on the phone with a friend and described to her what was happening,' the affidavit said. 'The witness advised that Martin was . scared because he was being followed through the complex by an unknown . male and didn't know why'. 'No public pressure': State Attorney Angela Corey, appointed to prosecute the Trayvon Martin case, said she charged Zimmerman with murder based only on her judgement of the law in Florida . One request: O'Mara (centre) asked the judge to temporarily seal evidence in the case, including witness statements, so it doesn't come out piecemeal . During a recorded call to a police dispatcher, Zimmerman 'made reference to people he felt had committed and gotten away with break-ins in his neighborhood. Later while talking about Martin, Zimmerman stated 'these a------s, they always get away' and also said 'these f-----g punks,' according to the affidavit. If convicted of the second-degree murder charge, he faces a mandatory sentence of 25 years in prison and a maximum of life. Facing charges: A month and a half after George .

Bobbies off the beat: New South Yorkshire chief constable David Crompton, pictured, wants to take warranted officers off the streets . Plans to replace beat policemen with community support officers were heavily criticised yesterday...by the man who created the so-called plastic PCs in the first place. Fully-trained officers would be taken off the streets and put into fast response teams. Community support officers – also nicknamed ‘Blunkett’s Bobbies’ after former home secretary David Blunkett under whose watch they were established – lack the arrest powers available to warranted officers. They are also cheaper and have less training. But even Mr Blunkett, who is an MP in Sheffield, condemned the plans, saying PCSOs were intended to help police but not replace them. He said: ‘Warranted officers will always be required to conduct arrests, develop good scientific forensic investigations and build the kind of community policing which engages those living there.’ The proposals are for South Yorkshire Police but there are fears the idea could be adopted by other forces. The senior officer behind them was forced to deny it would lead to officers sitting in police stations. Chief Constable David Crompton said: ‘They will still be working in the same areas. ‘If somebody needs a police officer, they will get one, in the same way they always have.’ 'We’re determined to use both police officers and PCSOs as efficiently as we possibly can. What we want to do is make sure that we send them to the right jobs,' he said. Scroll down for video . Better off: The force say that removing officers, right, from the streets, and replacing them with PCSOs, left, will cut crime in their area . 'Some 80 per cent of the things we . deal with are not related to crime at all. Of the remaining 20 per cent, . only a small number turn out to be confrontational situations. PCSOs . are asked to deal with a huge range of things already – what we’re . looking at is if there’s anything else we can do to maximise what we get . out of them.' In an interview this morning David Crompton said the issue was a 'storm in a tea cup'. Opposed: Former Home Secretary David Blunkett helped bring in PCSOs but says they are not a replacement for beat bobbies . He told the BBC Radio 4 Today . programme the policy had been in place for some time but 'grabbed the . headlines' based on an update report to the local police authority. Mr Crompton said: 'Any suggestion we are taking officers away from areas they have been working in the past is plain wrong. 'We have had PCSOs in the police service for 10 years, we have some fantastic, dedicated and talented people. 'They are capable of dealing with 95% . of the community type issues which come up. But there are also generally . things, particularly around more confrontational situations, you would . genuinely want a police office for. 'When those occasions arise people will have a police officer to deal with that.' Former Home Secretary David Blunkett . has raised concerns about the proposals saying it is a mistake, despite . being the man who brought in PCSOs, then dubbed 'Blunkett's Bobbies'. A spokesman for the South Yorkshire . Police Federation, which represents rank and file police, said: ‘What we . don’t want is for officers to only turn up when someone needs arresting . or dealing with. ‘We don’t want to be seen to be the bad guys. 1960s: Z-Cars stars Colin Welland, James Lynch, Stratford Johns and Brian Blessed, and the move by South Yorkshire police has been described as a return to this style of policing . ‘We’ve spent years and years with communities building up a relationship with the police.’ Opposition leader Ed Miliband said he did not back the proposals. Speaking in Wath upon Dearne in South . Yorkshire, the Labour leader said: 'We need PCSOs but we need them . supporting and working with police officers on the frontline. I think . that's the kind of neighbourhood policing that people want to see. 'I don't think they want police . officers out of the way, just in their patrol cars, just dealing with . other issues and away from the beat.

A pair of amateur hot air balloonists died when their craft burst into flames as they attempted a high altitude four-mile ascent. Pilot Lee Pibworth, 42, and his passenger Allan Burnett, 55, were killed after their £20,000 balloon plunged towards earth at more than 60mph before crashing into a field at Midsomer Norton in Somerset. An inquest at Flax Bourton was today told that the balloon caught fire before two oxygen cylinders on board exploded after it hit the ground at Prattens Bowls Club on New Year’s Day 2011. Tragic: Lee Pibworth, left, and scout leader Allan Burnett were tragically killed on New Year's Day 2011 when their hot air balloon crashed into a field in North Somerset . Both men sustained horrific injuries in the accident with tree surgeon Mr Pibworth, a father-of-one, dying instantly from chest injuries. The inquest heard that father-of-three Mr Burnett survived the impact but suffered extensive fractures and was unable to escape the blaze alive. The pair from Bristol had decided to undertake the challenge in September 2010 in order for Mr Pibworth to gain the 19,700ft ascent standard necessary to earn a British Balloon and Airship Club gold medal. After spending months meticulously planning the flight they took off from a field in Chelworth just after 9am in front of proud family and friends. A crew with radios - including Mr Burnett’s son Alex - followed the men on the ground in a trailer but lost contact as they ascended into the clouds. Tragic: An aerial GV of the balloon crash site in at a Bowls club in Midsomer Norton, Somerset, where balloonists Allan Burnett and Lee Pibworth died . Alex Burnett, a trainee pilot at the time of the crash, told the inquest he received two calls from his dad during their flight. In the first, BT engineer Mr Burnett said they had reached 4,600 metres but were turning back after using 60 litres of gas. He called a final time to state that they had reached 6,600 metres - higher than required - and were heading to the ground. Alex told the inquest: 'I replied ‘roger that, see you at ground level’. We waited for them to land and tried to estimate their landing place. 'We drove past the accident site thinking it was a car crash after New Year’s Eve. He said a call was received from a friend saying there had been a balloon accident at Midsomer Norton and aware that no one else was flying in the area Alex drove back to the site. Shocking scene: Both men sustained horrific injuries in the accident with tree surgeon Mr Pibworth, a father-of-one, dying instantly from chest injuries . Giving evidence witnesses said the balloon resembled an 'upside down umbrella' as it sped to the ground. Tessa Hawtin, who lives just 150 yards from where the balloon landed said: 'There was a horrific noise, we were aware of it for two to three minutes before we actually saw the balloon. 'This balloon appeared out of the sky and instantly I knew it was wrong, it should not look like that. I just stood and watched. I felt so helpless. 'I was aware of somebody on the balloon, he was operating the burners. 'We watched the balloon for several minutes, it felt like a lifetime but it was probably two to three minutes. 'It went quiet and we realised the balloon had come to land.' Brave: Mr Pibworth wanted to gain the 19,700ft ascent standard necessary to earn a British Balloon and Airship Club gold medal . She told the inquest she first heard a 'ripping' noise at around 9.30am on the morning of the accident. Alex said his dad, an experienced mountaineer, was simply a passenger on theflight while experienced Mr Pibworth was pilot. He said both men were well prepared for their challenged and had planned for the -30 degrees Celsius temperatures and low oxygen at such a high altitude. Wing Commander Graham Maidrent, a pathologist, told the inquest both men could not have survived the incident. Mr Burnett suffered fractures to his legs, ribs and bleeding to his brain - but was alive when the blaze began. The pathologist said: 'The presence of soot in the trachea indicates that he was breathing during exposure to the fire.' He said Mr Burnett died from 'the effects of fire' and 'multiple injuries'. Mr Pibworth suffered fractures to his right arm, thigh, lumber spine, pelvis, sternum, a ruptured heart and lacerations to his liver. His death was caused by 'chest injuries'. Both men were identified by dental records. The inquest continues.","Balloon plummets to ground at more than 60mph .

The huge hound launched at Amy as she walked to her front door, knocking her to the ground and clamping its powerful jaws around her head. Savaged: Simon Hryhoruk and daughter Amy as he recovered in hospital after being mauled by the Akita dog which had attacked her without warning . Simon rugby tackled the dog and managed to prise apart its teeth. The dog then turned on Simon and savaged his back, hands, arms and legs - leaving him needing two operations and dozens of stitches.

The highest-priority risks to Britain's national security are influenza pandemics, coastal flooding, terrorist attacks and - a new addition - volcanic eruptions in Iceland, according to the recently published 2012 edition of the government's National Risk Register for Civil Emergencies. The list also said that ‘severe space weather’ poses a threat to communications systems, electronic circuits and power grids. Solar storms - eruptions of magnetic energy and charged particles - are part of the sun's normal 11-year cycle, which is expected to reach a peak next year. Heat is on: Solar storms on the Sun go through 11-year cycles - and will peak next year . The storms can't hurt people, but can . disturb electric grids, GPS systems and satellites. In 1989, a strong . solar storm knocked out the power grid in Quebec, cutting electricity to . 6 million people. Last week, the strongest solar storm since 2004 . passed without major disruptions. Last month, Parliament's defense committee called on the government to prepare for disruptions to electrical supplies and satellites from electromagnetic pulses - whether caused by the sun or by a nuclear weapon exploded in space. Space war is not included on the British government's risk register. ‘We are becoming more and more reliant on technology, and that technology is becoming more and more delicate,’ the committee's chairman, Conservative MP James Arbuthnot, told The Observer yesterday. ‘Be afraid, very afraid.’ Disruption: Radiation from the Sun flies out towards Earth at 93,000,000mph and can knock out power grids . Mark Gibbs, one of the Met Office's representatives on the panel, meanwhile, told paper: 'Potentially the biggest risk of all is to the electricity supply. Now in the U.S that is deemed to be a catastrophic risk. They could lose a very large proportion of their power grid. 'In the UK, for many different reasons – better engineering design, different way it operates, geology – the risk is less severe, but it is a risk nonetheless. Society can't function without power.’ Launched in 2008, the risk register assesses threats that are likely to endanger human welfare, the environment or security in Britain. It is the public version of the National Risk Assessment, which is classified. Volcanic eruptions have been added to the list since the last edition in 2010. Ash from the April 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano grounded European air travel for several days. But the British government says a more serious risk is posed by an effusive, or gas-rich, eruption. The 1783-84 Laki eruption in Iceland sent out noxious gases that spread as smog across Europe, causing crop failures, famine and thousands of deaths. The government said such an eruption ‘is now one of the highest-priority risks’ Britain faces.

This week the solid state video recorder that will store the images, a sort of cosmic Sky HD box, was delivered to the team building it at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Built by Colorado-based Seakr Engineering, it’s been hailed as the most reliable ever made. Heavens above: This image shows an artist's concept of the James Webb Space Telescope . Bright idea: A full-scale Webb sunshield membrane is deployed on the membrane test fixture at Mantech, Hunstville, ready for a precise measurement of its three dimensional shape . Star performer: This illustration shows how far back in time the Webb Telescope will look compared to the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope . James Webb will be very far from Earth . And it has to be, because it will operate in the most hostile conditions imaginable. The telescope is being sent to a point in the solar system called the ‘Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point’, a million miles away. It won't be possible to make repairs to it out there, so there will be a lot of fingers crossed back at mission control. By contrast Hubble sits in orbit a mere 350 miles above the Earth. Out at the Lagrange point, temperatures can plummet to as low as -411F (-210C). Space men: Engineers work on Webb's microshutters . On reflection: The mirrors are prepared for cryogenic testing, where they will be subjected to temperatures dipping to -415F, permitting engineers to measure in extreme detail how the shape of each mirror changes as it cools . However, Seakr are bullish about their bit of kit and claim that it’s so reliable there’s no need to include a back-up. Unlike the Hubble, Webb, which is almost as big as a 737, will use infrared instruments to scan the skies. What's more, Webb will have a 6.5 . meter diameter primary mirror, which would give it a significantly larger . collecting area than the mirrors available on the current generation of . space telescopes. Hubble's mirror is a much smaller 2.4 metres in diameter. This will mean that where Hubble can see the equivalent of ‘toddler galaxies’, Webb Telescope will be able see ‘baby galaxies’.

Former senator John Edwards set his sights on securing a place on the Supreme Court even as his once-promising political career was collapsing around him amid a seedy sex scandal. On the same day the prosecution rested in the case against Edwards - who is accused of being the mastermind behind a . plan to use secret payments to hide . his pregnant mistress - his former policy adviser said it was his ultimate goal to have a place on the highest court in the land. Over the last three weeks, prosecutors called to the witness stand some of his closest friends and advisers, many of whom gave dramatic, unflattering testimony about the former presidential candidate. The trial centers on whether Edwards knew what the money was being used for, and when he knew it. Today: The prosecution rested against former presidential candidate and Senator John Edwards in Greensboro, North Carolina, after three weeks of calling close friends and advisers to the stand . Defense lawyers for John Edwards Allison Van Laningham, Abbe Lowell and Alan Duncan: Defense will now take over after the prosecution rested today . While the past 14 days of testimony has focused on the money trail, the trial has also revisited Edwards' breathtaking fall. He had an affair with Rielle Hunter, a videographer on his campaign, as he renewed his marriage vows to his cancer-stricken wife. He fathered a child with Hunter and then a decision was made for his right-hand man to claim paternity so Edwards could keep up his lofty political ambitions. And he lied repeatedly to his wife, his advisers and the public. Delusional: It was also revealed today that Edwards had dreams of having a place on the Supreme Court . Jurors will have to look beyond Edwards' character, though. As prosecutors wrapped up their case, they showed the jury records detailing the money spent to hide Hunter — $319,500 in cash, luxury hotels, private jets and a $20,000-a-month rental mansion in Santa Barbara, California. The bills, flashed up on a large screen for the jury to see, were all paid by Fred Baron, a wealthy Texas lawyer who served as Edwards' 2008 campaign finance chairman. Baron began paying the expenses after tabloid reporters tracked down the pregnant mistress in Chapel Hill, where she had been secretly living in a house rented for her only a few miles from the Edwards family estate. Hunter was being closely watched over by Edwards' once-close confidant, Andrew Young, who falsely claimed paternity of boss' baby as the tabloid prepared to expose the affair. As part of the cover-up, Baron paid for Hunter — and Young and his wife — to cross the country on private flights worth more than $80,000 and stay in waterfront hotel suites costing nearly $44,000, including bar tabs and frequent room service. Baron also leased a mansion in Santa Barbara for the mistress as she prepared to give birth, with total costs over the next eight months totaling $184,378. Several witnesses testified that Edwards knew what the money was spent on; others were less definitive. The government must prove Edwards had criminal intent, and his defense team will ask U.S. District Court Judge Catherine C. Eagles on Friday to dismiss the case, arguing they haven't proven their case. If the judge allows the trial to go forward, the defense will begin presenting its side Monday — and may call Hunter to testify. Edwards could also take the stand in his own defense. Edwards has pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign finance violations. Prosecutors say he spearheaded a scheme to use nearly $1 million in secret payments from Baron and 101-year-old heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon to hide his affair and keep his presidential campaign viable. Family support: Edwards arrives at court with his elderly mother Bobbie Edwards. The trial is expected to last another three weeks . Witness: Jennifer Palmieri, John Edwards' chief spokesman during his 2004 presidential run, broke down yesterday while telling the court about her friendship with Elizabeth Edwards . Edwards denies knowing about the secret payments, which his lawyers contend were gifts from friends rather than campaign contributions. He faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted. Mistress: Rielle Hunter was not called by the prosecution as a witness . At one point, defense attorneys got Young to acknowledge that much of the $1 million was used to build the Youngs' dream house in North Carolina. Young and his wife also said they spent some of the money to hide Hunter. Young testified about meeting Edwards on a secluded, rural road months after his campaign ended. Edwards shocked Young by denying any knowledge of $725,000 in secret checks from the elderly heiress, Young testified. 'I didn't know about these, did you?' Edwards asked, according to Young. Worried he was being taped, Young lied and said no. Much of the money was spent after Edwards suspended his campaign at the end of January 2008 following a string of losses in the early primary states. Prosecutors contend it was still campaign money because Edwards had aspirations of becoming vice president or attorney general. Former Edwards economic policy adviser Leo Hindery testified earlier today he was an intermediary between Edwards and former Senator Tom Daschle, who was then with Barack Obama's campaign. On the night Obama won the Iowa caucuses, Edwards asked Hindery to talk to Obama's camp. 'He asked me to reach out to the Obama campaign and make clear his availability on the ticket,' Hindery said. Daschle responded: 'You really want me to do this now?' Hindery quoted him as saying. The . jockeying didn't end there. When Obama didn't accept Edwards with open . arms, he started talking to Hillary Clinton's campaign, Hindery said. Witness: Wendy Button, who once wrote speeches . for John Edwards, entered the federal courthouse yesterday after detailing . conversations she had with Edwards in July 2009 about his love child . It was Hindrey who revealed that Edwards dreamed of a Supreme Court appointment, telling jurors that the North Carolina Democrat was ready to surrender after then-candidate Barack Obama won the hotly contested Iowa caucuses. 'He asked me to reach out to the Obama campaign and make clear his availability on the ticket,' said Hindery, managing partner at Intermediary Partners, a private equity firm in New York. 'We talked about a more elaborate goal of Mr Edwards, which was to be a Supreme Court justice,' Hindrey told the federal panel. There were other highlights from the trial. Young said Hunter told Edwards she was pregnant in June 2007, weeks later than the aide originally claimed in a tell-all book published in 2010. Young said Edwards, told him to 'take care of it', meaning the pregnancy. 'He said she was a crazy slut and there was a one-in-three chance that it (the child) was his,' Young testified. Defense attorneys tried to paint the Youngs as a money-hungry couple who used the story for their own benefit. At one point, Edwards' adviser Tim Toben was asked in front of jurors about a sex tape that showed Edwards and Hunter. Toben admitted he had jokingly talked to Young about how much the sex tape might be worth. The defense lawyers produced a 2009 email from Toben to Young that said: 'Wonder what that tape is worth today?' The tape, and copies of it, was ordered destroyed by in a court settlement between the Youngs and Hunter.","Mistress Rielle Hunter was not called by the prosecution as a witness .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:07 EST, 12 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:08 EST, 12 March 2012 . Around 13 per cent of women and five per cent of men have some degree of urinary incontinence. Women are particularly affected after childbirth . Women who face the daily embarrassment of not quite reaching the ladies in time could find relief... with Botox. Injecting the the toxin directly into the wall of the organ was found to improve symptoms among women considered to have a “weak” bladder. On average, the number of times they suffered an episode of incontinence fell from six times a day to under once a day. The number of times they felt an urgent need to go to the toilet also fell, from around eight times a day to three times a day. About four out of 10 women treated with the powerful neurotoxin became continent again after six weeks and a third were still continent six months after treatment. The effects started to wear off after about six months. The study, published in the journal European Urology, was carried out at eight urogynaecology centres in the UK from 2006 to 2009. A total of 240 women were split into two groups, with 122 women given Botox and 118 receiving a dummy treatment. Researchers found improvements across a range of symptoms, including wetting oneself, feeling a need to rush to the toilet, and how often the women 'leaked' urine. However, there were side-effects - including some women needing to use a catheter to go to the toilet because of paralysis in the bladder muscle. It is unclear how many people in the UK suffer urinary incontinence, but it is thought to affect more than 50 million people in the developed world. Figures from a previous UK study found that 13 per cent of women and five per cent of men had some degree of urinary incontinence. Women are more at risk, owing in part to the effects of childbirth. Current treatments include pelvic floor exercises, behavioural therapy and drugs that can have side-effects, such as a dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision. Dr Douglas Tincello, senior lecturer from the University of Leicester and honorary consultant gynaecologist at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, led the latest study. He said some patients affected by the condition 'find it hard to cope', adding: 'One patient told me of a harrowing situation whereby she ended up passing water over a supermarket floor.' He continued: 'We found that a single treatment with botulinum toxin was a very effective treatment for the symptoms; patients were able to pass water one or two times less often during the day, and also noticed far fewer times when they had bad feelings of urgency and had to rush to the bathroom. 'In patients treated with botulinum toxin, incontinence episodes dropped from six a day to less than once a day. 'The number of urgency episodes fell from eight a day to three a day at six weeks. These changes were maintained at a similar level for up to six months. 'The treatment is not without complications; about one in eight women had some difficulty emptying their bladder at some time in the six months after treatment (due to paralysis of the bladder muscle). 'This was treated by teaching the women to use disposable catheters, but the effect does wear off after about six months on average.' Botox is not approved for the treatment of an overactive bladder in the UK and currently only used in trials . Dr Tincello said he was 'excited' by the results of the trial, saying Botox 'works so much better than the drugs we have.' He continued: 'My patients have been delighted with how well it works, even with the chance of needing to use a catheter. 'I’m delighted to say that botulinum toxin has much better results than a six-month course of tablets or bladder training. 'Our work may lead to Botox being licensed to treat overactive bladder syndrome in the UK.' The study was funded by the Moulton Charitable Trust, Wellbeing of Women and the Rosetrees Trust, and is the largest of its kind into Botox not to be funded by drug firms. Liz Campbell, director of Wellbeing of Women, said: 'This is a horrible condition and often means otherwise healthy active women curtail their lives, becoming prisoners in their homes. 'It is rarely discussed but affects many women.' Botox is currently not approved for the treatment of an overactive bladder in the UK, according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It is licensed in some European countries and Ireland for patients whose incontinence results from conditions such as spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis (MS).","Nearly half of women treated with Botox became continent again after six weeks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:46 EST, 13 July 2011 . Migrants who want to settle in the UK with a husband or wife will have to wait five years before they can claim benefits, ministers will announce today. The change - designed to deter sham marriages - more than doubles the  two years which a new spouse currently has to wait before claiming benefits. New spouses will also face tougher language tests to stay in Britain. Handcuffed: A suspect is arrested after a raid on sham marriages. Ministers hope tough new rules will reduce abuse of the system by immigrants (file picture) The measures will be launched by . Immigration Minister Damian Green in an overhaul of rules governing the . family route into Britain – which accounted for nearly 50,000 arrivals . last year. The policy paper will also examine ways to scale back the use . of ‘family life’ rights by criminals. Mr Green said: ‘For too long the family and marriage route into the UK has been abused as a way to get round our immigration law.’ The first language tests for spouses were introduced earlier this year, and require ‘conversational’ English, but the Home Office wants to make the test more demanding. It is hoped the changes will encourage migrants to integrate into British society. The benefits changes are designed to stop abuse of the system. Last year 48,900 family visas were granted to foreign nationals. Of those around 40,000 were for marriages or civil partners, and the remainder for dependants such as children and other relatives. In addition, another 21,000 spouses were given the right to stay indefinitely. In a recent case a sham marriage gang were revealed to be charging £10,695 for every bogus wedding they conducted. Crackdown: Immigration minister Damian Green unveiled the plans . Another case saw a gang jailed for a total of 14 years after marrying multiple partners to allow them to stay in Britain. In one case, a Pakistani national applied for a spouse visa on the basis of his marriage to someone settled in the UK. After being granted indefinite leave to remain, he divorced and returned to Pakistan where he remarried and then applied for entry clearance for his new partner. A Bolivian man who also claimed the right to a family life was able to stay in the UK partly because he owned a pet cat. The proposals will also look to prevent foreign criminals from staying in the UK. Every year hundreds of migrants who have committed crimes in this country use Article 8 of the Human Rights Act to thwart attempts to kick them out. Criticism mounted over Article 8 after Iraqi immigrant Aso Mohammed Ibrahim used it to stay in the UK despite running over and killing a 12-year-old girl, Amy Houston. Ibrahim, who was disqualified from driving at the time and had a number of previous convictions, fled the scene, leaving the youngster to ‘die like a dog’ under the wheel of his car. He was allowed to stay because the judge said he had started a relationship with a woman in Britain and had two children. A Sri Lankan robber was also allowed to remain in the UK because he had a girlfriend in Britain and judges ruled an Iraqi killer should not be sent back because he would have posed a risk to people in his home country. In 2010, 233 appeals against deportation were made. Of these, 149 were successful on human rights grounds - 102 of them citing Article Eight alone. Just 35 were under Article Three, which protects people from being killed or tortured if returned to an unsafe country. The rest used a mix of articles, figures from HM Courts Service showed. Last week Home Secretary Theresa May said she wanted a ‘better definition’ of Article 8 so more foreign criminals can be sent home. Mr Green added: ‘These cases clearly show why we need to take strong action and the proposals we will outline today will benefit the UK as a whole as well as individuals who would otherwise be exploited.’","Criminals using Human Rights to stay in UK also targeted .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . UPDATED: . 07:39 EST, 6 March 2012 . Imaginary: Sarah Jane Smith, 41, also claimed her real children were disabled in the benefits scam . A mother has escaped jail despite pretending she had eight children in a £42,000 benefits scam. Sarah Jane Smith, 41, even pretended that she and her two real children were disabled so that she could claim even more cash. Yes despite the false claims, stretching back to 2005, Smith, from Manchester, was spared jail after the judge heard she was fighting breast cancer for the second time. Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court was told that it was the second time Smith had carried out the scam. She had previously cheated taxpayers out of £27,854 in a four-year scam which began in 2005. The matter was dealt with in the civil courts, and she was ordered to repay the money. But Smith returned to the fraud soon afterwards, and began to invent more children after falling into debt. She submitted 25 bogus claims between October 2009 and August 2010. As well as claiming for made-up children, Smith also told benefit officials that she, her teenage son and adult daughter all had disabilities. Simon Blakebrough, prosecuting, said the initial claims for child tax credit had been legitimate - but suspicions were raised as new children were added. He said: 'A number of similar calls, similar claims, were made by the defendant over that period. 'She made a call claiming for fictitious children. 'She did the same again about a week later, claiming for other children that did not exist. As a result of an investigation, Ms Smith was arrested. 'She was interviewed and gave a no comment reply to all the questions put to her.' Smith, from Almond Close, Pendleton, . pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to one count of being knowingly . concerned in fraudulent activity with a view to obtain payment of tax . credit. She broke down in tears in the dock. House of fictional children: Smith's home in Pendleton, Manchester . The court heard that Inland Revenue officers began their criminal investigation in 2009, after becoming suspicious as the amounts she claimed - and her number of children - increased year after year. Judge Adrian Smith handed her a six-month jail sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered her to complete 120 hours of unpaid work. Describing her earlier scam, the judge said: 'You were not prosecuted. You were dealt with through civil jurisdiction. 'You do not come before the court as a person of good character but there is another side to you which impresses people.' The mother, who is currently paying back the £27,000 she claimed in her initial scam, now faces repaying the second amount as well. Austin .

The head of the Catholic church in Scotland has added his voice to growing calls for Christians to be allowed to express their beliefs at work. In his Easter Sunday homily, Cardinal Keith O'Brien will urge Christians to  'wear proudly a symbol of the cross of Christ on their garments each and every day of their lives'. Speaking at Edinburgh's St Mary's Cathedral tomorrow, he will quote . Pope Benedict XVI, who said Christians 'need to be free to act in . accordance with their own principles'. Easter message: Cardinal Keith O'Brien (above), the head of the Scottish Catholic church, will call on Christians to 'wear proudly' a crucifix every day . He will add: 'I know that many of you do wear . such a cross of Christ, not in any ostentatious way, not in a way that . might harm you at your work or recreation, but a simple indication that . you value the role of Jesus Christ in the history of the world, that you . are trying to live by Christ's standards in your own daily life.' His message will give further weight to a campaign led by former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey which calls on Prime Minister David Cameron to back the legal rights of Christians at work. He will say: 'I hope that increasing numbers of Christians adopt the practice of wearing a cross in a simple and discreet way as a symbol of their beliefs. 'Easter provides the ideal time to remind ourselves of the centrality of the cross in our Christian faith. Campaign: The former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey is leading a protest to back the rights of Christians to express their beliefs at work . 'A simple lapel cross pin costs around £1. Since this is less than a chocolate Easter egg, I hope many people will consider giving some as gifts and wearing them with pride.' Lord Carey wants the Prime Minister to press for greater legal protection for Christians who have been sacked for following their consciences when a group of test cases are heard by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg next month. Four Christians are taking legal action at a landmark hearing because they believe British laws have failed to protect their human rights to wear religious symbols or opt out of gay rights legislation. The cases include those of Shirley Chaplin, a Devon nurse banned from working on the wards after she failed to hide a cross she had worn since she was 16, and Gary MacFarlane, who was sacked as a Relate counsellor after suggesting he would refuse to provide sexual therapy to gay couples.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . UPDATED: . 08:06 EST, 6 March 2012 . Mystery: Lord Lucan with his son, George Bingham, now the 8th Lord Lucan, who claims he has not seen his father since his disappearance in November 1974 . The son of fugitive Lord Lucan today confirmed that he WAS sent on a trip to Africa, where it is claimed the missing Earl would watch him from a distance. Speaking for the first time in years, George Bingham, the 8th Lord Lucan, said he remembers going to Kenya around 1985, but 'to his knowledge' he didn’t meet him in person. It backs up claims of an aide to one of Lucan’s best friends, who said she was told to arrange the trip of George and his two sisters around 1980, six years after the Earl went on the run following the murder of the children's nanny. The woman, who worked for John Aspinall and asked to be given an assumed name of Jill Findlay in an interview last month, said 'their father would observe them from a distance just to see how they were growing up.'In recent weeks, speculation has mounted over Lucan's whereabouts after three men - an former East End gangster . and two engineers - claimed to have seen the missing Earl in bars in . Africa following his disappearance. Lord Lucan's brother, Hugh, has also spoken out to say he believes he might not be dead. Speaking . to The Times about the Kenya trip, George Bingham said: 'Both my sisters were present as were two other . families, neither of which had any connections to John Aspinall. 'The airline tickets, safari expenses and hotels, as regards myself, were paid for by my family trust.' But he denies ever consciously meeting his father. 'I have not, to the best of my knowledge, seen my father since November 1974 [when he disappeared].' He said claims to the contrary, which have been made in one newspaper, were defamatory. 'My father was declared legally dead by a High Court judge well over a decade ago. 'To suggest that I have met and spoken with my father... is to make a possible accessory, after the fact, to a grisly murder. 'It is to call me a criminal and it is thus a most serious libel.' No contact: George (pictured with his father and mother, Lady Lucan) denies claims he has spoken to the Earl since his disappearance following the murder the family nanny . Breaks silence: George Bingham (pictured at Royal Ascot in 2004) says he took time out of banking to research his father's disappearance and now spends a lot of time in North Africa . To add further speculation to the melting pot, Lord Lucan's widow, right, claims the missing Earl committed suicide the day after the nanny's murder on November 7, 1974. The Countess of Lucan, 74, says she is convinced her husband boarded a ferry and 'jumped off mid-Channel in the way of the propellers'. This, she said, was why his body was never found. Lucan escaped the family home in Lower Belgrave Street in London after Lady Lucan ran crying to the nearby Plumber's Arms pub screaming: ‘Help me, help me, help me! He’s in the house! He’s murdered my nanny!’ She claimed he had killed Sandra Rivett, whose body was found tied up in a mailbag in the basement, and then attacked her. Days later, Lucan's car was found at Newhaven in East Sussex. Speaking to The Times, Lady Lucan said: 'The trail goes cold after his Ford Corsair was found in Newhaven. 'There isn't much at Newhaven except for the sea and boats and so I believe that he boarded the ferry and jumped off mid-Channel in the way of the propellers, which is why his body was never found.' Lucan vanished following the murder of his children's nanny on November 7, 1974. After the attack, he went to the home of friends, telling them he had found the nanny had been murdered. Three days later, his car was found abandoned in Newhaven, East Sussex, with bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping matching the one found in the Belgravia basement. There was speculation he had committed suicide, but no body was found. Last month, old East-End gangster Dennis Stafford insists he met the elusive aristocrat in Africa whilst on the run from authorities. The former friend of the Kray twins . says he came across Lord Lucan in the Monapatapa Hotel, in Harare, . Zimbabwe, he believes, sometime between 1982 and 1983. Engineers Lawrie Prebble and Ian . Meyrick also came forward to say they are 'completely convinced' the man . they saw drinking in a hotel bar in Botswana with six friends is the . legendary Lucan. George Bingham has previously said . his 'best guess' was that his father had contracted a burglar to raid . the house in an insurance fraud. His father then discovered the macabre . scene. But now he appears less specific, according to The Times. The . 44-year-old, who was in the house along with his sisters Frances and . Camilla at the time of the attack, told the paper: 'I still believe that . in this country, you are innocent until proven guilty by proper trial, . not by inquest juries.' George . Bingham followed his father into the world of banking before taking . time off to research the mystery surrounding his father. He said he now spends 'a lot of time' in North Africa, where he keeps a yacht. Claims: Stafford claims he recognised Lord Lucan from the London club scene where both were regular faces .

Following the latest flurry of findings and sightings, Ladbrokes has slashed the odds of Lord Lucan's being found alive this year. The bookies now say the odds of Lord Lucan officially being found alive in Africa is now 8/1, down from 16/1. Ladbrokes . also offer a 20/1 chance he is brought back to the UK for sentencing . this year and 12/1 that the mystery surrounding his disappearance is . resolved once and for all, should he be confirmed as deceased. Spokesman . Jessica Bridge said: 'The hunt for Lord Lucan continues. The odds . suggest if fresh evidence keeps surfacing he might be found sooner . rather than later.' At . 9.45pm, Lady Lucan, in great distress, burst into the Plumber’s Arms, . the pub near her home in the exclusive area of Belgravia in central . London. With blood . streaming from several wounds on her head, she cried: ‘Help me, help me, . help me! He’s in the house! He’s murdered my nanny!’ Lady Lucan, who was estranged from her husband, said he had killed their nanny and tried to kill her. Police found the couple’s three . children asleep in their beds, unharmed, and when they went to the . basement they were greeted by a macabre scene. There were rumours that Lucan's gambling friends John Aspinall (pictured) and billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith had helped him flee the country . The . basement lightbulb had been removed, but in the semi-darkness, officers . made out a pool of blood with a man’s footprint in it (a bloodied towel . was in a bathroom), a blood-stained length of lead piping and a mailbag . containing a body. The body was that of Sandra Rivett, the children’s live-in-nanny, who was the same height and build as Lady Lucan. According . to Lady Lucan - living apart from her husband and in a bitter custody . dispute over their children - she’d gone into the house to look for the . nanny, but was attacked by her husband, whom she recognised by his . voice, before managing to flee. When . she returned with police, Lucan was gone. After the attack, he went to . the home of friends, telling them he had found the nanny had been . murdered. He left his friends at 1.15am. Three days later his car was found . abandoned in Newhaven, East Sussex, with bloodstains on the front seat . and a length of lead piping matching the one found in the Belgravia . basement. There was . speculation that he had committed suicide, but no body was found. And . there were rumours that his gambling friends John Aspinall and . billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith had helped him flee the country. Two . years later, Aspinall gave an interview in which he said that if Lucan . had sought his help he would have given it unconditionally. By then, the inquest into Sandra . Rivett’s death had been held and Lucan was named as her murderer. The . missing peer was declared legally dead in 1999. Inscription: The engraved watch thought to belong to Lord 'Lucky' Lucan . The watch: Antiques dealer Cedrick . Lincoln provided physical evidence to back up old claims when he found a watch . engraved with Lord Lucan's name. He bought the timepiece - apparently presented to Lucan as a gift . from friends at The Clermont Club in Mayfair, London - from a dealer who claims that it was discovered in a South African township. The tickets: . Jill Findlay, a personal assistant to Lucan's friend John Aspinall, . told the BBC that she arranged tickets for Lucan's children to travel to . Kenya and Gabon, so 'their father would observe them... just to see how they were growing up’, on at least two occasions. The brother: Lucan's brother Hugh Bingham recently gave an interview in which said he was 'sure' the elusive . aristocrat fled to start a new life after murdering his children's nanny . Sandra Rivett, 29, in Belgravia, south west London in 1974. The Englishman in Goa: Duncan MacLaughlin, a former Scotland Yard detective, claimed to have traced Lucan to Goa, India. He found photos of a man bearing a striking resemblance to the fugitive. The man in the photos was known locally as Barry Halpin but died in 1996. The eccentric expat: In 2007, the New Zealand Herald reported claims that Lord Lucan was living in an old Land Rover outside the township of Marton. Neighbours suspected expat Roger Woodgate was the missing Lord. When confronted with the claims Mr Woodgate said: 'It's a load of old poppycock. For a start, I'm ten years younger than Lucan. I'm also five inches shorter. If anyone can see a likeness in me and him, I'm more than happy to let them dream on.'","George Bingham DID go on Africa trip where Lucan 'watched from afar'

Martin and Sybrina Fulton have not ruled out meeting George Zimmerman . in the future, but are wary of his motives at this time, their lawyer . said. 'There may be a time . and place for that, but not now,' said Justin Campbell, an assistant to . family attorney Benjamin Crump, in an emailed statement late yesterday. 'Question motives': The parents of shot teenager Trayvon Martin, Tracy Martin (left) and Sybrina Fulton (right), have refused to meet their son's killer George Zimmerman ahead of his bond hearing . Confrontation: Neighbourhood watch volunteer . Zimmerman (left) has been charged with the second-degree murder of . 17-year-old Trayvon (right) in Stanford, Florida, in February. Zimmerman . claims it was self-defence . 'We believe (the) Zimmerman request is . very self-serving, considering the timing of it 50 days later, right . before his bond hearing.' He . said that Zimmerman has never apologized on his website or on . voicemails that he left friends or expressed remorse during interviews . with authorities. 'With Zimmerman now making this request, the family questions his motives and sincerity,' he added. Meanwhile, Trayvon's parents attended a town hall meeting at the Beulah Baptist Institutional Church in Tampa yesterday where they were offered condolences from a 400-strong crowd over their loss. Staying strong: Tracy and Sybrina are offered support and condolences over the loss of their son by a 400-strong crowd at a town hall meeting at the Beulah Baptist Institutional Church in Tampa yesterday . Comforted: Sybrina (left) gets a hug from a supporter. She and Trayvon's father Tracy believe Zimmerman's request for a meeting on the eve of his bond hearing is 'self-serving' Supported: Tracy Martin (pictured) says Zimmerman has not once apologised or expressed remorse over the death of his son Trayvon . They also heard from a panel of speakers who discussed the difficulties of prosecuting a case relating the 'stand-your-ground' law. Zimmerman admits shooting the 17-year-old during a confrontation in February, but claims self-defence under the state law, which eliminates a person's duty to retreat under threat of death or serious injury. Legal experts say the . neighborhood watch volunteer stands a good chance of being granted bail . at today's hearing despite being charged with the second-degree murder. Whether Zimmerman is allowed to . leave the county as he awaits trial - and how he would remain safe - are . two questions likely to be at the center of the hearing at the Seminole . County Criminal Justice Center. 'Although . it's not routine for people charged with murder to get bond, they do . get bond, and I think there is an excellent argument to be made in his . specific case for him to be released on bond,' said defense attorney . Randy McClean, who practices in Seminole County, about 15 miles . northeast of Orlando. Demanding justice: Supporters outside the Beulah Baptist Institutional Church, where the community and experts discussed the difficulties of prosecuting a case relating to the state's 'stand-your-ground' law . Zimmerman . has several factors in his favor. For one, he has ties to the local . community including family members who are expected to testify by . telephone on his behalf at Friday's hearing. He . turned himself in voluntarily after second-degree murder charges were . filed against him last week, a good indication that he doesn't pose a . flight risk. He has never been convicted of a crime, which suggests that he doesn't pose a threat to society, legal experts said. 'It's . hard for a prosecutor to argue he will leave, when up to this point he . has been cooperative and everyone knows who he is,' said Stacey . Honowitz, a veteran prosecutor in Broward County. A spokeswoman for special . prosecutor Angela Corey's office said she wouldn't comment on whether . Corey would object to Zimmerman being released on bond. Zimmerman's safety weighed on the mind of his defense attorney right after he took on the case last week. Mark . O'Mara indicated he would ask that Zimmerman be allowed to leave the . area, if he is granted bond, because of those concerns. Circuit . Judge Kenneth Lester was assigned the case Wednesday after a previous . judge recused herself because of a potential conflict of interest. 'Normally, the conditions are that you stay local. I think that is going to be difficult,' O'Mara said in an interview. 'I . think nobody would deny the fact that if George Zimmerman were walking . down the street today, he would be at risk. That is a reality.' O'Mara has also said he would prefer that Zimmerman be released so he can assist in building a defense case. The . judge would have discretion to allow Zimmerman to live elsewhere along . with a number of restrictions such as a curfew, regular reporting . requirement and possibly an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, said . Florida International University law professor Joelle Moreno. Protest: A woman holds a sign outside the church yesterday as the community convened to discuss the case . 'That . would be the kind of low-cost agreement between Zimmerman and the court . that might make sense, so we're not talking about police protection for . an extended period of time,' Moreno said. O'Mara said he would ask for assistance from law enforcement. Kim . Cannaday, a spokeswoman for the Seminole County Sheriff's Office, said . she couldn't comment on what security procedures will be in place for . Zimmerman if he is released. The . sheriff's office does have the ability to monitor defendants outside . the county if a judge requests a GPS monitor to be used as a condition . of release. 'I want him to . be safe,' O'Mara said. 'I want him to get to his trial so that a judge . or jury, or the prosecutor and I, can figure out a way to resolve this.' Calling for release: Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara (right), pictured at a court hearing last week, says he wants his client (centre) to be allowed out on bail so they can work together on a defense case . There . is only so much that law enforcement can do to help protect Zimmerman, . though, if he is released from jail, said Michael Grieco, a former . Miami-Dade County prosecutor who is now in private practice. 'There is no mechanism in which a defendant is entitled to an around-the-clock detail,' Grieco said. 'The . irony is that the only safe place for him, considering the current . atmosphere surrounding the case, is protective custody within the jail . system.' Jail inmates are separated from other inmates when there is a belief they could face threats. Zimmerman . has been in protective custody since he entered the Seminole County . jail more than a week ago after turning himself into authorities. Witnesses . in cases involving violence or threats are frequently afforded . protection, but police officers and prosecutors have no special . responsibility to protect Zimmerman once he is out of jail, said . Jennifer Zedalis, a University of Florida law professor and former . public defender in Gainesville. 'If he gets out, the primary responsibility to protect Zimmerman would be on Zimmerman,' Zedalis said. Scene: The encounter which led to Trayvon's death took place on the secluded walkway on the right of this picture of a gated community in Sanford, Florida . Zimmerman . is charged with second-degree murder in the 17-year-old Martin's death . during a February 26 confrontation in a Sanford, Florida, gated . community. Martin was . walking home from a convenience store when Zimmerman spotted him from . his truck and called police to report him as suspicious. Zimmerman . has claimed self-defense under Florida's 'stand-your-ground' law, which . eliminates a person's duty to retreat under threat of death or serious . injury. The lack of an . arrest for 44 days spurred protests nationwide, several in Seminole . County, in which participants chanted and held signs that said, 'Arrest . Zimmerman Now!' Anger . over a delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to the Sanford police chief . stepping down temporarily and the recusal of the prosecutor who normally . handles cases out of Sanford. Sanford city officials were holding a . town hall meeting Thursday to address some of the residual anger from . the case. Under typical . bond conditions, Zimmerman would likely have a curfew, be prohibited . from contacting Martin's family and not be allowed to consume alcohol . and non-prescription drugs. He also may be required to wear an electronic monitoring device, which he would most likely have to pay for. Even . if Zimmerman is granted bond, his family may not be able to afford it, . given that it generally can range from $10,000 to $100,000 for a . second-degree murder charge. Zimmerman's . parents are retired, and their house in Lake Mary, Fla., is valued at . just under $120,000, according to the Seminole County Property . Appraiser. 'They are not a family of means, so that is going to be difficult,' O'Mara said.","Couple questions killer's 'motives and sincerity', says lawyer .

Greenpeace activists have staged an hour-long rooftop protest at computer giant Apple's European headquarters - protesting at the electricity burned by 'cloud' data centres. As more and more companies store data online, huge data centres use increasing amounts of electricity to store this information - arousing the ire of green activists. The group claims some burn as much as 250,000 homes - and scaled Apple's to protest. Ironically, Apple's is powered by clean energy. Greenpeace activists scale the Apple headquarters offices in Cork City to demand that the company switches from coal to renewable energy sources to power their cloud computing data center . A number of protesters scaled the Apple building in Holyhill at around 7am and voluntarily came down after an hour . Apple says that the activist group's actions were targeted at data centres which are in fact among the 'greeenest' ever built. 'Our data center in North Carolina will draw about 20 megawatts at full capacity, and we are on track to supply more than 60% of that power on-site from renewable sources including a solar farm and fuel cell installation which will each be the largest of their kind in the country,' said a spokesperson today. 'We believe this industry-leading project will make Maiden the greenest data center ever built, and it will be joined next year by our new facility in Oregon running on 100% renewable energy.' Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace International executive director, said customers of some of the world leading IT and internet companies want to know the companies' energy policies are sustainable. ‘When people around the world share their music or photos on the cloud, they want to know that the cloud is powered by clean, safe energy,’ he said. A number of protesters scaled the Apple building in Holyhill at around 7am and voluntarily came down after an hour. Gardai and the fire service were called to the scene and other activists distributed leaflets to staff. Greenpeace, which praised Apple's energy policy in Ireland, also staged protests over cloud computing centres in Turkey and Luxembourg. It is angered over the use of coal generated energy for new cloud sites. Iris Cheng, campaigner from Greenpeace International, said some major IT companies are not innovative enough about how they power their centres. ‘Coal is one of the dirtiest fuels on the planet, causing untold damage to the environment and global climate,’ she said. Gardai look on as Greenpeace activists scale the Apple HQ offices in Cork City and display a clear message 'Clean Our Cloud' ‘A company that prides itself for its vision and innovation should not be using outdated polluting coal. ‘The irony here in Cork is that Apple's HQ is powered by renewable energy sources. The much needed jobs this HQ provides to the local community are also increasing the jobs in the Irish renewable energy sector. Apple has shown it can power with clean energy in Cork, it is now time to clean up globally.’ Ireland is increasingly becoming an important base for cloud computing with the Government and investors highlighting the cool climate and westerly weather patterns as a big draw.

It went on to become Britain’s biggest medical . recruitment firm. But mother-of-four Miss Bleasdale is . pursuing Healthcare Locums for sex discrimination, claiming her former . chairman touched her breast twice and felt her leg during a meeting in a . London bar. She is also claiming unfair dismissal . after she says she was unfairly blamed for a financial crisis that . engulfed the company, leading to £10million losses. She was executive . vice chairman of Healthcare Locums. In her evidence to a central London . employment tribunal, Miss Bleasdale described how her former chairman . became increasingly hostile towards her after behaving inappropriately . at a meeting in a London bar. She said in her witness statement to . the tribunal: ‘Alan Walker was pretty drunk when he arrived. He sat on . my right side, and touched my right breast twice during the meeting. He . also touched my leg and grabbed my hand on a couple of occasions during . the conversation.’ The hearing was told that she sent an . email to a colleague the following day that read: ‘Was it me or was Alan .

Mr Walker, whose subsequent behaviour towards her became increasingly . hostile, she said. ‘Following this, there was a notable change in Alan . Walker towards me.

Under cross-examination, Miss . Bleasdale admitted joking with board members about suing her colleagues . for sex discrimination, months before launching her legal claim. The businesswoman was also accused of . using inappropriate language in accusing Mr Walker of being ‘frisky’, . and it is alleged on a separate occasion she suggested two strip clubs . as suitable places to take clients. She told the hearing the use of the word ‘frisky’ in fact underplayed Mr Walker’s behaviour.

Doctors in the future might tell patients, 'I'm afraid this is going to require surgery' - then hand over a pill that will do the surgery from inside the body. A breakthrough at Stanford has created a Fantastic Voyage-style vehicle that can 'swim' through a patient's veins, powered wirelessly by electromagnetic waves from doctors from outside. Previous prototypes have been hampered by large batteries - but the new machine is around the size of a grain of rice. A transmitter outside the body sends electromagnetic waves which induce power in a coil in the 3mm device, which then powers a motor that propels it through the body . Racquel Welch in the classic 1966 sci fi Fantastic Voyage: The film envisaged a team of surgeons being 'shrunk' to fit inside the body . The device could deliver drugs, perform surgery, or just take on 'reconnaissance missions' which would otherwise require invasive endoscope treatments. The current prototype chip is only three millimeters wide and four millimeters long. This week, at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference, Professor Ada Poon demonstrated a tiny, wirelessly powered, self-propelled medical device capable of controlled motion through blood. 'Such devices could revolutionize medical technology,' said Poon. 'Applications include everything from diagnostics to minimally invasive surgeries.' Poon's most recent creation, could travel through the bloodstream to deliver drugs, perform analyses, and perhaps even zap blood clots or remove plaque from sclerotic arteries. The idea of implantable medical devices is not new, but most of today's implements are challenged by the size of their batteries, which are large and heavy and must be replaced periodically. Fully half the volume of most of these devices is consumed by battery. An induced current provides the power - which keeps the device small enough to 'swim' through the bloodstream . The chip is so tiny it can swim through blood vessels, controlled by electromagnetic waves from outside the body . Angela Poon's team hope that their discovery could revolutionise treatment of illnesses that are currently resistant to surgery . 'While we have gotten very good at shrinking electronic and mechanical components of implants, energy storage has lagged in the move to miniaturize,' said co-author Teresa Meng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science. 'This hinders us in where we can place implants within the body and also creates the risk of corrosion or broken wires, not to mention replacing aging batteries.' Poon's devices are different. They consist of a radio transmitter outside the body sending signals inside the body to an independent device that picks up the signal with an antenna of coiled wire. The transmitter and the antennae are magnetically coupled such that any change in current flow in the transmitter produces a voltage in the other wire – or, more accurately, it induces a voltage. The power is transferred wirelessly. It can be used to run electronics on the device and propel it through the bloodstream.","3mm chip can 'swim' through blood vessels .

Hundreds of brands in Britain's supermarket carry the Red Tractor food assurance label, but it is now under fire for scoring the lowest animal welfare standards of any quality mark, according to a new report. The label's animal welfare practices have led the authors of the 60-page report to advise shoppers to look for schemes which scored higher in their treatment of animals. The damning report into assurance schemes in the UK was carried out by two charities, Compassion in World Farming and OneKind. The Farm Assurance Scheme and Animal Welfare research, found that the Red Tractor, Britain's biggest food label, officially known as Assured Food Standards, did little more than meet legal requirements. The two charities behind the report, advised consumers to buy meat carrying the RSPCA or Soil Association logo. The Assured Food Standards logo guarantees basic British standards, which are higher than imports from some countries with lower welfare legislation. It achieved a low score in the study for areas including pigs mutilations with the report recommending the 'prohibition of mutilations of pigs, or at least stringent restrictions on mutilations.' It also stated the label should introduce 'a requirement to use anaesthetic for tail docking and a requirement to use teeth grinding instead of teeth clipping.' Joyce D’Silva, of Compassion in World Farming said 'All too often the farmers turn to routine tail docking of piglets to avoid tail biting rather than addressing the cause of the problem – lack of enrichment. Routine tail docking is not only painful, it’s illegal. 'Compassion in World Farming urges British pig farmers not only to follow the law, but to go beyond it and provide the best possible conditions for their pigs,' she added. Criticism: The Red Tractor food label was criticised for allowing pig tail-docking without anaesthetic . Tail . docking is carried out on approximately 80 per cent of piglets in the . UK to try to reduce the risk of tail biting when they are older. Tail biting, which may be a symptom of physical or mental stress, is painful and can lead to serious injury. The law prohibits the routine docking . of piglets’ tails, but it can be carried out provided other measures . have been taken first to try to reduce tail biting. These include providing environmental . enrichment material (e.g. straw), providing more space per pig, and . increasing the amount of feeding space available. Farmers say docking is necessary to . prevent infection as a result of bites from fellow animals. To dock, farmers cut off a portion of the tail with a pair of pliers or a knife, frequently without anaesthetic. Source: RSPCA . The Red Tractor label which is shown on £12bn worth of food annually, was generally given 'Major improvement needed' in nearly every category.' It was recommended to improve in . categories such as providing more space for animals and reducing the . time the animals spent in transportation and achieved low scores for genetically modified or cloned animals as well as tethering of sheep and cattle. The report graded the labels according to bronze, silver and gold level ratings. Bronze meant the label achieved a score of 50 per cent or higher and means it offered  an acceptable standard of welfare, but with many important issues still unresolved. Silver is achieved if the label manages to obtain 70 per cent or higher and offers a good standard, but still has areas which need improving. And gold standard is awarded if the label offers a high standard of welfare and achieves 90 per cent or over. In the summary, the report concluded: . 'The Assured Food Standards (AFS) schemes generally scored poorly. Free-range standards for broiler . chickens and turkeys achieved abronze farming system rating but . neither these standards, nor any of the other AFS schemes, achieved an . overall scheme rating for anyspecies. 'The AFS standards offer few welfare . benefits compared with standard industry practice and generally only . ensure compliance with minimum legislative requirements (the . interpretation of which is considered inadequate in some cases).' Other labels tested include Lion . Mark, RSPCA Freedom and Food Soil Association - the latter scored . extremely highly and achieved a gold standard. It . came first place of the schemes analysed across all species. The . farming system was rated gold for pigs and laying hens and silver for . all other species. Overall, the Soil Association scheme was rated silver for all . species, except sheep, for which it was rated bronze. The report . recommended that it improved its score in killing surplus male animals. Coming in at second place, the RSPCA . Freedom Food Scheme achieved good scores for all species, and overall . the scheme was rated bronze. The RSPCA scheme consistently out-performed . the other schemes in certain areas, but still has recommended points . for improvement such as adequate outdoor space for animals. Under scrutiny: The report also tested labels such as (l-r) Lion Mark, RSPCA Freedom and Soil Association - the latter scored extremely highly and achieved a gold standard .

It is biased and inaccurate and several statements about Red Tractor are just plain wrong. It is not a report by independent experts it is propaganda from a campaign group. 'The report has created a theoretical ‘ideal standard’ against which it measures the schemes.  Their benchmark is totally unrealistic, in most cases not even the most expensive organic products meet them.  The report has no regard for the cost of production and what shoppers can afford.  It is no more realistic than a motoring report that suggests that everyone should buy a Ferrari,' he added.","Also allowed tethering of sheep and cattle and genetically modified animals .

A student nurse is campaigning to lower the age for cervical cancer screening after she was diagnosed with the disease when she was just 20 years old. Hannah Booth, 22, has started a petition to lower the age of screening from 25 back to 20 and has so far collected 7,000 signatures. Once the student from De Montfort University collects 10,000 she will take it to Downing Street. Petition: Hannah wants routine smear tests to be offered from the age of 20 in England like it is in Scotland . Hannah, who has a four-year-old daughter Jayleigh, was diagnosed with the cancer two years ago. She had a hysterectomy to remove two tumours, which gave her the best chance of survival. Ms Booth decided to become a nurse after battling with the disease and hopes, once qualified, she will be able to care for people in a similar situation. 'Having been through the illness myself, I want people to understand how important the issue is and that people my age can get cervical cancer,' she said . 'Up until the age of 18, girls can have the HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and then at 25 routine screening starts - but in between those ages there’s nothing to prevent or detect the disease.' Hannah, who had a hysterectomy, said: 'I am so lucky that I already have my daughter' The mother of one said she went to her GP after showing symptoms of the disease and it was confirmed by a smear test. 'If I’d have waited until 25 then I probably wouldn’t be here now - which is terrifying,' she said. 'When I went into hospital to have my hysterectomy the nurses and carers on the ward were absolutely brilliant and it was then that I decided I wanted to become a nurse. 'I know I can’t have any more children but I am so lucky that I already have my daughter and I look forward to becoming a nurse and caring for people who are battling similar illnesses.' Once Hannah has collect enough signatures, she hopes to cycle the 100 mile trip from Leicester to London to deliver the petition and raise money for charity. She said: 'I urge people to sign my petition and help make a difference. Changing the screening age could save lives and that’s worth a few minutes of anyone’s time. The age for routine cervical screening was raised from 20 to 25 in England in 2003 after a review concluded that screening under-25s would do more harm than good.  Scotland and Wales still do routine smear tests at 20.

A paralysed man accused of killing his wife and mother-in-law made legal history yesterday when he went on trial for murder from a hospital bed. Sergei Zolotovsky, 44, was left paralysed when he twice attempted suicide after he allegedly stabbed his estranged wife Svetlana Zolotovska, 40 – and her mother Antonina Belska, 70 – to death when she was awarded the family home after a bitter divorce. Yesterday he became the first person to be brought to court in a hospital bed after being wheeled in on a trolly and positioned in front of the dock. Legal history: This court drawing shows suspected double murderer Sergei . Zolotovsky in his hospital bed beside the jury box at the Old Bailey . today. He denied charges of brutally murdering his estranged wife and . mother-in-law . Zolotovsky, 44, a plumber, is alleged to have stabbed Svetlana at a bus stop in Beckton before going back to the family home and killing Ms Belska. Ms Belska’s body was discovered by firefighters called to the semi-detached house when neighbours spotted flames. Zolotovsky is said to have been found by police in the loft at the house, having apparently tried to cut his own throat. He underwent emergency surgery and recovered but then suffered further injuries which led to him becoming bedridden. Judge Stephen Kramer told the jury of six men and six women about the ‘unusual circumstances’ of the case before the trial got underway. He said: ‘As you can see, and as you were told when you were empanelled, the defendant is unusually in a bed and not in the dock. ‘Prosecution counsel will shortly open the case to you - in other words, she will tell you what the Crown say this case is about. ‘When she opens the case to you, you will hear that Mr Zolotovsky tried to commit suicide before he was arrested by police. ‘He cut his wrists. He made a second attempt to kill himself when he was in custody. As a result he sustained extensive injuries, including extensive paralysis. ‘That is why he is in a bed. He is unable to sit in the dock in the normal way. That is by way of an explanation to the unusual circumstances pertaining to this court.’ The ambulance bringing Zolotovsky to the Old Bailey today: It is believed to be the first time a suspect has faced charges there from his hospital bed . Zolotovsky, of Edmonton Green, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of murder. He lay propped up in the bed today, fully clothed and wearing black with a white shirt, his arms folded across his chest. Asked to confirm his name by the court clerk, he replied: 'Yes.' Svetlana Zolotovsky worked as a pharmacy technician in the private Wellington Hospital in  St John’s Wood. Preparations for the historic case began when cleaners were brought in last week to make the 50-year-old courtroom as hygienic as possible. Court 16 was chosen as the biggest and most accessible courtroom in the more modern half of the Old Bailey building. The trial of three men accused of shooting five-year-old Thusha Kamaleswaran, who was left paralysed as the innocent victim of alleged gang warfare in Stockwell in March last year, was moved next door to accommodate the Zolotovsky case. The ambulance bringing Zolotovsky to court arrived at the judge’s entrance in Warwick Square, which is located away from the public entrance to the courts complex.

A girl of five died from  meningitis only 24 hours after she was twice diagnosed with a bug and sent home by doctors. Kelsey Smart was initially taken to an out-of-hours emergency GP after she developed a red rash across her stomach. The next morning, the schoolgirl’s own doctor told her worried mother that she was merely suffering from a bug and sent her home without any medication. However, just hours later Kelsey began to have fits. Despite emergency surgery, she died from meningitis in hospital early the next day. Last night her devastated parents Jamie and Hannah said they believed their daughter could have survived  if doctors had acted more quickly. ‘If she had gone to the hospital  after she saw the GP then she could still be alive,’ Mr Smart said. ‘I have spoken to the charity Meningitis UK  and they told me if a child that age exhibits those symptoms they should be given penicillin and sent to hospital straight away.’ Kelsey first started being sick on February 25 and continued to be ill the next day. Although still alert, she was tired, and could not eat or keep any drink down. That evening Mrs Smart took her to the emergency GP service Frendoc, where Kelsey was examined. Mrs Smart, 24, from Kingswood, Bristol, said: ‘Kelsey had a pinprick rash on her belly. I wondered if it was chickenpox as that has been going through my son’s playgroup. I didn’t think for a second it might be meningitis. Hannah and Jamie Smart with their son Jayden after their five-year-old girl Kelsey lost her life to meningitis . ‘The out-of-hours doctor told me to go to my own GP in the morning. I phoned up at 8am and was told I was in queue position 13. I eventually saw a GP, who again said it was a bug and so we went home.’ Later that day, as Kelsey began to grow increasingly restless, her mother decided to take her to the children’s hospital, where 34-year-old Mr Smart was working as a painter and decorator. On the way, Kelsey started to have fits so her mother stopped the car and called 999. At the hospital, Kelsey was given morphine and anti-inflammatory drugs after doctors feared she may have had a stroke. A neurosurgeon also operated  on her to . try to remove fluid from the brain, but the disease had taken hold. She . was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial strain of the . disease. Tragic Kelsey suffered a fit in her mother's car on the way to Bristol Children's Hospital, where she died . Shortly before her death, Kelsey was christened. She died surrounded by . her parents and her Hello Kitty toys, and listening to her favourite . singer Justin Bieber. Mr Smart said: ‘We have had lots of support from family and friends, . from local MPs and from around the country, and if this raises awareness . to help another child that would be good. ‘We want to do what we can to make other parents aware of the signs of meningitis.’ Kelsey’s parents, who also have a  two-year-old son Jayden, donated . their daughter’s organs. They  have been told her heart has already been . given to a child and that five others will also be helped. Her mother said: ‘We couldn’t let her go to waste. She was beautiful.’ Mark Dee, headmaster of Park Primary School, where Kelsey was a year-one . pupil, said: ‘This is a tragic and devastating time and our thoughts go . out to Kelsey’s family. ‘She was such a lovely little girl who found joy in all that she did.

A housewife tried to murder a five-year-old boy by dragging him into the path of an oncoming train, a court has heard. Radhika Sharma, 35, jumped in front of a locomotive as horrified commuters looked on at one of London’s busiest stations. The driver slammed on the brakes but was powerless to stop the pair disappearing from view, Snaresbrook Crown Court was told. Shocking: A housewife tried to murder a five-year-old boy by dragging him into the path of an oncoming train at Stratford station in London, pictured, a court has heard . Both miraculously escaped uninjured when the engine passed harmlessly overhead and its wheels failed to hit them. The emergency services were called to the scene at Stratford station, east London, where Sharma allegedly explained to a paramedic that she had only been trying to kill herself. She had been spoken to by police earlier that day for allegedly grabbing the boy and swinging him in front of an oncoming train at Forest Gate station, east London. CCTV showed the 2.44pm service on June 10 last year being forced to brake hard to avoid hitting the child, it was said.

A drug-crazed thug who battered a nursery nurse so badly her own mother failed to recognise her because of her blood-soaked hair has been jailed for 12 years. Katey Wall was forced to play dead after Matthew Atkins punched the back of her head repeatedly after he pounced as she walked home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire. Her injuries were so bad her mother did not recognise her when she met her daughter's ambulance as it reached hospital, especially because the blood had stained her blonde locks a shocking red. The 25-year-old punched her repeatedly for 10 minutes and only stopped beating Miss Wall, 24, after a member of the public walked past in the early hours of July 30 last year. Now and then: Katey Wall, left, was so badly beaten that her usual blonde hair was left bright red because she lost so much blood from her head in the attack, right . There was so much blood at the scene that when paramedics arrived they initially believed she had been stabbed. The judge said in court that if it had not been Miss Wall who was attacked he would have assaulted another woman that night. 'I wasn’t aware anyone was following me,' she said. 'I heard a couple of footsteps and someone put their hand over my mouth from behind. When I turned around I realised I didn’t know him and he kept his hand over my mouth and was pinching my nose. 'It was a struggle at first, I was throwing my arms everywhere and screaming but he had his hand over my mouth. 'I was face down and he was using my hair to bash my head on the floor really hard. I thought that was it, I thought I was going to die. Thug: Matthew Atkins has been jailed for 12 years after ferociously attacking Katey Wall in July last year . 'So I thought maybe if I do play dead and stop breathing, he might go away. He was listening for my breathing and eventually I let out a gasp, then he kept on banging my head off the floor. 'I’m just relieved it’s over. It was never going to be enough no matter what he got. 'I’ll just go home and try to get back to normal now.' She was rushed to Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, where she had nine stitches to wounds in the back of her head. 'My hair was exactly the same colour as it is now (blonde). There was a lot of blood,' she said. 'When they opened the ambulance doors my own mum didn’t even recognise me. My hair was completely red. 'I’ve had really bad nightmares and I won’t go out in the dark on my own anymore. It’s changed my life in that way.' Atkins was jailed for 12 years at Shrewsbury Crown Court after he admitted unlawfully and maliciously wounding with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm. The court heard he had snorted at least three grams of cocaine and downed booze before launching the unprovoked attack. Atkins was told he would serve at least nine years before being released. Jailing him Judge Robin Onions said: 'She was a lady and she was a vulnerable victim. It must have been a terrifying incident. 'This was a horrific offence. You went out on the night in question and chose to take with you two grams of cocaine. 'During the course of that evening you had taken probably over three grams of cocaine. You were effectively out of control such that you had no control over your behaviour. 'She was a lady and she was a vulnerable victim. It must have been a terrifying incident,' Judge Robin Onions, pictured, said in court . 'I can only presume this was a targeted attack. Not that you targeted Miss Wall, but that you targeted a girl.' The court heard Atkins targeted her as she walked home in the early hours after a night out with friends in Bridgnorth, Shropshire. Phillip Beardwell, prosecuting, told the court Atkins left Katey in a pool of blood before ditching his blood-stained pink jumper and trainers in a car park. He then made his way across Bridgnorth and broke into a detached garage at someone’s home where he stole a pair of golf shoes and a high visibility jacket. He was arrested by police at his home the next day after fingerprints found at the garage matched his own. Mr Beardwell said: 'Mr Atkins had by all accounts consumed a large amount of drugs and alcohol that evening. 'It was a random, isolated attack. She (Miss Wall) thought she was going to die. 'The bleeding caused her hair to effectively change colour to an almost red because of the amount of blood that had seeped through.' The court heard Atkins claimed he launched a frenzied attack on Katey Wall after snorting a bad batch of cocaine. Jonathan Challinor, defending, said: ‘Matthew Atkins took with him to the social club two grams of cocaine and he consumed it. ‘Coupled with the consumption of cocaine was the consumption of a very large amount of alcohol. ‘One of the theories for his conduct and behaviour is the cocaine, which he got from a stranger. ‘One can hazard a guess that it caused this defendant to behave in a way that he had never behaved when taking cocaine previously. ‘What he did has no obvious explanation whatsoever. The bizarre behaviour occurred afterwards as well. The next recollection of Matthew Atkins is waking up in a farmers field some way away.’ Mr Challinor went on to describe Atkins behaviour as ‘utterly out of character and totally inexplicable’ - saying he had a strong network of family and friends who trusted him with their children. He added: ‘He’s a young man who is prepared to change and change for the better. 'He has made it plain his absolute disgust at his own conduct that evening. 'Everyone who knows this defendant simply can’t believe he as committed an offence of this nature.'","Katey Wall was beaten for ten minutes by thug Matthew Atkins who randomly attacked her as she walked home .

"By . Rebecca Camber . UPDATED: . 02:21 EST, 8 September 2011 . Quizzed: Amelia Hill, a Guardian journalist, has been questioned over allegations she aided and abetted misconduct in a public office . A journalist from the Guardian has been  questioned by detectives investigating sensitive  leaks from within Scotland Yard’s phone hacking inquiry team. Amelia Hill, who was first with the information that the News of the World  hacked into  Milly Dowler’s phone, was interviewed under caution about the passing of confidential details of the investigation to the newspaper. Miss Hill, 37, is understood to have formed a friendship with an officer on the hacking inquiry, codenamed Operation Weeting. The 51-year-old officer has been suspended and Miss Hill was questioned over suspicions that she might have aided and abetted misconduct in a public office. As part of their investigation, detectives will also try to establish whether the suspended officer received any expenses paid for passing the information. Miss Hill is believed to have become close to the officer after she interviewed him in connection with another story. The development is embarrassing for the paper, whose coverage of the hacking scandal prompted a public inquiry into journalistic standards. In July, Miss Hill broke the Guardian’s Milly Dowler story – described as a ‘tipping point’ in the scandal – which revealed that private investigators working for the tabloid hacked the voicemails of the murdered Surrey schoolgirl after she went missing in 2002. And last month she reported the arrest of News of the World reporter James Desborough before he had even been formally detained by police. The alleged source of these police leaks was arrested at his desk. The officer was said to have called the Guardian in a panic that night asking to speak to Miss Hill. Breaking news: Hill first reported that Milly Dowler's phone had been hacked, before reporting on James Desborough's arrest before he was formally detained . News International has asked a technology firm to delete emails and other documents 13 times since 2009, MPs investigating the phone-hacking scandal have been told. Technology company HCL, which provides services under contract to News International, informed the Commons Home Affairs Committee in August that it was aware of the deletion of hundreds of thousands of emails on nine occasions between April 2010 and July 2011, but said it did not know of anything 'untoward' behind the requests. Today, HCL's solicitor Stuart Benson contacted the committee again to say that a further four requests had come to light - one of which related to the deletion of emails from an inbox of a user who had not accessed his account for eight years. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'The request for deletion of folders and emails by News International is concerning.' Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers, in charge of Operation Weeting, was furious at the constable’s alleged ‘unauthorised disclosure’, breaking a confidentiality agreement signed by all Operation Weeting officers. Detectives will be closely examining phone records of the arrested detective in relation to a number of stories written by Miss Hill. On Monday, she appeared on Sky News to preview the newspaper front pages. She claimed that the Guardian had uncovered a number of documents and tapes in relation to the hacking inquiry. Dan Roberts, the paper’s national news editor, said on Twitter that it was a ‘bleak day for journalism when reporter behind vital hacking revelations is criminalised for doing her job’. Nick Davies, who has led the Guardian’s phone-hacking coverage, wrote on the website: ‘Scotland Yard trying to use criminal law to restrict reporting of their own activity.’ A Guardian News & Media spokesman said: ‘Journalists would no doubt be concerned if the police sought to criminalise conversations between off-record sources and reporters. Arrested: The Times' Deputy football editor Raoul Simons was arrested yesterday on suspicion of conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages . 'While we would never comment on any specific confidential source, we can confirm that Amelia Hill has never paid any police officer for information. Given the ongoing police investigation we have nothing further to add.’ In a separate development, police yesterday arrested the deputy football editor of The Times,  Raoul Simons, 35, on suspicion of conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages. He has been on extended leave since September 2010. He is the 16th suspect to be held since the scandal broke. It also emerged yesterday that News International has asked the technology firm HCL to delete emails and other documents 13 times since 2009. HCL informed the Commons Home Affairs Committee in August that it was aware of the deletion of hundreds of thousands of emails between April 2010 and July 2011, but said it knew of nothing ‘untoward’ behind the requests.","Amelia Hill questioned over links to inquiry officer .

Melonie, 17, was only identified this morning after police arrested her biological father Evertone Biddersingh, 56, and stepmother Elaine Biddersingh, 50, on March 5 in Welland, Ontario. On September 1, 1994, police on patrol discovered a body in a burning suitcase left in an industrial area north of Toronto.

Cold case: Melonie Biddersingh, 17, pictured in her native Jamaica, has been identified as the body found in a suitcase in Ontario in 1994 . The only thing they could be certain of was that the female once had curly, black hair. It appeared as if the victim had been killed elsewhere and her remains put in a green suitcase, dumped and set on fire. A forensic pathologist said that the young woman had 21 broken bones, consistent with a car accident or fall from a height, according to CTV News. The injuries were estimated to have taken place up to six months before Miss Biddersingh died and she was not treated, leaving her unable to move and in constant pain. According to Detective Sgt Steve Ryan of the Toronto police homicide squad, the break in the case came with 'a single phone call' from a 'person of conscience'. The police then went to Kingston, Jamaica, where they found Melonie's biological mother Opal Austin. After obtaining a sample of her DNA, they were able to finally confirm Melonie's identity.

Supermarkets have seen a massive drop in the use of plastic bags when they charge for them, it emerged yesterday. Since a 5p levy was introduced across Wales last year, Sainsbury’s has reported a 90 per cent reduction in their use there. Co-op says it has seen a fall of 86 per cent, while Morrisons is down 60 per cent. A thing of the past? The 5p 'bag tax' appears to be changing shoppers' habits as they ditch disposable bags like these for reusable options . The major supermarkets’ figures suggest the policy has led to a huge reduction in the 350million plastic bags previously used annually in Welsh supermarkets. It is a major victory for the Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign, which was launched in 2008 and received enormous support from readers, anti-litter campaigners, the Marine Conservation Society, the National Trust and many other groups. In Wales, shops are now legally bound to enforce a 5p charge – and then pass on the cash to charities. Scourge: The effects of disposable bag use are plain to see on the banks of the Ribble, near Preston, Lancashire . Shops that continue to provide free carrier bags face a fine of up to £5,000. The success of the Welsh initiative is bound to increase pressure on England to ‘banish the bags’ as shoppers switch to bags-for-life to cut down on waste. From next year shoppers will have to pay 5p for their plastic bags in Northern Ireland, increasing to 10p in 2014, while Scotland is considering a similar plan. Ministers are understood to be considering adopting a charge throughout England amid evidence that voluntary measures by stores have failed to deliver promised reductions. Plastic bags are often used only for about 20 minutes, but take up to 1,000 years to rot away, littering the landscape and causing devastation to marine animals and birds, which suffer long painful deaths after ingesting or becoming entangled in them. The Daily Mail launched its Banish the Bags campaign four years . ago . After the Daily Mail launched its Banish the Bags campaign four years ago, Marks & Spencer introduced a 5p charge on all food carrier bags, prompting a huge drop in the number handed out to customers. But last year, large retailers in the UK gave out 6.4billion carrier bags, an increase of 333million in a year. David Cameron has said the recent increase is unacceptable and has warned retailers that government intervention to reduce numbers is possible. Last month it emerged that a ban on free plastic bags across the whole of Europe is being considered by Brussels. The way forward: More customers are opting for reusable cotton bags, while M&S set an example with their own decision to charge 5p per bag .","Pressure mounts on the rest of the UK to follow suit after major supermarkets show remarkable results .

But in death Dimitris Christoulas has become an extraordinary symbol of how Greeks are struggling to cope as their country falls apart under the burden of austerity measures. On Wednesday morning, the 77-year-old former pharmacist walked into Greece’s Syntagma Square, just yards from the nation’s parliament. Fury: Protesters hurl stones against riot police during a protest in memory of an elderly man who commited suicide by shooting himself, at Syntagma central square in the early hours of yesterday . Protest: A woman gestures at riot police outside the Greek parliament last night as police clash with demonstrators at the spot where Dimitris Christoulas died . As thousands of commuters swarmed to work, the pensioner shot himself, deciding to end his life rather than face his final years on the breadline. His death has shocked Greece, even though the nation has already seen suicide rates increase by around 20 per cent in the past two years. Yesterday, police clashed with demonstrators for a second day at the site where Mr Christoulas killed himself in downtown Athens. Several dozen youths dressed in hoods and crash helmets smashed paving stones with hammers and threw the rubble at riot police, chanting ‘Killers! Killers!’ as police responded with tear gas and flash grenades. By yesterday, the spot where Mr Christoulas took his life had become a shrine to the man who is fast becoming a totem for ordinary Greeks trying to exist day-by-day in a country teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Last night, about 1,000 mourners once again gathered at the corner of Syntagma Square where he died, with the spot adorned by flowers and candles. Anger: A woman pushes a riot policeman's shield during a protest in Greece's Syntagma Square last night . Tragic: Mourners gather at the spot where Dimitris Christoulas committed suicide in front of the Greek Parliament . Scores of hand-written notes were also pinned to the tree next to where he fell, bearing messages such as ‘His blood is on your hands, traitors’ and ‘A government of murderers’. Witnesses to the death said the pharmacist declared ‘I don’t want to leave my debts to my children’ before producing a gun and shooting himself in the head at 9am. In the days before his death he had deliberately paid service charges on his apartment several weeks in advance to ensure he left no money owing. In Greece they speak of him becoming the country’s very own Mohammed Bouazizi, the Tunisian fruit and veg seller who started the Arab Spring by setting fire to himself. Others called him a ‘martyr’. Protests: Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos holds a press conference upon his arrival in Cyprus yesterday . The public suicide quickly resonated in a country where successive rounds of salary and pension cuts have created a mood of national despondency, and one in five adults is unemployed – twice the European average. The Greek government is facing almost daily protests against its stringent austerity plans, put in place after the financial crisis put the country in danger of not being able to pay off its huge debts and being ejected from the euro. Following Mr Christoulas’s death, a defiant handwritten one-page suicide note was found on his body, in which he said his pension, which he had contributed to without state help for 35 years, had been slashed. The divorced father-of-one, who had lived alone in a flat, declared ‘I cannot find any other form of struggle except a dignified end’ which was preferable to scavenging through ‘rubbish to feed myself’. Grief: Mourners lay flowers and tributes at the spot where the 77-year-old former pharmacist shot himself dead last night . Anger: Police disperse demonstrators outside the Greek parliament last night after an elderly man shot himself dead . The suicide note also blamed ‘the occupation government of Tsolakoglou’ for forcing him to end his life. Georgios Tsolakoglou was Greece’s first collaborationist prime minister during Germany’s occupation of his country in the Second World War. The reference appears to be a veiled criticism of Germany’s role in enforcing Greece’s current austerity measures. ‘My father’s note leaves no room for misinterpretation. His whole life was spent as a leftist fighter, a selfless visionary,’ said his only daughter, Emy Christoula, 43. ‘This final act was a conscious political act, entirely consistent with what he believed and did in his life.’ She added that, for some, ‘committing suicide is not an escape but a cry of awakening’. One friend, Anthony Skarmoutsos, said: ‘He wanted his suicide to send a political message. He was deeply politicised, but also very angry.’ Another, bookshop owner Elias Tsironis, 50, said Mr Christoulas would spend many an evening at the store discussing politics and the deepening recession, adding: ‘What he did was very courageous. Often it is from the people you least expect that something starts, like a spark.’ Ilias Sirakos, owner of a shop frequented by Mr Christoulas, said: ‘A few days ago, he told a friend that he could not understand this apathy and asked how people could sit around without protesting. He is a hero. It takes guts to do something like that.’ Neighbours suggested Mr Christoulas had been suffering from serious health problems and was struggling to afford medication. Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos issued a statement saying: ‘In these difficult hours for our society we must all – the state and the citizens – support the people among us who are desperate.’ ■ Fears are mounting that the eurozone’s economic crisis could flare up again, despite the most recent bailout of Greece. Spain – the fourth biggest economy in the eurozone – was back in the firing line yesterday, reeling from mass protests, record unemployment and anaemic growth. Unemployment in Spain is the highest in Europe, at 23.6 per cent, while youth unemployment is 50.5 per cent. The national debt looks set to hit nearly 80 per cent of GDP this year – the highest level since at least 1990. Portugal and Ireland also remain on the economic danger list, while Italy is also battling to get its crippling debt burden – 120 per cent of GDP – back under control. Italy’s deficit fell to 3.8 per cent in 2011, from 4.5 per cent in 2010, but the economy has averaged an abysmal 0.75 per cent annual growth rate over the past 15 years.","1,000 mourners gather in the spot where 'martyr' died .

"By . David Richards . UPDATED: . 19:42 EST, 2 October 2011 . Robert Mugabe is secretly receiving medical care at a private hospital in Singapore, it has been reported. Zimbabwe's ailing 87-year-old tyrant, who is believed to be suffering from cancer, travelled to Asia last week according to a report today in Zimbabwe's Standard newspaper. The clandestine trip is reportedly the seventh time this year that the statesman has visited Singapore for treatment. Zimbabwe's government has previously been accused of lying about Mugabe's faltering health in a bid to protect the dictator from adverse publicity . His latest visit was confirmed yesterday by Zimbabwe's media minister Webster Shamu. The minister, a spokesman for Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF, claimed Mugabe had made the journey for a check-up after he previously underwent an operation to remove cataracts from his eyes. Mr Shamu told the Standard the leader was due to return to Harare today. He said: 'He went for a review following an eye operation he had earlier on. He will be back on Sunday.' Zimbabwe's government has previously been accused of lying about Mugabe's faltering health in a bid to protect the dictator from adverse publicity. The Standard reported that the president's office repeatedly claimed he had been receiving eye care when it was widely known he was instead being treated for cancer. U.S. diplomatic wires, revealed by Wikileaks, reported that the country's reserve bank chief Gideon Gono (pictured) said Mugabe had then been given just five years to live and said he could be dead by 2013 . Speculation about Mugabe's health has been rife for several years after the former liberation figure appeared to become increasingly frail. It has heightened in recent weeks following the publication of leaked diplomatic cables which appeared to confirm he was suffering from prostate cancer. The US diplomatic wires, published by Wikileaks, quoted senior Zimbabwean officials who said Mugabe had been diagnosed in 2008. The country's reserve bank chief Gideon Gono even claimed he had then been given just five years to live and told he could be dead by 2013. One cable, sent in 2008 by America's then-ambassador to Zimbabwe James McGee, said: 'Gideon Gono, governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, told the Ambassador on June 4 that President Robert Mugabe has prostate cancer that has metastasised and, according to doctors, will cause his death in three to five years. 'According to Gono, Mugabe's doctor had recommended he cut back on his activities.' Despite the ongoing speculation, Zimbabwe's government has repeatedly denied that the dictator is sick. However many believe his allies have done so amid fears his departure could spark a political battle for succession. Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe with a rod of iron since it gained independence from Britain in 1980. The tyrant has been criticised in the past for using the public purse to fund his private trips abroad. Earlier this year it emerged Mugabe had hugely overspent his travel budget on a string of foreign flights. The despot does not have a private jet but often simply comandeers a plane from Zimbabwe's state-run airline when he wants to travel overseas.",Clandestine trip is said to be seventh time tyrant has headed to Asia for treatment .

Delegates, who have been harangued by militant colleagues over the last few days,  complained they had been ‘distracted’ by ‘canoodling’ going on behind them. This prompted the union’s president, Marilyn Harrop, to reprimand the couple for ‘behaviour unbecoming to our union’. Mrs Harrop seized an opportunity between debates on special needs education and false allegations against teachers to inform  delegates she had received a complaint. She told the conference: ‘Apparently there was an incident in the balcony of a couple behaving in a manner unbecoming to the union. 'I don’t know whether this was because they were bored or whether it was because they were really fired up by the debate. But no more please.’ An NUT spokesman said it was not known whether the pair were teachers or observers, who normally sit in the balcony. ‘There were no lewd acts, and the conference was not shut down or suspended,’  she added. Ms Harrop stressed their actions were far from x-rated. 'There were no lewd acts, the conference was not shut down or suspended.

A taxpayer-funded charity has sparked outrage by giving away free cigarettes as part of an anti-smoking campaign. Tobacco Free Futures sent out packs to highlight how cigarette packaging can lead children to become addicted to smoking. The Merseyside-based charity’s strategy has been blasted by politicians for being 'irresponsible'. Councillor Rosie Jolly, Liverpool council Liberal Democrat shadow cabinet member for children’s services, said: 'I think this sends out mixed messages, and it’s completely contradictory to what is supposed to be being achieved. 'The whole point is to make cigarettes less visible and attractive to children, and here we are doing something that completely contradicts that.' The charity defended its decision, saying they had only sent packs out to a few people in the North West media to draw attention to the dangers of smoking to influential people, including MPs. Each pack costs £20 to send out - and they were sent to around 20 media outlets. Blunder: The charity Tobacco Free Futures sent out around 20 packs of free cigarettes at a cost of £20 each .

A wife and mother said she believes in miracles after sewer workers found the $6,000 custom,made diamond wedding ring that she accidentally flushed down the toilet more than a year ago. Mechelle Rieger accidentally flushed the gold band with seven diamonds down the toilet 18 months ago. Despite her husband Paul disassembling the latrine and going into the plumbing under the house, the ring was nowhere to be found. She claimed the seven-diamond ring this morning at City Hall in Kuna, Idaho, bringing with her a photo and the March 2001 appraisal from the jeweller that made it, kboi2.com originally reported. The ring cycle: Mechelle Rieger, third from left, has been reunited with her $6,000 engagement ring after she accidentally flushed it down the toilet nearly two years ago . Lost and found: Mrs Rieger was able to claim the custom-made ring after bringing proof of ownership from the original jeweller . Mrs Rieger thanked city workers Travis Fleming and Carey Knight, who spotted the ring along with loose coins in a filtration basket while doing routine maintenance last week. Mr Knight, who works alongside Mr Fleming as a sewer worker, told kboi.com that he originally thought the ring was a fake. ‘After I got it cleaned up, I could tell it was real,’ he said. Mr Fleming added that the ring was the rarest find he’s seen in the sewers. Upon broadcasting the report of the found ring, people from around the country called them and tried to convince the workers the ring was theirs. ‘We were getting calls from states all over – even one from Virginia,’ City Hall worker Chris Engles told kboi2.com. Good deed: Kuna city workers Travis Fleming, left, and Carey Knight found the ring and passed it on to City Hall . Mrs Rieger, who was alerted by a friend, was frantic to get her ring back. She rushed to the jeweller in Boise where she had the ring custom-made and requested a certificate to prove ownership. She says there was more screaming involved when she got a voice message from her friend relaying the news about a ring being found in the sewer in her old neighbourhood. Mr Engles said the woman was all smiles when she arrived at City Hall to claim her band. She took pictures with the two workers and thanked them sincerely. But the story only gets better – Mrs Rieger got her ring back just in time, as she and her husband Paul will be celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary in June. ‘Miracles do happen, and I have my ring back,’ she told kboi2.com. Lord of the ring: The band was sealed in a manilla envelope until she claimed it . The dramatic story started a year and a half ago when she was living in Kuna. She told KTVB.com that the ring bounced into the toilet after she flushed. ‘I just started screaming, and I had my hand down in there too.’ 'Miracles do happen, and I have my ring back.' -Mechelle Rieger . Her children, she said, didn’t see her cause for alarm. ‘My kids of course started laughing, because I’m kind of klutzy like that. I just started crying.’ She said that despite its murky year and a half in the sewers, ‘the diamonds are still sparkly as ever.’ Still, she said that she’s planning to get the ring cleaned professionally, and fix the band before she replaces her surrogate ring with the original. Finding the ring was made possible in part because Kuna has updated its sewer treatment in recent years. According to kboi2.com, the city uses a filter basket that collects anything from cheap jewellery to loose change. That basket can collect up to 90 per cent of debris, according to city workers.","Mechelle Rieger lost custom-made ring 18 months ago .

A study found extracts contained in the beverage, reduced concentrations of the hormone by up to 30 per cent. Olympic doping officials have now raised . concerns that athletes could use tea to hide increased levels of testosterone from standard drugs tests. A study found green tea helped reduce the concentration of testosterone . Testosterone is one of the oldest illegal steroids used in sports, and it is commonly used to build muscle. Experts say athletes taking testosterone for doping purposes typically have 200 to 300 percent more in their bodies than normal. During the study, researchers added green . and white tea extracts - or catechins - to the hormone and discovered that they reduced the concentration by almost a third. The recent anomaly could now lead to a change in the tests ahead of this summer's Games. Olivier Rabin, scientific director of the World . Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA said: 'It's interesting that something as . common as tea could have a significant influence on the steroid . profile. 'We may need to adjust our steroid . (test) to allow us to exclude whether a test is modified by food or . training or disease, before we can say that it's doping,' Olympic sprinter, Ben Johnson, was banned from athletics for life after failing a drugs test for the second time in 1993 . The study was conducted in a laboratory so . scientists said it was too early to tell what the effect of green tea . might be in humans, but similar results have . been found in rodent studies. Other foods and beverages, such as alcohol, are also known to muddle test results and WADA has tight controls on other commonly consumed substances like caffeine. 'There's . no reason to think we just happened to pick the only food in the world . that does this,' said Declan Naughton of Kingston University, who . published the findings in the journal, . Steroids. Charles Yesalis, a doping expert at Pennsylvania State University, said officials needed to react quickly. 'Athletes . will not wait for the clinical trials,' he said. 'I'll bet there are . already lots of athletes out there drinking loads of green tea,' he . added. However some experts said the limited effects . of foods like green tea on masking illegal drug use would be too small . to help doping athletes. 'You would probably need to drink the . tea continuously to get any sustained but minor effect,' said Andrew . Kicman, head of research and development at the Drug Control Centre at .

High Street firms have a 'responsibility' to employ more ex-offenders who can be motivated and honest, the Justice Secretary has said. Kenneth Clarke urged businesses, including household names such as Virgin and Marks & Spencer, to hire former prisoners without fear of damaging their reputation or values. Mr Clarke is trying to convince companies to fulfill their 'social responsibility' ahead of Downing Street summit, later this month, where up to 40 companies hear him outline how prisoners can make loyal and committed employees if given the right opportunities upon release from jail. Opportunity: Justice Secretary Ken Clarke, right, seen here talking to prisoners during a visit to Leeds Prison, Armley, Leeds, has said ex offenders can be motivated and honest workers if given a chance . The Government has insisted the scheme is aimed at cutting reoffending rate – which currently sees 47per cent of adult offenders commit another crime within a year. But Mr Clarke there is ‘no reason’ why profits from prisoners' work should not be used to pay for the prisons that house them. He admitted that when he was home . secretary 20 years ago it was difficult to persuade firms that hiring . ex-prisoners ‘could be aligned with the sensible management of a . thriving business’. ‘Actually it makes very great sense,’ he said. ‘You will be able to recruit and train . people who will be highly motivated individuals when they've taken . advantage of the opportunities this kind of thing can present them. ‘We have large numbers of major . companies expressing a strong interest, beginning to get organised, . Virgin, Marks & Spencer.’ Obligation: Companies have a social responsibility to help ex offenders stay out of trouble when they have been release, according to Justice Secretary Ken Clarke . He added: ‘Introducing work experience and training to people who are serving their time and being punished in prison is altogether a more intelligent way of running the prison service.’ ‘There is no doubt that people who get sent to prison have made a mistake, society is entitled to look for them to be punished, but also society should be trying to do something to help those who have the gumption to sort themselves out, to resume an ordinary honest life as decent citizens when they leave. ‘If you just incarcerate people, if prison is just a warehouse in which you keep people and then release them without guidance into the world, it's hardly surprising that half of them will be back within 12 months, having committed more crime. ‘Many prisoners do not want to be part of that cycle. We need to facilitate the way in which people get back into a normal life and do not commit further crimes again.’ He went on: ‘We also stress to the businessmen that you can take part in this and derive benefits as a business and you don't have to compromise your ordinary standards of commercial judgment. ‘I want eventually to see businesses manufacturing, providing services, from prisons on a commercial basis. ‘There's no reason why they shouldn't help pay for themselves and the cost of the prison.’ The Government is working with the CBI to ensure that measures are put in place to guard against unfair competition with ordinary businesses outside the prison gates, he added. Speaking ahead of the launch of ONE3ONE Solutions, which will replace the Prison Industries unit in helping prisoners to improve their job prospects, Mr Clarke said there were 131 prisons across England and Wales where there was the space for some sort of training and work-related experience. ‘Some of that will be organised by what was our Prison Industries but more and more of it (will be) normal household name firms actually doing it as part of their social responsibility and the running of their business.’ Virgin and Marks & Spencer are just two of the major firms interested after Timpson opened its first training academy at a jail four years ago, Mr Clarke said. Prisons Minister Crispin Blunt added: ‘We're trying to get towards a place where instead of work being part of the prison estate where it can be squeezed in among the security requirement, we will have work central to prison, and change the way we build security around that work.’ A Virgin Group spokesman said: ‘We believe the more productive people can be while they are in prison, the more they can develop their skills and the better their chances of rehabilitation and of succeeding and not reoffending on release. ‘Everyone deserves a second chance and research shows that many ex-offenders are more committed and willing to do more than 'just the job' and are grateful for the opportunity to do something worthwhile.’ He said it was ‘still relatively early days across the group’, but added: ‘Sir Richard Branson believes this is the right thing to do.’ Old habits: Currently 47per cent of jailed adult offenders commit another crime within 12 months . The group's non-profit foundation Virgin Unite was ‘looking at how to increase the work opportunities in prisons, prior to and at the time of release’, the spokesman added. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ‘Firms should follow the lead set by National Grid and Timpson who not only employ former offenders in prisons but have built up a loyal and skilled workforce by doing so.’ A Marks & Spencer spokeswoman said the firm does not have a formal programme which targets ex-offenders but they can be referred to its Marks & Start scheme, which aims to support people who face barriers getting into work. Former prisoner Mark Leech, editor of the prisoners' newspaper Converse, said Mr Clarke's rhetoric ‘isn't enough’. ‘Simply telling employers to hire ex-offenders won't surmount their ingrained reluctance to do so - if Clarke is serious about this, he needs to provide incentives to employers, such as reduced employer's national insurance contributions for ex-offenders, to encourage the hiring of them,’ he said. ‘To me, it seems Clarke just doesn't get it, he doesn't understand that in order to translate theory into practice, rhetoric isn't enough - ex-offenders have paid the price for what they did, and employers should be encouraged to employ them with practical employment benefits.’ Timpson said any prisoners it employed who were eligible for paid work earned the national minimum wage, currently £6.08 per hour for those aged 21 and over, with bonuses if they achieve a particular skill level. Inmates who were not eligible for paid work receive the weekly prison wage. The average rate of pay for inmates working inside prisons was £9.60 per week in 2007, figures in the Prison Reform Trust's latest Bromley Briefings factfile showed. It added that in 2007/08 prisoners spent an average of 12.6 hours a week working.","Scheme aims to cut re-offending rate which currently sees nearly half of adult prisoners commit another crime within a year of release .

"By . Vanessa Allen and Colin Fernandez . UPDATED: . 05:59 EST, 29 November 2011 . Charlotte Church waived a £100,000 fee to sing at Rupert Murdoch’s wedding in return for favourable coverage in his newspapers, she claimed yesterday. However, the singer says she was betrayed by the media tycoon, whose publications she claims have attacked her throughout her career. Miss Church, 25, said she was persuaded by her media advisers to waive the fee to perform at Mr Murdoch’s wedding to Wendi Deng in 1999. Testimony: Charlotte Church today described how she was hounded by the Press throughout her teenage years . Deal: The singer waived a £100,000 fee in exchange for good publicity from Rupert Murdoch's newspapers . In an illustration of her childhood . innocence – she was just 13 at the time – she said she had wanted to . take the £100,000 and spend it on Tamagotchi toys, the digital pets . which were a craze at the time. In her witness statement to the . Leveson Inquiry into press standards, she said: ‘Despite my teenage . business head screaming, 'Think how many Tamagotchies you could buy!!' Mr Murdoch with Wendi Deng on their wedding day. He reportedly offered Miss Church good coverage in his papers if she gave up a £100,000 charge to sing at the reception . 'I was pressured into taking the . latter option. 'This strategy failed... for me. In fact Mr Murdoch’s . newspapers have since been some of the worst offenders, so much so that I . have sometimes felt that there has actually been a deliberate agenda.’ The inquiry heard that Mr Murdoch’s . company News International denied there had been any such deal, and that . Miss Church was booked as a surprise performer, without the tycoon’s . knowledge. But she replied that Mr Murdoch had personally insisted she should sing Pie Jesu, despite her pointing out it was a funeral requiem – and said she flew to New York on his private jet for the wedding. Miss Church told the inquiry that her childhood fame made her a ‘bankable commodity’ and exposed her to appalling psychological pressures. She said her overnight success as the ‘Voice of an Angel’ when she was just 11 had warped her childhood and meant she was hunted by paparazzi for years, with newspapers determined to portray her as a ‘fallen angel’. The former child star was catapulted to fame after she performed Pie Jesu on a television gameshow in 1997. Witness: Ms Church leaving the inquiry with her legal team . She said her fame exposed her to illegal phone hacking, blackmail attempts and kidnap plots. It left her unable to enjoy normal . relationships as a teenager, she said, and her first two serious . boyfriends both sold intimate stories about her. At 15, a tabloid newspaper ran a . ‘predatory’ clock on its website, she said, counting down the days to . her 16th birthday when she would reach the legal age for sex. Intrusion: Anne Diamond spoke at the Leveson Inquiry about the funeral of her baby son where a photographer took pictures that then appeared on the front page of The Sun . Miss Church told the inquiry her . family had suffered because of her fame and suggested that press . intrusion had contributed to her mother’s suicide attempt. Maria Church tried to kill herself in . 2005 after she discovered the News of the World was about to publish a . story that her husband was addicted to cocaine and having an affair. Miss Church said: ‘It was totally . sensationalised. Whether partially or wholly true, I just really hated . the fact that my parents, who had never been in this industry apart from . in taking care of me, were being exposed and vilified in this fashion.’ Her career was damaged by some of the negative coverage, she said, including a Sunday Times article which claimed she had denigrated the work of New York firefighters after the September 11 atrocity. Miss Church insisted she was misquoted and that her record company was forced to hire guards to protect her in the U.S. as a result. The singer accepted she had received positive publicity at the start of her career and that she had sold interviews and photo-shoots to magazines including Hello! and OK! But she claimed the deals were her attempt to decrease the demand for paparazzi pictures of her and her two children from her relationship with her former fiancé, Welsh rugby international Gavin Henson. The former TV-am presenter also claimed The Sun had infiltrated the hospital where she was giving birth by impersonating a doctor . The inquiry also heard from TV . presenter Anne Diamond, who claimed she was the victim of a 20-year . vendetta by the Murdoch empire. She suggested the tycoon had taken . revenge against her after she interviewed him in the 1980s and . ‘precociously’ told him his newspapers ‘seemed to be intent on ruining . some people’s lives’. The former TV-am presenter claimed The Sun had infiltrated the hospital where she was giving birth by impersonating a doctor. Miss Diamond said the paper also . published a front-page picture of her and her then husband carrying the . coffin of their baby son Sebastian at his funeral in 1991, after his cot . death. Christopher Jefferies, 66, told the inquiry he was ¿shamelessly vilified¿ and had to change his appearance and live 'a hole and corner' existence after police arrested him on suspicion of her murder . The landlord of murdered Joanna Yeates told yesterday how he was the victim of a ‘frenzied’ newspaper campaign to convince the public of his guilt. Christopher Jefferies, 66, said he was ‘shamelessly vilified’ and had to change his appearance and live ‘a hole and corner’ existence after police arrested him on suspicion of her murder. He told the Leveson Inquiry that his normal life was suspended as he moved from one safe-house to another until police stopped proceedings against him in March this year. Vincent Tabak, 33, was eventually arrested and convicted of the murder of the 25-year-old, who went missing on December 17 and was found dead on Christmas Day. Mr Jefferies told the inquiry: ‘The Press set about what can only be described as a witch-hunt. ‘The tabloid Press decided that I was guilty of Miss Yeates’s murder and seemed determined to persuade the public of my guilt. ‘They embarked on a frenzied  campaign to blacken my character by publishing a series of very serious allegations about me which were completely untrue, allegations which were a mixture of smear, innuendo and complete fiction.’ Mr Jefferies was released on police bail until January 1, 2011 – but his friends and lawyers advised him not to go out and not to read newspaper articles about him for his ‘psychological health’. Eight national newspapers made public apologies to Mr Jefferies in July for libellous allegations made against him. The titles – The Sun, Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, Daily Record, Daily Mail, Daily Star, The Scotsman and Daily Express – have also agreed to pay him substantial libel damages, thought to total six figures.","Singer waived £100,000 offer of fee to sing at Murdoch's wedding in return for good publicity in his newspapers .

Shocked residents quickly gathered up the discs in a bid to stop children from seeing them as they walked to a nearby school. But many had already been shattered as early morning traffic drove over them, in Pinkneys Road, Maidenhead, Berkshire. Information security expert Graham Mann, 58, said he was baffled as to why they were left outside the home he shares with wife Sue. He said: 'My neighbour came over and told me a large number of 'dubious' DVDs called 'Big Knockers' had been left outside my house. 'They were all rated 18, so it was clear they were not going to contain photographs of door furniture. 'We scooped them all up and handed them over to the police but I think some passers-by had already taken a copy for their private collection. Shocked residents quickly gathered up the discs in a bid to stop children from seeing them as they walked to a nearby school . 'My wife put one of the discs into our DVD player and informs me it is a film about three women with rather large breasts. 'The other DVD, called Mucky's Dipstick, had a chap with his trousers down who was clearly ready to get it on with a young woman. 'Sue didn't get past the title screen on either disc and I haven't seen any of them. 'We are not easily shocked but I'm sure some people would find them quite filthy. 'It's a well-to-do, respectable area with elderly residents who would be appalled by the contents.' Sue, 51, was worried they might be picked up by children as they walked past the house to school. She said: 'We've had a bit of a giggle over it. It's kind of funny but serious at the same time.' The discs stopped traffic at times as drivers, who were oblivious to their nature, tried to avoid running them over. Sue said she did not recognise the three ladies in the footage. Around 100 copies of the 18-rated film, called Big Knockers, were dumped in Pinkneys Road in Maidenhead and were spread along the verge and pavement . It is presumed the other Big Knockers discs feature the same content although they have not all been viewed. It is not known where the discs came from or why they were dropped on the street. Thames Valley Police spokesman Chris Kearney said: 'They are not the sort of discs we want lying around on the street. 'We collected them from the road where they were dumped but nobody has come forward to claim them so they will be destroyed.

Thousands of homes were still without power last night after gales and Arctic blizzards lashed northern Britain early yesterday. Motorists were left stranded on roads in some areas where eight inches of snow fell overnight, drifting to 4ft in places. Severe weather warnings were issued for parts of Scotland, Wales, northern England and the Midlands, where temperatures have plunged by as much as 20c in the last week. Flaky weather: Stuart Corner was forced to dig his car out of four feet of snow in Copley, County Durham, yesterday after blizzards swept across northern England after a heatwave .

Seven crew members had to be dramatically rescued as 70mph winds and 17ft swells wrecked a cargo ship off the coast of north Wales, while there were reports of 40mph gusts felling trees and walls in Staffordshire and Shropshire. Hundreds of lambs also perished on the North York Moors after farmers were caught out by the storms. But while much of the North shivered in freezing conditions, there was very much a North-South weather divide. Tourists in the South were sunbathing and splashing around in the sea in milder temperatures of 12c (53.6f) in Bognor Regis and Brighton. Forecasters said anyone planning an Easter getaway in the UK need not be too disheartened because the freezing weather will not last. They said temperatures will begin to creep up today, giving way to dry and bright conditions for the weekend. Around 100,000 homes lost power following the bad weather, with engineers working to restore electricity to those in Scotland, Yorkshire, the North East, Derbyshire and the Peak District. Last night supplies had been re-established to most homes, although around 12,000 were still without electricity in Yorkshire and the North East.

It ain't half still hot on the south coast: At Bognor Regis, two friends from Buckinghamshire were even brave enough to take a dip in the sea . Scotland and northern England, especially around the Pennines, North Yorkshire and Cumbria, were the worst hit by the snow falls, although snow showers were reported as far south as Devon. Around eight inches fell near Durham early yesterday, which, coupled with strong gales, caused drifts of up to 4ft in places, bringing treacherous conditions to roads. As many as 40 vehicles were stranded between Tow Law and Castleside, while ten lorries were stranded following a blizzard on the M62 at Huddersfield. In Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, two-year-old Charlotte Robertson was forced to swap her T-shirt and skirt for a snow suit as the village – which last week enjoyed the hottest March temperature in Scottish history – saw temperatures drop from 23.6c (75f) to just 2c (36f). Angela Hodgson, who runs the Marfit Head Farm camp site, between Pickering and Whitby, in North Yorkshire, said visitors were shocked when they woke to 3ft of snow. ‘There are people camping and it’s 3ft deep,’ she said. ‘We were in our T-shirts and shorts last week having a barbecue, now look at this. They just want to get out and go home.’ A spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union said hundreds of lambs had been lost and farmers were struggling without power. ‘It’s come at the worst possible time,’ he said. ‘Lambing was going very well and some farmers may have been lulled into a false sense of security by last week’s warm weather and left their lambs out. ‘Loss of power supplies is very serious for farmers who need to clean their dairy equipment and heat sheds and lamps for livestock.’ The freezing conditions moved gradually south yesterday, bringing snow falls of up to four inches on high ground in Wales and sleet showers to parts of the Cotswolds, Salisbury plain and the South West. London and the South East escaped much of the bad weather and temperatures will return to normal for April today, with highs of 11c (52f) in the South, and 10c (50f) in the North. Good Friday will be mostly dry, although there could be the odd shower in northern parts, while Saturday is likely to be dry and cloudy everywhere. Charles Powell, forecaster for the Met Office, said temperatures would be ‘recovering’ today and tomorrow to those expected for this time of year. ‘Temperatures we experienced last week were extremely mild, well above average, whereas those over the past couple of days have been at the other extreme,’ he said.","Motorists left stranded on roads in some areas where eight inches of snow fell overnight .

BMI underestimates how fat a person is in nearly half of cases . The obesity epidemic could be far worse than previously realised because of serious flaws in the  way body fat is measured, according to a study. Researchers said the Body Mass Index – the formula usually used to determine fat – drastically underestimated how many people should regard themselves as unhealthily overweight or obese. More than a third of adults in the  U.S. are considered obese. But the New York study concluded that 39 per cent of Americans were being classified as overweight on the basis of their BMI when they were actually obese. The study’s authors, Dr Eric Braverman, of Weill Cornell Medical School, and Dr Nirav Shah, the New York state health commissioner, calculated the BMI – weight in kg divided by height in metres squared – of nearly 1,400 adult patients at a private health clinic. They then compared the results with those of a more sophisticated measurement, a blood test combined with a Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan, which measures a person’s body fat, muscle mass and bone density. The comparison found BMI wrongly classified half of the women, and one in four men. While only 26 per cent of the patients were classed as obese according to BMI, 65 per cent of them fell into that category when measured with the DXA scan. Dr Braverman said BMI should be called the ‘baloney mass index’ because it was so inaccurate. The most widely used way to measure an adult's weight is to calculate body mass index (BMI). This is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared. If your BMI is between 25 and 29.9, you are over the ideal weight for your height (overweight). If your BMI is between 30 and 39.9, you are obese. If your BMI is over 40, you are very obese (known as ‘morbidly obese’). However, this method can't take into account if you are muscular. ‘The Body Mass Index is an insensitive measure of obesity, prone to under-diagnosis,’ he said. The study found BMI was especially prone to underestimating obesity in women. In addition, the likelihood of error increased as they got older. Fifty-nine per cent more women  aged 70 or over were classified as obese when measured with a DXA scan than their BMI suggested. Researchers said this was because women lost more muscle to fat than men as they age. As BMI does not distinguish between muscle and fat, it doesn’t pick up on the change. ‘BMI does not tell you how much fat you have,’ Dr Braverman added. n DEATHS from womb cancer have increased by 20 per cent over the past decade, driven by rising obesity, experts warn. The death rate in the UK from womb cancer has risen from 3.1 to 3.7 per 100,000 since the mid-1990s. This means more than 1,900 women are . dying from the disease each year, compared with fewer than 1,500 at the . turn of the millennium, the charity Cancer Research UK said. Reporting in the open access journal PLoS ONE researchers recognised that BMI was a convenient, low cost and safe way of calculating a person's weight. It is the most widely used way to measure weight in the U.S and UK. However, the authors said the outdated mathematical equation needed to evolve to correctly evaluate body fat. 'These estimates are fundamental to U.S. policy addressing the epidemic of obesity and are central to designing interventions aimed at curbing its growth,' the authors said, 'yet the [current policies] may be flawed because they are based on the BMI.' The authors said levels of leptin, a hormone protein, are strongly correlated to body fat. They suggested that if DXA was deemed to expensive that leptin levels could be used alongside BMI to create a more accurate picture of obesity.",Combining BMI with blood test to measure levels of key protein would be 'more accurate'

School leader Jon Smallwood brings a whole new meaning to the word head teacher - after performing more than 5,000 headstands around the world. The 54-year-old deputy head has been pulling off the stunts to raise money for cancer charities after battling leukaemia three years ago. He became hooked on headstands as a youngster and travels the globe performing his party trick in strange locations. Check this out! Teacher Jon Smallwood performs a headstand on a checkout at Tesco as part of his year-long fundraising campaign for cancer charities . Turning heads: Crowds watch in amazement - or bewilderment - as Mr Smallwood performs a stunt in a stream . Over the past year, he has performed a headstand on a 30ft-high rock, the Orient Express and the Leaning Tower of Pisa - where he balanced at a matching angle. The 'Headstand King', as he calls himself, has also performed the blood-rushing pose on the roof of his school, on a plane over Syria and on the checkout of a busy supermarket. Jon, who works at Bredon School in Bushley, Gloucestershire, said: 'I've always loved doing handstands and after recovering from leukaemia I decided I would put it to good use. 'I decided I would only do a headstand if it is for money, which I will donate to charity. 'Amazingly, people started daring me to pull headstands in stupid places with one person paying me £30 to do a headstand on a conveyor belt in a supermarket.' Don't look down! The 54-year-old balances on the glass floor of the 560ft Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth . Classroom act: The deputy head shows off his skills in front of his pupils at Bredon school in Gloucestershire . Jon, of Dursley, Glos, normally performs headstands for fun and often stands on his head up to 50 times a day. But he admits his 78-year-old mother told him off when he recently performed a headstand on the roof of his school. The brave teacher, who was off work for five months with leukaemia, has now raised more than £2,000 for charity.

Deryck Green, 66 blew more than £400,000 on prostitutes, stealing from the Post Office to fund his habit . A sex addict who spent more than £400,000 on prostitutes has been jailed for stealing to fund his habit. Postal clerk Deryck Green, 66, stole £28,000 from the sub post office where he worked - and which his wife managed - and spent it on prostitutes costing up to £160-an-hour. He turned to crime to fund his addiction after blowing around £305,000 from the sale of his home on hookers, and ended up another £100,000 in debt before being caught out. He covered up his misdemeanours by falsifying his accounts. Green was jailed for 17 months after being found guilty of theft and false accounting, following a week-long trial. He had attempted to kill himself by taking sleeping pills before he was sentenced leaving a suicide note titled ‘Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young’. Guilford Crown Court heard that the self-confessed sex addict, of Longbridge Deverill near Warminster, Wiltshire, helped himself to a total of £28,000 to fund his seedy lifestyle. Green turned to crime after selling his matrimonial home for £305,000 ten years ago - splashing the profits on prostitutes and then racking up another £100,000 of debts. He then stole cash from the post office section of Martins newsagents in Esher, Surrey, where his wife was manager, between December 2008 and September 2009. Susannah Bramley, prosecuting, said he resorted to making electronic cash transfers to a till that was hardly ever checked to hide his deception. She said Green stole £28,000 until his dishonesty was spotted. Ms Bramley said: 'In an attempt to hide the thefts, he falsified records on his computer. 'Unfortunately for Mr Green, the Post Office decided to do an internal audit on a day when he wasn’t working.' When interviewed by his bosses, Green offered to confess - but later threatened to 'discredit' the Post Office and Martins, by publicising a loophole in their system.

After being found guilty of theft and false accounting and released on bail, Green attempted suicide on the day he was originally supposed to be sentenced. He was found unconscious and taken to hospital suffering from a drugs overdose. Green had written a defiant 'suicide note' which dealt with his fondness for fast living and his taste for sex sessions with prostitutes, Judge Neil Stewart told the court. The judge told Green: 'Your conduct was cynical, deliberate and dishonest.' Green was brought to court in custody for sentencing after spending two weeks at Salisbury Hospital. Anthony Mitchell, defending, said: 'He had taken 190 tablets of a prescribed drug.' Mr Mitchell said Green and his wife - who had also been admitted to Salisbury Hospital following a suspected stroke - were in debt to the tune of £100,000. He told the court: 'My client had been addicted to sex and the use of prostitutes. He was spending between £100 an hour to £160 an hour on prostitutes. 'He ran out of money, which led him into the criminal offences for which he now appears before the court.' Mr Mitchell described Green’s relationship with his wife as 'slightly strained'.","Spent £300,000 from house sale on prostitutes - then ran up another £100,000 in debt .

Fall: George Townley, 72, who died after plunging 15ft off a bridge at Warwick Castle as he left after a day out . One of Britain's most famous castles has been fined £350,000 after a grandfather fell 15ft to his death from a bridge into a dry moat. George Townley, 72, was leaving Warwick Castle when he stumbled over a low parapet wall as he was leaving after a day out with his partner and her family. The pensioner died from his injuries he sustained in the fall the following day, Warwick Crown Court heard. The castle, built by William the Conqueror in 1068, did not take 'sufficient measures' to protect visitors crossing the bridge and failed to carry out an appropriate risk assessment, the judge was told. Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd, who run the castle, was found guilty of two charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act in relation to the retired mechanic's death in December 2007. Judge Nigel Godsmark QC ordered the company to pay £350,000 in fines. He said: 'This matter arose from the tragic death of George Townley. 'The death was tragic and unfortunate and he seems to have tripped unluckily. On my part I believe the risk of the bridge was not mainly to adult pedestrians but to children. 'Many people have crossed the bridge over the years and some were of the ilk of the health and safety experts from whom most of their evidence has been given in hindsight but Merlin had failed in its duty.' Barry Berlin, prosecuting, said: 'It is crystal clear that there was a material risk here and at a result of that people were put at risk. 'On anyone's account the bridge should have been risk assessed because it was a major artery to the castle. 'Warning signs could have been put up and a barrier could have been put up. 'That's not just what we suggest, that is clear from the December 10 risk assessment that was carried out the day after the accident. Sadly this was too late.' Plunge: There was a 'one in 80 million chance' of someone falling off the bridge and suffering a serious injury at Warwick Castle, the court was told . Keith Morton QC, defending, said Merlin, who took charge of Warwick Castle in 1978, accepted the parapet wall was low but pointed out there had been about 20million visitors who had crossed the bridge since the company had been involved with the castle. He said: 'There was an insignificant risk of one in four million of any type of accident happening on the bridge and a one in 40million risk of serious injury or death, you can't get much more insignificant than that other than, I suppose, one in 80million. 'It's hard to see how there was a significant risk.' Merlin . was found guilty of failing to take suitable and sufficient measures to . prevent or protect visitors when entering or leaving the castle via the . bridge from falling from a considerable height. It was also found guilty of failing in its duty to provide preventative and protective measures. Tragedy: The owners of Warwick Castle have been fined £350,000 after Mr Townley plunged off the bridge at the front of the castle (pictured) As well as a £350,000 fine, the company was also ordered to pay costs of £145,000 to Warwick District Council. Castle staff put temporary barriers on both sides of the bridge on the day after the accident, which are still in place. The company say they intend to put up permanent barriers. As well as Warwick Castle, Merlin also run famous British tourist attractions like Alton Towers, the London Eye, Madame Tussauds and Thorpe Park.","George Townley, 72, stumbled over the edge as he left after a day out .

He was the debonair black-clad hero who risked life and limb to deliver chocolates to his beloved – and all because the lady loved Milk Tray. But it seems both ladies and their would-be paramours are more likely to turn up their noses at a box of the iconic Cadbury chocolates these days amid complaints about quality and flavour. Websites and social networking forums have been inundated with concerns about the poor taste of the chocolates and claims that old favourites have been reformulated or dropped completely. Wrong selection: The new Milk Tray box has left many customers angry by the poor choice of chocolates. The orange crescent and hazelnut whirl, both circled, are at the centre of the storm . The complaints have surfaced two years after the controversial  £11 billion takeover of Cadbury by American food giant Kraft Foods. There is particular outrage about the orange truffle, a replacement for the traditional orange cream. Consumers say that the modern crescent-shaped version is a poor imitation of its rich, creamy pre-decessor with only a hint of orange flavour. The hazelnut whirl has also been the subject of vigorous debate, with many claiming it has been reformulated and its distinctive hard-edged grooves replaced with softer whirls. Meanwhile, eagle-eyed shoppers have also noticed the absence of coffee creams and mocha-flavoured chocolates, and bemoaned the loss of the paper menu from boxes, once delivered by action man Gary Myers in the iconic Seventies TV adverts. Instead, they point out that there are now four different caramel  chocolates and three separate hazel-nut sweets in a standard 7.05oz (200g) box. Iconic: Gary Myers as the black-clad hero delivering Milk Tray in the Seventies was a hit television advert . On social networking site Twitter, Zara Horner wrote on April 9:  ‘Cadbury milk tray chocolates are vile! #disappointed.’ Two . days later, fellow user Graham Fielding added: ‘Milk Tray is so cheap . these days. It doesn’t seem the luxury product it was in my youth.’ On . a specialist food review website on April 8, an anonymous man . described how he was given a box of Milk Tray as an Easter gift from his . wife. ‘I was really looking forward to the lovely creamy taste of the chocolate and the creamy flavours of the various creme centres,’ he began. Then he fumed: ‘WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! They were absolute rubbish. The chocolate was not at all smooth and left a nasty aftertaste in the mouth. The old creme fillings have either been completely eliminated, as with the orange flavour, or have been completely changed in taste. The coffee-flavoured chocs have disappeared completely. Dedication: The craggy chocolate box clutching hero jumped from . helicopters, skied over cliffs and abseiled across our screens for 26 . years . ‘I shall not be buying ANY more of these chocolates ever again.’Another . contributor commented: ‘Rubbish! They certainly weren’t like the Milk . Tray that I remember [delicious and full of flavour]. They all tasted . more or less the same, very artificial and certainly not a lot of . variety. ‘The box looks impressive but the contents leave a lot to be desired and I certainly won’t be buying them again!’ Another, who signed herself meledna, remarked on April 16 last year: ‘I can describe them in two words. BORING. BLAND.’ There are also accusations on the websites that Kraft is responsible for the changes. But Kraft insists that any changes to ingredients and production methods predate the takeover, and go back to 2007. At the time of Kraft’s hostile bid for Cadbury, there was a public outcry and more than 20,000 Mail on Sunday readers backed this newspaper’s campaign to ‘Keep Cadbury British’. There were concerns that the quality of the chocolate would suffer if operations were taken over by the US company. Buyout: Manufacturers Cadbury were taken over by American food giant Kraft Foods for £11 billion . Many worried about the loss of another historic British brand and the potential loss of jobs in the UK prompted by the takeover. When Chicago-based Kraft succeeded in its takeover early in 2010, it was criticised by MPs for reneging on a promise to keep open a factory near Bristol. The move resulted in the loss of hundreds of jobs as production moved to Poland. Kraft boss Irene Rosenfeld, dubbed the ‘Queen Of Cheese’ because of the firm’s other famous product, refused to fly to Britain to answer questions over the U-turn. Kraft has also been allowed to keep the Royal Warrant on Milk Tray boxes, an award first given to Cadbury by Queen Victoria in 1854. The decision follows detailed consideration by the Royal Warrant Holders Association. Secretary Richard Peck explained: ‘A Royal Warrant is granted to a company, and it may well be that company manufactures the product abroad – but that’s the way the market works these days. ‘In the case of Cadbury, when it was acquired by Kraft it was looked at very carefully and the situation was considered and accepted.’Kraft last night defended Milk Tray, which enjoys sales worth  £20 million in the UK every year. Tony Bilsborough, head of external communications at Kraft UK, said: ‘We have not seen any increase in complaints about Milk Tray. ‘We conduct extensive scientific consumer research and are constantly checking on people’s likes, dislikes and hates.’ Mr Bilsborough added: . ‘Orange and strawberry chocolates have changed because in 2007 we moved away from artificial colourings and we no longer use them in our products. ‘Orange oil is now used to flavour the orange chocolate and straw- berries for the strawberry one.’ He also conceded that the hazelnut whirl had changed ‘because of different machinery in the Polish factory’. He added that ‘consumers have told us they don’t like hard edges on chocolates, so there are smoother curves on the hazelnut’. Kraft said the paper menu had been discontinued as part of their commitment to reduce unnecessary packaging. Verdict by Tom Parker Bowles . Just what have they gone and done? To Milk Tray, I mean, the box of chocolates so damned sophisticated they were delivered by a superspy clad in a superfine cashmere polo neck. He skied down vertical slopes, powered speedboats over Mafia baddies and waterfalls, hung from creaking cable cars, dived from cliffs, dodged sharks and all because … the lady loved Milk Tray. OK, despite the sub Lazenby-as-Bond adverts, these were resolutely democratic chocolates. Choc choice: Tom is switching to rival Nestle's Quality Street from now instead of classic Milk Tray . Modest too, not the sort to boast about high cocoa content, or Fairtrade beans. And all the better for it – far preferable to those snooty Lindts and upwardly-mobile Milkas. I bow to no one in my love for Dairy Milk. And the joy of Milk Tray used to be lashings of the stuff, draped across over-sweet, garish pink strawberry centres and lurid orange creams. You weren’t looking for natural essences and hand-crafted pieces, but rather solid, reliable chocolate. Now, though, in their new-look box, every single piece seems to taste the same. Dull, turgid and slightly greasy. The ‘hazelnut heaven’ sees a pretty paltry nut buried in a waxy, dog-choc-like mound of chocolate mud. ‘Orange truffle’ is a sorry excuse, with only the very faintest whisper of citrus. I’m not sure what the ‘nut secret’ is hiding, but one nibble is more than enough. ‘Honey love’ might be a half-decent name for a Bond girl. In a chocolate, though, it’s debased, like chewing on beeswax lip balm. In fact, the only two that come close to the old-fashioned favourites are the ‘eastern delight’ (the chocolate formerly known as Turkish Delight.) And an OK-ish ‘caramel charm’. Even these two rays of relative light can’t escape the curse of that cheap, nasty chocolate covering. The sad truth is that these taste more like American chocolate than British. And as anyone who has ever suffered the rank indignities of Hershey’s and its ilk know only too well, this is very bad news indeed. Cadbury say the chocolates are ‘made in the EU Under Licence’. It seems the process has long departed this sceptred isle. The only really good news is that the cursed coffee one has been given the boot. But too little, too late. Farewell Milk Tray. From now on, it’s Quality Street all the way.","Concerns over quality of chocolate and claims favourites have been dropped .

A serial groper has been jailed for sexually assaulting a student during a drunken night spent trying to molest groups of women. Shane Hobbs, 26, was captured on CCTV laughing as he walked away from his shocked victim after thrusting his fist down her trousers. Cameras followed Hobbs as he staggered through Exeter city centre lunging and fondling several women enjoying a night out, the court heard. The attack on the Chinese student from Exeter University left her too frightened to go out at night, Exeter Crown Court was told. Hobbs, of Dawlish Warren, Devon, was jailed for 16 months after admitting sexual assault on one woman and common assault on a second during the incident in February, this year. Judge Phillip Wassall said the offences were so serious, only immediate custody was appropriate. He said: ‘You approached two Exeter University students, who were both Chinese, and out for a quiet night in Exeter. You got right in her face and your hand went down her back. ‘You touched her bottom and you reached inwards and put your hand into the area of her private parts. The victim says she was caused shock and a small amount of pain for five minutes. ‘This was plainly not touching in an instant and although it was over in ten seconds or so it was a very serious incident carried out quite deliberately in your drunken state. Caught: Hobbs was filmed on CCTV cameras staggering through Exeter city centre, lunging and grabbing at groups of women . He added: ‘It left her very frightened and unwilling to go out because she wondered if something like it could happen again. ‘It must have been particularly distressing because she was so far away from home and had come here from different shores. ‘It did not end there. You approached another group of girls and got one around the neck and tried to drag her to the ground. You slipped off her and allowed her to walk on. ‘I regard the sexual assault in drink against a complete stranger as being very serious. Mr Alex Allsop, prosecuting, showed the judge the CCTV footage taken at 8.30 pm at night which showed the first assault outside the Tesco Metro in Queen Street. Hobbs had already lurched at one woman and he then held out his arms to stop the victim and her friend before putting an arm around her and moving to her bottom. Sentenced: Judge Phillip Wassall jailed Hobbs to 16 months for what the 'very serious' sexual assault . The CCTV then followed him as he walked onto High Street and accosted two more women, talking to them as he walked with them and then hurling an arm around the shoulders of one of them. They both staggered for a few moments and she pulled herself away from him and hurried off while he wandered around before falling over and lying in the middle of the road. He said: ‘Hobbs was arrested and told police he could remember nothing about the assault because he had fallen out with his girlfriend and been drinking. ‘He apologised for his behaviour and said he knows he gets stupid when he has been drinking. He said he’d had at least ten pints with shots and Jager bombs.’ Mr James Taghdissian, defending, said Hobbs was so ashamed of his actions he could not watch the CCTV footage and covered his eyes when shown it by police. He said: ‘This was out of character. He does not normally act in this way. It was ten seconds of wholly inappropriate behaviour which has led him to court faced with this serious offence.’","Shane Hobbs, 26, was caught no CCTV thrusting hand down university student's trousers .

Horrific: Amber Roderick, 19, pictured, lured a 16-year-old to a house party where she was plied with drink and drugs before being gang-raped at knifepoint . A teenage girl was today jailed for luring a 16-year-old to a house party where she was plied with drink and drugs before being gang-raped at knifepoint. Amber Roderick, 19, smothered herself in dog shampoo and joined in with the horrific attack which left the vulnerable victim traumatised. Today it emerged that she had only just been released from jail after forcing two boys, aged nine and ten, to perform sex acts on each other in a park. Jailing her indefinitely for at least four years, Judge Bruce McIntyre said she posed a significant risk of harm to the public, including young people and children. Roderick had met the 16-year-old in the street and later persuaded her to join a party which was being thrown by her friends. She was given cannabis as well as vodka and coke drinks so strong she had to ask for them to be watered down, Reading Crown Court heard. The initial assault took place on the top floor of the house, in Reading,  where Joseph Lawrence, 29, threatened the girl with a knife before forcing himself on her. Roderick also took part in the attack. After the pair had finished, Lawrence told his young victim that he would stab her in the face if she ever told anyone. But her horrific ordeal was not over. She managed to free herself and tried to flee to the bathroom. But she was caught by 26-year-old Patrick Maughan, another party-goer, and Roderick, who subjected her to another assault. It was at this point that Roderick rubbed dog shampoo over her own body as she carried out the attack. The horrifying act lasted less than 10 . seconds but the victim told Reading Crown Court it . left her feeling physically sick and shattered. She eventually managed to escape from the house and informed police. Her attackers were arrested while they were still drunk at the party, which was held at Lawrence's mother's house on April 3 last year. The court heard how even in police cells Roderick was heard threatening to kill her victim. Roderick refused to appear before Judge McIntyre to be sentenced today and stayed in the cells beneath the court room. In her absence, she was jailed indefinitely with a minimum term of four years. Jailed: Joseph Lawrence, left, threatened the terrified girl with a knife before raping her. Patrick Maughan, right, also sexually assaulted the youngster . Judge McIntyre said that Roderick posed a 'significant risk of serious harm to the public, including . children and young persons and that is likely to remain the position . until she addresses her offending behaviour.' And he revealed that she had been found guilty of 'similar bullying sexual abuse before'. 'Ms Roderick has chosen not to tell anybody who might have told me what . has happened in her short life to make her the way she is,' he said. 'However, . in Ms Roderick’s case I am quite satisfied that as a result of these . offences and her previous convictions for sexual abuse of young boys, . taken together with her attitude to anybody who challenges her about . this offending behaviour, that she is dangerous. Addressing Lawrence, he said: 'It was a prolonged period of time during which she was kept in that house. 'You . did not use a condom. You threatened her afterwards using words to the . effect that she might get stabbed in the face if she told anybody what . had happened. You showed no remorse.' Maughan was jailed for six years while Lawrence, from Reading, was given seven years. The pair smiled and waved at weeping family members as they were led down to the cells. Maughan kissed his partner through the glass around the dock as she wailed 'Patrick' before he was taken down. All three had been found guilty after a trial in December. The verdicts sparked violent scenes in court in which Roderick attacked security guards. The mother of one of Amber Roderick's previous victims had warned that the teenager would attack again. Roderick abused two boys, aged nine . and ten, in Cardiff in 2008 and relatives of the younger victim sat . in the public gallery during today's  sentencing at Reading Crown Court. Outside court the boy’s . mother told how she had warned probation after the original assault . that she believed the sexual predator would attack again. The . boy’s mother said: 'We are just so happy that she got what she deserved - . I think it’s closure for us but I did think perhaps she would do it . again. 'It’s been bad. We haven’t been too well over the last couple . of months now, with it all coming back. I did say to probation it would . happen again. 'My son is not good. He hasn’t coped with what . happened. He still does get worried and he doesn’t go out really because . he’s afraid.' The . distraught mother-of-three recalled how Roderick had led a gang of two . other girls, both 12 at the time, bullying the young boys in the park . before kidnapping them. The youngsters were taken to a wooded area . where they were beaten, her son had a stick forced down his throat and . they were then made to perform oral sex on each other. Roderick, aged . 15 at the time, was sent to a young offenders’ institute for two years . after the attack, despite falling pregnant in the months that followed. The . boy’s mother even mounted a campaign to stop Roderick being released early . and moving back to Tremorfa, in Cardiff, where the attack took place. Her calls were successful when the youth was released only after serving the two-year term and did not move back to the area. Roderick committed the latest offence shortly after being released.","Terrified youngster was subjected to series of horrifying attacks inside house .

Two Romanian gypsies face jail after smuggling a child dubbed 'Cinderella' into the UK and forcing her to work as a servant. The seven-year-old girl was sent to Britain by her penniless mother in the hope of a better life. But in the UK she was beaten, humiliated, and forced to sleep on the floor while carrying out domestic duties. Aurel Zlate, 46, and his wife Alexandra Oaie, 43, beat . her 'like a carpet' and the abuse was so bad that when she was rescued . by police she was dressed in filthy clothes, had scabs all over her head . and her teeth were so rotten they had to be removed. Husband and wife Aurel Zlatea, 45, and Alexandra Oaie, 44, were responsible for trafficking a seven year old Romanian girl into the country where she was beaten and used as domestic servant . Her treatment at the hands of her 'carers' led to her being dubbed Cinderella, after the abused girl in the fairy-tale. The little girl, who was stolen from her mother after her tormentors lied that she would get a better life, told police officers she 'hated' her female captor, adding: 'I can't stand her because she beats me all the time. 'She was always saying work, work, I was getting dirty, my hands and feet were getting dirty. 'I would tidy up and I would do all the rooms and they wouldn't do anything.' A child psychologist who assessed the child when she was eventually taken into care found she couldn't count to ten in her own language and was unable to express even basic emotions. The pair sobbed in the dock at Croydon Crown Court as the guilty verdicts were read out . And it emerged that her tormentors' children had also sexually abused another man who was trafficked over to the UK. Romanians Zlate and Oaie, who is known by the nickname Ferma, were found guilty of trafficking the youngster in October 2010 with the intention of exploiting her. They will be sentenced later today. The pair, who have eight children of their own and are on benefits, were also convicted of neglecting and ill-treating her while she was in their care. The jury were told the family had a . string of convictions for offences including shoplifting, going equipped . to steal, attempted theft and common assault, dating back to 2003. The . court heard that a 53-year-old man was also forced to come to . the UK, where he was sexually assaulted and forced to work for no pay. He . was locked in a shed by the couples' two sons, raped, beaten and forced . to work as a driver and steal scrap metal for his captors. Unable . to speak English, the man, who cannot be named, fled the home in Wood . Green, north London, to a police station in March last year. He let officers know he was in trouble by scrawling SOS on a scrap of paper. The couple and their son Marian Neamu, 25, were convicted of bringing him to the UK with the intention of exploiting him. Neamu . and his brother Florin Zlate, 23, were also found guilty of raping him . as he dared to ask for food during a New Year's Eve party. Neamu . was convicted of one count of trafficking, one count of ABH, one count . of assault by penetration, one count of rape and one count of false . imprisonment. Florin Zlate was convicted of one . count of ABH, one count of assault by penetration, one count of rape and . one count of false imprisonment. The sex charges relate to the 53-year-old man. The pair, who ran an illegal scrap metal business from their three-bedroom terraced house in Wood Green while claiming thousands of pounds of benefits, were also found guilty of trafficking a 53-year-old man to the UK from Romania. Both sobbed in the dock at Croydon Crown Court as the guilty verdicts were read out. The maximum sentence for trafficking is 14 years. The sickening story only came to the attention of police authorities after a 53-year-old man - who was also trafficked and sexually abused by the family - escaped from their clutches and alerted police. Himself beaten and mistreated, the man was so alarmed about the youngster's living conditions he named her Censusreasa, the Romanian name for Cinderella. He told the jury: 'Ferma treated her badly. She hit her, and made her do things a girl of six or seven should not have to do. 'Sweeping the floor, carrying debris on the building site, she was like a little slave looking after the youngest children. 'She was changing nappies, feeding them and making up their bottles and feeding the animals. 'She would be hit on the head and shouted at and sworn at. The other children would beat her like she was a carpet. 'She was just like Cinderella, she was never allowed to do a day of school.' When police went to the home they found the girl and put her in emergency care. Zlatea claimed he was the father, handing over a fake birth certificate and a court order giving him custody. But a DNA test proved neither were the parents, and when police visited Romania they found the true mum - a cleaner working for the Zlatae family. She said she had been approached by Oaie who wanted to adopt the child as she believed she could give her a better life and helped provide the fake documentation. But in his evidence the male victim, who had worked as an electrician in Romania until he fell on hard times, described how her life was miserable from the moment she was taken from her mother. He said that the little girl sat 'like a frightened animal' in the back of a van as she was brought to Britain. She even vomited on herself during the journey to the UK but was too scared to make a sound. The court heard Oaie was the 'boss' of the house, where 16 people including her own eight children lived and claimed benefits, while running a scrap metal business from the back garden.","Child beaten and humiliated by Aurel Zlate, 46, and his wife Alexandra Oaie, 43 .

Desperate blinded PC David Rathband told his estranged wife she would 'look nice in black' in a cry for help phone call just an hour before he killed himself. The morbid conversation sparked frantic text chat between his widow Kath and his sister Debbie who both became frightened he was about to commit suicide in his Northumberland home, it was revealed today. On February 29, the day he died, Mrs Rathband visited her husband, who had been in bed for three days, not eating and taking too much medication. She asked his sister to visit and pick him up because Rathband had just thrown her out of his house and Kath was worried he was suicidal, according to a series of texts in The Sun. Their last picture together: David Rathband and his wife Kath celebrate Christmas at home last year but later separated. It has now been revealed that Rathband called her on the day he died and said she'd look 'nice in black' But Debbie, who had tried to contact him for days, was unable to get to his home in Blyth, and urged his wife to contact the authorities to get him sectioned and prevent him taking his own life. At 17.57pm Rathband then called his wife of 20 years in one final cry for help. They had allegedly split after she believed he had an affair with 7/7 attack survivor Lisa French. 'He just phoned me one minute ago and told me I will look nice in black. I have told him I will help him but he won't let me,' Mrs Rathband said in a text to his sister. 'I have left a message for his welfare officer to call me. If David won't answer the door they can break in,' she told Debbie 30 minutes later. Emotional: PC David Rathband's twin Darren and sister Debbie just after his death. Debbie was involved in a frantic text conversation with her brother's wife Kath in the hours before his death . Happier times: David and Kath Rathband with their children Ashley and Mia in 2006 before he was blinded . Debbie replied: 'Thanks God Kath. I know we haven't always seen eye to eye but we have one thing in common and I hope that's our love for David.' Gunman: Fugitive Raoul Moat shot PC Rathband in the face while he was sat in his patrol car in July 2010 an act that eventually led to his death . But tragically just 25 minutes later PC Rathband's body was discovered in his home. He hanged himself 20 months after being blinded by gunman Raoul Moat, . who shot him twice at point-blank range as he sat in his parked traffic . car in Newcastle upon Tyne. Moat, 37, had already shot his former girlfriend, Samantha Stobbart, 23, . and murdered her new partner, 29-year-old karate instructor Chris . Brown. After seven days on the run he was cornered in the Northumberland . village of Rothbury and at the end of a six-hour stand-off with police . he shot himself in the head. Rathband's poignant funeral was overshadowed by a bitter feud that has engulfed and divided his family. His twin brother Darren, 44, used a nine-minute eulogy at the end of the emotional ceremony to launch a barely-veiled attack on Kath. Relations between Darren and Mrs Rathband had deteriorated since she and PC Rathband separated last year, and Darren warned that she was not welcome at the funeral and that it was his brother’s wish that she did not attend. She defied those wishes for the sake of the couple’s children Ashley, 19, and Mia, 13, arriving 45 minutes early for the 12pm service at Stafford Crematorium, long before the arrival of the funeral cortège. Later, as he addressed the 200 mourners, . Darren – who is also a policeman – said: ‘There have been times when . our lives have run in parallel, separated by  distance, and at times by . others who strove to break a unique bond. I say to those who tried in . life and now in his death, you have failed. Feud: David Rathband's twin Darren, pictured left, warned that his brother's wife Kath, right, would not be welcome at his funeral but she came anyway . ‘I hope that those who carry a burden after his death carry it within themselves and not aim to lay that at his graveside. ‘It is just as cowardly to judge an absent person as it is wicked to strike a defenceless one. ‘I just hope the memory of my brother, and Ash and Mia’s father, is not tarnished by others who feel the need to set the record straight.' Kath Rathband said yesterday that David Rathband had a string of affairs during their two-decade marriage. In an interview with a Sunday newspaper, she claimed this started when she was pregnant with their 19-year-old son Ashley but she always took him back after he was unfaithful. ‘I always loved him, but I knew emotionally that he was weak,’ she told the Sunday Mirror. ‘He also really loved me and the kids. I couldn’t imagine living without him. And I know he would have made life incredibly difficult if he left. ‘He’d say “I’m always going to be there, you know that? I’ll never leave you alone”. I would put up with things to keep it on an even keel.’","The phone call happened at around 5.57pm and his body was found at 7pm .

Sky News yesterday admitted hacking into the email account of back-from-the-dead canoeist John Darwin. The news channel said it authorised one of its reporters to intercept messages before Darwin was jailed in 2008 for faking his death in an elaborate plot to secure £500,000 in pension and life insurance payouts. The broadcaster said yesterday that it stood by its actions and insisted that its North of England reporter, Gerard Tubb, was acting in the public interest. Revelation: Sky News has admitted that it twice authorised journalists to hack phones while they were researching stories they believed to be in the public interest . Sky News is part of BSkyB, which is . 39 per cent owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. Mr Murdoch’s . media empire has been in the spotlight over claims of phone hacking by . journalists at some of his British newspapers. Mr Tubb was authorised by a senior . executive at Sky News to access Darwin’s Yahoo! email account before his . wife, Anne, went on trial for her part in the scam. Darwin, of Seaton . Carew, near Hartlepool, had already pleaded guilty to deception before . her trial. Canoe couple: Anne and John Darwin were the target of one of Sky News's hacks . The information Mr Tubb gathered was . handed to Cleveland Police and used in the successful prosecution of Mrs . Darwin in July 2008. The emails cast doubt on her defence that she had . been forced to go along with the plot by her ‘domineering’ husband. Mr . Tubb had accessed Darwin’s email account in the name John Jones after . discovering that Darwin had used a false identity after faking his . death. Intercepting emails is a prima facie . breach of the Computer Misuse Act, to which there is no public interest . defence written in law. Headache for Murdoch: The tycoon's Sky News channel has admitted authorising reporters to hack emails . But any prosecution would be at the discretion . of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. John Ryley, head of Sky News, said: . ‘We stand by these actions as editorially justified and in the public . interest.’ He added: ‘The police made clear after the trial that this . information was pivotal to the case.’ Cleveland Police, which led the . investigation into the Darwins, said inquiries were ongoing into how Sky . News obtained the emails. In a separate case, Mr Tubb was authorised to access the emails of a suspected paedophile and his wife. Both instances of hacking were . approved by Simon Cole, Sky News’s managing editor. Yesterday Sky News . said he was retiring after 17 years and that his retirement was entirely . unrelated to the revelations. Mr Cole wrote on Twitter: ‘I’ve been . planning for some time to retire from Sky News. This is unrelated to the . Darwin story. There is no linkage.

Miss Aylward eventually realises something is wrong and calls for the care assistant on duty, who asks: 'What have you done?', before calling 999 . The then . 37-year-old had been so worried about the care he was receiving he set . up a camera at his home in Devizes, Wiltshire, following previous . problems with his ventilator. But just days into looking . after him Aylward, a learning disabilities nurse without proper medical . training, was caught on film turning off the machine. Footage . from the camera, which he had put in to guard against poor care, shows . her grabbing the resuscitation machine and shouting, ‘What do I do with . this?’ before paramedics were called to save him. Mr Merrett, who requires 24-hour . care, was left permanently brain damaged after his brain was starved off . oxygen for up to 21 minutes. Violeta . Aylward is a Filipino learning disabilities nurse who had not worked in . intensive care and was not trained to manage a ventilated patient. Mr Merrett who suffered severe brain damage, was shown in a BBC documentary struggling to say his name - his sister Karren Reynolds right, attended the misconduct hearing today . Although Mr Merritt was paralysed from the neck down and dependent on a ventilator, he could operate a wheelchair and remained mentally alert, using a voice-activated computer to manage his own affairs and study languages. He had warned NHS Wiltshire, which funded his care, that staff twice previously failed to connect his ventilator properly. When he had the camera installed in . January 2009, Mr Merrett needed 24-hour care from nurses trained to look . after a ventilated patient with intensive care experience. A notice stuck beneath the camera read: ‘This is my webcam. It is for my family to see that I am safe. It is recording.’ Footage . shows Miss Aylward approach the ventilator and push a button once which . starts an alarm beeping and a red light flashing. Mistreated: Jamie Merrett with his sister, Karren Reynolds (centre), and her daughter, Lauren . She then pushes the button again, switching off the machine and cutting off the oxygen supply. Mr Merrett, who cannot speak as he is starved of air, clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth – a warning sound ventilated patients are told to make in an emergency. Miss Aylward eventually realises something is wrong and calls for the care assistant on duty, who asks: ‘What have you done?’, before calling 999. Miss Aylward is seen floundering with the resuscitation equipment. Instead of connecting it to the hole in Mr Merrett’s neck she puts it in his mouth. She calls out: ‘How do you do this?’ She then urges her patient: ‘Jamie breathe please.’ Paramedics restarted the machine after 21 minutes but by then Mr Merrett suffered severe brain damage. Aylward, of Reading, now faces being struck off the nursing register after being charged with failing to provide adequate care to Mr Merrett and working when she was not competent to do so. Wiltshire Primary Care Trust were responsible for commissioning Mr Merrett’s care but had to subcontract it out to nursing agencies due to a lack of staff. Neil Moloney, for the Nursing and Midwifery Council, said Aylward was employed by Ambition 24 Hours Nursing Agency to provide care to Mr Merrett. Her first shift was on December 23 2008 during which she raised no concerns. She worked three further shifts over the Christmas and New Year period with no problems. But it was during a night shift on January 8 2009 that Aylward turned off Mr Merrett’s ventilator after checking its settings. Mr Moloney said: 'At approximately 8.15pm an incident occurred where the registrant switched off Patient A’s ventilator. 'On two previous occasions Patient A had experience significant failings with the nursing care of his ventilator and was very anxious about the re-occurrence of such an incident so therefore installed CCTV in his room. 'The CCTV footage was reviewed following the incident. At around 8.05pm the registrant went into Patient A’s room to undertake observations. 'She left the room and returned shortly afterwards to check the ventilator settings. 'She is seen to push several buttons and after a few moments a red light appeared and the alarm was activated. 'The registrant continues to push buttons in an attempt to turn it back on and calls to care assistant Mercedes Creed in to the room for assistance.” Care assistant Miss Creed then told Aylward to start resuscitation using an Ambubag while she went to call 999. The footage shows Aylward attempt to do mouth-to-mouth on the patient despite the fact the Ambubag should be used on his tracheotomy. Within minutes a paramedic from a first response team arrived and took over and two further paramedics in an ambulance followed. Mr Merrett rushed to Salisbury Hospital Intensive Care Unit but by that point he had already suffered permanent brain damage. Mr Moloney said Aylward was employed to look after Mr Merrett despite not having the proper training to do so. 'The agency were aware of the requirements that the nurse must have Intensive Care Unit training or experience. 'The registrant was on the books as a registered learning disabilities nurse, not a register general nurse. She did not have ITU training or experience. An investigation by Wilshire County Council, who run the local Primary Care Trust, and the police followed but it was decided there was insufficient evidence to pursue a charge of Grievous Bodily Harm. Aylward, who is not attending the hearing due to ill health, faces being struck off it a fitness to practise panel find her guilty of misconduct.

A stair climbing champion who achieved a record-breaking time had a winning technique up his sleeve - taking the elevator. Miguel Larios, 31, won the tough climb up the 62 storys of the Aon Center in downtown Los Angeles in an impressive seven minutes and 45 seconds. Larios, who worked at the skyscraper, had entered in the 5th Fight For Air Climb which raises funds for the American Lung Association. Grueling: Stair-climbing (pictured here at a tower in Tel Aviv) is a hardy sport - made significantly easier if you hop on an elevator like one competitor in California . Organisers were furious when after looking into the 31-year-old's amazing time - a course record - CCTV footage showed him jumping into an elevator. Although Larios said that he didn't cheat, he admitted that there was footage of him taking the elevator at the race on March 31. He explained that his advantage came from having worked in the Center for ten years. No mean feat: Racers climbed the 62-story Aon Tower in downtown Los Angeles to raise money for the American Lung Association . His punishment was severe - not only did Larios lose his crown as course champion, he was also sacked from his job as a maintenance man. Mark Trahanovsky, a 53-year-old stair-climber from  Yorba Linda, said: 'We looked at this person’s body and his physique, and we knew (he did) not have the physique of an elite stair-climber. 'He wasn’t sweating a lot; he wasn’t tired. He was wearing basketball shoes.' Mr Trahanovsky added: 'It's like a swimmer using fins.' Some 750 participants took part in this year's  Fight For Air Climb - but the majority focus on the charity aspect rather than being competitive. The American Lung Assocation raised funds to fight lung disease and asthma along with promoting good health. An association spokesman Bo Smith said little about Larios' cheating scandal, only commenting: 'There was no way to validate the time... He could have flown upwards.' The next fundraising event is a swim in Santa Monica Bay in August. He did not have the physique of an elite stair-climber... It's like a swimmer using fins. Mark Trahanovsky, fellow competitor . Stair climbing is widely acknowledged as one of the most grueling sports around and reportedly burns twice as many calories as other activities. Some of the biggest events include the run up the 1,576 steps of the Empire State Building in New York every February.

Neatly trimmed lawns and fixed picket fences could soon be the order of the day for not only homeowners in New York, but across America, if they want to avoid hefty fines and even jail time. This week, a unanimous vote was passed outlawing messy gardens, excessive litter, graffiti and broken windows in Massapequa Park, Long Island. Home and business owners face fines of $10,000 (£6,343) and up to 15 days in jail for flouting the law. Clean cut: This homeowner in Massapequa Park could now face fines of up to $10,000 for not properly maintaining their lawn . The measure was brought in to stop the community's property prices sinking further and force landowners, including banks, from letting empty properties fall into disrepair following a foreclosure. Now James Altadonna, mayor of Massapequa Park, said a “number of other municipalities” — including . the nearby town of Brookhaven — are considering passing a similar law. He told Fox News: 'It was really out of frustration in trying to get banks to maintain . [foreclosed] properties, so we wanted to craft a law that would be . significant enough to get the attention of the banks. 'We’re willing to work with anyone who will respond to us . and maintain their property. These fines are only for the most . egregious.' Get to work: Incomplete building work, litter, graffiti and broken windows could all lead to breaches of the new law . Alongside Massapequa Park, similar measures have been adopted in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, and the suburb of Pelham in Birmingham, Alabama. According to Birmingham's city code, premises should be ""maintained in such a condition so as not to . constitute an eyesore or unfavorable appearance or dangerous condition, . including any unpainted, decaying or unused automobile or other vehicle, . or rubbish or any other condition offensive to the appearance of said . premises."" In Massapequa Park, owners have ten days to rectify breaches of the law, before fines are imposed. First-time offenders who fail to fix broken outdoor lights or remove fallen trees could be fined up to $1,000 (£643), with further offences leading to five-figure fines and jail time. James Altadonna Jr, mayor of Massapequa Park, has welcomed the new measures and says they could be adopted across America . The law, which was passed on Monday, states: 'The Village finds that the presence of blight upon properties, . caused by factors including, but not limited to, foreclosures throughout . the Village, is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the . Village. 'It is the intent, therefore, of the Village . that blight be identified, abated and eliminated.' Mr Altadonna added: 'You’re not going to see houses with broken windows [in Massapequa . Park]. But how would you feel living across the street . from a house that has 18 inches of grass in front of it?' Meanwhile, at least two people have spent time behind bars in recent months for failing to maintain their homes. In January, Linda Ruggles, 53, from Mount . Pleasant, South Carolina, was sentenced to ten days in jail after failing to pay a . $480 fine for a having a messy yard. A month later, a Florida man was reportedly sentenced to a year and one day in jail after he failed to remove litter from the front of his house. He had broken the conditions of his probation, which were connected to illegal dumping charges.","Homeowners in Long Island village face fines for messy gardens, graffiti and broken windows .

This terrified 13-year-old was lucky not to be badly hurt after an adventure turned sour and he was forced to cling to a crumbling cliff at least 30ft above a rocky beach. Numerous paramedics, 20 firefighters, four police officers and eight coastguards were needed to save the teenager who had got marooned in Whitehaven, Cumbria as the tide swept in under him. Onlookers said the unnamed boy was stuck at the ocean’s edge for more than 40 minutes until he was rescued yesterday. Don't look down: More than 30 rescue workers were needed to save the teenager seen here hanging dangerously from the middle of the rock . Gently does it: A rescue worked ties ropes to the boy to ensure that if he falls he'd be safe . A multitude of vehicles tore through the town and its surrounding water, including three fire engines with a rescue van, two police cars, two coastguard vehicles, and one lifeboat. Ropes were used to gently lift the teenager, understood to be from London, to safety in a joint effort by the coastguard and the fire service. Michael Amor, 18, of Whitehaven, who had been watching the rescue, said: 'He is only a little lad. He must have been terrified. 'He had been using the skate park earlier with his mates.

We're coming to get you: A brave rescuer slowly eases his way down to the boy, who got stuck . The works: A large amount of people and equipment was needed on the Whitehaven beach to save him before the tide swept in . 'There is another access to it on the other side and it looks as though the boy must have been trying to climb down when he got stuck. 'Older teenagers go out there to drink, it is not a place younger children normally go.” Two fire engines from Whitehaven and one from Workington in Cumbria attended the scene along with their major rescue vehicle. A fire service watch manager and a station manager also attended . along with the ambulance service, police and Coastguard. Nearby St Bees' lifeboat was also alerted. A spokesman for the Whitehaven Coast Rescue Team said: 'The boy had climbed 30ft of the 40ft shale outcrop on the beach at Whitehaven, when he became stranded on a crumbling ledge. Rescue: One lifeboat came to the scene and another was on standby amid fears for the teenager's safety . Between a rock and a hard place: The boy was saved from two directions . 'Fortunately he managed to alert a family member to his predicament and the police were called who informed the coastguard. 'We were alerted and deployed a cliff rescue team to the top of the outcrop and a water rescue team to stand by at the base of the rock as the tide was rapidly flooding. 'The team managed to reach the boy from the top of the outcrop and lowered him down the more stable seaward side of the rock. 'The rescue was made difficult and dangerous due to the shale make-up of the rock making the cliff face unstable and slippery. There was a constant danger of either the youth slipping off the ledge, or the ledge itself crumbling away.'","The terrified Londoner was clinging on for 40 minutes until he was rescued in Whitehaven, Cumbria ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:06 EST, 28 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:48 EST, 28 April 2012 . U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has called for a federal law to ban talking on a cell phone or texting while driving any type of vehicle on any road in the country. Tough federal legislation is the only way to deal with what he called a 'national epidemic,' he said at a distracted-driving summit in San Antonio, Texas, that drew doctors, advocates and government officials on Thursday. LaHood said it is important for the police to have 'the opportunity to write tickets when people are foolishly thinking they can drive safely or use a cell phone and text and drive.' National epidemic: U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, pictured in 1998, called for a federal law to ban talking on a cell phone or texting while driving . LaHood has previously criticized behind-the-wheel use of cell phones and other devices, but calling for a federal law prohibiting the practice takes his effort to a new level. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 3,000 fatal traffic accidents nationwide last year were the result of distracted driving. Using a cell phone while driving delays reaction time the same amount as having a blood alcohol concentration of .08, the legal limit, the highway agency said. But Gary Biller, president of the National Motorists Association, said laws banning specific actions like talking on a phone or texting are not necessary because those actions are already covered by existing distracted-driving laws. It would be more productive, he said, to invest resources in campaigns that discourage inattentive driving in general. 'It shouldn't matter if the driver is distracted by a conversation with another vehicle passenger, tuning the radio, eating a snack, or talking on a cell phone,' Biller said in a statement. 'Existing laws cover all those distractions and more.' Dangerous: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 3,000 fatal traffic accidents nationwide last year were the result of distracted driving . LaHood said, however, he was not as concerned about people who eat, apply makeup, or perform other distracting activities in cars because 'not everyone does that.' 'But everyone has a cell phone and too many of us think it is OK to talk on our phones while we are driving,' he said at the summit, sponsored by insurance company USAA, the Texas Department of Transportation and Shriners Hospitals for Children. LaHood was joined by people who have been hurt in accidents caused by motorists talking on cell phones, including children in wheelchairs who were paralyzed. Such accidents are '100 per cent preventable,' he said. He compared the situation facing the United States today with the problem of drunk driving 20 to 30 years ago. 'It used to be that if an officer pulled you over for drunk driving, he would pat you on the back, maybe call you a cab or take you home, but he wouldn't arrest you,' LaHood said. 'Now that has changed, and the same enforcement can work for people who talk on cell phones while driving.' Thirty-eight states have laws restricting or outlawing the use of electronic devices while driving, LaHood said. LaHood said his department was researching the effect that hands-free devices and new systems like Ford Motor Company's Sync have on distracting drivers. He said he has called the CEOs of major car companies and encouraged them to 'think twice' before placing too many Internet-based systems into new cars.","3,000 U.S. fatalities from distracted driving last year ."

Millions of passengers face air chaos during this Summer's Olympics unless the Government acts now to prevent a disaster, British Airways and the UK's leading airlines have warned Transport Secretary Justine Greening. In a leaked letter obtained by the Daily Mail, the bosses of BA, Virgin Atlantic, BMI British Midland and Easyjet warn Miss Greening and her aviation team that they will be acting in a 'foolhardy and reckless' manner if they ignore the warnings contained in their two-page missive. The near apocalyptic letter spells out how the airlines, air traffic controllers and the aviation industry believe ministers have not been listening to their repeated warnings of the impending chaos at airports and in the airspace above Britain and have rejected up to five solutions. British Airways is among the airlines that have warned the Government there could be chaos at Heathrow Airport (pictured) this summer . Now 'time is running out.' It states bluntly that there is now a 'significant risk of severe delay and disruption at all of London's major airports unless urgent action is taken' causing misery to the millions of passengers who will fly into the Olympics this summer. The airlines also warn of their 'significant concerns that insufficient progress has been made regarding the resilience of the airspace' through which thousands of planes will take off and land during the sporting extravaganza. The letter says: 'All of the major UK airlines, major airport operators and NATS believe that further action can and must be taken to ensure the impact on both ""business as usual"" travellers and visitors to London 2012 is reduced and that appropriate mitigation is available in advance of and during the period of the Games. 'As the situation currently stands, the industry believes that there is a significant risk of severe delay and disruption at all of London's airports unless urgent action is taken.' The words 'urgent action' are printed in bold to ram home the point. The letter gives a stark ultimatum to the Government about the scale of the impending crisis, concern about ministerial inaction, and an action plan of what needs to happen before a crunch meeting set for March 22. The letter says bluntly: 'Time is running out to ensure that any changes to proceedings and the appropriate training is in place prior to the games. 'We urge both the DFT (Department for Transport) and the CAA to support and agree to the proposals that the industry, including NATS, have put forward.' The letter stresses that an agreed solution is 'vital before the March 22 meeting if we are to succeed in our joint objective of ensuring that we as an industry play our part in ensuring commercial air travel to and from London for the Games is a complete success'. But in a stunning ultimatum to ministers by the airlines the letter says: 'Failure to respond leaves the UK vulnerable to the type of major disruption that will cause significant reputational damage and would be foolhardy and reckless.' Warned: Transport Secretary Justine Greening was told Heathrow will struggle to cope the amount of flights laid on for the Olympics . The letter was sent by the operations chiefs of the four major airlines whose emblems fly at the top of the first page  – BA, Virgin Atlantic, Easyjet, and BMI British Midland. It was sent to Jonathan Moore, the Director of Airport Strategy at the Department of Transport and to Andrew Haines, chief executive officer of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The letter was copied in to Transport Secretary Justine Greening, Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers and a host of leading industry figures including BA chief executive Keith Williams, BA's Willie Walsh who is chief executive parent company IAG; Virgin Atlantic boss Steve Ridgway, Easyjet boss Carolyn McCall, the head of airport operator BAA, Colin Matthews and the head of Britain's air traffic controllers at NATS Richard Deakin. It is signed by British Airways' director . of operations Andy Lord, BMI's head of operations and crewing Sean . Butler, Virgin Atlantic's director of operations, safety and security . Corneel Koster, and Easyjet's chief operations officer Warwick Brady. The Games, most of which will take place at the Olympic Park (pictured) in Stratford, east London, is expected to put extra stress on London's transport network . One insider close to the row said that the major airlines and air traffic controller bosses had together come up with a list of potential solutions to the expected air chaos caused by the extra traffic during the Olympic period – particularly the three days before the Games, the period of the men's 100 metres final, and the period immediately after the closing ceremony. The senior source said frustrated airline chiefs believe ministers are 'burying their heads in the sand' by suggesting that the industry had raised no concerns. Their letter, dated Thursday March 15  and copied in to Miss Greening and her team, is their riposte to that. The insider said: 'We can't just wait until July and then say 'Houston – or rather Heathrow – we have a problem. Ministers must deal with it now.' 'It's like cars on the M25. On a quiet Sunday morning, it's fine and everyone can cope. But on a Friday evening or a busy Bank Holiday, it doesn't take much for the whole system to end in gridlock. And that's the message we're trying to get across to ministers.' Another aviation insider said: 'This will affect millions of passengers at the busiestt time of the year and cause mayhem. The skies above Britain and its airports will be gridlocked.' In simple terms, the airlines and air traffic controllers have been calling for more flexibility to prioritise the bigger airports such as Heathrow and Gatwick over smaller airports such as Farnborough in Surrey during times of highest demand. The airlines believes 'insufficient progress' has been made with the CAA and the government when planning to cope with the expected extra flights, the impact that sudden and adverse weather could have if flights are cancelled, the impact of a 'security event' or the response of the security services to it, the effect of non-scheduled additional general aviation and business traffic, and even the impact of aeroplanes and helicopters used by television companies to get aerial shots. The airlines say they sought additional 'resilience measures' from the Department for Transport last December. Measured sought additional 'temporary permissions' to allow airports, airlines and air traffic controllers to operate more flexibly and 'differently' during the Games. But these were denied. The letter sets out how air traffic controllers recently presented 'five different options for prioritising air traffic' in the southeast of England. But it was rebuffed because the CAA claimed that under the current terms of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) licence, the CAA 'could not consent' to any revisions of the traffic management criteria during the Olympic period. Damningly, the letter adds: 'Further, we understand that the DFT are under the impression that industry is satisfied with the steps taken so far – this is far from the truth.' It warns ministers and aviation chiefs bluntly: 'Time is running out.' The airlines conclude to ministers: 'As a group, we encourage you both to ensure that the appropriate action is taken to enable the industry to deliver the service that is so critical to the success of London 2012, and we and our teams are available to provide whatever support and clarity is needed to enable the right outcome.' Earlier this year, airport officials admitted that passengers arriving at Heathrow during the Olympics face the threat of baggage chaos as thousands of athletes and officials bring in up to three times as much luggage as normal. Heathrow said there will be a 45 per cent increase in the number of passengers arriving on July 26 alone, the day before the Olympics' opening. National Air Traffic Services which is responsible for controlling aircraft flying in UK airspace and the eastern part of the North Atlantic said despite measures already in place there is 'still a risk of delay and disruption during the Games' In a statement it said: 'NATS is committed to a successful Olympics for our customers and for the UK. For us, this means ensuring flights pass through the UK air traffic system safely and as efficiently as possible. 'With this goal in mind, we will have implemented new airspace, procedures, operational radar positions, facilitated MOD security airspace measures and communicated to the aviation community the changes they can expect during the Games.' But significantly it added: 'There is, however, still a risk of delay and disruption during the Games. This may be from security incidents, runway over capacity or bad weather (e.g. thunder storms). ' We continue to work closely with the wider industry and with the Civil Aviation Authority and Government to find the right mechanisms and responses to these issues.' A CAA spokesman said: 'Managing air traffic during the Olympic period will require careful co-ordination between NATS, the aviation industry, the CAA and Government. 'A range of proactive measures have already been put in place to help manage airspace as a whole network during the Olympics, and we will continue to work very closely with NATS, the Government and the aviation industry to prepare for the Games and ensure that everything possible has been done to effectively manage UK airspace.' A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: 'The Government is committed to delivering safe and efficient transport services for the 2012 London Olympic Games, and aviation is clearly a major part of this. 'That is why we have already announced a range of special measures designed to protect scheduled air services from disruption during the Olympics period. 'We are confident that the majority of these additional issues have now been addressed and we look forward to discussing them with the airlines concerned at a meeting next week. 'We continue to work closely with the CAA, NATS and the industry to ensure any disruption is kept to a minimum.'","Bosses of Virgin Atlantic, BMI British Midland and Easyjet join forces with BA .

"By . Lawrence Conway . PUBLISHED: . 16:20 EST, 3 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:42 EST, 3 May 2012 . Police have begun removing the last anti-war protest tent outside the Houses of Parliament. The move came after the High Court lifted an injunction leaving Westminster Council free to clear the tent from Parliament Square. The injunction had been in place . while veteran peace campaigner Maria Gallastegui challenged the legality . of new bylaws giving the council power to remove tents and sleeping . equipment from the road and pavement around the square. Removal: Police officers removing the last of the anti-war protest tents outside the Houses of Parliament . Ms Gallastegui, 53, has been conducting an authorised 24-hour vigil on the east pavement of Parliament Square since 2006 and obtained her injunction against the council preventing it from enforcing the bylaws. She co-operated with police officers as they moved her tent into a removal vehicle, even helping them to lift it. She said: 'This is not the end. We . are going to go to the Court of Appeal. If we lose at the Court of . Appeal we are going to go to Strasbourg.' However, she added: 'In a way this is a liberation for me. It is a big responsibility for me to have this in Parliament Square. Last chapter: The last anti-war protest tent in Parliament Square is loaded onto a van by the police . Removed: A large box which was the focal point of Ms Gallastegui's site could be auctioned off to raise money for an Iraqi orphanage . 'Of course it is also a very profound statement, that is why I wanted to make the signs so large. It has had a big impact, bigger than I could ever have imagined. 'My site has been photographed every day.' Ms Gallastegui has been offered assistance by Westminster Council to find temporary housing. Westminster Council leader Philippa . Roe said: 'We have worked hard to find a solution to this problem . without prohibiting the rights for free speech and protests. However, for some time what is a public open space has been dominated by tents and encampments which have restricted its use. Protest: Maria Gallastegui standing outside her Parliament Square protest box in May this year . 'The High Court also took this view after a full and fair hearing. It concluded the protesters did not have the right to inhabit a public square designed for everyone to use. 'Throughout this process we have sought to find a solution by talking to the protesters involved. 'People will always be allowed to protest in Parliament Square - what is not reasonable is setting up permanent camps there.' The case arose after the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act came into force which authorised the local council and police to remove sleeping facilities, including tents. Last hurrah: Ms Gallastegui co-operated with police officers even helping them to lift her protest tent from Parliament Square . They can also remove equipment used for noisy protests. Many have regarded protest tents in the square as an eyesore before the Diamond Jubilee and Olympics. Lifting the injunction preventing the removal of Ms Gallastegui's tent, High Court judge Sir John Thomas said the new bylaws were not interfering with Ms Gallastegui's democratic right of protest - a right the courts 'jealously guard'. He said: 'The right to protest is not affected save to a very, very limited extent that the claimant cannot have a tent or other similar facility in Parliament Square.' Police officers said that once removed, the large box which is the focal point of Ms Gallastegui's site will be kept for 28 days, unless it is claimed, before it can be destroyed. Ms Gallastegui said that she intends to claim the box and auction it to raise money for an orphanage in Iraq.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 23:53 EST, 15 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:35 EST, 16 May 2012 . A bomb targeting a hardline former interior minister killed two of his bodyguards and injured at least 39 people in Bogota's uptown commercial district Tuesday in the type of brazen attack not seen in Colombia's capital in years. The former minister and morning radio host, Fernando Londono, suffered minor wounds and was out of danger after being operated on to remove glass shards from his chest, authorities said. Video footage showed a stunned Londono, his face bruised, being led from the wreckage in a dark suit and red tie. Bogota Mayor Gustavo Petro said a pedestrian attached an explosive to a door of Londono's armored SUV and set it off remotely. He said authorities had video of the attack. Bloodied: Former Colombian Interior Minister Fernando Londono, who is injured, walks as he is guarded by a bodyguard after an explosion in a central avenue in Bogota on Tuesday . The attacker 'walked away disguised' and a wig of long black hair and a hat were found in the area, Petro told reporters. It was the first fatal bombing in the capital in nearly a decade of an apparently political nature and it traumatized a capital that two decades before had been ravaged by car bombs set by drug traffickers fighting extradition to the United States. Bogota's police chief, Gen. Luis Eduardo Martinez, blamed the country's main leftist rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, though without offering any evidence. But President Juan Manuel Santos said immediately afterward that it was too early to assign blame, and he announced a $277,000 reward for information leading to those responsible. 'We don't know who is behind this attack,' he said after meeting with police and military brass, Bogota's mayor and the chief prosecutor. He said, however, that the FARC was behind a car bomb that was detected and deactivated elsewhere in the capital earlier Tuesday. Santos, who as defense minister in 2006-2009 dealt major setbacks to the rebels, vowed in response to the attack to 'eliminate terrorism from the face of the earth.' Attack: The bomb, detonated in a commercial district of Colombia's capital Bogota killed two people on Tuesday and injured Londono, who was the target, President Juan Manuel Santos said . Rush to aide: Police and firefighters work at the scene . Calling for help: An injured man lies on the road at the scene of an explosion in a central avenue in Bogota . Good Samaritans: Pedestrians assist a wounded man . Santos said Londono, 68, had in the past received death threats and had a sophisticated protection scheme involving about 19 bodyguards. An archconservative and a stringent critic of the FARC, Londono was interior and justice minister in 2002-2003 under former President Alvaro Uribe. He hosts a daily radio show called 'The Hour of Truth' and firmly opposes peace talks with the FARC, calling the rebels 'terrorists' and 'murderers.' He has also been critical of Santos for allegedly being soft on the rebels, who have stepped up attacks in recent months. Under Uribe, Colombia's U.S.-backed military succeeded in diminishing the FARC's numbers by roughly half to about 9,000 currently, with increasingly effective bombings that prompted record desertions. Colombia's capital became progressively safer, the conflict increasingly limited to less populated hinterlands. The last major bombing in Bogota was in 2003, when the FARC devastated the exclusive El Nogal social club, killing 36 people. The cocaine trade-funded FARC was also blamed for a pre-dawn bombing outside a building housing Caracol radio in August 2010 that injured nine people. Londono's driver and a police bodyguard were killed in the attack shortly before midday on Calle 74 a half block from Caracas Avenue. It was not immediately clear where in the SUV the bodyguard was sitting. The affected district is packed with offices, stores, restaurants and banks and video of the scene after the blast showed people screaming as police and firefighters assisted the wounded, some with bloodied faces. Survivor: An injured woman, with her face covered in blood, walks at the scene of an explosion in a central avenue . Nightmare: An injured man sits inside an ambulance after the explosion . Carnage: Police stand at the scene after a bomb exploded in Bogota, Colombia on Tuesday . Catalina Ballesteros, a 24-year-old student, was in a bus that was badly damaged by the blast. She said she was surprised at the concentrated force. 'After the explosion it was chaos,' said Ballesteros, who suffered only cuts. She said she saw one man on the street who had fainted. Santos said 39 people were injured. Londono was operated on at the Clinica del Country hospital to close skin wounds and remove glass shards from his chest, said the hospital's director, Jorge Ospina. Ospina said the only person seriously injured in the blast was a 38-year-old passer-by who needed surgery and was in danger of losing his right arm. Earlier Tuesday, police said they had deactivated a car bomb, a Renault 9 whose trunk contained the explosive indugel, in the center of the city. Santos said its target was apparently a police station in a neighborhood named for his great uncle, former President Eduardo Santos. The driver, who was arrested, 'made a series of confessions,' he said, indicating the FARC was to blame. Santos considers himself a progressive and, in addition to a military hard line against the FARC, has sought to return stolen land to peasants and pay reparations to victims of Colombia's long-running civil conflict. The FARC was blamed by authorities for two bombings in February in provincial Colombia that killed at least 16 people, and military analyst Alfredo Rangel said he suspected it in Tuesday's bombing because of Londono's hard line against the rebels. Crushed: Security officers stand next to a damaged bus at the scene . Chaos: Police officers work at the scene of a bomb blast which killed three people and injured 19 . Totaled: Cars were crunched like soda cans in the street . Leftist congressman and human rights activist Ivan Cepeda said he feared the attack could trigger other acts of violence, including targeting the left. 'I see a clear intent to destabilize,' Cepeda said, blaming 'sectors who don't want peace.' Political scientist Vicente Torrijos of the Universidad del Rosario supported the theory that the FARC was to blame as it 'seeks to show itself to the world as an organization sufficiently strong militarily and no only a weak organization that is only looking to negotiate with the government.' The FARC has been seeking peace talks and last month released what it said were its last 'political prisoners,' 10 police and soldiers held for as many as 14 years. In newspaper columns and on the radio, Londono hasn't just attacked the FARC as standard-bearer of Colombia's right wing. He also firmly defends Uribe against allegations that the former president was too cozy with backers of illegal far-right militias. Dozens of political allies of both men have been imprisoned on criminal conspiracy convictions for colluding with the militias. The militia leaders made peace with Uribe's government but most of their top leaders were extradited to the United States, where they are serving prison terms on drug trafficking convictions. The FARC, meanwhile, suffered serious setbacks under Uribe, who left office in 2010, but continue to inflict casualties on security forces in ambushes and hit-and-run attacks. It currently holds a French journalist who was accompanying security forces on a drug lab-destroying mission when rebels detained him two weeks ago. The FARC said on Sunday that it intends to free him soon.","Pedestrian attached explosive to door of Fernando Londono's armored SUV and set it off remotely, according to Bogota mayor .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:57 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:07 EST, 1 May 2012 . A former Rutgers University student who was found guilty of hate crimes for using a webcam to view his roommate kissing another man has asked a judge to overturn the jury's conviction. In a legal filing Tuesday, Dharun Ravi's lawyers said the jury convicted him in March despite evidence that he was not guilty of invading the privacy or intimidating roommate Tyler Clementi, who killed himself days after the webcam was used. And on the most disputed and serious charges — bias intimidation — the lawyers say the law was misused. Legal filing: Lawyers for Dharun Ravi (left) said the jury convicted him evidence that he was not guilty of invading the privacy or intimidating roommate Tyler Clementi (right) On some of those counts, the jury found . that Ravi did not mean to intimidate Clementi or the other man, but that . Clementi reasonably believed he did. Jurors said as much both in their findings in court and in comments afterward to journalists. Copies of some news articles were included with the brief to support Ravi's lawyers' position. 'To criminalize a defendant for a victim's mistaken belief about the defendant's motive would turn the bias intimidation statute into a mockery of itself,' wrote the lawyers, Steven Altman and Philip Nettl. It is standard practice for lawyers to ask for a judge to overturn a conviction after a jury delivers it. In Ravi's case, the request is for the judge to acquit Ravi entirely — or at least grant him a new trial. Filing: Ravi's lawyers said he was convicted despite evidence he was not guilty. One of his defense attorney's, Philip Nettl is pictured second left, as Ravi (centre) is supported by his father, Ravi Pazhani (second right) The lawyers said that the jury was wrong on invasion of privacy charges because the snippets video that Ravi and others saw did not show sexual acts or nudity. Prosecutors had no immediate comment on the court filing. But they're sure to have more to say in coming weeks as they file papers to recommend a sentence for Ravi. He could face 10 years in prison when he's sentenced on May 21. And because he's a citizen of India, where he was born, Ravi could also be deported eventually because of the conviction. The case has enflamed passions. Almost immediately after his suicide in September 2010, Clementi came to be seen as a symbol of the bullying young gays can face. President Barack Obama spoke out about the case and talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres made it a key cause of hers. Potential: Tyler Clementi was a talented violin player before he killed himself by jumping off the George Washington bridge . Some have come to see Ravi as a victim of an overzealous legal system, a man convicted not so much for what he did but what happened afterward. Last month, former Gov. Jim McGreevey, who left office in 2004 after announcing he was gay, wrote an opinion piece in The Star-Ledger newspaper arguing against a prison sentence for him. While there is much dispute in court and elsewhere about how the law should be applied in the case, there is little disagreement over the facts. Jurors heard that Clementi and Ravi, both 18-year-old freshmen from well-off New Jersey suburbs who were assigned at random to be roommates, did not speak much. A few weeks into the school year, Clementi asked Ravi for the room when he was planning to have over a man he'd met online. Jurors heard that Ravi was nervous about the iPad he'd left in their room and wondered what was going on, so he and a friend turned on his webcam and saw seconds of, as Ravi described in a tweet, his roommate 'making out with a dude'. Two nights later, when Clementi asked for privacy again, Ravi obliged. Heartbreak: Tyler's parents, Joseph and Jane Clementi, were said to be happy with the original verdict . This time, he told friends through text messages, tweets and in-person conversations how they could connect with his webcam to see what happened between Clementi and his guest, who testified at the trial but was only identified by the initials M.B. because he's considered the victim of a sex crime. But the webcam was off that night. By the time of that second rendezvous, Clementi had learned that Ravi had watched him and he initiated a request for a room change. The next night, Clementi, a violinist, made his way to the George Washington Bridge and jumped to his death, leaving behind a final Facebook status: 'jumping off the GW bridge, sorry'. Jurors found Ravi guilty of all 15 counts he faced, including bias intimidation, invasion of privacy and tampering with evidence and a witness to try to cover up the other crimes.","His lawyers say the jury convicted him despite evidence he was not guilty of invading Tyler Clementi's privacy .

"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 09:01 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:34 EST, 1 May 2012 . A judge rejected shamed former IMF leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s claim for diplomatic immunity, saying the defence was a ‘Hail Mary' pass. Bronx state Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon wrote in his decision that ‘his voluntary resignation from the IMF terminated any immunity which he enjoyed. ‘Mr Strauss-Kahn threw (legally speaking, that is) his own version of a Hail Mary pass,’ he wrote. Hail Mary: A judge has rejected DSK's request for immunity, calling it a 'Hail Mary' pass. The former IMF chief, pictured in Manhattan Criminal Court last May . Judge McKeon said that as soon as Strauss-Kahn willingly resigned as the chief of IMF, he surrendered any immunity he had. The judge heard arguments in March on the civil case that emerged from the May 2011 hotel-room encounter that also spurred now-dismissed criminal charges against Strauss-Kahn, then a French presidential contender. The episode was the first in a series of allegations about the sexual conduct that sank his political career. Ms Diallo's lawyers issued a statement calling the ruling 'well-reasoned and articulate.' 'We have said all along that Strauss Kahn's desperate plea for immunity was a tactic designed to delay these proceedings and we now look forward to holding him accountable for the brutal sexual assault that he committed,' they wrote. Strauss-Kahn's attorneys had no immediate comment on the ruling. Accused: DSK was accused of raping a maid at the Sofitel Hotel in Midtown Manhattan . Accuser: Nafissatou Diallo (seen in August 2011) claimed DSK tried to rape her in May 2011 when she entered his suite to clean his room . He has been weighing whether or not to allow the lawsuit to go forward. The housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, 33, said Strauss-Kahn, 63, tried to rape her when she arrived to clean his suite at the posh Sofitel Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Strauss-Kahn has denied doing anything violent during the encounter.Prosecutors dropped related criminal charges last summer, saying they had developed doubts about her trustworthiness because she had lied about her background and her actions right after the alleged attack. She has insisted she told the truth about what happened in the encounter itself. Out to lunch: DSK was seen in Paris last month getting a bite to eat . Strauss-Kahn didn't assert immunity from the criminal prosecution, and he resigned his IMF job days after his arrest. But his lawyers argued he should be immune from the lawsuit, which was filed about three months later. They say his job title afforded him the luxury under international rules. But Ms Diallo's lawyers said the immunity claim is off base. They stressed that an IMF spokesman said shortly after Strauss-Kahn's arrest that he didn't have immunity because he was on personal business during his encounter with Ms Diallo. Strauss-Kahn was visiting his daughter in New York. The Associated Press generally doesn't name people who report being sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Ms Diallo has done. After Strauss-Kahn's arrest in New York, a French writer came forward to say Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her during a 2003 interview. Faithful: Anne Sinclair has stayed by her husband's side throughout the accusations and criminal trial; she is seen next to Strauss-Kahn for a criminal hearing last June . Paris prosecutors said that accusation was too old to try, but French authorities have pursued an unrelated allegation that he was involved in a hotel prostitution ring including prominent city figures and police in Lille. In March, he was handed preliminary charges, which mean authorities have reason to believe a crime was committed but allow more time for investigation. His French lawyer said the married Strauss-Kahn engaged in 'libertine' acts but did nothing legally wrong and is being unfairly targeted for his extramarital sex life.","Bronx judge ruled today that DSK gave up any immunity when he voluntarily resigned from IMF position .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:09 EST, 30 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:19 EST, 30 April 2012 . The flight of a blind Chinese activist to the US Embassy has sparked a diplomatic standoff between American diplomats and Chinese officials, who suspect Washington is trying to undermine the Communist government. The flight of Chen Guangcheng, a campaigner for disabled rights and victims of forced abortions, is a challenge for China's authoritarian government and, if it's confirmed he is in U.S. custody, for Washington too. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell began a hurried mission to Beijing on Sunday to smooth the way for annual talks involving his boss, Hillary Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and scores of officials. Concerns: Fears are growing for He Peirong, left, who has been detained for her involvement in the plot to free Chen Guangcheng, from house arrest . Chen's whereabouts have yet to be . confirmed. Activists in China and overseas have said Chen is either . under U.S. protection or in the U.S. Embassy. Chen's escape comes as the Chinese . leadership is already reeling, trying to heal divisions over the ousting . of a powerful politician, Bo Xilai, and complete a once-a-decade . transition to a new generation of leaders. As in Chen's case, the U.S. is . implicated: Bo's ouster was precipitated by the sudden flight of an aide . to the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu. While the aide, Wang Lijun, gave . himself up to Chinese authorities the incident and Chen's escape . reaffirm long-held suspicions by Beijing that the U.S. wants to undermine . the communist government. Late last week, the White House, in a . reversal, said it was considering selling new warplanes to Taiwan – the . democratic island China claims as a breakaway territory. It's not known what Chen's intentions . are: some say he wants to stay in China. But negotiating any exit from . US custody is likely to be difficult for the Obama administration. Beijing is likely to be wary of any concessions, fearing they might . embolden other activists. Rounded up: Activists fear for the safety of Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, pictured with the activist and their son . Without confirming if Chen is in U.S. hands, Obama's counterterrorism adviser John Brennan said the president . would work to further human rights while preserving ties with Beijing. 'I think in all instances the . president tries to balance our commitment to human rights, making sure . that the people throughout the world have the ability to express . themselves freely and openly, but also that we can continue to carry out . our relationships with key countries overseas,' Brennan said on the US . television news show Fox News Sunday. Complicating any negotiations over . Chen is the treatment of his family. While Chen escaped a week ago from . Dongshigu village and made it 370 miles northwest to Beijing, his wife . and 6-year-old daughter were left behind. The whereabouts of several . other relatives, including Chen's mother and brother, are unknown. Though Chen – a self-taught legal . activist described by friends and supporters as calm and charismatic – . hardly seems a threat, security forces and officials have reacted . angrily, detaining several of his supporters and a nephew who fought . with officials after the escape was discovered is on the run. Retribution: Several members of Chen's family are believed to have been detained following his escape . Police showed up at the home of . veteran activists Zeng Jinyan and Hu Jia, who met with Chen last week . while he was hiding in Beijing. Police took Hu away Saturday for 24 . hours. They questioned Zeng for about a half-hour at home, sounding, she . said, 'very unhappy' about Chen's flight. 'They were really irritated,' Zeng said. 'It was a big shock for them.' Concern is growing for the safety of a . courageous Chinese activist who was detained after helping a blind . dissident escape house arrest. Human rights campaigners believe He Peirong was arrested for her involvement in the plot which freed legal activist Guangcheng, 40, who had been in captivity for almost six years. He Peirong, from Nanjing, had been at the forefront of the campaign to free Chen, a self-taught 'barefoot lawyer' who was jailed for four years and then held for 19 months under heavy guard after exposing forced abortions as part of China's one-child policy. She claimed she had driven Chen to a 'relatively safe place' after he dodged more than 100 guards and broke loose from Dongshigu village, in China's Shangdong province, southeast of Beijing. Chen was then driven 350 miles through the countryside to the U.S. Embassy. Secret meeting: Blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng has spoken to fellow Chinese dissident Hu Jia at an undisclosed location in Beijing . Bob Fu, of Texas-based human rights group China Aid, is reported to have spoken to He Peirong on Friday, but she hung up when she told him 'public security' was at the door. Friends have been unable to contact her since then and her phone was switched off on Friday evening. Police in Nanjing said they knew nothing of the case. High-level talks: The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Kurt Campbell arrived at a hotel in Beijing to discuss the case . One user on Sina's microblog service compared He Peirong to Spider-Man 'bravely going to dangerous places'. The message continued: 'She has been beaten and insulted in [Dongshigu]. 'She keeps her faith and courage.' Activists . now fear for the safety of Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, his six-year-old . daughter, his elderly mother and other family members who they believe . have been rounded up in retribution. HIs nephew, Chen Kegu, was said to be in hiding after using a kitchen knife to defend his mother from intruders. Another activist, Gao Yushan, is also believed to have been detained. Li . Fangping, a rights lawyer who tried to represent Chen in his court . case, told Associated Press that state security had questioned him on . Friday. Sophie Richardson, of Human Rights Watch, said: 'It has been extraordinary – this is high stakes stuff. 'None of these people will have gone into it without a pretty clear idea of what might happen to them as a result. 'That shows extraordinary courage on . the part of activists who are extremely vulnerable to exactly these . kinds of reprisals … In my view, the least other governments can do is . stand with them.' The U.S. has declined to comment on Chen's whereabouts, but a photograph has . emerged of him meeting fellow Chinese dissident Hu Jia at an undisclosed . location in Beijing. China Aid has issued a statement claiming it . 'learned from a source close to the Chen Guangcheng situation that Chen . is under U.S. protection'.

A drug dealer who served five years in prison and left his wife and children for another woman has been allowed to stay in Britain because of his right to family life. Jamaican Richard Blackwood, 36, was jailed for five years for dealing cocaine and heroin to undercover police in Sussex in 2007. But he fought off an attempt to deport him because his family’s human rights were ‘not being respected’. An immigration appeal found an earlier tribunal had not properly considered the detrimental effect deporting him would have on his mistress and their child. Jailed: Blackwood was given five years for dealing Class-A drugs including heroin but was allowed to stay in the country . It did not mention the impact on his abandoned first family. Foreign criminals who serve lengthy prison terms are normally automatically deported but this case will increase concerns over the ease with which many use European Convention on Human Rights legislation to stay in the UK. Blackwood arrived in the UK in 2002 on temporary visa but in 2006 was granted leave to remain because he had married Carmel, a British woman, with whom he had two children. Yet shortly after his marriage three years earlier, he had begun an affair with Melissa Miller from Hove, East Sussex. After his arrest in 2007, Lewes Crown Court heard he had made £81,000 from drug dealing, which he spent on cars, jewellery and travel. He pleaded guilty to eight drug trafficking charges and one of money laundering. On release, Blackwood did not return to live with his wife in the Midlands but moved in with Ms Miller, their four-year-old daughter and her other child, aged eight. The Home Office ruled he should be deported to Jamaica. When Blackwood challenged this, a judge rejected his appeal, but he took his case to the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber and won. Alp Mehmet, of the Migration Watch, said: ‘This is another example of the rights of the individual who has committed crimes being prioritised over the rights of the community in which he has offended.’ Blackwood could not be contacted last night.","Jamaican Richard Blackwood was jailed for five years after selling heroin and cocaine to undercover police .

A British man spent a fortnight in prison in South Africa after police mistook bath salts in his apartment for the illegal drug crystal meth, his lawyer said today. Peter Parnell, 34, from London, was arrested and held in a crowded Cape Town jail before lab tests revealed the granules were just harmless toiletries. Today his lawyer David Mbzwana said the case, which was dropped earlier this month, had 'disturbed him deeply'. Spot the difference: Police mistook bath salts (right) for crystal meth (left) He said: 'Peter has had a very tough time. The whole thing was a complete mess. 'He was held in conditions that are not fit for humans - a prison room that is meant to hold 20 men may be filled with 60. 'Peter's head was in a mess when he came out - it disturbed him deeply. It is just such a relief that no charges were brought. It was ridiculous.' Mr Parnell had been in South Africa nearly three months when officers arrived with a warrant to search his apartment in the Cape Town suburb of Table View on February 29. Mr Mbzwana added: 'The police found 9.5 kilos of the substance, which had an estimated value of ZAR10 million (around £900,000). 'When Peter told them it was bath salts, they arrested him anyway. A fortnight inside: Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, where Peter Parnell was held . 'I'm not aware of why he had such a big pile of bath salts in his place. 'He had arrived in December in South Africa. His fiancée lives here. 'He now is due to leave for Britain as soon as possible, and hopes to put the whole thing behind him.' 'Mr Parnell was held at notorious Pollsmoor prison, where former South African president Nelson Mandela spent part of his 27-year jail term. Earlier this month a hearing at Cape Town magistrates' court saw charges withdrawn, but he was rearrested because his three-month visa had expired while he was in custody. Mr Mbzwana said: 'Immigration officials said Peter had broken the law because he was meant to leave by March 8, but at that time he was behind bars. This was not his fault.' Mr Parnell was given his passport back last week, leaving him free to return to Britain. Possession of the party drug crystal methamphetamine, known locally as 'tik', carries a jail sentence of at least ten years in South Africa. The highly addictive substance has become a widespread problem in the sprawling townships of the Western Cape. It is a stimulant which often provokes violence, and is a factor in South Africa's high gun and knife crime rate. The arrest is understood to have been part of a drugs crackdown operation by the country's elite Hawks police wing. The South African Police Service and Hawks branch declined to comment.","9.5 kilos of bath salts found Peter Parnell's apartment .

A devout Catholic forgave the brute who tried to murder her in a random knife attack today as he was warned he may never be freed. Frail spinster Maria Morrison, 75, was stabbed repeatedly by 23-year old musclemen David Walters because he wanted to 'do some damage to someone' after 'losing face' over a tiff on Facebook. She was waiting for a bus when Walters encountered her by pure chance and repeatedly plunged a 10in kitchen knife into her body screaming 'Die, Die! I'll Kill You.' He then ran off - spitting onto the pavement as he left the scene. Miraculously, despite being close to death Miss Morrison, a retired dressmaker got help by flagging down a passing car and waited with a neighbour as an ambulance went to the scene. Whilst in hospital she was given a crucifix belonging to a Catholic policeman and she used it for spiritual comfort as she won an amazing battle for life. Walters was caught after officers who watched CCTV of the attack went to the spot where he spat and took a DNA sample which matched his profile. Today, Miss Morrison who was said to be in the wrong place at the wrong time relived her terrible ordeal as Walters, of Chorlton, Manchester, pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was given an indeterminate jail term. After the case she said: 'My faith has kept me here. God has given me the strength in that terrible moment in my life - he said it wasn't my time. Jailed: Walters pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was given an indeterminate custodial sentence . 'I know he is there, always. I still . get very emotional. I was trying to push him away with my hands, trying . to pushing him away. He seemed much bigger and stronger than me. 'I . remember my leg was shivering. I was just holding the knife, but I . didn't know if I was actually pushing it away - something gave me the . strength to do something. I thought I was going, but my guardian angel . must have been there to help me.' She added: 'God forgives everyone, so I have got to forgive him. I was so angry, but I forgive him. God will hopefully let him do better. 'I have no idea why he attacked me - it was mad whatever happened to him. It was a moment of madness and he wanted to do damage. But I was so confused at the time - I didn't know what was going on.' 'I don't have any family, so I must . cope the best I can. I cannot do the things I used to enjoy doing . because of the injury to my hand - like painting, sewing and knitting. It's affected me a lot.' 'I get better day by day - I'm a strong person and know I have to do it.' Manchester . Crown Court was told the attack occurred on December 29 last year after . Walters posted a number of threatening messages on Facebook about his . girlfriend being 'poked' by his cousin on the social networking site. He sent a message to his girlfriend saying: 'Now I've lost you I aint got nowt to lose.' After the case Detective Inspector Lee Price, of . Greater Manchester Police, said: 'For every Walters in this world there . are a multitude of people who restore your faith in human nature. 'Maria showed immense courage to . fight him off in the first place and remarkable strength to make such a . good recovery. What happened to her that day would have broken many . people, but she has come through it.' PC Simon Coates who comforted Maria . after the attack and gave her his crucifix said: 'Maria had become . really distressed having to deal with the after-effects of the incident. 'It became apparent she was very . religious and she had asked for a priest to speak with her. I carry a . crucifix on me and I happily gave it to her. 'It was a reassurance to her - she . said it made her feel better. She wrapped it around her hand and I think . it was something she clinged on to. 'She was the perfect person for this . to happen to - because she is uber strong. I have come across some . people that are unable to cope. The way she's dealt with it is . phenomenal.'

Miss Morrison . who attends St Bernadette's Church in Withington where her artwork and . embroidery adorn the walls was sitting on a bench at a bus stop outside . Southern Cemetery when Walters stormed up to her. She . said: 'I wasn't supposed to go out that day, I had just planned to . rest, but my TV broke the day before so I wanted to get someone to fix . it. 'I sat at the bus stop . and I saw the man who looked very angry. He was waving the knife around . and came towards me. When I saw the blade I put my hand up to protect my . face.

Former Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan Jr is sitting in the jail that was named in his honour after pleading guilty to felony possession of methamphetamine and the misdemeanour of soliciting prostitution earlier this week. But now, stunning police surveillance video shows the moment the former sheriff of the year is swarmed by police and arrested in a sting operation. In the video, Sullivan is seen entering the room of one confidential informant, who made a deal to have sex with him in exchange for meth. Scroll down for video . Takedown: Former Arapahoe Sheriff Patrick Sullivan is arrested, seen on the left side of the screen, while the informant, in the orange shirt, covers his face with his hands . The sting: Sullivan can be seen handing the informant black underwear and a shirt . The informant said Sullivan had done this ‘time and time again’ – but once the crimes were committed to video, the arrest was made. The 69-year-old former sheriff was sentenced to 30 days in jail, with two years’ probation. He was also fined $1,100. However, the rest of his charges were dropped in the plea deal. The video was released only two days after he pleaded guilty. It begins with undercover officers doing a check on the equipment and explaining that they’re waiting for Sullivan. Around the five-minute mark, Sullivan enters the bedroom and asks the informant to try on a pair of underwear, saying: ‘See if these might fit you.’ As the informant is seen looking at the underwear, Sullivan says: ‘The problem with that one is, it doesn’t have any real elastic. Maybe too big for you. Try it as we mess around.’ Sentenced: Former Arapahoe County Sheriff Patrick Sullivan, pictured last month, is serving 30 days in the prison named after him . Dry run: An armed officer tests the surveillance equipment prior to the sting . Nobody move: Sullivan, 69, did not resist arrest, but asked that officers be wary of his bad leg . He then takes out a laptop and lounges on the bed, watching a gay porno on his computer. Shame: He once served on a methamphetamine task force . At one point in the video, the informant asks if Sullivan tried any of the meth he’s giving to him, to which Sullivan responds: ‘No, it’s a social issue, why smoke it yourself?’ Minutes later, several police burst into the bedroom, detonating a flash-bang grenade. Sullivan does not resist arrest, but does ask that the police be mindful of his ‘bad leg’ – and ask them not to break it. According to 7News, the video was shot November 29. Deputy Attorney General Michael Dougherty, who investigated the former sheriff, said the law enforcement officer’s actions ‘disgraces the badge.’ Mr Dougherty told the court that Sullivan used the power associated with his position to garner the trust of gay meth users in the area. He said: ‘(Sullivan) became a manipulator, someone who used his position.’ Sullivan served as the county sheriff from 1984 until he retired in 2002, and took part in the Colorado-wide methamphetamine task force in 2000. After retiring, he became director of safety and security for Cherry Creek Schools before stepping down in 2008. Day in court: Patrick Sullivan, left, seen in court on November 30 of last year . The law won: The former sheriff of the year as seen in court last November, on the other side of the law . The good ol' days: Sullivan retired in 2002 but remained active in the community . According to The Denver Post, there were no public hints to show that Sullivan began using meth. However, the shamed former sheriff promises to make amends. He said: ‘I plan to seek forgiveness from those that I have harmed.’ Reading from a statement before his sentence, he said: ‘I apologise to this court, this country, and my family. There is no excuse for my behaviour.’ Watch video here: .","Former Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan, Jr sentenced to 30 days for meth possession and soliciting prostitution .

As London 2012 looks to the future with its sci-fi-style cable cars across the Thames, an artefact has come to light giving a fascinating insight into the capital's Olympic past. This newly uncovered poster showing the medalists of 1908 demonstrates how the games have grown between the first London Olympics and this year's competition. Whereas in 1908 only 2,000 athletes from 22 countries competed in 110 events, this summer will see more than 10,000 athletes from 200 nations competing in over 300 events. The poster depicting the modest band of winners was due to be shown on tonight's Antiques Roadshow, along with memorabilia from the 1908 event held at London's White City Stadium. Champions: A poster showing the modest band of winners from the 1908 London Olympics. In the bottom right is the picture's original owner, announcer William Knightsmith . Dapper: William Knightsmith, a favourite toastmaster of the royals, bellows the scores through a megaphone . These items were originally owned by William Knightsmith, who is pictured with a megaphone on the bottom right of the print. In the days before public broadcast systems, it was his job to relay the action to the stands. But he was not just any sports announcer, according to his great grandson who produced the memorabilia when the BBC's Roadshow team visited Wimbledon. Patrick Stevenson said yesterday: 'My great grandfather was a toastmaster, the most famous in the country. He was the one who ""invented"" the red coat for toastmasters because he didn't want to be mistaken for a waiter. 'He was a favourite of the royals, which is why they asked for him to be their score announcer at the Games. He wore a top hat and relayed the results to the Royal Box by megaphone.' As well as the souvenir poster - which was produced by Gamages, a London department store that closed in 1972 - Mr Stevenson brought to the Roadshow his great grandfather's megaphone and his top hat. Pioneer: The Edwardian toastmaster in his trademark red coat, which he 'invented' to set himself apart from waiters. His great grandson has uncovered the announcer's Olympics memorabilia, including a gold medal . Expert Paul Viney described the poster as 'a wonderful print, showing all the Olympic champions and one or two sports that we don't have these days, such as the tug of war and tandem cyclists.' Mr Stevenson also produced a gold medal won at the 1908 Games in another long-abandoned event. It was won by 25-year-old British runner Emil Voigt, although Mr Stevenson does not know how his family acquired it. Voigt, born in Manchester to German parents, is on the far right of the poster, racing down the track towards William Knightsmith. Mr Viney told Mr Stevenson: 'That's quite incredible: a gold medal in its original leather case inscribed ""Olympic Games Winner, five miles run, London 1908"".  Five miles - they don't do that any more because it's in metres.' Valuation: William Knightsmith's poster and megaphone come under the expert eyes of the Antiques Roadshow team in Wimbledon, London. The megaphone could fetch as much as £2,000 . It was the last occasion on which the five-mile event was run before it was replaced by 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres. On values, Mr Viney said: 'At auction, the medal would probably fetch somewhere between £6,000 and £8,000, and on a good day might even make £10,000.' He said the megaphone could make £1,500 to £2,000. And he valued the poster at £400 to £500. Another figure that has changed markedly since the 1908 Games is the price tag of the event itself. The first London Olympics cost just £20,000 - a tiny fraction of the probable £10billion cost of staging London 2012.","Poster gives a glimpse of the first London Olympics, when just a fifth as many athletes took part .

Officials found the bodies of an elderly man and woman at a destroyed home that was a victim of the still-raging Colorado wildfire that was thought to have started from a protective burn. The couple, who are the only known victims of the blaze so far, were identified as Sam Lamar Lucas, 77, and Linda M. Lucas, 76. A cause of death was pending for both. A third person is missing in the fire zone, authorities said. Jefferson County Sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley said authorities do not know how many houses were lost but said it was at least five and probably more than 10. Earlier on Tuesday, authorities ordered residents of more than 900 homes to evacuate. Warning: Residents of another 6,500 houses were warned to be ready to leave because of the fire's erratic behavior. Many homes are in winding canyons, and authorities wanted to give citizens advance warning . Precautions: Over 100 firefighters were called in from neighboring states, but officials still don't want to completely put out the fire as it will help prevent future blazes . Residents of another 6,500 houses were warned to be ready to leave because of the fire's erratic behavior. Many homes are in winding canyons, and authorities wanted to give citizens as much advance warning as possible. 'We're in a defensive mode, structure protection only,' Ms Kelley said. 'We're not really fighting the fire right now.' Evacuees formed a long line to see a . list of damaged properties posted by the Red Cross at Conifer High . School. Residents groaned when officials told them it wasn't known when . the fire would be contained. 'Know that there are hundreds of . people out there right now working to save your homes,' said Daniel . Hatlestad of the Jefferson County Incident Management Team. That did not satisfy concerned residents. Spared: So far two deaths have been reported along with an unknown number of ravaged homes in the Colorado fire, as this picture near North Fork Wildlife shows the tree damage . Damage: authorities do not know how many houses were lost but said it was at least five and probably more than 10 . Hot hot heat: The fire burned so hot that it melted farm and construction machinery, creating a silver stream of molten metal and softening the soles of deputies' shoes . 'I understand that it's a difficult situation, but it's our house, and we're in the target zone,' John Ryan, 47, said. Jan Quigley said she and her husband . were 'just in a dither' after they got an automated phone call telling . them to evacuate. They grabbed clothes, a backup computer drive and tax . records and left. 'I'm hopeful it will be OK,' she said. About 100 firefighters were expected . to spend the night protecting homes. Officials were calling in help from . as far away as Arizona and hoped to be able to have air tankers drop . fire retardant on the flames Tuesday. Mr Hatlestad said the fire burned so . hot that it melted farm and construction machinery, creating a silver . stream of molten metal and softening the soles of deputies' shoes. The largest fire was burning about 25 . miles southwest of Denver in a rugged, largely rural area where the . altitude ranges from 7,000 to 8,200 feet. The region of pines and . grassland is dotted with hamlets and the occasional expensive home. It . is several miles - and mountain ridges - west of Denver's tightly . populated southwestern suburbs, which weren't threatened. The fire apparently flared up from a . prescribed burn conducted in the area last week, Kelley said. Prescribed . burns are usually done to thin out vegetation in hopes of reducing the . chances of a major wildfire. Dangerous: A plume of smoke rises skyward over the top of a wildfire burning out of control near Conifer, Colorado, on Monday, March 26, 2012 . Destructive: A large plume of smoke rises in the in southern foothills of Denver near Roxborough and Conifer, Colorado, as a wildfire erupted amid dry, windy weather . The fire threat in much of Colorado has grown during an unusually dry and warm March. On March 18, a grass fire charred 37 square miles in eastern Colorado and injured three firefighters. Across the West, most states face normal wildfire danger, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. However, the potential for summer . fires is significantly 'above normal' for New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, . Nevada and California, said center meteorologist Ed Delgado, . 'It's just a changing weather pattern. We're exiting La Nina, and becoming more neutral in that pattern,' Mr Delgado said. 'Historically when we've entered this . weather pattern, we've had situations that would be conducive to those . areas having a higher fire threat.' La Nina is a cooling of the surface water in the Pacific Ocean that causes disruptions to weather patterns. Billows of smoke were visible from . downtown Denver. Weather radar showed the smoke plume had drifted about . 100 miles to the northeast by nightfall, and state health officials . warned smoke could linger and affect air quality until Tuesday . afternoon. Evacuated: Authorities say at least some homes have been destroyed in the mountains west of Denver because of the ferocious flames . Congressman Mike Coffman offered . condolences to the families of his constituents whose homes were . destroyed and said he will work to get federal firefighting teams and . equipment if Jefferson County Sheriff Ted Mink requests them. Another fire was burning near Lookout . Mountain west of Denver, where homes dot the forest along a steep, . winding road with spectacular views.

It's perhaps the most daring naval mission ever undertaken by mankind - sailing on the methane seas of Saturn's icy moon Titan. A new Nasa mission, with UK scientists on board, aims to explore these oceans - by parachuting a vessel into the seas of Titan, just less than a billion miles from Earth. 'It's a boat, essentially.

The 'boat' proposal will be discussed at a conference in London this week . The proposal is to be discussed at a space conference in London this week. Previously, scientists have proposed heavier-than-air gliders to explore the icy moon - or other vehicles that could penetrate the thick clouds that shroud the planet. Nasa's Cassini probe discovered lakes of methane on the planet in 2008. The 'lakes' of Titan contain more . hydrocarbons - the fuels we use cars and other energy supplies - than . the whole supplies of Earth. The moon is thickly shrouded in clouds, and scientists are intrigued about what lies beneath. Titan is bigger than our own Moon and . even the planet Mercury. The temperature at Titan's surface is about . -178 178 degrees centigrade. The planet also has sand dunes, just like ours.

The . similarities end there, of course - not only are the dunes on Titan 300 . feet high and up to a mile wide, they're made of frozen hydrocarbons - . chemicals found in crude oil - rather than sand. There . are four million square miles of dunes on Titan, an area the size of . the United States. Their formations could be key to understanding the . clouded moon's mysterious weather patterns. The huge dunes of frozen hydrocarbons on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan were captured by Nasa's Cassini probe - and the geographical variations on Titan are similar to variations on Earth . Various proposals for the further exploration of Titan have been proposed - including heavier-than-air gliders that would float above the planet . Analysis of images sent back by Nasa's orbiting Cassini probe found that the dunes form patterns similar to deserts on Earth. The result gives new clues about the moon’s climatic and geological history. Dune . fields are the second most dominant landform on Titan, after the . seemingly uniform plains, so they offer a large-scale insight into the . moon’s peculiar environment. Backing this . hypothesis is the fact that Titan’s lakes and seas are not distributed . symmetrically by latitude. These reserves of liquid ethane and methane . are predominantly found in the northern hemisphere, suggesting again . that the soil is moister toward the north and so, again, the sand grains . are less easy to transport by the wind. 'Understanding . how the dunes form as well as explaining their shape, size and . distribution on Titan’s surface is of great importance to understanding .

An Albanian fugitive accused of multiple murders in his home country has been arrested in north London after 15 years on the run. Ndrieim Sadushi, 41, was last night picked up on an international warrant by police outside his home in Southgate. An Albanian court found him guilty in his absence of three killings and an attempted murder in the eastern European country in 1997. At an extradition hearing in Westminster Magistrates' Court today, Sadushi claimed he had been the victim of mistaken identity and was in fact 31-year-old Arjan Kasa. But district Judge Michael Snow ruled . police had got the right man after being told his fingerprints matched those of . the convicted killer. Sadushi, who is said to have used at least six aliases while evading the authorities, will face a life sentence if he is sent back to his homeland. His barrister Richard Hallam stands by the claim that his client is Arjan Kasa. Prosecutor James Stansfeld said that, in addition to being wanted by the Albanian police, authorities in Italy accuse Sadushi of drug trafficking, passport fraud and controlling prostitutes. Italian courts sentenced him to 13 . years and four months in his absence. He has been linked to the notorious Kadeshi armed gang, of which all the other leaders have been arrested. Sadushi is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court today . Hannah Pye, representing the Albanian . authorities, said: 'The request for extradition comes from Albania, . after he was handed a custodial sentence, following a conviction for . five offences.' ‘Those were, the creation and participation in an armed gang, three counts of murder and one attempted murder. ‘For that he was sentenced to life imprisonment, and an appeal against the sentence was upheld by the Albanian appeal court in 2000.’ Officers from the Metropolitan Police’s extradition unit arrested Sadushi outside a property in High Road, Southgate. The UK Border Agency holds no record of him claiming asylum and he is thought to have entered Britain on the back of a truck in 2000. Last year he was one of 14 suspects to have their mugshots released as part of Operation Sunfire, a coordinated effort to bring some of the UK's most wanted fugitives before extradition courts. Twelve of the suspected murderers, rapists and robbers pictured were from eastern Europe, while the other two were wanted in connection with crimes in Italy and Australia.

A six-year-old autistic boy was tied up by his teacher for more than five minutes in front of his class and had to 'beg' to be released, it was claimed today. The woman is being investigated after allegedly using a security pass to bind Scott Lee’s hands behind his back as a punishment. The school, The Meads Infants in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, has launched an investigation into the incident, which allegedly happened last week. Punishment: Scott Lee, 6, allegedly had his hands tied behind his back in front of other children . Police, the local authority and social services are also involved. The child’s irate father, Michael Lee, has demanded the teacher be sacked and prosecuted for the ‘barbaric’ incident and has taken his boy out of the school. He said his son was only released after begging his teacher to untie him. Scott has been accused of retaliating when another boy hit him, which then led to the apparent incident. ‘The past few days have been horrible - as a parent, it’s just awful imagining your own child being tied up,’ Mr Lee said. ‘Scott is a lovely little chap. He’s not disruptive, he’s never aggressive at all. He didn’t deserve this - no kid does.’ Mr Lee claims the school has allowed the teacher to continue in her role pending the outcome of the investigations into her conduct. ‘When I found out what happened I asked her (the teacher) if it was true and she said it was. She was smiling as she admitted what she’d done. She said “I did warn him”. As if that makes what she did ok.’ The Year 2 pupil says he has since suffered nightmares and fears that it will happen to him again if he misbehaves. Mr Lee said a girl in the class told the teacher that Scott had hit a boy back and hit her too, an allegation Scott denies to his father and mother, Samantha, 31. The teacher then allegedly warned Scott that she would tie his hands up if he hit the girl again. Family: Scott with his parents Samantha, left, and Michael . A girl then told the teacher that Scott had hit out again. Mr Lee says his son told him he had to pull his hands behind his back and the security pass was used to tie his wrists in 'figures of eights' behind his back. Moments later, he was apparently ordered to sit on the floor, cross legged. Mr Lee said: ‘The cord was so tight Scott couldn’t free his hands or work them loose. ‘She made him sit in that position in front of the other children in his class for five minutes before she released him.’ The father-of-two heard about the alleged incident the following morning at his son’s swimming class when a classmate told him. The school has launched an internal investigation, which could result in the teacher’s dismissal. Scott, who is the youngest in his year, was initially moved to another class but is now kept away from school. In its prospectus, written in March 2010, the school’s head teacher writes about its policy on discipline. ‘Children are expected to conform to certain standards of behaviour. They are encouraged to show regard for other people, so any punishment or misdemeanour will at all times be moderate,' it says. Last night a spokesman for Dyfed-Powys Police said: 'We are investigating an incident which was alleged to have occurred at a school in Milford Haven on 5 March 2012. Enquiries are continuing.' Last night, Pembrokeshire County Council said - on behalf of social services and the education authority - it could not comment because ‘investigations are ongoing.’ The spokesman confirmed the authority was investigating the incident in addition to the police enquiries.","Scott Lee was forced to beg to be released after allegedly being bound for more than five minutes .

Tasteless pranksters have 'desecrated' the grave of Titanic lookout Fred Fleet - by placing a pair of binoculars underneath his headstone. Sick jokers left the binoculars by the resting place of the man who saw the fateful iceberg, along with a note saying: 'Sorry for bringing these 100 years too late.' Fleet issued the famous words 'Iceberg, right ahead' when he spotted the danger from the ill-fated liner's crow's nest on the night of April 14, 1912. Stunt: The binoculars were placed under Titanic lookout Fred Fleet's headstone in Southampton, Hampshire . But it was later discovered the 25-year-old was not using vital binoculars because they'd been locked away in a cupboard below decks. To make matters worse the keys to the cupboard had been taken on another ship by mistake so it could not be unlocked. At an inquiry into the tragedy Fleet claimed he would have seen the iceberg sooner if he had been issued with a pair. Pranksters who put the binoculars by the grave also left a note and removed wreaths from near the headstone . Fleet survived the sinking, which claimed 1,522 lives, but committed suicide in January 1965 - two weeks after the death of his wife. His grave, with a picture of the Titanic engraved on its headstone, lies in Hollybrook Cemetery, Southampton, Hants. Lookout: Fred Fleet uttered the famous words, 'Iceberg, dead ahead', on the night the Titanic sank . And in the past week it had been laid with wreaths as part of a special ceremony led by the British Titanic Society to mark centenary of the disaster. But now these have been taken and replaced with a pair of binoculars. An attached note reads: 'Dear Fred, sorry for bringing these 100 years too late but better late than never!' The insulting note continues: 'You said if you had these, you would have had time enough to get Titanic away from the iceberg, so here they are! Luv (sic) Francis.' Inquiries into the disaster in Britain and America never blamed Mr Fleet for the tragedy. Maritime historians have also since suggested he did everything he could have at the time and had been a very conscientious lookout. But, despite this, he was taunted in the street about his role in the tragedy and he suffered from an incredible guilt his whole life. Nigel Wright, from the Titanic Society, has blasted the removal of the wreaths from Mr Fleet's grave. He added: 'It is a shocking thing to have happened. This is a desecration. I cannot believe someone would remove a wreath - it is just astounding. 'The binoculars are strange enough but to remove everything is disrespectful to the person who was so pivotal.' He added: 'You cannot blame Fred Fleet for the disaster. It would have been very difficult to use binoculars on the night.' Titanic experts say it would've been unfair to blame Fred Fleet for the ship's sinking, as using binoculars in the middle of the night would have been very difficult anyway . Fleet had worked for more than four years on White Star Line's ship Oceanic before transferring to the Titanic. He earned five pounds a month plus an extra five shillings for the important role as lookout. When Titanic began to sink on the fateful night in 1912, Fleet was one of the crew members assigned to man the lifeboats. He went on to work on Titanic's sister ship Olympic as a lookout and able seaman. He was found hanged in his garden in January 1965. Family said he had become depressed after the death of his wife just two weeks before. He had an unmarked pauper's grave until 1993 when the Titanic Historial Society paid for a headstone.","Fred Fleet uttered words, 'Iceberg, dead ahead' before ship sank in 1912 ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:37 EST, 12 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:19 EST, 12 April 2012 . A crooked custody officer stole a police mugshot to create a Facebook page falsely accusing a heroin dealer of being an informant to help a rival pusher. Within hours of the picture appearing on the social network, the man shown in the picture - 31-year-old Domenico Masciopinto -  had been shot by a gunman. Jonpaul Pasqualone, 28, was jailed for seven years after stealing Masciopinto's mugshot which he posted online with the caption: 'A Police informant since 2009'. Mugshot: Crooked custody officer Jonpaul Pasqualone posted this picture of heroin dealer Domenico Masciopinto on Facebook accusing him of being a police informant . Masciopinto, 31, survived being shot in the chest and the wrist, but has subsequently been jailed for 14 years at Luton crown court after being convicted of two charges of conspiring to supply Class A drugs. Pasqualone, who worked as a £23,000 a year detention and escort officer at Luton Police Station in Beds, hoped to become a police officer. Judge Stephen Gullick said: 'The consequences of what you did resulted in a man being shot - fortunately not fatally. 'Your recompense for what you did was to receive £1,000 in cash. 'When Mr Masciopinto discovered what had happened, he was very annoyed and feared for his own and his family’s safety. 'He was not a police informant and never had been, he was a dealer in Class A drugs based in Bedford. 'He has recently been convicted to conspiring to supply Class A drugs and he is presently serving 14 years in prison.' 'The fact that a man, whoever that man . may be and whatever his antecedents and criminal leanings, was shot as a . consequence of what you did amounts in my judgement to a serious . aggravating feature of your case.' Jonpaul Pasqualone (pictured) got round security measures by simply photographing on screen documents and using his mobile phone . The court heard how Pasqualone had joined Bedfordshire Police in 2010 in a civilian role working in the custody department. Before that, he had worked as a detention officer at Yarlswood Immigration Detention Centre for four years. He had also worked as a custody officer at both Luton Magistrates and Luton Crown Courts. A statement by Bedfordshire Police said that Pasqualone had carried out the offences to help another suspected drug dealer who had been a friend since childhood. The idea had been to disrupt a rival drug supply business by making it appear that Masciopinto was an informant. In the course of his duties Pasqualone had access to a number of computerised information systems which contained highly sensitive and confidential police reports and intelligence. At the end of 2010 Pasqulone, who lived with his girlfriend in a privately owned penthouse flat in Bedford and drove a silver TT Audi with a personal number plate, was contacted by a former friend who had criminal connections. As a result said Peter Shaw prosecuting a week later while working night shifts at Luton Police Station, Pasqualone sat at a computer and under the noses of his bosses accessed a series of intelligence reports relating to the man. Within hours of his mugshot appearing on Facebook Mascipinto was shot . Strict rules govern the viewing of such information and police personnel can only do so for lawful and valid policing purposes. However Pasqualone got round security measures by simply photographing on screen documents using his mobile telephone. The court heard Pasqualone accessed one system known as ‘Boris’ which stood for Bedfordshire Open Research Information Service. But a permanent record is left by anyone accessing Boris, revealing the information that has been obtained. In the days that followed he copied more highly sensitive information following requests by his former friend. On one occasion, Pasqualone downloaded a picture of another associate of his friend and edited the picture with the words ‘Police Informant since 2008.’ Guilty: Pasqualone, 28, was jailed for seven years ay Luton Crown Court . Judge Gullick said he was in no doubt what he had done in relation to this picture was a 'dummy run' for what was to follow, involving Mr Masciopinto’s custody picture. The prosecutor said in December of 2010 his friend visited Pasqualone at the flat in Herron Heights, Bedford that he shared with his girlfriend, Emma Cook. Mr Shaw said 'Emma Cook recalls that the man said to Mr Pasqualone that he wanted more information from him as the information Mr Pasqualone had was not sufficient and he wanted photographs of people that he had named to Mr Pasqualone. 'She saw him pay Mr Pasqualone £500 to £600 for the information from a bundle of notes that he had in his possession and she also heard him say to Mr Pasqualone ‘You will get a another lot or a lot more next time when I get the rest of the information,' said the prosecutor. The court then heard how in January of last year having just got back from a trip to New York with his girlfriend, Pasqualone returned to work at Luton Police Station and accessed information held by the police relating to criminal Domenico Masciopinto who lived in Bedford. He also accessed custody photographs of Mr Masciopinto and once more used his own mobile telephone to photograph the images and information. Mr Shaw said after returning home from work that evening he took the custody images of Mr Masciopinto on his mobile and transferred them to his laptop. The court was told that by using software on his computer, he altered the custody picture by adding the caption 'Police Informant since 2009'. Once more the man who was instructing Pasqualone to get the information came to the flat and was able to leave with it once it had been transferred to his own mobile phone. On this occasion Pasqualone was paid another £5-600 pounds according to his girlfriend. Judge Gullick was told that on Sunday . January 16 2011 pictures of Mr Masciopinto were displayed on the . Facebook networking site with the caption that he was a police . informant. 'Domenico Masciopinto logged onto Facebook and found the relevant account. 'He . saw that it had a picture of him taken whilst he was in Police custody, . he thought in 2010. He saw the text around the picture saying that he . was . ‘A Police Informant since 2009,' said Mr Shaw. He . went on 'Mr Masciopinto was worried that family, friends, associates . and even people that did not know him may believe he was a police . informer and that could put his welfare in jeopardy.' That day as he set about trying to . find out who was responsible, Mr Masciopinto was standing outside his . home in Bedford with a friend and on his phone. Motive: A statement by Bedfordshire Police said that Pasqualone had carried out the offences to help another suspected drug dealer who had been a friend since childhood (file picture) Suddenly . a gunman approached the pair armed with a hand gun. Shots rang out and . Masciopinto was shot in the wrist and the chest. A bullet ended up close to his spine at the back of his neck and he had to undergo an emergency operation. The . following day Pasqualone was arrested. At his flat in Bedford officers . found two prohibited self loading pistols that were on display on a wall . - which he had bought whilst on holiday in Bulgaria. Also discovered at the property was an electronic shock device made to look like a mobile phone. He . pleaded guilty in court to conspiracy to commit an act of misconduct in . a public office, two offences of possessing a prohibited firearm and . possessing a disguised firearm. Mr Shaw said that in an interview Pasqualone claimed he had had been at a cafe in Bedford in November 2010 when he was approached by his former friend who wanted a police picture obtained of Masciopinto with the words Police Informant printed on it. 'He said the man threatened to f... him up if he didn’t assist in editing the photographs with the words. Pasqualone stated that as a result of receiving this threat that he was scared for his own safety and that of his girlfriend and so he agreed to undertake the task requested,' said Mr Shaw.Bozzie Sheffi defending said 'His great regret is that he succumbed to the threat.' The court heard he had been behind a criminal enterprise bringing drugs to Bedford from Bradford. After the hearing today, Beds Police said Pasqualone had formally resigned from his job 'several months ago.' The Assistant Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Police, Andrew Richer, said: 'The image which was posted on Facebook is a copy of a page from the Bedfordshire Police custody system, which is not accessible to outside sources. 'Having used his position as a custody officer, at the request of his friend, to access the page and copy it, Pasqualone then added text to make it appear as if the person was a police informant.'","Jonpaul Pasqualone posted mugshot online with the caption: 'A Police informant since 2009'

And when Sara Palmer stood up and was sick she and husband Joe knew something was seriously wrong. Paramedics rushed the 31-year-old from Ruthin, Wales, to hospital with suspected internal bleeding and dangerously low blood pressure. Once there doctors struggled to find her baby's heart beat. An emergency caesarean followed and premature Isabella, weighing just 5lb 10oz.,  was put in the special care baby unit. But Mrs Palmer continued to haemorrhage blood. Eventually doctors found a tumour on Mrs Palmer's liver and 19 medics spent the next eight hours trying to save her life pumping a massive 56 units (around 46 pints) of blood into her to keep her alive. Journey: Baby Isabella was delivered three weeks early by emergency caesarean section after her mother Sara Palmer started haemorrhaging blood . Struggle: Doctors found a tumour on Mrs Palmer's liver and battled for eight hours and used 56 units (around 46 pints) of blood trying to save her life . One of the specialists later admitted he hoped that night to save at least mother or baby. But both made it through in the end. Now the couple are speaking out about their ordeal and have set up a charity urging people to give blood. For Mrs Palmer, who had been transferred from Wales to a Liverpool hospital, the day's events remain hazy. The school transport officer said: 'I remember opening my eyes and Joe . was sitting by me. He told me we had a little girl, that she was OK and . that we were in Liverpool. 'The baby was in Bodelwyddan (Wales) and I could not get my head around what had happened.' Communications: With Mrs Palmer still tired and weak, and affected by the anaesthetics, she was in and out of consciousness so the couple began writing notes to each other . With Mrs Palmer still tired and weak, and affected by the anaesthetics, she was in and out of consciousness. The couple began communicating by writing little notes. 'I scribbled down some questions and . Joe gave me the answers,' Mrs Palmer said. 'I have kept those notes. I can’t believe some . of the questions I asked. I even asked how Wilsy the cat was!' For Mr Palmer the ordeal has been an emotional rollercoaster. 'I could see they were struggling to . find the baby’s heart beat,' said the 30-year-old builder. 'I didn’t want Sara to know, so just kept . saying that everything was fine. Then suddenly the anaesthetist came in . and said ""we're taking her to theatre, go, go, go"". All's well: Mrs Palmer, her husband Joe and baby Bella are all back at home in Wales taking each day as it comes . When a nurse later came in and asked if he wanted to meet his daughter he had mixed feelings. 'Obviously I was overjoyed that my . daughter was alive, but I felt like I’d cheated Sara meeting her first. I . still didn’t know what was going on with Sara,' he said. 'I just sat there staring at my daughter with a drip in her hand and a pipe coming out of her mouth breathing for her. 'The next seven hours were the worst of my life. 'My brain was in overdrive, running . through everything that had happened - could I have reacted quicker? Would I cope as a single parent? Would my daughter recover but have . brain damage? 'My mind was a cruel enemy that night.' Three days later Mrs Palmer was transferred back to Glan Clwyd Hospital and got to meet her daughter for the first time. Not quite out of the woods: Mrs Palmer unfortunately needs further surgery to remove a benign tumour from her liver . 'I took Isabella in my arms and . walked her in to meet her Mummy for the first time - the most . breathtaking and wonderful moment of my life,' Mr Palmer said. 'Sara’s reaction was beautiful. They bonded instantly together and then sat peacefully together as a family for the first time.' Initially the family's charity Blood4Bella started as a Facebook page so people could donate and replenish the blood stocks used to save Mrs Palmer and Bella. But more than 150 registered immediately . to give a pint of blood leaving Mr and Mrs Palmer overwhelmed by the response. Now the charity has been launched . nationwide. Mr Palmer said: 'We hope our website and story . inspires people to give someone else the opportunity to live. Without . blood donors and the amazing NHS staff we would not have a family.' Barbara Blanche, of NHS Blood and Transplant, said: 'The amount of blood Sara received is more than we collect for example at a whole session in some areas. 'This story drives home just how . important our blood donors are, they really do save and improve lives - . Sara and Isabella are living proof.' Mrs Palmer is now back home at the family home and Isabella is doing well. Unfortunately she needs further surgery to remove a benign tumour from her . liver. She said: 'It’s just good to be home as a family.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:18 EST, 20 January 2012 . Iran's state TV broadcaster was taken off air in the UK today after Britain's media regulator revoked its licence in a move likely to fan diplomatic tensions with the Islamic Republic. Ofcom ruled that Press TV, whose presenters include former MP George Galloway and Tony Blair's sister-in-law Lauren Booth, failed to declare that Tehran rather than London was its editorial base when it was granted the licence. The watchdog said it was apparent that 'editorial control of the channel rested with Press TV International (based in Tehran)'. Scroll down for video . Furious: Former MP George Galloway discusses the Ofcom investigation during his Comment programme on Press TV last May . Making his views heard: Mr Galloway vents his anger on Twitter today after it was announced Press TV was being taken off air . Press TV was also fined £100,000 after broadcasting an interview with a journalist while they were being held in an Iranian prison, which Ofcom said was 'obtained under duress'. Ofcom said Press TV had 'indicated it is unwilling and unable to pay' the fine. The move is likely to stoke further anger in Iran after Britain shut the country's embassy in London and expelled all its staff in November in retaliation at protesters who stormed the British embassy in the Iranian capital. Venting his anger, Mr Galloway tweeted today: 'Champions of liberty the British govt have now taken Press TV off Sky.' High calibre: Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone (left) and Tony Blair's sister-in-law Lauren Booth (right) have also presented shows on Press TV . The channel, which is funded by the Iranian government, says on its website that it has a vision of 'heeding the often neglected voices and perspectives of a great portion of the world'. This is not the first time it has fallen foul of Ofcom. A phone-in TV programme presented by Mr Galloway was criticised by the broadcasting watchdog for breaching impartiality rules in 2010. Ofcom investigated after Mr Galloway's weekly, one-hour English-language programme, Comment, sparked complaints that it was biased against Israel. High profile: Other regular contributors include former Sunday Express reporter Yvonne Ridley (above), who was kidnapped by the Taliban in 2001 . The regulator concluded that 'due impartiality' had not been maintained in individual programmes or across the series. Its English-language service was removed from Sky TV's satellite platform today as a result of the latest decision, but will still be available online. Ofcom said it had offered Press TV the chance to 'have its operations in Tehran correctly licensed' but the channel failed to respond to the offer. In a letter published earlier this month, the channel's chief executive, Mohammad Sarafraz, said Ofcom was part of 'a desperate effort to silence an alternative voice in the UK'. He wrote: 'It is evident that the British Government's campaign against Press TV has its roots in the channel's extensive coverage of the multiple crises created by London's domestic and foreign policies.' Press TV International's presenters have also included former London Mayor Ken Livingstone and Yvonne Ridley, the former Sunday Express journalist kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. It said it 'will do everything possible to make sure that its voice will definitely reach its audience in the UK' and claimed it had been targeted because it 'aired critical views regarding Britain's involvement in wars of aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan'.","Press TV breached rules by running channel from Iranian capital .

As anyone who has ever paid into a lottery syndicate will know, the idea of pulling out and the group going on to win the jackpot is almost too cruel to bear. So spare a thought for Hazel Loveday, who left her work syndicate only six months before her bus driver colleagues won £38million in the EuroMillions Lottery draw. As the 12-man group worked out how to spend their £3,169,553 shares in the winnings, Miss Loveday, a ‘completely broke’ single mother, was left to rue the day she called a halt to her £2 a week contribution  because she couldn’t afford it. Crushing: Hazel Loveday, who left her work lottery syndicate just six months before colleagues won the £38million jackpot . 'I will not be returning': One of the EuroMillions syndicate winners, John Noakes, pictured with his wife Jean on his wedding day, is quitting as a bus driver . And to add insult to injury Miss Loveday, 36, discovered her bad luck from a hospital bed, after collapsing at work in an incident unrelated to the lottery news. Last night Miss Loveday, who earns £17,000 a year as a driver for Stagecoach and has a three-year-old son, was said to be ‘devastated’. Charles Connor, one of the winners, said: ‘We all feel sorry for Hazel but what can you do. You’ve got to be in it to win it.’ He added: ‘Hazel’s illness had nothing to do with our lottery win. She collapsed at work on Thursday – the day before the EuroMillions Lottery draw. I’m not sure what was wrong with her but she was rushed to hospital in an ambulance.’ Miss Loveday, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, had been one of the original dozen drivers to set up the lottery syndicate, and paid into it for three years. Fingers crossed! Ally Spence and his wife Yvonne reveal the secret behind their lottery success . Getting out of there: David Mead, pictured with his sister Sarah, told relatives he had resigned on the spot . She was the only member to pull out when organiser Chris Smith decided they should change tactics, altering their numbers and entering the Irish and EuroMillions lotteries. Her place went to another driver. The group represents almost a quarter of the 60 drivers working out of the Stagecoach depot in Corby, Northamptonshire. A friend told the Daily Mail: ‘Hazel is absolutely gutted, devastated. She is completely broke. That is why she had to give up playing the lottery and now she has lost out on a fortune because she could not afford to pay for the ticket.’ Meanwhile the syndicate members were last night whisked off to a luxury hotel in preparation for going public at a press conference this morning. Grand plans: Charles Gillion (left) was already set to retire this year, while Charles Connor (right) wants to go back to school to learn a language and aims to join a golf club . Mr Connor, 40, added: ‘One of the lads picked me up this morning and we headed to the hotel. The ticket holder was given the directions and the rest of us followed. ‘We were treated to a posh slap up meal. It was the full works. They even gave us caviar. ‘We are not going to turn all posh just because we won a bit of money, but it was quite overwhelming. ‘What I really want is a rest, I am knackered after this weekend. It has been surreal. I am a working class lad – I am not going to turn into some Lord Fauntleroy.’ John Drew, the depot’s manager, would only say: ‘The person who dropped out of the syndicate is currently in hospital.’ Dreams come true: Mr Noakes has a passion for Aston Martin cars... now he can afford his own . Leaving en masse: All 12 of the workers are based at the Stagecoach bus depot in Corby, Northamptonshire . Miss Loveday is now the only founding member of the syndicate left working for Stagecoach, after all the winning drivers quit their jobs. Winner John Noakes said: ‘It has been hard to leave work – a job I have been doing for years and years. But I had to – we all had to. ‘You cannot drive a bus packed with 70 people when your mind is on other things, it’s just not safe.’ Pugh's take on the lottery win . Mr Noakes had been a bus driver for 16 years, the last nine for Stagecoach. Yesterday Mr Noakes told how he would be buying his wife Jean ‘whatever she wanted’ – as well as swapping his Nissan Primera for an Aston Martin. The brother of winner David Mead, 54, said the  divorced father of four planned to ‘buy a new car and look after his family’. Other winning drivers have been named as Stephen Derrick, 53, Alexander Robertson, Christopher Smith, Ally Spence and Gary Symington. It is thought other drivers will have to be drafted in from surrounding areas to keep the service going. A Stagecoach spokesman said: ‘We have rejigged the driving schedules and colleagues of the winning drivers at Stagecoach Midlands have helped out.’ The bus drivers are the fifth UK winners in a row to scoop the pan-European jackpot. The syndicate’s number came up in the first line of their 24-line lottery ticket for Friday night’s draw. Each will receive £3,169,553. The winning numbers were 3, 4, 12, 23 and 50. The Lucky Stars were 4 and 7.","Hazel Loveday pulled out of the syndicate but was replaced by someone else .

A bomb exploded outside a Greek ministry responsible for axing 150,000 public sector jobs last night - apparently in protest at government spending cuts. Windows were smashed and desks were damaged in the blast outside the Public Sector Reform Ministry in Athens. The department are axeing 150,000 government posts by 2015 in an austerity drive. Blast: An explosion ripped through the ground floor of the Greek administrative reform ministry in the early hours of the morning . The explosion happened just a day after protesters marching in memory of a man who killed himself over financial woes that he blamed on the government. Demonstrators marched after a memorial . service for Dimitris Christoulas, 77, a retired pharmacist who shot . himself in the Greek capital's Syntagma Square. His death has further galvanized Greeks angry over their leaders' implementation of tough austerity measures that are aimed at bringing . the country out of its fiscal crisis. Police said the bomb outside the reform ministry last night was made up of at least five gas canisters. No one was injured in the explosion. Probe: Investigators look at the damaged building after a home-made firebomb exploded. No one was injured . A police spokesman said: 'There was . no warning call and the risk of someone being injured was big, as the . building is centrally located.' The . attack was the second in under a week. A similar bomb exploded at the . office of former Prime Minister Costas Simitis last Tuesday. Greece's coalition government, led by technocrat Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, denounced that attack as an attempt to destabilise the country ahead of national elections expected on May 6. Clash: Workers from the Athens central groceries market confront riot police on Good Friday outside the Bank of Greece in some of the latest skirmishes in the Greek capital . As the country struggles with . austerity, insurers have claimed that hard-up superyacht owners across . Europe are torching vessels they can no longer afford and want to get . rid of. Madeira has been dubbed the 'Greece of the Atlantic' - because it has debts 50 per cent higher per person than the rest of Portugal. The island, with a population of 250,000, owes €6bn (£5bn) as a result of over-development. A drive to turn the island into a rival to the Canary Islands has failed - and now the inhabitants are counting the cost. Portugal has been forced to negotiate a €78bn (£64bn) IMF bailout. The European Union alone spent £2.9bn on the island before the financial crisis started as money is poured into redevelopment on an island that was still a dictatorship until 1974. The island has been ruled by President Alberto Joao Jardin since 1978 - and he secured another four-year term last October. He has overseen a huge programme of public sector spending and infrastructure building. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Madeira was very poor before, and the only way forward was increasing the public debt. 'If I hadn't done that, we'd still be saddled with the rest of Portugal's debts today anyway.' Lloyds of London said they have faced an increase in insurance claims for yachts worth more than £1.6million. A number of those claims have come from the port of Piraeus. Loss adjusters Charles Taylor said they had seen 14 'suspicious' super yacht insurance claims in the last six months. Director Nick Smith told the Telegraph: 'Yacht insurance fraud is a common problem in any country when bad times arrive. 'It happened to a significant degree in Britain from 2009 as yacht owners, lumbered with marine mortgages they could no longer afford, tried to get rid of them and make insurance claims.' As Greece tackle their deficit, the Spain's economic minister said they should consider making rich people pay for their universal health coverage in an attempt to get public finances under control. The ruling party quickly dismissed the suggestion - and said Luis de Guindos was only expressing his own opinion. The centre-right government is desperate for ways to save money or increase revenue as it struggles to achieve tough deficit-reduction goals. International investors are increasingly shying away from buying Spanish debt - pushing up the country's borrowing costs. There are growing fears that Spain could be next in line for a bailout - after Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

Former Labour MP Margaret Moran is a 'broken woman' and mentally unfit to plead to charges of falsely claiming £80,000 in expenses, a court ruled yesterday. The 56-year-old is at times suicidal and has tried to harm herself since the allegations of defrauding the taxpayer ended her political career, doctors said. She was also said to feel 'abandoned' by the Labour Party. The judge ruled Moran was too 'mentally fragile' to appear in court, meaning that the case will be heard in her absence by a jury later this year. Showing the strain: An aged Margaret Moran cried as she left court last year after hearing charges regarding her expenses. Right, the ex-MP  at Westminster during better times . The former MP for Luton South faces 15 charges of false accounting and six other counts of submitting forged invoices. Moran is accused of repeatedly . 'flipping' her designated second home to allow her to claim . Parliamentary expenses for work to properties in London, Luton and . Southampton over four years. She is alleged to have claimed £22,500 . to treat dry rot at a home in Southampton, more than 100 miles from her . constituency. The home was originally owned solely by her then fiancé . and now husband, Michael Booker. Moran, who stood down at the last . election, is also said to have dishonestly claimed £4,756 for kitchen . units and £14,805 for emergency boiler repairs and work on a . conservatory. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph . told yesterday's hearing she should not take part in court proceedings . because she was suffering from a depressive illness, extreme anxiety and . agitation. He told Lewes Crown Court in East . Sussex that she would find a trial stressful, saying: 'She has feelings . of abandonment from the Labour Party. It remains a concern she may . commit suicide. Bear in mind she has attempted to harm herself.' Allegations: Margaret Moran is accused of 'flipping' around her home address, including to this one in Luton, to make improvements at the taxpayers' expense . Dr Joseph said Moran's mental problems . affected her ability to concentrate and remember events, and became . 'most severe' when she discussed the case. Asked if Moran might be . exaggerating her 'catastrophic reaction' he said it was unlikely. Three . psychiatric reports were commissioned and all agreed she was not fit to . plead. Dr Joseph said Moran felt she was . 'being punished for past mistakes [and] for incidents in her childhood . and adolescence' but did not explain further. He told the court: 'When she was an MP . she was an exuberant personality. When that was taken away, she looked . physically crushed and hunched.' He added: 'Everything she used to . bolster her self-esteem in her adult life has come crashing down and . that feeling of public shame and vilification was causing her to become a . broken woman.' Moran did not have to attend yesterday's hearing. The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, said . Moran had told a psychiatrist, 'I just want to plead guilty and be . punished', but said she was unlikely to have given the allegations . 'proper consideration'. He adjourned the case to Southwark Crown Court in London for a three-day hearing with a jury in November. Moran is the fifth Labour MP to face . prosecution over the expenses scandal. David Chaytor, Eric Illsley, . Elliot Morley and Jim Devine were all jailed, as were Tory peers Lord .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:18 EST, 3 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:48 EST, 3 May 2012 . Blind Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng today appealed to be granted asylum in the U.S. - and begged to be allowed to leave with his family on Hillary Clinton's plane. He said he feared for their lives should they remain in China, despite assurances they would be allowed to 'live free', and pleaded for a lift when the U.S. Secretary of State leaves after two days of strategic talks tomorrow. The self-taught lawyer's plea has thrown into doubt the agreement used to coax him out of hiding from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing - and fanned U.S.-China tensions at a sensitive time. Scroll down for video... Plea: Chen Guangcheng (left) wants to leave on U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's (right) plane . Tricky: The diplomatic row could now have come at a worse time for Hillary Clinton (left), who is in China for two days of strategic talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao (right) The stand-off appears particularly troublesome for the Obama administration, with Chen saying he now fears for his and his family's safety if he stays in China, as was planned under the deal that Washington called a good outcome for the dissident. China's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on Chen's request to leave the country and repeated its criticism of the way the United States had handled the issue as 'unacceptable'. Chen, a self-taught legal activist, left the U.S. Embassy yesterday and is now under Chinese control in a Beijing hospital. He had taken refuge at the U.S. mission for six days after escaping house arrest and left after U.S. officials assured him Beijing had promised to improve his circumstances. But Chen said yesterday by telephone from hospital, where he was escorted by U.S. officials and was being treated for a broken foot, that he had changed his mind after speaking to his wife who spoke of recent threats made against his family. He said: 'I feel very unsafe. My rights and safety cannot be assured here.' His family, who were with him at the hospital, backed his decision to try to reach America, he added. Free: Chen Guangcheng has left the U.S. embassy 'of his own volition' and was taken to Chaoyang hospital in Beijing . Talks: Hillary Clinton (left) and Chinese President Hu Jintao (right) during the first day of the conference . And he told thedailybeast.com: 'My fervent hope is that it would be possible for me and my family to leave for the U.S. on Hillary Clinton's plane. 'I hope to seek medical treatment in the U.S. with my family, and then I want to rest. As for the future, we’ll deal with that in the future.' A Republican congressman has accused Barack Obama's administration of trying to sweep concerns over Chen Guangcheng 'off the table' for 'happy' diplomatic photos. Chris Smith, for New Jersey, told FoxNews.com he has not spoken to Chen, who reportedly has asked for his help in leaving China. But he said the U.S. should 'without a doubt' revisit his case and consider granting him asylum, as conflicting reports emerge about the safety of him and his family. Smith said: 'There is no safe place in China if you’re a dissident. It doesn’t exist. It’s an oxymoron. I think we missed an opportunity to press for asylum.' The activist, citing descriptions from his wife, Yuan Weijing, said his family had been surrounded by Chinese officials who menaced them and filled the family home. Chen, from a village in rural Shandong province, has two children. He said: 'When I was inside the American Embassy, I didn't have my family, and so I didn't understand some things. After I was able to meet them, my ideas changed.' A senior U.S. official later said the United States was seeking to clarify Chen's wishes and continued to discuss his fate with the Chinese government. The official said: 'When we feel that we have a clear view of what his final decision is, we will do what we can to help him achieve that.' The timing of the Chen case comes at a fragile time for both nations. U.S. President Barack Obama will be . sensitive to any criticism of the handling of Chen in the run-up to a . November presidential election. China is struggling to push through its own leadership change late this year. That . carefully choreographed transition has already been wrong-footed by the . downfall of ambitious senior Communist Party official Bo Xilai after he . was caught up in a scandal linked to the apparent murder of British . businessman Neil Heywood. Free: Chen Guangcheng's departure from the embassy came shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Beijing for two days of annual strategic talks . Harassed: Mr Chen (right) says that he and his family have been abused while under house arrest . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton found herself in the eye of the diplomatic storm today, turning up for the opening of annual bilateral talks in Beijing which have been overshadowed, but not derailed, by the Chen case. She used the occasion to urge China to protect human rights but made no specific mention of Chen, whom she had spoken to yesterday after he left the embassy. He reportedly told her 'I want to kiss you', as he thanked her for America's support in brokering the initial deal. 'Of course, as part of our dialogue, the United States raises the importance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,' Clinton said. Family: Mr Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, was supposedly beaten by government guards and their daughter, Kesi, was harassed . Human rights: Mr Chen (right) met with the wife of a different human rights activist earlier this month while in his home, and he supposedly planned the escape for weeks by pretending he was sick . 'We believe all governments have to answer our citizens' aspirations for dignity and the rule of law and that no nation can or should deny those rights.' Despite Chen's change of heart about staying in China, it was unclear if he would be able to travel to the United States. U.S. officials appeared no longer to be with him today, with the dissident saying he had still not had an opportunity to explain his change of heart to the U.S. side. 'I hope the U.S. will help me leave immediately. I want to go there for medical treatment,' Chen said from the hospital, where a pack of camera crews and reporters was waiting outside, kept away from the entrance by police. Washington had hoped its deal with Beijing over Chen would defuse the crisis, with both Clinton and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in the Chinese capital for this week's talks - in which the United States will aim to secure more cooperation from China on trade and international flashpoints such as North Korea, Iran and Syria. Under the deal, according to U.S. officials, Chen and his family would have been relocated within the country in safety and he would have been allowed to pursue his studies. Proud: While Chen was in Beijing, his widowed mother and six-year-old daughter were believed to have remained under house arrest in Dongshigu village in Shandong province . Still in custody: Mr Chen escaped on his own and is calling for an investigation into the treatment of his family . But Chinese authorities have taken a tough tone, criticising what they called U.S. meddling and demanding an apology for the way U.S. diplomats handled the case. Chinese President Hu Jintao made no mention of the Chen case in his remarks to the U.S.-China talks but stressed that the two nations needed trust. 'It is impossible for China and the United States to see eye-to-eye on every issue, but both sides must know how to respect each other,' he said. Earlier, in comments aired on CNN, Chen said: 'I would like to say to President Obama, please do everything you can to get our family out.' Chen, 40, is a legal activist who campaigned against forced abortions under China's 'one-child' policy. He escaped 19 months of house arrest, during which he and his family faced beatings and threats, late last month. U.S. officials had said Chen left the embassy of his own free will because he wanted to be reunited with his wife and children. They said he wanted to remain in China and never asked for asylum. Chen's dramatic escape from house arrest and his flight last week to the U.S. Embassy have made him a symbol of resistance to China's shackles on dissent. The deal struck by Beijing and Washington would have kept him an international test case of how tight or loose those restrictions remain. Now, however, his change of mind throws not only his own future into doubt, but also raises questions about the wider U.S.-China relationship. It could also prove politically costly for Obama, who has already been accused of being soft on China by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and who could now face further criticism over Chen's case. What initially appeared to be a foreign policy success for the Obama administration could quickly turn into a liability.","Threats to his family were real reason behind his return to authorities .

Roger and Joyce Bunn went through 12 months of inspections and interviews to ensure that they met the strict criteria required to look after children. But the couple, from Hexham in Northumberland, have now been told that they have to go through the entire process again. Frustrated: Joyce and Roger Bunn's application to become foster parents was rejected because their social worker's handwriting was illegible . When the social worker assigned to their case by Northumberland County Council went on long-term sick, she passed her findings on to a colleague. However, the notes were so badly written they were illegible and the Bunns now have to restart their efforts to become foster parents. More...

Mrs Bunn, 54, said: 'After all the work we put in and all the hours we put in,it’s very upsetting. 'We worked so hard to make sure we fitted the bill and all of that feels wasted. “I have had tears and I have got really upset but now that I have calmed down I want to highlight what has happened. 'If it has happened to us, who knows how many more it has happened to? 'We don’t want anyone else to go through what we have.' Hexham MP Guy Opperman has taken up the case to campaign on their behalf and it could lead to a change in law concerning fostering. The Bunns began their year long application in September 2010 after responding to the Government’s plea for more carers to come forward. With two grown-up sons, Roger and Stuart and three grandchildren, the couple were confident they would be accepted as foster carers. Mrs Bunn, 54, said: 'We were thinking the child could be here before Christmas but they just keep fobbing us off. 'Just thinking about how we are with the grandchildren and other children, we know we are capable of doing this. 'We weren’t doing it for the money, but for love. 'We can give somebody something they haven’t got but that all seems wasted now. 'The programme was intense and if we weren’t being visited we were doing paperwork. 'They wanted to know everything about us, from the day we were born, to be told we have to do it all again is just so frustrating. 'But there are times when I look at it and think we could do it again because we really want to foster, but it is so time consuming and we agreed it would be too much to redo.' Frustrating: Joyce and Roger Bunn are not sure whether to re-submit their application to become foster parents . Mr Opperman has contacted the minister in charge of children and young people, Tim Loughton, who has subsequently asked for a review of the fostering system. 'I have the greatest degree of sympathy for the efforts and disappointment of Mr and Mrs Bunn,' Mr Opperman said. 'We are determined that what has befallen them won’t happen again. 'I would certainly support, and I am actively campaigning for an improvement in this system so we can have a fostering system which is not so dysfunctional as in this particular example.' A message on the county council's website says it is urgently seeking long-term foster parents for children aged seven or above. At present, the council has 146 foster parents but a spokesman confirmed it is on the lookout for 25 more. The spokesman added: 'We have apologised to Mr and Mrs Bunn for this unforeseeable delay and we are sorry for any upset caused. 'We have since reviewed our processes and taken measures to address and avoid future delays. 'Should Mr and Mrs Bunn wish to submit another application we would welcome it and we have assured them that we will deal with their application expeditiously.'","Roger and Joyce Bunn left frustrated by their experience .

A decanter box that belonged to the Duke of Wellington and may have been used during the Battle of Waterloo has been uncovered on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow. The old mahogany box was bought by Edgerton Falconer at an auction in the late 19th century but remained locked for 75 years because he did not have a key for it. It was not until his grandson, David Falconer, inherited the box that the lock was prised open with a screwdriver and a cheque signed by Wellington found inside, along with 10 glass wine and brandy decanters. Piece of history: Henrietta Wilson shows the decanter box owned by the Duke of Wellington to a delighted Clive Stewart-Lockhart on the Antiques Roadshow . Valuable item: The cheque signed by Wellington is worth the equivalent of £100,000 today and could have been used to buy the silence of a mistress . Mr Falconer's daughter, Henrietta Wilson, showed the box to antiques specialist Clive Stewart-Lockhart at an event for the TV show in Chichester, West Sussex. Mr Stewart-Lockhart speculated that the £195 - equivalent to £100,000 today - may have been intended to buy the silence of one of Wellington’s . mistresses. 'He had a number of mistresses over the . years, including one called Harriet Wilson who threatened to write her . memoirs and he said ""publish and damned"", said Mr Stewart-Lockhart. He added: 'Is this £100,000 to pay off someone like Harriet?' The Coutts . Bank cheque was dated March 1823 - eight . years after the Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. Experts believe the discovery of the cheque is evidence the box once belonged . to the British war hero. Fascinating: Intrigued specialists believe the box of beautiful decanters could have been in the duke's camp at Waterloo . Years ago banks used to send cheques back to their owners once they had been processed. Arthur Wellesley was the first Duke of Wellington and one of the leading military and political figures of the 19th century. He is often referred to as 'the Duke of Wellington' though there have been several since. Heroic Wellington took part in 60 battles during his military career, including commanding the allied army that defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. He was twice prime minister under the Tory party and oversaw the passage of the Catholic Relief Act 1829. He was one of the leading figures in the House of Lords until his retirement and remained Commander-in-Chief of the British Army until his death. Mr Stewart-Lockhart added: 'There is another thing that happened in . 1823 - his son bought a commission in the army. 'Was it to buy his son’s . commission? It’s still an awful lot of money.' It has been described as a 'campaign decanter set' and specialists believe it may well have been in Wellington’s private camp at Waterloo in Belgium. Mr Stewart-Lockhart added: 'It is a campaign decanter case so did the Duke take it on his campaign? In which case, was it at Waterloo?' Mrs Wilson, 42, from Hampshire, said her great-grandfather bought the set at a London auctioneers in the late 19th century. He bequeathed it to his son John, a lawyer, who in turn left it to his schoolteacher son David - Mrs Wilson’s late father. She said: 'The set had been locked ever since my great-grandfather bought it and it was just used as a piece of furniture by my family. 'Then in about 1965 my father became very curious about what was inside this box. 'He tried several keys and it wouldn’t open and against all his best principles he used a screwdriver to ease the lock. 'There was small amount of damage to the wood and lock. 'He . found the bottles and then this piece of paper fell to the floor and he . picked it up and saw it was the Duke of Wellington cheque. 'Since then we have always called it the Wellington chest and we like the romance and the ""what ifs"" about it. 'We don’t believe it would be right to sell it.' Priceless: The box was bought at auction by Mrs Wilson's great-grandfather and she said her family like the 'romance' of it . Bested: Napoleon Bonaparte had superior numbers . The return of Napoleon from exile induced allied leaders to prepare to attack France. Wellington, . with an army based in Brussels, was in contact with the Prussian . commander Blücher to his east, but Napoleon seized an early advantage, . beating the Prussians at Ligny on June 16. Although . Wellington held off the French at Quatre Bras the same day, he had to . fall back to the low ridge of Mont St Jean, south of Brussels. Blücher agreed to join him on the ridge, and Napoleon's subordinate Marshal Grouchy failed to block his advance. On June 18, Napoleon, with 72,000 men, waited for the ground to firm up and attacked late. Though . there were moments when the French came close to winning - Wellington's . 68,000 men, many sheltered from fire by the ridge, were still holding on . when the Prussians arrived. While . Wellington could never have won without 'the best of all instruments, . British infantry', Dutch and Hanoverian troops made a vital . contribution, and his plan depended on Blücher keeping his word.

Teachers yesterday threatened strikes on a new front – in defence of ‘essential’ six-week  summer holidays. They vowed to resist attempts to introduce four-week holidays, insisting longer breaks were needed to counter ‘excessive’ workloads. Both Prime Minister David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove have signalled support for a shorter summer holiday and longer school day. School's out? National or local proposals to cut the six-week summer break will be opposed by the NUT (File picture) Nottingham has become the first local authority in the country to propose switching all its schools from a traditional three-term calendar to five terms, with a four-week summer break. But members of the National Union of Teachers branded the plans ‘scandalous’ and approved campaigns – including walkouts – to halt them. The union, with nearly 300,000 active members, has already used its annual Easter conference to back industrial action over pay, pensions, academies, free schools, Ofsted inspections and a new reading test for five-year-olds. Most strike resolutions were passed with little or no opposition, fuelling claims that hardline Trotskyists are growing in influence over the country’s biggest classroom union. Delegates heard from self-styled ‘revolutionary socialists’ demanding ‘mass resistance on the streets’ to overthrow a so-called Coalition ‘dictatorship’. Militants pressed the union’s leadership for a national strike to be staged on May 10 over cuts to pensions, despite claims it would disrupt preparations for national tests the week after. In the latest debate, delegates also backed ‘campaigns, up to and including national ballots for both non-strike sanctions and strike action’ to fight ‘excessive workload’. These workload concerns include plans in some areas to reorganise the school year, the conference was told. NUT members in Nottingham have already staged a one-day strike over the plans, with two more due later this month. Walk out: Teachers in Nottingham staged a one-day protest recently as proposals for a cut to the school summer holiday were raised (File picture) Sheena Wheatley, secretary of the NUT’s Nottingham branch, claimed the five-term year proposals ‘represent a major attack on our conditions of service’. Critics of the current school year say a shorter summer holiday would boost standards. But delegates at the NUT’s annual conference in Torquay dismissed the claims. Tom Unterrainer, president of the NUT’s Nottingham branch, said: . ‘We’ve looked for rigorous academic research which points to the fact that learning loss takes place. There is none.’ NUT members passed a resolution saying that ‘demands on teachers are so high during term-time that the longer summer break is an essential factor in a teacher’s management of excessive workload and work stress’. John Illingworth, former national president of the NUT, said: ‘If this goes ahead, we in Nottingham will have the shortest school summer break in the world, at just over four weeks. ‘It’s true that South Korea have only five weeks, and a much longer working day. They also have the highest child suicide rate in the world.’ But a Department for Education spokesman said: ‘The fact is we have inherited a school year designed for children in the 1900s not the 21st century, so it’s right that heads are seizing the initiative and changing it.'","Slashing the summer break could damage teachers' wellbeing and children's learning, the NUT claims .

A beauty queen known as the real Penelope Pitstop is shaking up the high-octane world of drag racing with her bright pink super-charged drag car. Piston head Jayne Kay, 18, from Bury, Greater Manchester, competed to be Miss England but now hopes to become the only woman in Britain to hit 330mph on four wheels. And while most teenagers are lucky to get a normal driving licence and buy a modest-engined small car, Jayne can drive a 2000 horse-power dragster, capable of 0-100mph in a staggering 1.09secs - consistently hitting 200 mph. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE HER RACING . Determined: The 18-year-old has been racing for years and hopes to be the only woman in Britain to compete at the top level - where dragsters hit at least 300 mph . Miss Kay's pride and joy is her own bright-pink 200mph race car, aptly called Pink Lady, adding a touch of glamour to what is primarily a male-dominated sport. 'My dad Gary was a car champion in 1993, the . year I was born. He then took me down to the track to watch when I was . three or four and I was hooked,' she told MailOnline. When asked if she is the real-life . Penelope Pitstop, she said: 'I suppose. My pink car stands out and it . means that people know it is a girl driving. Iconic: Teenage drag racer Jayne Kay, with her Pink Lady car, is a proud beauty queen as well as an outstanding sportswoman .

'I absolutely disagree that being a . beauty contestant and a drag racer don't match. Nobody should be judged . just by their looks and I have proved myself in the sport. Drag racing is . aggressive but I have shown I can still do it my own way.' But as if piloting a 200mph car was not enough for her, she decided to enter the Miss England competition in 2011 after securing sponsorship from Santa Pod Raceway in Northamptonshire.

I'm very proud of representing my sport there because most had never heard of it because it is male dominated. 'In my racing class there are two other women and in the top class, where they go 300 mph, there are none.

Dangerous wood-eating termites that can destroy trees and damage homes are the latest infestation to turn up in Florida. The Nasutitermes corniger termite are native to the Caribbean but have now joined the 20 or so other species of termites which live in the Sunshine State. The pesky insects are the latest unusual species found in Southern Florida along with African rats, Burmese pythons, and poisonous caterpillars. Not welcome: The Nasutitermes corniger termite, which is native to the Caribbean, have been found in southern Florida. They feast on hard wood and build tunnels up the outside of houses . The arrival of the termite poses a particular problem because they feast on hardwood, foraging on trees, garden furniture and attack the outside wall of homes. The termites differ from Florida's other species because they are found above ground and can fly - making it easier for them to establish new nests. As well as milllions of termites, Florida boasts a menagerie of animals you'd be best to avoid: . The so-called Sunshine state has four types of poisonous caterpillars whose sting can cause humans to pass out in pain. Beware the saddleback caterpillar, the puss caterpillar, the io caterpillar and the hag caterpillar. Southern Florida's crocodiles, which grow up to 14 feet, have multiplied 10-fold in the last 40 years. There are about 1,500 of the reptiles. A growing population of Burmese pythons are threatening to wipe out large numbers of raccoons, opossums and other small mammals in the Everglades area. Huge Gambian pouch rats, which grow up to nine pounds, have been found on Florida's Grassy Key despite efforts to eradicate them. Boa constrictors, Nile monitor lizards, and vervet monkeys have also wreaked havoc on local animal species. They build tunnels running up the outside of houses and trees where they create beach ball sized nests weighing up to 28 kilograms. And a single nest could hold more than a million termites, Rudolf H. Scheffrahn, professor of entomology at the University of Florida, told the Sun Sentinel. 'They love to eat hardwoods. They ate the handles off garden implements, rakes and hoes — turned them into shredded wheat. If this thing really keeps going, it's going to be a problem for tropical Florida, from West Palm Beach to the Keys,' warned Scheffrahn. He worries that the new species could increase the amount of termites in the Dania Beach region by as much as 30 per cent. But agricultural officials are determined to stamp out the plague of termites before they spread any further. Currently the species have only been spotted in 42 properties in Dania Beach. However, this translates to an infestation of up to 120 colonies meaning there are already 100 million in the area. Properties in Dania Beach were treated today in a bid to banish the insects although efforts to eradicate them will be spread over four days. 'They got into the tool shed and ate our stack of firewood,' resident Martha Rosen told the Sun Sentinel. 'We went to pick it up and there was no wood left. They're very aggressive. My trees look like they're almost dead,' she added. 'Out-of-control hysterical': The io caterpillar is one of four types of venomous caterpillars to release toxins with the slightest touch that can cause people to pass out from pain . 'On fire': A saddleback caterpilalr (pictured) has been known to bring the worst pain of the four kinds of stinging caterpillars in Florida that is like having a 'bee sting times a hundred' Last month venomous caterpillars that use their spines to attack were the latest threat to the region. Dr Jeffrey Bernstein, medical director of the Florida Poison Information Center in Miami, told the Sun-Sentinel newspaper that although the center has not seen any deaths from caterpillar stings, they have gotten hundreds of calls for help with people 'out-of-control hysterical.' 'It's a very painful sting,' Dr Bernstein told the newspaper. 'We even see people pass out from the pain.' The four types of caterpillars with the awful venom include the saddleback caterpillar, the puss caterpillar, the io caterpillar and the hag caterpillar. When they attack humans, the venom can be unbearable, particularly if the saddleback releases its poison. South Florida resident Michael Stanwyck told the Sun-Sentinel: It's like somebody lit you on fire.' He went on to say: 'A bee sting times a hundred.' The species is most threatening around this time of year in Florida as the weather starts to get warmer. Eggs begin to hatch and the caterpillars grow to become moths. Some people, although rare, can have an allergic reaction to the toxins. and are encouraged to call 911 or go to hospital. They can experience vomiting, shortness of breath and other reactions. Others with less severe attacks can be treated at home by calling Poison Control. Scotch tape can be placed over the wounded area and stripped off over and over again to remove the spines from within the skin. Although their poison is painful, the caterpillars are not looking to harm anyone or anything. Jaret Daniels, assistant professor of entomology at the University of Florida, told the Sun-Sentinel that they are merely trying to protect themselves. The venom is used as the caterpillars' predators, like birds and lizards. Mr Daniels said: If you're a caterpillar, you have a very challenging life because everything wants to eat you. 'They're not trying to hurt you. They're doing it to avoid being eaten.' Florida has become a popular new . home for interesting creatures, including crocodiles that can grow up to 14 feet long. Protection: The hag caterpilalr is also poisonous as it tries to protect itself from birds, lizards and other attackers that can eat them and prevent them from becoming a moth . Coexist: Officials urge people to leave the venomous species, like the puss caterpillar, alone as they are not trying to hurt people with their poison that could provoke an allergic reaction to humans . The reptiles have multiplied 10-fold in the last 40 years in south Florida with about 1,500 crocodiles. But now they face a new challenge in the area because most of the places they used to call home are now inhabited by humans. Humans in Florida also have to worry about huge pythons that are wiping . out the state's mammal populations. A . burgeoning population of Burmese . pythons — many of them pets that were turned loose by their owners when . they got too big — appears to be wiping out large numbers of raccoons, . opossums, bobcats and other mammals in the Everglades, according to a . study from the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences. Here to stay?: Once crocodiles decide on a place to live, it's difficult to get them to move meaning people in Florida might have to get used to having the species listed as 'threatened' by wildlife officials . The . study found that sightings of medium-size mammals are down . dramatically — as much as 99 percent, in some cases — in areas where . pythons and other large, non-native constrictor snakes are known to be . lurking. Scientists fear . the pythons could disrupt the food chain and upset the Everglades' environmental balance in ways difficult to predict. Another species that has threatened the state's environment are giant Gambian pouch rats that have . been found on Florida's Grassy Key despite concerted efforts . by conservation officials to eradicate them. Officials . worry that the voracious rats, which grow to nine pounds, might wipe . out some crops and upset the delicate ecological balance if they manage . to reach the Florida mainland. Another creature: Crocodiles aren't the only ones taking over in Florida as burmese pythons invaded the area . The Gambian rat first appeared on Grassy Key in 1999 after eight rats escaped from a local exotic pets breeder. 'We . thought we had them whipped as of 2009,' Scott Hardin, exotic-species . coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, told . keysnet.com. 'In . the early part of 2011, a resident e-mailed me and said he saw one of . the rats. We were skeptical but went back and talked to people and [saw] . there were rats that we missed,' he added. Animals love Florida: African rats the size of cats have also taken up the warm state as their new home . Concern: Officials worry that the voracious rats, which grow to nine pounds, might wipe out some crops and upset the delicate ecological balance . After four female rats were found in . 2011, officials unsuccessfully launched another effort to kill them in November and . December, primarily through the use of poison-laced cantaloupe and . peanut butter. And it might become difficult to control crocodiles' interaction with humans if that population continues to grow. Crocodiles tend to stick to an area they decided they will live in now matter how much they have moved. So even if they leave a particular spot they chose as their own for weeks and travel far away, they are likely to return. They will likely continue to be one of the many species like boa constrictors, Nile monitor lizards, . vervet monkeys and more to join the state - and wreak havoc on local animal species.","A new species of wood-eating termite, native to the Caribbean, has arrived in Florida ."

And now there is even more good news for the creative youngster, after an impressed arcade owner has offered him real arcade games worth thousands of dollars. Scroll down for video . Entrepreneur: Caine Monroy built a cardboard arcade in his father's auto parts store and hundreds of people flocked to see it. Now he has been offered a real arcade game worth thousands . When a video of the home-made arcade went viral, it was seen by the owner of an L.A. pinball shop, who then invited Caine to her store and meet professional pinballers, TMZ reported. Caine visited Pins and Needles - a pinball and tailoring shop - on Wednesday evening and played on a real pinball machine for the first time in his life, the website added. The store's owner, Molly Atkinson, was reportedly so impressed with the boy that she offered him one of several pinball machines, which cost as much as $3,000, for free.

U.S. authorities say they remain concerned over a possible ‘lone wolf’ attack on the one-year anniversary of Osama bin Laden’s death. While there are no concrete threats in retaliation for the Al-Qaeda leader’s death on May 1 last year, the Department of Homeland Security warns against possible solo attacks against the country and its citizens. These attacks are often carried out in the name of a terrorist organisation, but are committed by only one person. On alert: The Feds issued a warning over a possible 'lone wolf' attack on the upcoming anniversary of bin Laden's death (file photo) Patrolling: The Homeland Defence Secretary warned last week that a terrorist could target a train or subway, like those in New York (file photo) In a bulletin issued late Wednesday night, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued warnings of possible retaliations from Al-Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban, as well as Somalian terrorist group Al-Shabaab. Osama bin Laden was killed during a Navy SEALs raid on May 1, 2011 . All three have called for revenge in the May 1, 2011 death of bin Laden. All three terrorist networks would consider an attack on the anniversary of bin Laden’s death a ‘symbolic victory,’ FoxNews.com reported. The bulletin also detailed terrorists’ fixations with launching attacks on symbolic dates. In testimony given earlier this week, a British man who trained to be a shoe bomber a decade ago said bin Laden told him after the September 11 terrorist attacks that he hoped more attacks would follow. Speaking at Harvard University last week, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano reinforced the need for vigilance, saying: ‘We’re on guard against dangerous individuals or groups who would use violence, often on behalf of a grievance. ‘We’re on guard against dangerous individuals or groups who would use employment to gain access to public places like airports, malls, and train stations, or sensitive infrastructure like water treatment, chemical, or energy plants.’ She also warned of possible cyberspace threats, but did not elaborate on any known plots.The anniversary of bin Laden's killing presents an election-year challenge for President Obama and his Republican opponents. Mr Obama is expected to acknowledge the May 1 anniversary of the daring Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden's Pakistan compound. But he will not overdo it, a senior White House official said, reflecting perhaps the dangers of hyping an event that speaks for itself - and is still controversial, particularly among Pakistanis who saw the U.S. attack as a violation of their country's sovereignty. Looking on: President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and members of the national security team receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room May 1 . Republicans, especially presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, must decide if the occasion is an opportunity to attack Mr Obama's foreign policy record - or talk about something else. National security has not been a major theme in a 2012 campaign dominated by economic worries, but that could change - at least temporarily - in the days ahead. On Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden will use a New York speech to contrast Mr Obama's foreign policy record with what the president's partisans see as Romney's inexperienced rhetoric. Mr Biden will inevitably recall bin Laden's demise and other successes against al Qaeda over the last three years. In a hastily called speech from the White House on May 1, Obama said U.S. special forces had killed bin Laden in his compound near Islamabad. The United States had not informed the Pakistani government before launching the raid, which took place before dawn local time on May 2. The killing of bin Laden, who was behind the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, sent Americans into the street in late-night celebrations and revived the image of a country that would find its enemies - even if it took a decade. Then: Mr Obama listened to updates during the Navy SEALs raid in Pakistan . For Mr Obama, 'this is a moment to be presidential and not worry so much about the campaign,' Clyde Wilcox, a professor of government at Georgetown University, told Reuters. 'The emphasis is that America will avenge itself, and we do take action when we are attacked. Not to be gloating, but to be strong.' A senior White House official said that in addressing the anniversary, Obama 'will give credit where credit is due,' in a nod to the work done by the administration of Republican President George W. Bush to track bin Laden down, as well as the U.S. forces who carried out the mission. Bin Laden's killing in a compound just a few hours drive from Islamabad was a severe embarrassment to Pakistan, worsening relations with Washington and fanning anti-American sentiment in the country. Analysts acknowledged the anniversary had an unavoidable resonance on the U.S. campaign trail, but cautioned that glorifying bin Laden's killing may not serve American interests in Arab and Islamic countries. 'It's a difficult minefield given Pakistani sensitivities and continued questions about al Qaeda's Pakistani support network,' said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst who has advised Obama on counter-terrorism issues.","Feds warned of possible 'lone wolf' attack in bulletin released Wednesday .

Wants flow of money: Former Welsh Water boss John Elfed Jones says Wales should be making a profit from supplying water to England . Drought-hit England should be made to pay for using water from Wales, the former head of Welsh Water claimed today. As millions of English households are slapped with hosepipe bans, John Elfed Jones argues that water is a business and, like oil, should be sold to make money. His comments came as Severn Trent, which supplies mid Wales, announced plans to sell water to Anglian Water without at cost price. But speaking to Welsh-language programme Taro Naw, broadcast on S4C last night, Mr Jones said: 'Is it fair Wales isn't profiting a penny from the water which is exported to England? 'In 50 years, will our people look back and ask why didn't we invest years ago? 'It's about time we took this option seriously. 'It's a lack of energy and vision which leads us to be in difficulties often.' Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru say that powers over Wales' natural resources should be devolved to politicians in Cardiff Bay. A current hosepipe ban affects 20 million people in England who get their water from seven companies. They are: Thames Water, Southern Water, South East Water, Anglian Water, Sutton and East Surrey, Veolia Central and Veolia South East. Sign of the times: Marston reservoir in Hertfordshire (above) highlights how low water levels are in much of England . The ban has sparked debate over whether transferring water from regions, such as upland areas of Wales, should be carried out. Severn Trent has since announced plans were being drawn up to supply more than 100,000 homes in the worst-hit areas. It aims to sell 30 million litres of water a day to Anglian Water, one of the seven companies that imposed a hosepipe ban at the beginning of April to help ease the shortage.",John Elfed Jones says Wales should profit from trade .

The Asparagus season faces ruin this year after the wettest April on record has led to a national shortage. Growers usually start cutting the green spears by the end of last month but so far, hardly any have appeared. Prices of the popular Spring vegetables have rocketed from £6 to £10 per kilo in supermarkets, where it has been flying off the shelves in recent years due to TV cookery programmes. In demand: The growing popularity of Asparagus is being offset by a shortage after the April showers reduced crop levels . The weather has also lead to the cancellation of this weekend’s traditional British Asparagus Festival in Evesham, Worcestershire, where many growing fields have been flooded this week. The asparagus season only lasts around seven weeks from May 1 to June 21, and there are fears the whole £20million British crop of around 5,000 tons, could be a write-off if the weather does not improve soon. Andy Allen, the chairman of the Asparagus Growers’ Association, said the wet weather has resulted in a cold soil when the vegetable needs warm, dry dirt to flourish. He said: ‘Things are really very . desperate. We had two very heavy frosts in April followed by an awful . lot of rain and that has cooled the soil right down. ‘Asparagus . requires warm and dry soil in April in order to grow and it just hasn’t . grown. It is the same picture across the UK. There is virtually nothing . out there.’ 500,000 tonnes of Asparagus are grown every year . 150 growers in Britain . In 2010, the retail crop was valued at £18.2m . 6m tonnes are produced by China each year - more than any other nation . There are also concerns for this month's annual Chelsea Flower Show as the cold and sodden weather may lead to fungal diseases in the ground. Many designers have had to quickly rethink and redesign previous plans in an attempt to avoid what some are saying may be the dullest displays. Tim Rumball, editor of Amateur Gardening magazine, said 'The rain has certainly been a relief from the drought but without warmer temperatures and wind the ground becomes waterlogged which encourages fungal diseases. 'If this sort of weather carries on it will be very challenging for designers at Chelsea. 'But many plants are grown undercover and in carefully controlled conditions so they should be fine.' Mr Rumball also advised householders to aeriate their lawns with forks to bring life into them. He said: 'The laws are just muddy and people need to get a big fork and jump up and down on it a lot. 'The . drought in the late winter would have slowed growth and weakened roots. The rain has then drowned the roots and prevented access to air so . drainage is essential. 'It . is more than likely that the grass is growing poorly and is not likely . to get too long but that will not be the case for everyone.' The Asparagus Festival in Evesham has been cancelled this year because of the downpour . Meanwhile, a major knock-on effect . near-constant rain has seen the number of people visiting garden centres . to buy plants and products needed. Some businesses have reported a 25 per cent loss in trade compared to April 2011. However, . it was not all bad news for garden centres. B&Q reported a 49 per . cent rise in sales of waterbutts and a 145 per cent increase in demand . for wellington boots for April. Martin Stewart, owner of Stewarts Garden Centres based in Christchurch, Dorset, said their profits were down by 25 per cent. There have also been concerns for the Chelsea Flower Show over the torrential downpour in April . He said: 'Last year's April was a mix of sun and rain but we had the Royal Wedding bank holiday and an early May bank holiday which helped. 'This year people just haven't been gardening because of the weather. It hasn't just been wet is has also remained very cold for this time of year. 'Even the most keenest of gardeners has struggled to get outside for much of April. 'The months of April and May should be one of the busiest times of the year in the garden. 'A lot of seeds and bulbs are planted and people start thinking about bedding plants for their hanging baskets and containers. 'And they generally go to garden centres to buy not only these items but also compost and fertiliser and pots and baskets. 'But if they put these plants in the ground over the last week or so they would probably have drowned.' A spokesman for the Golden Acres Garden Centre in Bournemouth, added: 'People are just not gardening. 'If they plant anything, heavy rain and hail will just ruin the plants. Being as wet as it has been is causing chaos, people cannot get in the garden. 'They are less inclined to hang baskets. It is too expensive to heat greenhouses and almost impossible to care for seedlings.'","Fears escalating that the entire British crop valued at £20m could be written off .

Miss Hartridge, 34, rushed Tiddy to the vet but the cat died hours later from ‘horrific internal injuries’, the court heard. Tiddy was one of eight cats owned by Miss Hartridge, and the favourite of her daughter Tallulah. The attack happened only days before the little girl’s second birthday. Witness Laura Lucardini, 72, told the court: ‘I saw the postman bashing the lid down and realised he was smashing it on to the cat who was meowing loudly, screeching.’ She said Vincent then took the cat from his mail trolley and casually threw it over the hedge. Another witness, June Dye-Hodge Beardsley, ran out and confronted the postman before dialling 999. In an emergency services recording played to the court,  Vincent was clearly heard swearing at both women. Robert Borwick, prosecuting, said Miss Hartridge had been searching for her pet when Vincent’s delivery manager, who had received a report about the incident, arrived in a van and helped her find Tiddy. Vincent, a postman of nine years,  was . sacked after the attack in Windsor in March last year. The  case also . resulted in the end of his relationship with his partner.

'Steven drinks OJ' alluded to acquitted murderer OJ Simpson . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:58 EST, 8 March 2012 . Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry showed jurors notes in a bid to prove he had already decided to kill of the character of Edie Britt, played by Nicollette Sheridan, before an incident which saw him 'tap' her on the head. But while the veteran producer has claimed he made the creative decision in May 2008, a former writer on the show contradicted his testimony as she told the court today that it was not until December of that year that she heard the actress's role was being terminated. Lori Kirkland Baker was a writer on the show's fourth and fifth seasons, but her contract was not renewed after that. Confident: Nicollette Sheridan arrived at the courthouse looking upbeat in yet another beautiful suit today . It came after Cherry showed the jury . his writers' notes detailing various scenarios for killing off . Nicollette Sheridan's character in the months before he and the actress . argued on the set. She contends it was a 'wallop,' which led to her being axed from the show after she raised concerns about this mistreatment. But Cherry produced coded notes that he . says prove he couldn't have killed off her role in retaliation as they . outline early plans for her exit and pre-date the incident. The notes were made by writers while . crafting plots for the show's fifth season, during which Sheridan's . character, Edie Britt, died. In one early example, Cherry told . jurors the code 'Steven drinks OJ' was a reference to Sheridan's . on-screen husband killing Britt. He said it was a reference to O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted of killing his wife. She wears it well: Sheridan has a different couture suit for her each day, the actress certainly knows how to work a stage . Proof: Marc Cherry was also cheery as he arrived at court today carrying the notes he says prove that he considered many exit strategies, including an OJ Simpson-style murder plot . Inspiration: Cherry said that one scenario was inspired by acquitted murderer O.J, Simpson and the death of his wife Nicole Brown in 1994 . Cherry also explained how Sheridan's exit was because she put a negative atmosphere on the set and argued with Teri Hatcher. The producer said Sheridan told him that Hatcher was the 'meanest woman in the world' Sheridan is suing Cherry and ABC, . claiming she was fired from Housewives after complaining that Cherry hit . her during the September 2008 argument. She is seeking more than $6 million. Cherry and a former ABC executive, . Mark Pedowitz, have testified that approval to kill off Sheridan's role . was given four months before the fight. Pedowitz testified yesterday that he thought Britt's character had run its course by the fifth season. 'They were relieved': Marc Cherry has said that Eva Longoria and Felicity Huffman were happy to learn Sheridan was getting axed from the show . Happier business: Desperate Housewives star received her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today - with husband William H.Macy - and was supported by co-stars Vanessa Williams and Marcia Cross . Cherry told jurors that he had . contemplated killing Sheridan's character at the end of season three, . but studio and network executives didn't approve it. As he began to plan season five in May . 2008, he said he wanted to kill Britt as part of a 'risky but . potentially effective change to the series.' He received approval to kill Sheridan's role on May 22, 2008, from two top-ranking executives at ABC. Sheridan's attorneys have claimed . Cherry decided to fire Sheridan from the series only after he was . cleared by ABC executives for striking the actress on set. More details to come: Sheridan's attorneys have called Cherry as . the trial's second witness, and he is adamant that he did not axe her in retaliation for any complaint . In opening statements, the actress' attorney, Mark Baute, claimed the episode in which Britt dies was poorly . written and was done more haphazardly than if it had been planned for . months. Cherry said he never wavered in his . decision to kill off Sheridan's role, but that he acquiesced to requests . by the executives to wait until later in the season for the on-screen . killing to occur. The notes displayed Wednesday showed . Britt's death was originally slated for mid-season, with several . episodes dealing with a police investigation. He said the coded phrase 'Steve drinks . OJ' was necessary to keep the secret from people passing through the . writers' room where Housewives scripts are contemplated and crafted. Scene ofthe showdown: Sheridan and Cherry are battling it out at the Los Angeles Superior Court . 'Mine is a series based on surprise and shock and secrets,' Cherry said. Britt died in the 18th episode of the . season after surviving a strangulation attempt and a car crash, only to . be electrocuted by a downed power line. Baute, in opening statements, called it a triple homicide that reflected Cherry's animosity toward Sheridan. Existing cast members Felicity . Huffman, Marcia Cross and Eva Longoria are expected to take the stand in . the coming days, they're completing their final season after starring . in the vehicle since its smash hit inception in 2004. Battle: Sheridan . took to the stand on Friday and claimed that Cherry deliberately didn't . give her character any funny lines . Giving evidence: Court papers show the names of stars from Desperate Housewives who will be called for the defense . Written out: Sheridan's character Edie Britt was killed off in 2009 when her character was electrocuted following a car crash . No research: Potential jurors were told not to watch Desperate . Housewives at the end of day two in the Nicollette Sheridan versus Marc . Cherry legal battle . They're more likely to be found around an achingly trendy pool, or being fitted with impractical shoes on Rodeo Drive... but Nicollette and Lindsay Lohan have become pioneers of an unlikely legal chic trend. And while they may not have wanted to appear in court in the first place, 25-year-old Lindsay perhaps more vehemently than Nicollette, they'll be damned if they don't use the opportunity as a showcase. L.A law: Lindsay Lohan and Nicollette both bring the same kind of platinum blonde starlet glamour to their appearances at court in California . And so they should, both starlets found themselves in the drama keg that is a courtroom at a time when their careers were nothing short of moribund. It's given Lohan's career CPR, being reprimanded so publicly while she pouts like the starlet the world never knew it wanted until now, and it could revive Sheridan's prospects if she plays her cards right. Whatever happens, both platinum blondes have looked spectacular in tailored clothes and vertiginous pumps that never veered towards stripper territory. These unfortunate sets of circumstances have given two great actresses, who lost their way for various reasons, a chance to shine again... albeit on an unlikely stage.","Lori Kirkland Baker learned of plans to axe character seven months after Cherry claims to have made decision .

A police watchdog will investigate whether allegations of corruption in the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation were not passed on to a major inquiry. Scotland Yard said it called in the Independent Police Complaints Commission today after reviewing 'a considerable number of files and reports dating back to the 1980s'. The review was sparked amid claims that a confidential report compiled by the force’s anti-corruption command was not disclosed to the panel of the 1998 Macpherson inquiry that examined the force’s handling of the case. There are claims that a confidential report compiled by Scotland Yard's anti-corruption command was not disclosed to the panel of the 1998 Macpherson inquiry that examined the forces handling of the Stephen Lawrence case . The force refused to disclose again if two months of searches by its own detectives had uncovered any evidence that reports had not been passed on to Macpherson. A force statement said: 'The Directorate of Professional Standards has reviewed a considerable number of files and reports dating back to the 1980s as well as conducting interviews with a number of key individuals involved in the original investigation into both Stephen Lawrence’s murder and police corruption. 'We have retrieved a number of key documents, which greatly assist in understanding what material was available to the Macpherson inquiry and are now in the process of sharing our findings with the Independent Police Complaints Commission so that they can review it in the light of their previous involvement in the case.' Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed twice after he was attacked by a gang of racist white youths in Eltham, South London in 1993 . The announcement comes after the teenager’s mother, Doreen Lawrence, called for the reopening of the major public inquiry into the circumstances of his death. Documents were said to focus on the conduct and integrity of former Metropolitan Police commander Ray Adams, who was involved in the probe into the murder. Despite investigating the claims for more than a month, Scotland Yard has been unable to confirm if the potentially crucial files were passed to the inquiry, headed by Sir William Macpherson. Home Secretary Theresa May has since offered to meet Mrs Lawrence, who said the claims gave further impetus to her calls for a public inquiry. Some of the allegations against Mr Adams centred on his relationship with Kenneth Noye, who was later convicted of a separate murder. No criminal or misconduct charges were brought as a result of the internal investigation into Mr Adams, who says he was exonerated and denies any wrongdoing. He was questioned at the Macpherson inquiry about corruption, but no evidence of wrongdoing was found. During the Macpherson inquiry, lawyers claimed Noye had a criminal associate, Clifford Norris, whose son David was a prime suspect in the murder of Stephen.

David Norris and Gary Dobson were convicted of Stephen’s murder in January this year - 19 years after the crime - and sentenced to life at the Old Bailey. It has also been claimed that another Scotland Yard officer, who interviewed the suspects following Stephen’s killing, had links to Clifford Norris. Former detective sergeant John Davidson denies any wrongdoing. The Metropolitan Police statement came as Mrs Lawrence joined a vigil with the family of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teenager who was shot dead in Florida two months ago by a Neighbourhood Watch volunteer.

Social services and other agencies 'poorly managed' the care of a 10-year-old boy who hanged himself in his bedroom, a report has concluded. Harry Hucknall, a cousin of Simply Red singer Mick Hucknall, was 'a sad, lonely and extremely anxious child' but there was no evidence his situation was 'demonstrably improved' by the authorities. The youngster was discovered in his locked room at his home in Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria on September 19 2010. Harry Hucknall, left, a cousin of Simply Red singer Mick Hucknall, . right, was described as 'a sad, lonely and extremely anxious child' in . the report . He was a twice-removed cousin on his father’s side of Hucknall, the frontman for the 1990s chart-toppers. Last March an inquest heard how Harry was diagnosed with clinical depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and was prescribed an anti-depressant, and a psychostimulant drug. He had attempted self-harm and was also the victim of bullying. A serious case review by the Cumbria Local Safeguarding Children Board was ordered following his death. Harry, referred to as Child F in the review published today, was first referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) by his GP in 2007 having been found with a plastic bag on his head and reported to have said that he wanted to die. He was not seen for psychiatric assessment and instead was offered a programme of undirected play therapy, despite fears being voiced by his mother, the report said. The youngster was referred back to CAHMS in early 2010 having again been found with a bag over his head and having stated he wanted to end his life. Harry, pictured when he was younger, was referred to mental health authorities in early 2010 having again been found with a bag over his head and having stated he wanted to end his life . He was seen by a child psychiatrist who diagnosed a major depressive disorder and at the same time was also referred to children’s services by his school. He was then the subject of regular multi-agency involvement up to the point of his death. The independent report said: 'The panel was of the view that Child F’s case was generally poorly managed by the key agencies. There was evidence of poor practice throughout, which included both single agency failings and generally poor inter-agency communication and collaborative working. 'Practice was considered to be largely adult rather than child-focused and there was no evidence of Child F’s voice being heard or his wishes and feelings taken into account by professionals working with him and his family.' The report added Harry was 'extremely vulnerable' and felt 'unloved and unwanted', caused by 'his parents’ inability or unwillingness to recognise his needs and put them before their own'. Harry was discovered in his locked room at his home in Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria (town centre pictured) on September 19 2010 . He was in need of therapy and protection from his parents but neither was recognised or met, despite him being known to a number of agencies. The report concluded: 'It was the view of the panel that no single agency was responsible for failing to protect Child F from the chronic emotional abuse and neglect that he suffered. 'It felt, however, that the failure of CAMHS to identify Child F as a likely high risk of suicide at the second presentation in 2010, produce an accurate formulation of risk and take the lead in developing a multi-agency risk management plan was a fundamental omission which impacted significantly on the responses of other agencies to Child F’s difficulties.' Last year West Cumbria Coroner Ian Smith ruled out suicide and, in a narrative verdict, said Harry died as a consequence of his own actions without understanding the true consequences. The inquest heard that it was . difficult to say how the drugs affected Harry’s state of mind but their . influence could not be excluded. The levels of both drugs found in his . system were above the normal therapeutic level for adults. Mr . Smith said he did not criticise their prescription in Harry’s . circumstances, nor did he argue that the drugs should not be used by . children. But he pointed out that doctors must be 'extremely careful' in . prescribing powerful drugs to 10-year-olds. Addressing . the subject, the serious case review found: 'The issues in relation to . the use of such medication and the complexities involved in treating . co-morbidities remain unresolved. This is clearly a national issue and . central government guidance is needed to inform and direct future . medical practice.' In a statement, Cumbria Local Safeguarding Children Board said all agencies involved 'deeply regret that this tragic event happened'. It continued; 'The report makes a number of different recommendations for how we should all improve our practice. Many of these relate to issues around how agencies assess the needs of children and in particular how they respond to evidence of self-harm or threats of suicide in children. 'We believe the key lessons which are common to all agencies are: the child must always be at the centre of our work and should be asked directly about their care and their feelings; we should always take threats of suicide seriously - this applies not just to agencies and professionals, but to families and communities; multiple medications to children should be carefully prescribed and monitored. 'Full and comprehensive action plans have been produced in line with the recommendations of the review. Cumbria Local Safeguarding Children Board will be overseeing progress on these plans, and holding the agencies to account for completing them. 'Many of the actions have been implemented, and the remainder are well on their way to completion. The changes made will improve the quality of services provided to children and families in Cumbria.'

The Los Angeles-based student is trying to decide whether to study astrophysics or physics for his second university degree. Precocious child: Moshe Kai Cavalin, pictured with his mother Suichen Chein, began reading college-level books aged two . Moshe's mother Suichen Chein said she realised . her son’s incredible abilities when he started reading . college-level books at age two. After completing his studies at East LA Community College aged 11, Moshe took up maths at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles). The family say his fellow students - who are nearly a decade older than Moshe - have been supportive of the 14-year-old. 'At first they were really curious, what . am I doing there?' Moshe told ABCNews.com. '[Then] they started being . like big brothers and big sisters.' He said he now prefers to spend time with his classmates rather . than children of his own age. Remarkable intellect: Moshe is also a published author, having written a book about his experiences called 'We Can Do' 'We talk about [life] and studies and all the . material in class,' he said. But in spite of his early . accomplishments, the precocious teenager says he does not want to be defined purely by . his intellect. 'Genius is just a word just like IQ is a number,' he said. 'It just classifies [them] at one point and . ignores everything else that makes the individual who they are.' His mother, who chaperones the youngster to class, said: 'He’s a happy kid and he’s learning so well. He’s doing a fantastic job by himself.' Moshe’s father Joseph said that he realised his son’s potential one afternoon as he picked him up from school. Early development: The young teenager says he now prefers spending time with his friends on campus than with children his own age . 'I saw him outside, he was tutoring the mother of another kid,'  said Mr Cavalin. 'It was fantastic, I almost cried that day.' Mr Cavalin decided his son needed to be put in advanced classes after his teachers said Moshe’s academic needs would disturb the other children. Moshe was enrolled at East LA Community College aged eight - but he insists he was not forced into advanced classes too young. 'Most people say that my parents pushed me,' he said. 'However, I think happiness in childhood is more importantly passed on [through] loving parents and a creative environment.'

The 58-year-old former Democratic presidential candidate is facing trial in North Carolina for allegedly abusing $1million of campaign finances. But Judge Catherine Eagles delayed the trial until at least March 26 and said he should avoid driving and travel - including to court proceedings. Delayed date: Former presidential candidate John Edwards, 58, is facing trial in North Carolina over allegedly abusing $1million of campaign finances . Edwards walked into the courtroom in . Greensboro without assistance and appeared healthy. Judge Eagles had . requested that he be there. His cardiologist wrote two letters to . Judge Eagles but no details were revealed about what sort of surgery or . what illness Edwards may have. ‘The public has an interest in a speedy trial, and this case has already been continued twice,’ Judge Eagles said on Friday. ‘Ordinarily, I would try to manage . something like this. But clearly there are some limitations on Mr . Edwards due to real and serious health issues.’ The National Enquirer claimed last . month he thought he was dying after a jog when his heart began pounding . and he struggled to breathe. Hidden: Mr Edwards's mistress Rielle Hunter, pictured with their daughter, 'received nearly $1 million from donors aiming to help hide her pregnancy' ‘John fell apart in front of a pal . after returning from a jog and was afraid he’d die,’ a source close to . him told the National Enquirer. ‘His heart began pounding and he was . having laboured breathing,’ the source added. ‘He had many symptoms of a . major heart attack.’ 'The public has an interest in a speedy trial, and this case has already been continued twice.

Florida polo millionaire John Goodman, convicted of DUI manslaughter earlier this month, has reached a settlement of $46 million with the family of the 23-year-old victim who died in the crash. Goodman, 48, faces up to 30 years in prison after being convicted of drunk-driving manslaughter and leaving the scene of a crash that left Scott Wilson dead in February 2010. The huge payout relates to lawsuits brought against the tycoon by the victim's parents’, Lili and William Wilson, and comes before Goodman’s sentencing on April 30. Polo tycoon: John Goodman has reached a settlement of $46 million with Lili and William Wilson - whose son, Scott, died after Goodman crashed into his car . Justice: Lili Wilson leaves the courtroom after the guilty verdict was read out - she and her husband have reached a settlement with Goodman . The Wilson’s attorney, Christian Searcy, confirmed the . figure to the Palm Beach Post and said that $6 million of the amount would be paid by The . Player’s Club – the bar where Goodman was drinking before the crash. The settlement comes after Goodman, . the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida, . adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins . last October, entitling her to up to a third of his biological . children's trust fund, worth $300million. Scott Wilson was only 23 years old when he was killed in the car crash . At the time the Wilson’s lawyers slammed the move as an attempt by Goodman to shield his assets. The revelation of the $46 million pay . out also comes after last week’s news that Goodman’s lawyers had filed a . motion for a new trial based on alleged jury misconduct. The motion was made after an . alternate juror called Goodman’s lawyers claiming that it was ‘clear’ to . her that the other jurors had decided the defendant was guilty before . the trial was over. Prosecutors successfully claimed that . Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into . Wilson's car two years ago, causing it to roll into a canal. The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes. Goodman left the scene and waited an . hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery . as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene. After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit. At trial Goodman said he was sure of . one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the . crash, yet he was not drunk and that he drunk after the crash to . alleviate his pain. After leaving a bar, he said his car . suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my . brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used . to,' he said. Impact: The crumpled car driven by Wilson, left, and the Bentley driven by Goodman, right. Goodman said he drank from a bottle of liquor he found after the crash - the reason he was over the limit . Deadly: Wilson family members look at the Bentley Goodman was driving when he ran a stop sign in 2010 . Unable to control the vehicle, it . slammed into the side of Scott's - even though Goodman said he was not . aware he had hit another driver so left the scene. If he had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help', he claimed. Goodman then went to a nearby barn where he found a bottle of liquor, the Miami Herald reported. 'I ... drank it to alleviate, . thinking it would help with my pain,' he said, claiming it was the . reason his blood alcohol content was more than double the legal driving . level when his blood was taken three hours after the crash. Goodman’s lawyers are now hoping for a . new trial or for the conviction to be overturned after an alternate . juror came forward saying the jury had broken pledges they made to the court. Grieving: Lili Wilson, the victim's mother, wept when Goodman's 911 call was played in court last month . Bill: The court is shown Goodman's receipt for drinks, allegedly bought for himself and others before the crash . The defense claims that the jurors . ignored the court’s orders by discussing evidence before the end of the . case, making derogatory remarks about Goodman’s wealth, and by reading . media coverage of the case. The motion detailed how an alternate . juror reported the alleged misconduct to the court but when she did not . hear back she called Goodman’s lawyers. She told them that the jury of five . men and one woman discussed the case among themselves ‘throughout the . trial’ despite being told they shouldn’t. Newest family member: Goodman, right, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last fall. The move means she is entitled to up to a third of his biological children's $300 million trust fund . 'We all had things to say about the . trial as it progressed each day,' the juror said in an affidavit. 'On . one occasion I reminded the jury that we had been instructed by the . court not to discuss the case until the end. In reply, I was teased by . being asked by another juror if I had a crush on Mr. Goodman.' The juror also claimed that members of the jury often mentioned Goodman’s wealth' 'Based on the negative talk about Mr. Goodman's wealth and the issues discussed about the case, it was clear . to me that these jurors had already made up their minds before Thursday, . March 22,' the juror stated in her affidavit. Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club, which Goodman founded, attracts A-list celebrities . Home sweet home: Goodman sold his mansion in Wellington, Florida to his children's trust for $3.8million and now pays $2,000 in rent each month . The motion details that one juror . started writing a book about the case while the trial was still ongoing . and that jurors made ‘false statements’ to cover up another’s . ‘prejudicial gesture.’ The juror who spoke to Goodman’s . lawyers claimed that one of the jurors was keen to finish the case by . Friday March 23 because they had a weekend boating trip planned. Wilson was a University of Central . Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer at the time of the . crash. He had been driving home to Wellington to visit his family when . Goodman ran a stop sign.","Polo mogul John Goodman reached settlement with victim's parents'

Lord Justice Leveson (above) stressed that the possibility the second part of the inquiry may not go ahead has not affected his approach to the first part . Lord Justice Leveson  yesterday hinted he may ditch the second part of his inquiry into the Press, which was due to look specifically at News of the World phone hacking. He said waiting for the conclusion of any potential criminal  trials meant it would be ‘very many months, if not longer’ before his inquiry could begin. He suggested consideration should be given to the value of his investigation, which he said would involve ‘enormous cost’ to the taxpayer and would simply ‘trawl over’ previously heard material. Although he did not rule out pressing ahead as planned, Lord Justice Leveson said it was ‘in everyone’s interests’ to allow the first part of his inquiry to go ‘as far as it possibly can’ in case the second part is abandoned. When the Prime Minister announced the inquiry, at the height of the controversy over phone hacking in 2011, he said Lord Justice Leveson should conduct his investigation in two parts. The first was to examine the ‘culture, practices and ethics’ of the media, including contacts and relationships between the Press, politicians and police, and make recommendations for a new regulatory regime. Rupert Murdoch at the Leveson Inquiry last week. When David Cameron commissioned the probe in the wake of revelations about phone-hacking at the News of the World in July 2011, he gave Lord Justice Leveson a remit to carry out an inquiry in two parts . The second was to investigate the . ‘extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International, other . newspaper organisations and, as appropriate, other organisations within . the media’. Labour MP Chris Bryant, whose phone was hacked, told BBC Radio 4's World At One: 'All I ever wanted... was an inquiry into what went on at the News of the World' It would also look at allegations of . corrupt payments to police and allegations that the police failed to . respond properly to the initial phone hacking allegations. Last night Chris Hutchings, a lawyer . acting for some of the hacking victims, said: ‘It would seem very likely . that, in the course of the ongoing criminal proceedings, much of the . evidence as to unlawful or improper conduct at News International will . be addressed and findings made. In those circumstances, it would make at . least aspects of any part two redundant.’ The board of News Corporation  last . night dismissed claims by members of the Commons culture, media and . sport committee that Rupert Murdoch is ‘not fit’ to run his global media . empire. Their unanimous vote of confidence . came as Labour and the Liberal Democrats piled pressure on broadcasting . regulator Ofcom to speed up a report on whether Mr Murdoch is a ‘fit and . proper person’ to control Sky TV.

The Barefoot Bandit smiled in court as he was sentenced to seven years in jail today after pleading guilty to an amazing two-year crime spree of burglary and theft across nine states in the U.S. Colton Harris-Moore, 20, of Camano Island, Washington, who gained notoriety for his crimes and a 20th Century Fox film deal to help repay his victims, looked down and smiled as the court case came to end. He was captured by authorities in the Bahamas in a hail of bullets in July 2010 after crash-landing a stolen aircraft he had flown from Indiana. One big joke: Colton Harris-Moore, the Barefoot Bandit, grins after his sentencing today Island Superior Court in Coupeville, Washington . Taking it lightly: The Bandit smiles along with his attorney John Henry Browne at his sentencing . 'Cya!': Chalk drawings of bare feet are shown on the floor of a store on Orcas Island, Washington, after the store was allegedly broken into by Harris-Moore . Friday's proceedings consolidated cases . against Harris-Moore in three Washington counties. He has already . pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be sentenced for . those crimes early next year. He will serve his state and federal . sentences at the same time. The high school dropout and self-taught pilot stayed a step ahead of the law as he broke into dozens of homes and stole cars, boats and planes. Harris-Moore, who will receive his first of two sentences on Friday, got his nickname for apparently committing crimes without shoes. Shoeless footprints, some outlined in chalk, were left behind at the scenes of a number of his crimes - such as in Orcas Island (see photos). Prosecutors will ask for a nine-and-a-half year sentence, while his lawyers John Browne and Emma Scanlan are seeking a six-year term. ‘He was a menace,’ Greg Banks, prosecuting, said. ‘His burglaries threatened and distressed people.’ The money from his $1.3million film deal will be used to help pay money he owes in compensation to the victims of his long crime spree.

Then he broke into the homes of his classmates to steal food because his mother spent most of her Social Security income on beer and cigarettes. She has denied this. But over the next three years he was convicted of theft, burglary, malicious mischief and assault, among other crimes. In 2007, the boy was jailed for three years for burglary, but fled a minimum security juvenile facility in April 2008 and was soon up to more tricks. He hopscotched his way across the U.S., frequently crash-landing planes in rural areas and stealing vehicles from car parks at small airports.

Profile: In 2007, the boy was jailed for three years for burglary, but fled a minimum-security facility in April 2008 and was soon up to more tricks . Harris-Moore was eventually captured in the Bahamas last year but his escapades earned him cult status as an authority-mocking folk hero. The crimes began in late 2009. He allegedly flew a stolen plane from Anacortes, Washington, to the San Juan Islands nearby. He allegedly stole a pistol in British Columbia and took a plane from an Idaho hangar, where bare footprints were found on the floor and wall. That plane crashed near Granite Falls, Washington, after it ran out of fuel, prosecutors said. He made his way to Oregon in a 32ft boat stolen from Washington - stopping first to leave $100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Washington. From Oregon he travelled across the U.S. to the Bahamas, authorities said. In all, he was suspected of more than 100 crimes in nine states.

He has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be sentenced for those crimes early next year. Harris-Moore still faces up to six-and-a-half years in prison when he is sentenced then. But he will serve both sentences at the same time. His lawyers have cited his bleak childhood in a Camano Island trailer with an alcoholic mother and a series of her convict boyfriends.

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 14:13 EST, 3 February 2012 . Former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling, right,reviews documents with his attorney Bruce Hiler on Capitol Hill . Scandals such as Enron have cost investors billions - and revealed that current methods of defecting boardroom fraud are sorely lacking. Chief executives can't simply be subjected to lie detector tests during investor calls. Often, the only method for looking into their affairs is auditors manually looking through accounts. More often still, their dishonesty only comes to light afterwards. But researchers at Duke University and the University of Illinois believe there is another way - using a technique called Layered Voice Analysis to listen for the telltale sounds of CEOs lying. The researchers had an advantage: they . could listen back to earnings calls where it was revealed afterwards . that the CEO had been lying, and 'tune' their technique using convicted . fraudsters. The academics turned to an Israeli company called Nemesysco, and claim that they find 'vocal dissonance' in the CEOs speech at precisely the point when they were lying. If true, the discovery could revolutionise the world of finance, and have ramifications in many spheres of life. Nemecysco's technology is aimed at law enforcement and airport security, but the technique, which involves electronically analysing minute changes in people's voices to look for 'tells' that they are lying, could save billions in investor calls if it could pinpoint that a CEO isn't telling the truth. The researchers write, 'We find vocal dissonance markers from . the early part of the speech samples—the precise time when dissonance . should be most pronounced—are positively associated with four measures . of dissonance from misreporting.' 'This lends support for the LVA-based . cognitive dissonance measure. In an archival setting, we find that . cognitive dissonance in CEO speech can predict whether a firm’s . quarterly financial reports will be adversely restated at better than . chance levels' Nemesysco describe their technology as 'a set of vocal measurements, parameters and functions found through field studies of real life vocal data to correlate with key human emotions.' The researchers claim that the Layered Voice Analysis technique provides an automated way to scan for the distinctive sound of someone lying . The idea isn't new - Nemesysco products have been trialled in the UK to detect bogus social security claimants on the phone, but were withdrawn after public outcry. The technology has never been conclusively proven, but Nemecysco claims the algorithm is evolving. The academics say that they do not know precisely how the software works, 'LVA is an emerging technology and, as with most commercial products, its inner workings are proprietary,' they say. 'While our laboratory results suggest the LVA dissonance metrics capture aspects of cognitive dissonance, we are unable to document the mechanisms by which LVA is able to do so.'","Software scans voices for 'dissonance'

Just three of the 200 suspected war criminals found in Britain in the past 18 months have been removed from the country. Suspects identified by border officials are accused of systematic killing, torture and rape in countries such as Afghanistan, Rwanda and Zimbabwe. More than 30 have been given the right to stay here. Campaign groups said the figures showed Britain was a ‘safe haven’ for war criminals. Earlier this week the Daily Mail revealed that a former Serbian soldier accused of involvement in one of the worst atrocities of the Balkans war was allowed to stay in Britain because of his human rights. Milan Sarcevic is accused of  taking part in the 1991 Vukovar massacre when 300 wounded Croats were beaten, executed and buried in a mass grave. The 60-year-old – who denies any wrongdoing – came to Britain more than a decade ago and, when he was refused asylum, returned to Croatia in September 2002. But just eight months later he was allowed back in to Britain to put in another asylum claim. This year an immigration judge ruled that evidence of his involvement in the atrocity was ‘not conclusive’, and said Sarcevic must be allowed to stay because of his family rights under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. Last year it emerged that a former henchman of Robert Mugabe was given refuge in this country. UK border officials have identified 200 criminal war suspects accused of systematic killing, torture and rape in countries such as Afghanistan, Rwanda and Zimbabwe . Phillip Machemedze tortured political opponents of the Mugabe regime, but he was given the right to stay in Britain in case he faced ill-treatment when returned to Zimbabwe. Home Office figures, released under Freedom of Information rules, showed that more than 800 people were investigated between June 2010 and the end of last year over potential involvement in war crimes. Of those, further action was recommended against 207. But just three have been removed from the country. Another 32 have been told they can stay here – including 15 on human rights grounds – and two have been given British citizenship. The remainder are still under investigation, having their cases reviewed, appealing against a decision to remove them or awaiting removal having lost their case. The figures appear to suggest war crimes suspects see Britain as a potential home. Dr James Smith, chief executive of the Aegis Trust, which campaigns against genocide, said: ‘Aegis successfully campaigned for a change in law to allow the prosecution of genocide and war crimes suspects residing in the UK, but unless that law is applied, the UK will remain a safe haven for people responsible for the worst crimes known to humanity. ‘The question is, how many of the suspects identified by UK Border Agency have been fully investigated by the police and how many investigations are currently in progress?’ A Border Agency spokesman said: ‘The Government makes no apologies for refusing people access to the UK if their presence is not conducive to the public good. ‘We are determined to ensure the UK does not become a refuge for war criminals. If it is not possible to remove them immediately – for example, if we have been over-ruled by the courts – these individuals can now be subjected to stringent reporting and employment restrictions while we continue to seek their removal.’","Suspects are accused of killings, torture and rape .

The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) concluded in March that they should be made public – and this recommendation has now been formally accepted. The NSABB took a stand over the papers last year out of concerns that details of the studies - which induced mutations in the virus that made it transmissible among mammals by air rather than by close physical contact - could be used for bioterrorism. Green light: Papers on the H5N1 avian flu virus will be published in Nature and Science this year . However, in a statement . issued on Friday, the director of the National Institutes of Health, . Francis Collins, said: ‘This information has clear value to national and . international public health preparedness efforts and must be shared . with those who are poised to realize the benefits of this research.’ When the NSABB initially recommended . the two papers should not be published in full by the journals where . they were under consideration, Nature and Science, critics raised fears . that important science was being censored. The ensuing debate raised questions . about whether the research should have been done at all, as well as . whether current national and international rules on biosafety and . biosecurity are sufficient to protect the public from dangerous . microbes. The biosecurity panel spent two days earlier this year considering the papers. Deadly: The natural form of H5N1 has infected tens of millions of birds . Both papers describe how scientists . altered several genes of natural, or wild-type, H5N1 in a way that . allowed it to spread from the airways of infected ferrets to other . ferrets caged nearby. So far, the natural form of H5N1 has . infected tens of millions of ducks, geese, chickens, and other birds. But the only people to be infected - 598, of whom 353 have died - were . those who came into close contact with the flocks. The board was persuaded by an . additional benefit of publishing the research - by informing countries . where H5N1 is endemic, it would allow scientists there to be on the . lookout for the mutations that make the virus more transmissible. ‘We had new information, confidential . information, about benefits of this research, and we also had . confidential information about the risks involved,’ said Paul Keim of . Northern Arizona University, who is the acting chairman of the panel. ‘And the balance began to change.’ Ron Fouchier, who led one of the experiments, said the NSABB decision was ‘very much to our pleasure.’ Collins added: ‘The U.S. Government . aims to preserve the benefits of vitally important life sciences . research that holds the promise of enhancing quality of life for all of . us, while minimizing the possibility that the knowledge, information, . products, or technologies provided by such research could be misused for . harm.’",Recommendation from NSABB made in March formally accepted .

Rev Coles, who regularly visits extremist Hamza in Belmarsh said he would miss their chats in the high security prison. Their unlikely connection began when . Hamza moved into Finsbury Park Mosque in the late 1990s, which is on the . same street as St Thomas’ Anglican Church, where Rev Coles presides. Yesterday, Rev Coles said it is . unlikely he will ever see Hamza again - and worried he may struggle to . stay in touch when Hamza is sent to the United States for trial. He said: ‘He is someone with whom it . is possible to have a conversation. You might not agree about everything . but you can have a conversation with him. ‘It’s highly unlikely - if he is extradited fairly soon - that I shall ever see him again.’ ‘On one level I have a sense of slight . relief as I do not have to get myself into a high security prison which . is not a very nice experience. ‘On the other level I’m sad that the . conversations we have been having for the last twelve or eleven years . will come to an end. I don’t know how much it’ll be possible to keep . contact with him.’ In an interview with Premier Christian . Radio, Rev Coles said the men were ‘both pastors’ and that they were . able to discuss religious issues - even if they don’t always agree. He also raised questions about the . charges laid against Hamza, and said he was worried extraditing him to . the US will ‘build up more and more resentment’ in Britain.

February 2006 for inciting murder and race hatred. Since serving his . sentence he has remained in prison while fighting extradition to the US. But according to Rev Coles he has been ‘demonised’ and ‘turned into a monster’ by the media. The men first came into contact after . 9/11 when Hamza said of the attacks: ‘Many people will be happy, jumping . up and down at this moment.’ These comments were, Rev Coles said yesterday ‘rather outrageous’. But nonetheless he made contact because the men were ‘both pastors working practically next door to each other’. Hamza made him a cup of tea and, Rev Coles has said, ‘treated me like a normal human being’. After Hamza was arrested in 2004, Rev .

In the card he asked if Hamza would like to continue their conversations. Hamza wrote back he would ‘very much like to’. Since then Rev Coles has visited Hamza two or three times a year.

He also gave evidence in his defence. ‘We have had conversations about all manner of different things,’ he said. ‘I always ask him about his family. I ask him about his health and how he is being treated. ‘We discuss Christianity and Muslim things and what’s going on in Finsbury Park.’ ‘He is extremely well informed about what is happening in the world. I assume because he has access to television.’ He also worries about Hamza’s health . and the treatment he receives in Belmarsh which, he says does ‘not have . the facilities to deal with his health issues satisfactorily’. Hamza is blind in one eye and has no arms below the elbow after they were blown off in Afghanistan. Hamza was cleared for extradition to . the US yesterday by the European Court of Human Rights along with four . other terror suspects. A grand jury in New York has indicted . him on charges that he ran a terror training camp in Oregon in the late . 1990s and involvement in the kidnapping of 16 hostages in the Yemen in . 1998, during which four people died. Moving on: Hamza was cleared for extradition to the US yesterday by the European Court of Human Rights, pictured, along with four other terror suspects . The training camp charges are, Rev Coles said on the ‘wider edges of credibility’. ‘I never ever speak to him about that . business in the Yemen. We did speak about this so-called training camp . in Oregon which does seem to me to be on the wider edges of credibility. ‘Given that he is here, I know you can . organise all kinds of things on the internet these days. But organising . a training camp is quite a detailed thing that you have to do. ‘And he I think felt that somebody else had been telling stories about him to implicate him.’ He said Hamza expects to spend the rest of his days in prison, and is anxious about not seeing his family if he is found guilty. ‘I think a long time ago he got used to the idea that he will probably spend the rest of his life in prison,’ he said. ‘The possibility of any real contact . between him and his family from the moment he gets to the US - I mean . assuming he is found guilty - is very remote. When contacted by the Daily Mail, Rev Coles declined to comment further. Rev Coles is openly gay and entered into a civil partnership in 2006. He is also an open advocate of gay marriage.

Spurned Simon Clayton – who was the centre of an international manhunt after abducting his own daughter – subjected writer Adele Nozedar to an 18-month campaign of harassment. Magistrates heard how the 49-year-old set up a blog, posting comments about Ms Nozedar. And he ‘tagged’ her over 4,300 times in the rambling, online blog - where he sometimes posts as many as 18 entries a day. Harassed: Successful author Adele Nozedar, left, was subjected to months of torment after jilted lover Simon Clayton refused to accept their relationship was over . He also created fake Facebook profiles in her name, all of which was in breach of a given a restraining order in 2010 barring him from contacting. The pair had been in a two-month relationship but Clayton - who was jailed for abducting daughter Esti ahead of a custody battle in 2003 - refused to accept it was over. Ms Nozedar - author of books Freaky Dreams and The Secret Language of Books, and the former boss of a record label whose roster included dance acts Leftfield, Moby and S-Express - told told the court of the torment the episode has caused. In an impact statement, she said she had changed the route she drove to work and even closed down a business as a result of Clayton’s actions. Prosecutor Sian Vaughan told magistrates in Brecon, Powys: ‘Ms Nozedar had been made to feel upset and nervous in her everyday activities and had been afraid of bumping into the defendant. ‘She describes how she changed the route of her drive to work as it had passed the caravan where the defendant lives, which had given her a feeling of dread. Obsessed: Simon Clayton, pictured holding a dead hedgehog, posted one through his former lover's letter box . ‘He had an obsession with her and his was not the behaviour of a sane person. ‘He had mentioned her in his blog every day and she said he didn’t know why he hated her.’ He even publicised it by leaving comments on the Daily Express website, which had been serialising one of Ms Nozedar’s books. Clayton, from Llanigon, near Hay-on-Wye, Powys, denied two charges of harassment, but was found guilty at trial. Defending, Michael Davies said: ‘He fully recognises what he did and knows it was wrong and will not do it in the future.’ Magistrates imposed a new restraining order and gave Clayton a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work, and a costs order of £1,000. In an impact statement, Ms Nozedar said: ‘Some things are not meant to be and he can’t seem to accept that, and I hope something can be done to stop him posting such nasty, vicious things online.’ Clayton was given a nine-month prison sentence in 2003 for taking daughter Esti on an unauthorised holiday during an access visit.

Nick Clegg believes he and his fellow MPs should be forced to publish their tax returns - but suggested this new transparency should not be extended to his own highly-paid lawyer wife and other politicians' spouces. The Deputy Prime Minister said he would . be happy to publish his own ‘rather boring’ tax return to reassure . voters that he was subject to the same rules as everyone else. But he suggested his wife Miriam, a high-flying City lawyer and the director of a . Spanish building firm, who is likely to earn much more than the £134,565 her . husband earns, was off limits. Big earners: Nick Clegg with his wife Miriam, pictured flying the flag for her husband's party in a yellow dress last September, who is a top City lawyer. Mr Clegg said that only MPs themselves should publish tax returns . He was asked on ITV news if his wife would have to make her earnings public. Mr Clegg repolied: ‘The principle . needs to be a simple one – us politicians, as servants of the public – . should make our own arrangements transparent. 'But I don’t think we . should necessarily call on other people to do that.’ Mr Clegg's Spanish-born wife Miriam, who has kept her maiden name of Gonzalez Durantez, is a fiercely independent woman . Although her income is unknown, the mother-of-three has had a glittering career in the legal profession and is likely to earn a large six-figure salary. She is a partner of U.S. law firm Dechert, where she works as the Head of the EU Trade and EU Relations at their offices in the City of London. Handsome home: Nick Clegg and his wife live in this £1.5million Georgian property in Putney, south-west London . Before that she  spent six years working for legal giants DLA Piper. Since 2010, she has also been a non-executive director of Acciona, the Spanish renewable energy infrastructure projects and water management conglomerate. The couple live in a large detached Georgian house in Putney, south-west London, worth an estimated £1.5million. They also have use of two luxury houses on the Continent. His parents Nicholas Snr and Hermance own a 20-room chalet in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos Wolfgang and a chateau and a 10-room chateau in south-western France. Despite Tory warnings that the move would fuel the politics of ‘envy’, Mr Clegg suggested that all MPs should publish their tax returns as ‘a matter of principle’. His comments go much further than Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne who have suggested that any transparency drive would be limited to senior ministers. Speaking at an event in London’s . Canary Wharf, Mr Clegg said: ‘I have got no principle objection . to greater transparency by politicians of their tax return. Luxury: The 20-room Alpine chalet in Davos Wolfgang, Switzerland, owned by Nick Clegg's mother Hermance . Chateau Clegg: Nicholas Clegg Snr's 10-room mansion in south-western France . 'I . think you would probably find mine rather boring – I earned one salary . and paid tax on it, and that’s it. It’s a matter of public record . already.’ Ministers have . also come under pressure to say whether they benefited from the decision . in the Budget to reduce the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p for . those earning more than £150,000. The calls have intensified in recent . days following claims that Labour’s London mayoral candidate Ken . Livingstone channelled his earnings through a company to minimise his . tax bill. Mr Osborne . indicated last week that the Government was considering whether . ministers, including the Prime Minister, should be more transparent . about personal tax. The . move would be unprecedented for a sitting Prime Minister. Mr Cameron . believes that people seeking the ‘highest office’ should expect such . scrutiny. Yesterday he said he was ‘very relaxed’ about the idea, which . he said looked ‘increasingly likely’ to take place. Nick Clegg said that politicians are 'servants of the public, therefore the public has the right to know' about their tax returns . In a swipe at Vince Cable, the Prime Minister said he had never done anything that could be regarded as avoiding tax – unlike people who failed to pay VAT. The Liberal Democrat Business Secretary ran into trouble last year when it emerged he had been fined £500 for an outstanding £10,000 tax bill. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable ran into trouble last year when it emerged he had been fined for an outstanding £10,000 tax bill . Sources have previously suggested that any publication would be limited to the tax affairs of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne, Mr Clegg and Foreign Secretary William Hague. It is unclear how much detail, if any, will eventually be published. But tax expert Richard Murphy, of the campaign group Tax Research UK, yesterday warned that even full publication of ministers’ tax returns would give little idea of whether they were dodging tax. Mr Murphy said: ‘A great deal of tax avoidance isn’t seen on the tax return itself. One of the first objectives of the tax avoider is to make sure that their income is not theirs as far as the Revenue is concerned – they may move it into a company, or offshore. Just publishing the tax return won’t tell the whole story.’ And Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger . warned that publication of MPs’ tax affairs risked fuelling envy among . voters. And he urged ministers to focus instead on making public the tax . affairs of major corporations accused of avoiding millions in tax. Mr . Liddell-Grainger, chairman of the all-party group on tax, said: ‘The . problem is not me, or MPs – what is much more important is companies and . corporations and very wealthy individuals. ‘If you publish the tax returns of people willy-nilly across the UK then I think you will get the envy factor and jealousy.’ Mr Clegg’s comments came as he revealed that senior figures from all three main parties began talks yesterday on political funding following a string of scandals. He said: ‘Party funding scandals have blighted all parties – no party is purer than the driven snow.’ Publishing the tax returns of politicians would not necessarily give any idea of the scale of their assets, experts warned. Chancellor George Osborne, for example, is a beneficiary of  a trust that is reported to be worth £4million, which would not appear on his tax return. Ministers’ salaries, which are already in the public domain, would be on the tax return. They also give limited information  on the income received from  savings, shareholdings, property lettings and trusts. But the true scale of their wealth would remain secret. Because Mr Osborne currently receives no income from his trust, it would not be listed on his tax return. The offices of David Cameron and Nick Clegg said that neither of them are beneficiaries of trust funds. Senior ministers have come under pressure to provide more detail about their affairs following the decision to cut the top rate of tax for people earning more than £150,000. Mr Cameron is believed to pay the top rate, which was cut from 50p to 45p in the Budget, but  Mr Osborne has said he does not. Mr Clegg has also indicated that he is not a top earner. The Prime Minister does, however, receive thousands of pounds a year by renting out his Notting Hill home while living in grace-and-favour apartments in Downing Street. But he is allowed to offset it against a mortgage – making it hard to work out how much cash he receives. Accountant Richard Murphy, founder of the campaign group Tax Research UK, said that even  if the returns were published  in full they would not reveal whether politicians were using the numerous loopholes to avoid tax. He added: ‘It would tell us that some people have higher incomes than others and that some people have investments. But it will not tell us who is tax avoiding and who is not. ‘If someone is doing something they shouldn’t be they can get round it and it will never appear on a tax return.’","Declaration goes further than PM David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne's view that only senior politicians should publish details .

Family fears: Chen Guangcheng, left, talks with U.S. ambassador to China, Gary Locke as they leave the U.S. embassy for a hospital in Beijing . Blind Chinese lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, who escaped house arrest and now is expected to leave his country for the United States, is concerned his relatives are now paying for the price for his freedom. Authorities in his hometown have notched up restrictions on members of his extended family while he awaits permission in Beijing to travel abroad under an agreement between China and the U.S. Chen’s nephew is under investigation over the stabbing of village security agents who entered his home in search of the fugitive. His brother and sister-in-law have been placed under house arrest, and several other relatives face some form of restriction on their movements in their village in Shandong province, according to Chen, his lawyers and a rights group. Chen's flight from abusive house arrest in Shandong and into the protection of U.S. diplomats — which led to an agreement with Beijing to let him study in the U.S. accompanied by his wife and children — has exposed the impunity of local officials and embarrassed the central government. 'I feel that Shandong's retribution against me has already started,' Chen said in an interview Thursday from a hospital where he is being treated for injuries suffered during his dramatic escape from his guarded farm house. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Thursday the U.S. made inquiries with China and 'expressed our concern should there be any sense of reprisal.' Retribution concerns: Activist Chen Guangcheng, left, and his wife, Yuan Weijing, hold their son in Shandong province, China . On guard: Security staff stand guard at a gate of the Chaoyang Hospital - he is being treated for injuries suffered during his dramatic escape from his guarded farm house . The woman who drove blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng to Beijing after his dramatic escape from house arrest told how she sat with security officers afterwards to watch the jailbreak movie, The Shawshank Redemption. He Peirong said that five days after picking up Chen, she was taken from her home in Nanjing by state security officers 'to assist with investigations'. The officers interrogated her about whether she helped plan Chen's escape. 'They thought more than one hundred people were watching a blind man and they could let the blind man escape?' In an odd twist, He revealed The Shawshank Redemption was showing on television in the hotel room where three security officers questioned her and Guo Yushan, a Beijing-based researcher and rights activist. He Peirong said she had received a surprise email from a source which read: 'The bird has left the cage. What do we do?'   'I understand. I'm in Beijing,' He replied. She was in the capital, meeting friends. By midnight the next day she had driven for six hours by car and arrived at the outskirts of Linyi city in Shandong. She was accompanied by Guo, but declined to give details on how many other people were in the car. There was no predetermined pickup point in Shandong, according to He, and when she and the others arrived, they searched for him. When He picked Chen up after midnight, it was the first time she had met him. By that time, the combative, self-taught legal activist had scaled walls and made his way through fields and farmland without water or food for 17 hours, she said. In between, he had slept in pig pens and fields. He Peirong said she alerted US-based activists that they may need to seek help from the US State Department and members of Congress in Chen's case, and stayed in touch with them throughout. Chen's nephew, Chen Kegui, is . believed to have been detained in relation to a clash with officials who . reportedly broke into his home after the activist's escape in late . April. The nephew's . arrest notification allegedly says he is suspected of attempted . 'intentional homicide,' said Liu Weiguo, a lawyer who volunteered to . defend Kegui but has yet to see the notification document himself. Liu said at least one local Communist Party official was injured in the April 26 fight but no one died. Local . Shandong police in the city and county overseeing Chen's village said . they weren't aware of the situation with Chen's family. Communist Party . publicity officials could not be reached. Chen . has said a Chinese government official promised abuses he and his . family suffered from authorities in Shandong would be investigated, but . it is unclear if a probe has started. The authoritarian government is often . mindful of not undermining or alienating local officials on whom it . relies to enforce policies. Police in the activist's town are searching for the nephew's wife and have threatened to detain his mother, Chen Guangcheng said. 'I hope that this issue gets some attention and that lawyers are able to meet the family and have the case entrusted to them,' he said. 'They won't let the lawyers enter the village and won't let them interact with the family. In turn, they are taking revenge on my family like this. It is simply too outrageous.' The Chinese Human Rights Defenders . network said around a dozen of Chen's relatives in the village of . Dongshigu are under some form of house arrest. 'Even . when the international spotlight is on Chen, his extended family has . been cut off from communicating with the outside world, and his nephew . is in police custody,' said Wang Songlian, a researcher with the group. 'What is going to happen once the spotlight shifts? It is extremely worrying.' Escape: Villagers stand on the edge of Dongshigu village, where Chen Guangcheng escaped from house arrest, in Shandong province . Chen is expected to travel to the United States after China’s foreign . ministry said it would accept his bid to study abroad. He has been . offered fellowships at New York University and the University of . Washington. A self-taught legal activist, Chen . gained recognition for crusading for the disabled and fighting against . forced abortions in his rural community.

But doctors there failed to carry out vital tests on the toddler, instead dismissing his illness and advising his parents, Lucy and Raymond, to take their son home. A fourth, from a GP out-of-hours service, also failed to spot that Harry was seriously ill or refer him to hospital for treatment despite the fact the little boy appeared ‘lifeless’. Instead Harry died at home in his sleep, four days after he was first taken to hospital. A post-mortem examination revealed he died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after suffering from an inflammation of the colon, which had not been spotted. Coroner Anne Pember criticised doctors at Northampton General Hospital  and a GP’s out-of-hours service. Horrifying: Less than five days after his first trip to hospital, at 4am on May 1 Harry's father found him tragically dead in his bed . She said he could have survived had he . been re-admitted to hospital and given proper treatment. Last night . Harry’s parents, who have two older sons, said he had died needlessly . because of ‘sub-standard’ care. Mrs Connolly, 29, said: ‘I kept . telling the medical staff that Harry was extremely sick but nobody would . listen. Three opportunities to save my son were wasted.’ A two-day inquest in Northampton was told Harry fell ill at his home in the town on April 23 last year. Mrs Connolly, an administrative . assistant, took him to his GP three days later and, on the doctor’s . advice, he was admitted to NGH later that evening. Harry was then . examined by a paediatrician who said he was not dehydrated, but she . recommended he be given Dioralyte, a rehydration treatment to boost his . salt and sugar levels. Devastated: The traumatic experience of watching their son's health deteriorate in less than a week will haunt parents Lucy and Raymond Connolly (pictured) 'for the rest of their lives' At 10.30am the next day, a second . doctor recommended Harry be  discharged and his parents given ‘48-hour . open access’ to the children’s ward, which meant they could bring him . back at any time. Mrs Connolly returned with him the . next day. But a third doctor refused to believe he was dehydrated and . sent him home. The next day – Good Friday – Harry’s grandmother was so . concerned that the toddler had ‘sunken eyes’ she phoned the hospital. But a nurse could not find Harry’s notes which showed he had ‘48-hour . access’. She told the family they would have to go through A&E or . their GP out-of-hours service, South East Health Limited. Out-of-hours GP Aboo Thamby said the . boy had a virus but was not dehydrated and did not need to go to . hospital. The next day Harry was still poorly but seemed brighter. He . went to bed at 9pm and was discovered dead in his cot in the early hours . by his father. In a narrative verdict, Mrs Pember described the . disorganised arrangements for the ‘open 48-hour ward access’ system as . ‘catastrophic’. She blamed doctors’ decisions not to . weigh Harry or take blood and urine samples from him for their failure . to diagnose his condition. Mr and Mrs Connolly are suing NGH and have lodged complaints to the General Medical Council about two of the doctors involved. The hospital has apologised and said changes had been made.","Harry Connolly’s parents begged for their son to be kept in hospital .
