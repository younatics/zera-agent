"(CNN) -- ""Any analyst at any time can target anyone. Any selector, anywhere ... I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President. ..."" Thus spoke -- this time not Zarathustra, the Persian prophet -- but former National Security Agency systems administrator Edward Snowden. To be sure, Snowden was reaching for dramatic effect, but if his words were true, he would have been violating not only the laws of the United States, he would also have been violating the laws of physics. He had neither the authority nor the ability to do what he has claimed he could do. To determine what we think of Snowden's allegations about the NSA's activities, we should have a clear idea of what the NSA is actually doing, not what Snowden implies or alleges or what some 24/7 networks allow their commentators to proclaim. The confusion is not entirely Snowden's fault. The story has been so badly mangled by the media that one of The Washington Post's ""exposes"" (on the PRISM program) has been rewritten, without benefit of announcing corrections, on the newspaper's website. So let us begin where Snowden did -- with the ""telephony metadata"" or business records program. It is clear that the NSA has access to large numbers of calling events that Americans create: who called whom, when and for how long, but neither the location of the communicants nor certainly the contents of the call. Why in heaven's name would they want this ""metadata"" -- the term of art applied to the externals of a communication, somewhat like what is on an envelope as opposed to the content of a letter? I'll tell you why. Before the attacks of 9/11, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar (part of the al Qaeda ""muscle"" on the plane that struck the Pentagon) were living in San Diego. From there on several occasions they called an al Qaeda safe house in the Middle East whose communications were targeted by American intelligence. The NSA intercepted a series of these calls and created intelligence reports on several of them. But nothing in the physics of these intercepts or in the contents of these calls (even looking at them in retrospect) told us that these two known terrorists were in the United States. After the 9/11 attacks, the intelligence committees of the U.S. Congress formed a joint inquiry commission to determine what had gone wrong. One of the commission's findings was to criticize the ""NSA's cautious approach to any collection of intelligence relating to activity in the United States."" Years later, in his 2008 book, ""The Shadow Factory,"" James Bamford -- a chronicler and inveterate critic of NSA activities and, it should be added, a participant in a lawsuit against the agency for its post-9/11 activities -- wrote about al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar that ""the Agency never alerted any (emphasis his) other Agency that the terrorists were in the United States and moving across the country toward Washington."" To be sure, the NSA never knew they were in the United States, but a career critic of alleged NSA privacy violations (Bamford) thought the agency did and should have known these two terrorists were in (that's my emphasis) this country and the Congress of the United States believed the NSA too ""cautious"" about intelligence in (my emphasis again) America. The metadata program was an attempt to deal with this challenge with the lightest possible impact on American privacy. After all, the Supreme Court had determined decades earlier (Smith v. Maryland, 1979) that metadata carried no expectations of privacy. Thus, it seemed the perfect approach. Properly used, metadata collection was not about targeting Americans. It was about determining who in America deserved (in all meanings of the word: legally, morally, operationally) to be targeted. And, as Steve Bradbury, the acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department during this period, has pointed out, ""At least 14 federal judges have approved the NSA's acquisition of this data every 90 days since 2006 under the business records provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)."" Billions of records are retained by the NSA under this program, but these records are accessed only under strict controls. No data mining engines or complex logarithmic tools are launched to scour the data for abstract patterns. Instead, the data lies fallow until the NSA can put a question to it based on a predicate related to terrorism and only terrorism. A little more than 20 people at the NSA get to do this, under close supervision, and the agency reports that this happens about 300 times a year. Let me describe a possible example of a ""terrorist predicate."" Let's say that somewhere in the world American intelligence comes across an individual it has good reason to believe is an al Qaeda operative, and he has a cell phone in his possession. Under this authority, the NSA could take the cell phone number and use a computer simply to ask that ocean of metadata, ""Is there any activity in here related to what we now believe to be a terrorist telephone?"" And if a number in the Bronx timidly raises its hand (so to speak) and answers, ""Why, yes, I routinely communicate with it,"" the agency gets to ask, ""And who do you and your friends talk to?"" That's it! If there is anything more to be done, the agency (actually, far more likely, the FBI) has to go back to court to dig any deeper into American information. This is hardly the East German Stasi, but there may be some in America who are still discomfited by it. Fair enough. But folks should object based on facts rather than on the oft heard and amazingly misinformed commentary in some of the media that claims the NSA can then go back and listen to these calls in its database -- listen to calls that have never been recorded and which, incidentally, are protected by the U.S. Constitution. And for those who still object, please keep in mind that, if the metadata program had been in effect in the summer of 2001, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar would likely have been rolled up, the plane that hit the Pentagon would not have had these jihadists available for the hijacking and the entire 9/11 enterprise might have been scrapped by al Qaeda. In my next column, I'll tackle: What of the PRISM program, the collection of Internet content with the compelled cooperation of American firms? And how is that enterprise viewed here and abroad?

"(CNN) -- A vehicle belonging to Italian diplomats appeared to be the target of a homemade bomb in the capital of Tripoli, the Libyan state news agency LANA reported Tuesday. The minivan was damaged and had some of its windows blown out by a blast, but no one was injured, the news agency said. It reported two embassy employees were initially in the car but had gotten out before the explosion. The Facebook page of the government's Supreme Security Committee in Tripoli said officials suspected the Toyota Previa had been rigged with an bomb and cordoned off the area. The explosive went off before the bomb squad arrived. LANA said officials suspected a small homemade bomb of blasting gelatin was used in the attack. The explosion occurred near a police station in the Zawiyat al-Dahmani district. The Italian embassy is in the same district. Italians in Libya were targeted earlier this year as well. In January, gunmen targeted the car of the Italian consul general in Benghazi. Consul General Guido de Sanctis was in an armored car pulling out of the garage when the gunmen pulled up alongside the vehicle and opened fire, he told CNN. Benghazi was also the site of a September 11 assault on the U.S. consulate that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.","Libya's official news agency said no one was injured by the explosion .

"(CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, are in Africa this week, where they renovated a cancer screening clinic in Zambia and commemorated the victims of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania. The clinic, which is designed help women fight cervical cancer, builds on the former president's work fighting AIDS on the continent. While he was in office, Bush set up a plan that dramatically reduced the number of AIDS deaths in Africa. ""I'm really proud of the American people for their generosity,"" he told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""I wish Americans knew how many lives were saved. Someday, they will."" Bush also told CNN why he respects Nelson Mandela, what he thinks about Edward Snowden and President Barack Obama, and how he's not going to be around when his legacy is finally decided. â€¢ On Snowden: ""I think he damaged the security of the country."" â€¢ On Mandela: ""His legacy will last for a long time."" â€¢ On Obama: ""It's a hard job. He's got plenty on his agenda."" Bush talked about Snowden, the computer contractor who leaked details about secret U.S. surveillance programs, to CNN's Robyn Curnow in Zambia on Sunday. He said he believes the Obama administration ""will deal"" with the fallout from the controversy unleashed by Snowden, who is now thought to be holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport after fleeing there from Hong Kong. Snowden's disclosures about the programs carried out by the National Security Agency have shaken the U.S. intelligence community and put the Obama administration on the defensive over accusations of government overreach into citizens' privacy. But Bush refrained from criticizing the current president. ""I don't think it does any good,"" he said. ""It's a hard job. He's got plenty on his agenda. It's difficult. A former president doesn't need to make it any harder. Other presidents have taken different decisions; that's mine."" The White House has defended the surveillance programs as necessary tools to defuse terrorist threats. Obama has said he welcomes a debate over how to strike a balance between security and privacy. ""I think there needs to be a balance, and as the president explained, there is a proper balance,"" Bush said. Asked about an NSA program that tracks people's Internet activity, Bush said, ""I put that program in place to protect the country. One of the certainties was that civil liberties were guaranteed."" Snowden has said he leaked information to journalists about the surveillance programs in the hope of ending what he called an excessively intrusive system. The Bushes were at a renovated health clinic in Livingstone, Zambia, scheduled to open Monday as a cervical cancer screening and treatment center. They hope this will save the lives of thousands of women. In his comments, George Bush touched on the subject of Mandela, who is on life support in a South African hospital. ""Sometimes, there are leaders who come and go. His legacy will last for a long time,"" he said of the ailing anti-apartheid icon. Reminded by Curnow that Mandela had criticized him publicly about the war in Iraq, Bush said he didn't bear a grudge. ""He wasn't the only guy,"" he said. ""It's OK. I made decisions that were the right decisions. History will ultimately judge. I never held someone's opinion against him; I didn't look at him differently because he didn't agree with me on an issue."" Bush also initially said he wasn't bothered about his ratings in opinion polls, even if some of them now put him at a similar level to Obama. ""The only time I really cared was on Election Day,"" he said. Then, drawing laughter from his wife, he checked himself and said, ""You know, I guess it's nice. I mean, let me rephrase that: Thank you for bringing it up."" In any case, the former president said he doesn't expect a fair assessment of his legacy in his lifetime. ""I won't be around, because it will take a while for the objective historians to show up,"" he said. ""So I'm pretty comfortable with it, I did what I did; I know the spirit in which I did it.""

"(CNN) -- The Navy detonated a large device described as being similar to a mine off the coast of Bay Head, New Jersey, Wednesday morning, sending a plume of water more than 100 feet in the air. The device, suspected to be either a moored or contact mine, was discovered Tuesday evening by a swimmer off the coast of Bay Head, about halfway between New York City and Atlantic City. The device was mostly buried in the sand, which made it hard to identify, according to Mike Brady, public affairs officer for the Naval Weapons Station Earle. An explosive ordnance disposal team was sent to detonate the device. The team determined the safest time to detonate the large device, which Brady said weighed several hundred pounds, was during the next high tide at 11 a.m. Wednesday. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we asked the local police to evacuate about 15 families from their homes in the immediate area while the detonation occurred,"" said Brady. The device was about 100 feet from the shoreline in 12 feet of water when the detonation occurred. There were no injuries. Brady said CNN it's unclear how the device got there or how long it had been there. It's possible the device may have moved during Superstorm Sandy, but it may never be clear where it came from. A piece of the device was secured and will be analyzed for clues about its origin. ""It's believed this is a one-of-a-kind event, and there do not appear to be any other devices in the area,"" Brady said.

"(CNN) -- An Ohio judge Friday classified as a sex offender one of two Steubenville, Ohio, teenagers convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl last year. Trent Mays, a former high school football player, must register every six months for 20 years with the sheriff and the county where he resides after he completes his sentence, Judge Thomas Lipps ruled, according to the court's chief probation officer, Fred Abdalla Jr. In March, Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were convicted after being tried as juveniles. Mays was also found guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor. The assault of the girl was partially documented in texts, tweets and pictures posted to the Internet. Mays was sentenced to a minimum of two years in a juvenile correctional facility. Richmond was sentenced to a minimum of one year, but like Mays, he could be in detention until he is 21. While Mays' status was the subject of Friday's hearing, no hearing date has been set for Richmond, according to Abdalla. The teens were accused of raping the girl during a series of end-of-summer parties in August 2012. The case received widespread attention after a blogger who once lived in Steubenville uncovered some materials posted to social media sites. The blogger wrote about the possibility that the teenagers had been given preferential treatment because they played on the town's highly regarded football team. Police have denied that claim. Later, the loosely organized hacker group Anonymous got involved, posting a lengthy video in which another teenager -- who has not been charged -- made joking references to the rape. The ensuing ire over the case brought national attention and criticism to the city from around the country, leaving city officials struggling to defend the community and residents weary of the media spotlight. HLN's Kisa Mlela Santiago contributed to the report.","A judge rules Trent Mays should be classified as a sex offender .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will review the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark legislation that cleared barriers to the ballot box for all American citizens. In Shelby County v. Holder, the Court will hear arguments on Section 5 -- the heart of the Voting Rights Act -- that allows the federal government to block state election practices that are discriminatory. A predominantly white county in Alabama, Shelby County, charges that the decision of Congress in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 is unconstitutional. The case comes on the heels of a federal election last fall in which our nation witnessed the greatest assault on voting rights in more than a half century. Drastic cuts to early voting hours, restrictive photo ID laws, tens of thousands of registered voters being dropped from poll books due to illegitimate purges were only a few of the tactics used to keep people from voting. Desiline Victor, a 102-year-old Miami resident who was invited to join first lady Michelle Obama at the recent State of the Union address, stood in line for more than three hours to cast a ballot. Sadly, thousands of voters had to endure waiting times up to eight hours, prompting President Barack Obama to call for the nation to ""fix it."" New laws and policies are being considered on the state and federal level now that will make it harder to vote -- particularly for the elderly, the young and people of color. Without the protections afforded by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, many Americans would find voting even more difficult. Election Day is the one day where we are all equal. Black, brown or white, rich or poor, we all have an equal say in the ballot box. Voting is the most fundamental pillar of a democracy and it is imperative that we keep elections free, fair and accessible to all. Opinion: Voting Rights Act and the South on trial . As this important debate begins anew, here are five key misconceptions you need to know about the Voting Rights Act and why it remains as relevant today as the day it was originally signed. Section 5 unfairly punishes the South for its past . This provision of the Voting Rights Act requires jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices to get federal ""pre-clearance"" (essentially, permission from the Department of Justice) before changing any voting procedure. This applies to not just Southern states, but also to other states such as Alaska, Arizona, along with certain counties in New York, Michigan, South Dakota, New Hampshire and California. Once a state has demonstrated that it can fairly run elections for a period of 10 years, it can be exempted from Section 5. In fact, every jurisdiction that has sought this ""bailout"" since 1982 has been approved. The jurisdictions that remain covered by Section 5 have not applied for bailouts. They are not being punished for their past, but held accountable for their present practices. The formula is outdated . Section 5 is not static, and dozens of jurisdictions have been added under the provision since it was first passed. In fact, Section 5 was reconsidered and reauthorized by Congress in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 2006 based on extensive evidence of continuing discrimination. The NAACP, Advancement Project and other civil rights advocates have long pushed for expanding Section 5's ""pre-clearance"" to include more states with voting problems, such as Ohio and Colorado, and more counties with records of egregious discrimination in voting. Doing so, however, takes Congressional action. So far, Washington's lawmakers have not demonstrated the political will. We should not revoke critical protections for fair voting simply because Congress has failed to act on expanding them. Section 5 is no longer applicable . The Voting Rights Act was passed not only for the most extreme acts of intimidation, but also for the small changes, such as literacy tests and poll taxes, that made voting harder for people of color and poor whites. The last few years leading up to the 2012 elections saw the greatest efforts to pass restrictive voting laws since the post-Reconstruction era, including limiting the type of ID that people can use, and requiring additional proof of citizenship to register and vote, all of which disproportionately impact people of color and the working poor. These adjustments unfairly shift the goal line and demonstrate why Section 5 is still needed. Section 2 is sufficient to ensuring fair voting procedures . While Section 2 of the law bans voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity, it is enforced only through lawsuits. When lawsuits are filed, the burden of proof rests with the challenger (not the local or state government that has changed voting rules). In contrast, Section 5 ensures that discrimination can't take hold by blocking problematic policies from going into effect in the first place. Without these precautions, unfair voting policies would go unchecked, leaving disenfranchised voters to face harm later. The country reelected an African-American president, with a large share of support from black and Latino voters, so we no longer need their votes to be protected by Section 5 . Section 5 made a difference in the 2012 elections. It blocked restrictive photo ID laws in Texas and South Carolina, and was used to reject a Texas redistricting plan that would undercut Latino voting power. And as the U.S. Department of Justice reviews Mississippi's photo ID law, that measure is on hold. It is against this backdrop that the Supreme Court will hear the challenge to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Losing this provision would signal a green light for even more partisan legislatures to manipulate election laws for political gains. At a time when voting rights are increasingly under attack, we should be expanding federal oversight of voting laws -- not scrapping the most effective civil rights legislation ever enacted. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Penda D. Hair and Benjamin Todd Jealous.","On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will review the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .

"(CNN) -- He thought the bleeding was a hemorrhoid, brought on by a strenuous weightlifting session at the gym. He thought the fatigue was due to his life on the road, performing coast-to-coast with the band Alabama's lead singer, Randy Owen. He thought at 42, he was too young to get a colonoscopy. Then the excruciating pain hit. Wade Hayes, the country musician best known for his No. 1 hit ""Old Enough to Know Better,"" spent Thanksgiving in the hospital. His intestine had collapsed in on itself -- a condition called intussusception. Intussusception blocks food and liquid from passing through the intestine and cuts off the blood supply to the rest of the digestive tract, according to the Mayo Clinic. Normally found in children, it's rare in adults unless caused by an underlying condition. For Hayes, that underlying condition was stage IV colon cancer. Doctors discovered a large tumor had caused the collapse. And that wasn't the end of the bad news. The cancer had metastasized, or spread. Surgeons removed approximately 70% of Hayes' liver and more than 20 inches of his large intestine. ""You just don't expect a man in his young 40s, who was perfectly healthy in every other way, to get this kind of diagnosis,"" says Hayes' manager, Mike Robertson. ""There was a part of me that was going, 'Surely this can't be happening.' "" Colorectal cancer -- often referred to as colon cancer -- is the third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women, according to the American Cancer Society. It's also the most preventable. Colorectal cancer usually develops slowly, over the course of 10 to 15 years, from noncancerous polyps. Approximately 90% of new cases occur in people over the age of 50. The American Cancer Society recommends colonoscopies every 10 years for people beginning at that age, unless they have high risk factors such as a family history of colorectal cancer or another gastrointestinal disease. Colonoscopies can spot and remove polyps before they become malignant. Coming clean about my first colonoscopy . ""Oftentimes, [colorectal cancer] has no symptoms,"" says Dr. Paul Limburg, a gastrointestinal cancer prevention specialist at the Mayo Clinic who has not treated Hayes. ""The most important message is that people really should understand that screening should be done regularly. It could make a substantial difference in the number of lives saved."" Hayes had no family history of gastrointestinal disease, which is one of the reasons he ignored his symptoms for so long. In fact, when he walked into the hospital in November, he was in better shape than everyone in the waiting room, Robertson remembers. Since then, Hayes has lost 50 pounds and is struggling to regain a sense of normalcy through multiple rounds of chemotherapy. He's fighting an uphill battle -- a 2004 study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute estimated the five-year survival rate for stage IV colon cancer to be 8.1%, and an institute study of cancer data put the survival rate at 6%. ""It hurts like hell,"" Hayes says of his recovery. ""I always thought of myself as a man's man, but I just discovered what a wuss I am."" Thankfully, Hayes is anything but alone in Nashville. Willie Nelson called from Hawaii to wish him well. Kix Brooks helped him connect with the best doctors in the city. Jay DeMarcus from Rascal Flatts arranged for a private room at Vanderbilt hospital. ""That part of it has been really shocking for me. I had no idea how many people cared about me or even knew I existed."" Robertson says that's the kind of person Hayes is -- modest to a fault; an introvert who enjoys reading detective dramas and has no desire to just sit around. Hayes lives with his dog, Jack, a boxer he found as a stray, eating out of the garbage at a filling station 75 miles from Nashville. He loaded the starving, tick-covered dog into the back of his truck and took him home, where Jack proceeded to chew on everything in sight. ""He's very lovable but a pain the ass -- just like me,"" Hayes says with a laugh. Hayes' scans were clear of tumors in early March. But the musician still has four more months of chemotherapy to go. Chemo has left his hands and mouth incredibly sensitive. Food tastes funny, and touching anything cold feels like ""being electrocuted."" Some days, he has trouble gripping his guitar. He performed at the Stars Go Blue benefit concert for Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month on March 6 but had trouble singing because of the chemo's effects on his vocal cords. He's eager to get back to writing music, but the chemotherapy chemicals invading his body make it difficult to concentrate. ""He's seen something taken away that he's very passionate to get back to,"" Robertson says of Hayes' impatience. ""He's always bounced back from everything. I think he thought he'd have the surgery, and then. ... The recovery has taken longer than he expected."" Still, Hayes is doing his best to help the process along. Studies have shown that environmental and dietary factors can influence your risk of colorectal cancer, according to Limburg. A low-fat, high-fiber diet is good, as is regular exercise. ""In general, things that are healthy overall, are healthy for your colon,"" Limburg says. So Hayes is eating less red meat, more fruits and vegetables. He's sold his house in the city and is hoping to buy a small farm in the country. Most importantly, he's speaking out about getting screened early and often. ""If I had caught it early, I wouldn't be where I am now.""

"(CNN) -- Australia has a new prime minister. And its first female premier, defeated in a decisive vote 57-45 in favor of the man she ousted in 2010, has now resigned. With observers suggesting her government faces a landslide defeat in September's election, Prime Minister Julia Gillard was very much a leader under siege from within her own ranks when she called for a leadership ballot. ""I wouldn't be putting myself forward unless I had a degree of confidence about the support of my colleagues,"" she told Australia's Sky News in an exclusive interview ahead of Wednesday's ballot. Gillard added that she would retire from politics if she lost the vote and the support of her parliamentary colleagues. She urged whoever challenged her to do the same. Gillard did not however name Kevin Rudd who promised to exit political life if he failed to win the support of his parliamentary colleagues. The change in the leadership of the Australian Labor Party comes a little over three years since Gillard toppled Kevin Rudd in a coup dubbed ""the night of the long knives,"" and backed by key party power brokers. That was June 24, 2010. Gillard went into a federal election in August 2010 with the Labor Party failing to win an outright majority in the parliament. She has since ruled with the support of three independents and a Green Party member. But the political and public disquiet over the toppling of a sitting prime minister never abated. Hugely popular among Australians, Rudd, then foreign minister, challenged Gillard for the leadership in February 2012. He overwhelmingly lost the ballot and was relegated to the backbenches. Gillard's strength of character has consistently been on display throughout her leadership. As leader, she is widely acknowledged to have deftly dealt with the challenges of a hung parliament. Her government has formulated and negotiated several critical pieces of legislation: a national disability insurance scheme and, on the day she lost power, a new formula to fund government schools. Her feisty performance in parliament in October 2012, when she described opposition leader Tony Abbott as a misogynist, won her much admiration around the world. But among voters at home, she has experienced a steady decline in popularity. In the past two weeks, polls showed her government would be overwhelmingly defeated in the election she had called for September 14. If the poll numbers hold through to the election, more than 30 Labor members of parliament will lose their seats. The slings and arrows rarely stopped coming throughout her three-year tenure -- with much of the criticism becoming personal. Gillard has been criticized over her voice (described by many as nasal and monotone), the length of her nose, her fashion choices, and even her figure. Whether Australians found it difficult to accept a female prime minister or not, her leadership placed sexism, particularly in public life, firmly on the agenda. Gillard put the issue of misogyny back under the spotlight three weeks ago when she spoke to a new ""Women for Gillard"" support group and questioned if the opposition coalition would re-open the abortion issue in Australia if it won power in September. State, rather than federal, law governs abortion. Many Labor party backbenchers openly criticized Gillard for re-opening the issue, along with high profile feminists. It was viewed largely as a political stunt as was her reference in the same speech to the opposition coalition's ""men in blue ties,"" who she said would banish women from political life. The speech saw a 7% decrease in support for her Labor Party in a poll subsequently released. But the sexism issue also proved to be as damaging for political opponents -- particularly when the menu at a Liberal Party fundraiser recently was leaked to the media. It described a main meal of quail with ""small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box."" Strongly condemned by opposition leader Tony Abbott, and despite denials that the menu was written as a joke by the owner of the restaurant where the fundraiser was to be held and was not endorsed by the Liberal Party, ""Menu-gate"" as it became known, added credence to Gillard's argument. In the same week, while in Western Australia to discuss her reforms to education funding, Gillard was asked by a radio shock jock whether her partner, Tim Mathieson, a former hairdresser, was homosexual. The implication of the question was that her relationship was a sham given Gillard's refusal to marry, which has played poorly among some voters. ""Well, that's absurd,"" responded Gillard. Howard Sattler who was later sacked. ""You hear it! He must be gay; he's a hairdresser,"" Sattler continued. Shortly afterward the shock jock was suspended by his employer over the interview . A few days later, another radio announcer criticized Gillard for showing too much cleavage. ""I don't think it's appropriate for a prime minister to be showing her cleavage in parliament... I just think it is inappropriate. I don't want to see any politician's flesh in parliament,"" Grace Collier told an ABC Radio program. Following these comments, Gillard's army of female supporters took to posting photographs of their breasts on Twitter using the hashtag ""convoyofcleavage."" But over the past two weeks, Gillard's staunchest parliamentary and ministerial supporters have declared their continued support for her. As her popularity among voters waned, Rudd took to the streets where reaction to his every appearance was of a rock star proportion. Rudd consistently denied he would challenge Gillard for the leadership. He was a ""no show"" in March this year when Gillard reacted to leadership chatter by calling a ballot that was not contested. But on Wednesday, as his supporters gathered signatures to a petition calling for another ballot, he changed his mind. He said Australians wanted a real choice. ""At present, they don't feel as if they have got one,"" Rudd told a news conference ahead of the ballot. ""They are frustrated and angry that we are leaving them with little choice other than to vote for Mr Abbott."" Widely credited with having steered Australia through the global financial crisis, Rudd told the conference Australia needed his steady economic leadership because the country's resources boom was ending. ""Given our economic relationship with China accounts for 10% of our economy this is a massive challenge,"" Rudd said. ""Diversification is essential for Australia if we are to protect our jobs and maintain our living standards."" Rudd also promised he would not seek retribution against any of his parliamentary colleagues who, since the last leadership ballot he lost in March 2012 have paraded their disdain for him. He said he would embrace those wanted to continue working with him and would thank those who refused, for their services. The decision to change leader may now trigger a constitutional crisis if the country's Governor General demands proof that the Mandarin speaking Kevin Rudd can harness the support of the parliament.","Australian PM's Labor Party voted her out of its leadership for former premier Kevin Rudd .

"Washington (CNN) -- A woman arrested in connection with the splattering of paint in two locations inside the National Cathedral in Washington was ordered held without bond Tuesday. Jiamei Tian, 58, has been charged with felony destruction of property. When officers arrested her on Monday, she had green paint on her clothes and shoes, and paint cans were found in three bags she had with her, according to a police report obtained by CNN. If found guilty, she could face up to 10 years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Tian will be kept in custody at least until a second hearing, which is scheduled for Friday morning. That hearing will determine whether there is probable cause to continue to hold her. If she is held, she would be entitled to another hearing within 100 days. During her appearance in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia Tuesday, Tian wore a white jumpsuit and appeared disheveled with messy hair. She was calm throughout. Early on, while waiting her turn near the front of the courtroom, Tian appeared to be smiling. A Mandarin interpreter was brought in to assist her during the proceedings. According to court documents, Tian had a visa allowing her to be in the United States that expired on Saturday. She traveled on a Chinese passport. Prosecutors argued she was a serious flight risk with no fixed address. ""She's been in the community for only a few days, and the government would argue that there is strong evidence that the defendant's presence in the district is for no other purpose than to deface national monuments and landmarks,"" said prosecutor Kevin Chambers. After Tian's arrest, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lodged an immigration detainer against her, meaning that ICE wants to be notified before local law enforcement releases her. In other incidents, green paint was used recently to deface the Lincoln Memorial, a statue of Martin Luther in Thomas Circle and a statue in front of a Smithsonian building, the court documents said. Tian was not immediately tied to those events, and her lawyer, Nancy Glass, argued there is no evidence directly connecting Tian to them. Her clothes were sent to a forensics team to determine whether the paint on them matches the paint at the other locations. Another landmark in Washington -- Luther Place Memorial Church -- was also defaced. The court documents allege that a woman matching Tian's description was seen at the church Sunday. The church is right next to the defaced statue of Martin Luther. White paint mixed with urine and feces was splattered on the church's organ. At the cathedral, in Washington's northwest quadrant, paint was discovered on an organ console and casework inside the historic Bethlehem Chapel, in the building's lower level. A spokesman said the paint was wet when it was discovered. Paint was also found in the Children's Chapel, in the cathedral's nave. The cathedral is a popular tourist destination. It said that repairs, estimated to cost $15,000, have already begun. Five miles south, on the National Mall, green paint was discovered on a statue outside the Smithsonian Institution Building, known widely as the Castle. Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian's chief spokeswoman, said the statue is of Joseph Henry, the first secretary of the federally administered group of museums. CNN's Greg Seaby, Carol Cratty, Dana Ford, Erin McPike and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.","If found guilty, she could face up to 10 years in prison and a $5,000 fine .

"(CNN) -- A Minnesota man hit the jackpot, literally. Paul White of Ham Lake, Minnesota, stepped forward Thursday to claim one-third of a $448 million Powerball jackpot, according to the Minnesota State Lottery. The other two winning ticket-holders have not stepped forward. The two tickets were sold in New Jersey, one at a Super Stop n Shop in South Brunswick and the other at an Acme Market in Little Egg Harbor, Carole Hedinger, the executive director of the New Jersey Lottery, told reporters Thursday. White, a project engineer at Elliott Contracting in Minneapolis, said he's imagined winning the Powerball jackpot ""so many times in my head."" That dream became a reality when White got a telephone call Thursday morning from a friend telling him one of the winning tickets was sold in Minneapolis. His ticket matched the winning numbers: 5, 25, 30, 58, 59 and Powerball number 32. Though he could have chosen to receive $149.4 million over 30 years, he said he chose the immediate cash option of $86 million, which will net him $58.3 million after taxes. White bought the winning ticket at the Holiday Stationstore in Ham Lake, north of Minneapolis, he said. The odds of getting hit by lightning in any given year are about one in 500,000. You are about 350 times LESS likely to win the Powerball lottery. The odds of cracking one that big? Who knows and who cares, when you're splitting the equivalent of about the net worth of Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, according to Forbes magazine? Why you keep playing the lottery . Giant U.S. lottery jackpots have been coming more frequently, observers say. ""You could see maybe in the next several years ... an elusive billion-dollar jackpot,"" said Victor Matheson, economics professor at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. Had no one won Wednesday evening, the prize would have swollen to an estimated $600 million for Saturday's drawing, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. With the winning tickets, the jackpot falls to $40 million. The all-time largest U.S. jackpot was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs $2.

"(CNN) -- The Ohio man who imprisoned three women in his Cleveland home for a decade will speak at length during his sentencing Thursday, delivering a statement that his sister promises will allow people to see ""the other side of Ariel Castro."" Castro pleaded guilty last week to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping, in a deal that dropped a possible death penalty in exchange for life in prison plus 1,000 years. He'll give a rather lengthy statement, explaining his life and who he really is, his sister, Marisol Alicea, told CNN on Wednesday night. ""(People will) see the other side of Ariel Castro ... not the monster that everyone thinks he is,"" she said, adding that she was in no way defending her brother. ""He must pay for what he did."" Alicea said she doesn't plan on attending the sentencing with others in her family, fearing the evidence will be too graphic. The sentencing hearing is expected to last hours and include witness testimony and evidence, a Cuyahoga County court source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CNN. Prosecutors want to make sure there's a record going forward in case of a future appeal, should Castro want to try to get out of prison, said the source who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Prosecutors also want the court and the public to understand the impact Castro's actions had on his victims and the community. At least one of Castro's victims, Michelle Knight, will likely make an impact statement during the hearing, Alicea said. An official with direct knowledge of the investigation also said Knight intends to speak. In a handwritten note, posted Wednesday on the Cleveland Police Community Relations Facebook page, Knight said she was overwhelmed with the support she has received from ""complete strangers."" ""It is comforting. Life is tough, but I'm tougher,"" she wrote. ""Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, she became a butterfly. Thanks."" It is unclear if the other two women -- Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry -- will address the court. They could make a videotaped statement, or a family member could talk on their behalf. Ariel Castro's son: I won't visit dad in prison . Prosecutors also have submitted an evaluation of Castro's confinement and abuse of Knight, DeJesus and Berry that was compiled by acclaimed psychiatrist Frank Ochberg, considered a pioneer in trauma science. The evaluation was part of the prosecution's pre-sentencing report, which has been submitted to the court. The evaluation -- using statements, medical records, videotaped interviews and transcripts -- painted a horrifying picture of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of Castro that included brutal beatings and repeated rapes that resulted in pregnancies that he would end by punching the women in the stomach. ""He appeared to be evolving in an ever more dangerous direction, capturing younger and younger women, telling his captives he was hunting for replacements,""Ochberg wrote. Castro abducted Knight, Berry and DeJesus separately over a two-year period between 2002 and 2004, according to investigators. The women and Berry's 6-year-old daughter were held in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home. DNA tests have confirmed that Castro is the child's father. In the evaluation, Ochberg wrote that Knight -- who was kidnapped first -- suffered ""the longest and most severely."" ""But it was Michelle who served as doctor, nurse, midwife and pediatrician during the birth (of Berry's child). She breathed life into that infant when she wasn't breathing,"" he wrote. ""At other times, she interceded when Castro sought to abuse Gina, interposing herself and absorbing physical and sexual trauma. But each survivor had a will to prevail and used that will to live through the ordeal."" The women were freed in May after Berry shouted for help while Castro was away. Neighbor Charles Ramsey said he heard their cries as he was sitting down to eat. ""I see this girl going nuts trying to get out of a house,"" he told CNN affiliate WEWS. ""I go on the porch and she says, 'Help me get out. I've been in here a long time.' "" Finally free, Berry pleaded for a phone. ""Help me, I am Amanda Berry,"" she frantically told a 911 operator. ""I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here, I'm free now."" In early July, Berry, DeJesus and Knight released a YouTube video offering their thanks to all those who have helped them since they were freed. They have not faced their captor and tormentor since their rescue. ""I want to thank everyone who has helped me and my family through this entire ordeal. Everyone who has been there to support us has been a blessing,"" Berry said in the video. ""I'm getting stronger each day."" Why so many high-profile crimes in Cleveland?

""There is more than one party that benefits from me not ever stepping back on the field -- and that's not my teammates and it's not the Yankee fans,"" Rodriguez said Friday night at a news conference in Trenton, New Jersey, following a minor-league game that was supposed to prepare him to rejoin the New York Yankees.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama called on Sunday for ""calm reflection"" following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. The president, in a written statement, acknowledged an emotionally charged climate but concluded that ""we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken."" Obama called Martin's death a tragedy for America. ""I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,"" he said. ""I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,"" Obama said. Analysis: The race factor in George Zimmerman's trial . A Florida jury on Saturday night found Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in a shooting that grew from a confrontation as Martin, 17, walked home from a convenience store in February 2012. The verdict closed a case in state criminal court that gained national attention and sparked public outcry, much of which focused on race. Reaction generated some protests nationally, including outside the White House. Zimmerman is the son of a Peruvian mother and a white American father and identifies as Hispanic. Martin was African-American. Catch up on the trial, verdict . Obama said in closing his statement that Americans asking ""ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this"" is one way ""to honor Trayvon Martin."" Groups disappointed with the jury's decision have asked the Obama administration to pursue a civil rights prosecution against Zimmerman, 29. The NAACP has called on the Justice Department to file related charges and has asked the public to sign a petition to support their cause. ""When you look at (Zimmerman's) comments, when you look at his comments about young black men in that neighborhood, about how they felt specially targeted by him, there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,"" NAACP president and CEO Benjamin Jealous said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" What was the reaction around the country? Obama did not cover that issue in his comments. But the Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that a federal civil rights investigation continues and it will look at evidence and testimony from the just-concluded state trial as part of the probe. ""Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,"" the statement said. The government would need to establish that a hate crime was committed in order to bring charges, a legal threshold Holder has said previously would be challenging to meet. ""For a federal hate crime we have to prove the highest standard in the law,"" Holder said in April 2012. ""Something that was reckless, that was negligent does not meet that standard. We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind."" A petition asking for civil rights prosecution of Zimmerman on the White House ""We The People"" site - a page that lets citizens submit petitions to the White House - was started Sunday. So far, it has more than 4,000 signatures, a number far short of the 100,000 necessary to get a response from the White House. Zimmerman fears for life, could face new charges . Obama's first comments on the Zimmerman trial came in March 2012, when the president said the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teen required national ""soul searching."" The president also personalized the shooting in those remarks. He told reporters he thought about his own children when he thought about Martin. ""I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together -- federal, state and local -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened,"" Obama said at that time. Verdict doesn't end debate in Martin's death . Obama said the case struck home with him when asked about any racial components of the case. ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" the president said then. Republicans at the time criticized Obama for personalizing the shooting and on Sunday, Rep. Steve King alleged the president and his administration had turned the case into a political issue rather than a legal matter. ""The evidence didn't support prosecution and the Justice Department engaged in this. The president engaged in this and turned it into a political issue that should have been handled exclusively with law and order,"" King, an outspoken Republican from Iowa, said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Since Obama's first comments, the White House has kept its distance from the case. Full coverage of the case on HLNTV.com .

"(CNN) -- ""Well, if it's a comeback you want, then get your hands raised,"" Jakob Dylan declares on the Wallflowers' first album in seven years, ""Glad All Over."" So should we raise our hands and call the band's return a comeback? Despite the lyric, Dylan says no. In New York on Monday morning, fresh off a performance for ""Good Morning America"" -- which he jokingly called ""Very Early Morning America"" -- the Wallflowers frontman said, ""It's not like we were a band that broke up and got back together. We never broke up. We lost the plot a bit, and we needed a break, so we took one. We just needed time to find each other again."" Plus, it's good timing, given the coincidental and unrelated release of the movie ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" ""It can only be good, right? To have the name Wallflowers out there again?"" The Wallflowers broke through in 1996 with the quadruple-platinum album ""Bringing Down the Horse"" before going on hiatus in 2007. During their time apart, Dylan recorded two solo albums -- ""Seeing Things"" and ""Women and Country"" -- while keyboardist Rami Jaffee took to the road with the Foo Fighters, giving them time to explore music they couldn't explore together. Reuniting gave them a new sense of direction, ""like a reset button,"" Dylan said. Road-testing the new material this summer by mixing it up with hits such as ""6th Avenue Heartache,"" ""One Headlight"" and ""The Difference"" on a mini-tour has given the band a chance to see how audiences respond or even who that audience is anymore. If Dylan ever used to measure himself against his more famous father, Bob, that's nothing compared with his previous chart-topping success, which made him a rock star as well as a heartthrob. ""Things have changed since 'Bringing Down the Horse,' "" he acknowledged. ""MTV brought our music to a lot of kids, and even then, we wondered if we were reaching the right audience. But I'm lucky. I don't hate our old songs, and I don't mind playing them. I don't have that problem."" And with the new songs added, ""I don't think we sound like 1995 or 2002. It sounds like now, but filtered."" Content with where the band is now, the Wallflowers acknowledge the feeling in the new album title. Rob Thomas claimed recently that the Wallflowers were considering naming the new album ""North,"" but Matchbox Twenty (orchestrating a comeback of their own?) beat them to it, a claim Dylan laughs about. ""That's a little bit of a misunderstanding,"" he clarified. "" 'North' was on a list of about 20 possibilities, but we chose 'Glad All Over' for its double meaning."" Plus, ""Glad All Over"" has been used as titles for songs performed by the Beatles and the Dave Clark Five, so the musical legacy had appeal. For now, the band -- guitarist Stuart Mathis, bassist Greg Richling, new drummer Jack Irons and Jaffee -- has enough cleverness to tide them over on ""Glad,"" which includes such rousing new tracks as ""Hospital for Sinners,"" ""Misfits and Lovers"" and ""Reboot the Mission,"" featuring one of Dylan's guitar heroes, Mick Jones. ""The Clash left a big impact on me,"" Dylan said, ""and I feel like we came all this way because of them. I got a Telecaster because of them."" ""Reboot the Mission"" even includes a shout-out to Joe Strummer as well as songs paying tribute to ZZ Top. ""You probably would be surprised to know I'm a ZZ Top fan,"" Dylan said. ""But I can't play like Billy Gibbons."" Most of album's other lyrics address love and spirituality, ""but no more than before,"" Dylan said. ""Spirituality and the Bible make for great songwriting. They can't be beat!"" Yet even the most obvious lyrics shouldn't be taken too literally, he cautioned. ""There's no real narrative,"" Dylan said. ""I mean, the lyrics are planned in advance, but they're not about me, and you won't know the meaning unless I tell you. And they could mean anything. I could tell you, or you think you know, but I could be making stuff up."" Dylan doesn't look down upon fabrication, even the more scandalous form that recently affected his father when journalist Jonah Lehrer was found to have made up quotes from the elder Dylan in his book ""Imagine: How Creativity Works"" and consequently lost his posts at The New Yorker and Wired. ""Why did he have to quit?"" the younger Dylan asked. ""It's probably happened before (to Bob Dylan), and I don't know that he's necessarily be by bothered by that or expect the guy to resign."" While Lehrer's fabrications went against the ethics and standards of his profession, the songwriting community is more open to invention and interpretation. To demonstrate, Dylan took a song from the new album at random -- ""Constellation Blues"" -- and came up with a viable interpretation of it on the spot, giving it a cosmic yet nonsensical meaning probably unintended when he wrote it. ""And who's to say I'm wrong? But I could be lying,"" he added, laughing. ""But isn't it strange how it's become the songwriter's job to explain the songs? It's not like three-minute pop songs fall out of the sky, but I think if you have to explain the song, it's not a good song. And some songs defy explanation. Otherwise, we wouldn't have 'Gabba Gabba Hey' "" from the Ramones song ""Pinhead."" Now that the Wallflowers are over their hiatus, Jaffee's other group, the aforementioned Foos, are going on theirs, as announced by Dave Grohl while performing in Central Park on Saturday night. But don't blame the Wallflowers for stealing him back. ""I knew Rami first!"" Dylan said. ""And he's been able to manage juggling both bands before. So I hope we're not the cause.""","The Wallflowers have released their first album in seven years .

"(CNN) -- The kind of sinkhole that suddenly opened up under a Florida home is more common than you might think. Let's take a look at what causes them, where they happen and just how dangerous and costly they can be: . What causes sinkholes? Many sinkholes form when acidic rainwater dissolves limestone or similar rock beneath the soil, leaving a large void that collapses when it's no longer able to support the weight of what's above, whether that be an open field, a road or a house. These are called ""cover-collapse sinkholes,"" and it would appear this is what's happening in Florida, where the ground beneath the home suddenly gave way. Where do they happen? Sinkholes are particularly common in Florida, which rests on a nearly unbroken bed of limestone, according to the Florida Sinkhole Research Institute. Central Florida, including the Tampa area, is particularly known for sinkholes. In fact, Hillsborough County, where Thursday's collapse occurred, is known as part of Florida's so-called Sinkhole Alley, where two-thirds of insurance claims for sinkhole damage occur, according to a report prepared for state lawmakers in 2010. Other places that frequently see sinkholes include Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Pennsylvania, the U.S. Geological Survey says. Do all sinkholes collapse so dramatically? No, some merely cause the ground above to sag, or result in small ponds or saltwater marshes, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection says. How often do they happen? There do not appear to be any solid numbers, but the Florida Senate Committee on Banking and Insurance reported that insurers had received 24,671 claims for sinkhole damage in that state alone between 2006 and 2010. That's an average of nearly 17 claims a day, just in Florida. How dangerous and costly are sinkholes? Deaths and injuries from sinkholes are rare, but certainly not unheard of. For instance, in 2012, a 15-year-old girl died when her family's car fell into a Utah sinkhole, according to media accounts. But the holes are enormously costly. Insurance claims submitted in Florida alone between 2006 and 2010 totaled $1.4 billion, according the Florida Senate report.","Central Florida is particularly known for sinkholes .

"(CNN) -- Whovians, clear your calendars -- the next star of the British science-fiction series ""Doctor Who"" will be unveiled Sunday during a live half-hour television special on the BBC. The 12th Doctor of the long-running show, which has aired 33 seasons and nearly 800 episodes since it premiered in 1963, will be revealed in front of a studio audience set against a backdrop of a swirling vortex, Daleks, and the TARDIS, the BBC has announced. Peter Capaldi, who starred as a foul-mouthed spin doctor in the British political comedy series ""The Thick of It,"" has been the odds-on favorite to step into the good Doctor's blue phone booth-shaped time machine after Matt Smith, the 11th Doctor, announced in June that he would be leaving the show after four years. Ben Stephenson, Controller of BBC Drama Commissioning, said: ""We can't wait to unveil the next Doctor ... It's the biggest secret in showbiz, even those working with the new Doctor on other projects at the moment have no idea they are in the presence of the 12th incarnation."" The show will air live simultaneously on BBC One in Britain at 6:00 p.m. GMT and on BBC America at 2:00 p.m. ET. READ MORE: ""Doctor Who"" to mark 50 years with biopic . The seminal British series first aired in 1963 -- when the broadcast of the premiere was delayed due to coverage of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy -- and spawned a number of spinoffs, books, stage performances and radio shows before going off the air in 1989. The show returned to television in 2005 to critical acclaim in Britain. The BBC has said it will debut the new Doctor in this year's Christmas special. Rory Kinnear, who played Bill Tanner in the James Bond films ""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Skyfall,"" and Idris Elba, better known as Stringer Bell from the HBO drama ""The Wire,"" have also been tipped as candidates to be the next incarnation of the Time Lord. As fans eagerly await the appointment of the next Doctor, the BBC will celebrate the 50th anniversary of ""Doctor Who"" with a biopic about the show's origins. ""An Adventure in Space and Time"" will premiere later this year and fictionally recounts the creation of the series while exploring the team behind its first episode. The show will also mark the highly-anticipated milestone on November 23 with a special episode starring Matt Smith, David Tennant -- Smith's predecessor -- and John Hurt as the Doctor, according to the BBC.

"(CNN) -- Everyone knows the story of Old Faithful. Here's the story of Old Unreliable. The Steamboat geyser at Yellowstone National Park is the world's tallest active geyser, but it's unpredictable, sometimes waiting months or decades between eruptions. Once, in the 1960s, it erupted 29 times in a year. It's rare to be there when Steamboat wakes up. Its eruptions are massive and impressive, reaching as high as 400 feet and lasting as long as 40 minutes. And the show doesn't end there: A thick column of thundering steam spews for hours after an eruption, as if it's a giant steam engine. Steamboat must have decided it was showtime again on Wednesday. For the first time in eight years, and without warning, the geyser suddenly erupted in a massive spectacle, stunning those on the observation deck, who raced to pull out their cameras. ""We estimate this eruption was about 200 to 300 feet high, and then it just steamed for about 24 hours,"" said Yellowstone spokesman Dan Hottle. It took park rangers about two hours to get there. Because of the number of geysers at Yellowstone -- 300, which is more than half of the world's total -- rangers rely on electronic heat sensors placed at each geyser to tell them when one has gone off. Steamboat is in the Norris Geyser Basin in Wyoming. ""When it jumps up, we know we've had an eruption shoot up,"" Hottle said. With Steamboat, ""we saw that jump and then some folks called that it happened."" Hottle said only about 30 or 40 people saw it Wednesday. Now, fans are pumped up for the next unexpected show. ""For us, it's exciting. Every time you're down there, you wonder if that'll be the time that it erupts,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Florida, already threatened with sinkholes, now has a new terror: rat-sized, tire-puncturing snails. Sounding like something out of a 1950s B-movie, these giant African land snails eat their way through some surprising stuff, including stucco, plastic recycling bins, signs and more than 500 species of plants, says the Florida Department of Agriculture. Their calcium shells bear pointy edges that are sharp enough to blow out tires of vehicles that run over them. Agriculture Department spokeswoman Denise Feiber says the menacing creatures also carry a human parasite called rat lungworm, which is a form of meningitis and potentially deadly. So far, no human cases have been reported in Florida, Feiber says. But some giant African land snails that have been captured in the state have carried the parasite. The snails are isolated to the Miami-Dade County area, says Feiber. Experts don't know exactly how they were first introduced to the United States. It's thought they may have hitched rides aboard incoming travelers' luggage. Or some of them may have been intentionally carried into the country as pets -- and then released. The snails have another trait in common with rats: They can multiply very rapidly -- and grow to adulthood in a year, Feiber says. The snails can produce up to 1,200 eggs per year, and they can live up to nine years. Since agriculture officials first discovered the snail invasion in 2011, trappers have collected more than 117,000. Officials are hoping to prevent a worst-case scenario, where the snails would threaten Florida crops. Some countries, such as Ecuador and Barbados, have run out of resources to fight these critters, Feiber said.","Giant African snails are menacing Florida's Miami-Dade County, say agriculture officials .

"(CNN) -- A Maryland man recently died of rabies that he contracted from a tainted kidney he received in a transplant operation a year and a half ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health care teams are now giving anti-rabies shots to three other patients who received organs from the same donor as the patient, the CDC said. The Maryland man and three other people -- in Florida, Georgia and Illinois -- received organs from a person who died in Florida in 2011. Coincidentally, both the donor and the recipient who died are members of the military. The donor was a 20-year-old airman who was training to be an aviation mechanic in Pensacola, and the recipient was a retired Army veteran, according to the Department of Defense. Doctors knew the donor had encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, when they harvested the organs. However, no rabies test was done before the before the donor's kidneys, heart and liver were delivered for transplantation in September 2011, the CDC said. 4 shots enough to ward off rabies . The Maryland recipient died February 27 at the VA Medical Center in Washington, and doctors at the CDC diagnosed rabies as the cause of death. The CDC then examined autopsy tissue from the donor and determined he had died of the same type of rabies, which is spread by raccoons, according to the CDC. Health officials immediately contacted doctors caring for the other three organ recipients. They show no signs of rabies but are being treated with five doses of the rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin, which gives the body antibodies to protect itself against the rabies virus. Both treatments are shots in the upper arm. Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, director of the CDC's Office of Blood, Organ, and Other Tissue Safety, said the recipients' doctors were shocked to learn the donor's organs were tainted with rabies. ""Their first reaction was that it seemed unlikely because it's been almost a year and a half since the transplant,"" he said. In the only other U.S. outbreak of rabies among organ recipients, the four patients died within a month of transplant in 2004. The three other recipients are being tested for rabies, and health authorities are looking for family members or health care workers who might have had close contact with the donor or the recipient who died to see if they might also have the disease, said CDC spokeswoman Melissa Dankel. Why organs aren't tested for rabies . Before the airman died in Florida, he was experiencing ""changes in mental status,"" according to Kuehnert. He said the donor tested negative for several causes of encephalitis, including West Nile Virus and herpes. Organ donors are not routinely tested for rabies, even if they show the signs. One reason is rabies is extremely rare, with only one to three cases a year nationwide, according to Dr. Richard Franka, the CDC's acting rabies team lead. Also, many lifesaving organs would be lost if donors were tested for rabies. Only three or four facilities in the country are capable of testing for rabies in humans, Franka said, which means most hospitals would have to ship a potential donor's blood or tissue. It could take two days to get test results, and by then the organs would no longer be usable. Kuehnert said perhaps new rules need to be put in place to help doctors decide what to do with organs when the donor has died of encephalitis and no one knows why. ""What we need looking forward is a standardized approach when you have encephalitis of unknown cause so very important things like this aren't missed,"" he said. At least one transplant surgeon won't take organs when the donor has died of encephalitis of unknown origin. Dr. Amy Friedman, director of transplantation at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York, said the risk is too big. But she added that she does kidney transplants, and her patients can survive, at least in the short term, on dialysis. Other patients waiting for organs such as hearts or livers might die quickly without a transplant -- and sometimes the only organ available is one where the patient died of encephalitis and no one knows why. Those patients should be fully informed so they can decide if they want to take the risk, she wrote in a blog post Friday. ""Statistically it's quite likely the organ could be fine, but if it's not, everybody has trouble,"" she told CNN. CNN's Miriam Falco, Val Willingham and Georgiann Caruso contributed to this report.","A Maryland man who received a tainted organ in 2011 died last month .

"(CNN) -- The cigarette companies -- and, boy, it's hard to say this -- may turn out to be right. Not ""right"" in the sense we usually think of the word. The death, suffering and heartache that cigarettes have brought to millions of families is no longer in serious dispute. But in the courts right now, it is beginning to look as if those gruesome, graphic warning illustrations that were supposed to be plastered all over packs of cigarettes might not happen after all. You know the illustrations -- there has been abundant advance publicity about them. A photograph of a diseased lung, a picture of a tracheotomy hole in a man's throat, an illustration of a man with his bare chest surgically stitched up, a picture of rotting teeth. The full-color illustrations were mandated by the government to cover the entire top half of the front and back of every package of cigarettes. They were intended to be so revolting and so visually inescapable that potential customers would turn away. But five tobacco manufacturers have argued in federal court that what the government has ordered is in violation of the First Amendment. The cigarette companies say that freedom of speech must not be trampled upon -- and that for the government to tell private companies what large, ugly, dominant illustrations they must print on their packages is an infringement upon basic American principles. The government derives the power to do this from the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009, which was enacted by Congress. The R.J. Reynolds Co., manufacturer of Camel, Kool, Winston and Salem cigarettes, has said that the government-ordered images are ""intended to elicit loathing, disgust and repulsion."" U.S. District Judge Richard Leon appears to believe the cigarette manufacturers have a strong case. Back in November he issued a temporary injunction that blocked the forced publication of the images. At a hearing this month, he said: ""There's nothing on the record to suggest that Congress gave any clear and thoughtful analysis on the First Amendment implications of this."" He promised to have a final ruling soon. No matter how much many of us may dislike what cigarettes have done to the nation's health, the First Amendment argument is a compelling one. The government risks setting a troubling precedent when, regardless of how laudable the intentions, it tells someone -- either a person or a company -- that it must say and show things that aggressively advocate against the person's or company's own interests. That's the slipperiest of slopes to start sliding down. What about the text-only warning labels that have appeared on packs of cigarettes for decades? The cigarette companies have never liked them either, of course. But the argument in court is that there is a legal distinction between requiring labels that state facts and requiring illustrations that serve to actively advocate against the purchase of the product. The government believes that public health concerns are paramount; the cigarette companies contend that nothing outweighs free speech. The tobacco manufacturers, as we all know, have long made ample use of their own free speech. Some of the old advertisements for cigarettes, when you come upon them now, are simply astonishing. I recently saw a November 1936 national magazine advertisement for Camels, which presented cheerful, colorfully illustrated, course-by-course instructions on how to smoke five cigarettes at the table during Thanksgiving dinner to achieve ""the peaceful feeling that comes from good digestion and smoking Camels."" Among the tips: Start with tomato soup and ""smoke a Camel right after the soup."" Before asking for a second helping of turkey, ""smoke another Camel. Camels ease tension."" After the salad course, another Camel, which ""clears the palate and sets the stage for dessert."" It goes on. In 1954, when health concerns about cigarettes were gaining momentum, the Old Gold brand took out a double-spread national magazine ad that all but mocked the medical evidence. ""America, we love you!"" the ad began. ""Thanks again for putting your trust in the cigarette made by tobacco men ... not medicine men ... We promise! Old Gold will continue to cure just one thing: the world's best tobaccos ... Smoke Old Golds for a treat instead of a treatment."" If, in 2012, cigarettes were a new prescription drug, or a new over-the-counter medication, or a new snack, and the government knew what it knows now about the health ramifications, such a product would never be approved for consumer use. It would be yanked from the shelves right away. But cigarettes aren't a new product. They have a history of being sold legally. So the government is telling the manufacturers that they must run those illustrations to drive people away. Will it transpire -- will the government get its way? Or will the cigarette companies' First Amendment argument prevail? It has long been axiomatic that free speech stops at the right to yell ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater. But do cigarette marketers have the unfettered right to enthusiastically yell ""Smoke!"" to a crowded nation? You can almost bet that this one is going to end up in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.

"Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- The family of a missing Missouri baby continued to make news Friday, cutting ties with its attorney hours after canceling a police interview with the girl's two half-brothers. Cyndy Short, the attorney who had been speaking for the family of 11-month-old Lisa Irwin, is no longer working with the family, her Kansas City, Missouri, law firm announced Friday in a statement. There was no immediate indication as to who, if anyone, will represent the family instead. Meanwhile, Kansas City Police Captain Steve Young said late Thursday that the Irwin family's lawyer -- at that point, presumed to be Short -- had canceled a police interview with the girl's two older brothers. The boys, ages 8 and 6, were in the family's Kansas City home when the girl was reported missing on October 4. They were previously interviewed just after she disappeared, both for less than an hour, Kansas City police Capt. Steve Young said. The ""nonconfrontational"" re-interview planned for Friday would have been conducted by a child services specialist without a police officer in the room, according to Young. ""(It's) not an interrogation,"" he said. ""They are kids, after all."" It was unclear whether the boys' interviews will be rescheduled. Authorities have also said they are seeking tests on the boys, in order to eliminate them from all the DNA found in the home during a search. Police have said the infant's parents, Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, will not submit to separate interviews. But Short, speaking earlier as the couple's attorney, disputed that account. ""Being questioned separately is not the issue,"" Short said. She said the couple has been cooperative and has been interviewed separately as well as together. They don't mind being interviewed separately as long as the detectives are fair, open-minded and nonaccusatory, she said. Lisa was reported missing about 4 a.m. October 4, after her father arrived home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window tampered with. The girl's mother said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the previous day. A cadaver dog searching the family's Kansas City home indicated a positive ""hit"" for the scent of a body, police said. On that information, Short said law enforcement typically begins such investigations inside the home, and then, if warranted, the inquiry moves outside the family. ""We don't know exactly what happened here, so we need to keep broadening the investigation,"" she said. CNN's Jim Spellman and Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.","NEW: An attorney says she's no longer representing the family of Lisa Irwin .

"(CNN) -- The mother of Derrick Estell -- the inmate who brazenly escaped an Arkansas detention center this week -- was arrested Friday for allegedly helping her son. Glenda Estell, 54, was arrested without incident around 10:40 a.m. at her her home in Hot Springs, Arkansas, according to the arrest report. She is set to appear in court August 13 on one charge of assisting in or furnishing an implement of escape for an inmate. Her son, Derrick, remains at large. According to Garland County Deputy Sheriff Scott Hinojosa, investigators have received tips on Estell's whereabouts in recent days ""but unfortunately, at this point, none of them have been credible."" Surveillance video from Sunday shows Estell talking on the phone and then bolting through a 12-by-30-inch reception window at the Garland County Detention Center while another prisoner distracts deputies. He then ran out the front of the jail -- with a deputy close behind him -- then jumped into a waiting car and sped away. The getaway car was found, abandoned, just a few minutes away but there was no sign of Estell. The vehicle was driven by Tamara Upshaw, who had been staying with Glenda Estell and was with her the day of Derrick's escape, according to the affidavit laying out probable cause for Glenda's arrest. The same document details the Sunday phone call between Glenda and Derrick Estell, while the latter was in the detention center's booking room. At the beginning of the conversation, Glenda Estell says ""it's all good,"" then asks if his shackles are off and questions ""is there two or three in there?"" The video shows Estell suddenly dropping the phone, jumping up on the counter, then escaping. Previous phone conversations between mother and son that ""all have random mentions of the plan for Derrick to escape custody, just at various intervals between normal conversations,"" the arrest affidavit states. Derrick Estell has a lengthy rap sheet, which includes charges of aggravated robbery, breaking and entering and burglary among others.","Derrick Estell escaped an Arkansas detention center on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Loud music pumps through huge speakers, front row guests cheer and a parade of stunning models electrifies the gleaming catwalk -- welcome to Africa Fashion Week London. Currently in its third year, the glamorous event saw dozens of big names and up-and-coming designers from across the continent descending on the UK capital's hip district of Shoreditch to unveil their latest stylish creations. ""Our platform is about promoting emerging and established Africa-inspired designers,"" said Ronke Ademiluyi, founder of the event, held from August 1 to 3. ""The main thing is to bring attention to them, to showcase their creativity to the world so they get more global recognition for what they do and more appreciations for their brands as well."" Vibrant colors . The runways featured designs from countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Kenya and Morocco -- but also from the diaspora, including Britain and the Caribbean. In many ways, the event reaffirmed why Africa-inspired designs are fast catching the eye of the fashion world. Mixing current trends with traditional patterns, more than 60 designers graced the catwalk with a wide array of colorful creations -- everything from show-stopping evening gowns and modern urban casualwear to bold textured prints and chic accessory lines. Glorious colors in the desert: Darfur's fashionable women . Ademiluyi says the continent's fashion today ""represents a fusion of contemporary and African designs"" awash with ""a lot of vibrant colors and tribal trends."" Amongst those giving a modern twist to traditional styles is Nigerian designer Fashola Olayinka with her Lagos-based label ""MOOFA Designs."" Her latest collection, ""Ashake"" is celebrating the ""very powerful and strong women"" who ""turn heads wherever they go to."" ""That's basically what's the collection is about,"" says Olayinka, who started the label about four years ago. ""Women who are very feminine and sexy."" Read this: Congo's designer dandies . The young designer says that despite the existing challenges, such as frequent power cuts, it's very exciting being part of Nigeria's fashion scene right now. ""We work hard and we party hard, so it's been really fun and it's a growing process in Nigeria,"" she says. ""Nigerians like to dress up and a lot of people in Nigeria are now wearing their own fabrics."" Profile boost . But despite the growing interest in African designs, Ademiluyi says that many of the continent's promising talents still find it difficult to break into the mainstream international shows. She says that for many of them, the week is a chance to shine on the international stage. ""A lot of them are talented but they're struggling,"" she says. ""They don't have support from anywhere, so what we do is we support them -- it's an affordable platform for the designers to showcase their talents to the world."" Read this: Taking African colors to America's Deep South . South African fashion artist Steve Mandy agrees. He says that events like this help participants boost their profile both internationally and at home. ""You can meet some really important people here and I have already met some great people here that I think I'll do business with,"" says Durban-based Mandy, known for hand-painting on dresses and t-shirts. ""The other thing is the spin-off in terms of your own image, in terms of our audience back in South Africa -- the fact that you can say that you did African Fashion Week it promotes you and helps your product to gain integrity."" Looking ahead, Ademiluyi says the goal is to hold the event twice a year and also establish a supply platform that would make the designers' creations more accessible to the world. ""For a lot of them, after Africa Fashion Week, that's it,"" she says. ""The clients don't know where to get their brand, so we hope to support the designers a lot more by opening up a distribution outlet.""","Africa Fashion Week London was held from August 1 to 3 .

"(CNN) -- Severely soggy weather soaked the East Coast to the West over the weekend, stranding travelers, washing out roads and claiming two lives. And while the U.S. mainland cleared, Hawaii braced Monday for Tropical Storm Flossie, as the weakening, but still potent system closed on the island chain. Life-threatening flash floods and mud slides are forecast as the storm threatens to dump up to 15 inches of rain, the National Hurricane Center said. On the mainland . In North Carolina, flood waters washed away two people in the state's Piedmont region . The drownings happened Saturday after 4 inches of rain fell over five hours, prompting officials to declare a state of emergency in Catawba County. Delilah Lovett, 10, of Charlotte and Juan Alberdi, 48, of Huntersville -- members of different families who were visiting the area together -- were both swimming in what is known as the ""bathtub"" on Wilson's Creek in Caldwell County around 6:15 p.m., the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office said. Rain, which had already stopped, raised Wilson Creek 2 feet above normal levels and created ""very swift currents"" and carried them away, according to a statement from the sheriff's department. Kayakers found Delilah's body nearly an hour after she disappeared, it said. Search and rescue crews found Alberdi on Sunday, about a quarter mile north of where they were first told he went into the water, according to LouAnne Kincaid, a spokeswoman for Caldwell County. In Lincoln County, a swiftwater rescue team saved two people found hanging Sunday onto a tree after their canoe tipped over in Lincolnton, North Carolina, according to emergency mangement spokesman Dion Burleson. Catawba County officials reported 10 swiftwater rescues. Record-setting hit Philadelphia International Airport, dumping nearly 8 inches of rain in just 6 hours. The storm knocked out power to parts of the airport, leaving some folks in the dark. At least 33 roads in Catawba and Lincoln counties will remain closed on a long-term basis due to storm damage, officials said. Out West . The heavy rains inundated area interstates, leaving cars stranded and traffic backed up for miles. It was more of the same out West as heavy rain mixed with hail pounded the Las Vegas area. The system also triggered a flash flood near the Grand Canyon, flipping a tour bus on its side and sweeping it 300 yards downstream. All 33 passengers crawled out a window to safety. In Hawaii . Tropical Storm Flossie weakened but still brought the treat of torrential rains to the Hawaiian islands on Monday. The storm, with 45 mph winds, prompted officials to close beaches, backcountry trails and some government offices. Tropical storm warnings were up across the islands despite a weakening trend and a slight northwestern shift that could spare parts of the islands a more significant dousing.

The death toll across six states includes another nine in other parts of North Carolina; four in Virginia; seven in Alabama, two in Oklahoma, seven in Arkansas and one in Mississippi. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center said it received reports of at least 230 tornadoes across the region during the past three days, though some of those reports were likely sightings of the same twister. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell declared a state of emergency ""to direct all possible resources towards responding to this event.""

CNN affiliate WTVD broadcast images of damaged homes and vehicles in Smithfield, North Carolina, as local residents and emergency workers surveyed the damage. Gov. Bev Perdue declared a state of emergency for the entire state, according to the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management. ""We've been assured we'll have whatever federal support we'll need,"" Perdue told reporters late Saturday. The governor said that as of late Saturday, the number of storm-related power outages had dropped from 250,000 to 143,000. In South Carolina, a tornado cut through Berkeley County, destroying a church and injuring six people, the weather service said. Meanwhile, emergency crews in Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama worked to assess the damage after the storm system moved north through the Carolinas and up into southern Virginia. iReport photos: Lightning strike in Alabama | More . In Virginia, three Gloucester County residents died and 64 suffered injuries from the fast-moving storms Saturday, according to Bob Spieldenner, director of public affairs for the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. A tornado also ripped the roof off a school in the county, felled trees that blocked multiple roads and severed power lines, leaving 9,300 people without electricity, according to Spieldenner. In the Shenandoah Valley, in the western part of the state, a child died after being swept away in a flash flood, according to the National Weather Service. Spieldenner said authorities rescued another flood victim, but a third is missing. The storms were the latest in a round of severe weather that has hit parts of the Midwest and South since Thursday. They left a trail of downed trees and power lines, scattered cars and crushed homes as it moved east and then turned north.

"(CNN) -- English Premier League grounds are noted for their passionate atmosphere and fans sometimes overstep the boundaries of public decency. In the task of adjudicating just what is and isn't acceptable to say at a football game, leading English Premier League club Liverpool has issued a list of banned words to its employees in its efforts to rid football of discriminatory behavior. The list of offensive words relates to race and religion, sexual orientation, gender and disability and was circulated to members of Liverpool's staff as part of a longer presentation, one page of which was leaked on the internet. ""The club wishes to eradicate any form of discrimination or discriminatory behavior both on and off the football pitch,"" reads the leaked document, which Liverpool confirmed was accurate. ""It's important to understand the context of what's being said, but here are examples of words worth listening out for which are usually offensive and the club consider unacceptable."" The list included terms such as ""n****r"", ""queen"", ""don't be a woman,"" ""cripple"" as well as ""princess""and ""man up"". ""The list -- which is accurate -- was part of a larger, private education program that is designed to teach our employees to recognize any and all forms of discrimination on the grounds, on and off the pitch,"" a Liverpool spokesman told CNN. ""As it was part of a private presentation, LFC cannot pass you on a copy."" The guidelines have has not been reportedly issued to Liverpool players because they receive separate instructions from the Football Association. The document prompted much discussion on social networking site Twitter with Guardian journalist Barney Ronay writing: ""Catching up with this Liverpool story. I see ""lady-boy"" appears under both Gender and Sexual Orientation but ""she-man"" is only under Gender. Typical anti-she man bias."" English football has been blighted by a series of racism scandals in recent years. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches and fined £40,000 in 2011 after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. The club was heavily criticized for its defense of Suarez, with the team and then manager Kenny Dalglish wearing t-shirts in support of the Uruguayan before a Premier League match against Wigan Athletic. In September 2012 former England captain John Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 for a racist slur aimed at Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Terry also faced a criminal trial over the allegations, after which he was found not guilty. Meanwhile, English anti-racism organization Kick It Out, which this year marks 20 years of battling discrimination, has launched a smart phone app which allows fans to report incidents of racism at matches. ""It gives football fans the opportunity to report a racist incident if someone is causing a nuisance in their vicinity or trying to spoil their entertainment,"" former England and Tottenham Hotspur winger and Kick It Out trustee Garth Crooks told CNN. ""For the first time, certainly as long as I've been in football, a football fan can actually complain anonymously about someone being a racial nuisance. ""Now we're not saying that person is a racist, but they're using racist language and it deserves to be reported. The app allows you to do that. It's the perfect tool."" Crooks also hailed the work done by Kick It Out over the last two decades. ""I think it's been very successful,"" he added. ""We've moved from the days where abuse was common place in football and it was embarrassing for all concerned, to a place where the fans have pretty much taken control of the situation. ""They are much more determined to not be sitting in a controlled environment listening to their heroes being abused. ""We have CCTV monitoring areas of the football grounds to make sure that people behave. Managers and players are also involved to try and ensure that, when people play football, it's a comfortable working environment.""","Liverpool issue a list of banned discriminatory terms to employees .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- American humorist Will Rogers once said, ""I'm not a member of any organized political party. I'm a Democrat."" The old saying goes that, come election time, Republicans fall in line and Democrats fall apart. The tradition in the GOP has been that, if you ran for president and came up short -- Ronald Reagan in 1976, George H.W. Bush in 1980, John McCain in 2000, Mitt Romney in 2008 -- next time, it would be your turn. Among Democrats, it was a free-for-all. Hillary Clinton was thought to have a lock on the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, but Barack Obama had other ideas. That's how it has long been in our politics. Republicans were the party of order, Democrats were prone to chaos. No more. In 2013, the Democrats seem pretty well organized. All of them eyeing the presidency -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, et al. -- seem to be waiting to see what Hillary Clinton will do in 2016 before announcing their intentions. Last week, in Washington, Clinton even had a cordial lunch with an old friend who she ran against once and may run against once more -- Vice President Joe Biden. Five things we're learning from Christie-Paul spat . Meanwhile, Republicans are engaged in a series of messy food fights. You have Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas vs. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida over immigration; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vs. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky over domestic surveillance and the cost of preventing terrorism; Paul vs. Sen. John McCain of Arizona over whether the Kentucky senator would -- if he ran for president -- be preferable to Hillary Clinton; Rubio vs. the GOP establishment over defunding Obamacare; and Cruz vs. well, just about everybody over just about everything. The result is a battle royal with four or five slugfests going on at once. A few of them stick out as noteworthy. Rubio poked at fellow Republicans -- particularly those in the establishment -- for not being tougher on President Barack Obama's top domestic accomplishment, asking: ""If we're not willing to fight on Obamacare, what issue are we willing to fight on?"" Cruz continued that theme when -- in comments that got him in hot water with liberals and conservatives -- he accused fellow Republicans of being part of a ""surrender caucus"" because of their reluctance to buck the tide. And at least one GOP scuffle -- the one between Christie and Paul -- is downright nasty. Christie started it when he criticized Paul's vocal opposition to warrantless federal surveillance programs, saying it hurt efforts to thwart terrorism. He sanctimoniously invited opponents to ""come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation."" Paul wasn't in the mood for a lecture. He dismissed the attacks from Christie as ""kind of cheap and sad"" and suggested that if the governor ""cared about protecting this country, maybe he wouldn't be in this 'give me, give me, give me all of the money' (mindset) that you have in Washington."" Christie wasn't in the mood to be scolded. He suggested Paul ""start cutting the pork barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky."" Although, Christie said, he doubted that would happen because ""most Washington politicians only care about bringing home the bacon so that they can get re-elected."" Then Paul went for the knockout. ""This is the king of bacon talking about bacon,"" he said incredulously during an interview on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" He clarified: ""You know, we have two military bases in Kentucky. What does he want to do, shut down military bases in Kentucky?"" I guarantee that given Christie's struggle to lose weight, most Americans won't think of military bases when they hear that a fellow Republican dubbed him ""the king of bacon."" What's a food fight without bacon flying through the air? Some of this conflict was inevitable. Politics is a contact sport, and it always has been. This is how parties behave when they're out of power and looking for a way to get back in. It's also how politicians behave when -- after their party suffers a string of losses -- they try to whip up the special sauce that allows them to finally rack up a victory. Democrats did the same thing after losing three presidential elections in a row -- 1980, 1984, 1988. Along came a handsome, young governor from Arkansas with a staggering amount of ambition, and he decided that the way to break the curse was to market himself as a ""new Democrat,"" which we came to understand meant more pragmatic and more moderate. Still, what we're seeing from Republicans isn't just politics as usual. There is nothing wrong with a little conflict and soul-searching to recalibrate what a party stands for between elections. But this has gotten awfully rough. Warring parties could find it hard to forgive and forget when they need to close ranks against the Democrats. This isn't like the political tussles of old. The elbows are sharper. The attacks more personal. The insults more pointed. It's not just that these folks disagree with someone's ideas and tactics; in some cases, it's clear that they really don't like that person. So when they butt heads, the goal isn't just to defeat their opponent but to destroy him. If this keeps up, don't be surprised if voters decide in 2016 to keep these kindergarteners in their sandbox and far away from the White House. As well they should.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- I recently stumbled on a Nigerians For Obama Twitter handle, launched on October 10 this year. ""We nigerians in American (sic) want to tell obama that we have got his back,"" the inaugural tweet read. There's nothing surprising about that -- after all, Barack Obama, born of an African man, is ""our son."" The story of ""Obamagic"" goes back four years, when it emerged that a black man actually stood a chance of becoming the president of the most powerful country in the world. Here, the boss of the stock exchange launched an ""Africans for Obama"" group (never mind that she probably meant to say ""Billionaire Nigerians for Obama"") and organised a fund-raising dinner that amassed $600,000 for the Democratic candidate. Postcard: Why Berliners, U.S. are kindred spirits . There was only one snag; no one had taken the time to find out what American campaign financing laws had to say about such a move. The Obama campaign wasn't allowed to receive the money, and Nigeria 's anti-graft agency stepped in to probe the fundraising. For those who couldn't say ""Yes we can"" with their checkbooks, there was Facebook which, back then, was a relatively new phenomenon in Nigeria. We could join the Americans and the rest of the world to share our opinions about the son of Africa on his way to the White House. Just a year after Nigeria's 2007 general elections -- which brought Umar Yar'Adua to power in a election derided by some as a ""charade"" -- Obama's race to the White House was a chance for Nigerians to vicariously participate in a political process that appeared transparent and was no doubt inspiring; not to mention the amusement of indulging in debates about whether things would've been different had Barack Obama, Sr. been Nigerian and not Kenyan. Map: The world weighs in on the U.S. election . Four years later, a lot has changed. The novelty of 2008 has worn off, and many Nigerians appear to have moved on. Much of the energy that in 2008 went into the U.S. elections has since found an outlet in our own electoral processes. As I wrote this piece one of the prominent things on my Twitter timeline was a running commentary on the live broadcast of the governorship debate in Nigeria's Ondo State, where elections are due this weekend. A scenario like this was highly unlikely four years ago. We also now have our own ""Facebook President"" -- Goodluck Jonathan announced his decision to run for president on Facebook, and is today one of the world's most ""liked"" heads of state on the social networking site (he has actually been called ""Nigeria's Obama."") It is this homegrown excitement that the Obama-Romney contest now has to compete against. I've been randomly asking friends if they stayed up to watch the first presidential debate. While most respondents didn't, as the debate took place at 3:00 a.m. here, a U.S. debate is just the sort of thing -- like the Academy Awards or English Premier League matches -- that would have set Twitter afire in Lagos. Postcard: Obama's 'hope' a mirage for hostile Pakistanis . I awoke the next morning to find a BlackBerry message from a friend to a group of 16 of us. He'd sent it during the debate, asking if anyone was up. When I saw it the next morning, I panicked slightly, wondering what emergency had arisen overnight. It turned out there'd been no emergency; he simply wanted to know if anyone else was watching. Only one other member of the group was awake at that time. Lawyer and Big Brother Nigeria alumnus Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, another of my friends who watched that first debate, told me he did so as a ""cynic"", merely for an opportunity to see Barack Obama ""challenged"" after a lackluster first term. Linda Ikeji, Nigeria's best-known entertainment blogger, has been weighing in on the U.S. presidential debates. In response to her post asking readers if they watched the first debate, and if it ""harm[ed]"" Obama, a comment described the U.S. president as ""simply clueless"" -- an interesting choice when one considers that ""clueless"" is one of the most widely used epithets used to describe President Jonathan. Postcard: War-scarred Baghdad has little faith in election . Perhaps we're seeing in Obama a reflection of our own president: swift dissipation of a hope founded largely on a campaign charged with personal stories; a case of soaring soapbox poetry swiftly replaced by the clunky prose of presidential politics. Yet none of the Nigerian love Obama may have lost appears to have found its way to Mr. Romney. Blogger Ikeji's post about the second debate clearly demonstrates that the fondness for Mr. Obama in these parts is instinctive. In the last couple of days I've seen friends on social media tickled by the idea of a ""Myth Romney."" Mitt's faith isn't a big help to him here either, in a country where fervent Pentecostals remain wary of Mormons (of whom there are roughly 100,000 in Nigeria today). Postcard: Obama, Romney ignore Afghans at own peril . Still, we're nowhere near the 2008 levels of U.S. election enthusiasm. If the Africans for Obama dinner was the high point of 2008, the high point of the 2012 U.S. presidential season in Nigeria was the controversy around the presence of opposition party leader Bola Tinubu at the Democratic National Convention. Initial reports quoted his team as saying he was specially invited by Obama --- but it quickly emerged that Tinubu did not receive any special invitation, and his party reportedly said he'd paid a fee to attend. For days national media feasted on the story and the ruling People's Democratic Party seized its chance to pillory the opposition Action Congress of Nigeria, describing it as ""founded on fraud and deceit."" Postcard: Greeks fear what could follow U.S. election . That sort of name-calling, as opposed to debates around manifesto highlights, lies at the heart of Nigerian politics. 2015 might actually end up being the first Nigerian general election in recent history in which ""issues"" -- power, state subsidies, taxation, roads, etc. -- will carry the day. Just maybe. Since we're not conditioned to judging candidates on the strength or otherwise of their beliefs in health insurance or taxation or foreign policy, it's easy to tune off when the American elections slide into that territory. ""A lot of Nigerians don't understand the politics or economy of America ,"" says journalist Olumide Iyanda, Saturday Editor at the Lagos-based Independent Newspapers. ""It's the soap opera that Nigerians are interested in, not the issues.""","In 2008, Nigerians were inspired by Barack Obama's run for the U.S. presidency .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney -- who was aboard a ship the Israeli navy intercepted this week -- is in a detention center and will be returned to the United States, the U.S. Embassy said. Former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Georgia, refuses to sign Israeli deportation papers, the U.S. Embassy says. McKinney was among those on a ship that the Israeli Defense Forces said violated an Israeli blockade and crossed into Gazan waters on Tuesday. The Israeli navy gained control of the ship and took McKinney and about 20 people into custody, said the Free Gaza Movement, a human rights group that sent the ship. The group said the ship, which it calls Spirit of Humanity, was carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza. McKinney served six terms in the House of Representatives as a Democrat from Georgia and was the Green Party's 2008 presidential nominee. The ex-lawmaker is in the Givon immigration detention center in the central Israeli city of Ramle, the U.S. Embassy said. She has been given deportation papers but has refused to sign them, the embassy said. She will be held for three more days, assuming she does not sign the papers, and then will be sent back to the United States, the embassy added. The location of others taken into custody was not immediately known. The IDF said the ship, which it called the Arion, had been warned while at sea that it would not be allowed to enter Gazan waters ""because of security risks in the area and the existing naval blockade."" The IDF said the cargo boat disregarded all warnings and entered Gazan coastal waters. An Israeli navy force intercepted, boarded and took control of the vessel, directing it toward Ashdod, Israel, the IDF said. The boat's crew would ""be handed over to the proper authorities,"" the military said. Without naming who was on the boat, the IDF confirmed that the incident was the same detailed by the Free Gaza Movement. According to the Free Gaza group, McKinney said, ""This is an outrageous violation of international law against us. Our boat was not in Israeli waters, and we were on a human rights mission to the Gaza Strip"" before authorities confiscated cell phones. Also aboard was Mairead Maguire, who co-founded a group that worked for peace in Northern Ireland. Maguire and co-founder Betty Williams received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 for their work. Free Gaza said the voyage is the eighth such trip the group has launched. Five succeeded, the group said, but the Israeli military stopped attempts in January 2008 and December.","Ex-U.S. Rep.

"(CNN) -- In an earthshaking 1965 speech to Congress and to the nation, President Lyndon Johnson spoke directly to the sinister forces that had restricted black Americans' right to vote across the South -- laying out the goals of the Voting Rights Act in the form of a command to this shameful cabal. ""Open your polling places to all your people. Allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin. Extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land,"" Johnson thundered. ""There is no constitutional issue here. The command of the Constitution is plain."" The speech stirred the country, moved the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to tears and secured this essential law's passage. Today, if President Barack Obama wants to save the Voting Rights Act following Tuesday's shameful Supreme Court ruling, then he faces an even bigger challenge than Johnson did: He's got to convince a much more hostile Congress that the act is worth saving. Hanging in the balance is the very foundation of American civil rights law. On Tuesday, nearly 50 years after Johnson's historic speech, the five conservative members of the Supreme Court eviscerated the Voting Rights Act in a single stroke. Why? According to the majority opinion, apparently it's because the discriminatory anti-voter rules the act prohibits aren't as much of a problem as they were before the law was passed. If you're trying to think up a way to illustrate how completely nuts that is, don't worry, because Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg already put it best in her dissent. Striking down this essential part of the act, Ginsburg wrote, ""is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."" Opinion: How segregation got busted . Of course, Johnson was right in 1965, and he's just as right today. These protections are vital and necessary. There is no right more sacrosanct to the very foundations of our nation than the right to vote, and threats to equal voting loom every time we turn a blind eye. Constant vigilance is required to safeguard it, and for half a century the Voting Rights Act was a watchful guardian. But now that Section 5's ""pre-clearance"" formula has been made irrelevant, it falls to Congress to fix it. Don't expect the conservative-controlled House of Representatives to jump at the chance though. Just last year, during the 2012 election cycle, Republican elected officials in states across the country pushed deeply hostile voter ID laws that disproportionately limit minority voters. Sometimes, the Republicans were even explicit that the purpose of these laws was to put victories in the ""R"" column. And all that took place with a full and complete Voting Rights Act still on the books. Veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost . Now it's up to Obama to make a new case for a new Voting Rights Act. Of course, there's nothing partisan about equality in the ballot box. The act's great virtue is that it barred discrimination no matter which way it was directed. It was an equal opportunity shield from injustice -- protecting you no matter who you voted for or what you looked like. It is a crying shame that the Supreme Court left a key part of Johnson's legacy in tatters. But today, Obama -- and every fair-minded American -- should look to the spirit of Johnson and King and pass a new Voting Rights Act that will stand the test of time. We can't wait. Election Day is just around the corner.

"(CNN) -- WARNING: Contains strong language . In an episode of the cartoon television series South Park -- ""Le Petit Tourette"" -- one of its characters, Cartman, overhears a child with Tourette's syndrome swearing. Thinking that this is the best excuse ever for being able to swear and be racist without fear of punishment, Cartman proceeds to pretend to have Tourette's. But as the episode progresses what starts out as a funny joke for him soon turns into a Freudian reversal when he can't actually stop saying exactly what is on his mind, leading to him involuntarily reveal that he has touched another boy's penis and has fantasies about one of the girls at school. Read more: What to do about scourge of Web . The recent spate of ""trolling"" on Twitter seem to me to have echoes of this scenario. The trolls are like Cartman -- men (usually, but not exclusively) using the currently chaotic and inefficiently moderated forum of Twitter in much in the same way as Cartman uses Tourette's, as permission to express the forbidden thought -- ""I can say whatever I want!..."" Cartman sings delightedly. ""I've got the golden ticket!"" But there has been a real sense of unhinged mania in the frenetic activity of Twitter ""trolling"" in the past week, which has shown no sign of abating. Caitlin Moran claims that on a bad day she can get up to 50 tweets an hour that are violent or abusive. While no one wants to be on the receiving end of these messages, anyone who writes ""Rape threats? Don't flatter yourself. Call the cops. We'll rape them too. YOU B*TCH! YO P**SY STANK!"" or ridiculous and faintly surreal bomb threats, is certainly not winning at life. Judging from her Twitter feed, for Caroline Criado-Perez it's turned into a full time job, lobbing all those comments back to where they came, reporting and blocking people who only pop up again somewhere else like a maddening whack-a-mole. But this is unsustainable in the long term and the people who are engaging in this kind of behavior are certainly getting off on the attention. As one might expect the general ""troll"" profile in this instance is immature or disenfranchised men with a misogynist agenda. Criado-Perez deserves a medal for taking them on, and especially for exposing the ""don't feed the trolls"" line which has been a convenient way of allowing their hate speak to thrive. But there is more than just a ""report abuse"" function needed to stop this from happening. The sustained nature of these attacks is frightening as is the way in which Twitter has responded. Yes, it's a matter for the police, but there are simply too many of them to arrest everyone and the abusers know this. Read more: Calls for action as female journalists get bomb threats on Twitter . Twitter has been caught on the back foot. First in tolerating it under the fig leaf of freedom of speech (since when has threatening someone with rape or violence been expressing an opinion?), and then by treating the matter with a diffidence only possible in the Rayndian environment of Silicon Valley. That it's taken them so long to respond is indicative of their inability to grasp the seriousness of the situation. But the problem for Twitter is that these people are in danger of turning the platform into the equivalent of a manky, crime ridden shopping center -- full of sketchy types, obscene graffiti and broken street furniture -- and who wants to have a conversation there? The platform technologists have a responsibility to provide a solution, and to start acting like the publishers that they patently are. They have responded, as any company getting bad PR must, but whether this will actually change the atmosphere on Twitter -- as well as misogyny there are serious issues with anti-Semitism and racism too -- remains to be seen. Read more: Twitter updates abuse rules after UK backlash . There is also the sense that this is a backlash against a series of high profile social media-driven campaigns -- not just Caroline Criado-Perez's banknote campaign, but the campaign to tone down lads' mags, to get rid of Page 3 (please, not soon enough), and to do something about the freely available violent pornography on the internet. The so-called ""trolls"" themselves evidently think they are being in some way edgy or humorous -- the kids who never grew out of making fart jokes -- but much like Cartman, given license to say anything, they end up revealing much more about themselves than they ever meant to. In their unhinged attempts at ""humor"" they also expose the discourse of a violent, knee-jerk misogyny abroad in our wider pornified culture, which brings to mind Germaine Greer's famous statement ""women have very little idea how much men hate them."" Well -- thanks to the access to the collective unconscious that is Twitter -- we do now. There is even a suggestion that some of these men are operating in a systematic group way much like online pedophiles, and how long before they act out on one of their hateful fantasies? The more uncomfortable question to answer is why, and what can be done about it. While women wait for Twitter to sort itself out, troll-shaming seems like a good place to start as Mary Beard proved recently when she retweeted abuse saying: ""Sorry about that nasty retweet. But I'm not going to be terrorized."" The Mirror reported that another Twitter user then offered to send Beard the address of the troll's mother -- at which point the troll apologized. We also need to galvanize the men who don't hate women -- as I've always thought Greer's comment was missing the word ""some"" -- guys, we need your help here too. Maybe someone should start a Twitter campaign.

"(CNN) -- Nearly five years after the housing bubble burst, American homeowners are beginning to see signs of relief as housing markets are finally showing signs of recovery. An untold story of this recovery, however, is the extent to which it is fueled by immigration. A new analysis of U.S. Census data by Americas Society/Council of the Americas and Partnership for a New American Economy shows that immigrants have collectively added $3.7 trillion to U.S. housing wealth. And over the last several years, as many families in cities and rural areas from the Sun Belt to Rust Belt have seen their largest personal asset -- the home they live in -- placed in jeopardy, the inflow of immigrants has been a lifeline for them. Take Chicago. The number of U.S.-born Americans residing in Chicago and surrounding Cook County has declined by 900,000 since 1970. Fortunately, the arrival of nearly 600,000 immigrants over the same time period has offset most of that decline -- and most likely kept additional natives from leaving -- blunting what could have been a catastrophe for the local housing market. Similar stories exist all around the country. The U.S. Census data show that in Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, the influx of immigrants between 2000 and 2010 added more than $25,000 to the value of the average home. In Maricopa County, Arizona, which is home to staunch immigration opponent Sheriff Joe Arpaio, immigration added $18,000 to local home prices over the period. Immigrants are a boon for the housing market in three ways. First, their demand for affordable housing renewed the local housing markets. This, coupled with increased demands for locally produced goods and services once they establish themselves, stimulates their neighborhood's economy. Second, and relatedly, as immigrants stimulate economic life in affordable neighborhoods, they attract more U.S.-born people to those neighborhoods, further bolstering home values. For every 1,000 immigrants who move to a county, 250 U.S.-born people eventually follow, drawn by the new economic opportunities that have been created. Third, immigrants help stabilize neighborhoods that have gone into decline, helping these previously blighted neighborhoods become viable alternatives for middle- and working-class Americans. Importantly, because immigrants tend to gravitate to areas with cheaper housing costs, they create wealth in the housing market without contributing to the pricing out of the middle class from more desirable neighborhoods, especially in large metropolitan areas. Immigrants and the housing market is just one chapter in the larger story of their role in helping our economy to grow. In health care, for example, the en masse retirement of Baby Boomers creates increased demand for professionals ranging from physicians and surgeons to home health aides. Immigrants are critical for taking care of our elderly, and for filling the jobs needed to sustain our overall health care industry. The same holds true in housing. Because immigrants move into areas where housing is cheaper and neighborhoods are more on the edge, they revitalize those neighborhoods. We've seen that across New York City, from Washington Heights in Northern Manhattan to Flushing and Corona in Queens to Sunset Park in Brooklyn. Encouraging the stability and growth of the U.S. housing market is a fundamental aspect of ensuring a solid economy. So is ensuring U.S. industries have access to a productive, diverse and flexible workforce with the right skills to grow and prosper. Immigration is essential to achieving both of these goals and is thus essential to the future of the United States. With the future of immigration reform in the hands of the House of Representatives, this new research gives added momentum for why we need a bipartisan agreement that reflects many of the basic compromises of the Senate bill. As a country we cannot afford to refuse to modernize and reform our immigration system. Turning away those who could help us build a stronger and more dynamic community and nation would be blind to our economic needs. Now is the time for immigration reform.

"London (CNN) -- Vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days, transforming drab urban facades into vibrant jungles of color. These lush expanses have found their way onto the walls -- both inside and out -- on numerous sites in recent years revitalizing public buildings, hotels, offices and even a multi-storey car park in Netherlands. Aside from their pleasing aesthetic qualities, vertical gardens could also deliver more practical benefits says Mark Laurence, creative director at Biotecture, a UK company who design and build green walls. ""The market is rapidly moving into looking at how they can provide eco-system services and green infrastructures for urban environments,"" Laurence said. Their modular hydroponic system -- where plants sit in a soil-free set up with nutrients delivered through irrigation channels -- can be retrofitted to just about any wall. A recent creation erected on the side of Edgware Road Underground station in central London is hoping to improve air quality. The 200-square meter wall near Marylebone Road -- one of the UK capital's grimiest thoroughfares -- is being monitored by Imperial College, London. ""They have taken initial samples and going at regular intervals to take leaf samples. Then they wash these leaf samples to see how much particulate matter has adhered to the leaves,"" said Laurence. The leaves also have an electrostatic charge that also attracts particles. ""A researcher I was speaking to recently reckons green walls in urban canyon environments (areas where walls are higher than the width of the road separating them) are more effective than trees at collecting particles because the way the wind eddies around and then moves down the wall,"" Laurence said. Some believe that in less polluted areas, green walls could be employed to grow food, which could aid urban food security. Biotecture have successfully trialled a wall which grew 45 varieties of vegetable. Furthermore, there's nothing stopping people building their own, more basic green walls at home, Laurence says. There are various systems for DIY constructions with most requiring a compost-based system, he says, but homemade hydroponic systems can be made using plastic bottles. All you need is irrigation and adequate light.","Green walls turn dreary urban facades into vertical banks of color .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's August, the dog days of summer, and President Barack Obama and Congress are making a break from the nation's capital. The president heads West for a quick trip on the economy that includes a visit with Jay Leno, while federal lawmakers begin their five-week summer recess. Mitt Romney, a couple men who might have hopes of being the next Republican presidential nominee, and a first-term congressman from Arkansas also will be political stories in the week ahead. 1. Taking it to the states . While lawmakers may have left Washington for the sticky month of August, their political battles aren't taking a rest. The sniping over Obamacare, immigration and the budget is only set to amplify as outside groups hit states to rally supporters behind their causes. Like August 2009, when rowdy town halls across the country helped fuel the burgeoning tea party movement, health care will provide conservative activists with a rallying cry for smaller government and less federal spending -- though this time around, Obamacare supporters are also getting into the town hall business. Obamacare battle heads to states . Organizing for Action, the advocacy group formed from the remnants of Obama's presidential campaign, will get started Sunday with community events and house parties pegged to the president's 52nd birthday. The Obamacare rallies, part of the group's ""Action August"" initiative, are designed to counter conservatives who are also darting across the country to push against the president's sweeping health care law. While the 2009 rallies loudly pushed elected officials to reject the president's plans, conservative events this year will advocate defunding the law, which was enacted in 2010 and deemed constitutional last summer by the Supreme Court. Some conservative lawmakers -- including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rep. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah -- are using impending budget battles as leverage, vowing to oppose any measure that provides funding for the federal government that includes funding for the health care law. The measure funding the government expires September 30, setting up another Capitol Hill budget battle between Republicans and the White House. Other Republicans, however, have voiced opposition to threatening a government shutdown in order to gut the health care law. Boehner's juggling act: Killing Obamacare and avoiding shutdown . Other groups hitting the road: the anti-Obamacare Tea Party Patriots, ForAmerica and Americans for Prosperity; and the pro-Obamacare Americans United for Change and Protect your Care. 2. Obama heads West . With economic speeches in Illinois, Missouri, Florida and Tennessee under his belt, Obama heads west Tuesday to Arizona, this time to talk housing in a market that's seeing recovery after home prices plummeted. Phoenix was one of the worst hit areas during the housing crisis, seeing home prices drop more than 50% between 2006 and 2011. But things are looking up -- a closely watched index out this week showed home prices there were up more than 20% from a year ago. CNNMoney.com: Home prices keep soaring . But homeownership around the nation is still at record lows, and according to a report this week from a federal watchdog, borrowers who received help through the government's main foreclosure prevention program are re-defaulting on their mortgages at alarming rates. ""In Arizona, the president will lay out his plan to continue to help responsible homeowners and those Americans who seek to own their own homes as another cornerstone of how we can strengthen the middle class in America,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said this week. The speech is a continuation of the president's push to turn back to the economy and jobs, which Americans still rate as their top issues in public polling. Republicans have largely been skeptical of the new effort, casting it as yet another ""pivot"" that hasn't resulted in any new proposals. While out West, the president will also drop in on Jay Leno, taping an appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" on Tuesday. He'll also visit servicemen and women at southern California's Camp Pendleton. 3. He's back! Mitt Romney is attending his first political fundraiser since he lost last November's presidential election. The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP nominee will be the headliner at a New Hampshire Republican Party reception and fundraiser. The event will take place on Tuesday in the Granite State's lakes region, near Romney's vacation home in Wolfeboro, along Lake Winnipesaukee. The New Hampshire Republican Party told CNN that general admission tickets for the event are sold out. ""The dinner will give Romney's many local supporters in New Hampshire a chance to see him again,"" Ryan Williams, an adviser to the New Hampshire GOP who worked on the Romney campaign, told CNN. Was Mitt Romney right about Detroit and Russia? Following November's election loss, Romney spent much of his time out of the public eye, but he recently re-entered the spotlight, holding a multiday conference in Park City, Utah, that featured several prospective 2016 presidential candidates and other national leaders, as well as some of the GOP's major donors. 4. Is the next race already under way? Two men who might aspire to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2016 head to -- you guessed it -- Iowa at the end of the week. Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who battled Romney deep into last year's GOP primaries, and freshman Sen. Ted Cruz will have prominent speaking roles at the 2013 Family Leadership Summit. The event's being put on by the Family Leader, a group that's influential with social conservatives in Iowa. Social conservative voters are a key constituency among Hawkeye State Republicans, and Iowa's caucuses lead off the presidential primary and caucus calendar. Santorum is well known and respected among social conservatives. Cruz, who was elected to the Senate last year thanks to strong support from tea party and other grassroots conservatives, is fast becoming a rising star on the right. Also speaking at the gathering: Donald Trump, who once again might be flirting with running for president. 5. Game on in crucial Senate battle . Get ready for what could be another crucial and bruising 2014 Senate battle, this time in Arkansas, which could ultimately decide whether the Democrats keep control of the chamber. Republican Rep. Tom Cotton is expected to announce Tuesday that he's running against incumbent two-term U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor, who is considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election next year. Cotton, who served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is considered a rising star in the GOP and is a favorite of many neoconservatives. The representative, who was just elected to Congress this past November, has been a frequent guest on cable news channels, including CNN. Next year the Democrats will try to maintain their majority in the Senate, where they hold a 54-46 edge (including two independents who caucus with the party) over the GOP. They hope to expand that to 55-45 following October's special Senate election in New Jersey, which they are favored to win. But they most likely will be defending 21 of 35 seats up for grabs in November 2014.","Advocacy about Obamacare is planned by liberals and conservatives .

"Genetic test predicts brain aging disorders such as Lou Gehrig's disease and Parkinson's. A Mayo Clinic study, announced in January 2008, details an unprecedented method to predict brain aging disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, called ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Investigators identified several gene mutations that predicted which people are at high risk for ALS and Parkinson's, which afflicts a million Americans. People with one set of genetic mutations were 2,000 times more likely than normal to develop ALS. Those with the other set are 400 times more likely than normal to suffer from Parkinson's disease. Researchers say this approach may be used to predict other complex diseases such as Alzheimer's, strokes, diabetes and cancer. They say, for example, if a test is developed that predicts someone is at high risk for diabetes, that person can change his or her behavior through exercise and diet to prevent the disease. What does this mean for people who will get these diseases? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent: You can't prevent diseases like Parkinson's or ALS. But researchers hope that by showing there are gene mutations that cause these brain diseases, new drugs will be created to prevent them. Brain cells go from the brain and travel down to the end of the spinal cord. This pathway tells these brain cells which direction to go in the body. But if something goes wrong and there is a mistake in where the cells are told to go, this is enough to cause a disease. Let's say the cell travels from the brain, but stops at the shoulders or at the chest -- this could cause ALS or Parkinson's. Keep in mind that these are devastating conditions. One million Americans have Parkinson's, which causes shakes, stiffness and slow movement. ALS, which causes muscles to waste away and leaves patients totally paralyzed, affects 30,000 people in the U.S. How accurate were they in predicting who could get ALS and Parkinson's? Gupta: Very accurate. More than 90 percent of the time, researchers correctly predicted who would get ALS or Parkinson's. They were also able to predict the age when people would get these diseases with 85 percent accuracy. There isn't a way to prevent these diseases, but this research could be used as a model to develop other tests that could predict diseases such as cancer, diabetes and strokes. This could actually end up saving lives. Let's say someone finds out they're at high risk of getting diabetes. They could start eating healthy and exercising more to delay or prevent the disease. What are the implications of this? Gupta: It will allow other people to make similar tests for a lot of other diseases in record time. It's possible they could make a simple blood test that tells people at birth what diseases they're likely to get. For example, if you see that someone is likely to get ADHD, you can start getting that kid special schooling. Let's say another person is at high risk for prostate cancer. You can start getting them tested early, at age 30.","This new method of genetic testing can help determine who'll get ALS, Parkinson's and one day may lead to tests that can predict other diseases ."
"(CNN) -- Apple, that icon of left-leaning Silicon Valley whose board of directors includes former Democratic Vice President Al Gore, is really a symbol of the Republican Party. Rivals Google and Samsung, meanwhile, are more like Democrats. Got that? This analysis comes courtesy of Rush Limbaugh, the conservative talk-show host, who ventured into the unfamiliar world of tech punditry last week. On his radio show Friday, Limbaugh went on a curious rant about how tech bloggers are overrun with liberals who hate Apple -- not unlike, in his view, how the mainstream (translation: left-wing) media covers the GOP. ""I would venture to say that 9 out of 10 bloggers writing high-tech hate Apple. Apple is the equivalent of the Republicans on these blogs, and Google, Android, and Samsung are the equivalent of the Democrats. They're perfect, they can't do anything wrong, they're ideal, and everybody hates Apple,"" he said, according to a transcript posted on his website. Limbaugh added this opinion of tech bloggers: ""I'd say most of them vote Democrat. Most of them think they're young and hip, pop culture hip. That's high-tech, of course it would be. Republicans to them are probably aliens from Mars, racists, sexists, bigot homophobes."" The right-wing commentator went on to accuse pro-Google, pro-Samsung bloggers of ""faking data, faking news to make it look bad for Apple when it really isn't."" He added that a small minority of pro-Apple bloggers are starting to write about this ""media bias,"" even though ""they don't understand it."" Limbaugh offered no explanation for why so-called liberal bloggers would favor Google and Samsung over Apple. His comments prompted some head-scratching among tech reporters who questioned Limbaugh's knowledge of the tech-media landscape. ""Yes, there are certain bloggers who obviously favor one company or another,"" wrote Chris Matyszczyk for CNET. ""But the idea that 9 out of 10 bloggers regularly toss rancid red tomatoes at Apple, while Tim Cook is trapped in the stocks and pleading for his life, seems a trifle stretched."" Others took issue with Limbaugh comparing Apple to the Republican Party. While Apple has evolved from a scrappy, counterculture startup into a wealthy corporation that's a darling of Wall Street, it's been more historically aligned with left-leaning causes. Its late co-founder, Steve Jobs, often expressed support for Democratic candidates. And still others poked fun at Limbaugh's comment, in describing the tech sites he reads, that ""some of these blogs have actual websites."" ""I dunno about anyone else, but when I want a real nuanced take on the tech industry, I go to Limbaugh,"" said Henry Tsay on Twitter. ""Rush Limbaugh says that Apple is like the Republican Party. That grinding sound you hear is coming from Steve Jobs' grave,"" added Twitter user Brand Gamblin. When asked by a listener to identify which tech sites and bloggers he was talking about, Limbaugh declined. ""Folks, I've thought about it, and there's nothing to be gained by it. If I call 'em out, all they're gonna do is get happy that I'm giving them attention ... it's not gonna change them,"" he said. ""They don't need more readers. The more readers they have, the more damage they would do.""","Rush Limbaugh says ""9 out of 10 bloggers writing high-tech hate Apple""

"(CNN) -- The retrial of Egypt's former president, Hosni Mubarak, on charges of killing protesters during the country's 2011 revolution and profiteering resumed Saturday before being adjourned until next month. Mubarak was forced from office in February 2011 following two weeks of mass street protests. Following a lengthy trial, he and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters' killings. After appealing their convictions, they were granted a new trial early this year. Six of Mubarak's former security aides last year were acquitted of charges related to the killings, and Mubarak's two sons -- Gamal and Alaa -- were acquitted of corruption charges. But they, too, were ordered to be retried after President Mohamed Morsy, himself ousted this week, ordered a new investigation last year. Mubarak and the other defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges. Mubarak was present in court Saturday for the fourth session of the retrial, wearing his signature sunglasses. He made his first court appearance in May. The retrial has been adjourned until August 17, the prosecution said in a statement. A public prosecutor sent Mubarak -- who spent months detained in a military hospital -- back to prison in April. Mubarak's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had maintained that he was physically unfit to stand trial. Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year. He is also charged with seizing public funds and misusing political influence. He also faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial. Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value. The ousted autocratic leader spent three decades in charge of Egypt, the most populous Arab country. Journalist Adam Makary contributed to this report.","NEW: The retrial of former President Hosni Mubarak is adjourned until mid-August .

"(CNN) -- People upset at George Zimmerman's acquittal are calling for awarding various new powers to prosecutors at the expense of protections for criminal defendants. Maybe this would make it easier to hang a rap on some future Zimmerman. But it also would have an effect that its backers probably don't intend: increasing the number of persons convicted and sent to prison. As part of that effect, more young black men -- as well as more members of other groups -- will end up behind bars. On Twitter and Facebook, many people have expressed frustration with the conviction standard of ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" which the state of Florida was unable to overcome. Couldn't we lower it? Others hoped prosecutors could appeal the verdict (right now, they can't; an acquittal is final). To change either of these basic features of our judicial system, we'd have to overturn the Supreme Court's settled view of the Bill of Rights or amend the U.S. Constitution itself. And what would happen if we did? Convictions would rise, and the nation's outlandishly large and disproportionately black prison rolls would swell yet further. Or consider the popular notion of retrying Zimmerman on federal charges. Under our Constitution, even serious crimes such as murder are traditionally offenses under state law only. In a controversial 1959 opinion, Bartkus v. Illinois, the Supreme Court ruled that consecutive prosecutions under state and federal law do not violate the Constitution's ban on double jeopardy. Interestingly, that was the view of the court's five more conservative justices. The dissenters, who warned eloquently of the dangers of letting government try people twice for the same conduct, were the four liberals: Earl Warren, William Douglas, Hugo Black and William Brennan. For many years thereafter, such prosecutions were a rare exception. Occasionally they were of national note, as when a Jim Crow authority would refuse to prosecute a white-on-black crime. Only with the Rodney King case in California in 1993 did anyone seriously propose giving prosecutors a second bite at the apple after a state prosecution pursued in good faith before an ordinary jury ended in an unpopular acquittal. If the floodgates now open, how long before we see federal enforcers begin to second-guess state-court acquittals in, say, drug cases? Others call for narrowing self-defense rights, though the Zimmerman case wound up being tried under pretty much the same self-defense standard that prevails in the great majority of states. Florida's so-called ""stand your ground"" law, which did away with the ""duty to retreat,"" was ignored by both prosecution and defense, and the jury appeared to accept Zimmerman's contention that retreat was not an option for him once the altercation began. A key constituency seeking to roll back stand your ground in the Florida legislature is prosecutors, whose interests just might not be fully congruent with those of the people they prosecute. Although critics insist that stand your ground leads to racially disparate effects, the Tampa Bay Times, a paper that has been highly critical of the law, concedes its in-depth investigation ""found no obvious bias in how black defendants have been treated"" under the law. It also quoted Alfreda Coward, a black Fort Lauderdale lawyer ""whose clients are mostly black men,"" as saying it had sometimes worked to the advantage of her clients facing charges over altercations. ""Let's be clear,"" Coward told the paper, ""this law was not designed for the protection of young black males, but it's benefiting them in certain cases."" If you're looking for things that really went wrong in the Zimmerman case and are part of wider patterns unfavorable toward minorities, try looking at the prosecution's misdeeds. In particular, Florida State Attorney Angela Corey overcharged, going for second-degree murder when even manslaughter was shaky. That didn't cow Zimmerman, who had a sizable legal defense fund, but such tactics work every day in extracting plea-bargain surrenders from ordinary-Joe defendants who fear a worse verdict. Corey's team also tried the case in the news media, made jury-inflaming assertions it couldn't back up with proof, and (according to a whistle-blowing employee, soon fired by Corey) even withheld evidence from the defense side, an ethical breach should it be proven. A public stirred up to outrage over sins like those might come to realize that they're not a fluke of the Zimmerman case, but crop up regularly in the everyday criminal justice system, to the disfavor of minority (and nonminority) defendants. When the emotional grip of the moment has relaxed, we may wonder how we ever imagined that the way to help minorities in the justice system was to take away criminal defendants' rights. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Walter Olson.","Walter Olson: Those upset with verdict call for giving new powers to prosecutors .

"(CNN) -- It's football training, but not as we know it. German champions Borussia Dortmund are boldly going where no club has gone before with the ""Footbonaut"", a soccer training machine powered by a smart phone. Winners of the Bundesliga title in each of the last two seasons, Dortmund has unveiled the 14-meter cage which is the brainchild of Berlin-based designer Christian Guttler. Once inside the ""Footbonaut"", a player is fed balls by eight different machines, having to find one of the 72 panels - - lit by a flashing green light -- which make up the space-age contraption before receiving another ball. Dortmund hope the device, which can also be operated using a tablet, will improve a player's technique, spatial awareness and peripheral vision. Intensity . Not that Dortmund requires much improvement. Jurgen Klopp's team sits fourth in the German top flight and is being heavily tipped for European success after excelling in a Champions League group containing Real Madrid, Manchester City and Ajax, with the Spanish club's manager Jose Mourinho viewing them as candidates to win the tournament. Klopp has instilled in Dortmund a non-stop adventurous style of football and the ""Footbonaut"" is the next step in their pursuit of excellence. ""It´s as if you are surrounded by 10 colleagues who are there only to serve you balls,"" said Dortmund's Australian youngster Mustafa Amini after a session inside the cage. ""In the course of normal training that level of intensity just is not possible. The ´Footbonaut´ allows you to work on any weaknesses and ensures that you play at pace but with precision."" Guttler claims that after 15 minutes in the cage a player ""will have received and passed on as many balls as he would in a normal week of training. ""Repetition and intensity are crucial if you want to conquer a particular skill, whether that be playing football, tennis or learning the piano."" Perfect tool . Dortmund's success in recent years and the performances of players like striker Robert Lewandowski and midfielder Mario Gotze have attracted admiring glances from a host of top clubs. Japan's Shinji Kagawa and Nurin Sahin of Turkey have both been developed by Dortmund in recent years before being sold on to Manchester United and Real Madrid respectively. Sahin is currently on loan at Liverpool. And former Mainz coach Klopp hopes the ""Footbonaut"" can help Dortmund maintain their stellar standards. ""It is the perfect tool to improve ball-handling skills,"" said the 45-year-old. ""It demands precise skills used at speed in a physically tough environment. It´s quite a package!"" Echoing Klopp's excitement, Dortmund's chief scout Sven Mislintat is interested by the cage's potential to analyze player development. ""We can closely monitor a player´s development with data gleaned from the machine,"" said Mislintat. ""There is no reason why a player cannot translate the actions practised in this environment onto the actual playing field."" Caution . But Belgian coach Michel Bruyninckx, who works with the Aspire Academy in Qatar -- the gulf kingdom which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup -- struck a note of caution. ""One of the major features of high performance is focused attention and that can be trained through this device,"" Bruyninckx told CNN. ""Brain research tells us that optimal learning requires that skill training must be embedded in the natural environment of an activity. This is not the case (with 'Footbonaut'). ""The fact the player must react to a sound is not matching the reality of a game when a player reacts to visual information."" And Bruyninckx questioned the position of the player in the cage. ""The fact the performing player always stays in the central position is also a disadvantage. In a game he has to move and search for the best position to receive the ball. ""I am also curious to know how one-footed or technically less skilled players are going to react tn the 'Footbonaut'. For me you need to prepare a player for this kind of resource."" Bruyninckx also raised concerns over the grueling physical workout which the cage gives a player. ""Using sweating as a parameter is not a good approach,"" he said. ""Too often coaches think that high intensity delivers high performance. Brain research tells us that if energy is low, learning will go down."" So, while the ""Footbonaut"" is one small step for Dortmund, it could take a giant leap for the device to become a fixture at training grounds across the world.","German champions Borussia Dortmund pioneer the use of ""space age"" training .

"(CNN) -- Hating the Internal Revenue Service is an American pastime that transcends political affiliation. This past May, disgust for the IRS reached an all-time high when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations unit, disclosed the agency had improperly targeted social welfare organizations seeking special status under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code based on their political ideology. This revelation resulted in more than three months (and counting) of congressional hearings and investigations. Read the IRS inspector general's report on targeting . But in typical Washington fashion, the manufactured congressional outrage and grandstanding has served to do little more than obfuscate the real scandal at the IRS: that the agency allows social welfare organizations to manipulate federal tax law by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on political ads. Anyone who watched television in the lead-up to the 2010 and 2012 elections undoubtedly noticed the slew of vitriolic, misleading campaign ads. Some of these ads were sponsored by federal candidates, but many more were produced by groups with innocuous sounding names -- such as Crossroads GPS or the American Action Network -- but massive bank accounts. Crossroads GPS, for example, a nonprofit organization cofounded by former George W. Bush administration official Karl Rove, spent more than $70 million on the 2012 election. Like the groups targeted by the IRS, Crossroads GPS is a section 501(c)(4) organization, which affords certain tax benefits and -- most importantly -- the ability to keep the names of donors secret. Federal law requires these groups to operate ""exclusively for purposes beneficial to the community as a whole."" IRS regulations, however, create a loophole in the law by allowing groups ""primarily"" engaged in these types of activities to benefit from this tax status. Many 501(c)(4) groups have interpreted this regulation to mean they can spend up to 49% of their funds on political activities -- mostly negative, deceptive political ads. Adding to the confusion, the IRS has said there is no specific percentage the agency uses to gauge whether a group has engaged ""primarily"" in social welfare activities, but rather that it considers all facts and circumstances. What does that mean exactly? No one knows. When directly confronted about the problem and the agency's record of inaction, the IRS has said only that it is ""aware"" of the issue. But the IRS has been aware of and has chosen to ignore this problem for more than 50 years. If the agency had revised its regulations at any point in the past as my organization and others requested, the agency might have avoided the quagmire in which it is drowning. Frustrated with the IRS's inaction, in May CREW filed a lawsuit against the IRS for flouting the law barring 501(c)(4) organizations from engaging in political activity. The case is pending in District of Columbia district court. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and other public interest groups filed a similar lawsuit last month. Because social welfare organizations are not required to disclose their donors, 501(c)(4) groups have become the de facto vehicle for millionaires, billionaires, and even corporations who want to remain anonymous while influencing our elections. As a result, politically active nonprofit groups spent more than $300 million on the 2012 election. Americans should not only be outraged that our elections are being flooded with anonymous cash, but because of the nonprofit status of these groups, taxpayers are subsidizing their activity. With more and more groups seeking to participate in federal elections using money raised from donors who want to remain anonymous, applications to the IRS for 501(c)(4) status more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. To manage the deluge, Lerner said the agency relied on code words and other shortcuts to single groups out for extra review. While the scrutiny of tea party groups has received the most attention, the IRS ""Be on the Look Out"" (BOLO) list also included the words ""progressive,"" ""occupy,"" and ""Israel."" Flagging any group for further screening because their applications included specific words or phrases was wrong. The impact, however, of such misguided actions on our democracy was negligible, particularly compared to that wrought by the IRS's failure to stop hundreds of millions of dollars from flooding our electoral system to influence our votes. For all of the abuse heaped upon the IRS and for all the concern about the BOLO list, the same thing could happen again if the disparity between the language of the statute and regulation is not addressed. Agents processing applications of groups seeking social welfare status in the future will remain as confused about the standards as those whose decisions have been questioned this year. Nevertheless, Congress has shown no appetite to pass legislation clarifying the requirements for these nonprofit groups. As the 2014 election cycle gets under way, the super rich and corporations with deep coffers will continue to buy our elections, and Congress will continue to spend time and resources on a never-ending cycle of investigations into a problem with a fairly easy solution: as Congress intended when it first passed the law, prohibit 501(c)(4) organizations from spending money on anything other than social welfare activities. As long as members of Congress do nothing other than one-up each other's disdain for the IRS, nothing will change. And that really is a scandal. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- You thought maybe le foot (soccer) was the national sport of France? Wrong. It's la politique. And this year there's a doubleheader! For the first time since 1988, the U.S. and France are holding presidential elections in the same year. Generally speaking, the French feel a strong political kinship with the U.S. because the countries fanned each other's revolutionary flames, and the two nations were forged (reforged, in their case) at the furnace of the Enlightenment. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, France, like the rest of the world, was watching with hope and wonder as Bush rode off into the sunset and the U.S. elected its first African-American president. This time around, though, average French people aren't paying much attention to what's going on in the U.S. Their bandwidth is maxed out with their own high-stakes election, the multiple crises in Europe, and the ongoing aftershocks of the Arab Spring. Postcard: Cairo casts cynical eye on U.S. election . Those among the French who are paying attention to the election, mostly les intellos (intellectuals), are enjoying the spectacle, finding it simultaneously entertaining and horrifying. On one team, there's America's suave, crooning president, and on the other, the GOP candidates, whose retrograde rhetoric simply baffles the French. Obama's coolitude* . From left to right, the French appreciate Obama the president for his efforts to institute universal healthcare, but they're quite disappointed that he still hasn't closed Guantanamo. But Obama the candidate has charmed them utterly. Presidents and presidential candidates here in France are, for the most part, reserved and dignified (read: dull), often graduates of ENA (the École nationale d'administration, a Harvard-level statesman-producing factory). Obama is so dignified he could be French. But he's also just plain cool. The French—the people and the media—get a kick out of his coolitude: his laid-back demeanor, his humor, his hipness (publishing his campaign playlist on Spotify), his ninja fly-swatting skills and moments like his impromptu duo with B.B. King. In France's 2007 presidential election, after 12 years of the dignified yet amiable yet ineffectual Jacques Chirac, the French felt a need to shake things up a bit (and maybe let some fresh air into their stuffy politics). So they elected the guy who seemed to be the antithesis of the traditional candidate: former business lawyer Nicolas Sarkozy, a hot dog whose bulldozer leadership style, pro-business policies and decidedly un-French tastes earned him the nickname ""Sarko the American."" But he's not cool (though he thinks he is). Cool is not a characteristic that comes naturally to French government types. Just look at the campaign posters of the two leading presidential candidates this year (François Hollande and Sarkozy). See? No cool. Different campaign approaches . When it comes to campaigning, the French are shocked by the massive amounts of money Americans pour into campaigns and the attack ads that the money funds. Interactions between politicians remain pretty civil here in France, as you might have guessed (dignity, again). Furthermore, French law strictly limits the amount of money that can be spent on campaigns (which might explain the ugly posters), as well as the amount of media coverage each candidate is allowed. Since anyone who can collect 500 signatures from elected officials in France (of which there are tens of thousands) can run for president, these laws guarantee a level playing field for porn stars and other ""regular"" people or small-party candidates who'd like to occupy the Elysée (presidential palace). Then there's the cult of personality in U.S. politics that doesn't exist in France (although that's changing). The French have the impression that U.S. campaigns are more about the candidates than their ideas, and that when candidates do present ideas, they don't seem particularly substantial. I discussed this the other day with one of the regulars in a café down the street who said, ""There's no such thing as politics in America anymore. It's all PR."" Party animals . Unlike the U.S., with only two functioning parties (maybe that's going a little far) that you can sometimes barely tell apart and no real left to speak of, France has many active political parties, from extreme left (and the Parti Communiste Français is not considered extreme left) to extreme right. One Frenchwoman I spoke to this week sniffed, ""Obama isn't even a social democrat!"" (that's about center in France). Having so many parties works (kind of) in France because there is universal suffrage here and because French presidents are elected in two rounds. This system isn't foolproof, though. The French are still smarting from their 2002 election in which the votes of the left were so spread around in the first round that the extreme right candidate (Le Pen) slipped past the favorite left candidate (Jospin) into the second round. Two recipes for an extreme right . The French also have a hard time grasping the degree of religious extremism in the American right because the God thing is much more of a fringe phenomenon here. The French, haunted by the memory of centuries under the thumb of the Catholic church, cut the cord between church and state definitively over 100 years ago. Some French people have compared America's Tea Party to France's extreme right party, the Front National, but fundamentalist Catholics do not represent a majority of that party's constituents, and religion is not the binding agent in France's right-wing sauce. Healthcare for all . The U.S. election issue that gets the biggest rise out of the French is universal healthcare. Nearly everyone I spoke to while writing this article brought it up. It's something that, according to one Frenchman, his compatriots haven't called into question in ""over a hundred years."" The French deplore the fact that the U.S. is the only Western democracy without universal healthcare (and the only one with the death penalty, for that matter). In the context of our presidential campaign, the French are dumbfounded and deeply dismayed by the brutality of the Republican rhetoric around this issue and some voters' opposition to Obama's healthcare plan. Learning from the past. Or not. While working on this article, I had a chance to chat with Razak, a political blogger and photography buff. He brought to my attention the fact that shortly before Newt Gingrich dropped his ""make the poor kids work as janitors"" bomb, there had been a major retrospective in Paris of the photographs of Lewis Hine. The photos Hine took for the National Child Labor Committee documenting children at work played a major role in bringing about changes to child labor laws in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Nearly 32,000 Parisians went to the exhibit. * The suffix -itude (-ness) is a real suffix, but it's been tacked on to all kinds of words ever since Ségolène Royal inadvertently coined the word bravitude (to mean bravery) during her 2007 French presidential campaign. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pamela Poole.","For the first time since 1988, the U.S. and France are holding presidential elections in the same year .

"(CNN) -- Prepare yourself for the Age of Ultron. Joss Whedon surprised the crowd at the end of the Marvel panel at Comic-Con to reveal this as the title and main character of Avengers 2. We'll get to that. We promise. But first the Marvel crew ran down all the major titles coming up, including new details on ""Thor: The Dark World,"" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" See complete Comic-Con coverage . Here's how it happened: . The Comic-Con panel begins: . Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige is introduced as ""the master of nerd puppetry"" by moderator Chris Hardwick. Asked what he has in the works, Feige says: ""Well, we have a movie called Thor: The Dark World."" A cavernous boom! And then total darkness as the billboard-sized screen in 6,000-seat Hall H goes blank. ""Humanity ... look how far you've fallen. Lining up in the heat ... chattering together in the dark ... LIKE BEASTS!!!"" Aaand LIGHTNING FLASH as Tom Hiddleston appears in character as Loki. Thor: The Dark World . ""Stand back, you mewling quim!"" He declares. And everyone falls down in fealty, cheering. ""You should have let me rule you when you had the chance."" Hiddleston, er, Loki unleashes an Asgardian-style Don Rickles routine, insulting the miserable mass of humanity before him. Then asks: ""Say my name?"" LOKI!!! the crowd roars . ""Say my NAME!"" he says, no longer asking. The crowd chants: LOKI ...! LOKI ...! LOKI ....! Hiddleston smiles: ""Then I have an army."" A clip of ""Thor: The Dark World"" begins to play, showing Chris Hemsworth's hammer-swinging hero in an epic, galactic battle. At one point, Natalie Portman's character appears to slap Loki. ""That was for New York,"" she says. Again, Loki smiles. The clip ends and bow power has been restored. Feige begins introducing the cast of ... See stars' Comic-Con self-portraits . Captain America: The Winter Soldier . Nearly the full cast of The Winter Soldier gathers (minus Robert Redford and a few other key parts), and Evans is asked if Cap is finally adjusting to modern life. ""It's not like he's shocked by, 'oh wow, the Internet!'"" Evans says. ""But today it's harder to know who is right and who's wrong."" Is Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow a cameo or a major role? Feige says ""She and Chris share this movie in a big way."" We get to see how she is in a more casual working relationship,"" Johansson says. ""It starts to break down the barriers of the walls she has put up. This film is gritty and has some down and dirty bare-knuckle fighting."" Evans says Captain America and Black Widow have an ""odd couple"" relationship, coming from very different attitudes about what is right and wrong. There's still a week left before shooting is complete, but Marvel is presenting a clip. Here's the recap: . Unknown thugs gather in an elevator and Steve Rogers can tell something is wrong. One of them is Frank Grillo as the villain Crossbones. ""Before we start,"" Cap says. ""Anyone want to get out?"" A face-crushing fistfight breaks out, and all fall except Crossbones. ""I just want you to know, Cap. None of this is personal,"" he says. ""It kinda feels personal,"" Rogers says, and the battle continues. ""To build a better world sometimes means tearing the wold one down,"" says Robert Redford's voice. He appears against a large window, Alexander Pierce, ""Disorder, war, all it takes is one step."" Now Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury speaka: ""We're going to neutralize a lot of threats before they happen."" ""I thought the punishment usually came after the crime,"" Cap says. ""S.H.I.E.L.D. sees the world as it is, not as we hope it to be,"" Fury replies. The last shot is Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, picking up Captain America's fallen shield. Guardians of the Galaxy . Next, Feige reveals that the upcoming space saga Guardians of the Galaxy has just started shooting in the U.K. and wanted to come to Comic-Con. ""So they decided to come ...!"" Here's a rundown of who is who in the cast: . Yondu -- Michael Rooker, playing a galactic big-game hunter and founding member of the Guardians. Nebula -- Karen Gillian — The chrome-domed mercenary and supervillain. ""I might have done something a little bit crazy,"" she says and pulls off a wig to reveal her shaved head. Ronan the Accuser — Lee Pace, as a leader of the evil alien race known as the Kree. Korath the Pursuer -- Djimon Hounsou, an affiliate of the Kree who is allied with Ronan. The Collector — Benicio del Toro, playing an ancient being who gathers lifeforms from around the galaxy to keep as his own. Drax the Destroyer-- Dave Batista, ""When I go the job, I broke down and cried like a little baby,"" the physically massive pro wrestler said. ""I'm 44 years old, I'm the baby on the set in terms of acting experience. I go to work every day and try to learn something new."" Gamora — Zoe Saldana, as the emerald-hued alien assassin who is the adopted daughter of one of the most evil beings in the universe: Thanos. ""I've done blue, I figured why not try green?"" Star-Lord — Chris Pratt, on his new ripped physique: ""I had a tapeworm."" His character is a half-human, half-alien who never fit in on Earth, and hasn't really found a place for himself anywhere else in the galaxy either. Even though the film has only been shooting a short time, Marvel completed some special effects for a short teaser reel. It begins with ... A large crypt-like door opening — vaguely futuristic and vaguely ancient. It's Chris Pratt as Star-Lord walking into what appears to be temple, claiming an artifact in a sort-of recreation of Raiders of the Lost Ark. But Djimon Hounsou's Korath stops him. ""NO problem. NO problem at all,"" Star-Lord says, hardly brave. He identifies himself as Star-Lord, which makes Korath go: ""Who?"" ""Star-Lord, man! Legendary outlaw? Forget it."" Then, although we don't see any of Benicio Del Toro's The Collector (he hasn't shot any scenes yet) we ironically get a scene reminiscent of the line-up from The Usual Suspects. Each of the Guardians is standing behind a one-way mirror in a futuristic mug-shot situation as John C. Reilly's galactic lawman Rhomann Dey gives the rundown: . Drax the Destroyer flexes and scowls, a big green mean looking gent, ripped with red markings. Gamora — He ID's the assassin as death-craving villain Thanos' adopted daughter. We see a short, fuzzy, bandit-looking creature (who doesn't speak — sorry, still no casting there.) ""He calls himself Rocket,"" Reilly says. ""Wanted on over fifty charges of vehicular theft"" Groot, the tree warrior is shown — although he is so large his face is above the frame and we only see his trunk. ""He's been traveling recently as a personal houseplant-slash-muscle,"" Reilly says. ""Peter Jason Quill, also known as Star-Lord. He's wanted largely on charges of minor assault."" Lame. ""They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy,"" Reilly says. Beat. ""What a bunch of a-holes."" Cue the music as ""Ooga chocka ooga ooga ooga chocka"" begins to play,"" and Blue Swede's ""Hooked on a Feeling"" (Peter Quill's jam) plays through some quick flashes of spaceships and galactic carnage. Finally, the big finish ... The Avengers: Age of Ultron . Joss Whedon arrives to reveal that Avengers 2 will be called ... Age of Ultron! Crowd. Melts. Down. For those who don't follow the comic book world as closely, a little background is in order. Ultron was a sentient robot who was the creation of a scientist named Dr. Henry Pym — also known as Ant-Man, which means Avengers 2 will likely introduce the hero of Edgar Wright's upcoming Marvel movie. Ultron is self-aware and develops a craving for power, according to comics lore. He begins rebuilding himself into more and more powerful iterations and seeks to create artificial life himself in a twisted desire to become a parent — especially important since he eventually wars with his own ""father,"" Hank Pym. But ... the curious thing about the footage Whedon presented to introduce the Age of Ultron title is that it begins with a close-up of what appears to be Iron Man's mask. We hear various lines various Avengers that were spoken in previous Marvel movies. As they speak, the Iron Man helmet spins and is scratched, dented, and pulverized. It is transforming, and at the end we see a pullback and the title reveal: Iron Man's mask has become Ultron's grinning, fang-like metallic skull. So will Hank Pym actually NOT be part of Ultron's story? Might we see Marvel retcon this bit of lore to make Tony Stark the creator of Ultron. (Hey, he has the almost-sentient artificial intelligence Jarvis to help him. He's close!) Whedon offered no clues. But Age of Ultron was also the name of an apocalyptic series of comics by Brian Michael Bendis that was published this year, featuring the robot villain taking over the entire planet and leaving it in ruins, while superheroes turn refugee and hide away while plotting a counter-attack. (There's a lot more to it than that, and casual fans may want to seek out the book ASAP before spoilers proliferate in Avengers 2 news reports.) One thing is certain — the movie can't be totally faithful to the books, which prominently feature Wolverine and Spider-Man, among other heroes that are licensed to other studios. But we'll find out more as we near the release date: May 1, 2015. Thor: The Dark World opens Nov. 8. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is due in theaters April 4, 2014.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy didn't back off the controversial edict he issued or Egypt's upcoming constitutional referendum, saying Thursday night that he respects peaceful opposition to his decisions but won't stand for violence. Addressing ""those who oppose me"" and his supporters, Morsy condemned those involved in recent clashes -- referring specifically to those armed with weapons and who are backed and funded by members of the ""corrupt ... ex-regime"" -- and promised they'd be held accountable. ""(They) will not escape punishment,"" the president said in a televised speech. Morsy's words not only failed to mollify many protesters on the streets, it further enraged them. Activists camped in Cairo's Tahrir Square chanted ""Leave! Leave! Leave!"" as the president talked. And minutes after the speech ended, the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Cairo was ""ablaze,"" state TV reported, citing witnesses. The Islamist group said on its website and Twitter that the building came under ""a terrorist attack,"" with hundreds were surrounding it. Yet by 1 a.m. Friday, there was no sign of a fire or significant damage to the building. Supporters from both sides were at the site, as were security forces between them and the headquarters. Jihad Haddad, a senior adviser in the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood that Morsy once led, wrote on Twitter that 36 Brotherhood and party offices were ""destroyed"" by opponents in the last two weeks. Banned under longtime President Hosni Mubarak, the Brotherhood is now Egypt's dominant political force. On Twitter, the Islamist group has said it would hold opposition figures ""fully responsible for escalation of violence & inciting their supporters."" Adel Saeed, a spokesman for Egypt's newly appointed general prosecutor, said Friday morning that Hamdeen Sabahi, Mohamed ElBaradei and Amr Moussa are being investigated for allegedly ""conspiring to topple"" the government. All three are well-known internationally -- with ElBaradei being a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Moussa a one-time head of the Arab League -- and are now being probed for their role in the opposition against Morsy, who defeated all three in this year's presidential election. Those taking part in the protests around the North African nation say the scenes are similar to those of the 2011 uprising that led to Mubarak's ouster. This time, they say, dissent is being vigorously stamped out by Morsy's backers in government and on the street. Specifically, they spoke of thugs with knives and rocks chasing activists, presidential backers belittling opponents and pressure from various quarters to go home and be quiet. ""It's exactly the same battle,"" said Hasan Amin, a CNN iReporter. A November 22 edict by Morsy, in which he made his decisions immune to judicial oversight until a new constitution is voted upon, set off the latest wave of political unrest. And it's been growing -- and growing more violent -- in recent days. Ahead of the president's speech, opposition leaders were specific in what would mollify them: Morsy must roll back his edict granting himself expanded presidential powers and postpone the scheduled December 15 referendum on a proposed constitution, which they say doesn't adequately represent or protect all Egyptians. Neither happened. iReport: Bloody clashes around Egyptian Presidential palace . That fact, itself, isn't surprising. Morsy previously defended the edict as necessary to defend the revolution and his administration has insisted the proposed constitution was drafted legally and the referendum will go on as planned. If people vote it down, the president said Thursday night that he'd form a new assembly to draft another constitution. Yet opposition activists haven't shown any indication that they trust Morsy on that or other counts. They accuse him of consolidating power for himself and the Muslim Brotherhood, in part by having an Islamist-dominated group push through the draft constitution. ""This is not what we asked for,"" one protester said. ""It's a complete dictatorship."" The National Salvation Front, an umbrella group of opposition groups, including ElBaradei's Constitution Party, promised their fight is not over, calling for more mass protests Friday and claiming authorities ""lost legitimacy,"" said the group, according to the semi-official al-Ahram newspaper. These demonstrations would follow heated protests Thursday, including about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Cairo where a crowd tried to storm Morsy's home, according to the Interior Ministry. Police fired tear gas to disperse the group, and at least 20 protesters and six police officers were injured. Police arrested eight suspects carrying swords and clubs, the ministry said. Morsy was not at the home at the time. Read more: Q&A: What's driving Egypt's unrest? In the Maadi neighborhood of Cairo, someone also damaged the offices of the Freedom and Justice Part, the ministry said. The scene was calm, but tense, outside the presidential palace in the capital, where the military parked tanks and armored personnel carriers, put up barbed-wire barricades and deployed soldiers. In what looked like a war zone, piles of rubble and burned cars littered the streets and doors of nearby storefronts were smashed in. Morsy also suffered a hit closer to home Thursday when Rafik Habib, the deputy head of the Freedom and Justice Party, resigned, party spokesman Ahmed Sobe said. Habib did not give a reason. His resignation brings to five the number of presidential advisers who have left in the last two days. It is the first, however, from the Freedom and Justice Party. Read more: Egyptian media strikes against President Morsy . Egyptian judges and media organizations also have staged strikes to show their displeasure with the situation. And 11 organizations representing lawyers, journalists, writers, actors, musicians and tour guides said Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood were behind the violence, al-Ahram reported. The group said it would call for Morsy's ouster if the administration failed to protect protesters and ""fulfill the aspirations of the January 25 revolution,"" the newspaper said. Vice President Mahmoud Mekki asked critics Wednesday to submit their proposals for improving the constitution, and Morsy invited political opponents to a meeting Saturday at the president palace. But Morsy hasn't said he's ready to alter the constitution or the planned referendum date. And some Muslim Brotherhood officials have been more steadfast, as well as derogatory toward the opposition. Muslim Brotherhood Secretary-General Mahmoud Hussein said Thusday protesters weren't interested in democracy. He accused them of using ""crude and contemptible ways of expression, rather than (putting) their points across in a civilized manner."" While insisting he respects Egyptians' right to peaceful protest, Morsy spent a significant portion of his Thursday night speech blasting those he claims are behind the recent violence. He accused unspecified foreign and domestic sources of funding and fomenting the unrest, making specific reference to ""corrupt"" opposing forces tied to Mubarak's government. ""The deposed Mubarak regime will not be brought back to life under any circumstances,"" Morsy said, tweeted the Muslim Brotherhood. Are you there? Share your story but stay safe. Read a version of this story in Arabic. Reza Sayah and Ian Lee reported from Cairo; Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Washington (CNN) -- Some very preliminary talks have been under way ""for the past few days"" to potentially allow Boston bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to resume providing investigators with information about the attacks in exchange for having the death penalty taken off the table, two government sources say. The sources said such initial communications between opposing sides on a range of procedural and other issues are standard procedure. Communications are in the very early stages, and not a sign lawyers for either side are ready to make a deal, said one source, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the private discussions. The source emphasized these are not formal negotiations, and no deals have been offered. The discussions between prosecution and defense attorneys are at a ""preliminary, delicate stage"" and both refused to offer details of what either side would be willing to leverage, according to the sources. A Justice Department official said it is not accurate to suggest there are negotiations. ""The notion that we are engaging in discussions over a penalty is not accurate,"" the official said. ""As far as I know, there are no negotiations."" The government has not said whether it will seek the death penalty in this case. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd noted Tuesday that ""the federal charges against Tsarnaev authorize a penalty, upon conviction, of death or imprisonment for life, or any term of years."" The charges include using a weapon of mass destruction. From fear to cheers: The final hours that paralyzed Boston . ""We have no comment at this time on what potential penalty the government might seek if the defendant is convicted, particularly given that the defendant has only just been charged,"" Boyd added. This comes after a federal magistrate judge Monday approved appointment of a defense attorney who specializes in handling capital cases. Judy Clarke of San Diego has a reputation of working with high-profile clients to get death-eligible crimes reduced. She has represented Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Atlanta Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph, and most recently Tucson mass shooter Jared Lee Loughner. Clarke separately cut deals for all three to avoid lethal injection. The suspect is hospitalized with gunshot wounds at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical center in Devens, Massachusetts. He and his brother, Tamerlan, are suspected of detonating two explosive devices at the Boston Marathon race April 15, leaving three dead and more than 175 people wounded. The elder Tsarnaev was killed three days later in a gun battle with police. Legal sources say it is not unusual for both sides to reach out and begin these kinds of conversations in high-profile criminal cases. Those sources say both Tsarnaev's legal team and top-level Justice Department officials also have been meeting separately to weigh their options. Two federal public defenders in Boston -- William Fick and Miriam Conrad -- were in the hospital room April 22 when Tsarnaev had his first court appearance, and had his Miranda rights first read to him by federal Magistrate Marianne Bowler. Those lawyers had asked for Clarke to join the legal team, and they must decide whether their client will cooperate with the ongoing investigation. Tsarnaev's lawyers must weigh the initial evidence the government has presented against their client, and the strength of any additional charges that may be added when a formal indictment is presented in coming weeks. That evidence and Tsarnaev's own private statements about his alleged involvement will shape whether plea negotiations develop over time. On the other side, government sources say investigators are eager to resume questioning of Tsarnaev, for any details about other possible suspects and plots. What may have motivated the brothers to allegedly commit the terror acts is also of major interest to the U.S. intelligence community. Removing execution as a legal option could induce the suspect to talk, but nothing is expected until a grand jury hands down an indictment. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder would have the final say on whether prosecutors would pursue the death penalty at trial. That decision, too, is some weeks off, said another government source. A special team of federal agents were able to speak with the seriously wounded Tsarnaev for about two days without any Miranda warnings being given, under a ""public safety exception."" CNN has learned the young man admitted to the acts, and said he and his brother acted alone. Sources say he has since stopped talking with the government. CNN's Joe Johns and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Boston bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is no longer talking with investigators .

"(CNN) -- High flier Karen Zuckerman has a secret weapon for avoiding the air terminal blues: treating herself to a facial or massage while waiting to board her plane. No, Zuckerman doesn't travel with a beauty entourage. She's just one of many travelers taking advantage of the proliferation of airport spas around the world. President of Maryland-based marketing and advertising agency HZDG, Zuckerman often visits high-end beauty temples like the Mandarin Oriental, Four Seasons and Canyon Ranch. While none of these luxurious spas have opened airport outposts (yet), plenty of other brands are helping make flying a whole lot more Zen these days. Executive Travel: America's best spring drives . ""An airport spa gives me the ability to multitask and do a little something for myself,"" explains Zuckerman, who travels about 30 times per year for work within the U.S. and Europe. Depending on what's available, she'll book a facial, massage or quick mani-pedi at whatever terminal she finds herself in. ""When I'm really stressed and can sneak in a 20-minute neck or back massage, that's a huge bonus,"" she says. Can the 'game-changer' still live up to its name? Sunny Kortz of OraOxygen -- whose spas in the Calgary International and Detroit airports attract travelers, airport employees and the odd civilian (the Calgary branch is located pre-security) -- reports that many clients come for combined oxygen/massage treatments.

"(CNN) -- A Texas man killed four women -- including his girlfriend and a woman he was dating -- and wounded three teens and a boy in shootings at two Dallas-area homes, police said Thursday. The man was arrested at the second home after a child there called 911, according to police. When the shootings were done Wednesday night, there were two slain women and two wounded minors at each location -- one in Dallas and the other in DeSoto, roughly 15 miles to the south. Authorities identified those killed as Zina Bowser, 47, Neima Williams, 28, Toya Smith, 43, and Tasmia Allen, 17. They said the suspect in the shootings is 44-year-old Erbie Bowser, who was dating Smith. Zina Bowser was Bowser's estranged wife, they said. When asked about a possible motive, DeSoto police spokesman Nick Bristow said that authorities believe ""it just to be an isolated domestic issue."" The Dallas Mavericks said Bowser used to be a member of the NBA team's Mavs ManiAACs, an all-male hip-hop dance troupe that entertains fans at games. He left the squad in 2009, Mavericks spokesman Scott Tomlin said. Bowser was a special education teacher for Mesquite Independent School District east of Dallas from December 2001 through March 2010, last teaching at Berry Middle School, district spokeswoman Laura Jobe said. He resigned and ""left us on good terms,"" she said. CNN's attempts to contacts Bowser's relatives weren't immediately successful. Relative had bad feeling after call . Authorities learned of the Dallas shootings at 10:30 p.m., when relatives found the carnage there and called 911, police said. Beforehand, one of the victims had talked to her mother on the phone. Something about the conversation concerned the mother, so after calling back and getting no response, she drove with some family members to the Dallas home, where they saw the four who had been shot, Dallas police Maj. Jeff Cotner said. Toya Smith and her 17-year-old daughter were dead inside the house. Injured were the woman's 14-year-old son and a 17-year-old girl who was a family friend, Cotner said. The 14-year-old was in critical condition Thursday. Dallas police had reason to suspect the gunman might have a DeSoto connection, and called DeSoto police, Cotner said. Minutes later -- at 10:45 p.m., while police were traveling to check the DeSoto home -- a child called 911 to report the shooting there, DeSoto police spokeswoman Melissa Franks said. The gunman had used ""some sort of explosive device,"" and then shot at the people inside, Franks said. Zina Bowser and Neima Williams were killed there, and two boys -- ages 11 and 13 -- were injured, she said. Both were in critical condition Thursday. Police arrested the suspect there without incident, she said. Dallas and DeSoto investigators are working together on the case. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is investigating the nature of the explosive device, Franks said. No explanation for Florida shooting rampage that leaves 7 dead .

"(CNN) -- Hamburgers and hot dogs weren't the only things sizzling this Fourth of July. This time of year, triple-digit temperatures are the norm in the Southwest. And people in Arizona, Nevada and parts of California who celebrated America's 237th birthday weren't let down on Thursday: Highs went well past 100, as they have for the past week and then some. But the Northeast? That part of the U.S.A. has been in a seemingly endless rinse cycle for much of the past two weeks, beset by rainy day after rainy day. Those rain clouds, though, took a holiday on Thursday. The sun came out and so did the heat. The National Weather Service issued heat advisories through Thursday night for parts of four New England states because heat indexes -- how hot it feels, accounting for humidity -- reached or surpassed 100 degrees. Those conditions became an issue on Boston's Esplanade, which is along the Charles River across from Cambridge and the site of the city's hallmark July 4th Boston Pops concert and fireworks show. Before 6 p.m. some 120 people had already sought assistance, treatment or evaluation from medical personnel along the Esplanade, said Boston Emergency Medical Services Chief James Hooley. The first person seeking help at one of the seven medical tents being run by EMTs and paramedics came in around 10 a.m., Hooley said. Four people in for heat-related ailments were sent to a local hospital out of abundance of caution, he added. The Northeast could be sweating for a little while longer. New York City, for instance, is under a heat advisory through Saturday. The combination of high temperatures and high humidity will make it feel like it's 95 degrees, which can be dangerous in urban locales that don't have air conditioning. ""Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun and check up on relatives and neighbors,"" the weather service says. The Northeast will be relatively cool compared with what the Southwest has ahead of it. Highs in Las Vegas are not expected to drop below 108 all week (though that's still cooler than Thursday). Phoenix will see similarly sweltering conditions, though there's a ""slight chance of showers and thunderstorms"" -- a rarity in these parts -- in the middle of next week, according to the National Weather Service. From torrential rains to dangerous droughts . Folks in the Southeast and the Ohio River Valley know a thing or two about showers and thunderstorms. They got soaked by them all Independence Day, and those wet conditions could persist. Flood watches are in effect from northern Ohio south to Alabama and extend east into states like West Virginia, the Carolinas and most of Georgia. They extend through Friday, if not longer, in areas that have already experienced days of soaking. The wet stuff has prompted communities from Grove City, Ohio, to Franklin, Tennessee, to Decatur, Georgia, to postpone their July 4 celebrations, fireworks and all. But some didn't let rain, rain and more rain deter them. Take the thousands who turned out in Atlanta's Peachtree Road Race, the world's largest 10K, and ran  through an intermittent rain. Georgia's capital should get 3 to 4 inches of rain by the time this weekend's over, according to CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri. While much of the Peach State had been mired in drought for years, that's not the case this year thanks to months like the last one, when about 10 inches of rain made it Atlanta's fourth wettest June ever, said Javaheri. Extreme to exceptional drought conditions persist east of the Mississippi River, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which is a partnership of the University of Nebraska's National Drought Mitigation Center, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The worst conditions hold in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona. The latter is the site of the Yarnell Hill Fire about 75 miles northwest of Phoenix, where 19 firefighters died this week trying to curb the blaze. Mother Nature hasn't been cooperating, with temperatures soaring into the high 90s and winds gusting stronger than 20 mph once again Thursday. But there could be good news coming, at least: The thermostat is forecast to peak in the 80s through the weekend. And there's a 10% to 30% chance of showers and thunderstorms over that stretch -- though lightning from those storms could spark yet more fires. CNN's Ed Payne, Tina Burnside, Michael Martinez and CNN meteorologist Chad Myers contributed to this report.","NEW: Heat advisories are in effect for New York City, parts of New England .

"(CNN) -- They'd hoped to trade political potshots for wet snowballs. Instead, the storm billed as ""Snowquester"" is turning out to be nothing more than a big wet blanket for members of the Washington D.C. Snowball Fight Association. The group had planned a big showdown in DuPont Circle, where a few years ago 3,000 people turned out for a humdinger of a fight. But where 5 to 10 inches of wet snow was supposed to fall on DuPont Circle, not even slush was accumulating Wednesday afternoon, said organizer Michael Lipin. ""Quite a letdown,"" he said. While the storm was dumping plenty of snow in other places, Washington was getting just fractions of an inch, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. In fact, the National Weather Service dropped its winter storm warning for the Washington area Wednesday afternoon. ""It's just not panning out to be the storm we'd thought it would be,"" Morris said. In nearby Virginia, however, things were quite different. Gov. Bob McDonnell declared a state of emergency, state police extended shifts and the National Guard called up 100 troops for snow duty as inches of wet, heavy snow fell across parts of the state. Authorities opened shelters for the 215,000 Virginians without power, according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. Transportation officials reported particularly nasty conditions on many secondary and some primary routes in 15 central and northern counties, with deep snow or ice covering the pavement. State and many county offices closed early. About 4,200 utility workers were in the field trying to deal with outages, Rodney Blevins of Dominion Power said during a news conference. How do you really feel about the snow? Airlines canceled more than 1,600 flights, leaving passengers such as Alex Thompson, who had hoped to take a flight to San Francisco, with plenty of time on their hands. Thompson traveled all the way from Kenya only to find that his next flight was one of hundreds called off until Thursday because of the storm. With no hotel reservations and nowhere else to go, he said he'd find a place to sack out at Dulles International Airport and ""waste my time until I can get on my flight."" Capital closings . The dire forecast issued Tuesday prompted the federal government to close offices in the nation's capital, but emergency workers and telecommuters were expected to be on duty, according to the Office of Personnel Management. The White House canceled a planned celebration for the Alabama Crimson Tide, college football champions, and Congress called off several hearings. More than 954,000 students who attend major school districts in Washington, Virginia, Maryland and Ohio got the day off. Amtrak shut down some trains in Washington, Virginia, West Virginia and New York. Track the late-winter storm . But tourism goes on . Not all of Washington was shut down. Although the National Zoo was closed, the Smithsonian said its museums would be open for visitors. Washington's Metrorail system was running, although some bus service was disrupted, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. Flooding threat . Along the coast, the problem wasn't snow, but high winds and the threat of flooding. The National Weather Service issued coastal flood warnings for parts of Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. Officials in parts of New Jersey suggested residents evacuate from flood-prone areas along the coast, including areas still recovering from damage done by Hurricane Sandy in October, according to CNN affiliate WABC. A flood warning was in effect through Friday morning for the eastern coast of Massachusetts based on a ""high confidence"" for high winds, storm surge, and moderate to major coastal flooding, the state's emergency management agency said. About 300 National Guard troops will be used along the Massachusetts coast to help with flooding and possible evacuations, agency spokesman Peter Judge said. Fifty Delaware National Guard troops were called up as emergency management officials urged some coastal residents in that state to evacuate, saying flooding would cut off exit routes. The agency warned of almost certain flooding in areas and said ""conditions during the height of the storm could make the process of leaving flooded areas dangerous or impossible."" High winds forced the brief closure of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in both directions, Maryland authorities said, but not before a tractor trailer overturned on one end, CNN affiliate WJZ reported. Wind was believed to have been a major factor in the accident. Power was out across the Delmarva Peninsula, which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia and Delaware, Delmarva Power reported. In coastal Sussex County, the 911 center reported numerous calls for wires down, vehicle accidents and trees down. Water breached a sand dune in Sussex County, forcing the closure of State Route 1 in the county, according to DEMA. Is the snow helping ease drought? Midwest recovering . The storm is the same one that earlier dumped about a foot of snow in parts of Illinois, Minnesota and North Dakota, paving a white swath across the Upper Midwest. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport had 6 inches of snow Tuesday, beating a 1999 record for the date by 2.2 inches. It was the first snowfall of 6 inches or more in the Windy City since February 2011, the weather service said. Plows removed snow from roads and trucks spread salt and sand, but drivers still slipped off of roadways, leaving snow-covered cars to be retrieved by tow trucks. Tuesday's snow put a drag on air traffic in the Midwest, leading to delays and cancellations, but planes continued to fly in Columbus, Ohio, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, after plows removed the snow from runways.

"(WIRED) -- A radio without any knobs. A bathroom where a clear display wirelessly streams vital statistics on your health. And a user interface that takes brain waves and translates them into commands for a computer. These are some of the products in development by Cambridge Consultants, a product design and development company. It showed off some of its latest inventions at a daylong event last week in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Check out these sweet ideas, many of which are set to hit retail shelves in the next few weeks. Cube Radio . As devices become more complex to use, designers are striving for simplicity in form. The Q2 Cube internet radio tries to innovate in terms of how users can interact with it. It's the first dial-free radio, say Cambridge Consultants and the Armour Group, which co-developed it. The cube-shaped device lets users choose radio stations or change the volume by moving the device itself. To select one of the four pre-set radio stations, turn the Cube onto one of its 'faces.' Tilting it forward turns the volume up, and tilting it backwards turns it down. The device took about nine months to develop from concept to prototype. Though pricing for it has not yet been announced, the Cube is expected to be available in some retail stores in the U.K. in time for Christmas. Implantable Antenna . Patient care is set to go beyond the doctor's office. New low-power wireless technologies make it possible to implant monitoring devices in people's bodies, to help keep an eye on blood pressure, metabolism and other vital statistics. But one of the challenges of these new wireless devices is designing a suitable antenna that can operate within the human body where fat, muscle and skin tissue create challenging conditions for wireless signals. This implantable antenna uses the 402-405MHz Medical Implant Communications Service (MICS) frequency band. Combined with a custom integrated chip or a system on a chip, device makers can use the antenna in pacemakers, neurostimulation devices, and swallowable imaging and diagnostic systems. Connected Patient . There's no dearth of health and fitness equipment, from the basic digital scale to sophisticated heart and blood pressure monitors. But most of these devices work independently with no easy way to share the data or discern patterns in it. Now picture the bathroom of the future, where these devices can talk to each other and wirelessly stream information onto a single screen. It's easy to do it with the Bluetooth Health Device Profile and the IEEE Personal Health Data specification. In the past, communication between medical devices was based on ad-hoc and proprietary standards, which offered limited or no interoperability. The latest Bluetooth and IEEE standards developed specifically for medical use changes that. For a user, it means, a better overall picture of your fitness and medical information. Mind Control . Taking brain waves and translating them directly into computer commands is a hot new area in user interface design. The idea is to help individuals who are completely paralyzed communicate without having to have surgery to implant electrodes in the brain. Earlier brain control interface systems have been expensive, but engineers have been working to improve accuracy and bring costs down. The interface has three primary hardware components and several pieces of specialized software. A mesh cap holds small sensor electrodes firmly against the user's head. An amplifier is connected to the electrodes and is used to boost the minute analog signals, measured in microvolts, that are received from the surface of the scalp. The signals are then converted into a digital signal and analyzed by signal processing software running on a PC. Two monitors are connected to the PC, one for the caregiver interface and one for the user interface. The big challenges here are developing a sensor cap that is comfortable and can be positioned accurately on the head by an untrained person. Positioning deviations from session to session of more than a few millimeters can dramatically affect the accuracy of the system. The entire system is currently expected to cost about $5,000 for a patient, although researchers say they are trying to bring that down. Through-the-Wall Radar . Police officers and special forces covet the ability to ""see"" through walls as they mount rescue or military operations. The Prism 200 is a tiny handheld radar scanner that provides intelligence on the movement and location of people in a room or building. It works through brick and concrete walls and is sensitive enough to pick up breathing. Users of the radar can switch between front, plan and profile views for a complete picture. It can also be remotely monitored. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"Washington (CNN) -- As Congress leaves the Capitol for its five-week August recess, freshman Rep. Eric Swalwell is headed home a little frustrated. ""The biggest problem for me is we're voting on extremes. You don't see compromise bills,"" he said Thursday evening on the east steps of the Capitol after a vote. ""When they're voting to just repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), I want to mend it, not end it. The bills are 'repeal it,' with no other solution."" As if to prove his point, in its last act before the recess, the Republican-controlled House on Friday passed a resolution to prevent the Internal Revenue Service from implementing Obamacare -- the 40th time it has voted to repeal, dismantle or defund the Affordable Care Act. With Democrats in control of the Senate, the measure has no chance of passing there. Obamacare battle heads to states . Swalwell, who represents California's 15th District, which encompasses part of Silicon Valley and is considered one of the country's wealthiest, defeated fellow Democrat Rep. Pete Stark last year. The 32-year-old wasn't yet born when Stark was first elected to Congress in 1973. ""New energy, new ideas is what [my campaign] was about,"" he said. ""Using social media to reach different people."" But seven months in, he finds the pace a bit sluggish. ""It's frustrating,"" he said. ""I was a prosecutor before I came here, so I would get a case, I would review the evidence, put it in front of a jury, get a verdict. Move on. Here John Dingell put a health care bill in the hopper every year for 50 years before we got health care. The place just moves slower than I like."" ""Right now we're throwing one-yard passes and I want to throw a touchdown."" How low can Congress go? Swalwell is also frustrated by some of the archaic practices of the institution and thinks it needs ""a serious technological upgrade."" ""It's an institution that still operates under many 18th century rules,"" he said. ""And I think we can honor the tradition of the institution and still upgrade the institution and use a lot of technologies that private industry uses."" Swalwell is a big proponent of social media and is pushing for Congress to use it more, but his Vining his ""no"" vote on a House bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy broke a House rule on video recording in the chamber. Leaders issued a statement stressing the rule but Swalwell stood by his Vine. Swalwell has formed a bipartisan group of about 30 House freshmen called the United Solutions Caucus, which held a forum on Thursday in which both the liberal Center for American Progress and the conservative Heritage Foundation participated. Then his office threw a barbecue on the balcony. To try and get Congress to get more work done, Swalwell and and Republican Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico proposed electronic voting from districts on non-substantive bills, ""So, when we're actually here, (we can) do real, substantive work rather than these suspension bills where we're just stating the sense of Congress or allowing the Boy Scouts to use the Capitol grounds for the Soap Box Derby."" CNN analysis: Congress in D.C. far less than it used to be . On the eve of his last day in session until September, Swalwell prepared to explain to his constituents his frustrations over Obamacare, which both sides expect to be a contentious topic in town hall meetings across the country this year. ""We've heard from groups on the left and the right, from business and labor about issues on the Affordable Care Act, but that's not what we're voting on. And so it's hard to go back home and say, 'All I've been able to vote on is something that wants to end it,'"" he said. ""That's frustrating. You get these false choices, and there's a lot more in the middle that I think we could work on."" Immigration activists aren't taking a recess . ""I don't think the American public realizes that. They think you vote on all this stuff, every bill introduced you get to vote on. But the truth is you're kind of set up with these false choices and that's frustrating."" But he's also looking forward to his return and working with his freshmen classmates to find some middle ground. ""You just keep trying,"" he said. ""It takes a snowball to create an avalanche. We came here to be problem-solvers; we didn't come here to throw bombs and divide us further. So we just need to keep trying."" ""I'm not naÃ¯ve,"" he continued. ""It's not going to happen overnight, but I do think there is a spirit, especially among many in the freshman class, that we can get rid of these false choices, the extremes, and try and find real compromise. ""I don't want to be a jaded sophomore.""","Freshman Rep. Eric Swalwell unseated long-time congressman last year .

"(CNN) -- Your cooking partner is a robot, your fridge can talk, and your plate is your own personal dietician. Oh, and for a laugh you occasionally have a cook-off with a famous holographic chef. This may sound like a scene from 1960s sci-fi cartoon The Jetsons, but the kitchens in coming decades may not be so far off those envisioned by futurologists. Today, a number of significant developments in culinary tech are happening in the field of robotics. CNN's Blueprint team caught up with a group of design students in Poland who recently programmed an industrial robot -- usually tasked with building cars -- to cook. Read more: Making gourmet meals out of maggots . ""Our project is called 'Let's cook the future' and we try to cook with robots -- we had a robot that initially was made just to be in factories and make cars and we tried to treat it as a human and put it in the kitchen."" Says Barbara Dzaman, one of the students involved in the project. The 'Let's cook the future' robot ""prints"" cookies three-dimensionally, building them up layer by layer in almost any shape you could imagine. Dorota Kabala, an industrial designer working alongside the students says that the project looks towards a future where people can make dishes that are only limited by their imagination. ""The problem we are addressing in this project is the need for personalization of production ... at the moment we can observe that people need more personalization, more customization of products than before and now it's possible."" Marek Cecula, a respected Polish designer, ceramicist and visiting professor at the Royal College of Art, London, says that he was ""amazed"" by the students' robot chef but felt that ""we simply don't know where this is going ... How will we relate to objects made completely by a machine? How will these objects relate to our emotions? Where will the relationship between person and object be when the object is made by a machine?"" The introduction of robots into the home is not new, of course. Many of us already live with electronics that have robotic components, such as self-cleaning ovens, single-touch microwaves that automatically adjust to the food you have put in them, and fridges that scan used-by dates. The trend for robots to perform unskilled restaurant jobs has also led to robotic noodle slicers and mechanical waiters, though so far many are mere gimmicks rather than genuine technological solutions. Thomas Johansson, Design Director at Electrolux, says that he thinks there is a place for robots in the kitchen: ""I think kitchen robots could potentially take over some of the common jobs that are repetitive or difficult to do ... I think you could take away some of the boring chores and spend your time doing something more interesting."" Away from robotics, Electrolux has been exploring the creative fringe of kitchen design with its annual Design Lab competition. The company recently announced the semi-finalists for 2013, which include a 3-D food printer and an appliance that calculates the nutritional values, possible toxins and freshness of your food before you start cooking. Johansson says the range of issues being tackled by students in the competition is fascinating in itself: ""A lot of the students are addressing issues like wellbeing, robotics, bio-mimicry, wearable devices, air purification, and also using smart phones and tablets as remote controls. And then there are the issues about food diagnostics, which are especially interesting in light of the horse meat scandal. People are no longer that concerned about what frying pan they use, but what is in the frying pan. Knowing what it is that you are eating is very important."" With work being done in almost every field of home design, it is likely that the kitchen of the future will look significantly different to how it does today. As the old saying goes, the kitchen will always be the heart of the home -- but increasingly that heart is coming to resemble a pacemaker.","Students at Poland's School of Form have developed a robotic chef .

"(CNN) -- Yemen's parliament on Saturday began debating proposed amendments to the country's constitution despite calls from the United States not to proceed with any planned action. According to Yemen's official news agency, SABA, the parliament agreed in principle to continue discussing the proposed constitutional amendments and then referred the matter to a special committee. The proposed amendments have caused much controversy since they were first proposed by Yemen's ruling party, the General People's Congress (GPC). The measures would increase parliamentary seats for women, reduce presidential terms in office and cancel presidential term limits, which are currently set at two consecutive terms. The United States is concerned about continued instability in the country and wants opposition parties to be on board with the changes so that they will not boycott April's parliamentary elections. A separatist movement in the country's south and a delicate cease-fire in the north are still of concern to U.S. President Barack Obama's administration. After Saturday's parliamentary procedure, Yemen's ruling party criticized the U.S. call for a delay on the vote, calling it interference in internal affairs and its sovereignty, SABA reported, attributing it to an unnamed source in the General People's Congress. The ruling party has been in a dialogue with various political forces, the source told SABA. Opposition party members protested outside the parliament Saturday while discussions were ongoing. Local journalists present in parliament Saturday told CNN that 160 members of parliament agreed to form the subcommittee that will finalize the details of the proposed amendments within 60 days. Many members of the opposition say they feel that long-promised reforms have not been delivered and that not enough time remains for appropriate action to be taken that would guarantee a fair poll. Many in Yemen worry the amendments will decrease the likelihood for reform even more and could allow Saleh to appoint himself president for life. The United States on Friday urgently called on Yemen ""to delay parliamentary action"" and asked all parties involved to return to the negotiating table. ""The United States has seen reports regarding the apparent decision by Yemen's ruling General People's Conference to vote on a package of constitutional reforms at a parliamentary session on Saturday, January 1,"" acting U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement. ""Previously, we consistently welcomed and supported the commitments of both the government and the opposition to address issues related to constitutional reforms and other election reforms through the National Dialogue. We continue to believe that the interests of the Yemeni people will be best served through that process of negotiations."" Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has been in office for 32 years and was last re-elected in 2006. According to Mohammed Albasha, spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington, Saleh started a dialogue on the proposed amendments two years ago, but ""coalition building efforts faced continuous hurdles and obstacles because of divisions amongst the opposition bloc.  But there is still a window of opportunity to reach a reconciliation."" Albasha said Yemen's ruling party has made major concessions to the opposition. ""The president's call for the formation of a coalition government that will grant the opposition broader political representation before and after the upcoming parliamentary elections was flat out rejected,"" he said. While Saleh has formed a panel in recent days to engage in dialogue with the opposition, the political discord has only increased.  According to the Yemen Post, as of last Wednesday, the opposition had boycotted parliamentary sittings for a fifth consecutive day. The parliamentary rift is causing concern among Yemen's allies, who feel additional political tension could further destabilize the country. According to Toner's statement, the United States welcomes ""reports that President Saleh has decided to appoint a new team from the ruling party to re-engage with the opposition in a new effort to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion. For that reason, we urgently call on all parties to delay parliamentary action and to return to the negotiating table to reach an agreement that will be welcomed by the Yemeni people as well as Yemen's friends."" Yemen has been locked in a struggle with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, the Yemen-based offshoot of the al Qaeda terror network.  It grabbed the attention of the West with the attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines trans-Atlantic flight as it landed in Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day in 2009. The anti-terror campaign has also come under increased international scrutiny since authorities in late October uncovered a cargo plane bomb plot targeting Western interests. AQAP claimed responsibility for the scheme, which involved shipping explosives disguised as printer toner cartridges on U.S.-bound cargo planes.","The reforms would increase parliamentary seats for women, cancel presidential term limits .

"(CNN) -- An oil spill that prompted evacuations from one of Thailand's most popular tourist spots threatens the country's tourism and fishing industries, Thailand's deputy prime minister has warned, amid concerns about the long-term effects of the leak. Deputy Prime Minister Plodprasop Suraswadi said his country was ill-equipped to properly contain the leak, and authorities should seek assistance from neighboring countries such as Singapore, if necessary. He made the comments Tuesday during a trip to Mozambique, according to Thai government spokesman Teerat Ratanasevi's Twitter page. PTT Global Chemical, Thailand's largest petrochemical producer, admitted a leak had occurred after the waters at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on the popular tourist island of Koh Samet were blackened with oil on Sunday, prompting evacuations of tourists. The company admitted that an estimated 50,000 liters of crude oil had leaked from an offshore pipeline around the area of Rayong's Map Ta Phut deep sea port Saturday. The company's president, Bowon Vongsinudom, told CNN Tuesday that he did not know how the leak had occurred. ""That needs a lot of investigation,"" he said. ""It should not happen at all... anyhow, it already happened therefore we need a lot of investigation by experts."" He said the clean-up, which also involved the efforts of the Royal Thai Navy and volunteers, was progressing well. ""We can see developments which is much better. We can see now the white water."" But Greenpeace has said the clean-up efforts are just beginning, and the long-term impacts of the oil were yet to be appreciated. Vongsinudom's account was ""not the complete picture,"" said Greenpeace Thailand's program manager Ply Pirom. ""We want to know the real impact of the oil leak, and a comprehensive investigation of the environmental impact is needed."" The clean-up effort had relied heavily on spraying the oil with dispersant, which made it sink below the water -- out of sight, but potentially harming marine life. ""It's now under the sea, which will create a long term impact."" One Thai academic believes the leak could up to twice the size of that admitted by PTT Global Chemical. Somporn Chuai-Aree, a professor of mathematics and computer science at Songklanakarin University, estimated the true size of the leak ""could be from 75,000 liters up to 100,000 liters."" ""We have to try to get a good estimate of the size of the leak, because it will affect the scale and preparation of the work the company needs to do to get the clean-up done,"" he said.","Oil leak threatens tourism and fishing industries, says Thai Deputy PM .

"(CNN) -- A ""sleeping"" Victoria Azarenka woke up in time to beat Ana Ivanovic at the U.S. Open and keep alive her chances of reaching a fourth consecutive hard-court grand slam final. Azarenka dropped the first set against the former world No. 1 and struggled to put the Serbian away but eventually prevailed 4-6 6-3 6-4 in a hard-hitting fourth-round encounter that was pushed back to Tuesday because of rain. It was the second straight match the world No. 2 -- she, too, is a former No. 1 -- needed to stage a comeback following a sluggish start. France's Alize Cornet won their tiebreak in the first set in the third round. Men's No. 1 Novak Djokovic had no such troubles, routing Spaniard Marcel Granollers in about one hour, 20 minutes. Azarenka struck a mere four winners in the first set against Ivanovic, combined with nine unforced errors. Ivanovic certainly wasn't asleep, crushing 17 winners. ""Ana came out firing and played amazing in the first set, and I felt like I was a little out of place,"" Azarenka said in an interview on court. ""I was sleeping but she was ripping winners and serving great so I really had to wake up in the second set and fight for the points. ""In the second set I was more determined, more focused and taking the opportunities."" Her numbers weren't that much better in the second set but Ivanovic cooled thanks in part to Azarenka changing the pace at times with a drop shot. In a seesaw third set -- there were four straight breaks at one stage -- Azarenka blew two match points serving at 5-3 only to be let off the hook when Ivanovic dumped a backhand on a fourth match point. Although Ivanovic put up a brave fight, she ultimately slumped to 3-20 against top-two opposition. ""The match points were pretty bad,"" Azarenka, who lost last year's final to Serena Williams, said. ""I didn't really go for my shots. I kept waiting for a mistake. It didn't happen. ""She played really great. Especially in the tough moments I felt she was raising her game. I had to stay tough as well."" Azarenka meets pal Daniela Hantuchova in the quarterfinals having captured two of their four previous encounters. Three of the matches have gone the distance. Former French Open winner Li Na of China achieved a first U.S. Open semifinal by overcoming tricky Russian Ekaterina Makarova 6-4 6-7 6-2 and there was more drama in the men's fourth round as Russia's Mikhail Youzhny outlasted fellow veteran Lleyton Hewitt of Australia. Youzhny, previously a semifinalist in New York, upended the 2001 champion 6-3 3-6 6-7 6-4 7-5 in four hours. Having blown a 5-2 lead in the fourth, Hewitt broke Youzhny to get back on serve in the fifth. Youzhny subsequently broke at 5-5 and served out the match. Youzhny next confronts Djokovic, a 6-3 6-0 6-0 winner over a seemingly weakened Granollers. Granollers' first three matches went to five sets and he also played doubles in New York.","Victoria Azarenka beats Ana Ivanovic in three sets to reach the U.S. Open quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- Last weekend, actor Jim Carrey tweeted that he has decided to withdraw his support for his movie ""Kick-Ass 2"" due to its violent content. Carrey said he became uncomfortable with the violence in light of last year's tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. People must make their own decisions about what media are appropriate for themselves and their family, and I respect Carrey's choices. Yet, as someone who researches media violence, I worry that some will draw the wrong message from his position. Existing data do not link media violence with mass shootings or other societal violence. Debate continues in the general public and within academia, but the evidence just isn't there. The U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Department of Education, in a joint report in 2002, found no evidence that school shooters consume more violent media than others. And although media probably have become more violent in recent decades, this period has also seen a massive decline in youth violence to 40-year lows, not an increase. Experimental evidence from social science has been mixed, and many of the studies are of poor quality. One scholarly paper that endorsed the ""harm"" view suggested religious books with violence such as the Bible would cause aggression just as much as a violent movie, something of which readers may wish to be aware. The U.S. Supreme Court rightfully rejected evidence such as this as unpersuasive when considering the Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association violent video game case in 2011. So why do beliefs about media violence persist? Periods of moral panic tend to surround media. Media from penny dreadfuls (trashy novels popular in the 19th century) to comic books to music (jazz, Elvis Presley, rock music, etc.) to books such as Harry Potter have often been blamed for society's ills. After events such as the Sandy Hook rampage, blaming the media can actually be reassuring. We construct the narrative that an individual such as Adam Lanza might never have committed his horrific crimes if not for the crucial influence of media. Such narratives give us a sense that the uncontrollable might be controlled. And to maintain them, we simply ignore cases that don't fit them, such as a rash of violence in the months after Sandy Hook committed by elderly men with no discernible connection to violent media. This allows us to maintain an illusion of correlation where none exists. Professional advocacy groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics share some of the blame in promoting unnecessary fears. As I detail in a recent report for the journal American Psychologist, previous statements by the group have been error-prone on even basic details, such as the number of studies, and simply omit those studies that conflict with alarmist messages. Unfortunately, people often take these policy statements too seriously, forgetting professional advocacy groups tend to benefit politically by identifying social crises their professions can help ""fix."" The committees that write these statements have historically included scholars highly invested in a particular ideological view of media reviewing their own work and declaring it beyond debate (a chance I'd love to have with my own work one day). They should not be mistaken for careful, neutral, objective reviews. There are real dangers in focusing too much on media as the cause of violent crime. Speaking as a mental health provider, I've seen no tangible improvement in the delivery of mental health services in the United States. It is a tragic, lost opportunity when we squabble over the old culture wars surrounding media, rendering media bashing as the new ""Twinkie defense"" for criminal defendants. Parents certainly deserve to have full information on ratings systems for media and existing controls. A recent Harris Poll suggested that individuals unfamiliar with the Entertainment Software Rating Board ratings systems for games, for instance, were those most concerned about video games -- suggesting that, as with previous moral panics, unfamiliarity breeds fear. Granted, media companies could work more -- in conjunction with schools perhaps -- to keep parents informed about the options available to them to restrict their children's exposure to violent imagery (and for the record I have no financial or personal ties to media industries). But parents also have the right to have a full understanding of the research, its inconsistencies and limitations, and this is something the research community could do better. Debates on media have been going on for more than 2,000 years and won't end in our lifetimes. But we must remember that the most powerful impact these debates have is in their ability to distract us from the real causes of violence: poverty, inequality and the lack of attention to mental health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher J. Ferguson.","Christopher Ferguson: Actor tweeted he won't support his new movie due to violence .

"(CNN) -- Two firefighting boats were moved to a safe distance Wednesday as they awaited help in fighting a fire that erupted on a natural gas rig in the Gulf of Mexico, officials say. ""A third vessel equipped with firefighting capability and (an) improved monitoring system"" was expected to arrive around midday, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. A Coast Guard cutter was on hand to ""assess the situation and enforce the security zone,"" it said, while another was on the way. Forty-four workers were evacuated from the rig earlier Tuesday after a blowout occurred, officials said. Crew members aboard the Hercules 265, leased by Houston-based Walter Oil & Gas Corp., were preparing the well for production when they hit an unexpected pocket of gas. No injuries were reported. Natural gas was leaking at the site, but no oil was being released, the BSEE said after it and the Coast Guard sent flights over the rig Wednesday morning. ""There is no observed sheen on the water surface,"" the safety bureau said in a news release. ""As the rig fire continues, the beams supporting the derrick and rig floor have folded and have collapsed over the rig structure,"" which is in about 150 feet of water, it said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Congressional Republicans tore into the Obama administration over the economic stimulus plan Wednesday, arguing that the White House is mishandling the distribution of the money while overstating the ability of the package to create jobs. President Obama says his administration would not want to  change its approach to the stimulus plan. They criticized the White House for referring to the number of ""jobs created or saved"" by the $787 billion package -- a metric, they claimed, that is impossible to verify. The White House Office of Management and Budget defended the plan, arguing that every federal dollar spent has, by definition, helped to ease the pain of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The Republican and Democratic leaders traded their arguments during a contentious hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""In selling the stimulus package, the administration promised the American people that [the] legislation would create or save 3.5 million jobs and prevent the U.S. unemployment rate from rising above 8 percent,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California. ""I believe that the discredited Keynesian theory behind the effort is misguided, and I am convinced that it won't work,"" said Issa, referring to the theories of economist John Maynard Keynes. ""Unfortunately, recent economic data has validated my opposition."" The economy has shed 3.4 million jobs over the past six months, according to the Department of Labor. The unemployment rate rose for the ninth straight month in June, climbing to 9.5 percent and hitting a 26-year high. ""From the moment he was elected, the president has put the economy front and center,"" countered Rob Nabors, deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. ""We are slowing the economic freefall [and] the recovery act is an important part of that effort. ... It's a work in progress, but it's steady progress."" Nabors said the reported loss of 467,000 jobs in June was disappointing, but it nevertheless represented an improvement from the 691,000 jobs lost on average in the first three months of the year. Republicans also criticized the use of stimulus funds to extend unemployment insurance. That kind of spending, while beneficial in some ways, does not ""dollar for dollar, create or save a job,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said. ""I don't see how you can say that,"" Nabors replied. ""We believe that any dollar spent in the federal system will create or save a job, because what's going on is we are putting dollars into people's pockets to spur demand."" Congressional Democrats offered mixed reviews, arguing that the package was necessary, but improvements could be made in its implementation. ""Frankly, there is good news and bad news,"" said the committee's chairman, Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-New York. ""The good news is that money is flowing from the federal government to the states at a faster rate than the Congressional Budget Office predicted at the beginning of this year."" The bad news, he said, is a General Accounting Office finding of ""significant shortcomings in the targeting and tracking of recovery act spending."" Stimulus money should be primarily directed toward economically distressed areas, Towns said, but states vary substantially as to what constitutes such an area. Although many leading Republicans say the stimulus plan has been a waste of money, some economists -- like Nobel Prize winner and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman -- have argued the original measure was too small. Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday that the administration ""misread how bad the economy was,"" but he told ABC's ""This Week"" that the pace of the stimulus program would be increasing. Speaking on NBC's ""The Today Show,"" Obama on Tuesday said ""rather than say 'misread,' we had incomplete information."" He also told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that ""there's nothing that we would have done differently. ""We needed a stimulus and we needed a substantial stimulus,"" he said. Democratic leaders in Congress are now kicking around the idea of another stimulus. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday he would consider supporting a second economic stimulus bill, but added that people need to give the package that passed in February more time to work. The president said he's not taking the idea off the table, and one of his top economic advisers has already called for one. Republicans, however, have accused the White House of not getting its story straight. ""They said the stimulus was necessary to jumpstart the economy. Yet now, with about a half million jobs lost every single month, they've started to admit that they simply 'misread' the economy. These were costly mistakes, and we can't take them back,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. Despite a tough year for Republicans, GOP strategists say the economy is part of the party's road to recovery. ""Nothing has really galvanized the Republican Party more than the stimulus vote,"" Republican strategist Doug Heye said. ""One thing that we've seen is that the president's popularity, while he's still popular throughout the nation, really is taking hits in key states."" CNN's Jim Acosta and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: GOP says White House is exaggerating effectiveness of stimulus .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Fidel Castro has never been accused of wanting for opinions, but the former Cuban leader's Tuesday commentary stumped many of his fellow citizens. The subject was not the bloodshed in Syria or the economic crisis in Europe, but yoga. Yoga? ""Yoga does things with the human body that defy the imagination,"" Castro wrote in a front-page editorial in the island's state-run Granma newspaper. The 35-word ode to the Eastern art of meditation and stretching was the latest ""Reflection from Comrade Fidel,"" a newspaper column dedicated to Castro's musings that has appeared regularly since he stepped down from power in 2006 due to a mystery illness. Castro's praising of yoga, which according to Granma, occurred at 2:40 p.m. on Monday, did not include whether Castro himself was a practitioner. The column was atypically short for the famously verbose former head of state. Opinion: Is Castro Cuban-American's Hitler? Since his illness, Castro's ""Reflection"" opinion pieces often have filled whole pages in the newspaper -- not a difficult task for a world leader who in his heyday spoke for hours without notes on a variety of subjects. But in recent weeks, Castro's published opinions resemble microburst streams of consciousness more akin to a Twitter message than a formal treatise. ""He thought of himself as a wise man and, doubtless, he was. But he made a small mistake,"" Castro wrote Friday about an apparent long-ago rift with former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. ""Cuba has to be punished,"" Castro wrote that Deng said. ""Our country never even pronounced his name."" Deng died in 1997 and it is not clear what punishment Castro referred to. Another ""Reflection"" praised former East German leader Erich Honecker, who Castro wrote was the ""most revolutionary German I have known."" ""I had the privilege of observing his conduct,"" Castro continued in the brief column. ""When he was paying bitterly for the debt contracted by the man who sold his soul to the devil for a few shots of vodka."" ""The man"" selling his soul for vodka was not identified, sparking a debate among Cubans, some thinking Castro meant former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, a reputed lover of the beverage. Others argued he meant former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, whose reforms helped lead to the end of the Soviet empire and to vital economic aid from the USSR to Cuba. Raul Castro's daughter endorses Obama . For his Monday ""Reflection,"" Castro switched topics from politics to farming, authoring a one-sentence endorsement of the moringa olefeira and mulberry plants for their nutritional benefits. The brief and sometimes cryptic ""Reflections"" have also stirred debate in Miami, where Castro's health is an oft-discussed topic among the city's large Cuban-American community. Castro has not been seen publicly since March,when video was shown of him meeting with Pope Benedict XVI during the pontiff's visit to Cuba. In the video, Castro appeared frail and had to be assisted while he walked. ""It may be that he is not coherent enough to write longer 'Reflections,'"" said professor Jaime Suchlicki of the University of Miami. ""But it's clear even if Fidel Castro is no longer in the limelight, he is not ready to stop talking just yet.""","Since his illness, Castro has written regular ""Reflection"" newspaper commentaries .

"(CNN) -- Vowing to keep fighting for his son Trayvon -- even after the man who killed him, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of murder -- Tracy Martin said Wednesday that his family wants to turn ""negative energy"" surrounding their plight ""into a positive."" ""There's nothing that we can do to bring Trayvon Martin back,"" Tracy Martin said in Washington. ""But if there's something that we can do ... to help other families from going through this, then we're here."" Martin spoke at a Capitol Hill forum entitled, ""The Status of Black Males: Ensuring Our Boys Mature Into Strong Men,"" which is the first such event run by the Congressional Caucus on Black Men and Boys. The group's co-chair, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, explained the forum aimed to address ""issues ... spread across the spectrum of the life of black males in America today, clothed in stereotypes from their years as boys, as youth, and finally as men."" ""We seek a society that does not define black men and boys, but allows African-American men and boys to define themselves as individuals,"" said Holmes Norton, who is a nonvoting member of Congress representing the District of Columbia. The evening of February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin was walking back from a convenience store to the Sanford, Florida, home of his father's fiancee when he got into a confrontation with Zimmerman. The 17-year-old ended up dead, a shooting Zimmerman argued was in self-defense. The case soon captivated the nation's attention, shining a light on matters such as race and gun laws, including when or if a person should be able to legally shoot another. Tens of thousands attended rallies demanding Zimmerman's arrest and accused him of wrongly profiling Martin as a troublemaker. Many more people were glued to their televisions during Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial. That trial ended with a not guilty verdict late on Saturday, July 13, vindicating Zimmerman's supporters, who believed his actions were understandable for a man who feared for his life. This sentiment wasn't shared by many at Wednesday's event on Capitol Hill. Still, Holmes Norton said she hopes Martin's story -- which she said has ""focused attention on black males as nothing else has in decades"" -- will compel Americans to rethink how they look at black boys and men. Zimmerman helps family out of overturned SUV . One of those is Trayvon Martin himself, whom Tracy Martin said has had ""his name slandered and demonized."" ""My message to the world (is) that we won't let this verdict sum up who Trayvon was,"" the father said. ""I vow to do everything in my power not to give up my fight for him."" Central to that effort is the Trayvon Martin Foundation, which was founded in March 2012 by Tracy Martin and Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton. According to its website, the nonprofit group's purpose is to ""create awareness of how violent crime impacts the families of the victims and to provide support and advocacy for those families."" Harkening back to his own child's violent death, Tracy Martin said Wednesday that he hopes parents, mentors and others nationwide will ask themselves what they can do ""to prevent this from happening to your child."" ""We've taken that negative energy ... and we're trying to turn it into a positive,"" Tracy Martin said, referring to the uproar over his son's death and later Zimmerman's acquittal. ""What we can do tomorrow -- as a nation, as a people -- to stop someone else's child from being killed is certainly a positive.""","Trayvon Martin's father speaks at a Capitol Hill event run by members of Congress .

"(CNN) -- Maya is about to become the most famous CIA operative since Valerie Plame. Except that's not her real name. We're not allowed to know her real name. Maya is the name of her character in the film ""Zero Dark Thirty"", which is already generating controversy for its depiction of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. This has an only-in-Washington feel, a collision between our celebrity culture and the need to protect our spies from having their identities exposed. So the operative somehow becomes a movie star (played by Jessica Chastain) while remaining in the shadows. Perhaps inevitably, questions are mounting about the CIA employee, her personality and her contacts with the filmmakers. And she can't properly defend herself because she's not allowed to talk to the press. Thus it was that the Washington Post ran a highly unusual front-page profile of someone whose name is unknown. The woman was passed over for a promotion, the story says, and is an abrasive sort who e-mailed colleagues saying they didn't deserve to share in a prestigious award she received for her role in the mission. (By the way, what does it take to get a government promotion if helping eliminate the world's top terrorist doesn't qualify?) Watch: Is Zero Dark Thirty coverage unfair to female CIA operative? In the movie, Maya seems to have a messianic streak, saying after a female colleague was killed during an attack in Afghanistan: ""I believe I was spared so I could finish the job."" Did the real-life Maya actually say that? Who knows? Kathryn Bigelow, the director, says she tried to approach the project as a journalist. But even the best docudramas tend to mix reconstructed facts with cinematic liberties. 'Zero Dark Thirty's' screenwriter on interrogation debate . Zero Dark Thirty is generating plenty of controversy, before its opening next week, because it spends roughly half an hour showing an al-Qaeda detainee being waterboarded, beaten and stripped naked in front of Maya in the quest for information on bin Laden's whereabouts. CNN analyst Peter Bergen says the film could provide ""the misleading picture that coercive interrogation techniques used by the CIA on al Qaeda detainees -- such as waterboarding, physical abuse and sleep deprivation -- were essential to finding bin Laden."" It's hardly surprising that this has become the film's flash point. Liberals and conservatives in this country spent much of the Bush years arguing over whether waterboarding is torture and whether such coercive techniques, whatever they are called, helped or hurt in the war on terror. Watch: Jon Stewart, media critic, takes on Fox News . From a filmmaker's point of view, torture scenes are obviously more exciting than a CIA staffer quietly piecing together clues. And the controversy will spur box-office sales. But Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal deny taking a stance about the role of torture in the pursuit of bin Laden. ""This movie has been and will continue to be put in political boxes,"" Boal told The Wrap. ""Before we even wrote it, some people said it was an Obama campaign commercial, which was preposterous. And now it's pro-torture, which is preposterous."" Watch: From Joe Scarborough to Rush Limbaugh, the conservative media meltdown . But the pro-Obama suggestion is, well, less than preposterous. Bigelow made this film with the help of officials at the Pentagon, CIA and White House who provided her with extraordinary access. President Obama makes only a brief appearance, but the movie highlights the biggest success of his first term, culminating a manhunt that began after the 9/11 attacks. The film can only help burnish his reputation, and the cooperation began soon after one of the most classified missions in U.S. history. When a director gets that kind of official help, it raises troubling questions about the objectivity of those rendering the instant history. Opinion: Did torture really net bin Laden? In an e-mail to the Pentagon last year, CIA spokeswoman Marie Harf wrote: ""I know we don't 'pick favorites' but it makes sense to get behind the winning horse. ... Mark and Kathryn's movie is going to be the first and the biggest. It's got the most money behind it, and two Oscar winners on board. It's just not a close call."" Watch: The Pope tweets -- how Twitter scours the globe for VIPs . Bigelow has every right to work whatever sources she can, and every administration tries to influence media coverage, but rarely do Hollywood and government work so obviously hand in glove. As for Maya, we may never learn whether she liked her portrayal in ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Valerie Plame was outed against her will; even if Maya's real-life counterpart decides to resign and go public, she would be prohibited by secrecy agreements from discussing her role in the mission. The most likely outcome is that the CIA operative who helped nab bin Laden will remain an unknown if flawed heroine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: 'Maya' in new film on finding bin Laden is based on real, but anonymous, operative .

"Washington (CNN) -- Vegas stole the slogan. But cruise ships can also lay claim: Whatever happens on cruise ships, stays on cruise ships. Only a tiny portion of alleged crimes on cruise ships is ever publicly disclosed, according to a report by the Senate Commerce Committee. Of 959 crimes reported to the FBI since 2011, only 31 were disclosed on a web site maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard. As a consequence, passengers have an incomplete picture of crime on board of ships. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, disclosed the statistics on Wednesday in advance of a hearing on safety and security on cruise ships. Luxury cruise fails surprise health inspection . ""I've been told time and again that cruise lines will change, that things will get better for passengers,"" Rockefeller said in a statement. ""But according to our investigation, it doesn't appear to me that passengers are substantially safer."" In 2007, the FBI, Coast Guard and the cruise lines agreed that the industry would voluntarily report to the FBI incidents involving serious violations of U.S. law, including homicide, suspicious death, missing U.S. nationals, kidnapping, assault with bodily injury, sexual assaults, firing or tampering with vessels, and theft greater than $10,000. Three years later, Congress ordered the Coast Guard to maintain a web-based statistical record of alleged crimes. But the site discloses only incidents no longer under investigation, giving the public an incomplete picture, Rockefeller said. Rockefeller has introduced legislation that would require industry to disclose all crime alleged on cruise ships, and beef up video surveillance of public areas. It also would give the Department of Transportation the lead agency for cruise ship consumer protection, akin to its role in aviation. 5 things we've learned about cruising . Crime on cruise ships, though infrequent, presents special problems, Rockefeller said. ""If someone steals your property or assaults you on a cruise ship, you cannot call 911 and have the police there in a few minutes. You can only call the ship's security officers, who also happen to be employees of the cruise line,"" he said in written remarks. ""Under current law, cruise ship crime report data is not available to the public. That means consumers have no way to find out what their real risks are before they book a cruise."" The industry emphasizes that crimes are infrequent. For instance, two big cruise companies, Carnival and Royal Caribbean, reported a combined seven incidents in the quarter ending June 30. All were either assaults involving serious bodily injury or sexual assaults. ""There is nothing more important to us than the safety of our guests,"" Carnival says on its web site. ""Public reporting requirements ... are unique to the cruise industry and similar requirements do not exist for other travel suppliers such as airlines, hotels and theme parks.""

And let's not forget ""Animal Practice,"" the network's previously cancelled comedy this season. And there still could be more carnage to come. We're also awaiting word on the fates of freshman comedies Go On and The New Normal, along with perpetual underdog veteran ""Community."" What has survived? NBC renewed ""Parks & Recreation"" for a sixth season today. ""Parks"" is NBC's best-performing show on Thursday night's after The Office, though it has an average adults 18-49 rating that's less than one third of CBS' Thursday leader ""The Big Bang Theory"" (2.0 vs. 6.2). NBC announced earlier that it will partly restock its lineup with a few new comedies. Highlights include Sean Hayes in Sean Saves the World, about a guy who must figure out how to parent his 14-year-old daughter, and a TV series version of the 2002 film ""About a Boy,"" starring David Walton as a bachelor whose primary goal in life is avoiding any kind of responsibility until he meets a geeky young boy. 'Community' finale: The end (for now?) But NBC will have a tough time regaining its former legendary Thursday night comedy dominance. CBS made serious inroads into the evening with ""Big Bang"" and ""Two and a Half Men"" frequently ruling the 8 p.m. hour. Recently CBS experimented with putting repeats of other comedies into the 9 p.m. hour, raising the possibility of a full-scale two-hour comedy invasion into the evening next fall. Expect more NBC and CBS prime-time moves over the next several days as broadcasters prepare for their upfront presentations in New York City next week. NBC will announce its new fall schedule on Sunday and CBS will unveil its plans on Wednesday. See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Prepackaged salad mix has been pinpointed as the source of an outbreak of cyclospora -- an intestinal illness tied to a rare type of parasite -- that has sickened scores of people in Iowa and Nebraska, health authorities in those states said Tuesday. More than 100 Iowans and 78 Nebraskans have fallen ill with the disease since last month, those states' health departments said. Five people have been hospitalized as a result in Nebraska, where health officials say new cases of cyclospora are reported daily. Investigations commonly led authorities in both states to conclude that a bagged blend of iceberg and romaine lettuce, red cabbage and carrots is to blame, with Nebraska noting the mix had been prewashed. State and federal authorities are still trying to determine exactly where the product was sold or under what brand name. The Nebraska alert noted that it ""came through national distribution channels"" and that ""locally grown produce is not part of this outbreak."" Fruit-related hepatitis A outbreak spreads . Iowa authorities found that about 80% of those who fell ill had prepackaged salad, but the allegedly tainted product was apparently no longer on grocers' shelves by the time investigators were alerted. The upside of this delay? ""Iowans should continue eating salads as the implicated prepackaged salad mix is no longer in the state's food supply chain,"" said Steven Mandernach, the head of that state's food and consumer safety bureau. Foodborne illness is on the rise . What's happening in Iowa and Nebraska may be linked to 122 cyclospora cases in Texas, that state's department of health services said. As of Tuesday, authorities had not singled out a common source for the Lone Star State's outbreak, which is largely centered in and around Dallas and Fort Worth. The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention has been collaborating with health officials in numerous states since late June trying to pin down what's causing the spate of cyclospora cases. People get the disease by eating food or drinking water that's been contaminated with feces with the parasite, according to the CDC. The ailment -- which strike in places where cyclospora is common, like tropical or subtropical regions, but is occasionally seen in the United States as well -- causes symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss and nausea that can last anywhere from a few days to more than a month.

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman's defense team says people should delve into the ""substance"" of other comments made by a juror who claimed the man who killed Trayvon Martin ""got away with murder."" Juror B29 got it right when she said the six Florida jurors had to follow the law, rather than their hearts, Mark O'Mara said in a statement Friday. The 36-year-old juror, who used only her first name of Maddy out of concerns for her safety, told ABC on Thursday that she and others on the panel felt Zimmerman was guilty, but that wasn't enough. ""I stand by the decision because of the law,"" she said. ""If I stand by the decision because of my heart, he would have been guilty."" She also said, ""George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God."" Juror to ABC: He 'got away with murder' At the beginning of deliberations, Maddy told ABC, she wanted to convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder. But she realized on the second day of deliberations that there wasn't enough proof to convict him of murder or the lesser charge of manslaughter. Juror B29 said the evidence showed that Zimmerman was guilty of killing Martin, 17, in February 2012 at a neighborhood in Sanford, Florida. ""But as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty,"" she told ABC. O'Mara said that the defense acknowledged Zimmerman killed Martin -- in self-defense. He said a ""juror's job is not to decide what a law should be, her job is to apply the facts presented at trial to the laws they are instructed about."" ""We do ask jurors not to reach their verdicts based on what their hearts tell them; for the verdict, a juror must set aside emotions and follow the law,"" said O'Mara. ""Based on her comments, Juror B29 accepted a tremendous burden, set her feelings aside, and cast a verdict based the evidence presented in court and on the law she was provided."" His statement labeled B29 as a ""model juror."" Thursday night, Martin's mother said she was devastated after hearing the juror's comments. ""It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from juror B29, comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true. That George Zimmerman literally got away with murder,"" Sybrina Fulton said in a written statement. ""This new information challenges our nation once again to do everything we can to make sure that this never happens to another child."" Maddy is the second juror to speak about the high-profile case since the all-female jury acquitted Zimmerman earlier this month. She and other jurors also have identified themselves by their numbers from the jury pool. Opinion: What if both were white? Last week, the woman known as Juror B37 told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that Zimmerman ""didn't do anything unlawful"" and was ""justified"" in shooting 17-year-old Martin last year. Zimmerman has been out of the public eye since the jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder on July 13. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin in self-defense. Juror B29 stressed that she and the other jurors took their responsibility seriously. ""I don't want people to think that we didn't think about this, and we didn't care about Trayvon Martin, because we did. We're very sad that it happened to him,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Four-time world soccer player of the year Lionel Messi and his father have paid Spanish authorities $6.6 million after allegedly committing tax fraud between 2007 and 2009. The ""reparatory"" payment was made on August 14 and includes interest, the High Court said in a statement sent to CNN. It covers the period between 2007 and 2009, Spanish media reported. The move comes more than two months after Messi paid $13 million in taxes to cover the tax period of 2010-2011. Messi is due to appear in court on September 17 but one of his lawyers is requesting to ""suspend"" the date of his testimony, according to the statement. A decision is expected within two days. When it went public that he was under investigation, Messi said on his Facebook page that he had done nothing wrong. ""We are surprised about the news, because we have never committed any infringement,"" he said in June. ""We have always fulfilled all our tax obligations, following the advice of our tax consultants, who will take care of clarifying this situation."" The off-field issues haven't affected the Argentine international's performances for Barcelona. He scored all three goals for Barcelona in its 3-2 win at Valencia on Sunday and has netted five league goals in his two games.","Lionel Messi and his father pay $6.6 million after allegedly committing tax fraud .

"If your pants feel tighter than usual, you might begin to suspect that you've gained a couple of pounds. But at what point should you begin to worry that the weight gain is serious? Could you be one of the approximately two-thirds of American adults who are either overweight or obese, with an increased risk for conditions like diabetes and heart disease? While no single measurement is perfect, here are a few ways to size yourself up. Skin-fold tests, which measure skin thickness with calipers, can be inaccurate. Step on the scale . Upside: Easy and handy. In a 2007 study published in the journal Obesity, researchers found that dieters who regularly and frequently weighed themselves appeared more likely to keep the weight off over time. Buying a scale for your bathroom to keep track of weight won't break the bank, and your gym probably has one in the locker room. Downside: You know how you can be skinny but out of shape? Or heavy and fit? Body weight doesn't take into account the proportion of fat in the body, or where that fat is deposited -- factors that can point to health trouble. Also, experts say dieters often make the mistake of fixating on the number between their toes instead of focusing on changing the behavior that can improve it. iReport.com: Have you made a health-changing resolution? Tell us . Body mass index (BMI) Upside: Your BMI provides a lot more information than your bathroom scale, specifically a measure of body fat. ""Fat is more important than weight,"" says Peter Katzmarzyk, associate executive director for population science at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""Excessive fatness is the definition of obesity, not excessive weight -- and having too much fat can cause serious health problems."" This calculation uses a ratio of weight to height to estimate body fat and obesity. Find your BMI » . A BMI of less than 18.5 is underweight. A BMI of 18.5--24.9 is normal. A BMI of 25--29.9 is overweight. A BMI of 30 or higher is obese. Downside: Since the BMI tool cannot distinguish between lean muscle mass and body fat, it has a tendency to overestimate the level of body fat in people who have a lot of muscle -- say, Arnold Schwarzenegger -- and underestimate the amount of body fat in people who have lost muscle mass, such as the elderly. ""If you are an Olympic body builder, it doesn't hold up so well,"" says Miriam Nelson, Ph.D., director of the John Hancock Center for Physical Activity and Nutrition at Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, in Boston, Massachusetts. Nelson notes that BMI still works well for the general population and estimates that it gives an inaccurate assessment in only one to three percent of people, despite its limitations. And if you're looking to compare your BMI with other dieters, think again. Pretty much anyone can rattle off his weight, but only 20 percent of the population knows their BMI, suggests a National Consumers League survey conducted by Harris Interactive last year. Health.com: Six diet trend you should never try . Waist circumference . Upside: Simple and predictive. This measure -- an indicator of abdominal obesity, which is an important predictor of risk for developing obesity-associated cardiovascular disease -- can be conducted at home by wrapping a tape measure snugly around the abdomen slightly above the hipbone, level with the navel. ""It helps reduce even the small number of mistakes that might be made with BMI,"" says Steven R. Smith, M.D., assistant executive director of clinical research at the Pennington Center. In fact, waist circumference may be even more important than BMI. There is a greater risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart disease if a person carries excess fat -- also known as visceral fat -- around his abdomen. Fat located deep in the abdomen around the internal organs may be more dangerous than subcutaneous fat, which is located just under the skin, and peripheral fat found in places like the hips and thighs. Health.com: Lost weight? Here's how to keep it off . Therefore, regardless of height, a person is considered to be at an increased risk of developing an obesity-related disease if his waist circumference is greater than 40 inches or 35 inches, in men and women, respectively. Downside: Unless you're a supermodel, you're probably not in the habit of measuring your waist. In a 2008 study published in the Journal of Women's Health, one in 10 women who underwent various cardiovascular health screenings didn't have their waists measured. Some of the women simply may have refused, suggests senior author Erin D. Michos, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. And busy doctors may resort to the scale rather than take the time to use a tape measure correctly, Michos says. She urges dieters to do the measurement themselves at home. Health.com: Weight-loss success story: Together we lost over 200 pounds . Additionally, Dr. Michos points out, measuring waist circumference may provide a more vivid indication of weight-loss progress. ""When someone starts to exercise, they might increase muscle mass as well, and therefore might be frustrated not to see too much change on the scale in terms of total weight,"" she says. Conversely, if a tape measure reveals a decrease in waist circumference, you can see the benefit and know you're improving your health, which can also motivate you to continue an exercise and diet plan. DEXA scans . Upside: Superaccurate. This low-radiation, full-body X-ray, typically used to screen for osteoporosis, computes body composition and the percentage of fat in the body by measuring fat mass, lean mass, and bone mass. ""They are the gold standard,"" says David Freedman, Ph.D., an epidemiologist in the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. Downside: Cost. Unfortunately, if not covered by insurance, a DEXA scan could end up costing you a couple hundred dollars, an expense that isn't necessary, according to Nelson. Other body fat measurements . Upside: Your wallet won't take such a hit from other more economical approaches. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), which can sometimes be found at health clubs and involves attaching electrodes to the hands and feet or standing on electrode pads, sends a small electric signal through the body to compute the composition of body fat and muscle mass. Some physicians and health clubs also use so-called skin-fold tests, which use calipers or pinchers to measure the thickness of folds of skins at different parts of the body. Downside: These measurements are cheaper, yes, but they are also less reliable than a DEXA scan. The BIA is heavily influenced by hydration levels and thus, can be imprecise; depending on the technician, a skin-fold test can be inaccurate too. Health.com: How foods rich in water can help you lose weight . Bottom line . BMI and waist circumference, along with an evaluation of your personal risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family history for heart disease, should give you a good idea about whether you need to lose weight. If you find that you have a BMI greater than 25 and a high-risk waist circumference, you should discuss your risks and options with a physician. Try a FREE TRIAL issue of Health - CLICK HERE!

"(CNN)  -- Police from California's Bay Area Rapid Transit system have begun questioning witnesses to a confrontation that led to a BART police officer shoving an unruly man into a glass window, a top official said Monday. ""We will take our time and we will cover everything that needs to be covered,"" said Daniel Hartwig, the patrol commander for the BART police force. Hartwig said detectives have identified and begun interviewing 12 witnesses to the confrontation, which occurred Saturday night at the West Oakland BART station. Based what is known so far, Hartwig said, the officer appears to have acted appropriately. The incident was captured on video and posted on the Internet, but has since been taken down. Hartwig said investigators have asked the person who posted the video online for his help, but had not received a response. Police released recordings of 911 calls in which witnesses and a train operator complained that the man arrested, Michael Joseph Gibson, appeared drunk and combative. In a statement issued earlier, BART police said he was ""yelling racial slurs and profanity at passengers and challenging customers to fight."" The video showed Gibson being pulled off the train by an officer who put him in an arm grip and forcibly walked him toward the station wall, which is topped by large windows. In the video, the officer forced Gibson against the window, which shattered. It was unclear exactly what caused the glass to break. The officer sustained facial cuts requiring stitches and a concussion, while Gibson suffered cuts to his hand, forearm, palm and head. The officer was placed on leave due to his injuries, authorities said. Gibson, 37, of San Leandro, California, is to appear in court Tuesday afternoon, according to jail paperwork. He faces charges of battery on a police officer with injury and resisting arrest -- both felonies -- and public intoxication, a misdemeanor. He was being held in a jail outside Oakland on Monday evening. He has refused to talk to detectives investigating the case, Hartwig said. His sister, Lisa Gibson, told CNN on Sunday that her brother was diagnosed with bipolar/schizophrenic disorder and is under a doctor's care. She said he was released from hospitalization earlier this month. Gibson said her brother appears intoxicated in the video. But she blasted the officer who made the arrest, saying, ""Whoever this officer is shouldn't have a job. He has no integrity and a combative mindset."" But Hartwig said police ""can't assume this person was mentally unstable."" Saturday's scuffle is the latest incident to draw attention to BART. Johannes Mehserle, a former BART officer, has been charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed man at a transit station on January 1. He faces trial in Los Angeles County, where a judge moved the trial after the shooting -- also caught on video -- prompted widespread media coverage and protests. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Officer seen on video forcing unruly man into heavy-duty glass, which shattered .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Twenty-four weeks pregnant, Veronica Pacheco went to the emergency room last October with a hacking cough that made it hard to breathe. Tests found she had H1N1 flu, and doctors put her in a coma so her body could continue the gestational process without expending additional energy. ""My life changed forever after that,"" Pacheco said. Six weeks later -- 10 weeks before full term -- her unborn baby's vital signs dropped and doctors performed an emergency C-section. ""When I woke up, my husband said, 'We had to take out the baby' and I immediately clutched my stomach, fearing the worst,"" she said. ""But he settled me down and [said], 'He's OK, he's down in the NICU."" Born 2½ months early, Noah Pacheco weighed less than 3 pounds and was immediately put in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) -- a vital step for premature babies but often financially and emotionally stressful for families. The Pachecos found some relief with the help of Dr. Sean Daneshmand and his nonprofit Miracle Babies. The group provides financial assistance for items such as housing and medical expenses, baby supplies and transportation costs. ""To see people hearing there's something wrong with their baby, and then to worry about everything around them -- I mean, life doesn't stop. You still have to make your mortgage payments,"" said Daneshmand, 41. An obstetrician specializing in high-risk pregnancies since 2002, Daneshmand had watched families struggle to cope with the financial pressures of having a child in the NICU. But in 2004, his wife had complications with her pregnancy that threatened both her and her unborn child. Though Daneshmand had the medical knowledge, support and financial stability to delay a very premature birth -- his daughter was ultimately born six weeks early -- the experience shook him and gave him a new perspective of what his patients go through. ""What we went through was so traumatic, but it's nothing compared to many of my patients,"" he said. ""I wanted to take some of the suffering that these women go through away from them so they can really focus on their baby."" For years, Daneshmand gave patients money out of his own pocket before he started Miracle Babies in November 2009. Now most of the group's funding comes from individual donors and small corporate sponsors. So far, it has helped 80 families in California and across the country, including the Pachecos. ""They helped us with our mortgage, with gas,"" said Veronica Pacheco's husband, Mike. ""It was huge for us."" Families apply for assistance from Miracle Babies through hospital social workers. The application requires proof of financial need, and the baby must be in the NICU for at least two weeks. The group hasn't rejected anyone yet. ""These are families that...[are] in a time of crisis [and] now need extra help. And that's what we're about,"" Daneshmand said. While families supported by the group are primarily located in southern California, they do not have to live in the area to receive aid. Families in the Midwest, Louisiana and on the East Coast have been helped by the program. The average amount a family receives is $1,200; it can be more depending on circumstances. So far, Miracle Babies has provided a total of $70,000 in assistance. If the group's monetary support left an impression on families, so has Daneshmand's compassion. ""Dr. Daneshmand made me feel very at ease,"" said first-time parent Sofia Diouri, who at just 24 weeks pregnant had to have an emergency C-section earlier this month due to excessive bleeding. ""He made me feel like everything was going to be OK, even though it could have gone tragic in a matter of seconds."" With her less-than-2-pound daughter Mya hooked up to a breathing apparatus and several IVs, Diouri said, ""It's hard seeing her struggle. ... You don't think all these problems are going to happen. But it's all real life now and it is really hard."" Miracle Babies helped ease some of that suffering for Diouri and her partner, Roy Coronado. The organization paid for housing near the hospital so they wouldn't have to travel hours each day to be with their daughter -- something they couldn't have afforded on their own. For Daneshmand, the main goal is to help these families be happy, healthy and together. ""I want to see others be happy. ... That's what drives me, that's what makes me get up in the mornings ... that's what makes me want to do more,"" he said. ""I can't think of really any other time in one's life where you need someone to be there for you."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- iPhone and iPad users looking with envy at the ever-ballooning screen sizes of Android devices shouldn't lose hope just yet. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple has been experimenting with iPhone screen sizes larger than the current four inches, echoing rumors from earlier this year that the company may be looking to supplement its current offerings. The WSJ also says that Apple is experimenting with larger iPads, specifically a model with a gigantic 13-inch display. While a larger iPhone would be in line with current trends, the trend in tablets has been toward smaller screen sizes, not larger ones. In either case, those hoping for a bigger iPhone or lap-sized iPad shouldn't necessarily hold their breath. Apple regularly tests out new screen sizes and even brand-new product lines without ever bringing them to market; those that do see the light of day can take their time emerging from Apple's labs. The iPad mini itself was the subject of similar speculation in the months and years before it was finally released, and the iPhone 5's 4-inch screen was the subject of rumors that predate the 3.5-inch iPhone 4S. Apple is expected to update both the iPad and the iPad mini later this year. Speculation is that the larger tablet will go on the iPad mini diet, shedding some weight, thickness, and bezel width. The smaller tablet, on the other hand, may or may not receive a high-resolution Retina display -- these rumors have been known to change daily based on what the folks at Apple rumor sites see in their tea leaves each morning.

"Rome (CNN) -- Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has lashed out at a ruling by the country's high court that upheld a prison sentence for him in a tax fraud case. In a nine-minute video on Thursday, an indignant and defiant Berlusconi vented his anger over the court's decision. ""In exchange for the commitments I have made over almost 20 years in favor of my country and coming almost at the end of my public life, I receive as a reward accusations and a verdict that is founded on absolutely nothing, that takes away my personal freedoms and my political rights,"" he said. ""That is how Italy recognizes the sacrifices and commitments of its best citizens?"" Berlusconi wondered out loud. ""Is this the Italy that we love? Is this the Italy that we want? Absolutely not. The high court had said earlier Thursday that it supported a lower court's four-year prison sentence for Berlusconi. Three years of that sentence are covered in an amnesty aimed at cutting down on prison overcrowding, effectively reducing Berlusconi's sentence to one year. The high court also ordered a lower court to reconsider whether Berlusconi, 76, should be banned from public office -- a controversial issue that could play a key role in the country's political future. A lower court convicted Berlusconi of tax evasion last October, sentencing him to four years in prison and barring him from public office for five years. In May, an Italian appeals court in Milan upheld that decision. The former prime minister can't appeal the high court's decision in the case. But it's unlikely he'll spend time behind bars, because of his age and the shortness of the sentence. Berlusconi is a member of Italy's Senate and therefore enjoys immunity from any type of arrest. The Senate would have to vote to have his immunity lifted in order to serve any sentence. Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, is one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of Italian politics. A look at the life of Silvio Berlusconi . For years, he has been entangled in fraud, corruption and sex scandals that have often reached Italian courts. In June, a panel of judges sentenced Berlusconi to seven years in prison for abusing power and having sex with an underage prostitute. Berlusconi's attorney told reporters he plans to appeal that conviction. Undaunted by the court battles, Berlusconi has not only launched appeals, but in December made two significant announcements: his engagement to 27-year-old Francesca Pascale, and then, his political comeback. In Italy's February elections, the three-time prime minister appealed to Italian voters by denouncing the unpopular austerity policies of technocrat Mario Monti. For all his critics, Berlusconi won almost 30% of the vote in February and remains an influential figure in Prime Minister Enrico Letta's fragile coalition government. CNN's Becky Anderson, Peter Wilkinson and Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","NEW: Berlusconi lambasts a court ruling against him, saying it's baseless .

"New York (CNN) -- ""Before my mother's ... experience, I never even looked at seniors on the street,"" said Irene Zola. ""They were pretty much invisible to me."" In 2008, Zola's mother, Faye, was admitted into a nursing home after suffering a stroke. ""I knew from that very first night I would have to spend a lot of time there,"" she said. ""I didn't want to leave my mother in a place where people were ignoring her."" Four months later, Zola's mother passed away. ""I was outraged that our culture doesn't have a place for very old people except in nursing homes,"" she said. ""I decided that I wanted to do something about that."" A New York native and 30-year resident of Morningside Heights -- a neighborhood on Manhattan's upper west side -- Zola researched the senior population and how their needs were being met and found a solution in her own backyard. ""[A] friend said, 'What about having some people in our neighborhood taking care of the elders who live here?' "" Borrowing on that idea, Zola started Morningside Village in 2009, an initiative that pairs the elderly in her neighborhood with local volunteers who assist them with their day-to-day needs. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . ""Sometimes it'll be a stroll, or shopping or helping them pay their bills. We're their daughters and sons helping them to manage their home life,"" said Zola, 64. All the seniors and most of the volunteers live within a 24-block area. Volunteers range in age from 18 to 81 and include college and graduate students, doctors, lawyers and social workers. ""I wanted to establish something to support the aging-in-place community and bring people across generations together,"" Zola said. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 40 million people older than 65 live alone. That number is expected to grow as baby boomers reach their twilight years. ""Families are living far away from their older mother [or] father. So who's there to take care of old people?"" Zola said. Older parents often don't tell their children about their needs because they fear being a burden or being put into a nursing home. ""This is one way a community can help provide informal care that really makes a difference in the lives of the old people,"" she said. Morningside Village is just one initiative of Zola's nonprofit, S.O.S., Support Our Seniors. In addition to its efforts to improve the quality of elder care, the group hosts an annual awards event to honor older adults and is working with educators to create high school and college courses to increase the visibility of the elderly. All Morningside Village volunteers go through the group's application process and orientation. They are advised how to interact with seniors and given wheelchair and emergency training. Zola pairs a veteran volunteer with a novice and then teams them up with a senior with similar interests. In addition to companionship, volunteers provide a wide range of assistance tailored to the needs of the elders, including help with home management, grocery shopping and meal preparation as well as accompanying them to doctor's appointments. For 96-year-old Dolores Saborido, Zola's group not only helps her face the challenges of living independently, it also provides her with hope. In the past year, Saborido has fallen twice. The second fall left her bedridden and depressed until a friend introduced her to Zola. ""When I first met Dolores she spent her days thinking about how her casket would look,"" Zola said. ""We got her a whole team of doctors, and now she has six to seven visits from Support Our Seniors' volunteers every week. She doesn't talk about caskets anymore."" About 50 volunteers are tending to the needs of 27 elders. Zola believes that by limiting its reach, the group can maximize the feeling of community.

"(CNN) -- Two Syrian Orthodox bishops remain missing two days after being kidnapped, with each side in the civil war blaming others for the snatching. The whereabouts of the two prominent clergymen, Greek Orthodox Bishop Paul Yazigi and Syriac Orthodox Bishop John Ibrahim, remain unknown, despite some reports to the contrary, Greek Orthodox Bishop Mousa Khoury told CNN. There have been several kidnappings of Christian clergymen in Syria but the two bishops are the most senior church figures who have been abducted since the beginning of the uprising. The Syrian regime's Ministry of Religious Endowment issued a statement blaming ""this brutal act"" on Chechen mercenaries operating under the mantle of Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaeda. The government did not provide evidence to back up the claim. A spokesman for the Free Syrian Army said the government itself could be behind the kidnappings. ""The timing is very suspicious and we believe the Assad regime is behind the kidnapping,"" Louay Almokdad told CNN. Another opposition figure, Rami Abdurrahman of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, elaborated, saying they believe that non-Arab foreign fighters are behind the kidnappings. ""We know that there are foreign fighters who are infiltrated by the regime and the Assad regime is well known for being a ventriloquist of proxy groups that they set up in order to spread chaos, strife and to divide the ranks of the opposition,"" he said. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims by either side. Earlier, there were conflicting reports about the status of the bishops. ""The bishops were supposed to be released by the armed group yesterday evening; then we expected them to head back to their churches. But they didn't, so we are still carrying out all efforts to figure out what happened,"" Abdel Ahad Steifo, a prominent Syriac member of Syria's main opposition group, told CNN. Steifo, who is in charge of the negotiations for the release of the clergymen, says he does not know the identity of the kidnappers. But they are not part of the opposition, he said. In an interview with the Vatican's Fides News Agency, the Chaldean bishop of Aleppo, Antoine Audo, said that at the root of the ""scourge of kidnapping"" is not politics, but ""the pursuit of money on behalf of armed gangs."" Recent incidents of clergymen being kidnapped ended with their release after ransoms of thousands of dollars were paid, he said. On Tuesday, the director of the Holy See press office, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Pope Francis is closely following the events in Syria. The pope is ""praying for the health and the liberation of the two kidnapped bishops,"" Lombardi said. A number of Muslim clerics have also been killed and kidnapped in Syria, including a top Sunni cleric and longtime supporter of President Bashar al-Assad, Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Bouti, who was killed in a suspicious blast while teaching religious class in Damascus. Rebels and regime officials blamed each other for the assassination of al-Bouti.

"(CNN) -- Formula One's highest-paid driver Fernando Alonso is splashing out on his own team but his new venture relies on pedal power instead of horsepower. The double Formula One world champion, who earns over $30 million a year according to Forbes, has decided to save the cash-strapped Spanish Euskaltel Euskadi cycling team. ""We are pleased to announce that the Spanish sportsman has reached an initial agreement to buy the cycling team and so avoid its demise,"" said a statement on Alonso's personal website. Euskaltel added in a statement: ""During the next few weeks negotiations will be finalized [to] formally give Alonso the acquisition of Basque Pro Cycling, which owns the team. ""The agreement guarantees the continuity of the Euskaltel Euskadi team in the elite of world cycling from 2014. ""This guarantees a new future... Euskaltel wants to thank and emphasize respect, understanding and love that Fernando Alonso has shown for the team, its practitioners, its historical legacy and his hobby."" Euskaltel Euskadi was famous for only employing riders born in the Basque region of northern Spain -- as well its bright orange cycling lycra team kit. The team changed its selection criteria in 2012 and now employs riders from other regions of Spain as well as Slovenia, Morocco, Germany and Russian. But the team feared it would have to quit cycling's World Tour at the end of the 2013 season after losing sponsorship from the Basque authorities because of the economic downturn in Spain. The team confirmed to CNN that Eustkaltel, the leading telecommunications company in the Basque region, had paid more than 7m euros to keep the team going in 2013 but could not afford to continue to fund the team alone next season."" Alonso's decision to step in and spend some of his annual salary from Ferrari has effectively saved the team. The racer has been motivated by patriotism as well as his other passion -- cycling. Two-wheeled racers . The 32 year old Spaniard regularly cycles as part of his training regime and he is not alone in his passion for cycling within F1's fraternity. Red Bull racer Mark Webber is also a keen amateur cyclist, although the Australian broke his leg after being knocked off his bike before the 2009 F1 season. McLaren's Jenson Button and Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg both ride as part of their triathlon training while French four time world champion Alain Prost says cycling has become his ""all consuming passion"" since quitting F1. Alonso, who chose to move back from Switzerland to Spain in part to help his homeland through its economic crisis, now plans to help turn around the fortunes of the Euskaltel team. ""As of today we will start to work against the clock,"" the statement on the racer's website said. ""With maximum effort and humility, and transferring the best of our professional experience, in order to be capable of starting the first races of the 2014 season with a new team, full of desire and with a fighting spirit.""","Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso agrees a deal to buy the Spanish Euskaltel Euskadi cycling team .

"(CNN) -- A sharp-witted impala in South Africa's Kruger National Park evaded almost certain death when it came up with a novel escape plan. In the midst of being hotly pursued by a pair of cheetahs, the impala leaped though the open window of an SUV filled with safari tourists. The thrilling chase and bold escape were captured on video by a South African tourist in a companion vehicle. ""We started freaking out, going crazy; we couldn't believe it, we were absolutely dumbstruck,"" said 20-year-old Samantha Pittendrigh, who shot the video on July 5. ""All of a sudden we saw the impala jump out of the bushes and then someone started screaming, 'It is in the car! It is in the car!' ""People in other cars screamed 'Open the door! Open the door!'"" One of the passengers in the vehicle did just that. The impala calmly exited the opposite side of the car within seconds of jumping into it. The mystified cheetahs, meanwhile, abandoned the hunt as soon as their prey had bounded into the vehicle. They watched passively from the bushes as the crafty impala bolted to safety in the brush. ""My family are so jealous,"" said Pittendrigh. ""In all the years my parents have been going to Kruger Park they have never seen anything like it and we do go regularly. ""It really is a once-in-a-lifetime thing and we managed to be in the right place at the right time.""

"(CNN) -- In the rearview mirror of history, the Nixon administration can look monstrous. It features a brilliant but insecure and almost constantly cursing chief executive who ruined a landslide 49-state re-election with a corrupt cover-up of a burglary ordered from within the White House. But what's often forgotten is that Richard Nixon presided over a first term of surprisingly unifying and effective governance amid a time of deep cultural divides -- and that people went to work for him, at the hinge of the 1960s and '70s, with a genuine sense of idealism. CNN Films' brilliant new documentary ""Our Nixon"" offers a firsthand look at the Nixon years from the vantage of his inner circle. The behind-the-scenes footage literally comes from the FBI vaults -- more than 500 reels of Super 8 home movies seized from key aides Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Dwight Chapin before they went to prison for involvement in Watergate. Forty years later, the footage has been rescued from obscurity by filmmaker Penny Lane and edited in a witty way that transports the viewer back to the Nixon era. It is a surreal and illuminating experience. I was born in 1973, the day before Nixon's second inauguration. ""Our Nixon"" offers a glimpse into an America on the periphery of my experience, awkwardly caught in between the crew cuts of the Nixon White House and the longhairs protesting on the Washington Mall. Opinion: The inner demons that drove Nixon . The biggest revelation is Nixon himself, shown in his prime at the film's outset -- tan, tested and ready, confidently meeting with world leaders at a time of maximum American power. This was a man in full before his fall, starting the Environmental Protection Agency, opening relations with Red China and ending U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam. Against this heady backdrop, Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Chapin come across as idealistic and almost giddy with the trappings of power. In the opening credits, the documentary shows Haldeman, Nixon's chief of staff, grinning widely and goofing for the camera over the ironic soundtrack of Tracey Ullman's ""They Don't Know."" Domestic policy adviser Ehrlichman comes across as intelligent and initially independent. Special assistant Chapin looks like a J. Crew model moonlighting in midcentury government, earnestly pronouncing that ""I never laughed as much as when I was in the Nixon White House."" They are finally the stars of their own home movies. But the old axiom that power corrupts quickly becomes apparent as we see and hear (courtesy of the infamous secret taping device) the Nixon aides jockeying for influence and sliding into self-serving group think. At one point, Nixon is caught complaining about an episode of ""All in the Family"" -- a cultural phenomenon he needs explained to him by Haldeman -- and we are treated to this unvarnished Oval Office diatribe. ""Aristotle was a homo. We all know that. So was Socrates,"" Nixon grumbles. ""The last six Roman emperors were fags. ... You see, homosexuality, dope, immorality in general, these are the enemies of strong societies. That's why the communists and left-wingers are pushing the stuff. They're trying to destroy us."" Ehrlichman then joins the presidential pile-on and proclaims the dynamic ""fatal liberality ... a different set of values that has been induced."" This is evidence of the impulse to encourage a boss' worst instincts to curry favor. That instinct ultimately led to the solicitation of the Watergate break-in and other fatal misadventures -- all unnecessary, given Nixon's 1972 landslide mandate. And so slowly the noose tightens around the Nixon inner circle. Opinion: Four lessons from Nixon's failed presidency . Chapin, the last living member of the troika, becomes the first to get thrown under the bus and sent to prison. Nixon is caught on tape trying to claim plausible deniability about the break-ins in a conversation with Ehrlichman, trying to prompt his aide to give him absolution. But under fire Ehrlichman won't play ball. ""I should have been told about that, shouldn't I?"" Nixon asks in a leading question reflecting his legal training. ""Well, I'm not so sure you that you weren't. My recollection is that this was discussed with you,"" Ehrlichman replies. At which point Nixon starts nervously stammering and saying, ""My God."" Ultimately, Nixon reluctantly requests the resignation of his right-hand men, Haldeman and Ehrlichman, in an attempt to cut out the cancer of scandal afflicting his administration. In perhaps the most raw Nixon moment caught on tape, the president asks Haldeman if he did all right by him after announcing his resignation on national television. ""I'm never going to discuss this sonofabitching Watergate thing again,"" Nixon says, softly slurring his words, ""but let me say that you're a strong man and I love you."" The sum total of the film is humanizing to Nixon and the men who surrounded him, capturing the surrealism of life in the White House bubble. These men aren't monsters, however disastrous and devious their actions in the Oval Office ultimately proved to be. ""Our Nixon"" won't satisfy the Nixon haters, of whom there are still many, but it is bracing, engaging history. It accurately reflects the long ago reality of this pivotal failed administration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Documentary looks at Nixon White House from vantage of inner circle .

"(CNN) -- Less than three months after receiving a synthetic windpipe made from her own stem cells, 2-year-old Hannah Warren has passed away. Warren died Saturday at Children's Hospital of Illinois, according to a statement from the hospital. She was the youngest patient to undergo the experimental windpipe procedure and the first patient to receive it in the United States. She would have been 3 years old in August. ""Our hearts are broken,"" her family wrote on their blog. ""We will forever miss her infectious personality and miraculous strength and spirit. ... She is a pioneer in stem-cell technology and her impact will reach all corners of our beautiful Earth."" The Korean-Canadian toddler was born without a trachea -- a condition that's fatal in 99% of cases. She spent every day of her life leading up to the transplant surgery in intensive care, kept alive by a tube that connected her mouth to her lungs. Dr. Paolo Macchiarini, director of the Advanced Center for Translational Regenerative Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, performed Warren's operation on April 9. Her new windpipe that was created using stem cells from the toddler's bone marrow and plastic fibers shaped into a tube. Stem cells are able to develop into different types of body cells and are great at adapting to a new environment. Because of this, the body is less likely to reject organs made from these cells, especially if they come from the patient. Children make ideal patients for regenerative procedures, since they are naturally better than adults at healing and growing new tissue. In the months after surgery, Warren's new trachea was doing well, the family wrote, but her lungs continued to deteriorate. Dr. Mark Holterman, a pediatric surgeon at the hospital, told the New York Times that the trachea operation also involved surgery on the toddler's esophagus, which never healed properly. Macchiarini has performed six of these transplants worldwide. Four of the patients are doing well. The fifth was a cancer patient from Baltimore named Christopher Lyles; he died four months after receiving the synthetic trachea in Sweden, according to the Baltimore Sun. Macchiarini told the Times Sunday that he plans to continue with similar operations, including one he is performing this week in Stockholm. ""Although regenerative medicine remains in the early stages for pediatric patients, progress is being made,"" Children's Hospital of Illinois said in their statement. ""Even at this time of loss and grief, we, and Hannah's family, take comfort in the knowledge that the efforts of her physicians and the care team working with them will benefit and serve other children and adults in the years to come.""

"(CNN) -- Monza may be a long way from his birthplace in West Lothian, Scotland but Italy is unquestionably a home from home for Paul di Resta. The Force India driver's Italian heritage stems from his octogenarian grandfather, Felice who moved to Scotland from the village of Corigliano (an hour's drive north of Naples) during his mid-twenties. But as di Resta prepares for this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, attention isn't so much on the 27-year-old's past but his future and whether he will join Ferrari next season. Uncertainty surrounding Felipe Massa's future -- the Brazilian's contract with the Ferrari F1 team expires at the end of the season -- could mean di Resta's long-harbored dreams of driving for the Italian marque come true sooner than he expects. ""When I was growing up, the Ferrari domination was the biggest thing in Formula One and equally my dad had a Ferrari so the red, with the Italian, the combination, it's always been a dream,"" Di Resta told CNN ahead of Sunday's race. ""It's always the thing I wanted to drive, the car. It sticks out and there is something very special with the prancing horse on the front. ""If I could get that opportunity one day I better grab it with both hands and certainly enable me hopefully to win races and win championships and gain my reputation in F1, one day to look back on. ""But winning races and winning championships is the important bit and that's the ladder that I'm trying to work my way up to at the moment."" Read more: Interactive circuit guide . As a young child Di Resta would frequently travel to Italy for family holidays and his connection with the country provides an added attraction to driving at Monza. ""It's nice to come back and actually see your roots, where it all originated,"" the Force India driver told CNN. ""To be racing on a second home soil, if you want to say for me, it probably makes it that extra little bit special."" ""I've been here obviously lots (as) a young child growing up and (on) family holidays. Equally, when I've been karting back in the day ... we'd always come and stay here for a few days after the race and just to come and see everyone and get to know them,"" he says. ""But it's a bit of a surprise each time you come back. Italian families grow quite fast and there's a lot of young children and a lot of people who make me feel old now!"" Read more: Red Bull choose Ricciardo . A retirement at last month's Belgian Grand Prix at Spa cannot detract from what has been the Scot's most successful season since joining Formula One in 2011. Seven top ten finishes, including a fourth place at Bahrain in April, have helped di Resta to 10th place in the drivers' championship. ""The season so far has been a very positive one for Force India,"" added di Resta. ""To date, it's the most points we've scored. We were fifth in the Constructors' Championship until the last race, unfortunately we lost out to McLaren but it's been difficult with the tire construction change recently. But we're hopeful we can certainly bounce back and Monza is one of the places that generally suits our car."" Read more: Alonso saves cycling team . The historic track located a few miles north of Milan is comfortably the fastest on the calendar, with cars going in excess of 340 kph (211 mph) in certain sections. ""I think what really stands out from other grand prix is that it's a completely different downforce. It's all about top speed,"" di Resta explains. ""The car is moving about a lot -- a lot more than it normally would -- and it usually generates some excellent racing. And to date it's my best qualifying. I qualified fourth, so (I have) high hopes for doing something special this year."" Read more: McLaren celebrate 50th anniversary . A first podium finish would propel the hungry Scot into uncharted territory and provide further evidence of his capabilities in Ferrari's own back yard.

It's more of a family unit ... The way the team works at the moment is exceptional.""","F1 driver Paul di Resta tells CNN about his dream of driving for Ferrari one day .

"(CNN) -- Federal terrorism charges against Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev could be filed soon, even as he remains hospitalized, a Justice Department official told CNN on Saturday. The 19-year-old could also face murder charges at the state level. At the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Tsarnaev was in serious condition while being held in federal custody, federal prosecutors were formulating the charges. The development came amid questions as to what's next for the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. President Barack Obama said he's keenly interested in answers. ""There are still many unanswered questions,"" Obama said Friday night. ""Why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence? How did they plan and carry out these attacks? And did they receive any help? The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers."" Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of setting off bombs at the marathon Monday, killing three people and wounding more than 170. On Thursday night, they allegedly killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer before the older brother was killed during a shootout with police. Dzhokar Tsarnaev was captured Friday night after he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts. When will the suspect be in court? Tsarnaev could be in a courtroom for an arraignment soon. Ordinarily at an arraignment, the suspect is provided a lawyer, and the defense and prosecution try to make a case for whether he should be released on bail. ""He will not get bail obviously,"" said senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""They will set a preliminary hearing that could happen in the next 30 days. He will be indicted with the grand jury. And that's when the case will begin."" After the charges are filed, the Federal Public Defender Office in Boston will be appointed to represent Tsarnaev, according to Miriam Conrad, the federal public defender for the Massachusetts district. Should bomber suspect be questioned without a lawyer? For now, the government is invoking the public safety exception, a designation that allows investigators to question Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights, a Justice Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity. In ordinary cases, a suspect is told by police he has the right to remain silent and he has the right to a lawyer. But this is not an ordinary case, say U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham. They urged that Tsarnaev be held as an ""enemy combatant,"" a designation that allows a suspect to be questioned without a lawyer and without being informed of his Miranda rights. ""Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent. It is absolutely vital the suspect be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes,"" the senators said. ""Under the law of war we can hold this suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or the appointment of counsel."" But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Saturday that the suspect should not be held as an enemy combatant. ""I am not aware of any evidence so far that the Boston suspect is part of any organized group, let alone al Qaeda, the Taliban, or one of their affiliates -- the only organizations whose members are subject to detention under the Authorization for Use of Military Force, as it has been consistently interpreted by all three branches of our government,"" he said. ""In the absence of such evidence I know of no legal basis for his detention as an enemy combatant. To hold the suspect as an enemy combatant under these circumstances would be contrary to our laws and may even jeopardize our efforts to prosecute him for his crimes."" Alan Dershowitz, a prominent defense attorney and Harvard law professor, scoffed at the Republican senators' statement. ""Impossible. There's no way an American citizen committing a domestic crime in the city of Boston could be tried as an enemy combatant,"" he told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""It could never happen. And that shows absolute ignorance of the law."" Dershowitz also said statements made by police in Boston seems to contradict the government's reasons for invoking the public safety exception. ""The police have said there's no public safety issue; it's solved, it's over,"" Dershowitz said. ""There are no further threats. But the FBI is saying there's enough further threats to justify an exception."" Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said the federal government may have known about international threats about which state officials were not aware. ""You would have to know the internals of what they have before you can assess whether there is a sensible invocation or not,"" Giuliani said. If the government had prior knowledge of Tsarnaev's activities, it hasn't disclosed it. It did say that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been on the FBI's radar in the past. FBI agents interviewed Tamerlan two years ago and also looked at his travel history, checked databases for derogatory information and searched for Web postings. The agency found no connection with terror groups, an FBI official told CNN. Two key Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee -- Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, the panel's chairman; and Rep. Peter King of New York -- will press the Obama administration for details about the FBI's questioning of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to a GOP congressional source. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was not a U.S. citizen, traveled to Sheremetyevo, Russia, in January 2012, according to travel records provided by a U.S. official. He returned six months later. Federal or state trial? Dershowitz said there are many arguments that can be made to try the case in state court. It may be hard for a prosecutor to prove which crimes were committed by Tsarnaev or his older brother, Dershowitz said. ""If he says my intent was to please my brother, they could raise the question of federal jurisdiction,"" Dershowitz said. This fight over federal or state jurisdiction could mean life or death. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. There's another big question: The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 requires temporary military custody of certain terrorist suspects, but Dzhokar Tsarnaev is a U.S. citizen, and the act doesn't apply to Americans. What is the reaction in the suspects' homeland? Tsarnaev's family lives in the Russian republic of Dagestan, which is next to the suspects' homeland of Chechnya, located in the North Caucasus region of southern Russia. Russia's investigative committee in Dagestan said it will not engage with the Tsarnaev family unless there is ""an order from above"" to do so, spokesman Rasul Temerbekov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday. A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday that Russia wants to get official information from the United States about the bombing suspects, and he wants there to be contact between investigators in both countries. CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","NEW: Federal Public Defender Office in Boston to represent Dzhokar Tsarnaev after charges are filed .

"(Mental Floss) -- As the economy continues to look grim, the word ""bankruptcy"" is on the tips of more and more tongues. While being unable to pay one's creditors is never a good situation for a company or an individual, it may not be the financial kiss of death that you might think. (Just ask Donald Trump, whose casinos have gone bankrupt twice.) Abraham Lincoln was just one of several U.S. presidents who declared bankruptcy during their lifetimes. A number of successful people have found themselves overextended and ended up filing for bankruptcy, only to successfully stick it out and find firmer financial footing again. Here are a few famous names who knew what it's like to be strapped for cash: . 1. Abraham Lincoln . His face may now appear on the penny, but at one time, Lincoln didn't have a single cent to spare. Lincoln tried many occupations as a young man, including buying a general store in New Salem, Illinois, in 1832. While he may have been terrific at splitting rails, winning debates, and wearing stovepipe hats, Honest Abe wasn't much of a shopkeeper. Lincoln and his partner started buying out other stores' inventories on credit, but their own sales were dismal.  Mental Floss: How ex-presidents make ends meet . As the store's debts mounted, Lincoln sold his share, but when his partner died, the future President became liable for $1,000 in back payments. Lincoln didn't have modern bankruptcy laws to protect him, so when his creditors took him to court, he lost his two remaining assets: a horse and some surveying gear. That wasn't enough to foot his bill, though, and Lincoln continued paying off his debts until well into the 1840s. Lincoln's not alone in the annals of bankrupt commanders-in-chief, though. Ulysses S. Grant went bankrupt after leaving office when a partner in an investment-banking venture swindled him. Thomas Jefferson filed for bankruptcy several times, including after leaving office, possibly because he threw around a lot of cash on food and wine. William McKinley went bankrupt while serving as Ohio's governor in 1893; he was $130,000 in the red before eventually straightening out with the help of friends. He won the White House just three years later. iReport.com: What are you doing to keep your job? 2. Henry Ford . Speculation abounds about the future of the Big Three motor companies, leading some observers to wonder what Henry Ford would think of this financial peril. Ford actually couldn't be too judgmental, though, because he was no stranger to debt himself. In 1899 the young mechanic and engineer started the Detroit Automobile Company with the backing of three prominent politicians. Ford hadn't quite mastered the innovation and production techniques that would eventually make him rich, though. Over the next two years, Ford proved to be too much of a perfectionist, and his plant only produced 20 cars as he painstakingly tinkered with designs. The enterprise went bankrupt in 1901 and reorganized into the Henry Ford Company later that year. Ford eventually left that group and finally got things right in 1903, when he founded the Ford Motor Company. Things didn't go so badly for the Henry Ford Company after he left, either; it changed its name into one you might find a bit more recognizable: the Cadillac Automobile Company. Ford wasn't the only auto magnate who knew how bankruptcy felt, though. General Motors founder William Crapo Durant took a massive hit during the Great Depression that saw his fortune fall from $120 million to bankruptcy. He spent his last few years running a bowling alley in Flint, Michigan. 3. Walt Disney . His name may be a stalwart brand today, but early in his career, Disney was just a struggling filmmaker with too many bills. In 1922 he started his first film company with a partner in Kansas City, Kansas. The two men bought a used camera and made short advertising films and cartoons under the studio name Laugh-O-Gram. Disney even signed a deal with a New York company to distribute the films he was producing. That arrangement didn't work out so well, though, as the distributor cheated Disney's studio. Without the distributor's cash, Disney couldn't cover his overhead, and his studio went bankrupt in 1923. He then left Kansas City for Hollywood, and after a series of increasingly successful creations, Disney debuted a new character named Mickey Mouse in 1928. Mental Floss: The secrets behind your favorite toys . 4. Milton Hershey . Milton Hershey always knew he could make candy, but running a successful business seemed just out of his reach. Although he never had a formal education, Hershey spent four years apprenticing in a candy shop before striking out on his own in Philadelphia in 1876. Six years later, his shop went under, as did a subsequent attempt to peddle sweets in New York City. Hershey then returned home to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he pioneered the use of fresh milk in caramel productions and founded the successful Lancaster Caramel Company. In 1900 he sold the caramel company for $1 million so he could focus on perfecting a milk chocolate formula. Once he finally nailed the recipe down, he was too rich (and too flush with delicious chocolate) for anyone to remember the flops of his early candy ventures. 5. Burt Reynolds . Burt Reynolds was one of Hollywood's biggest stars of the 1970s. Unfortunately, though, he spent money like his career would never hit a downswing. He owned mansions on both coasts, a helicopter, and a lavish Florida ranch. Gradually, his financial situation got grimmer as he made boneheaded career choices and weathered a pricey divorce from Loni Anderson. By 1996, the Bandit owed $10 million to his creditors, and the royalties from ""Cop and a Half"" just weren't flowing in quickly enough. Reynolds declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, from which he emerged in 1998. Not only did he not have to sell his trademark mustache at auction to pay his bills, Reynolds even got to keep his Florida estate, Valhalla. This homestead exemption raised the ire of some observers who didn't think hanging on to a $2.5 million mansion while writing off $8 million in debt was quite in the spirit of bankruptcy laws' provisions about keeping one's home. In fact, when the Senate passed measures tightening these loopholes in 2001, Reynolds' keeping his ranch was one of the examples they used to decry bankruptcy proceedings as going too easy on the wealthy. ""There is no greater bankruptcy abuse than this,"" said Wisconsin Senator Herb Kohl. 6. H.J. Heinz . When Heinz was just 25 years old, he and two partners began a company that made horseradish. As the legend goes, the spicy root was the first of Heinz's famed 57 varieties, but it wasn't as lucrative as he'd hoped. A business panic in 1875 bankrupted his enterprise, but Heinz's passion for condiments remained strong. The very next year, Heinz got together with his brother and a cousin to start a new company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The reorganized group started making ketchup, and the business took off. Last year the H.J. Heinz Company had over $10 billion in revenue. 7. P.T. Barnum . Famous showman P.T. Barnum was always quick with a quip, but he wasn't so snappy about paying back his loans. Although he was successful showing off oddities in New York and around the globe, Barnum had a habit of borrowing cash from anyone who would open their wallet for him.   Mental Floss: 12 oddball museums preserving our history . He'd use these funds to buy real estate, particularly around Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he was trying to foster industrial development. Unfortunately for Barnum, he went too far with borrowed cash, and in 1855, things bottomed out. Barnum was bankrupt and owed his creditors nearly half a million dollars. Barnum didn't give up, though, and he slowly worked himself out of debt over the next five years. The showman gave lectures around England about showmanship and making money, and he regained control of his main attraction, The American Museum in New York City, in 1860. In 1871, just a few months shy of his 61st birthday, Barnum entered the circus business with Barnum's Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan, and Circus, which raked in over $400,000 in its first year.

"(CNN) -- The 13-year-old boy told them he knew wrestling on TV was fake, sheriff's officials in a New Orleans suburb said. But, according to authorities in Jefferson Parish, his account of practicing ""WWE""-style wrestling moves by punching, jumping on and slamming his 5-year-old half-sister to the bed was all too real, and fatal. Viloude Louis, 5, of Terrytown, was found unresponsive on a bathroom floor Sunday. She was taken to a hospital, where she was declared dead. The boy, whose name was not released by authorities because of his age, has been accused of second-degree murder; he remained in Rivarde Juvenile Detention Center on Wednesday. He ""was smiling and appeared as though he took great pride in what he was doing,"" sheriff's Col. John Fortunato told CNN on Wednesday. ""He showed no remorse while he was being interviewed in the presence of his mother."" The half-siblings' mother left them at home when she went to the store Sunday, authorities said in a statement. The juvenile suspect initially said he found Viloude lying in the bathroom, complaining of a stomachache, authorities said. The boy said he took her downstairs, where she lay down on a sofa. He said he called 911 when he noticed she was not breathing, authorities said. The mother returned home while emergency officials were on the scene. An external examination of the little girl by the coroner's office noted no obvious signs of trauma or major injuries, and her death was listed as unclassified. But a follow-up interview with the teen boy and his mother Monday brought a different account of what allegedly occurred while he was babysitting. The 13-year-old, who is 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 100 pounds, told an investigator about punching his half-sister in the stomach several times and slamming her on the bed, authorities said. The youth said he was practicing ""WWE""-style moves on the 5-year-old. ""Additionally, he jumped on the victim and struck her with his elbow several times like the wrestlers do on television,"" the sheriff's office statement said. The boy said the victim complained that she was hurting, ""but he continued to slam, punch and elbow her for an additional two or three minutes, stopping when his mother called him on the phone to check on he and the victim."" The boy smiled and appeared to enjoy talking about the wrestling moves, authorities said. An autopsy showed the girl's injuries included severe blunt force trauma to the body, multiple internal injuries, including broken ribs, lacerations to the liver, and internal bleeding. The Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office declined to provide further information or comment, noting that the suspect is a minor. WWE, the Connecticut-based World Wrestling Entertainment, in a statement Wednesday called the girl's death a tragedy. It said authorities determined Viloude's death was ""not an accidental death due to a wrestling move. ""The facts of this case clearly point to a lack of parental supervision. ... It is illogical to conclude that the repeated, brutal and ultimately fatal beating of a 5-year-old little girl by a teenager could be confused with imitation of WWE action seen on TV. "" The mother will not face charges, according to Fortunato. CNN's Joe Sutton and Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.","Boy is accused of second-degree murder in half-sister's death .

"(Parenting.com) -- Timber Branagan preferred the orange light. No wait, the green light. Oh, and the red too. ""I loved all of them!"" the 6-year-old says enthusiastically. Choosing a custom color for her hospital room was one of Timber's favorite perks at Nemours Children's Hospital, the new 60-acre health campus outside Orlando. Her mom, Andrea, adds that her daughter preferred the purple light at night. Timber also made full use of the 10,000-square-foot garden terrace on the fourth floor. She was admitted with a mystery illness, having suffered through six weeks of debilitating headaches that left her sleeping 18 hours a day. By day three of her six-day stay at Nemours, the physicians had it figured out: encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. By day four, she was racing her older brother around the terrace's 40-year-old, 6,000-pound live oak. Parenting.com: 8 times you should absolutely call your doctor . Set amidst a wooded expanse of central Florida, with theme park roller coasters peppering the horizon, Nemours Children's Hospital is arguably the new high water mark for pediatric care in the United States. It's a hospital that believes nature -- and its healing properties -- is as valuable as any IV or pill. ""Hospital in a garden"" is how chief medical officer Dr. Lane Donnelly describes Nemours, which opened October 22, 2012. It's a concept underscored by the many nature-centric touches. The floor-to-above-ceiling windows flood the rooms and public spaces with natural light, not dull fluorescence. The two rooftop terraces feature obstacle courses and walking paths. The one-acre discovery garden is built around the senses: Fragrant flowers bloom in the section dedicated to smell; a few steps away, the ears are engaged by xylophone benches and percussive art. It's all part of a budding trend in medical care, one that believes nature can speed up the healing process, particularly with children, where the stress of hospital stays can be much greater. (Nemours eliminates stress wherever it can. Donnelly points out that the hospital room ceilings are matte, not metallic or glossy like most medical facilities. ""When the children are in bed, they don't like to look at themselves attached to tubes and machines,"" he notes.) Parenting.com: 15 kid and toddler superfoods . This ""it's what's outside that counts"" philosophy first gained attention in 1984 with Robert Ulrich's pioneering ""window view"" study. Surgery patients at a Pennsylvania hospital were assigned to two types of rooms: One had a window facing a brick wall; the other faced a tree-filled landscape. The study found that the patients with the verdant view healed a day faster, needed less pain medication, and had fewer postsurgical complications. More recently, a 2005 study conducted at a Pittsburgh hospital focused on the effect sunlight has on patients recovering from surgery. Those who had bright, naturally lit rooms experienced less stress, less pain, and required less medication than those in dimly lit rooms. Nemours isn't the only new children's hospital prescribing sunshine and serenity. The Ann and Robert Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago recently launched a study to understand the effect healing spaces have on kids. The study's laboratory is the hospital's own Crown Sky Garden, a 5,000-square-foot respite 11 floors above Chicago Avenue. It's a soaring greenhouse flanked by skyscrapers, and outfitted with bamboo trees, carved wooden benches and an interactive light wall. Parenting.com: Must know winter safety tips . ""The day after Lurie Children's opened, I visited the Crown Sky Garden at about 7 o'clock in the evening,"" says Bruce Komiske, chief of new hospital design and construction. ""I saw a family seated on the wooden benches near the windows -- a patient, a mother, and a father huddled around a jigsaw puzzle and their dinner. It looked just like a beautiful family setting in a park."" But healing spaces are not standard issue at modern hospitals. In fact, some are in danger of being eliminated. Earlier this year, a movement began to save the beloved Prouty Garden at Boston Children's Hospital, which may become a casualty of the facility's expansion. A petition was created on Change.org; there are currently more than 4,200 signatures. ""The relief it gives to our long-term patients is a godsend,"" writes one supporter, a 22-year volunteer at the hospital. ""I have witnessed the comfort and solace it has given so many families."" ""All the amenities at Nemours are as much for the parents as they are the children,"" says Donnelly as a yellow tang fish swims past his head. The saltwater tank on the ground floor is provided and maintained by SeaWorld. (Being near Orlando has its perks.) Last week, the young patients staying at Nemours woke up to a curious sight: Elves dangling outside their windows. The window washing crew donned pointed hats, green tunics, and red and green argyle socks as they worked their squeegees. Sure, they brought a dose of holiday cheer, but more importantly, they're making sure the sun gets in. Parenting.com: Take a photo tour of the hospital .

"London (CNN) -- Royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child that will be heir to the British throne. Here's what you need to know and the latest developments: . • Could the world's media be camped outside the wrong hospital? Britain's Telegraph newspaper reports that a contingency plan is in place for Catherine to give birth at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, if she goes into labor while staying at her parents' home in Berkshire, and its swift progress means the journey back to London is impractical. • The Duchess of Cambridge is expected, however, to give birth at the private Lindo wing of St. Mary's Hospital, next to Paddington Station in London. It's where William was born. Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton, is likely to be on hand at the hospital. Why are some babies overdue? • There's been plenty of speculation about the baby's name -- and betting is going strong. The famous Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London, which takes in and re-homes lost and unwanted pets, has gone a step further and named a litter of kittens after the bookies' favorites: Alexandra, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Victoria, Grace, James and George. • Queen Elizabeth II is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world. On a visit to northern England Wednesday, she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great-grandchild to be a boy or a girl. The queen replied: ""I don't think I mind. I would very much like it to arrive. I'm going on holiday."" • The Duchess of Cambridge is now overdue. A royal source tells CNN that her due date was July 13. She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July, but did not announce the date. • Prince Charles' wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, said Monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon. ""We're all waiting at the end of a telephone,"" she said, in an exchange filmed by ITV. ""I hope by the end of the week, he or she will be there."" • The baby will have the title His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess (the baby's name) of Cambridge, St. James's Palace said this month. However, it could be as long as 10 days before the baby's name is announced. • Anyone born in Britain on the same day as William and Catherine's baby will receive a special coin from the Royal Mint: a silver penny, dated 2013, that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl. • The first indication that the royal baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources tell CNN. The next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth. It will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace. There, the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce William's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see. • The first to know about the royal baby will be Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister David Cameron and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations, along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families. If the baby arrives in the middle of the night, it's unlikely the queen will be awoken, so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning. • Celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park (41 rounds) and the Honorable Artillery Company at the Tower of London (62 rounds) after the baby is born. • William and Catherine did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand, royal sources say. There has been speculation it is a girl, however, especially after a member of the public said in March that the duchess almost uttered ""daughter"" while at a public event in Grimsby. The woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied, ""Thank you, I will take that for my d--"" but then stopped herself. • The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William, regardless of gender. A rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture, which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons. It means that if the next royal baby is a girl, she will eventually become queen; previously, a younger male sibling would have taken precedence. • The queen's cousin, Margaret Rhodes, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour she hoped the child would have a normal childhood. ""I imagine and hope that its early life, until it's at least in its teens, will be just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's life,"" she said. • It's not known where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth. William is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the Ministry of Defence, royal sources say. He will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot. • The revelation that Catherine was pregnant came after she was admitted to a London hospital in December for acute morning sickness.","A contingency plan is in place for Catherine to give birth near her parents' home, media report .

"(CNN) -- It's not every day you read about one top-level executive asking another where his balls are. But in the end, former Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz lived up to her reputation for ""salty language"" and candid management style. Since Bartz's very public departure from Yahoo last week, her penchant for blunt, profane language has become recurring themes in discussions of her career, driving conversation about what women can and can't be in the workplace. ""It stands out because it's not expected,"" said Deborah Tannen, a linguistics professor at Georgetown University and author of ""You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation."" ""We always take notice of what's unexpected and women are still not expected to curse, so when they do, it's noticed more."" Bartz got the ball rolling when she called the board members that fired her a bunch of ""doofuses"" who ""f----- me over"" in her first public comments after the now infamous firing-by-phone. Those statements came two days after Yahoo chairman Roy Bostock called her on her cell phone last Tuesday to deliver the news. In response, she sent an e-mail to Yahoo's 14,000 colleagues telling them ""I've just been fired over the phone by Yahoo's chairman of the board"" and wishing them the best. Since then, tales of her ""characteristically salty language"" and perceived abrasiveness have peppered the post-mortems on her two-year tenure, which many seem to agree ended due to her failure to boost revenue and lack of long-term vision. Even The Wall Street Journal published an amusing compilation of ""Carol Bartz's Best Quotes,"" a testament to how her ""crude honesty"" and ""blue language"" became part of her brand. ""What do I look for when hiring? Well, let's get past the assumption that they can do the job. There has to be a no-a------ rule,"" she said in a 2010 interview with Esquire titled, ""Hi, I'm Carol Bartz... Are You an A------?"" The attention devoted to Bartz's candor, profane or otherwise, reflects the double-bind faced by women in the business world, especially those in high positions, Tannen said. ""If women talk in ways expected of them or project a feminine demeanor, it's seen as weak. But if they talk in ways associated with men or bosses, then they're seen as too aggressive,"" she said. ""Whatever they do violates one or the other expectation, either you're not talking as you should as a woman or as boss."" Perhaps unsurprisingly, if you believe women are treated differently than men, Tannen and others think that a dirty-mouthed man would not receive as much attention for his blue language as Bartz has. ""For people to call it 'salty language' shows how we're uncomfortable talking about women who swear. I don't think anyone would describe a rapper's language as being salty,"" said former Nickelodeon executive Anne Kreamer, whose book, ""It's Always Personal: Emotions in the New Workplace,"" came out this year. The fact that Bartz was known for swearing, crying and confrontations also reflects the tight-lipped, buttoned-up culture pervading corporate America, Kreamer said. In researching her book, ""Emotions in the Workplace,"" Kreamer said she found that 60% of employees reported never seeing their bosses get angry or display any kind of unpleasant emotion. ""People are barely keeping it together, and that's why this becomes a conversation point because everyone wants to be able to publicly flip off the boss one way or another. But you swallow it because you don't want to lose your job,"" she said. Not everyone considers swearing in the workplace appropriate, said Charles Conine, who runs Consilium, an employee and labor relations consulting service. But standards vary depending on whether the workplace is a corporate office in Silicon Valley or a battlefield in Afghanistan. Yahoo isn't known for its culture of confrontation, which could be why Bartz's actions -- while at Yahoo and in her public flipping-off of its board -- still has power to shock the public, Kreamer said. ""We go through these Kabuki-like dances of ways to save face in corporate America,"" Kreamer said. ""The way she simply said, 'I've been fired' was brilliantly refreshing. She said it as blunt as she did because she was pissed off, and we rarely see that.""","Profanity, candor are trademarks of Carol Bartz's management style at Yahoo .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad's latest attempt to swim across the Straits of Florida ended Tuesday morning after severe jellyfish stings and a lightning storm put her off course, her team said. She had been in the water for 60 hours and was about halfway through her swim from Cuba to Florida. Nyad was stung by jellyfish overnight, and a major lightning storm put anyone in the water in extreme danger, said Mark Sollinger, Nyad's operations chief. He said the 62-year-old exhausted swimmer was pulled out as the dangers mounted. ""With all the threats continuing, Diana decided that it was not a risk that we wanted to take,"" Sollinger said. Nyad's lips and face are swollen, but she is holding up ""as well as someone who just spent 63 hours"" performing a ""monumental and extremely dangerous"" feat, Sollinger told CNN's ""Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien."" Sollinger described her achievement as ""huge,"" despite having to stop before she reached Florida. ""It's a cross between being down, being so tired because everyone wanted this so much, and a huge sense of accomplishment,"" he said. ""Nobody in the world would even attempt this, but we did."" Nyad was making her fourth attempt to swim across the Straits of Florida. The full distance from Havana, Cuba, to Key West, Florida, is 103 miles. On Saturday night, her first night in the water, Nyad was stung by jellyfish on her lips, forehead, hands and neck, her blog said. The next night, a sudden squall blew her off course. ""There is lots of lightning out there and the storm is blowing right on top of Diana,"" a blog post stated early Monday, adding that the swimmer was safe and ""feeling strong."" But Nyad and her crew were treated to a grand display of dolphins Monday evening. Girl, 14, crosses Lake Ontario . Nyad's first attempt to cross the Straits of Florida was in 1978, when rough seas left her battered, delirious and less than halfway toward her goal. She tried again twice last year, but her efforts ended after an 11-hour asthma attack and jellyfish stings. Nyad insisted Friday she was ready to try it again. ""I'm feeling tremendous inner pressure that this has got to be it, this has got to be the last time,"" she said. Nyad was swimming without a shark cage, relying on electronic shark repellent and a team of divers to keep the predators away. In the 1970s, she won multiple swimming marathons and was one of the first women to swim around the island of Manhattan. She holds the world's record for longest ocean swim -- 102.5 miles from Bimini in the Bahamas to Jupiter, Florida. Nyad said she was 8 years old when she first dreamed about swimming across the Straits of Florida. At the time, she was in Cuba on a trip from her home in Florida in the 1950s, before Fidel Castro led a Communist takeover in Cuba and the country's relations with the United States soured. ""I used to stand on the beach and I said to my mother, 'I wonder if anybody could swim over there,'"" Nyad recalled saying while pointing to the Keys. In her 60s, she says, she still feels ""vital (and) powerful"" -- and definitely ""not old."" A successful swim ideally will inspire people her age and older not to let their age hinder them, Nyad said. ""When I walk up on that shore in Florida, I want millions of those AARP sisters and brothers to look at me and say, 'I'm going to go write that novel I thought it was too late to do. I'm going to go work in Africa on that farm that those people need help at. I'm going to adopt a child. It's not too late, I can still live my dreams,' "" she had said.

"(CNN) -- Eight and a half years after his third wife was found dead in a bathtub, the murder trial of former Chicago-area police officer Drew Peterson is set to begin in earnest with opening statements Tuesday. The 58-year-old Peterson is accused in the 2004 death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, in a trial that has been postponed for two years. He also remains under investigation in the October 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. A jury of seven men and five women, chosen over two days last week, will weigh Drew Peterson's fate during a trial in Joliet, Illinois, that is expected to last about a month, according to his lawyer Joel Brodsky. After the jury selection was finished Tuesday, Will County, Illinois, State's Attorney James Glasgow told reporters, ""We're ready to go... We're anxious to get to trial, put the evidence before the jury and arrive at a verdict."" Brodsky, meanwhile, said he planned to use his opening statement to ""tell the story of Drew Peterson from beginning to end ... and show the state's theory is implausible at best."" Inside Drew Peterson's tangled love life . Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he met then 17-year-old Stacy Kales (who later became Stacy Peterson), and those two began having an affair. Savio and Peterson filed for divorce from each other that October, and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years. Boilingbrook, Illinois, police records indicate officers were called to Savio's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004. Drew Peterson had Savio arrested twice for domestic violence, though she was found not guilty in both cases. A judge in March 2002 granted Savio a protection order from her ex-husband, prohibiting him from being near her, entering her home and taking out their children except for two brief weekly visits. (Their two sons later spent every other weekend with their father, per the divorce settlement.) Savio had claimed that, months later, Peterson held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her inside her home. In October 2003, three months after giving birth to what was Peterson's fifth child, the then-19-year-old Stacy Kales and 49-year-old Drew Peterson married. The Will County prosecutor alleged that, later that year, Peterson tried to pay someone $25,000 to kill Savio. And her sister Sue Doman told ABC News years later that Savio had called her saying she feared ""he was going to kill her, and it was going to look like an accident."" In Session blog: Catch up on the Peterson case in 3 minutes . Drew Peterson picked up his two sons from Savio's home on February 27, 2004, spending the next two days with them. Prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on February 29 and killed her; she was found naked and dead in her dry tub the next day. At the time of her death, a court was mulling how their marital assets would be divided and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. Police initially treated the scene as an accident, although the Illinois State Police was later brought in to investigate. On March 20, Dr. Bryan Mitchell from the Will County coroner's office said in an autopsy report that the cause of Savio's death was drowning, her hair was soaked in blood from a cut on her scalp, and she had small bruises on her body. A six-person coroner's jury ruled her death an accident in May 2004, after an Illinois State Police officer told them investigators had no reason to suspect homicide and that the cut on her head was caused by a fall. This trooper hadn't gone to the death scene or to the autopsy, nor had he interviewed Peterson. Savio's family also testified in that coroner's jury hearing that Savio feared her ex-husband, who stood to benefit financially from her death. In October 2007 Stacy Peterson contacted a local attorney and told him she wanted to discuss filing for divorce. Later that month, after divulging her intentions to her husband, she disappeared. Drew Peterson said she abandoned her two children, ages 4 and 2, and ran off with another man. The next month, state police labeled Drew Peterson a suspect in his fourth wife's disappearance, though neither he nor anyone else has been charged in that case. Stacy Peterson has never been found. 2009: Peterson calls a radio talk show . The investigation into Stacy Peterson's disappearance brought renewed interest in Savio's death. Authorities exhumed Savio's body, further tests were conducted, and her death was later ruled a ""homicide staged to look like an accident."" In May 2009, months after a judge admitted authorities had an ""extensive"" collection of secretly recorded conversations with Peterson, Drew Peterson was indicted and arrested on murder charges in connection with Savio's death. He was ordered held on $20 million bond. Brodsky, his lawyer, said then in a written statement that prosecutors would not be able to prove their case because ""he didn't do it."" ""There is no evidence that links Drew Peterson to the death of Kathleen Savio or anyone else for that matter,"" Brodsky said. ""Drew did not harm Kathleen; he has said so from Day 1. We're obviously disappointed a grand jury indicted him. But an indictment does not mean guilt."" Brodsky told CNN he believes the case has always been about circumstantial evidence and that he will bring a pathologist to trial who will say Savio died from an accidental drowning. ""I think the jury's going to see that, in fact, this always has been an accidental death and still is an accidental death,"" Brodsky . Martin Glink, an attorney for the Savio family, said relatives were glad the grand jury felt there was enough evidence to charge Peterson. ""We're very happy that the wheels of justice have continued to move, and they are pointing in his direction,"" Glink told CNN affiliate WLS. 2010: Read Peterson's letter to the media . Peterson's trial had been set to start in July 2010, but was delayed. This past April, an Illinois appellate court ruled that prosecutors may use potentially incriminating statements made by Savio and Drew Peterson's still-missing-wife Stacy against him, a key development in the case. The ruling overturned an earlier judge's decision that forbid prosecutors from using eight statements made by Savio before her death and by Stacy Peterson before her disappearance. The defense had argued that using the statements would violate Drew Peterson's right to confront the witnesses against him.

"New York (CNN) -- A New Jersey man was indicted Thursday for allegedly sexually abusing a woman who was asleep on an airplane, the U.S. District Attorney's Office said. Bawer Aksal was detained on August 21 upon his arrival in Newark, New Jersey. According to the indictment, he was seated next to a woman in a window seat on a United Airlines flight from Phoenix to Newark. ""While the plane was in the air, the woman -- who did not know Aksal -- fell asleep with a jacket across her legs. She awoke to find Aksal's hands inside her shirt and shorts as he asked her to kiss him,"" according to a news release from the District Attorney's Office in New Jersey. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over all sexual abuse cases that occur on American airplane flights, as such events are outside the jurisdiction of any state. If convicted, Aksal faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine, the news release said. On Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo set bail at $100,000 for Aksal, ""who remains detained,"" according to Matthew Reilly of the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. Calls to Aksal's criminal defense lawyer, Robert J. Degroot, were not immediately returned. An additional hearing will not be scheduled until Aksal settles his bail, Reilly said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court building is getting a face-lift to its famous facade, seven years after a chunk of marble fell 100 feet onto the stairs leading to the entrance, where it broke into pieces. Court officials announced Wednesday work will begin next week to repair and preserve the front exterior, which is decorated with artistic friezes, ornate molding, and the words ""Equal Justice Under Law."" The project will take 21 months. No estimate of the cost was released. Access to the building will not be affected. Visible protective netting has been in place since the November 2005 incident, when either one or two sections of marble totaling about 80 pounds fell onto the plaza below fell onto the plaza below. They were part of the dentil molding lining the west pediment, above the Robert Aitken sculpture of ""Liberty Enthroned."" The episode occurred about 9:30 a.m., about 30 minutes before oral arguments were to begin. At the time, about three dozen people were lined up outside the building, 15 feet from where the shattered white marble -- some about 12 inches by 10 inches in size -- fell. One of the witnesses, Ed Fisher, said the fall was preceded by ""a big cracking sound."" Other visitors, including some schoolchildren, picked up bits of marble that had trickled down the exterior steps, saving them as souvenirs. Former justice announces education project . The dislodged marble fell from above a figure called Authority, one of three central figures in the sculpture, along with Liberty and Order. The building had been undergoing an extensive interior rehabilitation at the time, but court officers had no official explanation for what caused the falling marble. The court said that after an untold number of surveys, a stone conservation consultant has recommended work, including ""cleaning, pointing, bird deterrent removal, stone consolidation to prevent further deterioration, and necessary repairs.""

"(CNN) -- The J.K. Rowling/Robert Galbraith tale is a great and irresistible publishing story -- but it's only the second-best I've ever heard. You may have read about Rowling and Galbraith last week. Rowling, whose Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies, is the most successful author in the world. Galbraith, whose new detective novel ""The Cuckoo's Calling"" had been selling dismally, doesn't exist. Rowling is Galbraith. Fast facts: J.K. Rowling . She wrote and published ""The Cuckoo's Calling"" under Galbraith's name, to see what would happen if readers and critics didn't know she was the author. The book received glowing reviews, but few readers purchased a copy. Then, last weekend, the secret was revealed, and ""The Cuckoo's Calling"" zoomed to No. 1 best-seller status. Massive reprintings were ordered. Rowling, in a statement, said, ""It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation, and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name."" Yet top-echelon executives at Rowling's publisher knew all along that she was Robert Galbraith -- that she had written the book. And they presumably knew that, once the word got out, they would have an enormous and profitable blockbuster on their hands. But what if Robert Galbraith really had been Robert Galbraith? What if an unknown author by that name had tried to sell ""The Cuckoo's Calling"" to a publisher? Best-selling female authors with male monikers . As good as the book is, would a publisher have taken a chance on it? Before you answer ""Of course,"" consider the case of Chuck Ross -- the protagonist of the most instructive, the most damning, and the most hilarious true story about publishing there ever has been. I interviewed him and reported on his story almost 35 years ago. Ross, in the 1970s, was a young would-be author who was trying with no success to get his first novel published. He was receiving nothing but rejection slips. He wondered whether his writing really was that unappealing, or if publishers were simply turning him down because he was an unknown. So he decided upon a clever, if highly unconventional, way to find out. In those pre-personal-computer days, he sat down at a typewriter and copied every single word of the novel ""Steps,"" by Jerzy Kosinski. ""Steps"" had won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1969, had received superlative reviews and was a big best-seller. Once Ross had finished typing up the manuscript, he made sure not to put a title on it. He did put a byline on it: his own. He made copies, and he mailed them off. The recipients were 14 major publishing houses. Four of those houses had published books by Kosinski. One of them had published ""Steps."" The manuscript was turned down by all 14 houses. None realized that it was rejecting ""Steps."" Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which had published Kosinski's ""Being There,"" wrote to Ross: . ""While your prose style is very lucid, the content of the book didn't inspire the level of enthusiasm here that a publisher should have for any book on their list in order to do well by it."" Houghton Mifflin, which had published three of Kosinski's books, wrote Ross to say that it did not wish to publish what Ross had sent. Not that the editors thought he was a bad writer -- they said they admired his style: ""Jerzy Kosinski comes to mind as a point of comparison when reading the stark, chilly, episodic incidents you have set down."" But, they said in their rejection letter, what Ross had sent them ""doesn't add up to a satisfactory whole. It has some very impressive moments, but gives the impression of sketchiness and incompleteness."" They wrote that they would be happy to consider future efforts by him, but that this one just didn't work. Random House, which had published ""Steps,"" sent a form letter rejecting the retyped ""Steps."" Ross thought that maybe the problem was that he was submitting his novel -- that is, Kosinski's novel -- without the assistance of a literary agent. So he sent the manuscript to 13 top agents, asking if they would represent it. Not one of them was interested. Some excerpts from the agents' rejection letters: . ""I'm afraid the novel's episodic nature and the lack of strong characterization would not allow this book to compete in a very tough fiction market."" And: . ""From the section I read of your untitled novel, it seems too fragmented and dreamlike to be a good commercial bet."" And: . ""Thanks for having sent me your untitled novel. You write clearly and well, but I felt that the novel jumped around so much that it did not hold interest, and I would not be the right agent for it."" When Ross went public with what he had done, he expected the publishers and agents to be a little embarrassed that they had turned down a National Book Award-winning novel. But, he told me when I interviewed him at the time, ""I guess not. I went to the American Booksellers Association convention to talk to the publishers about what I did. They all thought that it was very amusing or silly. They agreed that it probably could happen again tomorrow. But the attitude was, 'So what?'"" As lovely as the J.K. Rowling/Robert Galbraith saga is, what would have made it even better, and turned it into more of a cliffhanger, is if Rowling had gone the Chuck Ross route: . If she had, without revealing her identity, sent ""The Cuckoo's Calling"" to publishers cold -- if she had submitted it and let them think that it really was by a novice named Robert Galbraith. Would any of them have snapped it up? It may be a terrific book -- but so was ""Steps."" And without Kosinski's name on the manuscript, ""Steps"" couldn't find a publisher. Or an agent. Even though it had already won the National Book Award. What a business. It's enough to drive even Harry Potter to drink. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: J.K. Rowling used pseudonym to publish book that didn't sell, but critics liked .
She was outed as author, sales of the book soared .
Greene: If publisher hadn't known it was Rowling, it would have been a more telling tale .
He says once an unknown author retyped a famous novel; no publisher would take it ."
"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old boy and his 13-year-old girlfriend who ran away together last month from Michigan were found safe Sunday in Chicago. An anonymous caller rang the Chicago police after spotting the teens. The pair was found in a parked Ford SUV on the north side of Chicago, said police spokesman John Mirabelli. The car was next to a gas station and out of gas. The teens' parents have been notified and are en route to pick them up, Mirabelli said. Braxton Wood, 14, and his girlfriend, Jayden Thomas, 13, were believed to have driven off August 26 in Wood's parents' 2005 black Ford Explorer with about $80 in cash. Until Sunday, no one in Isabella County, located about 160 miles northwest of Detroit, had heard from them. Police considered the teens runaways (they didn't issue an Amber Alert) and said there was no reason to believe they faced imminent danger. Before they were found, Braxton's mother, Sarah Kiley, told HLN's Kyra Phillips she thought they had a pretty healthy relationship, though it had been on-again, off-again recently. ""They felt like they were very much in love. And that's intense for 13- and 14-year-olds. But I felt like it was a positive (relationship),"" Kiley said Friday on HLN's Raising America. She pleaded then for both teens to come home. ""It's been too long. We know they have to be scared. They're young. They don't have any resources to make it on their own. And if they're scared to come home, please don't be. We'll support them in whatever they need. We just need them home. Life can't go on without them here.""

"(CNN) -- All eyes at the Group of 20 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, will be on Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama, two men who are barely on speaking terms. Undoubtedly there will be drama. Putin brought his pet Labrador, Koni, to his first meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has a well-known fear of dogs, to intimidate her. Given Putin's track record, one could be forgiven for thinking that Edward Snowden might make an appearance in the Russian delegation. The true cost of the U.S.-Russian dispute will only become apparent in a few months. As the leaders focus on Syria, the purpose of the summit -- managing the global economy -- will get short shrift. As concern grows about economic troubles in emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil, we are unlikely to see a coordinated response from St. Petersburg. Official agenda items such as energy subsidies and food security will be completely overshadowed. The G20 leaders' summit was created in 2008 after the fall of Lehman Brothers as the world economy stood on the brink of collapse. The West's leaders recognized they could not fix the global economy by themselves in the old Group of Eight club. Emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil, South Korea and South Africa had to be brought into the mix and could no longer be treated as second-class citizens. The G20's great contribution to world affairs was its success in managing the global financial crisis and restoring stability to the financial system. The Washington summit in 2008 and the London summit in 2009 did much to avert a new great depression. Unprecedented cooperation between the world's largest economies provided liquidity that limited the contagion of the banking crisis, kept markets open and prevented countries from resorting to protectionism, and provided a stimulus that cushioned the drop in growth. In the years since, it has become fashionable to say that the G20 failed to follow up on its initial success. There is some truth to that. Member states have been unable to agree on a common fiscal policy -- the United States and several emerging powers favored more stimulus, while Germany and the United Kingdom led a coalition for austerity. Much still needs to be done to fix international finance, which remains crisis-prone. And the G20 has been unable to assist in managing the euro crisis. The reason is simple. Once it stepped back from the edge of the precipice, each government began fighting from its own corner. Now, as emerging economies slow down and developed economies show new signs of growth, some may ask whether the G20 still has a role to play. Is it just another talking shop? This view is understandable but wrongheaded. It could do better, but the G20 still matters for the global economy. In a globalized world, no country can pursue a unilateral international economic policy. Instability in a major economy will inevitably destabilize all other economies. We can't go back to the G8, which would leave out the world's second (China), seventh (Brazil) and 10th (India) largest economies. Governments will disagree on the best way to achieve growth, on the right level of regulation, on currency manipulation and much else. But all of these divisions would grow and threaten economic stability if leaders did not formally meet to discuss them. Even if progress is slow, we live with the ever-present risk of a new economic crisis. If one were to occur, a functioning G20 is indispensable. The real problem with the St. Petersburg summit, which contrary to expectations was relatively well-organized by Russia, is that the G20's global economy agenda has being taken over by the Syrian crisis. It is not surprising, but there is a real cost. The world still needs an effective steering committee for the global economy. If there were the remotest possibility of G20 agreement on Syria, it might be worth it, but there isn't. It will be up to Australia, which hosts the next summit in 2014, to get the G20 back on track. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Wright.","Thomas Wright: Syria likely to overshadow G20's purpose: managing global economy .
He says G20 created in 2008 to respond to economic crisis and it was able to avert disaster .
G20 remains key to staving off global economic crises, Wright says .
Wright: Meeting likely won't do much to solve Syrian conflict, but world still needs G20 ."
"(CNN) -- The father of George Zimmerman, the man accused of shooting and killing and unarmed black teen, says the teen threatened to kill Zimmerman and beat him so badly that it forced Zimmerman to shoot Trayvon Martin. ""Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of you're going to die now or you're going to die tonight, something to that effect,"" Robert Zimmerman told Orlando news station WOFL. ""He continued to beat George. At some point, George pulled his pistol. Did what he did."" In the interview Robert Zimmerman, his face obscured because he says he fears for his safety, vehemently defended the shooting that has caused outrage throughout the nation, moved President Obama to call it a tragedy and prompted a federal investigation. Robert Zimmerman told the news station that Martin confronted his son first and pummeled his son continually. ""He was punched in the nose. His nose was broken,"" Robert Zimmerman said. ""He was knocked to the concrete. Trayvon Martin got on top of him and just started beating him. In the face. In his nose, hitting his head on the concrete."" Robert Zimmerman was not there the night of the shooting and did not say during the interview how he knew the details of the altercation. The elder Zimmerman's account was disputed by Martin's family attorney and several other legal experts. A surveillance video taken the night of the incident at police headquarters shows Zimmerman, his hands cuffed, exiting a patrol car. The video, first broadcast Wednesday by ABCNews.com, shows an officer looking at the back of Zimmerman's head. The video did not provide a close-up of Zimmerman's head but some say it shows Zimmerman did not have significant injuries to his face. ""The injuries that made it sound as though he really should have been on a stretcher are not apparent in this tape at all,"" said Marcia Clark, the former prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson trial. ""He moves freely. He moves fluidly, not like someone who has just been through a beating in anyway shape or form, someone's whose head has been pounded on the pavement as hard as described, someone who's nose was broken and bleeding. That tells you a great deal."" Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, said the video is another strong piece of evidence proving her son was killed unjustly. ""I believe that this video is the icing on the cake,"" she said. ""This is not the first part of the evidence that they have had. They have had the 911 tapes and they have also have witnesses. This is in addition to what the Sanford Police Department has always had. There is no problem with this case and he needs to be arrested."" The 17-year-old was shot to death February 26 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, as Martin was walking back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida. He was wearing a hoodie and carrying Skittles candy and a can of iced tea he had purchased from a nearby convenience store. Zimmerman says he killed Martin in self-defense after the teen attacked him in the gated community. Zimmerman has not been arrested and authorities have said said he has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his story of what happened. The shooting has hit a nerve in the nation, sparked a debate about racial profiling and ignited protests and calls for Zimmerman's arrest. Robert Zimmerman said his son is having a hard time dealing with the criticism. ""I never foresaw so much hate coming from the president, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP. Every organization imaginable is trying to get notoriety or profit from this in some way,"" Robert Zimmerman told WOFL. ""But there's so much hate that I have never been involved in hate and George hasn't. It's really unbelievable."" Robert Zimmerman said her son is not racist and race had nothing to do with incident. ""He would do anything to help anybody at any time. He's color blind when it comes to any race,"" Robert Zimmerman said. Tracy Martin, Martin's father, said Wednesday that the 911 tape shows Zimmerman was profiling his son. In a recording of Zimmerman's call to police, some people have said they hear what sounds like a possible racial slur. CNN enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. Angela Corey, the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case, said Tuesday that investigators would look into the allegations that Zimmerman used a racial slur. Martin, who lived in Miami, was visiting Sanford after receiving a 10-day suspension from school, a family spokesman has said. An empty plastic bag found in his book bag was determined to contain marijuana residue. Crump, Martin's parents' attorney, said information regarding the suspension was irrelevant and amounts to a smear campaign against the youth. Florida law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. It has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in Florida. But as more and more information surfaces, the picture of what happened becomes more complicated. Despite the twists and turns in the case Fulton, Martin's mother, says she still has faith in authorities investigating her son's case. ""I feel confident that they're going to do a thorough investigation,"" Fulton said. ""We're trying to be patient, even though it's been over a month. We're trying to be patient, and we're trying to press on for justice."" CNN's Umaro Djau, Deirdre Walsh, Ed Payne and Tracy Sabo contributed to this report.

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- A Christian Carnival. That's how some in Rio have described the mood in the streets of Copacabana Beach, where hundreds of thousands of young pilgrims follow every step of visiting Pope Francis, an outspoken champion of the poor. But not everyone is celebrating in Rio. About 50 kilometers away, in the working-class suburb of Guaratiba, a last-minute change in the pope's schedule due to heavy rainfall had devastating consequences on the lives of local merchants, many whom invested their life savings on preparing for his arrival. They were expecting hundreds of thousands to flock to their community over the weekend. Saturday's events and Sunday's closing Mass were supposed to take place in Guaratiba -- but were moved to Rio's Copacabana Beach. Marcelo Rosa and his friends jumped up when they heard the news, announced earlier this year by Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, that the pope would come to Guaratiba this weekend. Pope to Mass of millions: Get out of church . Rosa got together with his friends and borrowed about $50,000 in U.S. dollars to buy drinks and food to feed the pilgrims. One friend sold his car, another borrowed from the bank. When news came of the event changes, it was devastating to many. ""When they told me it was canceled, I said you're joking, you've got to be joking,"" Rosa said tearfully. I fainted on the spot."" Celia Dias Carneiro, owner of the Maroeste restaurant, had gone to Guaratiba's main square and heeded the call to action: local merchants rushed to stock up on foods and beverages. ""Since the expectations were so high, that tens of thousands were coming, I got scared,"" said Carneiro, who borrowed about $4,000 at a 7% rate to buy extra seafood. ""I was hoping to get my feet out of the mud ... and now look what has happened to me. I am stuck again in the mud again,"" she said. Local organizers heard talks of money-making opportunities and prepared for the big day. An opulent stage was built over a huge field that was formerly part of a protected marshland. After this week's heavy rains, the field became impassable, even by the trucks delivering goods. What we learned about Pope Francis in Brazil . The area has been cordoned off, but the scene of devastation was very visible, attracting angry passers-by shouting in protest and disbelief. According to a Globo news report, the organization responsible for Campus Fidei tried to drain the water, unsuccessfully. Local newspapers, including Portal Guaratiba, said while federal and municipal taxes were used to build Campus Fidei, they were left with the ecological and sanitary repercussion of building a field over marshland and the loss of mangroves. According to a municipal study, this area was part of three marsh systems essential to local fishermen who rely on the local flora and fauna. Paes is expected to address issues related to the cancellation at Guaratiba. In the meantime, Guaratiba residents want their voices to be heard. Local merchants said all they asked for was to be able to sell their merchandise in Copacabana to make up for losses. Others, just wanted to see Pope Francis. ""This left us with such an emptiness, such sadness,"" said Gabriel Giovannotti, a local business owner. ""If he could only drive by and give us a blessing... we would be happier,"" he said. Singing priests revive Catholic Church in Brazil . CNN's Miguel Castro contributed to this report.","Rain, mud deluge Brazilian suburb of Guaratiba .

"(CNN) -- When the White House, back in March, made the unexpected announcement that this month's G-8 summit, long planned to take place in Chicago, was being moved to Camp David, the reasons given were bland: . Camp David was taking over from Chicago ""to facilitate a free-flowing discussion with our close G-8 partners,"" the White House announced. President Obama was said to believe that Camp David was a more intimate setting for the world leaders to get together. There was immediate conversation about the explanation. Past G-8 summits have been known to attract protests that culminated in violence in the streets of the cities where they have been held. Camp David -- the presidential retreat in Catoctin Mountain Park in Frederick County, Maryland -- is about as secure a sealed-off location as exists in this country. No one gets near it who is not supposed to get near it. Originally the Chicago G-8 summit was supposed to be immediately followed in Chicago by a separate summit of the leaders of NATO nations. The NATO meeting is still scheduled for Chicago; like the G-8 meeting, it will be hosted by Obama. Demonstrations are planned, and heavy security will be in place with the intention of keeping protesters well away from where the NATO leaders are convening. Increasingly, over the years, cities that engage in grand talk about ""bringing the world"" to see their many civic and cultural attributes end up going into a defensive crouch at the same time they are welcoming their global visitors. It's the only wise course; we live in an age where terrorists know that the bigger the stage, the greater the opportunity for maximum impact. And in these jittery times, any occasion when a specific city becomes an enormous public stage, it also becomes a presumed potential target. There is an intake of breath that starts before the event commences, and that is not let out until after it concludes. In London, site of this summer's Olympic Games, there have been reports of plans for surface-to-air missiles to be installed as protective measures right in the city, including on the roofs of apartment buildings. Hardly the symbol of a joyous and carefree gathering of the planet's finest young athletes -- but, then, the planet has proved itself to be an often dangerous place, so discus throwers, twirling gymnasts and powerful missiles may have to share the setting. Faster, higher, stronger -- the athletes, and the weapons in place to keep them safe. If the G-8 summit in the isolated and wooded hills of Maryland comes off as a model of protected tranquility, and is followed by messy scenes of street disorder at the NATO summit in Chicago, it will not be surprising if Camp David, which already has a long history of hosting distinguished guests of presidents, becomes the prototype for future top-level gatherings around the world as well as at home. And if that takes place, it will not be as big a shift as it superficially will seem. When the president visits troops in perilous areas overseas, he is described as ""going into a war zone."" But in fact, anywhere in the United States where a president travels these days receives war-zone security treatment. On television, a presidential meeting with dignitaries in a city away from Washington appears to take place in sedate, often elegant, rooms. But behind the camera shot -- outside the buildings where a president and his guests are meeting -- is security befitting preparedness for an imminent attack. Concrete barriers, war wagons filled with security personnel with automatic weapons at the ready, human ring after human ring of law enforcement assigned to keep all unauthorized persons away ... the heart of any city where a modern-era president passes through is routinely turned into a temporary militarized bunker. As early as 1968, when political violence stained the year, people were predicting that future presidential campaigns might be conducted solely from television studios. Some said this would never happen; security fears aside, the public would never allow its leaders to speak to them from such a sterile and locked-off environment. Yet, in a backhanded way, it has turned out to be true. The television studio has become the moving impermeable bubble where a president resides when he is out in the nation. Camp David, a bucolic federal campsite turned into a presidential retreat by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who called it USS Shangri-La, was renamed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in honor of his grandson. It was widely seen as a way for presidents to get some peace and quiet, away from the tension and tumult of their daily world. To dress and act casually, free from staring eyes. Few people, of course, have firsthand knowledge of what it is like there. Ronald Reagan summed up the feeling in his autobiography: . ""The president's home at Camp David, called Aspen, is a beautiful rustic house with beamed ceilings, wood-paneled walls ... Nancy and I experienced a sense of liberation at Camp David that we never found in Washington. Because the perimeter was guarded, we could just open a door and take a walk. That's a freedom, incidentally, that you don't fully appreciate until you've lost it."" Foreign dignitaries came to call on presidents there, in a less formal, more relaxed setting than official Washington. While most Americans can envision the White House, they never have really seen, in full, Camp David. You can't tour the place, or even look at it from outside. There have been references to it in popular entertainment: the 1965 Fletcher Knebel political thriller novel, ""Night of Camp David""; the scene in the 1995 motion picture ""The American President"" in which Michael Douglas, as a widower president, sits with the woman he is falling in love with, played by Annette Bening, watching television in his (movie-set) Camp David cabin. There is a subtle difference at play in the way the G-8 summit at Camp David is being regarded. It's not so much that the president and his guests want to get away from the world. It's that a way needed to be found to keep the world away from them. Will that turn out to be the way of the future? With the possible exception of the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, there is perhaps no other place in the country designed so determinedly for absolute privacy. (From the official description of Fort Knox provided by the U.S. Mint: ""No visitors are permitted, and no exceptions are made."") Whatever else happens at the G-8 summit, that thought, and its implications, are what may endure. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","President Obama has moved this month's G-8 summit from Chicago to Camp David .

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's state oil company rejected criticism from a leading human rights group Wednesday, calling an Amnesty International report ""inaccurate."" File image of Shell's oil and gas terminal on Bonny Island in southern Nigeria's Niger Delta. ""We have issues with the report,"" said Levi Ajuonoma, a spokesman for Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Amnesty said Tuesday that pollution and environmental impacts from the oil industry in the Niger Delta are creating a ""human rights tragedy"" in which local people suffer poor health and loss of livelihood. Governments and oil companies are failing to be accountable for the problems, Amnesty said in its report, called ""Petroleum, Pollution and Poverty in the Niger Delta."" But the state oil company said it was local communities who cause much of the environmental damage by vandalizing pipelines for monetary gain. ""We take environmental damage very seriously,"" Ajuonoma said. ""Pipeline damage is a major cause of pollution,"" he argued, blaming ""communities who... vandalize pipelines and make claims on the oil company operating in the area."" Amnesty leveled a wide range of charges in its report. ""People living in the Niger Delta have to drink, cook with and wash in polluted water,"" said Audrey Gaughran, who co-authored the report. ""They eat fish contaminated with oil and other toxins -- if they are lucky enough to be able to still find fish. The land they farm on is being destroyed. ""After oil spills, the air they breathe smells of oil, gas and other pollutants. People complain of breathing problems and skin lesions, and yet neither the government nor the oil companies monitor the human impacts of oil pollution."" The report looks at oil spills, gas flaring, waste dumping and other environmental impacts from the oil industry. The majority of the evidence in the report relates to Shell, the main oil company operating in the region. ""Despite its public claims to be a socially and environmentally responsible corporation, Shell continues to directly harm human rights through its failure to adequately prevent and mitigate pollution and environmental damage in the Niger Delta,"" Gaughran said. A Shell spokesman said the company shares Amnesty's concern for the people in the Niger Delta but disputes the group's assessment of its corporate accountability. ""We feel that the root causes of the Niger Delta's humanitarian issues are poverty, corruption, crime, militancy, and violence. This report does not acknowledge these issues to any substantive degree, but concentrates on oil and gas issues in isolation, and as such, its value is limited,"" said a spokesman at the company's headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands, who asked not to be identified per company policy. ""This report brings no new insights or analysis to help oil companies such as SPDC improve managing the issues of the Niger Delta,"" the Shell spokesman said. ""Instead, in parts it draws wide-ranging and superficial conclusions from a number of these deeply complex issues, offering little underlying analysis to support those conclusions."" SPDC is the Shell Petroleum Development Company, the national oil and gas company in Nigeria. Shell owns a 30-percent stake in the company while the Nigerian government owns 55 percent. The Niger Delta is a region in Nigeria consisting of nine oil-producing states. It has a land area of about 46,500 square miles (75,000 square km) -- about the same size as the Czech Republic or the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). An area of rich biological diversity, the region contains the world's third-largest wetland with the most extensive freshwater swamp forest, according to the UNDP. More than half the area contains creeks and small islands, while the rest is rainforest, the UNDP says. At the same time, the Niger Delta produces the oil wealth that accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's foreign earnings, the UNDP says. Amnesty says the majority of people living in the Niger Delta depend on the natural environment for their food and livelihood, particularly through agriculture and fisheries. Shell said it is not responsible for some 80 percent of the pollution in the oil-rich area, because that pollution is the result of attacks and sabotage of Shell operations in the Niger Delta. ""Over the past four weeks alone we had eight attacks,"" he said. ""These attacks had a substantial impact on the environment, and assets, and most importantly for the people that live and work there."" About 85 percent of the oil spills from Shell operations are the result of attacks and sabotage, he said. Nigeria's main militant group, the Movement for Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks on the region's oil infrastructure in recent months. MEND said Sunday it had attacked an offshore facility and that it was engulfed in flames. Last week, the group said it had destroyed a pipeline owned and operated by the Italian gas company Agip. Also last week, MEND claimed to have destroyed Shell's main trunk line in Bayelsa state and a Chevron oil station in the region. MEND demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be invested in the Niger Delta instead of enriching those whom the militants consider to be corrupt politicians. Last year, a series of MEND attacks forced Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as much as 40 percent. Amnesty's report acknowledged that armed groups and communities have worsened the pollution problem by vandalizing oil infrastructure or stealing oil, but it said the scale of the problem is not clear. Shell said plans are under way to deal with the problem of gas flaring, which happens when crude oil is brought to the surface along with the large volumes of gas that have been trapped with it. The gas used to be burned off safely in a process called flaring, but that process is now considered a waste of resources and revenue for the government, Shell says. A $3 billion program to reduce the gas flares has already been able to cut them by 30 percent, the company said. The Amnesty report also pointed the finger at governments and said they have failed to be held accountable for the situation of the people. The Niger Delta covers 185 different local government areas, according to the United Nations Development Program. ""The government must address the human impact of oil industry pollution,"" said Gaughran, of Amnesty. ""They have a duty to protect their citizens from human rights abuse or harm by businesses and they are failing in that duty."" Shell supports ""collaborative solutions"" between communities, governments, corporations and non-profit groups as the only way to address the problems listed in the Amnesty report, the spokesman said. ""The SPDC definitely shares Amnesty International's concern that the people in the Niger Delta haven't benefited from the extraction of the oil and gas as they should,"" the spokesman said, ""but this has been the opinion of the SPDC for a number of years.""

"(CNN) -- One of al Qaeda's most influential figures in North Africa has been killed by French and Chadian forces, a U.S. official said Friday. French military sources had earlier said that Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, a deputy leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, was killed in an airstrike in Mali late last month. Abou Zeid was one of the group's most ruthless commanders, having seized at least a dozen foreigners for ransom. At least two have been killed; several French citizens remain captive. ""He was a senior influential member of AQIM, and his death represents a significant blow to AQIM's efforts to use West Africa, and Mali in particular, as a safe haven,"" the official told CNN. Military sources quoted by French media say that in the past few days, Abou Zeid and a substantial number of his fighters were killed during a French bombardment near Aguelhok in northern Mali. His death was first reported by an Algerian television station Ennahar. A spokesman for the French Defense Ministry refused to comment on the reports. The ministry did say air force operations are continuing, including in the Tessalit region, where close to 100 air sorties were carried out this week. Aguelhok is a remote town close to mountains and the Algerian border -- in a region where many Islamist fighters had regrouped in the face of the French push toward the main cities of the north. According to analysts, it is an area that Abou Zeid was intimately familiar with, as for years it was his main base of operations before Islamists took over much of northern Mali. For much of the last year, a constellation of jihadist forces including Abou Zeid had controlled large parts of northern Mali after ethnic Tuareg rebels had forced the army to retreat. He spent much of his time in and around Timbuktu, partly at a luxurious mansion that had been built for Moammar Gadhafi, according to reports from the city. At the beginning of this year, Abou Zeid joined other Islamist forces making a push southward toward the capital, Bamako. But when the Islamist advances prompted a French intervention, he moved to the area around the less accessible city of Kidal, close to the virtually impenetrable Ifoghas Mountains. Abou Zeid had been promoted by the emir of AQIM -- and fellow Algerian -- Abdelmalek Droukdel. Droukdel saw him as a loyal counter to the growing power of a rival jihadist commander, Moktar Belmoktar, the man who ordered the hostage attack on the Algerian gas plant in January. Abou Zeid's ruthlessness -- and his growing influence -- were confirmed three years ago when he ordered the beheading of an elderly British tourist -- Edwin Dyer -- who'd been seized by his group early in 2009. When Malian authorities rounded up a number of al Qaeda suspects in response, Abou Zeid sent a hit squad to the Timbuktu home of a senior intelligence officer, who was shot dead. The following year, a French aid worker, 78-year old Michel Germaneau, was killed as French commandos tried to rescue him. Abou Zeid's group also staged a raid on a uranium mine in neighboring Niger -- abducting seven workers, four of whom, all French, are still being held. One of the few Westerners to have encountered Abou Zeid was a French citizen, Pierre Camatte, who was abducted from a hotel in northern Mali in November 2009. ""Physically, there is nothing remarkable about Abou Zeid,"" he told Le Monde's Isabelle Mandraud after his release. ""He is small, and thin. But he seems to be highly respected by members of his entourage."" ""He wanted to know whether I knew of any mapping websites on the Internet, Russian websites, so that he could have real-time images."" Abou Zeid's hostage-taking provoked a trial of strength with Belmoktar, who had generated significant funds for jihad from ransom payments for foreign hostages. By all accounts, the two were very different characters. Abou Zeid had a reputation for extreme brutality and thuggishness, while Belmoktar developed a reputation for strategic cunning. Analysts tell CNN that despite their rivarly, the two men found ways to coexist. The fall of Gadhafi in Libya gave both men the opportunity to take their operations northward into Libya from their sub-Saharan strongholds. Sources briefed by Western intelligence told CNN that Belmoktar and Abou Zeid made trips to Libya to explore the possibility of cooperation with local Libyan jihadist groups, secure weapons supplies and scout out possible locations for training facilities. Abou Zeid made several trips to Libya in 2011, according to one source familiar with intelligence from the area. He was one of several al Qaeda figures in North Africa who had fought in Algeria's vicious insurgency in the 1990s, when whole villages were massacred and atrocities were committed by both Islamist militants and Algeria's counterterrorism forces. As a child growing up in a poor region of southern Algeria, Abou Zeid had little formal schooling, but his intimate knowledge of the border with Libya made him an expert smuggler. According to Dario Cristiani, writing in the Jamestown Foundation's Militant Leadership Monitor, he was radicalized by several run-ins with the Algerian authorities. And he was at the heart of the transformation of the Algerian insurgency into an al Qaeda affiliate. Abou Zeid's death casts further uncertainty over the fate of the French hostages his group is still believed to hold. In December, before the French intervention in Mali, he accused the French authorities of blocking negotiations for their safe release. Several of the hostages had appeared in videos warning against military intervention for the sake of their own safety. In one video, with masked men holding AK-47s behind them, the men look exhausted and terrified. Andrew Lebovich, a Senegal-based analyst who recently traveled to Mali, told CNN there is concern that Abou Zeid transported a number of Western hostages with him after he left Timbuktu. If Abou Zeid was indeed killed, the expectation is his group will retaliate. ""According to available accounts, he was somebody who generated fierce respect and loyalty in his men, so unless his fighting force has been severely degraded, there's a chance his group may lash out to avenge his death in the days and weeks ahead,"" Lebovich said.","NEW: U.S. official confirms death of Abdelhamid Abou Zeid .

"(CNN) -- After months of hype and speculation, the Samsung Galaxy Gear smart watch arrived this week with a bang... followed by a whimper. Some commentators were impressed with the device's technical specifications including its 320 x 320-pixel, 1.63-inch AMOLED touchscreen, an 800MHz processor, a 315mAh battery, and the camera mounted in the wrist strap capable of capturing 1.9-megapixel stills and 10-second video clips. But many were disappointed by the countless features the smart watch did not include. Prior to the Galaxy Gear's launch, the internet was awash with fervent speculation as to what the watch would do. Many hoped that it would come replete with remarkable features such as acting as a projector, or allowing you to check your pulse and body temperature. Some commentators envisaged a watch made of radical new lightweight or transparent materials that could interface with the world around you to offer a genuine new experience not currently offered by smartphones or tablets. Read more: 20 wearable technologies from the future . At the device's glamorous launch, JK Shin, president of Samsung's IT and Mobile Division, said that the ""Samsung Galaxy Gear benefits consumers by integrating smart device technology even deeper into their everyday lives, and bridges the gap between the mobile device and fashion worlds to create truly wearable technology."" But does it really deliver on its promise? CNN spoke to a number of amateur designers who had mocked up smart watch ideas of their own about their impressions of the Galaxy Gear. Most seemed united in their disappointment. ""I'm waiting for a smart watch that does something extra than just bring my phone to my wrist,"" says design engineer Esben Oxholm, who mocked up his own smart watch concept in February. ""I can't tell you what it is, because I don't know. I just know that I'm not paying 300 to 400 bucks for a wrist attaching remote control that needs to be recharged every day."" Christoph Behling, lead designer for Tag Heuer watches, shared Oxholm's criticisms, saying that in his view the Galaxy Gear will not serve as a replacement for regular watches, because it is lacking in two fundamental aspects: both in its form and its function. ""At the moment, it is a decent enough electronics product, but it is not a decent enough watch,"" Behling says. ""I can't see how it will benefit my life. Do I really want to leave my lovely Swiss watch at home in order to have a piece of mass produced consumer product with, in my view, limited functionality?"" Behling says that Samsung's decision to tie the Galaxy Gear to a mobile phone means it cannot act as a proper cell phone substitute. Equally, he thinks that its rather industrial looking design, with exposed screws and a metallic finish will win few fans: ""They didn't really engage with the idea that the watch is an accessory. It needs to be more targeted to a specific lifestyle where it delivers a particular function."" Not all reviews have been negative. TechCrunch reporter Matt Burns praised the Galaxy Gear's 'attractive' screen and design; The Verge's Vlad Savov described it as ""quite unlike anything you've seen before."" Some have noted that the smart watches have in fact been about for years. Others say that the smart watch proper still hasn't been invented. Through all the fevered commentary, technological enthusiasts continue to draw up their own visions of what a smart watch should be. Many now rest their hopes on Apple to deliver the device they are waiting for, with countless speculative designs being proffered by the vast community of ""Macolytes."" So how far are we still from a watch that offers haptic feedback, wrist-based payments, gesture controls, and agnostic support for devices regardless of whether they are iOS, Android or Windows phone? According to some commentators, we are still Galaxies away.","Samsung launch new 'smart watch' with built in camera and pedometer .

"(CNN) -- A driver who confessed in an online video that his drunken driving killed a man now faces a homicide charge. A grand jury in Franklin County, Ohio, indicted Matthew Cordle on Monday on charges of aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, more than two months after the deadly wrong-way collision. The 22-year-old's online admission that he was to blame has been watched more than a million times on YouTube. Now, Ohio's legal system must decide what punishment fits his crime. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of eight and a half years in prison, prosecutor Ron O'Brien said. Polarizing video . ""My name is Matthew Cordle, and on June 22nd, 2013, I hit and killed Vincent Canzani,"" he says in the video posted last week. In the video, he recounts how he was out with friends, drank heavily and lost control the night of June 22. Canzani, 61, died when a wrong-way driver hit his Jeep on Interstate 670 near Columbus, Ohio. The video was posted on a website called ""because I said I would,"" which provides a forum for people to make promises to others. Some viewers were impressed by Cordle's apparent courage and his plea, ""I'm begging you, please don't drink and drive."" But some viewers thought the video was ""a crock,"" in the words of one commenter on the video site, aimed at reducing Cordle's probable prison sentence. Remorse called genuine . Canzani's ex-wife, Cheryl Oates, says she believes Cordle's remorse is genuine. ""He said I made a huge mistake, and I'm going to take what's coming to me,"" Oates said. ""You've got to respect him for that."" Oates said Cordle should spend time in prison. But as a mother of two sons, she also feels pain for Cordle when she watches the video. ""It's gut-wrenching coming from a mother looking at that young boy, and he just doesn't understand the damage that he did,"" she said. Lawyer: Leniency isn't goal . Cordle has pledged to plead guilty and said on his video, ""I'm handing the prosecution everything they need to put me away for a very long time."" O'Brien said the video has not influenced him to recommend a lighter sentence. ""We had a case against him based on the evidence as I know it before the video was filmed,"" he said. Cordle's lawyer, George S. Breitmayer III, said leniency was not the goal of Cordle's video. ""Despite any speculation of his intentions, the video was meant to raise awareness related to the serious issues surrounding drinking and driving,"" the defense lawyer said in a statement sent to CNN. ""In addition, (Cordle) hopes his confession will offer the Canzanis some level of closure by avoiding any lengthy, drawn out legal proceedings.""","NEW: An Ohio grand jury has indicted Matthew Cordle .

"New York (CNN) -- He's at it again. After naming tall sugary drinks Public Enemy No. 1, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday unveiled another public health initiative. This one would force city retailers to keep tobacco products out of sight. But does out of sight necessarily mean out of mind? ""Young people are targets of marketing and the availability of cigarettes,"" said the mayor. The legislation ""will help prevent another generation from the ill health and shorter life expectancy that comes with smoking."" Bloomberg explains new push against tobacco . It's just the latest in a string of New York health initiatives blamed by some for eroding personal freedoms and contributing to a so-called nanny-state. Last week a New York judge invalidated the city's ban on sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces. It was Bloomberg who first championed that ban, calling it part of a cure for New York's ""obesity epidemic."" Supreme Court Justice Milton Tingling called the drink restrictions ""arbitrary and capricious."" The judges decision is under appeal. N.Y. mayor seeks ban on plastic foam containers . Under the Tobacco Product Display Restriction bill, sellers would have to keep tobacco products hidden, in cabinets, under the counter or behind a curtain, except during a purchase by an adult or during restocking. If it passes, New York would become the nation's first city to enact such a law, Bloomberg said. The mayor said the city is trying to dissuade customers from viewing cigarettes as ""normal."" ""Smoking is going to kill these kids,"" he said Monday on CNN's ""The Lead"" in an interview with Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper. ""It's going to leave them with not the great career prospects that you'd like, not the education that you'd like."" Opposition to the measure was not long in coming. ""The notion of forcing licensed, tax-collecting, law-abiding retailers to hide their tobacco inventory is patently absurd,"" said Jim Calvin, president of the New York Association of Convenience Stores, which says it represents some 1,600 retail stores. ""This proposal arises from a wild theory that the mere sight of packs of cigarettes on a wall behind the store counter compels kids to start smoking,"" Calvin continuted. A spokesman for the parent company of Philip Morris USA, whose cigarette brands include Marlboro, Chesterfield and Virginia Slims, said the manufacturer opposes the measure because ""we believe it goes too far."" ""We supported enactment of federal legislation in 2009 that gave FDA the power to regulate tobacco products, including at retail,"" David Sutton, communications and media representative for Altria Group, said in a statement. ""To the extent that this proposed law would ban the display of products to adult tobacco consumers, we believe it goes too far."" New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas A. Farley said smoking rates among New York's young people have remained flat since 2007. Bloomberg's bill, he said, is an important next step in protecting teens from tobacco. New York's comprehensive smoking prevention program has led to a decrease in the smoking rate in adults, Farley said. Judge stops NYC ban on large sugary drinks, city plans appeal . Another piece of legislation, the Sensible Tobacco Enforcement bill, targets illegal cigarette smuggling. The bill would increase penalties for retailers who sell tobacco without a license or fail to pay tobacco taxes. It would also prohibit the sale of discounted tobacco products. Retailers could continue to advertise tobacco products and their price information under the proposed legislation. In 1988, New York City passed the Smoke Free Air Act, which banned smoking in public restrooms and taxicabs. Lawmakers toughened the law in 2002, to ban smoking in public indoor areas, including restaurants and bars. In 2011, Bloomberg signed a bill banning smoking in many other public places, including New York City parks and public beaches.","Tobacco Product Display Restriction bill would make sellers hide tobacco products .

"New York (CNN) -- A 23-year-old man was arraigned Saturday on a murder charge in the death of a toddler shot as his parents pushed him in a stroller across a Brooklyn street. Howard Jackson, a prosecutor with the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, told reporters Saturday that Daquan Breland faces a criminal possession of a weapon charge in addition to second-degree murder. At his initial appearance Saturday, Breland was ordered to remain behind bars; he's scheduled to next be in court September 12, according to Jackson. Breland is on parole for a felony assault in upstate New York, according to police. A call placed by CNN on Saturday night to his court-appointed attorney, George Sheinberg, was not immediately returned. Breland and another young man, Daquan Wright, were apprehended Friday morning by New York detectives and U.S. marshals at a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, apartment according to New York police Commissioner Ray Kelly. ""They fled New York City almost immediately after this incident and that's where they were located,"" Jackson said of the central Pennsylvania city. Wright, a 19-year-old from Brooklyn, was charged Saturday with criminal possession of a weapon. Their arrests stem from last Sunday evening, when 16-month-old Antiq Hennis was in a stroller on Livonia Avenue in Brooklyn. An eyewitness said Breland opened fire after Wright handed him a gun, according to Kelly, who did not cite a possible motive. Antiq was shot in the left side of his head, according to police. The toddler was transported to Brookdale University Hospital and pronounced dead on arrival. Both men have some kind of relationship with the young boy's father, 21-year-old Anthony Hennis, who as of Friday had declined to be interviewed, according to Kelly. Jackson said Saturday that he personally hadn't yet spoken with Anthony Hennis, though his hope was that he'd be cooperative. As to the case, the prosecutor said it was hard not to feel for the boy's kin. ""I haven't prosecuted a case like this before,"" said Jackson, who handles homicide cases for his office. ""... Even if you don't know this child, you couldn't help but grieve for the family."" CNN's Erinn Cawthon contributed to this report.","Daquan Breland is charged with murder and criminal weapons possession .

"(CNN) -- New York police are weighing whether to pursue hate crime charges in the vicious beating of a white man last week. The suspect in the beating, who is black, was heard making statements similar to ""I'm going to punch the first white man I see,"" according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. The department's Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the incident. The 62-year-old victim, identified by a neighbor as Jeffrey Babbitt, is in critical condition at Bellevue Hospital after the Wednesday attack, Kelly said. Two other men were also assaulted as they tried to help Babbitt, police said. Lashawn Marten has been charged with three counts of assault, one of them a felony. He was being held in the Manhattan Detention Complex as of Sunday, according to its website. Robert Pizzimenti, a neighbor of Babbitt's, described the man as ""a lovable guy.""

"New York (CNN) -- Michelle Matson has a nagging reminder of the cycling crash that could have killed her. A year and a half later, flecks of asphalt remain lodged in her skin.

""My body was destroyed,"" said Matson, an artist living in Brooklyn. ""My whole life was put on hold for months, and no one seemed to care."" It happened in October, 2010, on what Matson and her boyfriend, James Paz, thought was an innocuous bike ride home from a concert. ""I was riding in front of Michelle, about 10 feet in front of her,"" Paz said.  ""I heard a loud scraping, scratching noise, there was a second of blackness, and then I was flying through the air."" What had lofted Paz into the air was a speeding driver who, according to witnesses, fled the scene. Paz hobbled to his feet, noted the mangled remains of his bike and scanned the area for Matson. When he did not see her, he panicked. ""I was screaming her name,"" Paz said. ""Then I saw her lying in the middle of the right-hand lane of the road ... at that time I didn't know if she was alive."" No charges have been filed in the case. Matson's story is a reminder of a growing problem in many of the nation's busy, sprawling urban landscapes: More people are using bikes for transportation amid a culture and infrastructure designed for automobiles. Although New York police and the city's Department of Transportation report increasing bicyclists, the number of bike deaths has remained steady. In fact, overall traffic deaths have dropped by 39% since 2001, according to the NYPD. But that statistic offers little comfort to Matson. It's not just the facts of the incident -- or even the tiny particles of debris from the New York City street still in Matson's body -- that have left her upset. It's what Matson describes as investigative inertia by the New York City Police Department when it came to her case. ""There were no legal repercussions for the driver whatsoever, because the NYPD chose not to investigate the hit-and-run,"" Matson said. ""It blows my mind that this is even possible ... people get in worse trouble for double-parking."" In 2010, in more than 6,000 New York City traffic accidents involving cyclists, 36 people died, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles. Transportation Nation reported that no criminal charges were filed against the drivers involved. One woman -- the mother of an artist named Mathieu Lefevre, who was killed on a bike -- is on a crusade to learn more about his death and to make roads safer for cyclists. There is a growing sense among the city's cycling community that to many authorities, bicyclists don't matter. ""Cyclists and pedestrians are being killed and seriously injured all over our city, once every 35 hours in fact,"" New York City Councilman James Vacca said at a hearing this year. ""And the drivers are literally getting away with it."" CNN repeatedly contacted the NYPD for comment about Matson's hit-and-run and the department's policy about cycling accident investigations, but did not receive a response. Cyclists who think police are biased against them are fueled by another statistic: In 2011, the NYPD issued 10,415 criminal court summonses to truck operators. During the same year, 34,813 summonses were issued to bicyclists. ""While there may be some lawbreaking among the cycling population, very few if any of those transgressions of the law are resulting in death or serious injury,"" said Paul Steely White, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a bicycling advocacy group. ""But when a trucker runs the red light or speeds, the consequences very often are deadly."" There are also problems, in the eyes of lawmakers and advocates alike, with how crashes are investigated. According to statements made by the NYPD, only traffic accidents involving imminent or actual death are investigated. Those cases are handled by one of 19 members of a special unit called the Accident Investigation Squad, or AIS. ""Their role is to utilize their special training to conduct a more comprehensive investigation, employing a variety of techniques in order to establish speed, analyze skid marks and other physical characteristics of the accident scene,"" said John Cassidy, executive officer of the Transportation Bureau of the NYPD, at a City Council hearing in February. ""In essence, reconstruct the accident so that a more definitive cause, possibly resulting in criminal charges, may be determined."" But with only 19 detectives, AIS resources are stretched, so members of the unit are not always deployed, even when death is imminent, according to activists. ""Staffing for these crashes is not what it should be,"" said Steve Vaccaro, an attorney with Rankin and Taylor, a law firm specializing in cases involving bicycling accidents. ""This resource is not what it should be if we're going to have these investigations."" The issue has hit the blogosphere. Advocates are pushing for a law that would force police to investigate all serious bike accidents. For Matson and Paz, virtually no investigation of their case occurred, they say. That leaves Matson, who still struggles with a debilitating injury to her left leg, with little legal recourse after her accident. ""If you lose your limbs in a [bike] crash, you don't get an investigation,"" said White, the bicycling advocate. ""Without that investigation, it's virtually impossible to hold reckless drivers accountable when they do break traffic laws and they seriously injure pedestrians or cyclists."" Perhaps not surprisingly, a year and a half after her hit-and-run, Matson has refused to ride a bike.","Bicyclist struggles with injury to her left leg a year and a half after hit-and-run .

"Kingston, Ontario (CNN) -- A Canadian jury Sunday convicted three members of a family of Afghan immigrants of the ""honor"" murders of four female relatives whose bodies were found in an Ontario canal. Mohammed Shafia, 58; his wife, Tooba Mohammad Yahya, 42; and their son, Hamed, 21, were found guilty of first-degree murder in the deaths of Shafia's three teenage daughters and his first wife in his polygamous marriage. Sunday's verdicts followed a three-month trial, in which jurors heard wiretaps of Shafia referring to his daughters as ""whores"" and ranting about their behavior. All three were sentenced to life in prison immediately after their convictions, with no chance of parole for 25 years. ""This is a good day for Canadian justice. Our democratic society protects the rights of all,"" Gerard Laarhuis, the chief prosecutor in the case, told reporters outside the courthouse in Kingston. ""It's a very bad day, because this jury found that four strong, vivacious and freedom-loving women were murdered by their own family."" At least one Shafia family supporter interrupted Laarhuis with shouts of ""lies"" and called the verdict a ""miscarriage of justice."" But others cheered the verdict as Laarhuis continued. The three Shafia sisters -- Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13 -- were found dead inside a car that plunged into the Rideau Canal in Kingston on June 30, 2009. Shafia's first wife, 50-year-old Rona Amir Mohammad, also died. The verdicts came on the second day of deliberations for a seven-woman, five-man jury in Kingston, about 280 km (175 miles) west of the family's home in Montreal. There was no immediate comment from defense attorneys. Prosecutors said the girls' father, mother and brother all plotted to kill the four women in an ""honor"" murder. Investigators claimed that hours of wiretapped conversations reveal a premeditated plan to punish rebellious, Westernized daughters and their permissive advocate, Rona. Shafia and Yahya admitted on the stand that they were upset with Zainab for running off to marry a Pakistani man they hated, that Sahar wore revealing clothes and had secret boyfriends, and Geeti was failing in school and calling social workers to get her out of a home in turmoil. Prosecutors argued that under instructions from his father, Hamed Shafia used the family Lexus to ram the other family car carrying the women into the canal. The shattered headlight on the Lexus, they claim, matches the damage on the rear bumper of the family Nissan in which the women were found dead. Investigators also believed the victims might have died before they hit the water, because they were unable to escape despite their seat belts being unbuckled and the car being submerged in just 7 feet of water. In the three-month-long trial, Shafia testified, ""My children did a lot of cruelty toward me,"" as he wept openly on the stand. He went on to say he believed his children ""betrayed"" him by dating and he did not hide his anger, saying a father would never expect that kind of behavior from this daughters. In taking the stand, Shafia swore to tell the truth on the Quran and he again invoked the holy book to say Islam does not condone killing people to preserve a family's honor. In a direct response to a question from prosecutor Laurie Lacelle, Shafia said, ""To kill someone, you can't regain your respect and honor. Respected lady, you should know that. In our religion, a person who kills his wife or daughter, there is nothing more dishonorable. How is it possible that someone would do that to their children, respected lady?"" ""You might do it,"" Lacelle calmly replied, ""if you thought they were whores."" Shafia had used that term in a conversation captured by wiretaps. Investigators played hours of the wiretap recordings in court, alleging many conversations involving the three suspects prove they were plotting murder. In some of the most shocking conversations, Shafia launched into a rant about his daughters' behavior. ""I say to myself, 'You did well. Would they come back to life a hundred times, you should so the same again,'"" he says. And in another played in court and translated from the Afghan language Dari, he says, ""May the devil defecate on their graves! This is what a daughter should be? Would a daughter be such a whore?"" Shafia and his lawyers tried to explain that his shocking words are traditional expressions in Dari that should not be translated literally. But the jury also heard from an expert witness on honor murders -- a term CNN is using in the interest of clarity rather than the more common ""honor killings"" because the latter phrase does not properly describe the alleged crime. That witness, University of Toronto professor Shahrzad Mojab, said that in some families, honor is worth more than life. In an interview with CNN, Mojab said that many times, honor crimes are calculated acts that involve more than one family member. ""There is a very important difference between honor killing and violence against women in the form of domestic violence. It is plotted, it is premeditated."" Mojab said. ""What we need to understand is that the male power and the male desire for the control of the woman's body and the woman's sexuality -- the honor resides in that sort of understanding and the ownership of women's body and sexuality,"" he said. ""So when that is being presented in a way that is not acceptable to the social norm, then the only way the honor can be restored is by purifying that. And the purification is through blood.""","NEW: The defendants were sentenced to life in prison following the verdict .

"(CNN) -- As they pressed their case in Washington to lawmakers and the national media, Trayvon Martin's parents also explained they are not trying to make money off their slain son's name. Last week, Travyon's mother, Sybrina Fulton, filed two applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to trademark the phrases ""I am Trayvon"" and ""Justice for Trayvon."" Both phrases have become a rallying cry for supporters of the 17-year-old who was shot and killed February 26 in Sanford, Florida, by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, who has said he was acting in self-defense. Martin's parents and supporters dispute Zimmerman's claim and want him arrested. What the witnesses are saying . ""We just appreciate the support that we've been receiving,"" Fulton told reporters Wednesday. ""We're thinking about next steps and the plans we need to take right now to try to get some justice for our son."" Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family, addressed the trademark issue in a news conference on Capitol Hill late Tuesday after appearing with Martin's parents at a forum on racial profiling and hate crimes. ""We keep getting called about trademarks and this kind of thing,"" Crump said. ""There are so many people out there doing things with Trayvon's name and some inappropriate people, so without that trademark they did not have the right to tell them to cease and desist."" Crump noted the attorneys who filed the trademark application volunteered to do so for the family. Fulton's trademark applications covered digital media, CDs and DVDs featuring Trayvon Martin. Kimra Major-Morris, another lawyer for the family who filed the trademark applications, said the family was worried others could use the phrases to exploit the Florida teen's death. One example she gave was someone falsely claiming to be raising funds for the family. ""There are going to be many, and we've seen them already, who don't have the family's best interest at heart,"" Major-Morris said. ""The purpose of the trademark filings is to protect against exploitation and to keep the heat on an arrest and that is really our goal and the family is not interested in a profit."" Major-Morris said Martin's family supported efforts such as the public service announcement released this week by Grammy-winning singer Chaka Khan and is not trying to prevent people from using the phrases on T-shirts or hoodies, items they believe are helpful to their cause. Major-Morris said Martin's family planned to start a foundation in his name and it was important to protect these phrases for the foundation's eventual use. The goal of the foundation, she said, will be to help other families who are going through similar situations. Two days after Fulton's applications were filed, Los Angeles musician Marcus Singletary applied for a trademark for ""Justice for Trayvon"" hooded sweatshirts. Evolution of the hoodie . ""In my opinion, Trayvon's parents were correct when they cited the lack of civility by some popular media figures who have chosen to find significance in dissecting a teenager's wardrobe as a somehow 'factual' explanation for the child's untimely (and, apparently, permissible) death by firearm,"" Singletary wrote to CNN in an e-mail. ""The phrase summarizes the goals that we progressive-minded Americans have defined for ourselves, regarding the incident in question and its potential aftermath."" Singletary also said he would ""love to provide assistance to the family"" assuming the product is successful. Applying for trademarks will not provide immediate legal protection for the family, according to trademark lawyers, because the applications usually take a year or more to process.","Trayvon Martin's mom seeks to trademark ""I am Trayvon"" and ""Justice for Trayvon""

"Hong Kong, (CNN) -- In the history of power couples who met at work, there's Michelle and Barack Obama, BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z, and, yes, even Pam and Jim from ""The Office."" And then there's Melinda and Bill Gates. Jointly helming a multi-billion dollar philanthropic foundation, they are firmly at the top of the power couple pyramid. A married couple who met at work is not a particularly rare thing. Three in ten workers who have dated a colleague said in a recent survey by CareerBuilder.com that their office romance eventually led to marriage. But for Melinda, the situation was different. While at Microsoft, where she rose to General Manager of Information Products, she was dating the big boss. Let me rephrase that. She was dating the extraordinarily wealthy and powerful founder of Microsoft whose software powered the PC revolution. So, was it tough? ""Sure,"" she tells me. ""I had very clear boundaries, and my teams knew that -- that I did not go home and discuss work with Bill because he was the CEO."" ""And I think that allowed me to be effective with them and for them to know that I was leading them as a team."" Recently in Kuala Lumpur, we had a wide-ranging and refreshingly frank conversation about her work as the co-founder of one of the world's largest private foundations. We talked about her goals at the foundation, namely her plan to get modern contraceptives to another 120 million women around the world by 2020. But for CNN's Leading Women series, I wanted to get to get something else out of the interview -- a chance to hear straight from one of the world's most powerful women on how to power ahead (without relying on that overused phrase ""work-life balance"". As co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, her job involves major policy goals from education reform to polio eradication. A typical day at the office may include strategy reviews and one-on-one meetings, but a substantial amount of her work happens out on the field. Gates spends a third of her time on the road. She says carving out quality time for both her work and her family is a struggle that she manages through considerable planning and bringing the kids to work. ""Some of my trips I actually plan around their school breaks,"" she says. ""So, all three of our children have been with us to Africa."" ""Bill and I go over our calendars a lot to make sure as much as we can that one of us is home when we can be and to make sure that the kids know they really are the center of our lives."" Both Mr. and Mrs. Gates endeavor to drive the children to school, tuck them into bed at night, and cheer them on from the sidelines. And if Bill is about to shirk family time for other matters, Melinda will call him on it. ""There was a science fair recently at at school. Bill had promised he would be there. I signed up for something on the road and he had a pretty important trip come up. I had to say, 'You know, you said you were going to do that.' So, sure enough, he followed through."" So yes, Melinda Gates prompts Bill to ""lean in"" when it comes to parenting duties. Bill in turn honors her career triumphs with the family, including her being named by Forbes the third most powerful woman in the world. ""We don't show the kids all the press because they don't need to know everything that Bill and I are doing. But at the dinner table, Bill actually brought it up and the kids said, 'Wow, mom that's really fantastic!'"" ""Our youngest daughter who's 10 said to me later that night, 'You know mom, you should tell us more about what you do.'"" And she does, especially as the Gates prepare for their children to make their own way in the world. Bill Gates has famously said he would leave only a fraction of his fortune to his heirs. Earlier this year on Reddit, he said, ""I definitely think leaving kids massive amounts of money is not a favor to them."" Melinda couldn't agree more. ""We both feel like we benefited enormously from feeling like we had jobs, we had income, we were watching how we were spending our money. I want my kids to have that opportunity. ""So that's another reason why it's important for me to be a role model, particularly for my girls to see what it's like to be a woman and do that juggle between work life and family life."" So she works to inform and inspire her own children. She works to bring her partner on side to share the responsibilities and joys of raising a family. And she works to extend access to lifesaving medicine, quality education and modern contraceptives to hundreds of millions of people around the world. For the female force that is Melinda Gates, that's all in a day's work.","Gates is co-founder of the multi-billion dollar philanthropic foundation she runs with her husband .

"(CNN) -- It worked in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Now, taking their cue from social-media fueled uprisings in places like Egypt and Iran, a band of online activists hopes it will work on Wall Street. Kalle Lasn, co-founder of the counterculture magazine AdBusters, has taken to Twitter and other websites to help organize a campaign encouraging tens of thousands of Americans to hold a nonviolent sit-in Saturday in Lower Manhattan, the heart of the U.S. financial district. This past spring and summer saw a massive groundswell of populist demonstrations against authoritarian regimes in North Africa and the Middle East -- the Arab Spring of 2011. In Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain and Syria, protesters took to the streets and occupied public spaces to protest stagnant economies, lack of freedom of expression and regimes that seemed more concerned with consolidating power than addressing the needs of the people. Each of these revolutions began differently, but they all were organized and fueled by tech-savvy social media users, particularly on Facebook and Twitter. Lasn now wants to use the Internet for a protest in the United States. ""There's a very visceral anger against the financial community,"" Lasn said. ""Many people feel that these people who are financial fraudsters, who basically got away with it, have yet to be brought to justice... It seems like we the people now have to congregate on Wall Street and other financial districts around the world and force the global economic system to move in a better, more just direction."" Adbusters' protest campaign -- with the hashtag #occupywallstreet -- began in July with the launch of a simple campaign website calling for a march through the streets of Lower Manhattan and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange, just as demonstrators did in Tunis' November 7 Square and Cairo's Tahrir Square. The campaign got a sizable boost in August from the hacktivist group Anonymous, which released a short video urging its supporters to participate in the sit-in. Since then, the movement has seen the addition of planned protests in other countries, including Japan, Israel, Canada and a half-dozen European nations. The aim of #occupywallstreet is to draw 20,000 protestors to New York's financial district, although Lasn hopes for as many as 90,000. ""In Tunisia and in Egypt, the Internet was used to organize surprising numbers of people to get out into the streets and start a radical, democratic movement for regime change,"" Lasn said. ""Of course, the situation here in America and many European countries is quite different. We're not living under a torturous dictatorship, for one. ""Nonetheless, there's a feeling that the global financial system, the heart of which is in the U.S., in New York, that this system is somehow having its way with us,"" he said. ""There's a feeling that we need a revolution in the way that our economy is run, the way that Washington is run."" This isn't, Lasn stresses, an excuse for rioting and looting like the world recently witnessed in the United Kingdom. It's a call for radical change, but in the tradition of nonviolent protesters like Mahatma Gandhi, he says. If protests turn violent, he fears the message will be lost. ""What we are hoping for is to have a very large number of people turn up in Lower Manhattan and start walking toward Wall Street peacefully, signs in hand,"" Lasn said. ""If we have peaceful assemblies and debates about what our demands to President Obama should be, then bit by bit we can create a situation that will rival what happened in Egypt."" ""That would be a wonderful, energizing and positive moment to feel like we the people are in charge,"" he said.","Internet activists have taken to Twitter, other sites to ""Occupy Wall Street"" on Saturday .

"Washington (CNN) -- The looming decision on Syria is likely to preoccupy Congress for the next couple of weeks and complicate President Barack Obama's domestic agenda. Obama's push for military intervention against Bashar al-Assad's regime over alleged chemical weapons use could push aside his top priorities on immigration and health care. Because he decided to seek congressional approval and now faces strident opposition from many lawmakers and the public to his idea, Obama is having to go all-in in his sales job. His vigorous public relations campaign is all-consuming -- precious time that could have been used guiding an immigration bill through the House and informing the public about a new program to obtain health insurance under Obamacare. Need vs. want . In the world of need and want, though, immigration falls under the ""want"" category. The House scheduled only nine days of work this month. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said a vote on the Syria resolution might not come until next week, the second and last week the House is in session this month. What about October or November? Good question. The House has other pressing matters to address -- issues that have deadlines. The new fiscal year begins October 1 and that's wrapped up in a whole host of difficult topics, including the forced federal budget cuts that went into effect this year (and will have an even greater impact on defense and domestic programs next year). If Syria takes up a good portion of the House's work period in September and it doesn't get to work on government spending, two things could happen: The government shuts down or Congress could pass a short-term spending bill to keep it running for a limited amount of time. House Speaker John Boehner has indicated he will propose a spending bill to keep the government open until December, pushing the contentious but mandatory debate to later this year. Government funding is not the only complication to immigration. The nation's debt limit -- or its ability to borrow money to pay its bills --- will need to be raised by Congress sometime in ""mid-October,"" according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. He said that's when the United States will hit its $16.7 trillion borrowing limit and be unable to meet its credit obligations. Both raising the debt limit and passing mandatory government spending bills are common duties of Congress that have been fraught with crippling partisanship in recent years. Republicans have indicated this time will be no different. They plan to force the president's hand on either one or both issues to force additional spending cuts or defund the president's health care law. In other words, in addition to Syria, two complicated, political and mandatory issues are going to take far greater precedent over immigration -- an item on the president's wish list. The immigration bill could be ""dealt a pretty serious blow,"" congressional scholar Norman Ornstein with the American Enterprise Institute said. A crowded megaphone . Now that he has to sell a war-weary public about an intervention in Syria, his rollout of a massive public relations campaign on Obamacare could suffer. The success of public outreach on health care is vital for the law to work. As people can start signing up for the health insurance program on October 1, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one-third of the country, and 43% of the uninsured have heard ""nothing at all"" about the public health care option. If people don't know about it, people won't sign up for the public exchanges. A detrimental factor for the law as participation is critical for viability of the law. Obama announced that he will address the nation on Syria on Tuesday night. Also on Tuesday, the president is personally lobbying members of Congress on Capitol Hill on the resolution to authorize a limited military strike. While the president turns his full attention to Syria and the vote in Congress, previously scheduled items are falling by the wayside. Obama canceled a speech to the annual AFL-CIO conference in California, an opportunity to discuss domestic issues, including health care. The president's complete focus on Syria not only means he will have fewer opportunities to talk to the public about domestic priorities, but the media is focused on the drama building in Congress, too, drowning out any coverage of health care. A cursory search for news stories on the health care law shows a paltry 50 articles. (That's bad news for the president because the articles contained good news for the health care law. A report found that premiums for the government-sponsored exchanges would be much more affordable than expected.) Comparatively, a simple Internet search for news articles on Syria resulted in more than 2,000 news stories. ""There's only a certain amount of bandwidth of issues that can be discussed on TV or voters will be talking about,"" Ornstein said. Republican agenda at risk, too . While the president's fall agenda is at risk, the Republican agenda might suffer, too. Some of the most conservative members of Congress hoped to throw a massive wrench in the gears of Obamacare as they began to turn by attempting to defund the program. Senators Rand Paul, R-Kentucky and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, are among those taking part in a Tea Party Patriots rally to defund the program Tuesday in Washington. With Congress in its first week back from vacation and the agenda topped by Syria, it's likely to get little attention -- or the message could morph into an anti-Syria rally. Congressional scholar Thomas Mann with the Brookings Institution said there could be a ""silver lining"" to Syria crowding out immigration and health care. He said the seriousness of the issue could make it more difficult for lawmakers to ""engage in this kind of brinksmanship.""","Prospects for House to take up immigration reform this fall in jeopardy .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- President Barack Obama tried Thursday to invigorate the stalled Middle East peace process, urging young Israelis to pressure their leaders to seek peace with Palestinians while acknowledging the Jewish state's historical right to exist and defend itself from continuing threats. In a speech in Jerusalem that Obama had said would lay out his vision for the region, the president urged Israelis to look at the world through the eyes of Palestinians but also said enemies of Israel must change their rhetoric and tactics to reflect modern reality. ""You are not alone,"" Obama said in both English and Hebrew, prompting a standing ovation when he declared that ""those who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel's right to exist might as well reject the Earth beneath them and the sky above, because Israel is not going anywhere."" Hours before the speech on the second day of a Middle East swing, two rockets fired from Palestinian-controlled Gaza landed in southern Israel. They caused no injuries or major damage, but served as a symbolic welcome to Obama's visit to the West Bank on Thursday to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. A hardline group claimed responsibility. Israel honors Obama . In another symbolic moment, Obama received Israel's highest civilian honor -- the Presidential Medal of Distinction -- Thursday night from Israeli President Shimon Peres at a state dinner that emphasized the close ties between their countries. Noting the similarity between the histories of Israelis and African-Americans as former slaves who endured hardship before gaining freedom in a new land, Obama said, ""Our very existence, our presence here tonight, is a testament that all things are possible."" Opinion: Obama goes over Netanyahu's head to the Israeli people . The earlier talks with Abbas served as a counterbalance to Obama's meetings the previous day with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, setting up the Jerusalem speech that addressed crucial issues of the stalled peace process as well as regional concerns such as the civil war in neighboring Syria and Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. When Obama mentioned the name of Abbas in his speech Thursday, some boos erupted in the Jerusalem Convention Center among the audience of mostly young Israelis. He also was interrupted at one point by a protester's shouts, causing the president to joke that the heckling ""made me feel at home"" in reference to the caustic political climate in Washington. Obama acknowledged the difficulty in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian impasse, but insisted that ""peace is possible"" and called on young Israelis to make it happen. ""Political leaders will not take risks if the people do not demand that they do,"" Obama said to applause, adding a familiar theme from his U.S. campaign speeches in declaring ""you must create the change that you want to see."" Such a direct appeal to young Israelis was a ""bold and courageous"" move by Obama, according to Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel who now is vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Noting that the president lowered expectations before his trip of what he could accomplish, Indyk told CNN that Obama now raised expectations ""sky high"" that he was going to personally work to make peace possible. Kerry staying for more talks . Recently appointed Secretary of State John Kerry, who accompanied Obama on the trip that ends Friday in Jordan, will stay on to hold more talks with Israeli leaders, a senior administration official told reporters in a background briefing. ""We've done a lot of talking, a lot of listening over the course of the last two days, we'll do some more tomorrow, and then I think it'll be appropriate for Secretary Kerry to discuss next steps when he returns here,"" the official said. Obama said in his speech that he believes ""the Israeli people do want peace, and you have every right to be skeptical that it can be achieved,"" arguing that an end to the seemingly endless conflict is necessary and ""the only path to true security"" for Israel. ""Given the demographics west of the Jordan River, the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine,"" Obama said. ""Given the frustration in the international community, Israel must reverse an undertow of isolation. And given the march of technology, the only way to truly protect the Israeli people is through the absence of war -- because no wall is high enough, and no Iron Dome is strong enough, to stop every enemy from inflicting harm. "" On Israel trip, differences come into focus . At the same time, he urged Israelis to empathize with the plight of Palestinians, using direct and harsh imagery to make his point. ""Put yourself in their shoes -- look at the world through their eyes,"" he said. ""It is not fair that a Palestinian child cannot grow up in a state of her own, and lives with the presence of a foreign army that controls the movements of her parents every single day. It is not just when settler violence against Palestinians goes unpunished. It is not right to prevent Palestinians from farming their lands; to restrict a student's ability to move around the West Bank; or to displace Palestinian families from their home."" He added that ""neither occupation nor expulsion is the answer,"" saying, ""just as Israelis built a state in their homeland, Palestinians have a right to be a free people in their own land."" Arab states must seek normalized relations with Israel, and Palestinians must ""recognize that Israel will be a Jewish state, and that Israelis have the right to insist upon their security,"" Obama also said. Obama: Israeli settlements 'counterproductive' He prompted applause from the young Israeli crowd when he criticized their government's controversial policy of building new settlements in disputed territories. ""Israelis must recognize that continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace, and that an independent Palestine must be viable -- that real borders will have to be drawn,"" Obama said. On a personal note, the president told how he met with young Palestinians before his speech and they differed little from his own daughters, adding that he believed Israeli parents would want Palestinian youths to succeed if they had a chance to talk to them. During his earlier visit to to Ramallah in the West Bank, Obama stressed the need for direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians for a two-state solution. Palestinians see Israeli 'growth' as roadblock . ""The Palestinian people deserve an end to occupation and the daily indignities that come with it,"" he said at a news conference with Abbas, adding that Palestinians deserve ""a future of hope"" and a ""state of their own."" Obama said he and Abbas discussed, among other things, the Israeli settlements and the issue of Palestinian prisoners. He called for shunning the old habits, arguments and formulas that have stymied the peace process and envisioned ""two nations, two neighbors at peace, Israel and Palestine."" At the news conference and in his later speech, Obama said the foundation for a peace agreement exists if both sides can overcome internal and external obstacles and pressure, and can join together making the leap. The core issues right now, Obama said, are achieving sovereignty for Palestinians and security for Israel. ""That's not to say settlements are not important,"" he told reporters. ""It is to say that if we solve those two problems, the settlement problem will be solved. So I don't want to put the cart before the horse. I want to make sure that we are getting to the core issues and the substance."" During a news conference on Wednesday with Netanyahu, neither leader mentioned the settlements, showing the sensitivity of the issue for the conservative prime minister who just formed a new coalition government after a narrow election victory. In Ramallah on Thursday, Obama praised the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas but said Hamas, which governs Gaza, ""has the responsibility to prevent"" violations of a cease-fire with Israel such as the two rockets fired in the morning. Abbas: Peace 'is necessary' Abbas, however, said the Israeli settlements are ""more than a hurdle to peace,"" calling them illegal and saying it was Israel's duty to stop building them. At the same time, Abbas said Palestinians believe peace ""is necessary and inevitable,"" and it should not be made through violence, occupation, walls, denial of refugee rights or settlements -- reciting a list of Palestinian grievances against Israel. He envisioned a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders with Jerusalem as capital -- a scenario unacceptable to Israel. On Wednesday, Obama and Netanyahu offered a ""good cop-bad cop"" approach to Iran's nuclear ambitions. Both countries have accused Iran of secretly working toward building a nuclear weapon, and Netanyahu made it clear Wednesday after his talks with Obama that he believes the president is equally committed to preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. 5 things to know about Obama's first presidential visit to Israel . In comments to reporters Wednesday and in Thursday's speech, Obama called for more diplomacy on Iran while endorsing Israel's right to defend itself as it sees fit. He also insisted that ""all options"" remain open -- code for a military strike to disable the Iranian program. That prompted a warning Thursday from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, that Tehran would destroy Tel Aviv if Israel were to attack its nuclear facilities. Obama also warned the Syrian government that using chemical weapons against opposition forces or allowing such weapons to be obtained by terrorists would be a ""game-changer"" in terms of U.S. involvement in the conflict. His administration has been criticized for not providing military aid to the Syrian opposition. On Wednesday, Obama sought to assure Netanyahu and Israelis of his commitment to their security and to strengthen what have been strained personal and working relationships between the two men. In what Netanyahu called a key development, the leaders announced new talks on extending U.S. military assistance to Israel for another 10 years past the current agreement, which expires in 2017.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When it comes to priorities, many polls suggest Americans want President-elect Barack Obama to fix the economy first when he enters the Oval Office in a little more than two months. A poster this week in Los Angeles, California, depicts President-elect Barack Obama as Superman. Getting Congress to approve tax cuts promised on the campaign trail may be a good start toward tackling the problem, analysts say. If that goes well, experts say, the political momentum will help make it easier for Obama to keep his other campaign promises on alternative energy and getting health care for millions. ""In Washington, winning leads to winning, and losing breeds losing,"" said Stuart Rothenberg of the nonpartisan The Rothenberg Political Report. However, setting priorities often means navigating treacherous waters.  Watch the challenges facing Obama » .

"(CNN) -- At least six people were killed Thursday when a powerful earthquake struck off the coast of Honduras, President Jose Manuel Zelaya told CNN en Español Thursday. Thursday's quake leaves part of a bridge damaged over the Ulua River in El Progreso, Honduras. Another 17 people were injured, said Jose Reyes, a spokesman for COPECO, the Honduran government agency that responds to natural disasters. Two of the victims -- a 15-year-old boy and a 2-year-old girl from Morazan -- died after a wall collapsed on them, Reyes said, adding that trauma was blamed for most of the fatalities. A 9-year-old boy died, and a heart attack proved fatal to a man from Tela, Honduras, the agency said. A woman suffered cardiac arrest. The 15-year-old boy's brother suffered minor injuries, said Dilcia Fernandez, mayor of La Lima, where the boy died. La Lima is about 120 miles (200 km) north of the capital, Tegucigalpa. Eighty homes were destroyed and another 175 damaged, including 16 schools, nine churches, eight public buildings, seven factories, three bridges, two hotels, a hospital, an airport and a potable water system, Reyes said.  Watch how the quake damaged a bridge » . The 7.1-magnitude quake, which struck at 3:24 a.m. and was centered about 200 miles (320 km) north of the capital, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Half an hour later, a 4.8-magnitude aftershock hit about 155 miles (250 km) north of Tegucigalpa. Zelaya said the June 2-3 meeting of the Organization of American States will be held as planned in nearby San Pedro Sula, where he said one building had been damaged by the quake. The earthquake was centered, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, 27 miles (43 km) from Roatan, the largest of Honduras' Bay Islands and a popular destination for scuba diving and snorkeling. The area -- known for its white-sand beaches, clear waters and rich ocean reef -- is popular among budget-conscious travelers. ""People were startled. They started walking, running, doing everything they could to get to higher ground about two miles away,"" said Ron Cummins, who owns a resort there. ""I have been on the island for 14 years, this is the worst I have seen.""iReport.com: Did you feel the quake? Share photos, video . Ressie Bodden Saphrey said she was sleeping when her house started shaking. ""There was dark everywhere,"" said Saphrey, who works at a hotel in Roatan. Dishes and bottles crashed to the floor, she said. She and her 19-year-old daughter packed their passports, medicine, bottled water, canned food and a flashlight in case they were told to evacuate. They stayed inside their concrete three-story house, though many people in Roatan wandered the streets in the darkness, she said. A television station in Honduras, Channel 8, reported damage to several buildings. The Honduras disaster-response agency urged people to safeguard any important documents, and store food and water they could take in a hurry, according to Channel 8. Carol Frazier, who was vacationing in Roatan, said the quake knocked out power in her condominium and spilled water from the swimming pool. ""Everything was moving. The TV fell on the ground,"" she said. ""The difficulty was we couldn't even move. ""I really thought it was a tsunami or something. That was really our first concern,"" she said. ""We ran out."" Ron Bobbette, who manages a hotel in West End Roatan, said power had been restored in most places and panic was subsiding. ""Everything is back to normal,"" Bobbette said.

"(CNN) -- Consumer Reports, self-promoted as the largest independent consumer-testing organization in the world, recently subjected Tesla's all-electric vehicle to its standard gamut of automotive tests. The results were nothing short of extraordinary, as the model came just one point short of acing the 50-test evaluation regimen. Its final score of 99 out of 100 meant the Model S ""performed better than any other car we've ever tested,"" said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at the publication (Lexus owners will correctly argue that the 2007 Lexus LS 460L also earned a score of 99 in a Consumer Reports comparison years ago). When the Consumer Reports results were released with the expected publicity and hype, many looked at the near-perfect score and extrapolated that the car was the best car ever made. The Tesla Model S is an extraordinary clean-sheet effort from a small American automaker, but I'd stop several yards short of considering it — or any automobile, for that matter — the world's best car. Tesla : Consumer Reports' best car ever tested . Without question, Tesla's combustion-free five-door is innovative and awe-inspiring. I understand how the team at Consumer Reports became enamored with its effortless acceleration; cavernous, whisper-quiet interior; and glass panel technology. In fact, in my own first drive review published last fall, I called an early production model the ""world's first practical, no-compromise, noncombustion automobile."" Yes, it is pioneering. Yet before anyone slaps a blue ribbon and a hearty best accolade on its sleek windshield, it is time for a reality check — the Model S is hardly one point away from flawless. Even after overlooking all the Model S' objective blemishes (the team over at CR mentioned its lack of certain high-end features, stereo issues and parasitic battery energy losses when parked), electric vehicles lack a national infrastructure of charging points, accessible cross-country range and remain cost prohibitive for most consumers. These are major hurdles, preventing tens of millions from even considering vehicles like the Model S. Don't feel sorry for just the electric crowd, either. The same hindrances are lodged at other alternative-energy vehicles, such as those powered by hydrogen and natural gas. Tesla's high-scoring 85 kwh Model S, arguably at the top of its pure-electric segment, is limited to a range of about 265 miles. Even though it may be plugged into any common 110-volt electrical outlet for a slow charge, high-speed electric vehicle charging stations have only sprung up in major population centers or along busy highway corridors, meaning a lack of foresight before heading down a less-traveled road may initiate a tow truck encounter. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are more than 5,800 electric charging stations in the United States, but just two public charging stations in North Dakota, and zero in Wyoming (Tesla plans to have a nationwide network of its so-called Supercharger stations within a couple of years). I don't need to remind anyone that gasoline for combustion vehicles is as readily available as pasteurized milk, and still less expensive. And to revisit the cost, according to a recent study by TrueCar, the average transaction price for a new passenger car was $30,812 in January of this year. The flagship Tesla model tested by Consumer Reports wore an $89,650 window sticker, nearly three times the national average. Test drive: DC to Boston in a Tesla Model S . A true best car wouldn't just need a bladder-busting range, readily available fuel or a price that would make it attainable by all. It would need to be every bit as adept in a Syracuse winter as it would be comfortable in a Phoenix summer. It would have to be safe in crash testing, smooth on the highway, maneuverable around town and compact enough to fit into a crowded city garage. Some would even ask for off-road and towing capabilities. You see where I am going? No car currently manufactured deserves the coveted best car trophy, and that includes Consumer Reports' 99-point Tesla Model S. Personal transportation needs are uniquely individual, based on occupation, regional location, household size, income and, of course, taste. Giving a vehicle a near-perfect score is acceptable — and there will undoubtedly be others just as impressive — but assuming that one vehicle trumps others and satisfies all equally is misguided and presumptuous. To those who consider the Model S the world's best car, I throw out this question: What's the world's best shoe? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Harley.","Consumer Reports said Tesla Model S performed better than any car they've tested .
Michael Harley: Without question, Tesla is an innovative and awe-inspiring electric car .
Harley: But Tesla has issues too, such as its high cost and dearth of charging stations ."
"(CNN) -- On newspaper racks Tuesday, 9/11 was markedly absent from the front pages of the New York Times and the New York Post. ""The pain, the outrage, the loss -- these never fade,"" wrote the Times public editor Margaret Sullivan. ""The amount of journalism, however, must."" On the 11th anniversary of a tragedy, some Americans arose not remembering. It was another day of making coffee, packing sandwiches for kids' lunches, dropping off the dry cleaning before work. Memorial ceremonies, too, were fewer and simpler than in the past. It is natural for time to heal. Natural, too, for people to want to move on. But there was one place where the tragedy was hard to miss -- on social media. Honoring a son's memory after 9/11 . Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus and Instagram did not exist 11 years ago. 9/11 did not transpire in social media real time as many news events today do. But memories of that horrific day were kept alive Tuesday via smartphone, tablets and computers. Social media was a way for people to express their emotions when there were fewer physical ways to do so, said Robin Carey, CEO of Social Media Today. Maybe you weren't going to the local remembrance and hear the bells toll at 8:46 a.m., the time American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the North Tower. But you could get out your phone and tweet what you remembered about that moment. ""There's a lot of trending now on Twitter which shows it's a lot more durable than the media would believe at this point,"" Carey said. Stars remember 9/11 on social media . Among trending topics Tuesday were WTC, 11S, Remember911, Iraq, New York City, R.I.P and Bush. ""If the public comments did not exist, then you would not have the same attention on 9/11,"" said Sanford Dickert, a social media technology expert. ""There are so many moments we have let go because in the mental consciousness of our society, sometimes we forget things,"" he said. ""Social media provides the opportunity to find those issues you are concerned about."" The New York Police Department memorialized fallen officers through a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #neverforget. Each tweet linked to a poignant Facebook page about an officer. It was the social media version of a reading of names. Some people tweeted about where they were when they first got news about the attacks. @mikestuchbery: ""This time 11 years ago I was working on a presentation for a uni English course. It never happened."" Facebook users posted photos of how Lower Manhattan looked with the Twin Towers and how it looked Tuesday morning. Others posted sayings such as ""Never Forget,"" and still others, their remembrances of people who perished that day. Even politicians took a break from the campaign to offer their remembrances on Twitter. President Barack Obama (@BarackObama) tweeted: ""As painful as this day is and always will be, it leaves us with the lesson that no act of terrorism can ever change what we stand for."" His rival, Mitt Romney (@MittRomney), posted: ""In remembrance, let us recall what the flag symbolizes & the many who have sacrificed so that we may fly it proudly."" Politics muted on 9/11 anniversary . There were Twitter and Facebook gasps at realizing it has already been 11 years and that some young soldiers fighting in Afghanistan were in second grade when the Twin Towers came crashing down. And expressions of patriotism. Former Marine Ray Graziano's Instagram photo was a collage of three images -- a New York skyline with the burning World Trade Center, an American flag tacked to the inside of a transport aircraft in Afghanistan and of himself with an Afghan soldier in front of an Afghan flag. ""It shows we are here to better their country, even when our lives are on the line,"" he said. ""That job was one of the worst jobs in the world, but we loved every second of it."" Jonathan Cofresi, who was born two months after the two planes flew into the World Trade Center towers, designed a T-shirt commemorating 9/11. His older brother posted a photo of Jonathan's work on Instagram. ""Throughout his elementary school years he was always informed and educated about 9/11,"" said the older brother, Luis Cofresi Jr. Jonathan, he said, wanted to go beyond wearing the red, white and blue colors the school suggested. Son's name missing from 9/11 memorial . iReporter snaps poignant photo at memorial wall . Brian Monahan, a sociology professor at Pennsylvania's Marywood University, said social media helps Americans remember 9/11 in an anniversary year that is not a milestone 10th, 20th or 25th. It also provides ways to remember events other than the structured process of scheduled memorials, said Monahan, who has studied coverage of 9/11. There was a proscribed way before of how to be solemn. The symbolism went through official channels. ""It was an informal process but it was structured,"" he said. Social media takes all the barriers away. The conversation about 9/11 is also different now on Twitter and Facebook, especially after the killing of Osama bin Laden, Monahan said. ""There was only one way to talk about 9/11 and that was tragedy,' Monahan said. ""But now it's about core American values."" ESPN reporter Darren Rovell's Tweet may have reflected a chunk of how Americans were feeling Tuesday. They had not forgotten. But 9/11 was 11 years ago and life does go on. Dan Rather: Media's balancing act with terrorism . ""This day will always serve as a reminder that life can be taken from you at any moment. Cherish every minute,"" Rovell tweeted. The next tweet, an hour later, was about tennis sensation Andy Murray's U.S. Open victory. CNN's Dorrine Mendoza contributed to this report.","Memorials are fewer and simpler than in the past .
But 9/11 topics trend on Twitter and Facebook, filled with photos and remembrances .
Social media gives people a way to express their emotions .
The NYPD even used Twitter and Facebook to remember their fallen ."
"(CNN) -- Arsenio Hall made history in the early '90s as the first national African-American late night TV talk show host. Aimed at a hip, young demographic, ""The Arsenio Hall Show"" was famous for its trademark ""woof woof"" audience chant and never-know-who-might-stop-by guest list. The show ran from 1989 to 1994 and boasted memorable moments, some of which have become a part of pop culture lore: Bill Clinton playing the saxophone during the '92 campaign; Magic Johnson's first interview after being diagnosed with HIV; and Hall's tense show the night the Los Angeles riots broke out. On Monday, nearly 20 years after his original run, the 57-year-old entertainer heads back to TV with a new show, ""Arsenio."" Where has he been? How will he carve out his own niche in a very crowed late night field that includes Leno, Fallon, Letterman, Kimmel and Stewart? To paraphrase a certain someone, ""These are the things that make us go 'hmm.'"" CNN caught up with Hall at Hollywood's Sunset Bronson Studios on the set of the new show and got the inside scoop on his big return. CNN: What have you been up to since we last saw you on late-night TV? Arsenio Hall: I have been working hard in just a different element of life, trying to balance my own and do some things that are beyond show business and beyond rooms and (studio) lots like this. I left this business for something I didn't even know I was seeking. I just knew it wasn't in my schedule from sun up to sun down in Hollywood. I left the show for probably balancing my life -- I wanted my relationships to be different. I wanted to be with my family and my woman. It was a point where I felt I don't want to leave this earth without a kid. There were a lot of things going on... I want to do all those things that I wish my dad could have done with me. My mom and my dad worked very hard when I was young; I was a latch-key kid. I not only wanted to have a kid; I wanted to do it a certain way. Once more, with feeling: Where are the women in late-night TV? CNN: How will your new show be different from your late-night competitors? Hall: The good thing about the second time around, there are people who know me, and those 35-year-olds can tell their children, but I'm about to jump back into the culture and I'm the same Arsenio and I just give a different persona to a late-night talk show. Some will love it, some will hate it. But you look for people to choose you because of the questions you ask, because of the bookings you have, because of the comedy you do ... You're choosing what you want people to do with your public figures, your celebrities, your pop and hop stars. And everybody kind of knows what I do and how I do it, and I hope some people will join me for some nights. CNN: Who's on your wish list for guests? Hall: First of all, it's been very complicated booking the first show because I had to decide what I wanted it to be. On that show, I just want a fun return, a party. I just want laughter. No clips, no agendas, just friends and fun. And then the second night on, I'll start to decide whether I need to talk to Chris Brown and whether I can have that kind of interview. One of my dream guests, one of my dream shows, I don't have to do this, it's been done. When I was home, it was these kinds of things that drove me crazy and made me tell my son, is it time for daddy to go back to work yet, every week? I was watching Letterman, and he took his whole show on the roof of the Ed Sullivan Theater with Eminem and Jay-Z. Is that a show? Lord have mercy, that's the kind of TV I like. CNN: Will President Obama be stopping by? Hall: I don't want to be arrogant, so I'll give you the right answer. I will invite him, but he's done a lot in late night. I gotta get real creative to figure out what to do. He's slow-jammed the news, his wife's done the 'Dougie.' Maybe I'll go back to basics, maybe I just do a straight interview. But the bottom line, yeah, he'll be invited. CNN: Any other dream guests? Hall: I called (Bill Clinton) and I said, don't get nervous, I'm not asking a favor from you. But would your wife come out with a saxophone? That would be a move. If I walk out and then say, ooh one minute, grab a hand, and it's Hillary with a saxophone, it's on. Because that's also a special statement if she don't say nothing ... You know Hillary ain't gonna walk out with no saxophone. She might, but I said Bill Clinton wouldn't put on my sunglasses and play an Elvis tune and wear my tie and bring his wife and let her join him, and he said yes to all of that. So sometimes I've learned, ask. CNN: On your old show, you weren't afraid to tear up the script and get serious when the news of the day was serious -- for instance, the night the 1992 L.A. riots broke out. Will that be the case on the new show? Hall: I'm a stand-up comic doing a late-night talk show. But what I like to do in moments like that is bring in a person like Stevie Wonder as the musical guest, and you let Stevie do a number, but you know when we put Stevie on the couch, he'll give us a respectable response to that kind of situation ... I'm sure people, they want to be put to bed with a smile, but they also want me to touch on things that are going on. I'm not bright enough to handle it but there are plenty of guests who can. CNN: You've been off the air for nearly 20 years. How do you introduce yourself to a young audience that's never seen the original show? Hall: After I knew I was coming back and Tribune and CBS syndication had said yes it's a go, I immediately started going on everything. I even wrote an article for Newsweek on fatherhood. I went on Tosh, I went on Chelsea (Handler), I went on Leno about 47 times, I went on Bill Maher's HBO show and did a segment on the 20th anniversary of the riots by the way. I tried to get my face out there and doing everything. When (Access Hollywood host) Billy Bush would take a vacation, I would call (Access Hollywood host) Kit Hoover and say y'all mind if I sit in for Billy? And I'll call Billy and say, if y'all cool with it. I was doing everything I could to get my face out and to show this town that I'm still a viable talking head in late night. CNN: Why come back now? Hall: It starts with your 13-year-old asking you to drop him off about five blocks from the movie theaters or the party he's going to. There's a certain point where you realize you can moonwalk away from fatherhood just a little bit. And I sat down and had a conversation with him. Because part of raising a kid -- to be a man, you have to see a man -- and part of raising a kid is to show him the other side of it too. I love fatherhood. I really love being a dad. But like last night, I fell asleep before he did with the remote in my hand. That's what a young man needs to see too. Hard work, tired.","Arsenio Hall will return with a new show on Monday .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday night's ""Larry King Live,"" guest host Joy Behar talked about whether the Rihanna/Chris Brown case sends a dangerous message. Robin Givens told Joy Behar Tuesday night that details of domestic abuse are often the same. Among her guests were Robin Givens and Denise Brown. In an emotional interview, Behar examines how domestic abuse starts and why it's hard to stop. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Guest host Joy Behar: In a ""Larry King Live"" exclusive, Robin Givens and Denise Brown sound the warning to one quarter of all women who will be kicked, punched, raped, even killed by partners in their life times. ... We're talking about Rihanna and Chris Brown and the allegations against him. As you've just heard, the numbers are pretty appalling. Joining me now is someone who lived it: actress, ex-wife of former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson and spokesperson for the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Robin Givens. Greetings. Robin Givens: Greetings. Behar: Does this Rihanna/Chris Brown [story] bring up bad memories for you? Givens: Yes, it does. Behar: Tell me how you've been feeling lately while you're watching this on television? Givens: Even sitting now, you know, here with you, it shakes you up. You know, you begin to sweat. You begin to feel sad all over.  ... It's hard to sit here.  Watch Givens describe living with abuse » . Behar. You were saying to me before that it's always the same story. What do you mean by that? Givens:  I've spoken to women every[where]. ...  Peoria, El Paso. ... And what's amazing is that I find that my story is their story; their story is my story -- down to the details. He dragged me down the hall by my hair. He pulled me out of bed by my panties. He would like to choke me. He would kick. When I wrote my book, I was somewhere talking about something. And a woman came up to me and she said I wanted you to stop talking because I felt like everybody would know that you were talking about me. Behar: Oh, boy. And it's the same progression, too, it seems? Givens: I was hit for the first time before I was married. And I did what you thought you should do, of course. You know, you don't take any phone calls. Three days, absolutely not. Absolutely not. All of a sudden, you start taking a phone calls. Behar: Softening up. Givens: Yes. And then all of a sudden, OK, let's meet and we'll talk. And then you meet and all of a sudden this person, this man that you love, that's claiming his love for you, is crying, you know? And then you're consoling them. And it just becomes, I'll never, ever, ever do it again. ...  I just love you so much. It's so hard for me to handle how much I love you. And it just begins. Behar: It must have touched you a little bit, too, like here's this big heavyweight champion crying ... Givens: Yes. ... To see a man crying like that and promising and professing his love, I thought well, he must love me. ... Behar: In the fall of that year, you and Mike sat down with Barbara Walters to talk about the relationship. Here's an excerpt: . Barbara Walters, host: What's it been like, this roller coaster? Givens: It's been torture. It's been pure hell. It's been worse than anything I could possibly imagine. ... He shakes. He pushes. He swings. Sometimes I think he's trying to scare me. Behar: That is a most interesting moment  in that interview, which I've seen many times. What was going on in your head during that interview? Givens: Well, I was so numb. Barbara knew what was going on in our lives and encouraged me to be honest. I wanted to be honest and thought it would help other people. ... Behar: By the way, he [Tyson] was never convicted of anything? Givens: No. ...  It's interesting, though. He had done an interview somewhere. ...  I don't know specifically, but [he said] the best punch he ever threw was against me and that he punched me in the head and I bounced from one wall to the other. Behar: After the interview [with Walters], though, you stayed with him. Givens: Yes. Behar: Why did you stay with him? Givens: Well, he had said that he was going to get help. And I loved him. I wanted to make it work. I was very bonded. And it's hard to be bonded and save yourself at the same time. Behar: One of the most influential women in the world used her considerable power to speak up about domestic abuse. Here's what Oprah Winfrey had to say. Winfrey: Heal yourself first. And, also, love doesn't hurt. I've been saying this to women for years, love doesn't hurt. ... And if a man hits you once, he will hit you again. ... He will hit you again.

We all know Nicole Brown Simpson, O.J. Simpson's former wife. Greetings, Denise. How are you? Denise Brown: I am doing great. And I'm listening to all this information that you guys are talking about and it's amazing. It's so great to get out there. You talk about the dirty little secret. And it is. It's just that -- a dirty little secret. And then you're talking about what Oprah said -- if they hit you once, they'll hit you again. You can even go one step further, Joy, and you can say if they hit you once, they'll hit you again. And if they ever threaten to kill you, eventually one day they will. ... You know, it's the cycle of domestic violence, which is about the power and control of one human being over another -- the verbal, the emotional, the psychological abuse, you know, the chipping away at one's self-esteem. I'm sure you heard it, Robin: you know, nobody is going to want you. I'm the best thing for you. Givens: Um-hmm. Brown: And then that escalates into the physical violence, which is the hitting, the kicking, the punching, throwing up against the walls. And then, of course, [comes] the honeymoon phase. And that's the 'oh, baby, I'm so sorry. It's never going to happen again.' Givens: She's absolutely right. The woman -- every woman tells the same  story. Behar: If you read the Internet now, there's some hostility toward Rihanna. They're saying she provoked Chris. What do you make of that? Givens: I don't know why that is. I mean I don't know why in our society that is, that we blame the victim. Brown: Battery treatment programs is what people need. I spoke to a gentleman, Dr. Donald Dutton. He wrote a book, ""The Batterer."" He said right now, it would take three years for people that are batterers to get that mindset to change. And I'm sure that's even more. And our society does not take it serious enough ... until, of course, there's a murder or there's a celebrity or something of that nature, which is really sad. Givens: The one thing I'd like to say to Rihanna, actually; as difficult as this all is, she does not have to answer to the media. She doesn't have to explain it. She has to take care of herself. Behar: Thank you all very much. Go to CNN.com/LarryKing if you have something to say about domestic abuse. If you need help, there are resources listed there for you. Don't wait.

"Bihar, India (CNN) -- In less than a week's time at two separate India schools, police said Friday, they believe that children have been poisoned by their school lunches. At least 23 students in the southwestern coastal state of Goa were treated at a hospital after they got sick at lunch, authorities said. The students, in the third to fifth grades at St. Joseph School, have been released from treatment, Vishram Borkar, a police superintendent in Goa, told CNN. St. Joseph School is a government-aided private institution, he said. ""We have registered a case of food poisoning,"" he told CNN, ""and our investigation is on."" Earlier this week, 23 students died and 25 people were hospitalized from food poisoning after a school lunch in northern India's Bihar state. There were two cooks at the Bihar school, an official told CNN. Two children of one of them -- Panna Devi -- ate the toxic food and have died, medical superintendent Amarkant Jha Amar told CNN. Panna Devi is not receiving treatment because she didn't eat the toxic food, Amar said. She has a third child who ate the food and is improving at a hospital, the medical chief said. The other cook, Manju Devi, is also hospitalized, along with her three children, Amar added. Earlier, CNN-IBN had reported that two of Manju Devi's children had died. Bihar state is one of India's poorest. Experts have said the deaths shine a light on food safety in the country and have prompted discussion on how to improve national school food programs amid news that authorities warned of safety problems with Bihar's school meal program months ago. On Friday, authorities in Bihar announced that a new committee would be formed to strengthen food preparation in rural schools. The state's mid-day meal director, R. Lakshmanan, said village communities will also help monitor standards of meals for schoolchildren. Deaths cause protests . The Bihar students, who authorities said were between the ages of 5 and 12, started vomiting soon after their first bite of lunch. Some fainted. The parents of at least three children have buried their lost ones near the school -- one right in front of the building, according to CNN journalists who saw the burial mounds. An official told CNN that the parents did so out of protest. After the Bihar tragedy, demonstrations sprang up around the area as people angrily demanded answers. One news video showed men apparently attacking a school bus with sticks. Others gathered together and held signs. Students at nearby schools refused to eat. A group that supplies lunches to schools in the Chhapra district of Patna was attacked. It's unclear whether the children were intentionally or accidentally poisoned. An investigation is under way, and police told CNN that investigators have been unable to find the headmistress of the school in order to question her. Authorities were questioning the cook, also hospitalized in the tragedy. Agricultural chemical suspected . Officials believe the poison was an organophosphorus compound, a type of chemical that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is commonly used in agriculture. It's a nerve agent related to sarin gas, which is used in chemical warfare, the U.S. Health Department says. Exposure to a high dose can cause an irregular heartbeat, difficulty breathing, paralysis and seizures. Bihar state Education Minister P.K. Shahi said the children were poisoned by an insecticide that was in the food. Shahi said he heard reports that the cook had questioned the quality of the oil she was supposed to use, but was overruled by the school's headmistress. ""The information which has come to me indeed suggests that the headmistress was told by the cook that medium of cooking was not proper, and she suspected the quality of the oil,"" Shahi said. ""But the headmistress rebuked her, and chastised the children, and forced them to continue the meal."" According to the Indian government's figures, nearly half of India's children suffer from malnutrition of some sort. Since a landmark Supreme Court decision in 2001, all government schools in India have been required to provide free meals to students younger than 13. Bihar state has been working ""to improve the quality and ... try to get good food served,"" Shahi told CNN. ""However, the challenge is still there because the magnitude of this program is so huge that there are a number of challenges."" He said those challenges are at least partly financial. ""Even though I would unhesitatingly admit that there are some quality issues before us, this is the first incident which has happened in the state,"" Shahi said. ""In the past, we have received complaints regarding quality, but the incident of this nature ... has really shocked us -- shocked the entire state."" Mom anguishes over child poisoned by lunch: Why aren't you coming back? CNN's Harmeet Singh reported from India, and CNN's Ashley Fantz wrote in Atlanta.","23 students from a Goa state school treated for food poisoning, police say .

"(CNN) -- The recent, deadly chemical attack carried out, the administration says, by the Assad regime may finally prompt the U.S. military to help the Syrian people. But serious questions remain about our nation's moral standing in the world and the state of our national conscience. No matter how we act going forward, we are still left with the fact that we failed to intervene while more than 100,000 innocent Syrians were killed. One more genocide has come to pass. Does America have moral obligation to help those in need? As the world's most powerful nation, are we obliged to protect the innocent from slaughter? What example do we want to set for others, including future generations? For more than a year I have been dismayed to watch my country waver and delay in the face of the Syrian catastrophe that has resulted in so many deaths and millions being displaced from their homes. President Obama has, no doubt, been restrained by the kind of public opinion I heard when I campaigned in 2010 for the U.S. Senate. Then, as now, a majority of people feared getting involved abroad. They spoke warily of Iraq and Afghanistan and ask why we should risk more interventions when the costs were so high. A fear of ""foreign entanglements,"" to recall George Washington's farewell address, has always been part of the American character. But our heritage also includes a profound concern for human rights. And while our foreign endeavors have sometimes led us to regret, our inaction also haunts us. President Franklin Roosevelt failed to respond to the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany. Presidents Ford and Carter stood aside during Pol Pot's reign of terror in Cambodia. Bill Clinton has said he could have saved as many as 300,000 lives in Rwanda if he had acted to stop the killing there when he was president. He regards this inaction as the biggest policy regret of his presidency. Then there's eastern Congo. Millions of people have been killed there in the past few years. Yet no country, including the U.S., has done anything to stop the suffering. The world places its hopes in America as a country that stands for the rule of law against the rule of tyrants and for the elevation of right over might. We may not want the role of the world's policeman, but there are times when we have no choice. Indeed, if there is such a thing as American Exceptionalism, it is based on our willingness to act on the basis of our moral values and not just to secure our strategic and economic interests. At this moment, the public is displaying a level of apathy toward the Syrian tragedy that makes me fear that we have lost our moral compass. I understand that people are sick of wars and face many stresses in their own lives. Struggling with growing income disparity or unemployment, probably the last thing we need is to go into another war. But we are still the richest and most capable nation on Earth. And as human beings we should feel moved by outrage when we see a man being beaten on the street, or thousands of people being put to death by the air they breathe. As Americans, we should not shirk from our responsibility to the persecuted or slaughtered just because they are half a world away, speak another language or practice a different religion. In my travels around the world, I often encounter the complaint that in the post-9/11 era, America seems disengaged from humanitarian concerns. In Iraq we spent trillions of dollars to fight in an oil rich country that never attacked us, on the pretense that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed weapons of mass destruction. In Syria we long failed to act to defend people who are actual victims of weapons of mass destruction. How many people are losing faith in America as a morally-based power that will use its might to stop mass murder by a tyrant? The values I acquired growing up as an American in the 20th century America called for standing up to the kinds of crimes Assad has perpetrated for nearly eighteen months. In that time, President Obama has drawn various lines, declared his impatience, but permitted Assad to commit atrocities. In the process he made it seem that the America of the 21st century is callous, disengaged, and unconcerned with the lives of those who do not live under its flag. For me, a Jewish-American, this season of Rosh Hashanah brings a call to reflect on the year that has passed and for resolve to make the coming year better. When I consider what has happened in Syria I feel ashamed of our country -- once again we have permitted a slaughter -- and I feel willing to risk unexpected consequences in the future, for the sake of doing the right thing now. Americans must embrace an anti-genocide policy, one that calls for quick and decisive action, as a matter of moral responsibility. To act otherwise will only bring us more regret. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Greene.","Jeff Greene: With over 100,000 Syrians killed, another genocide has come to pass .

"(CNN) -- Users spent just 3.3 minutes on Google+ in January compared to 7.5 hours for Facebook, according to a new comScore report. The gulf between usage on G+ and Facebook has always been large, but comScore's numbers show a downward trend for Google's fledgling social network. Users spent 4.8 minutes on the network in December and 5.1 minutes in November, the report said. The usage figures come after Google has trotted out some impressive stats outlining Google+'s growth. In a call with analysts last month, Google CEO Larry Page said Google+ had 90 million users compared to 40 million in October. Reps from Google could not be reached for comment on the report. In the past, Google has taken issue with third-party reports about Google+, noting that they don't track users who access the site remotely, among other factors. (ComScore doesn't include mobile users in its data, though it plans to soon.) Google is putting a huge amount of emphasis on Google+. Last April, Page told employees that 25% of their annual bonuses would be tied to the company's social strategy that year, which primarily involved the yet-to-be-announced Plus. The company also integrated Google+ results into searches in January, a program it calls ""Google Plus Your World."" Despite the latest report, though, there's some encouraging news for Google: Website-Monitoring crunched the numbers this month and found that Google+ is getting less male dominated and is catching on big in India, where 13.69% of Plussers now originate. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's war drums continue to beat, but an offhand comment from Secretary of State John Kerry has set in motion a diplomatic effort by Russia -- seized on at the United Nations -- to ward off a U.S. strike on Syria in favor of mediation. What Kerry said was that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could prevent a strike if he ""could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week."" Kerry added that Syria would not be willing to do this. Russia has latched on to the proposal, and Syria says it is taking the idea seriously. The view is that Kerry's comment is either an accidental out for a president hemmed in by his own red line, or a momentum-sucking goof that may have erased any chance Obama had to engage in a military strike without broader international approval. Will Russia's proposal delay an Obama strike? And how can Obama sway Americans to support military action? With his approval ratings on all fronts tanking, his prime-time televised address Tuesday night will be crucial. It'll be the administration's closing argument after a week of courting lawmakers. Here are five things to look for today. 1. What Obama says in his speech . The president will still make the case that Congress must authorize military force in Syria, a senior administration official told CNN. This, despite the fact that Obama believes Kerry's offhand offer for Syria to turn over its chemical weapons could bear fruit now that Russia and the United Nations have jumped aboard. The link between the two? The administration argues that the offer to turn over chemical weapons wouldn't be on the table if not for the threat of force. A senior administration official told CNN that Kerry's not in trouble with the president for the comment, but does admit that it was off the cuff while restating administration policy. Bottom line: It wasn't inconsistent with what was happening behind the scenes, according to the official. To make his case for a military strike, the president will lay out what happened in the chemical weapons attack in Syria on August 21, and why it's in America's interest to act. He'll argue that the United States can't let this kind of attack go unanswered, and he'll tell us how he sees it affecting the safety of U.S. troops. And perhaps the toughest one of all, he'll tell a nation weary from more than a decade of war why Syria isn't Iraq or Afghanistan. 2. Whether Russia's diplomatic volley has knocked the steam out of a strike . The White House isn't acting like it has. If anything, the lobbying on Capitol Hill is intensifying ahead of the president's address. It all starts with Obama, who will go to the Hill on Tuesday to make his case to Senate Democrats, a Senate leadership aide told CNN. Making sure to hit both sides of the aisle, the president also will attend the Senate GOP lunch, a Senate Republican aide said. The House Armed Services Committee hosts three of the administration's big guns beginning Tuesday morning: Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. All of them will get important face time with the influential committee. Although no longer a member of the administration, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will speak on Syria at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening, just ahead of the president's national address. 3. Whether the lobbying efforts pay off in votes . For the time being, the tide is against the White House. On Monday, six senators notched their votes in the ""no"" column, with just one, Democrat Barbara Mikulski, saying she would favor military intervention against Syria. In the House, chalk up 13 new ""no"" votes. That brings the total of ""no"" votes to 29 in the Senate and 161 in the House. Still, there are a lot of undecided members -- 46 in the Senate and at least 229 in the House. The numbers could still work out for the president. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid postponed a procedural vote that had been scheduled for Wednesday. The Senate's in no hurry to vote on Syria. 4. If Obama fares better in the court of public opinion . The president's approval rating on foreign policy is at an all-time low of 40%, a steady slide from 54% in January, according to a CNN/ORC International survey. Just three in 10 approve of how he's handling Syria. The public is split right down the middle on whether Obama is a strong leader, whether he is honest and trustworthy, and whether he inspires confidence. Then there's the whole ""war weariness"" issue in play. Six in 10 say the war in Iraq was a mistake, and 50% say the same thing about Afghanistan. Three-quarters say the United States doesn't need to be the ""world policeman."" Also hurting the president's cause, more than seven in 10 say a strike would not achieve significant goals for the United States, and a similar amount say it's not in the national interest for the country to get involved in Syria's civil war, a separate CNN/ORC International poll shows. The sentiments come despite survey results that show 80% of Americans believe al-Assad's regime gassed its own people. 5. How the international community reacts . The next move appears to be Russia's in this diplomatic chess match. Can Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov deliver on the offer to have Syria hand its chemical arsenal over to international control, or is it just an effort to buy time for the Assad regime? Lavrov said Tuesday that Russia's working on a ""workable, clear, specific plan"" that it'll present soon. The White House is willing to listen and, perhaps, wait a bit -- but not too long. ""It's certainly a positive development when the Russians and Syrians both make gestures towards dealing with these chemical weapons,"" Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday. But he said the threat of American force would remain. ""We don't want just a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on there right now."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is listening, too. He's considering asking the U.N. Security Council to demand the Syrian government immediately hand over its chemical weapons to be destroyed. France and Germany also say they like what they're hearing about a diplomatic solution. But, the French foreign minister said, the Security Council needs to oversee the process, which should start immediately, and the plan shouldn't let anyone off the hook for ordering a chemical attack. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Tuesday that France is proceeding with caution. ""We take note of this new position with interest but also precaution,"" he said. ""We do not want it to be used as a maneuver for diversion."" What the French want to see is for Syria to be transparent about its chemical weapons program and to put it under international control. France also wants the perpetrators of the deadly chemical weapons attack tried before the international justice system, Fabius said. Iran, a longtime Syria ally, welcomes the Russian initiative ""to stop militarism in the region."" China, also an ally of Syria, says it welcomes and supports the proposal. The opposition Free Syria Army says Russia's proposal is nothing more than a stalling tactic. ""Here we go again with the regime trying to buy more time in order to keep on the daily slaughter against our innocent civilians and to fool the world,"" said Louay al-Mokdad, a spokesman for the group. CNN's Dana Bash, Steve Brusk, Dan Merica, Paul Steinhauser, Zachary Wolf, Samira Said and Karla Crosswhite contributed to this report.","The president will still make the case that Congress must authorize military force .
The White House doesn't think Russia's diplomacy has made a strike impossible .

"Athens (CNN) -- The leader of Greece's center-right, pro-bailout New Democracy party claimed ""a victory for all Europe"" after topping Sunday's parliamentary elections, a vote seen as a referendum on the survival of the continent's common currency. New Democracy's Antonis Samaras now finds himself facing a new round of coalition talks, six weeks after a previous election that failed to produce a government. In a brief address following Sunday's vote, he pledged to form a slate ""determined to do what it takes and do it fast."" ""Today the Greek people expressed their will to stay anchored within the euro, remain an integral part of the eurozone, honor the country's commitments and foster growth. This is a victory for all Europe,"" Samaras said. ""I call on all parties that share those objectives to form a stable new government."" The unpopular bailouts that have kept Greece from defaulting on its debts in the face of an ongoing recession include budget cuts demanded by international lenders. Voters punished New Democracy and its former coalition partners in the socialist party Pasok in the earlier vote in May, but reopening the agreement would set up a confrontation with the other countries that use the euro -- the common currency of 325 million people across 17 European nations. Markets appeared poised to react positively to news of the vote, as Japanese stocks climbed. The Nikkei rose 1.7% in early trading Monday. With less than half of 1% of ballots still to be counted, New Democracy had won nearly 30% of the vote, according to Interior Ministry figures. But that showing translates to 129 seats in the country's 300-seat parliament, forcing it to seek other coalition members from the fragmented field. Samaras has said his party wants to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies, including stringent austerity measures, to ""achieve development and offer people relief."" His leading rival, Alexis Tsipras of the left-wing, anti-bailout Syriza, had called for the deal to be torn up. European Union leaders hailed the vote, with eurozone finance ministers praising results ""which should allow for the formation of a government that will carry the support of the electorate to bring Greece back on a path of sustainable growth."" And in a joint statement, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman van Rompuy said in a joint statement that they ""support the continued efforts of Greece to put its economy on a sustainable path."" ""Today, we salute the courage and resilience of the Greek citizens, fully aware of the sacrifices which are demanded from them to redress the Greek economy and build new, sustainable growth for the country,"" the EU leaders said. Tsipras congratulated New Democracy late Sunday, but said his party's nearly 27% showing has forced Greek leaders to realize the bailout ""is a nonviable economic plan."" Samaras ""has the opportunity to form a government on the basis of the people's verdict and on the basis of his own program,"" Tsipras said. But he said Syriza -- which was projected to win 71 seats -- would continue to demand ""from the position of the opposition"" that the bailouts be scrapped. ""Even if it didn't manage to take the first place, Syriza is now the most basic body representing the average individual, the progressive and the anti-memorandum portion of our population,"" Tsipras said. Both Syriza and New Democracy picked up 20 seats over their showings in the abortive May 6 vote, while Pasok fell from 41 seats to 33. In the previous parliament, elected in 2009, Pasok held 160 seats, New Democracy held 91 and Syriza, 13. What will Greek elections mean for the country's future? Critics had feared that efforts to renegotiate the bailout would set up a confrontation that could lead to a run on Greek banks and deeper misery. ""Don't underestimate the capacity of the Greek people to rise to the occasion,"" Petros Doukas, a former New Democracy lawmaker and deputy finance minister, told CNN. ""What's very clear is the Greeks today voted, including those that voted for Syriza, in favor of the euro and the European Union,"" Doukas said. He predicted that Greece could now come to better terms with its creditors, whom he said understand ""that you can only squeeze so much so fast out of a country and out of its people."" Pasok trailed in third place with about 12%. Its leader, Evangelos Venizelos, said the parties need to hammer out a ruling coalition overnight. Venizelos proposed an alliance of New Democracy, Pasok, the Democratic Left party -- which was running in sixth place with 6% and a projected 17 seats -- and Syriza, which has said it won't join a government that backs the continued bailout terms. ""If we really want Greece to remain in the euro and to get out of the crisis for the benefit of every Greek family, by tomorrow we need a government,"" he said. The Independent Greeks were running fourth at 7.5% and 20 seats, while the nationalist, far-right Golden Dawn -- which called illegal immigration the country's biggest issue -- appeared headed for a fifth-place finish at 7% and 18. The Communists brought up the rear at 4.5% and 12 seats, according to Interior Ministry figures. The Independent Greeks, a conservative nationalist party led by former New Democracy lawmaker Panos Kammenos, saw its support shrink from 33 seats in May to 20, while Golden Dawn -- which hadn't won seats in parliament before -- held steady. A wild election weekend for Greece, France and Egypt . Greece has been suffering under a heavy burden of painful austerity measures, high unemployment and a long-running recession. Syriza and New Democracy were effectively tied in the last official polls two weeks ago, in part because Syriza was seen as offering something new and different, Greek journalist Fanis Papathanasiou said Sunday. And Yiannis Alafouzos, managing director of Greek broadcaster Skai Media Group, said older Greeks are scared -- ""But the younger generation, they're not scared, and they seem to have had enough of the recession they're trying to get out of it by rebelling, effectively."" ""Unfortunately, the political system in Greece has not been honest with the voters,"" Alafouzos said. ""And so a lot of people believe there is a way out of this without all the pain we have been suffering for the past two or three years."" The possibility that Tspiras could emerge as prime minister prompted waves of fear that Greece could crash out of the euro and Europe's ambitious experiment with a common currency could collapse. Some analysts have estimated that the collapse of the euro would cost $1 trillion, while others say talk of the break-up of the currency is alarmist and unlikely to happen. Since May's vote, Greece has been roiled by uncertainty and division, and the country must identify additional budget cuts by the end of June to be considered ""compliant"" with the terms of its bailout program. The future of Europe: 3 scenarios . German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe's most powerful advocate of balancing budgets to build a strong basis for economic growth, urged Greeks not to walk away from international loan deals. ""We will stick to the agreements. That is the basis on which Europe will prosper,"" she said Saturday. But Fotis Kouvelis, leader of the small Democratic Left party and a potential kingmaker in a closely divided parliament, said the country needed to escape ""a situation that cuts us into small pieces and hurts society."" As economic crisis bites, Greece's children pay the price . The situation in Greece is likely to be on the minds of world leaders as they meet in Mexico on Monday for the Group of 20 summit. Some experts argue that a potential Greek exit would be manageable, assuming the European Central Bank and European Union policymakers respond aggressively, while others worry that the pullout would cause chaos in financial markets and shock the global economy.

"(CNN) -- A woman was found bound to a bed late Friday night in Philadelphia when police responded to a neighborhood dispute, police said. Around midnight, officers arrested Regina Bennett, 46, at her residence on Linton Street in connection with threats and assault against a neighbor in an ongoing dispute. As officers were leaving, neighbors told them that a small child may also have been living in Bennett's residence, Officer Tanya Little said. Initially, police saw no signs of a child living at the residence. But after conducting a full walk-through, they found a 36-year-old woman tied to a bed in ""unsuitable conditions,"" Little said. The woman was extremely thin, with apparent sores and injuries to her body. According to Little, she also seemed to have special needs and has a limited vocabulary. ""We went in there looking for a child, and then this is what we found,"" Little said. The woman was freed by officers and transported to Einstein Hospital, where she was being evaluated Sunday. Little said it appears to be a case of neglect, and police are unsure for how long the alleged abuse had been going on. Officers and medics are also investigating whether the woman had been sexually abused, she said. Bennett's relationship to the woman is still under investigation, Little said. According to Little, Bennett is being held at Philadelphia Police Headquarters. She is charged with terroristic threats, simple assault, public drunkenness, aggravated assault, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment and related offenses. It was unclear Sunday afternoon whether Bennett has an attorney.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Nobel Laureate and microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus faced a new government fight Monday as the Cabinet ordered ""legal action"" against him for what it called ""tax irregularities."" The Cabinet meeting, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, discussed a report prepared by the National Board of Revenue that claimed it had found tax irregularities by Yunus between 2004 and 2011, said cabinet secretary Mohammad Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan at a briefing. The allegations are related to his overseas earnings of about $ 6.4 million, including award money and royalties from his books, and possible improper tax exemptions. Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, however, denied the allegations in a news release issued by Yunus Center in Dhaka. It said the government was supposed to determine what earnings were taxable. ""Professor Yunus has done everything with the consent and approval of the governing body,"" it said. ""Professor Yunus had brought all his overseas earnings through banking channels as per laws and showed them in his income tax return and paid all the applicable taxes."" The National Board of Revenue chairman, Ghulam Hussain, said on Monday the board would seek an explanation from Yunus and take legal action if the explanation was found to be unsatisfactory. On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department urged the Bangladeshi government to treat Yunus ""in a fair and transparent manner, in keeping with Bangladeshi law and the principles of due process."" This is not the first time that Yunus and the government have been at odds. In 2011, Bangladesh's central bank removed Yunus as managing director of Grameen Bank, citing a mandatory retirement age. Yunus, 73, founded Grameen Bank three decades ago to reduce poverty in Bangladesh. The model of financing the extremely poor without requiring any collateral was replicated around the world. Yunus was also awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and a U.S. Congressional Gold Medal in April.","The Bangladeshi government accuses Muhammad Yunus of tax irregularities .

"(CNN) -- New York Fashion Week is set to bloom on Thursday, and fashion forecasters are once again peering into their chic crystal balls for an early glimpse of the spring 2014 women's collections. Sheila Aimette, of fashion forecaster WGSN, says fashion followers are in for a sweet surprise with candy-colored pastels. (WGSN is the official trend sponsor of the bi-annual Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.) Amidst garden party hues of blush rose and bold peony, Aimette also expects designers to add a vivid splash of blue -- from icy aqua to classic navy -- to liven up the softer hues. Fall trends at the top of the class . ""I suspect we will see a continuation of resort (wear) -- big florals, art-inspired prints, offbeat pastel combinations and architecturally minded separates and sportswear-inspired ideas,"" predicts Anne Slowey, fashion news director of Elle Magazine. Aimette agrees: Flora and fauna will be flourishing, even in mismatched patterns on top and bottoms. ""There will be a lot happening in print and pattern because the silhouette is architectural and sleek,"" Aimette says. See all of CNN Living's New York Fashion Week coverage . Denim will also be on double duty; expect to see the wardrobe staple in skinny-legged, dark washes, paired with a boyfriend-fit chambray shirt. Aimette says colored denim's appeal will fade, while basic indigo is back. When it comes to bottoms, there's no middle ground -- or hem. Expect pleated-kilt miniskirts or midcalf skirts. The former, an ode to The Met's spring 2013 Costume Institute exhibition, ""PUNK: Chaos to Couture,"" the latter inspired by the upcoming film ""Grace of Monaco,"" starring Nicole Kidman as Grace Kelly. Aimette says the asymmetric hem's allure will taper off, along with studded accessories. Photos: Punk fashion at the Met Gala . Let's not forget about the footwear, where black-and-white loafers, graphic printed flats and Lucite wedges step right up. As for designers to watch, Slowey says Dion Lee, Rosie Assoulin and Tome are three brands to keep eyes on for their sophisticated, clean lines, while NewbarK, the brainchild of sisters Maryam and Marjan Malakpour, will be any downtown gal's go-to for understated accessories. ""I'm really in love with the idea of anonymous luxury -- beautiful luxurious separates that resist being easily identified,"" Slowey said.

"(CNN) -- Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president 14 years ago, says the ailing revered statesmen will pull through. ""I know the doctors who are working with him are very good people, very good doctors and I am quite certain, I am quite certain that, one of these days, Madiba will go back home,"" Mbeki said over the weekend, calling Mandela by his clan name. Mandela, 94, is considered the founding father of South Africa's modern democracy. He has been hospitalized in Pretoria since June 8 for a recurring lung infection -- a legacy of his years of imprisonment under South Africa's now-defunct apartheid regime. Mbeki is the second president in South Africa's post-apartheid era ushered in by Mandela. Mbeki served from 1999 to 2008 after Mandela emerged from prison in 1990 and became the nation's first black president four years later. Jacob Zuma currently serves as president. ""What the government has been saying is that his condition is critical but stable is correct. But I think we need to add to that that indeed his health is improving. The medical care that he is receiving is in fact excellent and as I say, I am quite certain that one of these days the doctors will agree that he can go and stay at home rather than in hospital. Certainly that is our hope and our wish, but I think that is what will happen,"" Mbeki said. Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the South Africa's system of racial segregation. A court document released recently revealed that Mandela's health had declined so sharply on June 26 that his family was considering whether to take him off life support. The next day, however, Zuma announced that Mandela's condition improved from critical to critical but stable.","Thabo Mbeki says Nelson Mandela's ""health is improving""

"London, England (CNN) -- London's two major airports were closed Monday as a cloud of ash from a volcano in Iceland moved east into England, British air authorities said. All flights into and out of Heathrow and Gatwick airports have been canceled for a six-hour period beginning early Monday, airport officials said. The affected flights are those scheduled between 1 a.m. (8 p.m. Sunday ET) and 7 a.m. (2 a.m. ET). The Monday cancellations were the latest in a round of weekend closures of airports across the United Kingdom and into continental Europe. Amsterdam's Schipol Airport announced it would be closed Monday from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. (midnight Sunday to 8 a.m. ET), according to an airport spokeswoman, who said officials were waiting on guidance from air authorities to decide when flights will resume. Birmingham, Norwich Manchester and Liverpool airports were closed on Sunday evening, controllers announced. In addition, Dublin's airport closed overnight, the Irish Aviation Authority said Sunday, and will remain closed until at least 9 a.m. (4 a.m.) Monday. International flights through Irish airspace will not be affected, it said. Waterford airport was set to close at 11 p.m. (6 p.m.) and four other Irish airports remain closed. Shannon, Cork and Kerry airports are open. Flights were also stopped at all airports in Northern Ireland, as well as the British airports at Ronaldsway, Prestwick, Carlisle, Doncaster, Humberside, Leeds Bradford and East Midlands. Some Scottish island airports also shut down, including Campbeltown, Islay and Barra, the air traffic control agency NATS announced. And if the volcano continues to erupt at current levels and weather conditions prevail, air travel in Britain could be disrupted between Sunday and Tuesday. ""The government is carefully monitoring this situation and the safety of passengers will remain our paramount concern,"" said Philip Hammond, transport secretary. The department said predictions remain fluid, urging passengers to check with airlines before taking any action. British Airways said it would notify passengers of potential disruptions on its website. ""There is a distinct possibility of some disruption from the ash cloud over the southeast of England, but it is too early to tell if this will extend as far as Heathrow or Gatwick yet,"" a BA spokesman told CNN. Volcanic ash had forced the closing of Iceland's main airport Friday but it reopened at midnight and operated normally on Saturday. Earlier in the week, traffic was shut down in airports from central Spain to the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa. The problems began in mid-April, when the volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in southern Iceland erupted and sent a cloud of ash into the atmosphere, disrupting international travel for several days. There's no way to know how long the volcano will continue spewing ash into the air, Georgia Tech scientist Josef Dufek told CNN. ""It could go on another year,"" he said, noting that an eruption lasted that long in 1820. Volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail. British ministers agreed Saturday that five-day ash-prediction charts would now be made available to airlines, other transport providers and the public on the Met Office website. Previously, only 18-hour forecasts had been available. CNN's Caroline Paterson contributed to this report.","NEW: Amsterdam's Schipol Airport to close Monday from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.

"(CNN) -- Two months before her death, former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto sent an e-mail to her U.S. adviser and longtime friend, saying that if she were killed, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf would bear some of the blame. Bhutto was assassinated after the campaign rally, seen here, Thursday. She cited his government's denial of her request for additional security measures after the October suicide bombing that targeted her upon returning to Pakistan from exile. ""Nothing will, God willing happen,"" she wrote to Mark Siegel, her U.S. spokesman, lobbyist and friend. ""Just wanted u to know if it does in addition to the names in my letter to Musharaf of Oct 16nth, I wld hold Musharaf responsible. I have been made to feel insecure by his minions and there is no way what is happening in terms of stopping me from taking private cars or using tinted windows or giving jammers or four police mobiles to cover all sides cld happen without him."" Bhutto was seeking to become prime minister for a third time when she was assassinated; her death comes exactly two weeks before Pakistan's January 8 parliamentary elections.  Watch Siegel describe her concern and the reaction of Pakistan's U.S. ambassador » . Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S., Mahmud Ali Durrani, on Thursday insisted Musharraf's government provided the former prime minister with unprecedented security. He said that terrorists and extremists, who also have targeted Musharraf, were the only ones responsible for her death.  Watch a report on security provided to Bhutto » . Bhutto wrote the e-mail on October 26, eight days after at least 130 people were killed and hundreds more wounded in Karachi by the suicide bombing that occurred as Bhutto's motorcade passed. Siegel forwarded that e-mail to CNN's Wolf Blitzer, with instructions he not report on it unless Bhutto was killed. Just before returning to Pakistan after eight years of self-imposed exile, Bhutto told CNN she was aware of threats against her and said that some had come from people who hold ""high positions"" in Pakistan's government. She said she had written a letter to Musharraf about her fears, apparently the same letter she refers to in her e-mail to Siegel. In a speech, she listed four groups she believed posed the biggest threat to her and her cause -- the Taliban in Pakistan, the Taliban in Afghanistan, al Qaeda and a suicide team from Karachi that she did not describe. After the October bombing, she accused elements in the government and security services of trying to kill her and asked Musharraf for ""basic security,"" including vehicles with tinted windows and private guards in addition to police guards. Three United States senators repeated the request in a letter to Musharraf. Bhutto was concerned by the lack of security she had upon her arrival in Karachi and called the October 18 bombing ""very suspicious,"" Siegel said. He accused Pakistani authorities of not investigating the assassination attempt and of refusing Bhutto's request for Scotland Yard and the FBI to aid in the investigation. Bhutto and her husband had asked for jammers to impede the detonation of bombs; special vehicles with tinted windows; and four police vehicles to surround her at all times, Siegel said. ""She basically asked for all that was required for someone of the standing of a former prime minister,"" Siegel told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""All of that was denied to her. ... She got some police protection, but it was sporadic and erratic."" Bhutto was concerned the problem was worsening as the January elections neared, Siegel said. At the time of the October suicide bombing, Bhutto was riding in a truck from Karachi's airport to the tomb of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan. She had moved from the roof to inside the bulletproof, armed vehicle just moments before the blast and was unharmed. CNN's Dan Rivers, in Karachi to cover her return to Pakistan, remarked at the time that her security appeared to be loose, saying his crew was able to walk up to the side of her vehicle without being stopped by authorities. Durrani, Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S., insisted security surrounding Bhutto then was more than adequate. ""There were, I think, a sea of security people,"" he said. ""She was surrounded by police vehicles. And had it not been one of the police vehicles which took the blast in Karachi, unfortunately she would have died there. ""There was a bubble around her of security. The PPP [People's Party of Pakistan, Bhutto's party] insisted that they have their own private loyalists around. They were there too. And there were about 7,800 to 8,000 security people deployed just for that,"" Durrani said. ""That is more security than anybody deploys anywhere in the world."" ""She was moving almost in a sea of humanity,"" Durrani said. ""No system in the world can protect you against that."" Bhutto ""is not a security person,"" he said. ""She's a politician. I think the government of Pakistan provided her all the security that was necessary. You tell me -- the way she was hit, she would have been hit with tinted windows or without, or without the IED ... so it's just a blame game."" After the October attack, Bhutto said police offered to let her use a helicopter for the trip from the airport, but she told them she wanted to be near her people. She said she did not regret that decision. ""She believed in democracy, and she believed in speaking to the people,"" Siegel said. ""It's not reckless to go out and touch the people. Don't blame the victim for the crime. The person that was supposed to be protecting Benazir Bhutto and the other candidates was the government of Pakistan with the government of Pervez Musharraf."" Blitzer noted that Bhutto was shot Thursday while standing out of her vehicle's sunroof -- seen by some as a a reckless action after the October incident. Getty Images senior staff photographer John Moore, who was at the scene of her assassination, told CNN he was surprised at Bhutto's actions, considering the earlier suicide attempt. The rally was smaller than expected, he said, and the people he spoke with said they ""were just afraid to come out, for the simple reason that they all remembered what happened in Karachi."" Siegel grew emotional as he told Blitzer that Bhutto was ""the bravest person I ever knew. ... She knew that there were risks coming back, but those risks were important, she thought, for the fight for democracy.""

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel dashed Fernando Alonso's hopes of delivering a home victory for Ferrari at Monza with another commanding drive to win the Italian Grand Prix Sunday. The three-time defending champion secured his sixth win of the season after starting on pole position, relegating Spain's Alonso to second place. Vettel's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber finished third ahead of the second Ferrari of Brazilian Felipe Massa. The victory extended Vettel's advantage in the world title race over Alonso to 53 points with seven rounds remaining. Britain's Lewis Hamilton, who was forced to start from 12th after a poor qualifying session Saturday, could only manage ninth spot, but remained in third place in the standings, 81 points adrift. Vettel's only significant problem was self imposed as he flat spotted his front right tire after breaking too sharply into the first corner of the race. Under pressure from Massa, the 26-year-old German was desperate to hold on to his lead after the traditional flat out start at Monza. Two time champion Alonso, back in fifth on the grid after his difficulties in qualifying, quickly worked his way up to third before Massa gave way to him under team orders. Vettel was able to nurse his tires until the first and only round of pit stops for the leading contenders without coming under serious challenge. Alonso was briefly challenged by Webber until the Australian was ordered to back off because of gear selection problems, which were also problematic for the leader Vettel. But he took the checkered flag 5.4 seconds clear of Alonso to take an even firmer grip on the championship he has dominated for the past four seasons. Vettel was only too aware that his victory was unlikely to be welcomed by the tifosi diehards who had flocked to the circuit in northern Italy to support their beloved Ferrari. ""It was a fantastic race, but you can hear the difference when you don't win here in a red suit,"" Vettel said. ""But this means you have done well and beaten the red men! ""The race was terrific for both of us as we had problems with the gearboxes at the end, but I was ok because I had a good cushion. It is a fantastic win."" Alonso acknowledged there was little he could do to prevent the 32nd victory of Vettel's career. ""Second place is good and to have this podium ceremony which is the most spectacular podium of the year,"" he said. ""Hopefully we'll come back next year and have first place. Every time I am here this podium and this experience is more and more special."" Outside the front runners, Germany's Nico Hulkenberg underlined his reputation as one of the most promising young drivers on the grid with an excellent fifth place in the uncompetitive Sauber. His compatriot Nico Rosberg finished sixth for Mercedes ahead of Australian Daniel Ricciardo of Toro Rosso, who will replace Webber at Red Bull next season. Romain Grosjean of Lotus held off the fast-charging Hamilton for eighth, while Britain's Jenson Button earned a single point for McLaren, who were celebrating their 50th anniversary as an F1 team. Hamilton, who had to contend with a slow puncture which meant an extra pit stop, conceded his title hopes were over. ""It's awful when you are just empty of energy and have given everything for just two points -- and that's it for the championship now,"" he told BBC Sport. The F1 circuit will now depart Europe for the next round under the lights on the spectacular street circuit in Singapore with Vettel in prime position for a fourth straight title.","Sebastian Vettel wins Italian Grand Prix at Monza .

"(CNN) -- No doubt, the Miami Heat's current 27-game win streak is impressive. But the team still has a few games to go to top the 1971-1972 Los Angeles Lakers' run of 33 straight consecutive victories. And the Heat would need a few lifetimes to surpass Jahangir Khan. Khan might not be a household name in NBA circles, but in Pakistan and the world of squash he's huge. Forget LeBron James. When it comes to impressive winning streaks, Khan is king by virtue of his taking 555 straight matches between 1981 and 1986. The squash star's momentous mark is proof that there are record streaks everywhere. That includes in sports, yes, but also politics, business and more. Here's a short list of 10 long-term milestones that might surprise you: . 1. The heat is on, and on, and on . Death Valley, California, has that name for a reason. On July 10, 1913, the thermostat in a community called Furnace Creek topped out at 134 degrees Fahrenheit -- making it the hottest day ever recorded, anywhere. But the heat in this desert area is not only intense, it also endures. Take summer 2001, when the high temperature met or exceeded 100 degrees for 154 consecutive days, according to the Death Valley National Park website. For those keeping score at home, that means every day for more than five months. Depends on your heat-warped perspective if you think summer 1996 was worse. In that time, the high temps soared to or past 110 degrees for 105 straight days -- and exceeded 120 degrees for 40 consecutive days. 2. A really long shot on the court . If the Heat cruise past the Lakers, they'll have made NBA history. But not necessarily basketball history. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the pinnacle of perfection in the sport was coach John Wooden's UCLA men's basketball team. Amid a run of 11 straight NCAA titles, the Bruins reeled off 88 straight wins between 1971 and 1974. That mark stood until late 2010, when the University of Connecticut's women's hoops program under coach Geno Auriemma notched 90 straight wins. To put it in perspective for Miami, they'd need to roughly triple their amount of victories to top that. 3. 'One Sweet' 16 weeks . Since the 1950s, the Billboard Hot 100 chart has been home to the biggest names in the music biz: Elvis Presley. Michael Jackson. The Beatles. So, who was the biggest of them all, when it came to consecutive weeks as the No. 1 song? None other than Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey, together singing ""One Sweet Day."" The song held the Hot 100's top spot for 16 weeks, beating out Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" and Boyz II Men's ""I'll Make Love To You"" by two weeks. ""Macarena"" and Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind,"" among others, later made a run at the top honor only to fall short. For a single, topping the charts for basically four months is a stellar feat. Still, it's one that falls well short of Billboard's most consecutive weeks for a chart-topping album. That record belongs to the ""West Side Story"" soundtrack, which was first on the Billboard 200 for 54 weeks in 1962 and 1963, an accomplishment not even Jackson's ""Thriller"" could match. 4. Up for 21 years running, down under . For the past few years, a recession has gripped much of the world. In the early 2000s, the United States and some other economies dipped in the months and years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Before that, the tech bubble burst. Basically, there's been a roller-coaster of bad and good news. Except in Australia, where it's been all good. According to the Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan, Australia has notched 21 straight years of annual economic growth. Among other advanced economies, the next closest competitor, Israel, isn't even halfway there. In other words, no developed country comes close. This streak isn't over. So there's no telling if Australia will turn things upside down even more, by hurdling or skirting economic obstacles to grow for another 21 years straight. 5. Most famous for being a loser? By most any measure, Susan Lucci has had an extraordinary career: as a long-running soap opera standout, a reality show star, an author and an entrepreneur. Still, the measure that many most affiliate Lucci with is how many times she lost. Eighteen, to be exact. That's the number of times the ""All My Children"" star had been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award, and also how many times she went home empty-handed. Her bad luck ended in 1999, when she finally broke through on her 19th try with a best actress award. It was a win for her, but also the moment she lost hold of one of her biggest claims to fame. 6. The Democratic bastion of Alabama . Follow current presidential politics, and the states don't get much more Republican red than Alabama. In 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney crushed President Barack Obama with 61% of the vote. Sen. John McCain, the Republicans' standard bearer, got the same percentage four years earlier. But what some outside the South may not realize is that, when McCain ran, Democrats still had power in Montgomery -- just as, seemingly, they always had. While it may seem the opposite holds true now, the South was once as staunchly Democratic as they come. But that started to change, especially in national politics, in the 1970s and 1980s. Alabama was part of that tide, having last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate -- by the name of Jimmy Carter, the governor of neighboring Georgia -- in 1976. But state politics was an entirely different story. It wasn't until the November 2010 election that Republicans were able to win a majority of seats in both chambers of the Alabama state legislature. 7. American juggernaut . Talent shows are nothing new, being found in most every town and seemingly most every television network nowadays. In this clutter, especially with so many entertainment options, it's hard to break through and remain in front year after year after year. Then how do you explain ""American Idol""? There have been popular shows for generations, but none have had the success of ""American Idol."" For eight years running, the Fox network show topped the Nielsen charts as the nation's most watched program, year in and year out. In 2011 -- more than a year after CNN and others reported on the program's ratings ""slide"" -- the ""American Idol"" Wednesday night show still topped the Nielsen yearly chart. No. 2? ""American Idol's"" Thursday program. The streak ended in 2012, when NBC's ""Sunday Night Football"" took Nielsen's top spot. Still, ""American Idol"" could take solace having already left other legendary TV shows -- ""Seinfeld,"" ""All in the Family"" and ""M*A*S*H"" among them -- in its wake. 8. Newspapers that keep rolling . Some have said newspapers are dying. Then again, sometimes that happens when you're hundreds of years old. But while many have gone out of print, some publications are still going -- under the same name, and just as ready to grab and read as they were centuries ago. While the international honor for longest continuous published newspaper is subject to some debate, one title in contention is Italy's La Gazzetta di Mantova. That paper was founded in 1664 and is still around, website included. There's less dispute in the United States, albeit two newspapers do boast the ""oldest newspaper"" title. One is the New Hampshire Gazette, a bi-weekly paper that first rolled off the presses in 1756, some 20 years before the birth of the United States. The other is the Hartford Courant (originally The Connecticut Courant), a daily that bills itself as ""the country's oldest newspaper in continuous publication"" by virtue of its founding in 1764. 9. Mexico's party of record -- for 71 years . Mexico gained independence from its colonial rulers in 1821, experiencing periods of stability and tumult in the subsequent decades. But for most of the 20th century, political stasis dominated the country, under the guise of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. The party also known as PRI began in 1929, 19 years after the launch of the revolution aimed at unseating dictator Porfirio Diaz. Despite or, perhaps, because of criticisms that it was authoritarian and corrupt, the party won 12 consecutive national elections, which occurred roughly every six years. It wasn't just Mexico City the party controlled: The PRI held most top local and state positions as well, at least until the 1990s. But its 12-election, 71-year winning streak ended in 2000, when the right-wing National Action Party broke through and Vicente Fox became Mexico's president. Its ouster from power, however, wasn't permanent. In 2012, PRI unseated its rival party and regained the presidency under Enrique Pena Nieto. 10. Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? 56. In American sports lore, that number speaks for itself. It is forever attached to legendary New York Yankees slugger Joe DiMaggio and his magical run during the 1941 baseball season. During his career, which was interrupted about halfway by his service in World War II, DiMaggio compiled 361 home runs and a career .325 batting average. That was enough to win him a place in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and, in 1969, the distinction as the sport's greatest living player. But it's the streak, it seems, that may be his most enduring legacy. Every season, it seems, a player makes a run at the 56-game hitting streak. And every season, he falls woefully short. CNN's Julie In contributed to this report.","The Miami Heat have won 27 straight games and are aiming for an NBA record 33 .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court made a landmark ruling Thursday upholding the controversial, massive reform of health care coverage initiated by President Barack Obama. Here are four things Americans learned about the federal government's grand vision to ensure health care for everyone under so-called Obamacare: . Skipping insurance no longer an option . The individual mandate is the centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration's signature law. The mandate, which the high court let stand, requires most Americans to have health care insurance. Opponents had contended that the government couldn't force citizens to buy health coverage, but the Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the individual mandate is legal under the government's taxing powers. The ""tax"" comes in the form of a financial penalty on certain individuals who do not obtain health insurance, and the Constitution allows for such a tax, the court said. The justices, however, found problems in how the law threatens to remove Medicaid funding -- the government's health coverage for the poor -- from states that don't participate in an expansion of eligibility. The court said that the government must remove that threat, and Obama acknowledged remedies are needed. The year 2014 is the deadline for everyone to get insurance. Not obtaining insurance in 2014 will cost a person $95 or 1% of his or her income, whichever is higher. In 2015, it's $325, or 2% of income. For families, the penalty will be $285 per household or 1% of income, whichever is greater. By 2016, it goes up to $2,085 per family or 2.5% of income. Penalties will rise each year. Health care ruling gives GOP new attack line -- taxes . The law promises improved collective health . The law does promise better care and better health for America -- at a cost. Federal health spending is projected to grow from 5.6% of gross domestic product in 2011 to about 9.4% by 2035, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Under the law, preventive care services such as mammograms, physical exams, colonoscopies and vaccinations will be fully covered by insurance companies. This requirement kicked in for new health insurance plans that began on or after September 2010. Without the individual mandate, 40 million Americans would have remained uninsured, researchers at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center estimated. Had the health care law been struck down by the high court, those without insurance would have grown by millions, researchers at the Urban Institute said. Without the law, ""in the worst case scenario, the number of uninsured Americans would increase to 57.7 million in 2014 and to 65.7 million in 2019. In the best case, the number grows to 53.1 million in 2014 and 57 million in 2019,"" the researchers wrote. 'Obamacare' symbol: Court ruling is 'right direction' Uninsured not the only ones who'll see a change . Many Americans are already covered by employers' health benefits. At companies with fewer than 50 workers, the employees must obtain insurance themselves. Companies with 50 or more full-time employees must start providing health insurance for all workers by 2014 or face stiff penalties. Cash-strapped entrepreneurs can buy insurance at state exchanges and can get tax credits if their annual individual income ranges between 100% and 400% of the poverty line, which this year translates to $11,170 and $44,680. Solo entrepreneurs and small businesses can shop for less expensive insurance through the exchanges in each state. One-person businesses can also turn to exchanges for individuals. Companies with up to 100 workers may turn to Small Business Health Options Programs. Both keep down costs by increasing the size of the insured pool and spreading out the risk. No exchange is up and running yet. In theory, though, the exchanges will give small firms the ability to buy insurance at rates once belonging to large companies. By the numbers: Health insurance .

Despite his pledge to repeal the law, if elected, Romney has promised to continue some of the law's consumer protections, such as the ban on preventing care based on pre-existing conditions. Said Obama: ""I know that there will be a lot discussion about this, about who won and who lost. That's how these things tend to be viewed here in Washington. But that discussion completely misses the point."" He said Thursday that the principle upheld by the high court's ruling is that no American should go bankrupt because of illness.

"(CNN) -- Your head is pounding, burning with raging fever, your aching bones feeling like they weigh a ton. Covered in profuse sweating, your exhausted body shivers with teeth-chattering chills. For anyone who's suffered through severe bouts of malaria, this is the nauseating roller coaster the disease typically wreaks on its victims. But now an award-winning innovation by two students in Burkina Faso could help reduce the devastating impact of the life-threatening disease, which is caused by parasites that are spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Moctar Dembele, who is from Burkina Faso, and Gerard Niyondiko, from Burundi, have used locally sourced herbs and natural ingredients to create a soap they say repels mosquitoes, in order to prevent malaria. Read this: Innovation to save lives in Africa . Dubbed ""Fasoap,"" the innovation was awarded the $25,000 Grand Prize in the Global Social Venture Competition (GSVC), in April. Launched by Berkeley MBA students, the GSVC is a global competition designed to help budding entrepreneurs transform their ideas into businesses that will have a positive social impact. Fasoap is made from shea butter, essential lemongrass oil and other ingredients that are still a secret. ""After using the soap, it leaves on the skin a scent that repels mosquitoes,"" says Niyondiko, who studies with Dembele at the International Institute for Water and Environmental Engineering in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. ""In addition, waste water products contain substances that prevent the development of mosquito larvae, because the sanitation problem in Africa is one of the causes of mosquito vectors of malaria."" Read this: Off-road bikers race to save lives in rural Africa . About half of the world's population is at risk of malaria, according to the World Health Organization. The disease's impact is mostly felt in the world's poorest countries; in 2010, there were an estimated 660,000 malaria deaths, 90% of which occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly among children under five years old. In many of these countries, apart from its high toll on human life, malaria also exacts a heavy burden on their economies. Household budgets are being squeezed by high fees for drugs and treatments, doctors' fees and transportation to clinics; marginalized communities are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty due to lost productivity or income because of the disease; state funds are being drained to pay for the maintenance of health facilities and research programs. Read this: Africa catching 'Western diseases' Niyondiko says their anti-malaria soap company, which is called Faso Soap, will help address all these issues. ""In our country the majority of the population lives below the poverty line,"" he explains, adding that most people can't afford to regularly buy medicines and products such as anti-mosquito creams, sprays or protective nets. ""So we thought of a repellent and larvicidal mosquito soap which will be accessible and affordable to the majority of the population, seeing that soap is a commodity product and especially not going to add other additional costs to the population,"" says Niyondiko. ""Our soap will fulfill the desire of the population to be clean, as well as protect them from malaria, without any additional cost to them."" The team is now working on the optimization of the soap through clinical trials, with the aim of entering the market by 2015, starting from Burkina Faso. ""Our goal is that our soap is widely distributed to reach the largest possible number in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world affected by malaria,"" says Niyondiko. ""This is to say that NGOs, companies will be our potential customers for the distribution of our products. After the victory obtained at Berkeley there are so many NGOs, companies who spoke to a partnership with us in order to distribute our soap in different parts, even outside Africa."" James Logan, medical entomologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says: ""The concept of putting a repellent into a soap is appealing as it can often be difficult to get people to use a topical repellent."" He cautions, however, that there needs to be published scientific evidence that the soap can successfully reduce malaria transmission. To win the GSVC Grand Prize, Niyondiko, 35, and Dembele, 22, beat 650 competitors from nearly 40 countries. Their victory marks the first time an entry from Africa has won the competition. ""It is a feeling of joy and pride for us and for Africa in general,"" says Niyondiko of their win. ""It also shows that in Africa we are not back(ward) and that Africa's problems can be solved by Africans themselves.""","Two students have created a soap they say repels mosquitoes .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Large-scale anti-government protests and more violence unfolded across Syria Friday as tens of thousands of demonstrators converged on public squares to protest President Bashar al-Assad's regime. The protests coincided with reports of increased violence against demonstrators by al-Assad's security forces, even as an Arab League fact-finding mission works to determine whether the Syrian government is abiding by a peace agreement to end a brutal crackdown on protesters. As they have in their nearly 10 months of resistance, Syrian activists and opposition groups used Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to urge thousands to evade al-Assad's forces and defy government-imposed curfews. ""Today we will go out to the squares not to show the Arab League something, but we will go out because we have rights,"" Saleh Al-Hamwi, a spokesman for the Syrian Revolution General Council in Hama said in a video statement posted on YouTube. ""And we will go after these rights."" The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition network that claims to have people in various locations in Syria, said 35 people were killed. Deaths occurred in Idlib city, Daraa, Hama, Homs city, the Homs province town of Tal Kalakh near Lebanon, the Damascus suburbs and Abu Kamal in the east. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group with contacts throughout the country, said that security forces attempting to prevent tens of thousands of protesters from reaching a square in Idlib city shot and wounded 25 protesters. The observatory said demonstrators turned out in Idlib province towns as well. It also said security forces fired their weapons at demonstrators in Daraa, in the south, and Deir Ezzor, in the east. CNN cannot independently verify opposition accounts of violence or reports of deaths and injuries in Syria. Al-Assad's government has restricted access by international journalists. The LCC said there were 382 demonstrations across the country, including a sit-in that drew tens of thousands in front of Arab League observers in Douma, outside Damascus. The opposition group said more than 30,000 demonstrators in the Idlib province town of Saraqeb chanted to topple the regime, and the military fired shots to disperse protesters. An Arab League observer mission also visited the Damascus suburb of Harasta on Friday, the LCC said. State-run Syrian TV reported a pro-regime demonstration in Homs in support of the Arab League protocol, an effort criticized as pointless by many opposition members. The Syrian government said Friday, via the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, that Arab League observers visited Douma, portions of Damascus, various neighborhoods in Homs, which opposition groups say has been under siege by Syrian forces. The Facebook page for the Syrian Revolution General Council, an umbrella organization for opposition groups, is one of the most prominent outlets for the uprising -- with over 330,000 followers who share news, videos, information and ideas online. Opposition groups have dubbed the rallies ""The Crawl to Freedom Square,"" encouraging protesters to defy what they say are sniper attacks by Syrian forces and crawl to central public squares rather than remain in small protest groups in local neighborhoods. The reports of violence prompted Britain's Foreign Office on Friday to say it welcomed news that the Arab League planned to increase the number of observers in Syria. An Arab League official has told CNN that 75 monitors are currently in Syria with more expected to arrive in coming days. ""Unfortunately, reports show that the violence has continued in Syria over the past few days. I urge the Syrian government to meet fully its obligations to the Arab League, including immediately ending the repression and withdrawing security forces from cities,"" Alistair Burt, the Foreign Office's minister for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. ""The Syrian government must allow the Arab League mission independent and unrestricted access to all areas of Syria and to the Syrian people."" A human rights advocate in Beirut, who is talking to people on the ground in Syria, said it appears the monitors have seen violence and are making headway gathering information. ""It does seem they are getting access to people and are getting in to see the reality on the ground,"" the source said. The Arab League has suspended Syria's membership over its crackdown, and al-Assad has been under enormous international pressure to end the violence. Earlier this month, al-Assad agreed to a peace initiative with the Arab League that calls for security forces to withdraw from cities, release detainees and end violence. Part of the agreement calls for Arab League observers to monitor whether the government abides by the initiative. More than 5,000 people have died since mid-March, when al-Assad began the crackdown on anti-government protesters calling for his ouster, the United Nations said this month. But opposition groups put the toll at more than 6,000. The uprising has spawned both the creation of the Free Syrian Army, a rebel force composed of military defectors, and efforts to create a breakaway government. Other opposition groups, most notably the Syrian National Council, have emerged. Mohamed Hamado, an FSA lieutenant colonel, said the army has been ordered to halt operations since the start of the Arab League monitoring mission. ""We are still being attacked by the Syrian forces, so the nature of our operations is defensive at this stage,"" he said. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Yousuf Basil, Joe Sterling and Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Opposition group says 382 protests held across Syria .

"(CNN) -- Since news first broke about the shooting at a Connecticut elementary school, people began wondering how something so horrible could happen. Within a few hours, before the magnitude of the tragedy was fully known, reports began to surface that the shooter, Adam Lanza, was autistic or had Asperger's syndrome in addition to a possible personality or anxiety disorder such as obessive-compulsive disorder. A relative told investigators that Lanza had a form of autism, according to a law enforcement official, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation. CNN has not been able to confirm independently whether Lanza was diagnosed with autism or Asperger's syndrome, a higher-functioning form of autism. Russ Hanoman, a friend of Lanza's mother, told CNN that Lanza had Asperger's syndrome and that he was ""very withdrawn emotionally."" However, national autism organizations cautioned against speculation about a link between violence and autism or Asperger's. While the motive for this crime is still unknown and may never be fully understood, what is clear, according to experts, is that autism cannot be blamed. ""There is absolutely no evidence or any reliable research that suggests a linkage between autism and planned violence,"" the Autism Society said in a statement. ""To imply or suggest that some linkage exists is wrong and is harmful to more than 1.5 million law-abiding, nonviolent and wonderful individuals who live with autism each day."" Man with Asperger's shares thoughts on Sandy Hook shooting . Peter Bell of Autism Speaks said, ""Autism did not cause this horror."" Bell, executive vice president for programs and services for the advocacy and research group, is also the father of a son with autism. Bell said it's not unusual to want to figure out why someone would commit such a heinous crime, but he also cautioned people to do so responsibly. And by definition, he said, people with a diagnosis of autism or Asperger's are not inclined to commit an act of violence. The likelihood of this happening would be no different than the rest of the population, he added. With autism, no longer invisible . One in 88 children in the United States have autism, according to the latest estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Boys with autism outnumber girls 5 to 1, according to the CDC; 1 in 54 boys in the United States have autism. Autism spectrum disorders, including Asperger's syndrome, are a range of developmental disorders of the brain. They can cause significant social impairments, communication problems and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior. It's important for the public to know that the gunman's actions can't be linked with autism spectrum disorders, said Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist and autism expert at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland. ""Aggression and violence in the ASD population is reactive, not preplanned and deliberate,"" he said. For example, sometimes children with autism will get violent because they are sick or frustrated and unable to communicate how they feel. Wiznitzer also said that violence among autism spectrum disorder patients is ""sometimes due to ASD features such as desire for sameness but usually related to a co-existing disorder such as anxiety or ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactive disorder)."" Commenters and CNN iReporters also weighed in on the issue. ""I have Asperger's, a very mild form of autism,"" said one comenter, oblivion328. ""Though as an adult I no longer exhibit any of the associated behaviors aside from some manageable social anxiety, I recall very well having tantrums as a child. I sincerely doubt if you put a gun in my hand during such an episode I'd start shooting people. Most autistics are more likely to harm themselves than anyone around them really."" ""When you talk about autism or anything on the autism spectrum, you're talking about a neural disorder,"" said CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""I think the terms do matter here. Second of all, just this whole idea that it's linked with violence in some way and specifically pre-planned violence, I think we can dispense with that."" What concerns advocacy groups such as Autism Speaks, the Autism Society and the Autism Research Initiative is that linking autism with violence will once again stigmatize people with autism and turn back the clock on progress made so far. ""Please do not judge any individual with autism based on what is being said about a killer of innocent children and teachers,"" the Autism Society said in its statement. A blood test for autism? Bell said he is concerned that linking autism to this crime could even endanger innocent people and that the community will begin to fear those with autism. ""We worked so hard to try (integrate them) into our communities, give them opportunities to be employees, to be able to live in our neighborhoods, and if people do jump to conclusions, we really risk taking significant steps backward for people in this population,"" he said. In a statement, Autistic Global Initiative Director Valerie Paradiz said, ""The autism community has long labored toward building understanding, awareness and trust within communities throughout the United States and the world. ""As adults with autism living productive, peaceful lives, we urge the media and professionals who participate in speculative interviews about the motives of the accused shooter to refrain from misleading comments about autism and other neurodevelopmental disabilities. ... (M)isinformation could easily trigger increased prejudice and misunderstanding."" CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.","A relative says shooter Adam Lanza had a form of autism, law enforcement official says .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe announced Tuesday a 26-member Cabinet mainly composed of allies from his previous appointments. It retains a ministry for enacting the policy of seizing the majority stake of foreign-owned firms. ""I am glad we now have a government of Zimbabwe following the harmonized elections,"" Misheck Sibanda, chief secretary to the president and Cabinet, told journalists at the State House. ""The Cabinet has been reduced from 33 under the government of national unity to 26 ministers."" Zimbabwe has had no functioning Cabinet since the July 31 elections when Mugabe was re-elected. Prior to that, Mugabe's Zanu PF party and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's MDC party shared power. The new Cabinet retains the Ministry of Indigenisation, the policy of seizing the majority stake of foreign owned firms and giving them to black Zimbabweans. Critics of the policy have said it mainly benefits a few elites. In the list released, Jonathan Moyo bounces back as media, information and broadcasting services minister. He was the minister who drafted tough media laws in 2002 that have resulted in the deportation of foreign journalists and the closing of some media organizations. Mugabe tossed him out of Zanu PF after Moyo stood as an independent in the 2008 elections. Former Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa is now the finance minister, taking over from Tendai Biti, who was from the MDC party under the 2009-2013 coalition government. The 89-year-old Mugabe and Zanu PF got more than a two-thirds majority in parliament in the July 31 elections.","Mugabe's Cabinet is mainly composed of his allies from his previous appointments .

"(CNN) -- Australia appealed for leniency after one of its citizens was sentenced Wednesday to 500 lashes and a year in prison by a Saudi Arabian court. Mansor Almaribe, 45, was found guilty of blasphemy after he was arrested last month in Medina while on a pilgrimage, Australian officials said. It's unclear what Almaribe, a Shia Muslim from Victoria state, said or did to get arrested. ""The ambassador has urgently contacted Saudi authorities and will make strong representations, including to key figures in the Saudi government, seeking leniency,"" said Kate Sieper, a foreign affairs spokeswoman. Family members said they are worried about his health. ""He is sick, and he has back injuries and he has diabetes,"" his son, Issam Almaribe, told CNN affiliate 9 News Australia. Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman Usama Al-Nugali said that the court system has an appeal process that Almaribe can resort to. ""We don't comment on court decisions or legal procedures. However, any court pleading, primary and judicial decisions could be appealed in the appeals court. All individuals have the right for a defense attorney, including non-Saudis who also enjoy the right of the presence of their diplomatic mission,"" he said. Consular officials have contacted Almaribe several times by phone since his arrest in mid-November, and were in the courtroom during the reading of the verdict. Australian officials said they were informed he was convicted of blasphemy and ""making comments insulting to prophet Mohammed's relatives."" His sentence was originally two years imprisonment along with the 500 lashes, but the court reduced the sentence by a year, consular officials said. It was unclear when the lashing punishment will be carried out. Blasphemy is punishable by up to a death sentence under the strict Muslim law in Saudi Arabia.

"(CNN) -- Squash, the bridesmaid of racquet sports, will hope to finally recognize its Olympic dream after winning a place on the shortlist of candidates to be included at the 2020 Games. While tennis, table tennis and badminton have long been on the Olympic agenda, squash has failed to impress the International Olympic Committee during its previous attempts, with campaigns to be included at London 2012 and Rio de Janeiro 2016 falling on deaf ears. But Wednesday's announcement by the IOC means it, along with wrestling and the combined baseball/softball bid, will have the chance of securing the one final place in September's vote. There is the offer of a reprieve for wrestling, which was dropped from the program in February, while baseball and softball were axed after the 2008 Games but have since streamlined their competitions in order to win back favor. Wrestling had long been considered an iconic Olympic sport having been part of the Games since its inception in 1896 and missing out just once -- at Paris in 1900. Both freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling had been mainstays of the Olympics, but this year's shock decision led to the sport's chief Raphael Martinetti resigning as President of the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles. Golf and rugby sevens are two new sports to be included at Rio next year and squash is now hoping it will finally make its debut in 2020. ""This is a great day for squash as it takes us one step closer to realizing our long-held ambition to join the Olympic Games,"" Malaysia's seven-time world champion Nicol David said in a statement following the announcement. ""I said to the (IOC) Executive Board that the one big regret in my career is that I have never had the chance to compete in the Olympic Games, but I would happily trade all my seven world titles for the chance of Olympic gold. ""Hopefully that showed what competing in the Games means to me. It was a true honor to play a part in our presentation and I will do everything I can as we head towards Buenos Aires to help our campaign."" Squash will now hope to succeed where the likes of wushu, wakeboarding, roller sports, karate and sport climbing failed, missing out on contention for consideration. The sport has tried to make itself more attractive to the IOC, using all-glass courts, video review systems and a white ball to help make it more spectator-friendly. ""Squash would grow all over the world with the Olympic Movement,"" World Squash Federation President N. Ramachandran said in a statement. ""We are a growing, global sport played in 185 countries by millions across the world. ""We offer the genuine prospect of new nations on the medal podium. We would be easy and low cost to integrate into the Olympic Games with just 64 athletes, two competition courts that can be built in days and we have a great track record of being hosted in iconic locations. ""I think all these elements were important considerations for the IOC Executive Board. It is critical now that we build further momentum and support ahead of the IOC member vote in Buenos Aires on September 8, and this is what the global squash family is completely focused on."" The IOC uses 39 criteria to decide which sports make it through to the Games, with categories such as popularity, good governance and respect for the Olympic values all taken into consideration. IOC president Jacques Rogge, who is set to step down in September following a 12-year term, told reporters he was impressed with the presentations put before the 14 board members. ""The Executive Board received excellent presentations today from eight International Federations,"" he said. ""It was never going to be an easy decision but I feel my colleagues on the board made a good decision in selecting baseball/softball, squash and wrestling to be put forward in Buenos Aires. ""I wish the three shortlisted sports the best of luck in the run-up to the vote in September and would like to thank the other sports for their hard work and dedication.""","Squash, baseball/softball and wrestling shortlisted as potential sports for 2020 Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Along the lush sea-islands and the Atlantic coastal plains of the southern East coast of America, a distinctive group of tidewater communities has stuck together throughout the centuries, preserving its African cultural heritage and carving out a lifestyle that is uniquely its own. The Gullah/Geechee people are direct descendants of West African slaves brought into the United States around the 1700s. They were forced to work in rice paddies, cotton fields and indigo plantations along the South Carolina-Georgia seaboard where the moist climate and fertile land were very similar to their African homelands. After the abolition of slavery, they settled in remote villages around the coastal swath, where, thanks to their relative isolation, they formed strong communal ties and a unique culture that has endured for centuries. ""The Gullah/Geechee Nation is an extremely tightly knit community,"" says Chieftess Queen Quet, who was chosen to represent the Gullah/Geechee people in 2000. ""It is as tightly knit as a sweet grass basket that's sewn together and as tightly knit as a cast net is sewn together -- there's strength in it and that means if you pull on it, you can't just get it to break apart."" See also: Tracing the slaves who shaped America . Brought to America from rice-producing Sierra Leone and other surrounding countries, the enslaved Africans came from a wide variety of ethnic groups. For many of them, the first contact with the New World was Sullivan's Island -- just off Charleston, South Carolina -- a place of huge emotional value for the Gullah/Geechee community to this day. ""This is the landing point for over 40% of all the African people enslaved in North America,"" says Queen Quet. ""It represents a place of pain; it also represents a place of connection because we're standing at the shore and we're looking eastward -- we're looking back home, we're looking to our mother, the mother land, mother Africa."" Carlie Towne, minister of information of the Gullah/Geechee Nation, says the Africans brought to the island were quarantined in pestilence houses to make sure they didn't have any diseases. ""A lot of people refer to this as the Ellis Island, but it's not, because we did not come freely,"" says Towne. ""It didn't kill the spirit, because we are here today and paying homage today to our ancestors. It actually gave us a sense of community, of living together. Everything we did, it was a way for us to actually become who we are. It actually made us stronger and we continue today the legacy of our ancestors."" Read related: Brazil's thriving African culture . To this day, the Gullah/Geechee people are trying to hold steadfastly to the way of life of their African ancestors, passing on their traditions from one generation to the next. They gather sweet grass to practice the ancient African art of basket making; they pay homage to their West African traditions by keeping alive the ring shout music folk tradition; they make a living by fishing shrimps and harvesting oysters, using handmade nets and casting them the way their ancestors did centuries ago. ""I fished with my father ever since I've been seven or eight,"" says Ricky Wright, vice president of the Gullah/Geechee Fishing Association. ""It passes down because it's just a natural thing for us -- my parents did it, I'm quite sure my parents' parents did it, and it just descended down."" It is this natural connection that helps the Gullah/Geechee community tie their past to their future survival. ""[It's] almost like history repeating itself, what goes around comes around,"" says Wright. ""OK, we've entered the computer age, but we still have to have hands-on for most of the things we do and fishing is like hands-on. You've got to do it to know it -- to keep the culture strong is to keep what you do intact."" Another key trait marking the population's distinctive cultural identity is the use of an English-based creole vernacular known as Gullah. Professor Salikoko S. Mufwene, of the department of linguistics at the University of Chicago, says the enslaved Africans and their descendants created the dialect in response to their own linguistic diversity. ""It is English modified under the influence of African languages,"" he says. ""Any population that appropriates the language that is not their own, they are going to modify it."" Estimates about the current number of Gullah/Geechee people vary and exact figures are hard to verify. Gullah/Geechee leaders say that an approximately one million people belong to the nation, while other reports put the number closer to 250,000. Mufwene says that after the Second World War there were several migrations out of the region towards cities like New York and Washington in search of jobs. He adds, however, that many of those who'd depart would often become disenchanted with life in the city and return back home. Watch video: Slave descendants uphold African roots . What seems to be more certain is that Gullah/Geechee people have preserved the cultural heritage of their ancestors more than any other black Americans in the United States. ""We have the highest retention of African tradition in America,"" says Towne. ""African-Americans have assimilated more so they don't have those African traditions that we have -- they don't treasure them, they don't honor their tradition like we do. And we've been able to hold onto that because of isolation, because of the strong will and our self-determination. We still eat the same foods [as] our ancestors [when they] came from Africa."" Mufwene agrees. He says the Gullah/Geechee people cook differently from continental African-Americans and the ways they interact with each other are very reminiscent of traditional life in Africa. ""They have also kept animal tales that are very similar to animal tales in Africa,"" he adds. ""The characters are not exactly the same, because the ecology has changed, but the themes of the tales are very similar to the themes that you find in Africa."" Back on Sullivan's Island, overlooking the vast ocean that brought her ancestors to the shores of enslavement, Towne says Gullah/Geechee people should not lose sight of their past. ""This is actually the bloodline of our people, the water,"" she says. ""I must come here and my children come here. And my children's children must come here too. Because we must never forget.""","The Gullah/Geechee is a group of people based in the North Carolina-Georgia seaboard .

"(CNN) -- A lightning strike in metropolitan Miami Monday afternoon killed a man and injured two of his friends, police said. Andres Telles, 31, and his friends, Fidelmar Montero and Miguel Lopez, were pressure-washing a tractor-trailer rig when the lightning bolt hit. ""We went outside, and all three of them were on the ground,"" Janet Suarez told CNN affiliate WSVN. Suzrez and her son administered CPR, but couldn't save Telles, she said. The injured men, Montero and Lopez, were taken to a local hospital and are listed in stable condition, according to the Miami-Dade Police Department. It was unclear how close the men were to the spot where lightning struck. ""We're still investigating whether the individuals were directly struck by the lightning or the lightning struck the ground nearby,"" Det. Robin Pinkard told WSVN. Lightning strikes caused 28 deaths and 139 injuries in the United States -- the latest year for which figures are available, the National Weather Service said. ""One in 3,000 people has a chance of being hit by lightning (in a lifetime),"" said CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""Thankfully, very few people die, but it happens a lot more than people realize."" Last month, two farmers died and three others were injured in Buckeye, Kentucky when lightning struck a barn. Also last month, a lightning strike from a fast-moving storm in Colorado injured 12 soldiers who were training. And while weather experts say that the best place to be in a lightning strike is indoors, that advice didn't work for two women in Houma, Louisiana. They were struck three weeks apart -- one in a grocery store in July, and another in her home in May.","The lightning hit as the men washed a tractor trailer .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans on a House committee rejected strenuous Democratic objections in voting Friday that Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner waived her constitutional right against self-incrimination at a prior hearing. The resolution was the first step in an effort by Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the GOP chairman of the House Oversight Committee, to force Lerner to return to answer questions about targeting of conservative groups by the unit she headed. It passed on a 22-17 vote, with every Republican in favor and every Democrat opposed, following an unusually vitriolic hearing. Democrats accused Issa of a partisan witch hunt that threatened Lerner's 5th Amendment rights, while Republicans seethed at how Lerner had first declared her innocence before refusing to answer questions on constitutional grounds at the earlier hearing. Issa's resolution is likely to set off a lengthy legal back-and-forth with Lerner and her attorneys that could include her eventual appearance at another hearing, where committee members agreed she would again assert her 5th Amendment rights. That could then lead to efforts to cite her for contempt of Congress. Lerner headed the IRS unit that targeted some conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Disclosure of the targeting in an inspector general's report in early May set off a political firestorm, leading to investigations by the FBI, congressional committees, the inspector general and the IRS itself. Republicans grill acting IRS chief over targeting probe . Under subpoena to testify before Issa's panel on May 22, Lerner instead made a statement that declared she did nothing wrong, and then invoked her 5th Amendment right. Issa dismissed her, but warned the committee might call her back. Friday's hearing was the first step toward forcing Lerner to appear again. If approved, Issa's resolution would set the stage for requesting her to come back and testify because she had waived her 5th Amendment right in the view of the committee. ""I believe Lois Lerner waived her 5th Amendment privileges,"" Issa said. ""She did so when she voluntarily chose to deliver an opening statement"" that included what he described as ""four specific denials ....at the core of the committee's investigation into this matter."" Other Republicans called Lerner's actions an arrogant rejection of congressional authority. ""Lois Lerner is in fact the poster child for thumbing her nose, a federal bureaucrat thumbing her nose at Congress,"" declared GOP Rep. John Mica of Florida, later calling the matter ""a showdown, really, in who's in control of the government and whether we honor the Constitution."" Democrats strenuously objected to the resolution, calling it a political gesture and asking for the committee to first hold a hearing on the legal basis for the finding that Lerner had waived her constitutional right. Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts said Issa's resolution would hinder efforts to compel Lerner to testify if the matter ends up in court over an eventual contempt of Congress citation. ""I think what we're doing today will doom our effort to hold Ms. Lerner accountable,"" Lynch said, adding some Democrats would have supported Issa ""if you did it properly."" Instead, ""we have not had the meaningful, deliberate process that would give weight to our decision,"" he added, calling Friday's hearing ""a political process."" Another Democrat, Rep. Steven Horsford of Nevada, called the ""back-and-forth political bickering"" at Friday's hearing ""an embarrassment."" He accused Issa of conducting ""witch hunts"" instead of seeking solutions to the problems at the IRS cited by the inspector general's report. ""These are the issues that the American people want us to focus on, not more partisan arguing and gridlock,"" Horsford said, adding that Issa's resolution does nothing to fix the improper targeting. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the elected House delegate from the District of Columbia, said she and other Democrats agreed with Republicans that Lerner's testimony would be vital to the panel's investigation of the targeting scandal. ""I hope we can find a way to get to the real point, perhaps by offering her some kind of immunity,"" Norton said. Issa responded that the committee first had to take the procedural step of concluding Lerner's testimony from the May 22 hearing, which remained open. Only then could the panel try to strike an immunity deal, he said. When Norton persisted in questioning Issa about the matter, he abruptly declared her allotted five minutes to speak had expired and moved on. In another sharp exchange, Issa argued with Democratic Rep. John Tierney of Massachusetts over a GOP memo that included a request that it not be distributed to all of the committee's Democrats to reduce the risk of it becoming public. Tierney asked Issa which members he didn't want to see the memo, but Issa avoided the question and cut him off, saying, ""The gentleman's time has expired."" IRS targeting scandal reshaped by new details . ""Well, the gentleman's excuse is lame,"" Tierney shot back. Republicans have tried to maintain public focus on the evolving IRS targeting scandal, inferring it could reach to the top levels of the Obama administration. No evidence so far shows political motivation or any involvement from outside the IRS, according to the inspector general's report that revealed the targeting and the acting IRS director appointed last month by President Barack Obama to clean up the mess. Both liberal and conservative groups were flagged by the IRS when assessing their eligibility for a tax break available to social welfare organizations. However, only conservative groups faced delayed processing and inappropriate questioning about political activity that would make them ineligible, according to IRS Principal Deputy Commissioner Daniel Werfel and a letter by J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration. IRS screeners used conservative-themed criteria such as a group using the words ""tea party"" on ""Be on the Lookout,"" or BOLO, lists to determine if groups underwent further review for political activity that would make them ineligible. Another category of the BOLO lists also had liberal-themed criteria, including the word ""progressives,"" but that category didn't set off the automatic extra scrutiny for political activity, George's letter said. Under tough questioning Thursday at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Werfel acknowledged that the different BOLO categories meant liberal groups avoided the extra scrutiny cited by the inspector general that included processing delays and extensive questions perceived by conservatives as political intimidation. Werfel repeatedly cautioned that his internal review was incomplete, and that additional information from continuing investigations will be needed to reach definitive conclusions. He noted that 80 groups that have waited more than 120 days for a final decision on their applications for a tax break represent a diverse range of political leanings. All involved in Thursday's meeting agreed Werfel needs more time to figure out exactly what happened, who was responsible and why. That didn't stop Republicans from criticizing his efforts so far. Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the Ways and Means panel's GOP chairman, said Werfel's report lacked accountability and reached unsubstantiated conclusions of no political motivation. ""If there is anything this report shows, it's just how much more work must be done,"" Camp said, noting that Werfel had yet to interview principal figures or get other information necessary to determine the origins or scope of the targeting. Another GOP legislator, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, called Werfel's report ""a sham."" Werfel said the FBI and inspector general are handling interviews of IRS officials involved in the targeting, adding that the investigations could involve criminal behavior. He repeated the assertion in his report that no evidence so far suggests intentional wrongdoing by agency personnel or influence from outside the IRS in the targeting. His report, released Monday, said five managers had been replaced and other steps were taken in response to George's audit last month that set off a political firestorm in Washington. Republican leaders contend the targeting uncovered by the inspector general's audit indicates political villainy by the Obama administration to try to stifle opponents, such as groups with ""tea party"" in their names that were flagged for additional IRS scrutiny. Democrats said Thursday that such allegations are politically motivated instead of based on any evidence. Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the panel, asked Werfel if there is any evidence of White House involvement in the targeting, and Werfel answered there is not.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Her gloves held high, Rita Mrwebi dances in the middle of a blue boxing ring. Eyes focused straight ahead, she unleashes a flurry of thudding jabs and powerful hooks. It's here, inside this small, dark gym at Hillbrow Boxing Club in Johannesburg, where Mrwebi, the South African female welterweight champion, comes to train twice a day. She hasn't had a competitive fight for a year but she's working hard to stay at the top of her game before a big title match in August. ""I'm looking forward to this fight,"" says Mrwebi, who is set to defend her title for the third time. ""It's a very tough fight because I'll be defending what is mine and she also wants my title,"" she adds. ""I'm training very hard because I need to defend this title."" Read this: Is Azumah Nelson Africa's greatest boxer? There's a lot at stake if Mrwebi loses next month. Boxing is her main source of income, but with no sponsors or manager, fights are rare. In fact, she only gets to fight about once a year, and though she's set to take home some $5,000 -- win or lose -- for the August match, she can't afford to lose her title because that's what attracts challengers and ultimately brings money. Yet it's not all about the money. Mrwebi says boxing has also given her purpose whilst growing up in Hillbrow, a notoriously dangerous inner city neighborhood of Johannesburg. ""It did change my life a lot,"" says Mrwebi, who didn't finish school and never got to meet her father. ""It kept me strict. It's a challenging sport; it's a very strict sport,"" adds the champion. ""It kept me from bad things -- from drugs, from bad friends, having lots of boyfriends."" But Mrwebi is not the only one to have benefited from the Hillbrow Boxing Club. Built in what used to be a gas station, the gym has been a haven for many youngsters in this densely populated part of Johannesburg, known for its high poverty and crime rates. After school, local boys flock to the gym to learn the basics of boxing -- how to move, jab and defend. No fee is required as the goal is to keep the young ones off the streets and out of trouble. ""The Hillbrow Boxing Club has done a lot for the community,"" says Mrwebi, whose wins inside the boxing ropes have made her a local star. ""It has saved the community, it has saved Hillbrow,"" she adds. ""Hillbrow is not a good place but this gym has produced a lot of boxers, it has produced a lot of champions. We always go outside to look for younger stars, younger children; we keep them away from drugs; we keep them away from doing wrongs; we keep them away from walking over the street, walking around, don't know what they're looking for. ""We always go outside and look for them; we bring them inside the gym and then we train them."" The club was started by George Khosi, a former boxer who's been with Mrwebi since the very beginning of her career, training her since she was just nine years old. Khosi himself began boxing to avoid a life of crime. By the age of 20 he was fighting professionally across South Africa. Yet his career came to an abrupt end seven years later after a brutal robbery left him with a limp and damaged eye. ""I was very sad,"" recalls Khosi. ""I had no career. I can't do anything when I'm crippled. But God listened to me. He healed me."" His dreams shattered, Khosi realized he would never be able to take part in professional matches again. But if he couldn't box, he could at lease use his skills to train others. Starting Hillbrow Boxing Club, he says, has brought purpose back to his life. And the gym is now also bringing hope to others in the neighborhood. ""I grew up here in Hillbrow,"" says the powerfully built but softly spoken coach. ""I don't want them to be in the street like I was,"" he adds. ""You know sometimes kids, they can get bored ... in the house, so we want them to get out and come here to spend their day. When they get home they are tired. They just sleep. These are big guys. They will forget about doing stupid things outside. They come here and enjoy themselves and then they go home to sleep."" Read this: Playground gets kids back in the swing . Back in the gym, Mrwebi continues her rigorous training regime by pounding a punch bag, her hands wrapped in tape. She says she is determined to work hard to make it far in her own career and also impact the next generation of Hillbrow's boxing hopefuls. ""I'm hoping that one day I'll be a successful boxer, a trainer, a promoter so that I can promote other youngsters,"" she says. ""So that I can put them somewhere so that they cannot suffer like I have suffered. So I'd love one day to be a promoter, to promote other children, to put them somewhere, to make them something one day.""","Hillbrow Boxing Club in Johannesburg has produced champions .

"Rome (CNN) -- One of the 23 Americans whom an Italian court convicted in absentia of kidnapping a terrorism suspect in 2003 has been arrested in Panama on an Italian arrest warrant, the Italian justice ministry's press office said Thursday. The ministry identified the arrested man as Robert Seldon Lady, who Italian prosecutors said had been the CIA base chief in Milan. In a 2009 trial, an Italian court convicted Lady and 22 others of abducting Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, or Abu Omar, from the streets of Milan in 2003. The trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call ""extraordinary rendition."" They say the United States has often transferred terrorism suspects to countries that practice torture. Abu Omar, who was suspected of recruiting men to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and was under heavy surveillance by Italy's intelligence agency, was transferred to Egypt and tortured, Italian prosecutors said. Italian prosecutors said Abu Omar was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian officials. A former senior CIA official said Lady is no longer with the CIA. In the 2009 trial, the Italian court sentenced Lady to eight years in prison, prosecutor Armando Spataro said. The other Americans were sentenced to five years. Each of the 23 Americans was ordered to pay 1 million euros (about $1.3 million) to Abu Omar, plus 500,000 euros to his wife. But at the time, it seemed unlikely that the convictions would have much effect on the Americans, as none appeared at the trial and the Italian government did not ask for their extradition. Washington has acknowledged making secret ""rendition"" transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Robert Seldon Lady was CIA's Milan base chief, prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times published photos of U.S. soldiers posing with what the paper said were bodies of insurgents in Afghanistan. The newspaper said a soldier came forward with the images to draw attention to the safety risk associated with a decline in leadership and discipline. In the Times story, editor Davan Maharaj said publishing the photos ""would fulfill our obligation to readers to report vigorously and impartially on all aspects of the American mission in Afghanistan, including the allegation that the images reflect a breakdown in unit discipline that was endangering U.S. troops."" The Los Angeles Times said efforts to get responses from the soldiers involved were unsuccessful. CNN has not independently authenticated the photos. The images are just the latest in a string of scandals that some say could damage U.S. efforts in the war, which is in its 11th year. In January, video footage emerged of U.S. soldiers apparently urinating on Afghan corpses. In February, Afghans rioted after it was discovered that Qurans had been burned in violation of Islamic custom at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Last month, an Army staff sergeant allegedly went on a rampage and shot to death 17 Afghan civilians, including numerous children. The U.S. is due to hand over control of the country to Afghan forces in 2014. On Thursday Afghan President Hamid Karzai called for an ""accelerated"" transition of security responsibilities to the country's forces. He called the photos ""inhumane and provocative."" CNN spoke with three national security and military experts about the images and what impact they may have on the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Here's an edited version of their responses. Read the complete interviews here . Baer: 'Very, very difficult time stabilizing this country' Robert Baer is a former CIA agent who spent most of his career in the Middle East. His book ""See No Evil"" has been lauded for its first-person look inside the agency and for its analysis of events leading up the war on terror. I think the situation there is going from bad to worse. ... It's incidents like these which are dividing American troops from the Afghans. I just don't see it getting better. Of course, this is an isolated event. It's not the end of the world, but if it continues on like this -- more bad news -- we're going to have a very, very difficult time stabilizing this country before 2014. Getting into one of these wars is very easy. It's very, very difficult for a White House to walk away from this, especially when the same people that attacked us on 9/11 are going to come back. For a politician to say, 'Hey, let's forget about it, let's hope for the best, let's leave' -- this is a problem for the White House. They cannot be seen to be losing a war. It doesn't really matter that we never really won the war. It's just morphed into something else, into a quagmire, guerrilla warfare. I don't think we're going to speed it up, we're just going to hope for the best and get better control of the military. And hope that the Afghans will be able to take this over. I'm not very confident, though. Marks: 'Very damaging to all the U.S. efforts' James ""Spider"" Marks is a retired U.S. Army general. He works as a consultant in Washington. This is very damaging to all the U.S. efforts, specifically the U.S. effort to assure it stays in harness with the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces moving forward in this critically important mission. This does nothing but throw sand into that fabric of trying to establish and trying reinforce what has been, over the last decade, a reasonably good relationship. There's nothing good that comes from this. Sadly, you had soldiers ostensibly dehumanizing the enemy. That can't be done. You've got to hold these bad guys with respect that they deserve if they're willing to kill themselves to achieve a goal ... our soldiers understand this. These are several bad apples. You need to always respect your enemy, so you better understand them. The record of the military in our conflicts, both in Afghanistan and Iraq, and routine activities that take place every day around the globe [have been] decentralized out to young men and women like these folks [in the photos], who sadly made a huge mistake. But most folks -- 99% of our military -- do a magnificent job. So you have to let the record speak for itself. What you have to do locally -- and Gen. John Allen [the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan] understands this intimately -- you have a lot of damage control to do. You have to anticipate what the reaction is going to be in Afghanistan. It speaks to this isolated incident, and it doesn't speak to a full breakdown in terms of morale and discipline and capabilities in our military. ... The military in this case is losing ground because they've achieved so many great things, specifically in Afghanistan, and this incident is setting them back. Clark: 'We'll get an orderly withdrawal' Retired Gen. Wesley Clark served as supreme allied commander of NATO from 1997 to 2000 in the Kosovo war. Once a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University, he has a degree in philosophy, politics and economics, and a master's degree in military science. He served 34 years in the Army and ran in the 2004 presidential election. [The photos don't] represent the standards or the training or the values of the United States armed forces. Our soldiers and our leaders know you don't pose with dead enemy bodies, and there's a lot of other things that you don't do. We maintain these standards. I think the men and women of the armed forces have done a remarkable job, our leadership has done a remarkable job. No one ever expected when this conflict started that we'd be in it [almost] 11 years later, a volunteer army would have held together and done so very well. This is an exception, and I know the military will take their proper measures. We've accomplished our major objective there. We got Osama bin Laden. We've taken strong measures against al Qaeda -- it's a broken organization, at least as it was in 2001. And it's not going to recover, at least not in the near term there. There are other enemies on the ground there in Afghanistan, and it's been a tough fight. So winning the hearts and minds? I think we can continue training Afghan security forces. I think we can expect to fulfill the obligations to Hamid Karzai's government. I think we'll get an orderly withdrawal out of that region, as President Obama said, [in] 2014. That's what we're really looking for. There will be mixed feelings, because those mixed feelings on the ground among the populace are inevitable in wartime. This is a country that's been through 40 years of war. So, there have been a lot of losses, a lot of tragedy, there's been a lot of hatred. This is one more small piece of that.","Experts give opinions about photos allegedly showing soldiers with Afghan corpses .

"(CNN) -- Former world-class boxer Emile Griffith, who won five titles during the 1960s, died Tuesday just east of New York City, the International Boxing Hall of Fame announced. He was 75. Griffith died Tuesday morning at the Nassau Extended Care Facility in Hempstead, New York. ""Emile Griffith was a gifted athlete and a truly great boxer,"" Edward Brophy, the hall of fame's executive director, said. ""Outside of the ring, he was as great a gentleman as he was a fighter."" Born in the Virgin Islands, Griffith was 19 when he moved to New York. His had his first big breakthrough -- a Golden Gloves title -- a few years later in 1957. He went pro the following year. Griffith scored his first of three welterweight titles in 1961. He made headlines the next year for his pummeling of Benny Paret after the latter had called him a maricon, a derogatory Spanish term for homosexual, according to Sports Illustrated and other news reports. Paret died of his injuries 10 days later. A 2005 documentary, ""Ring of Fire,"" recalled that bout and how it haunted Griffith for years. Yet he kept on fighting. By the end of the 1960s -- a decade highlighted by his being named the Boxing Writers Association of America's Fighter of the Year in 1963 -- Griffith had won two middleweight championships in addition to his titles in lighter welterweight division. He retired with a record of 85 wins (including 23 knockouts), 24 losses and two draws, according to the International Boxing Hall of Fame, which inducted him into its ranks in 1990.

"(CNN) -- Virginia Johnson, the pioneering sex researcher who was part of the groundbreaking team Masters and Johnson, has died at age 88, her son, Scott Johnson, told CNN on Wednesday. Johnson died Tuesday morning in St. Louis of natural causes, though she had some complications from heart disease, he said. Dr. William Masters and Johnson conducted the first modern research on sexuality and the treatment of sexual dysfunction that paved the way for the sexual revolution. The pair wrote several books, starting with ""Human Sexual Response"" in 1966, a landmark work discussing the physiology of sex. Their second book, ""Human Sexual Inadequacy,"" published in 1970, detailed how to treat sexual dysfunction. ""The first research on 'sexual response' was unique and surprising,"" Dr. Julia Heiman, director of the Kinsey Institute, said in a statement. ""No one had, with a fairly large number of men and women in a laboratory setting, tried to measure a number of physical responses (heart rate, lubrication, blood pressure, penile and vaginal size charges) during sexual stimulation and orgasm. Opinion: The woman who explained the female orgasm . ""Then the second book, on 'treatment for sexual dysfunctions,' used a very non-medical approach (no drugs, physical aids, or surgery), incorporating behavioral treatments for sexual dysfunctions in men and women. And doing so within two short weeks of daily treatment,"" Heiman said. Johnson never had a degree, other than two honorary doctor of science degrees, her son said. She was working at Washington University's medical school in St. Louis when she met Masters, who was looking for a partner to help conduct his experiments and research. The two shared the work but complemented each other's strengths, Scott Johnson said. Masters. who died in 2001 at age 85, knew what made sense from a scientific perspective and Johnson was able to humanize it, helping their hundreds of subjects get comfortable enough to talk about their problems, and knowing how to address those problems without being cold and impersonal, he said. ""The combination of the two may have been critical for the research to begin, continue and to have the lasting impact it did,"" Heiman said. Thomas Maier, author of ""Masters of Sex: The Life and Times of William Masters and Virginia Johnson, the Couple Who Taught America How to Love,"" now a Showtime TV series, agrees that without Johnson, the research could not have happened. ""She was the one who was able to watch what worked, she was the one who took the background interviews with all the patients,"" he said. ""She put together all of these things and she understood what worked, because she just had a real native genius for understanding what made things click. She was really the brains behind the therapy."" Masters and Johnson developed the practice of sensate focus, which helps couples refocus on each other through emotional skills and body awareness. In sensate focus therapy, sex is removed while the couples reconnect through touching and developing a heightened sense of sexual self awareness, says Ian Kerner, a sexuality counselor who blogs about sex for CNN.com's The Chart. Couples gradually develop a keener understanding of what feels good to their partner, he says. Sensate focus is the basis of sex therapy today, said Linda Weiner, a certified sex therapist in St. Louis who spent five months in the Masters and Johnson training program. ""It's something she invented based on the relaxation she felt as a child when her mother would trace Virginia's face with her fingers to relax her,"" Weiner said. The practice helps couples learn ""how to relax and deal with anxiety and performance, which they discovered was one of the major factors in sexual problems."" Said Kerner: ""Their essential work continues to be debated and appreciated and Virginia Johnson's legacy will always remind us of life before the little blue pill -- when couples solved their sexual problems the old-fashioned way: through communication and loving touch.""

"(WIRED) -- Sergey Brin has once again hit the town with Project Glass -- but this time he let someone else wear Google's augmented reality headset. California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom wore the specs on ""The Gavin Newsom Show,"" and later told Wired about his brief experience with one of the world's most rarefied pieces of technology. ""You can easily forget you have them on, and sense the capacity of use in the future,"" Newsom told us, adding the headset felt incredibly light, comfortable and inconspicuous on his head. Brin and his wife, Anne Wojcicki, appeared on Newsom's Current TV talk show Wednesday May 23 to discuss Project Glass and Sergey's work in the Google X labs. On the show, Brin also provided our first glimpse into how the Google Glass interface is navigated. In the video, Brin navigates the system via a touchpad on the right side of the headset behind the display. He slides his finger forward and back to locate a photo he took of Gavin Newsom with the contraption. He then places the headset on Newsom's face, and continues to navigate until the photo is located. He also tells Newsom, ""Don't touch the pad on the side"" while setting up the headset for the talk show host. Unfortunately for inquiring minds, when Newsom asked how the photo was taken, Brin didn't answer. Newsom told Wired that he was impressed by the image quality of the display in the glasses. The politician-slash-talk-show-host noted that the lighting on his set is less than ideal for demoing a display, but nonetheless the ""image was remarkably clear."" As for interacting with the real world while wearing the glasses, Newsom said he found it easy to quickly focus on Brin and Wojcicki sitting across the desk, and then refocus to the image of himself displayed in the headset's screen. After returning the glasses to his own face, Brin swiped down on the touchpad of the glasses and continued the interview. The down-swipe could possibly be used to exit the photo album he was demoing to Newsom. Whatever the case, Brin's swipes answer questions about how the interface is navigated. Brin told Newsom that he brought a rough prototype. ""I have some hopes to maybe get it out sometime next year,"" he told Newsom, ""but that's still a little bit of a hope."" With this in mind, it's possible that what Newsom demoed on Wednesday could change radically before the final production model hits the market. Nonetheless, even at this early stage, the glasses are impressive, Newsom says. He told Wired that the headset was ""a heck of a lot further along than people have imagined."" The Google co-founder told Newsom that Google X is now his primary focus at Google. His team has been working on the glasses for two to three years, and Brin as been involved for the past year. Brin also explains why Google is working on the technology: ""The idea is that you want to be free to experience the world without futzing with a phone."" One concern with wearable computers is that they're cumbersome wardrobe additions. To this point, Newsom told us that he was surprised by ""how unremarkable the glasses are except for the remarkable feature."" That said, when asked if he would actually wear the glasses himself -- you know, in public -- the lieutenant governor replied, ""I haven't seen the video yet, so I'll withhold judgment until I see myself. I'm hoping this isn't my Dukakis moment."" If you want to watch the full interview, the show airs on Current TV at 11 p.m. ET (8 p.m. PT) on Friday and throughout the weekend.

"(CNN) -- I moved to Lagos earlier this year as CNN's correspondent for West Africa and so far, it's been everything I expected and more. I've lived abroad a good part of my life and I've visited some of the most dynamic cities in the world -- from Sao Paulo to Hong Kong to Dubai -- and I can honestly say that I've never experienced anything as vibrant, exciting and yes, as challenging, as Lagos. Recently, I had the pleasure of filling in for Errol Barnett on CNN's Inside Africa and while batting around show ideas I mentioned that I had been so busy since arriving here that apart from a few dinners, I hadn't really had any time for leisure. It was like a light bulb went off. Why not do a show where I try to find things to do? But not just anything. I would look for activities that I'd really want to do in my spare time -- which granted, I don't have a lot of. It's not always easy to find, but if you know where to look, Lagos offers up almost any activity that you can think of -- golf, sailing and even polo. Read more: 'Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world . But I'm not that much of a golfer and while I like watching polo, I wanted to find more accessible activities. Not one which requires the purchase of a horse. For me, staying active is the key to getting rid of any stress that comes on from work, traffic and the incessant power outages. And as you can see from my Inside Africa show, I am an avid student of the martial arts. I started out learning judo when I was six or seven years old and got hooked on taekwondo in my 20s. In Lagos, when it comes to martial arts, taekwondo -- the way of the hand and foot -- rules. Nigerians really started to get hooked on the art when Chika Chukwumerije won the bronze medal at the 2008 summer Olympics in Beijing. Watch: Taekwondo - 'Nigeria's fastest-growing sport' In Lagos, you'll find most martial artists practicing at Lagos National Stadium in Surulere. That's where I met 7th Dan black belt Ferguson Oluigbo. He's also the president of the Nigeria Taekwondo Referees Association. (+234-803-409-3004). Whether you just want to learn how to defend yourself or stay fit by focusing on the sporting/Olympic aspect, you'll find plenty of opportunities to do so in Lagos. Everyone knows that Lagos has a notorious traffic problem. Whenever we are working on a story in and around Lagos, we always have to factor in the traffic. It can take hours to travel even short distances. I'm still getting used to it but I found a place where I can indulge in my ""need for speed."" GET ARENA is a go-kart race track and the only drivers you'll see are your mates or other patrons that you want to race against. Watch: Go-kart racing in Nigeria . After a workout and cruise around the track, I like to head out in the town with the friends I have met here. If you've heard anything about Lagos it's probably around its killer nightlife. When I started going to some of the nightspots in town, I noticed that everybody -- and I mean everybody, loves to dance. Unfortunately, I seemed to have been born with two left feet and even my Caribbean roots are not enough to get them moving to the rhythm. So I decided to try and learn how to salsa dance. Enter Bunmi -- the dance instructor of the Bailamos Dance Company (33 Moloney Street 1st floor, off Obalende). Trained as a lawyer, she's now following her bliss and teaching both movers and shakers -- and the inept like me. Watch: Changing the perception of dance .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A coroner in Singapore has reaffirmed that American engineer Shane Todd committed suicide -- a ruling that caps a two-month investigation and is at odds with his family's contention that Todd was killed because of his work. Soon after Todd was found hanging from the bathroom door in his Singapore apartment on June 24, 2012, Singapore's medical examiner concluded he had killed himself. But Todd's parents disagreed and hired a pathologist in the United States who -- based on Singapore's autopsy report and photographs of the body -- suggested there was evidence that his death was a homicide. The latest ruling by the coroner sides with the medical examiner's assessment. ""The cause of the deceased's death was asphyxia due to hanging,"" the coroner's report said. ""There was no foul play involved in the deceased's death. The deceased had committed suicide by hanging himself."" In the report, released Monday, state Coroner Chay Yuen Fatt extended his condolences to Todd's family. ""I hope that the family will be able to find closure and I wish them all the best,"" the coroner said. Murdered for his work? The report is the end result of a 10-day hearing into the death last month. In it, Chay said Todd had ""entertained suicidal ideations of overall increasing severity"" in the months leading up to his death. The United States Embassy in Singapore said the inquiry was ""comprehensive, fair, and transparent."" ""The coroner heard testimony from a wide range of witnesses in open court and received evidence in the form of written statements and records,"" it said in a statement Monday. The decision is unlikely to appease Todd's family. CNN was unable to reach them for a reaction early Monday morning. Singaporean lawyers hired by the Todd family have suggested Singapore's police work was sloppy and that an assumption of suicide led police to neglect other evidence. During inquiry proceedings last month, the Todds' lawyers asserted a possible crime scene was altered: Todd's hanging body was cut down and laid on the floor and a nearby chair moved before a forensics team and photographer arrived. Police maintain this follows standard procedure. The 31-year-old Todd had been working for a year and a half at the Singapore government's Institute of Microelectronics (IME) when he decided to quit his job and return home to the United States. He was part of a team researching uses of Gallium Nitride (GaN), a semiconductor that can operate at extremely high temperatures. Documents found on Todd's laptop after his death reportedly indicate IME may have had plans with Chinese telecom giant Huawei to co-develop an amplifier using GaN. Such a device could have both military as well as civilian uses. Todd's parents believe their son may have been murdered over his knowledge of such a sensitive project. They say their son had warned them his life was in danger. Both IME and Huawei deny that any joint GaN project ever went forward. 'Burden to those around me' On the night of June 24, 2012, Todd's girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento, a nurse, discovered his body. She had gone to the apartment after he didn't answer calls or texts. During the court proceedings, Sarmiento testified she didn't know the details of Todd's work but said Todd told her ""how much he hated"" it. On one occasion he told her he was ""working on something that could get him into trouble with the American government"" and that ""heavy hands"" were coming after him, though he didn't elaborate. But Todd had also confided in his girlfriend that he had been depressed since October 2011. But she said he ""did not display any suicidal tendencies."" On his laptop, authorities found a two-page suicide note. ""I am so sorry it has come to this but I feel I am just a burden to those around me. I have tried to get jobs in the U.S. but I know I am not capable of fulfilling the duties required of me,"" he said in one. What led to death? In his report, the coroner says Todd did not possess confidential information from his work at IME and the GaN project did not materialize. ""At the time of his death, the major stressor in the deceased's mind was unlikely to be his workload,"" the coroner said. Todd had already put in his 60-day notice to leave his job and his workload had decreased, . ""Why then would the deceased commit suicide before he was due to return to the US?"" Chay posed in the report. He then hazards some guesses. Todd was concerned he won't be able to get Defense Department clearance for a new job ""because of his perceived involvement in violating US security, the possibility,"" and about his psychiatric condition, Chay wrote. ""These concerns in all likelihood caused him to feel that his deep sense of failure (which was magnified by his psychiatric anxiety) would follow him back to the US,"" the coroner concluded. ""In the deceased's mind, all these factors eventually outweighed the happy prospects of reuniting with his family in the US and culminated in his ultimate decision to take his own life.""","NEW: U.S. Embassy says the inquiry was ""comprehensive, fair, and transparent.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Is President Barack Obama seriously considering pulling all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by next year or is just a sign of his frustration with Afghan President Hamid Karzai? There's no doubt that Obama has had his fill of dealing with Karzai's on-again, off-again negotiations over how many troops would remain in the country after 2014. And there's no doubt that the relationship continues to deteriorate, CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. ""You can talk to senior officials going back into the Bush administration, they would tell you dealing with Karzai is sometimes like dealing with a child -- he's unpredictable, he changes his mind -- so that's part of it,"" King said. ""So If Karzai doesn't trust his own security forces, you lay this down that we might come back to a zero option, maybe you snap him into thinking, '""I'd better get to get back to the negotiating table here,'"" King said. Obama strongly considering complete pullout from Afghanistan . The tough-love approach has become the standard negotiating tactic with Karzai, CNN Foreign Affairs Reporter Elise Labott said. ""They're still hammering out a deal for the long-term U.S. numbers and they know Karzai really doesn't want to be left standing alone."" U.S. and Afghan officials had been discussing a residual force in the country post-2014 to fight insurgents and train Afghan security forces. But the relationship between the two countries soured further last month after the United States and the Taliban planned peace talks and in response, Karzai cut off negotiations. The Pentagon said no decision has been made and talks continue. ""We continue to work through issues,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said, adding, ""We believe we can work through them."" Karzai does hold a bargaining chip in that a complete pullout would put the United States at a strategic disadvantage in a volatile region. Opinion: Abandon Afghanistan? A dumb idea . ""Think about the past decade, look at a map: it's inconceivable to think there wouldn't be some kind of a U.S. residual force in Afghanistan to look across the border to Pakistan,"" King said. ""But remember, for anyone who thinks this is impossible, it is improbable to have zero, but if you think it's impossible, I give you one example: Iraq -- everyone thought we'd leave a force there and we didn't."" The zero option is not without precedent for Obama. The refusal by the Iraqi government to extend legal protections for U.S. troops after the end of the war there was a major reason the American military left the country with no residual military training force. Share your view on Afghanistan . The other part of the equation is Obama's relationship with his generals, King said. ""There's also a big debate about this within the Pentagon. The generals are debating how many troops to leave behind, what's the composition of the force. So the president is also serving notice to the Pentagon here -- 'I'm going to keep the zero option,'"" King said. The Pentagon clearly would like to leave some troops in the country and that has been the plan all along, CNN Senior Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr said. ""But if Karzai won't negotiate an arrangement, then they simply can't stay."" Perhaps the biggest loser in the standoff could be the intelligence community, which would need to keep tabs on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan without the help of U.S. forces on the ground. Logistically, it is possible to get all U.S. troops out of the country by the end of 2014 but those decisions would need to be made now. ""We need to know sooner rather than later,"" a U.S. Army official told CNN. If Obama were to order a complete pullout, then the Army would have to establish schedules for troop withdrawals, shutting down bases, and shipping home equipment over the next 18 months, said an Army official who asked not to be identified because no decisions have been made. It would also change schedules for troop rotations -- the Army is getting to the point that it would need to even out its schedule so that there aren't troops headed to Afghanistan late in 2014 only to come home a few months later, the official said. Ultimately, the United States will make it's decision based on its own national security interests, Labott said. ""They aren't going to make a decision like that based on whether Karzai is more frustrating than usual - especially since they always find him frustrating,"" she said. ""Not having any troops in Afghanistan -- particularly special forces -- adjacent to Pakistan and Iran, among others would put the U.S. at a strategic disadvantage.""","Negotiations between the U.S. and Afghanistan over post-2014 troop levels have deteriorated .

"(CNN) -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is on a three-country tour in Latin America in a bid to build support for U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state, met with the president of El Salvador on Sunday. Salvadorian President Mauricio Funes expressed his support for a Palestinian state and said that he hopes it will soon have a place at the United Nations, according to the president's website. ""We want to strengthen our relationship with Palestine ... and contribute to the reestablishment of talks between Palestine and Israel,"" said Funes. El Salvador recently recognized the Palestinian territories as a ""free, sovereign and independent state,"" the website said. Abbas made the bid for the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state last month, a move Israel says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns. A U.N. committee is expected to issue a report on its analysis of the historic Palestinian bid soon. If a majority of the committee says the prospective Palestinian state fulfills the U.N. charter's requirements, it will send the application back to the full Security Council for a vote. The Palestinians would then need nine of 15 votes in their favor, and no veto from any of the five countries that are permanent members of the Security Council. U.S. officials have vowed to block the measure, though they most likely want to avoid an American veto out of concern over a potential backlash across the Middle East. The General Assembly, however, could still vote to upgrade the status of Palestinians, who currently hold the status of nonvoting observer ""entity."" The body could change that status to permanent observer ""state,"" identical to the Vatican's standing at the United Nations. Abbas' effort to gain U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state is also opposed by Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza. He previously visited the Dominican Republic and is scheduled to wrap up his tour in Colombia this week.

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court Wednesday issued an order blocking the U.S. military from enforcing its ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy on gays and lesbians serving in the military. U.S. officials have been moving ahead with dismantling the policy but had objected to having the courts force the government to officially repeal it at this time. At issue in the complex legal fight is whether ""don't ask, don't tell"" can remain in effect -- even in name only -- while the legal fight over its constitutionality is being fought in the federal courts. Judges have been at odds over the enforcement issue for months. The case puts the Obama administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal, but at the same time filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned. Military officials suggest the policy compliance changes eliminating ""don't ask, don't tell"" could be finished in a few weeks. In a brief order Wednesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals echoed that, saying, ""the process of repealing (the policy) is well underway, and the preponderance of the armed forces are expected to have been trained by mid-summer"" on abiding by the new guidelines. ""The circumstances and balance of hardships have changed,"" said the three-judge panel, concluding that as a result, ""don't ask, don't tell"" cannot remain in place. The Justice Department can now go back to the Supreme Court to try and have the enforcement order suspended for a second time. The justices last fall upheld an earlier order keeping the policy in place. The San Francisco-based appeals court also announced it would hear oral arguments in the issue in late August. A gay rights group -- the Log Cabin Republicans-- had sued over the 18-year-old ban on openly gay and lesbian members from service in the U.S. armed forces. In September, U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips declared the military's ban to be unconstitutional. The Congress has since passed legislation signed by President Obama to gradually eliminate ""don't ask, don't tell,"" but Pentagon officials had refused to issue a timeline on when that policy change would be completed. It is an issue Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who took over the post this month, will now have to confront. If the policy is fully in place, and any current investigations of gay and lesbian service members are suspended, the legal appeals might quickly become moot. But the Log Cabin Republicans have vowed to continue the legal fight until then. The group called the court order ""exciting news."" The ruling ""removes all uncertainty -- American service members are no longer under threat of discharge as the repeal implementation process goes forward,"" said R. Clarke Cooper, the group's executive director. ""As a captain in the United States Army Reserve, I have observed the reactions of my colleagues to the Department of Defense's move toward open service, and can say with complete confidence that our military is ready, willing and able to take this step. Log Cabin Republicans are proud of our role in ending this unconstitutional and un-American policy once and for all."" Obama had said he long wanted to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell,"" and had reached an agreement with then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the previous chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on a process that included a military review of how to make a successful transition to openly gay and lesbian soldiers serving. The three men would then have to certify the repeal. Gay rights groups say the policy -- even as it is being discarded -- violates the due process and First Amendment rights of military members. In their appeals, the Log Cabin Republicans said allowing the policy to remain in effect pending appeal would be unacceptable and would cause ""irreparable harm."" The government presented ""no evidence to support a finding that open service by gay and lesbian individuals harmed the military's interests, and ... both civilian and military leaders admitted that DADT actually impairs military interests,"" the appeal claimed. ""Deference to military judgment here tips the scales against a stay, rather than in favor of one,"" it said. But the Obama administration, supported by Pentagon officials, argued that suspending the policy and forcing the military to immediately change course while the case is being appealed would cause problems during a time of war. ""The military should not be required to suddenly and immediately restructure a major personnel policy that has been in place for years, particularly during a time when the nation is involved in combat operations overseas,"" said the government in a prior legal brief. Pentagon spokesman Dave Lapan said the military ""will of course comply with orders of the court, and are taking immediately steps to inform the field of this order."" He added, ""In the meantime, implementation of the DADT repeal voted by the Congress and signed in to law by the President last December is proceeding smoothly, is well underway, and certification is just weeks away."" Gates last fall raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under ""don't ask, don't tell"" by ordering that it only be done by the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force. In a memo written to the heads of all the military services, Gates said his action was taken in direct response to the legal uncertainty surrounding ""don't ask, don't tell"" law. There have been four voluntary discharges -- all from the Air Force -- in connection with ""don't ask, don't tell"" since October, according to the Pentagon. CNN's Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","A federal appeals court says ""don't ask, don't tell"" cannot remain in place .

"(CNN) -- In tiny Bishop, California, Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, wants to build a museum honoring the mule. Bishop, California, celebrates ""Mule Days"" every Memorial Day weekend. McKeon has requested a $50,000 earmark to explore the possibility of building a museum in the town that every Memorial Day weekend holds the biggest mule celebration in the United States. It might sound preposterous, but McKeon is doing what many of his House colleagues are doing -- appropriating federal funds for pet projects back home. McKeon has requested funds for studying the feasibility of building the museum and providing support for operations. McKeon defended the earmark in a statement sent to CNN as supporting economic development in his district. ""Bishop is a classic western frontier city which survives on tourism. Adding a museum to its community will increase tourism by bringing sightseers and visitors to Bishop year-round, benefiting the area economy,"" McKeon's statement said. ""If CNN chooses to make a mockery of small-town, western heritage, that's its prerogative, but I'm going to remain focused on the economic development of my district."" According to congressional spending watchdog group Americans for Prosperity, House members this year alone seek to spend $13.7 million in tax dollars on 63 museum-related expenses. And the requests aren't limited to one party. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, whom critics often call the ""King of Pork,"" has asked for $150,000 to restore the W.A. Young and Sons Foundry to a ""key historic property,"" according to a description posted on Murtha's Web site.  Watch why taxpayers might be paying for a mule museum » . The Rices Landing foundry in Murtha's economically distressed district is right next to Gary Smith's home. Smith parks his car in front of the building because as he says ""they got a tour in there [only] once a year."" Murtha declined to talk to CNN about his earmark requests. That is not uncommon. Earlier this year, CNN asked House members to disclose their earmarks. Of the more than 430 members, 47 provided earmark requests, 68 said they would not release their requests and six said they had not made any requests. The others did not return CNN's request for a list of their earmarks. Earmarks have been a political hot button for years. Commonly derided as ""pork,"" pet projects are tucked into spending bills. In 2006, Congress approved a record $29 billion in earmarks. Watchdog groups, citizens and the media have tried to figure out which members of Congress were asking for money to fund pet projects. When Democrats swept into power in January, they vowed a more ethical, open and transparent government. Earmark reform was at the top of the list. But the party leaders have struggled to make the earmark process more transparent. Democrats have agreed to attach names to earmarks -- letting the public know which representative is asking for what -- before votes on bills. That will be a first, and Democrats have touted the move as a sign of their openness. But there is no law or rule that requires senators or members of Congress to release their requests. In his statement, McKeon called himself a ""staunch supporter of earmark transparency and accountability."" ""A light needs to be shined on the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars spent on 'bridges to nowhere' and projects that serve no real purpose, unlike our community museum request,"" McKeon said. ""I do not shy away from, nor do I take any issue with, the public knowing that federal dollars went to support the economic development of a small town on the western edge of the country."" McKeon's and Murtha's requests come at a time when Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the Republican minority leader, is trying to force reforms in how congressional members ask for and receive funding for pet projects. Boehner is gathering signatures in hopes of forcing a vote to make public every earmark in every bill. Boehner said it would be unreasonable to force a vote on each of the 16,000 expected earmarks Congress will approve in this year's spending bills. But he said some amount of exposure will cut down on the more outrageous requests. Boehner recently wrote an editorial urging his fellow Republicans to return to their fiscally conservative roots and stop asking for so many pork-barrel projects. But he admits he has limited power, even among fellow Republicans. ""I'm elected to be their leader,"" Boehner said. ""I'm not elected to be their dictator or lay out all the rules. All I can do is lead by example. I've never asked for one [earmark]. I think there's an incredible amount of waste. I'm doing my best to control it."" Democratic House leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the Appropriations Committee chairman, declined to answer questions concerning earmark funding.

"Durban, South Africa (CNN) -- For centuries, the massive sand dunes overlooking the warm waters off the South African east coast have created a majestic scenery, acting as a natural wall between the sea and the land environment. Lashed by strong winds, the imposing dunes tower above the acacia-dotted landscape, supporting a vibrant ecosystem that thrives along the scenic coastline near the city of Durban. In recent years, mining companies have been eager to dig inside these dunes to extract the valuable minerals they contain. At the same time, environmentalists have been campaigning against mining, fighting to keep the dunes pristine and preserve the region's splendid natural habitat. Watch: Investing in Africa's mining sector . One mining company operating in the area is Richards Bay Minerals (RBM). The firm has been extracting minerals from the region's coastal sand dunes for more than three decades, having set up a massive operation along the shore. ""These sands are mineralized,"" says Andrew Denton, general manager of mining at RBM. ""They've got a total heavy mineral content in them, which is ilmenite, rutile, zircon,"" he explains. While carrying its mining operations, the company says it is committed to achieving a high standard of environmental care. It has put in place a rehabilitation program that aims to reshape the dunes and bring the forest to its pre-mining state by putting the indigenous plants back into the ground after the extraction process. ""Clearly, this [mining] is a large scale operation that's got significant impact,"" says Denton. ""What's important to us is that we can rehabilitate the ground, restore the indigenous forest after we mined it and that the communities around us and the society which we operate receive benefits from being in proximity to this mining area. That's key to our operation."" According to RBM, the minerals removed from the sand through mining comprise about 5% of the dunes' total volume. The company stockpiles the topsoil which contains the nutrients, organic debris and plant seeds that are stripped away during mining. After the dunes are reshaped, the topsoil is spread over the bare sand in a thin layer, triggering the natural processes that facilitate the recovery of the dunes. Windbreaks are erected to protect the emerging seedlings from damage and to help in the stabilization of the dune. Read more: Romancing the dune in Namibia . Michelle Boshoff, the company's environmental manager, describes the procedure as a natural restoration process that takes decades to be finalized. She says the program is being followed by a number of stakeholders, including the University of Pretoria which conducts studies in the area. ""There's a way to lessen the impact and do mining and development side by side,"" she says. ""We can prove it [natural restoration] is viable. It's a good option."" Yet, dune mining is being staunchly opposed by many environmentalists who say that the process is damaging the region's ecosystem. Environmental lawyer Jeremy Ridl is part of a group of eco-activists who successfully blocked dune mining in the area of St. Lucia -- north of where RBM is currently working -- in the 1990s. That area is now a world heritage site. Ridl describes mining operations in the region as ""completely destructive."" ""It's a major change to the landscape,"" he says. ""The vegetation gets cleared. Then anything up to 80 meters of dune gets completely mangled up and rehashed. They put humpty dumpty back together again and you have this sort of consolation that the shape will be the same."" Yet, even critics such as Ridl acknowledge that there are benefits stemming from the post-mining efforts to rehabilitate the ecosystem. Watch: Growing cost of mining gold in Africa . ""I've got no complaints about that,"" he says. ""Not only are they trying very hard, they are producing excellent results, but in my mind it's too early to proclaim this as a rehabilitation of the dunes back to its natural state."" Some voices argue that eco-tourism could provide a small but possible alternative to mining, helping local communities generate income and also preserve the ecosystem. Ridl says that eco-tourism has the potential to benefit the area but warns that its development should take into consideration the sensitivity of the local environment. ""We need to think ahead -- if we're promoting eco-tourism as an opportunity and form of development, then we've got to apply all the same controls and look at it critically, like the mining operation,"" he says. ""Eco-tourism does have the advantage provided its beneficiaries are local. Now I'm talking about everybody -- owners of resorts, people employed, skills development is very important because these tourism ventures are located in areas where people lack capacity and skills. ""So unless you link tourism in other community-based initiatives and end up having these ventures and all the benefits living in community, eco-tourism has potential to be just as bad as we perceive mining to be.""","South Africa's sand dunes have been supporting a thriving ecosystem for centuries .

"(CNN) -- Not just your basic, average everyday, ordinary, run-of-the-mill, ho-hum fairy tale, ""Stardust"" is a dazzler very nearly from first to last, a live action film that rivals the best recent animated features for imagination and wit. Claire Danes and Charlie Cox star in the imaginative ""Stardust."" Indeed, at a pinch you might describe it as ""Shrek"" for grown-ups --- though I've a suspicion the great Japanese filmmaker Hiyao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away"") may have been a more important inspiration. The movie combines many of the archetypes of a classic bedtime story. First, there's Tristran (Charlie Cox), an intrepid young hero from the wrong side of the tracks (or so he thinks), embarking on a romantic quest to bring back a fallen star as a token of his love for beautiful, aloof Victoria (Sienna Miller). This quest takes him from an English village -- ""Wall"" -- into another land, Stormhold, a magical realm where the star in question has transformed into Yvaine (Claire Danes). She's blonde and grumpy, but obviously a better bet than you-know-who -- if only Tristran would stop mooning over the girl he left behind. Stormhold is home to a rapidly dwindling family of fratricidal princes vying for the throne. The last men standing, Septimus and Primus (Mark Strong and Jason Flemyng) are also after the star, glumly observed from the monochromatic sidelines by their five murdered brothers. Then there's the wicked witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her two evil sisters. Their magic is on the wane, but a fresh injection of stardust will restore their youth and vitality. Lamia means to intercept Yvaine, pluck out her heart and eat it raw. Fava beans apparently are optional. Adapted from Neil Gaiman's novel by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn, ""Stardust"" gets off to a false start with a prologue told in such broad strokes it comes off as crude and supercilious, even with no less a personage than Sir Ian McKellen narrating. But this richly plotted, thumpingly scored story settles into a groove as soon as Yvaine enters the picture and the chase is on. Cut from the same slightly damp cloth as Orlando Bloom, Charlie Cox is dashing and bumbling in roughly equal measure -- a quintessentially English combination that will either have you swooning or groaning. As usual, Claire Danes radiates intelligence, but struggles with the naiveté required to offset her character's crankiness. Whatever you make of the young folk, there's no question that the real star power emanates from a delectably witchy Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro, very droll as a pirate captain by the name of Shakespeare who has a surprising skeleton in his closet. It's also the case that they have the best props. Apparently having the time of her life at 48 (she's already been a hoot in ""Hairspray""), Pfeiffer clearly savors playing a woman who ages another notch with every spell she casts. De Niro, for his part, mans the helm of an airship that's part galleon, part zeppelin, and he smuggles lightning bolts for a living. This elaborate strain of fantasy meshes easily enough with a cheeky, Monty Pythonish sense of humor, even if the mild ribaldry makes it a questionable proposition for kids.

"(CNN) -- The last of more than 12,000 California prison inmates who were on a hunger strike ended their protest Thursday morning, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. Inmates in several prisons were demanding an end to long-term solitary confinement and a halt to what is known as the ""debriefing"" policy, in which inmates are required to provide information on prison gangs to get out of solitary. The Corrections Department issued a statement saying all the hunger strikers were taking state-issued meals and that the department will ""continue to implement the substantive reforms in California's Security Housing Units that we initiated two years ago."" Prisoners on solitary confinement are held in the security housing units. In July, the department said more than 300 inmates had either been transferred from those units back to the general population or were taking part in a program to gradually return them there. California governor seeks $315 million for prison fix . The hunger strikers had other demands, including warmer clothing, better mattresses and better food. The statement from officials did not say if there were any changes in those areas. As of Wednesday, there were 100 inmates on hunger strike. Forty of those had been on strike since the start of the protest, on July 8, Corrections Department spokeswoman Dana Simas said. The other 60 had joined at various times. The strike's leaders were in the maximum-security prison at Pelican Bay, near the Oregon state line, but inmates in other lockups were encouraged to add their own demands. The department said it was pleased that the strike was called off before any inmates became seriously ill.","Some California inmates had been on hunger strike since July .

"(CNN) -- The newly elected head of Syria's opposition briefed European foreign ministers Monday on the crisis there, European Union foreign affairs representative Catherine Ashton said. Ashton met Monday with Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib and pledged European support ahead of the monthly meeting of European Union foreign ministers. ""We want to help, but it's their country,"" she said. Al-Khatib was to discuss his proposal for a political transition to end the hostilities that have left thousands of people dead during nearly 21 months of violence that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has characterized as a fight against terrorism. Ashton said the world must take a stand against al-Assad's actions. ""It is important that we recognize the terrible things that have been happening in Syria and the responsibility that Assad has,"" Ashton said. ""We said from the very beginning that it is no place to be in a position of power in your country if you respond to peaceful demonstrations with the murder of your citizens."" After hearing from al-Khatib, the foreign ministers released a statement saying, ""The EU is seriously concerned about the potential use and transfer of chemical weapons in Syria and reminds the Syrian regime and other parties that, in case of their use, those responsible will be held accountable."" Syria has accused the United States of working to falsely accuse the country of using chemical weapons, Syrian state-run media said Monday. ""The U.S. administration has consistently worked over the past year to launch a campaign of allegations on the possibility that Syria could use chemical weapons during the current crisis,"" the Foreign Ministry wrote in letters to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. ""What raises concerns about this news circulated by the media is our serious fear that some of the countries backing terrorism and terrorists might provide the armed terrorist groups with chemical weapons and claim that it was the Syrian government that used the weapons,"" SANA quoted the letters as saying. U.S. officials have said they have seen intelligence suggesting that Syrian military units may be preparing chemical weapons for use. President Barack Obama has said any use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line,"" eliciting swift U.S. reaction. The United States and European allies are using defense contractors to train Syrian rebels to secure chemical weapons stockpiles, a senior U.S. official and several senior diplomats said. The training, in Jordan and Turkey, covers the monitoring and securing of stockpiles of weapons and materials, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the issue. Some contractors are working with rebels in Syria to monitor sites, one of the officials said. Opposition groups said fighting continued Monday across the country. At least 142 people died Monday, 59 of them in Aleppo and 50 in Damascus and its suburbs, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. In one Aleppo neighborhood, opposition activists said, they discovered 10 handcuffed and blindfolded corpses killed by government forces in recent weeks, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. CNN is unable to confirm casualty reports as the government has severely restricted access by international journalists. The Observatory said a rebel group seized control of a government military base in northwest Syria. The seizure occurred in Aleppo province, where rebel fighters from the jihadi al-Nusra Front, Muhikiri al-Sham and the al-Battar battalions took over three brigades and the command center of the 111th regiment in the Sheikh Sleiman area of western Reef Aleppo, the observatory said. Two rebels and one soldier died; five other soldiers were captured, it said, adding that 140 soldiers and their officers fled. The rebel forces represent a variety of interests. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Monday that U.S. officials were concerned ""that al-Nusra is little more than a front for al Qaeda in Iraq who has moved some of its operations into Syria."" The State Department is planning to designate al-Nusra Front, a radical Islamist group, as a foreign terrorist organization, two U.S. officials told CNN last week. The announcement is likely to come this week, the officials said. The hope is to finalize the designation before the Friends of Syria meeting, which is slated to be held Wednesday in Morocco. The goal of the designation is to isolate extremists groups in Syria while giving a boost to the new political opposition group unveiled last month in Doha, Qatar, they said. Al-Nusra and several other groups announced their opposition to a new anti-government coalition last month. U.S. officials estimate al-Nusra members represent some 9% of rebel forces in Syria. Officials said the group has not affiliated itself publicly with al Qaeda in an apparent effort to appear more mainstream. In recent months, the al-Nusra Front has emerged as one of the most effective groups in the Syrian resistance, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. It has claimed responsibility for a number of complex attacks in Damascus and Aleppo, frequently involving suicide bombers.

"(CNN) -- Fire Lt. Dave Monteverdi had just finished another call at San Francisco International Airport when the call came crackling over his radio. ""Alert 3. Plane crash."" Still in his turnout gear, Monteverdi looked out the terminal window, and what he saw gave him a start. ""All you could see across the airfield was dark smoke rising into the sky,"" he said. It was just moments after Asiana Airlines Flight 214 had clipped the seawall on the bayside airport's runway, tumbling to a violent stop Saturday. Monteverdi was among a small army of fire and police responders who would race to what many referred to in a Monday news conference as a surreal scene they had never expected to see. Among them was police Officer Jim Cunningham, who was on a routine welfare check at an aircraft terminal when he heard the call. He raced outside to see the tower of smoke rising, hailed a nearby ambulance and told its driver to follow him. And at the fire department's airport station, sardonically nicknamed the ""Crash House,"" Lt. Chrissy Emmons' adrenaline began to flow as soon as she heard the tower dispatcher's call. ""I knew from her voice that the event we were going to was real,"" he said. She and her driver hopped into the cab of Rescue 88 and began racing toward the scene. As they approached the crash site, they saw a large column of smoke, fire coming from one of the stricken plane's engines and jet fuel streaming from the wing. Passengers were milling around outside the airplane, some of them even heading back to retrieve luggage. As Cunningham and fellow officers worked to herd passengers away from the burning, leaking plane, Monteverdi dashed up the escape chute to search for stragglers. Emmons wasn't far behind. ""I said, 'If he can do it, I can do it',"" she said. Another firefighter followed. While Monteverdi headed for the cockpit, Emmons and another firefighter probed the inside of the dark, smoky and eerily quiet interior of the broken Boeing 777, looking for passengers to rescue, knocking down flames as they went. As they approached the rear of the plane, they found wounded passengers, some of them stuck. About this same time, Cunningham clawed his way up into the airplane through the broken tail section to help firefighters, drawing praise from rescue workers for braving the danger with no protective gear. Cunningham's boss, Gaetano Caltagirone, followed Cunningham aboard the airplane to see him tossing seats and luggage to make room to help passengers get off the plane. ""So much chaos going on, and it was quiet,"" he said. ""Everybody was doing what they were trained to do, save lives."" The amazing memories may end up being marred by one incident. Assistant Fire Chief Dale Carnes said it's possible that one of the fire department's vehicles that responded to the crash may have ""contacted"" one of the teenage girls who died in the crash. Authorities found the two girls on the tarmac, but it's not clear if the they died in the crash, or later, or even if a fire vehicle hit one of them. ""At this time because we have not clearly defined and established those facts, we cannot answer your questions,"" Carnes said Monday. The incident is under investigation, he said.","""All you could see ... was dark smoke,"" firefighter recounts .

"(CNN) -- A joint operation between police from China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand has resulted in 2,534 arrests during a two-month anti-drug campaign along the Mekong River, reported Chinese state media Xinhua. The operation, named ""Safe River,"" has led to 9.78 tonnes of drugs being seized, along with 38 firearms, $3.6 million and 260 tonnes of precursor chemicals, Liu Yuejin, director general of the Ministry of Public Security's Narcotics Control Bureau told a press conference . Liu said 1,784 drug-related cases were solved during the campaign, which ran from April 20 to June 20, the news agency reported. The Mekong River runs through China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam -- including southeast Asia's Golden Triangle region, one of the world's major drug-producing areas -- forming a major trade route in the region. Xinhua previously reported that one raid, conducted by China and Myanmar police on May 12, busted a Myanmarese ring engaged in smuggling methamphetamine into China, while another series of busts in China's Yunnan and Hunan provinces saw the arrest of 35 involved in importing drugs from foreign countries for distribution in China. In March, China executed four foreign drug traffickers who had been convicted of murdering 13 Chinese sailors along a stretch of the Mekong in northern Thailand in 2011, state media reported. Thai authorities discovered the gruesome murder scene in October 2011, after boarding two cargo ships, the Hua Ping and Yu Xing 8, that had come under gunfire. They found 12 dead bodies, some with their hands bound. One sailor was missing. Chinese authorities identified one of the convicted men as a Myanmar drug lord named Naw Kham, with the other three -- believed to be members of his gang -- named as Hsang Kham from Thailand, Yi Lai, referred to as ""stateless,"" and Zha Xika, a Laotian, Xinhua reported. The agency reported that Kham was nicknamed as ""the Godfather,"" saying that his was ""the largest armed drug trafficking gang on the Mekong River."" In an interview from his prison cell with state broadcaster CCTV, Kham appeared to express regret about his past. ""The Golden Triangle area is a place of evil,"" he said, referring to area that overlaps the mountains of Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. ""It turns good people bad. ""People come here doing business, but they couldn't resist the temptation of drugs, then they become drug dealers too.""

"(CNN) -- Despite overtures from Turkey, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said Sunday that his country will not apologize to Turkey over the deaths of nine Turkish activists aboard an aid flotilla headed for Gaza in May. ""The ones who need to apologize is the Turkish government for supporting terror regarding the IHH (a Turkish charity tied to the flotilla), Hamas and Hezbollah,"" he told a gathering of Israeli ambassadors from around the world. ""There will be no apology, and if there is one, we are expecting it from Ankara and not vice versa,"" he added. A day earlier, Turkey's foreign minister continued to press for an apology from Israel over the incident, as the boat that set off the row between the two countries was scheduled to arrive in Istanbul. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu criticized Israel for not reciprocating his country's efforts to remedy relations, despite Turkey's ""wish to reconcile with Israel,"" according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. ""We are having difficulty, when we don't receive the same will from the other side,"" he said. ""If our friendship with Israel is going to continue, an apology and compensation are the only possible ways for it."" Turkey was once Israel's strongest ally among Muslim nations, but the relationship between the two nations has been chilly since May 31, when Israeli forces intercepted an aid flotilla headed to Gaza from Turkey. Violence broke out, and nine Turkish activists were killed. Tens of thousands of people were expected Sunday to greet the boat at the center of the controversy, the Mavi Marmara, upon its arrival in Istanbul, according to a press release from Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief. Israel has maintained that its troops used force on the activists only after they were attacked by those on board one boat. But passengers on board insist Israeli troops fired on them without provocation. On Saturday, Davutoglu said that Tel Aviv's attempts to lay blame were unfounded. ""Turkish citizens were killed in international waters,"" he told reporters, according to the Anadolu report. ""Nothing can cover this fact. Turkey cannot be blamed."" In September, the U.N. Human Rights Council concluded that Israeli forces committed serious violations of international law in the mid-sea interception. The 56-page report described the circumstances of the deaths of ""at least six of the passengers"" as being ""consistent with ... an arbitrary and summary execution."" Officials from Israel and Turkey met earlier this month in Geneva, Switzerland, in an attempt to reduce tensions. That meeting came days after Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan sent two firefighting planes to Israel to help combat a deadly wildfire, according to a Turkish foreign ministry official. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly thanked Erdogan, then called him to thank him again, the official said. While on the telephone, Netanyahu said he hoped the two countries could discuss the state of their relationship in a different context.

"(CNN) -- With less than 48 hours to go before our Fit Nation team tackles its first triathlon in Malibu, California, we asked them to reflect on the past nine months of training. Here are the top five lessons they learned: . Like riding a bike, sometimes in life you just have to let go. Learning to ride the bike was the toughest challenge I had on this journey. Every ride I had until the midway trip in Florida was full of fear and white knuckles. I couldn't make myself lay off the brakes coming down hills, so it made it very hard to climb back up. But on the midway trip, Coach April got inside my head and heart. During a bike ride, she said, ""I want you to know you deserve this -- all the time and work you've put into this. It's worth it; all you have to do is let go and take it."" Like braking on a bike, I was holding on too tightly to people, words and situations that had hurt me and to worries about things I have absolutely no control over. So write down everything you are holding on to that is preventing you from living the life you deserve. You aren't writing them down to dwell on them; you are writing them down to get them out of your heart and off your mind. Here's mine: ""I am not defined by the scars of my past. It is up to me to define who I am now and who I will become. The only person I can save is myself. When I find it difficult to accept what I have no control over, I will let go and trust in God to guide me."" -- Annette Miller . Giving up is not an option. Life is never going to stop. The ups and downs of being a human being on God's green Earth are going to continue whether we like it or not. Both honeymoons and valleys are undoubtedly going to greet you along the way. Don't get me wrong; being on the Fit Nation team has been an awesome experience. But it has also proved to be much harder than I ever expected. I've fallen so many times, and in so many ways, yet I'm not giving up on my goal of crossing the finish line in Malibu. Whether it's mental or physical, remind yourself that giving up is not an option. Getting to the finish line, regardless of your race, may not be pretty or perfect, but I promise that you'll get there. Just keep picking yourself up when you fall. -- Douglas Mogle . You can't go wrong following your passion. Little did I know how triathlon training would permeate my life. I didn't notice it at first; I was too preoccupied with anxiety and fear about the journey upon which I was embarking. Still mired in self-doubt and comparing myself to those around me, I was worried that I wouldn't be enough. Fast enough. Strong enough. Disciplined enough. But little by little, my attitude shifted. Physical feats I didn't think possible became daily routines. Incrementally, my body and my mind became stronger. I became comfortable in my imperfect body, realizing its value lies not in how others view it or the clothes I use to dress it but rather in the places it can take me. Others noticed this change too. Friends, family and co-workers remarked that I looked good, looked healthy, looked happy. And I was all of those things and more. I imagine the same happens when an artist picks up a paintbrush, a dancer learns her first moves or a writer finishes a manuscript. The pleasure in following your heart and working hard to achieve a goal you see so vividly is infectious. Whether it's sport, art, music or any number of things, you can't go wrong with following your passion. You'll soon find your inner joy burning so brightly that others will be drawn to your light. -- Tabitha McMahon . Keep moving forward. During the first few weeks, I was completely overwhelmed -- from making time to work out to improving my diet to learning how to operate the new electronic devices we used to track our mileage. So many times, I wondered if I was in over my head and if I really had what it was going to take to do a triathlon in nine short months. Luckily, all I had to do was look at my right wrist, where a silver band with the words ""Keep moving forward"" reminded me that I didn't need to conquer everything at once; I just needed to take one small step in the right direction in order to keep moving toward my goal. It is hard for me to put into words how much strength and determination this simple mantra provides me with each and every day. As I have dealt with tragedies, emergencies and the everyday ups and downs of life, it reminded me that a simple step, no matter how small forward, meant I was moving in the right direction. This time next week, the event that I have trained for and looked forward to since January will be a memory. My fears and anxiety have been replaced with pride and excitement. I know that for the rest of my life, I will continue to keep moving forward, one step at a time. -- Rae Timme . Invite others into your world . The reason I am here, feeling well-prepared to start and finish in Malibu, is because of the incredible support I've gotten from my teammates, my family, my friends and even strangers who have followed my progress. If I had attempted this triathlon thing on my own, I'm not sure that I would have made it. In fact, I know I would have stopped swimming out of pure frustration. But the encouragement and advice that everyone has given to me has carried me through to this point. We think of triathlon as an individual pursuit, and we do run the races alone. But we didn't get to those races alone. We got there as a team. My team has carried me through, and I'm proud to say that because of all of you, I am ready to be a triathlete. My most import lesson I've learned is to invite people into your world, allow them to become part of your journey and accept their shoulder for support when you need it. They'll help you achieve your goals. -- Stacy Mantooth . Follow @CNNFitNation on Twitter and Facebook .","CNN Fit Nation team is in Malibu, California, to race their first triathlon .

"(CNN) -- For passing hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. government documents to WikiLeaks, Pfc. Bradley Manning has been found guilty of violating the Espionage Act, but he was acquitted on the most serious charge of ""aiding the enemy,"" a capital offense. Has justice been done? In some quarters in the United States the question remains a burning one, and even more so in Europe where a movement of supporters has been active in his defense, decrying the conditions under which he was imprisoned while awaiting trial in a Quantico brig, and generally arguing that Manning is a whistleblower who they believe has done nothing more than expose American wrongdoing in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world. It's true that for a period of time, Manning was held in less than humane conditions for reasons that have never been convincingly justified. And there is no question that some good came out his revelations. After all, some of the documents he revealed about Tunisia, Bahrain and Egypt may well have helped to ignite the initial hopeful phase of the Arab Spring. More generally, it is hard to argue that we are not all better informed by our ability to pore through hundreds of thousands of documents detailing the inner workings of American foreign policy. But such benefits are completely beside the point. The United States, like every country, depends to a significant degree on secrecy in conducting diplomacy and defending itself in a dangerous world. But we are also a democracy. Our procedures for determining what should be kept secret and what should not have been developed by institutions that, whatever their flaws, are under the people's control, funded and overseen by the people's representatives in Congress and directed by an elected president. In a democracy, individual soldiers cannot be permitted to make decisions with such far-reaching consequences. When they do take such decisions into their own hands, they are trampling on the workings of a democracy and usurping a power that properly belongs to the American people. This is something that Manning himself seemed to recognize when he pleaded guilty to a series of lesser charges earlier this year. Pressed by the judge on that occasion about how he reconciled his claim of doing something positive with his acknowledgment of wrongdoing, Manning explained, ""Your honor, regardless of my opinion or my assessment of documents such as these, it's beyond my pay grade -- it's not my authority to make these decisions."" Manning was right. And he was also right on that occasion to accept the legal consequences of his actions. In that respect, he has been more consistent than many of his supporters, who have continued to profess his innocence and acclaim him as a hero even after Manning himself pleaded guilty and acknowledged serious wrongdoing. Some of those same supporters, perhaps because their agenda is not really governmental transparency but blackening the name of the United States, are eager to ignore the high costs of Manning's actions. In a typical vein, one such supporter, Chris Hedges, formerly a reporter for The New York Times and now an activist at the Nation Institute, complains that Manning has been muzzled from talking about ""crimes, torture and killing"" committed by the United States and that the conditions under which he has been prosecuted, ""familiar to many Muslim Americans tried in the so-called war on terror, presage a future of show trials and blind obedience."" Those spewing such left-wing anti-Americanism are eager to pass over the fact that many of the documents Manning passed to WikiLeaks were dropped onto the Internet by Julian Assange and contained the names of individuals around the world who had met with American diplomats or cooperated with American forces. Some of these individuals were simply innocent civilians in places like Iraq and Afghanistan who tried to help our soldiers. Others were dissidents and underground writers in repressive countries. Through Manning's actions, the lives of every one of these individuals was placed at risk. Just to take one example of many, back in 2011 the Globe and Mail reported that leading Chinese academics and human rights campaigners were ""attacked as 'rats' and 'spies' after their names were revealed as U.S. Embassy sources in the unredacted WikiLeaks cables that have now been posted online."" Among other things, the real names of a number of Chinese bloggers, previously only known by their screen names, were contained in some of the cables that Manning distributed. The Globe and Mail report comments: ""The repercussions could indeed be dire in some circumstances, particularly for Tibetan and Uighur activists exposed as having passed information to Washington."" Is this kind of exposure the work of a legitimate whistleblower? The indiscriminate mass leaking that Manning engaged in was recklessness of a high order. However much one wants to temper justice with mercy when a young person commits a crime, it is Manning's recklessness that demands he face a harsh sentence. By the same token, it is right that Manning was acquitted of the charge of ""aiding the enemy."" His crime did not aim so much at giving enemies an advantage as injuring the United States. Our government is acting fully within its rights and with justice on its side when it punishes someone who betrays his oath, abuses his position of responsibility in a way that weakens our country and imperils friends and allies around the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gabriel Schoenfeld.","Gabriel Schoenfeld: Manning admitted guilt, unlike supporters who call him innocent .
True, he was held in inhumane conditions, may have helped Arab Spring, he says .
But he put many in grave danger, and his supporters are interested in blackening U.S.
It was not his decision to release material, he trampled on a democracy by doing it ."
"(CNN) -- Sporting an all-black racing suit, Bubacarr Jallow kneels next to his bright red motorcycle to check its oil levels and make sure the nuts and bolts are tightened properly. Satisfied, he hops on his Yamaha AG100 and hits the bumpy dirt road, weaving his way through rugged tracks and treacherous terrain. Being able to ride along narrow trails and carry out maintenance checks on a motorbike are not talents most health workers in the world need to possess, but for Jallow these skills are crucial. As a community health nurse, he relies on his two-wheeled companion to reach the isolated villages dotting the Combo Central region in The Gambia, West Africa. In an area where lack of roads and unreliable transport would typically force patients to spend several hours reaching the nearest clinic on foot or by bicycle, Jallow's durable bike allows him to navigate through the bush to deliver life-saving treatment and health advice to rural communities. Armed with a medical kit, his routine motorbike round includes visits to at-risk pregnant women and malnourished children. He checks them for any warning signs and, if needed, refers them to the nearest health center. He also distributes mosquito bed nets and food supplements and educates locals about life-threatening diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS. Jallow says all this wouldn't be possible without Riders for Health (RFH), a social enterprise working to transform healthcare delivery across rural Africa and provide outreach health workers with the transport they need. The UK-based group says it manages a fleet of more than 1,400 motorcycles, ambulances and other trekking vehicles in seven African countries, reaching about 12 million people. It trains African health workers to drive safely on difficult terrain and teaches them how to carry out simple maintenance checks on their vehicles on a daily basis. In addition, it ensures that there is a reliable supply chain of spare parts, while a network of local RFH-employed technicians services all bikes and cars monthly to make sure they don't break down. ""I received this motorcycle four years ago when it was brand new and I have ridden until now over 50,000 kilometers,"" says Jallow, whose work covers more than 10,000 people in 13 villages. ""Since I got my motorcycle I have been getting my regular supply of fuel and my motorcycle is being serviced regularly,"" he adds. ""All of this is towards my services within my community within the past four years, so actually it [RFH] has contributed immensely towards the successful implementation of my activities within my circuit."" Millions of lives are lost needlessly every year from easily preventable and treatable diseases across sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that some 12,000 children in the continent die daily from illnesses and conditions such as pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, malaria and malnutrition. In many cases, the vaccines and medicines required for treatment are available but fail to reach the millions of people in need due to unreliable transport. That's what prompted British racing journalist Barry Coleman and his wife Andrea to put RFH together. It all began after Barry visited Somalia in the late 1980s, where he observed scores of new-looking motorbikes and other vehicles lying broken because of poor maintenance. At the same time, he saw first hand the risks posed to mothers and children due to failed healthcare delivery. ""Barry came back and said there are children in rural communities who really need to be reached because they need immunizations; women are dying in childbirth and then 30, 20, 10 miles away in ministry of health car parks there are motorcycles and ambulances that are simply broken because nobody has been trained to repair them, there's no supply chain of parts, there's no knowledge of transport maintenance,"" remembers Andrea, a mother of three and former motorcycle racer. ""We said, well, we've got a young family, we've got a mortgage but we really believe in this,"" she adds. ""It made us angry, actually, that women and children are dying in rural Africa simply because an old technology like a motorcycle or an ambulance with this internal combustion engine can't be managed -- well, that's ridiculous, that is crazy."" The two life-long motorcycle enthusiasts made several more trips to Africa and eventually founded RFH in 1996. The award-winning group, which today has some 300 staff across Africa, raises funds at bike events and auctions as well as from charging the governments, agencies and NGOs it works with a not-for-profit fee for its services. RFH says its work has enabled outreach health professionals to see nearly six times more people and spend double the time with their patients. They can also hold about 3,500 extra health-education meetings a month across the continent. Moreover, the group has introduced a motorcycle courier service that speeds up the diagnosis and monitoring of patients suffering from TB or HIV and enables them to start treatment early. In one year, RFH says, mobilized health workers have transported more than 400,000 medical samples and test results between rural health centers and labs. Andrea says the wellbeing of rural communities changes dramatically once they get regular access to health services. ""We have shown that the maintenance of vehicles is absolutely critical if you are going to be able to solve the health issues of rural Africa,"" says Andrea. ""And also we've shown how transport can be run cost-effectively and how local people really benefit when they are trained to a high standard to be technicians because it provides employment in the communities."" In their mid-60s now, the Colemans are still as passionate about improving access to healthcare as they were when they first started RFH. ""What gets me up in the morning is the idea that health workers who are very highly trained -- women and men living across Africa -- really want to get out to their rural communities and make sure that they are healthy,"" says Andrea. ""They can't do that by walking and it makes me really angry that there isn't more emphasis on making sure that transport runs properly.""","Riders for Health provides motorbikes to improve health care in rural Africa .

"(CNN) -- Qatar's youthful new ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has acquired another jewel in his burgeoning crown. The archaeological site of Al Zubarah on the northern tip of the tiny Arab emirate has been added by UNESCO to its list of World Heritage sites. The fortified ruins of the 18th century pearl fishing town will be Qatar's first world heritage site. The coastal town's exceptionally preserved remains provide an invaluable insight into the daily lives of the traders who populated the region in the 1700s. The site in located on the north-easternmost side of the Arabian Peninsula that juts into the Persian Gulf.

"(CNN) -- Chris McBee can now call himself a ""swarm chaser."" The storm-chasing tour guide and car dealership employee in Norman, Oklahoma, is used to tornadoes and wicked weather. But on Tuesday, he found himself rushing after chirping hordes of crickets in store parking lots near his home. ""The crickets have been thick for a couple of days now,"" he said Wednesday. ""It's worst at night where there are large lights, but they seem to be everywhere. There are carcasses everywhere in the morning too. It's pretty gross."" He had stopped by local businesses to collect video of the cricket explosion in western Norman when the bright lights of parking lots were like a beacon in the night for the creatures. McBee, 32, said he has lived in Oklahoma all his life and never seen anything like this. He remembers seeing large numbers of crickets at a train station in Dallas about 10 to 15 years ago, but that's about it. ""There are always a few crickets around in the summertime, but never a swarm like this,"" he said. Pictures of Oklahoma's crickets have been all over social media this week, dotting Instagram feeds and hopping around Twitter. McBee's own video became popular on CNN iReport. Got crickets? Share your story on CNN iReport . He noted that numbers were dwindling a bit by Friday. Now, he said, he occasionally catches a whiff of their rotting carcasses, which are leaving a lingering, rotten smell in the brightly lit areas where the crickets were congregating -- like outside grocery stores. ""You can definitely smell dead crickets if there's enough of them in the parking lot,"" he said, describing the stench as unpleasant, but not quite as intense as a rotting animal. Rick Grantham, an entomologist at Oklahoma State University, said a similar swarm of crickets occurred last year. Although the situation is reminiscent of a biblical plague, it's hard to define the so-called invasion of crickets as a plague, per se. ""I suppose if you have 10,000 dead crickets staring at you, they might seem like a plague,"" he said. This year, Grantham said, a weather pattern of prolonged dryness followed by rainfall in July and August may be to blame. Similar patterns were observed in Dallas and the southern Great Plains. Thus, the region provides good egg-laying conditions, shelter, safety and plenty of food. Since they have short lifespans, the crickets tend to rush to reproduce when the conditions are right in the air -- and on the ground. ""The wetter and looser the soil, the easier it is for them to lay those eggs,"" he said. ""Boom, you just go into a huge mating frenzy."" While the crickets are not considered an agricultural pest, Grantham said they are definitely a problem when they swarm, especially in commercial areas with bright security lights. ""You have the nuisance call and the high numbers and the dead bodies,"" he said. ""They might dive bomb you at a football game."" To get rid of them, Grantham recommends cleaning out trash dumps, checking window and door seals, and removing nighttime light sources at home, if possible. Sprays or aerosols applied to hiding places are another possibility. The chirping bugs may have appeared a few weeks earlier this year than last, said Brian Jervis, Tulsa County Extension Horticulturalist. He knows because he has personally observed them. ""We were shopping Sunday and underneath the storefront, there would be hundreds of them,"" he said. ""People would have to go under them."" In 2012, Jervis noticed them arriving at the end of September, which coincided with the Tulsa State Fair. ""With all the lights around, people were having to dodge them,"" he said. ""That was a frenzy."" Jervis said he is seeing an increase in calls from people wanting to know what to do about crickets. He suggests vacuuming loose crickets and varying the times that lights are on. Stomping on the bugs may seem like a good idea, but Jervis said that can backfire and cause the population to grow. ""We want to kill them to keep them from moving, but when you kill them, the other ones are going to come in and eat the dead ones,"" he said. Grantham said crickets will eat just about anything, including plant material and each other. ""Sometimes when they're younger, they do practice cannibalism, and when they get older, they do eat dead crickets,"" he noted. When will they be gone? Grantham said to give it another week, but some Oklahomans would say the sooner, the better.","Huge swarms of crickets have been springing up in Oklahoma, and on social media .

"(CNN) -- A 30-year-old father who police say decapitated his 7-year-old disabled son is unfit for trial, a Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, judge ruled Tuesday. Jeremiah Lee Wright is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Jori Lirette. The second-grade boy was killed on August 14 in the town of Thibodaux. The killing was an act horrific enough to shock the community and grab national attention. Police have said Wright confessed that he decapitated the boy. District Judge John E. LeBlanc found Wright ""was not competent to stand trial,"" Court Clerk Pam Cheriamie said. ""Two psychiatrists appointed by the court to examine Wright were subpoenaed to testify,"" she said. But Wright's defense attorney, Kerry Cuccia, said the psychiatrists didn't testify, but their reports were submitted. Cuccia said he could not say why his client was found not fit to stand trial. ""The judge sealed the records with specifics on the mental evaluation,"" he said. But he added, ""The judge announced my client lacks the mental capacity to proceed and stand trial. This means he has to appropriately understand the nature of the proceedings before him and be able to assist his lawyer with his own defense."" He said Wright was sent to a state mental health facility in Jackson for further evaluation. A status hearing was scheduled for January 31 ""to see if he's been rehabilitated and (is) competent enough for trial,"" Cheriamie said. Thibodaux police were called to Wright's house on August 14 by a person who said a severed head was sitting on the side of a city street. Investigators found a white garbage bag nearby with the child's body inside, police said. ""The child had cerebral palsy and was bound to a wheelchair (and also had) additional disabilities,"" Thibodaux Police Chief Scott Silverii said in August. ""He also required a feeding tube and he wasn't able to speak verbally."" The chief said Wright confessed he decapitated the child. Investigators recovered a hacksaw that they believe was the murder weapon. ""During the interview, Wright said he was taking care of (the child) for so many years and he just started to look at him as no longer his son, just an inanimate object,"" Silverii said. ""He and the child's mother had some issues. And he purposely put the child's head in a position for her to see it.""","Police say Jeremiah Lee Wright confessed that he beheaded his son .

"Berlin (CNN) -- The international manhunt for the porn actor accused of killing and dismembering a man in Canada ended Monday in a Berlin internet cafe with the arrest of Luka Rocco Magnotta, according to authorities in Canada and Germany. An employee of the cafe recognized Magnotta and flagged down a carload of German police cadets, who arrested Magnotta without incident at the cafe in a predominantly Turkish neighborhood of Berlin popular with students and young people. ""You got me,"" Magnotta told officers after initially denying his identity, according to German police. He had spent about an hour at the nondescript cafe perusing internet news accounts of his exploits, according to a cafe worker. Suspect describes himself as 'people person' ""We can confirm this individual has been arrested,"" said Julie Carmichael, a Canadian Ministry of Public Safety spokeswoman. ""We expect that the individual responsible for these troubling acts will face the full force of the law."" Authorities in Montreal -- where police found murder victim Jun Lin's torso in a trash bin outside Magnotta's apartment -- were ""extremely relieved"" about the arrest, police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere told reporters. He said that investigators would begin looking into possible links to other crimes and that authorities have much work ahead of them in bringing Magnotta back to Canada to face trial. ""This is far from being over,"" Lafreniere said. Authorities were seeking Magnotta on first-degree murder and other charges in the killing of Jun Lin, 33, a Concordia University student from China, and threatening, among others, Canada's prime minister by mailing him a severed foot. Not all the body parts have been recovered, and Lafreniere said forensic evidence and DNA were used to identify the victim as Jun. The search for Magnotta had captured worldwide attention after news that the efforts to find him had moved to France following a number of reported sightings there. Magnotta was believed to have fled to Paris under an assumed name, Lafreniere said. He said authorities did not yet know when Magnotta had traveled to Germany, or how. The case began last week when a package addressed to Prime Minister Stephen Harper arrived at his majority Conservative Party headquarters, and a hand was later found at a post office addressed to the minority Liberal Party, authorities said. Authorities quickly traced the address on the packages to the Montreal apartment of Magnotta, where they discovered a torso in a suitcase in a trash bin. Lin's death and dismemberment were allegedly captured on a graphic video posted to the Internet, according to Montreal police. It features a man -- who authorities believe is Magnotta -- killing another man, dismembering the corpse and performing sexual acts. ""We believe he filmed himself,"" Lafreniere said last week. ""It's gross. ... This is a very deranged person. He is looking for attention, and he got it, but not in a positive way."" Authorities believe Magnotta killed Jun on May 24 or May 25, posted the video, and on May 26 fled the country by plane to Europe, most likely Paris. That prompted Interpol, the global police agency, to alert authorities in 190 countries. Over the weekend, police said there were indications that the suspect may have been aboard a flight from Paris back to Montreal. There was no sign of him after a search of the plane, Lafreniere said. Since the case went public, new details have emerged daily, new chapters in a grisly saga with an alleged culprit that police say is infatuated with self-promotion. According to Canadian media reports, Magnotta promoted himself as a gay porn actor through a graphic website that showcases a chameleon-like quality: the ability to change his appearance. In one picture, with dark hair, he resembles a teenager. In another, with blond hair, he looks rough. Authorities allege he even changes his names, using the aliases Eric Newman or Vladimir Romanov. ""There are a lot of pictures of him out there, and it will help lead him to us,"" Lafreniere told reporters over the weekend. His name may not have been known before last week, but Magnotta's digital footprints were large. He was notorious among online animal rights activists, who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used cat carcasses in sexual acts. A Facebook group started in December 2010 dubbed him the ""Vacuum Kitten Killer,"" after a video was posted on YouTube showing kittens being killed by suffocation and drowning. Several Canadian newspapers also reported that Magnotta had dated notorious Canadian killer Karla Homolka, who years before was arrested for the rapes and murders of three Ontario girls, including her own sister. As part of a plea bargain, Homolka served 12 years in prison. Lafreniere said he could not confirm any links and Homolka is not part of the investigation. Now, there are reports that Magnotta threatened to kill as early as six months ago during an encounter with a reporter at the Sun. The British newspaper implicated Magnotta as a suspect in the videotaped killing of a kitten, which it reports he initially denied. Then, according to the newspaper, it received an e-mail describing how the writer planned to move on from killing animals to people. The writer, the newspaper reported over the weekend, was Magnotta. ""We're talking about a very strange, unhinged individual,"" said the Sun's Neil Millard. ""Obviously, we did give those details to the police in this country."" But there was little British authorities could do, with Magnotta back in Canada. Lafreniere has said police are aware of the animal abuse allegations. On what appears to be his website, Magnotta defended himself as a victim of cyberstalking. ""Once and for all, I will set the record straight,"" he wrote. ""Many hoax websites are created using my image and name, posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website (sic) have, I feel I don't need to list them specifically but people need not be told, not to believe what they read and to take it as fact."" The website has writing in Arabic and Russian, and shows images of Magnotta half-naked and with his lips in a distinct runway pout. Lafreniere from the Montreal police had expressed confidence that Magnotta would be caught sooner or later -- predicting his desire for attention could be his downfall. ""This man uses the Web to glorify himself, and (authorities) hope this habit will lead to his capture,"" the police commander said Saturday. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Paula Newton and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Berlin police trainees arrested Luka Rocco Magnotta at an Internet cafe in Berlin .

"(CNN) -- The president of the Maldives, one of the world's most popular honeymoon destinations, resigned Tuesday after a revolt by police officers, his spokesman said, leaving the normally idyllic chain of islands in chaos. Mohamed Nasheed was the first democratically elected president of the Indian Ocean nation in three decades. ""This morning, about 500 opposition supporters along with some Islamic hardliners protested outside the army headquarters, shouting slogans, and some police officers mutinied and joined them,"" Nasheed's spokeman said. ""And so, the president was in a situation where he could either tell the army to forcibly crack down on the protesters or he could step down. He chose the latter. ""This is a situation where the first democratically elected president in the Maldives is taken down by a former dictator and his supporters,"" the spokesman said. Nasheed said in a nationally televised address that he was stepping down because he didn't feel he was able to maintain security and peace in the country, which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. Strategically located in the Indian Ocean but extremely poor, the country is threatened by rising sea levels. Nasheed once held a Cabinet meeting underwater, with ministers wearing scuba gear, to highlight the problem. Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan was sworn in as president shortly after Nasheed resigned. But journalist Sumon Chakrabarti, who is at work on a book about the Maldives, suggested Hassan is a puppet who would not last. ""He comes from a very small political party. He's respected as an academic"" but has little support of his own, Chakrabarti said. ""I doubt how long they will allow this man to remain in power."" Chakrabarti said he felt the coup was ""the end of democracy in the Maldives. It throws the whole notion of democracy out of the window."" And that is a cause for international concern, he said. ""Here was the country's first democratically elected president and he was forced to resign by a cocktail of religious extremists, the brother of the former president... forces like businessmen who are also members of Parliament, and then the police force, which was always loyal to the former dictator,"" he said. The police officers appeared to have sided with the Progressive Party, which is loyal to former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled Maldives for 30 years before Nasheed defeated him. Nasheed had faced strong criticism in recent months from opposition groups calling for Islam to play a greater role in the running of the country, spurred in part by the supporters of Gayoom. The country is more than 98% Muslim, according to a 2011 Pew Forum report on the global Muslim population. The coup signals a rise in extremism, Chakrabarti said. ""It's going from being one of the most moderate Muslim nations on Earth towards extremism,"" he said. The different political parties in the country, an archipelago of almost 1,200 coral islands south-southwest of India, planned to meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the next step, said Bunya Maumoon, a spokeswoman for the Progressive Party. In 2008, Nasheed became the country's first democratically elected president in 30 years. The nation was rocked by violent protests last year that Nasheed accused Gayoom's supporters of orchestrating. But demonstrators said at the time they were protesting economic conditions, created by reforms imposed by Nasheed. The government also clashed with opposition groups in December over the issues of massage parlors and the sale of pork and alcohol in resorts. Tuesday's events unfolded after about 200 policemen gathered in Republic Square in the capital, Male, according to Ahmed Rasheed, an executive producer at the state TV station. A peaceful standoff with members of the Maldives defense forces in the square turned violent early Tuesday morning, he said, describing the situation in Male as ""chaos."" The policemen took over the state TV station later Tuesday morning. They changed its name from the Maldives National Broadcasting Corporation back to its old name, Television Maldives. Gayoom is still considered a hero by many in Maldives who credit him for transforming a fishing culture into a tourist nation. During his long rule, Nasheed was among his fiercest critics, alleging that Gayoom ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent, amassing wealth and stacking his administration with friends and relatives. Nasheed was arrested as a journalist several times and held as a political prisoner. Until his defeat by Nasheed, Gayoom won six previous elections as the only candidate on the ballot. He had sought a seventh five-year term, saying that he would need a few more years to see through the reforms he has put in place. Maldives is also grappling with a very likely possibility that it will go under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels. Most of it lies just 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) above sea . The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change has forecast a rise in sea levels of at least 7.1 inches (18 cm) by the end of the century. Male is already protected by sea walls. But creating a similar barrier around the rest of the country will be cost-prohibitive. Soon after his election, Nasheed raised the possibility of finding a new homeland for the country's approximately 400,000 residents. He is the subject of an upcoming documentary, ""The Island President,"" that tells the story of his efforts to raise awareness of climate change. CNN's Sarita Harilela, Sumnima Das and Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","NEW: The Maldives is going from moderate Islam towards extremism, an analyst says .

"(CNN) -- Being a good father is attracting attention these days. Consider: A&E Network plans a new reality show this fall about dads who work at home, called ""Modern Dads."" The Fox network has ordered a new series co-written by Seth MacFarlane called ""Dads."" NBC's ""Parenthood,"" which features some dads at home, has been renewed for a fifth season. Amazon.com carries more than 100,000 books about how to be a father, almost as many as it sells on how to be a mother. Search on Google for ""being a good father or dad"" and you get about 600 million results. Government agencies and private organizations spend millions of dollars promoting responsible fatherhood. Even prisons have caught the fever, offering young incarcerated fathers classes on coping with baby tantrums and preparing baby food. Here's the problem: Despite the hoopla over involved dads, more children than ever live without a father in the home. In 1960, the figure was one out of 10 children. Today it's one out of three. A new study sponsored by the Guttmacher Institute suggests one reason why. Research shows that four out of every 10 new fathers -- especially younger, less-educated men -- said their babies' births were unintended. And we know from research that those fathers, in particular those who are not married to their children's mothers, are more likely to walk away from the family than fathers whose children were planned. Could it be that by focusing so much attention on how to be a good father, we have failed to talk enough about when to become a father? Over the last half-century, fathers have tripled the amount of time they spend with their kids, but that's only about half as much time as mothers spend. Television studios may be excited about dads who work at home, but in fact such fathers are only 3.4% of parents at home full time. We consider contraception ""a female problem."" We discuss the timing of pregnancy and parenting less often with young men than with young women, and even family planning programs haven't been very successful in reaching the guys. This may help explain why 18- to 29-year-old men, who say it is important to avoid pregnancy ""right now,"" are more than twice as likely as young women to say they would be pleased if they found out that their partner was pregnant, according to a 2010 report by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. The report said this was true both for men living with their partners and those who were not. Perhaps some of those men hold on to the tired assumption that fathering a child makes them manlier. Perhaps others are genuinely interested in having a child. What we know for sure, says Kelleen Kaye, co-author of ""The Fog Zone,"" is that if being a parent is harder than men thought it would be, ""they can easily leave their partners holding the bag."" And many young fathers do that. In fact the proportion of mothers in this country who are single, 36%, is rising, particularly among low-income mothers, and it shows no signs of slowing down. Fatherhood should begin not with having a baby, but being thoughtful earlier about how one would support a child. Questions about becoming a father are not that different from those for a would-be mother: Are you in a stable, committed relationship? How well do you and your partner know each other? How much do you trust each other? Do you have enough education to secure a good job? If you and/or your partner are employed, do you earn enough to support your family? Are you ready for the lifelong responsibilities of being a parent? There are other considerations for men who want to be involved fathers that are not so obvious. Stewart Friedman, management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, raised some of them in a recent blog for Harvard Business Review. Men are increasingly interested in ""engaging more fully as caregivers and homemakers,"" he wrote, but gender stereotypes hold them back. ""Men may wonder, what if I'm just not a good dad? What if I'm perceived by my friends as unmanly because I'm doing 'women's work?' What if my children seem me as a poor role model because I'm not the main breadwinner? What if my boss thinks I'm less committed because I'm not at the office as much as the other guys at my level?"" These are all good, important questions to think about before starting a family. Because the best thing you can do to be a good father is to wait until you're ready to be a father. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laura Stepp.","Laura Stepp: Lots of new shows, books and programs on being a good father these days .
That's good, she says, but fewer and fewer American families have a dad at home .
Fathers more likely to walk away when a child was unplanned, she says .
Stepp: Let's emphasize that the best way to be a good dad is to wait till you're ready ."
"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Matt Sandusky, one of six adopted children of Jerry Sandusky, said through his attorney Thursday that he was sexually abused by the former Penn State assistant football coach, adding that he had been prepared to testify against him in a high-profile child rape case. The revelation came on the same day a Pennsylvania jury began deliberating the fate of Jerry Sandusky, who is confronted with accusations of child sexual abuse involving 10 alleged victims. Jurors deliberated until about 9:30 p.m. Thursday. They will reconvene Friday morning and review testimony from two witnesses. Matt Sandusky's accusation could lead to additional charges, including incest, even though he is adopted, according to Marci Hamilton, a Cardozo Law School professor who has represented victims and written on sexual abuse cases. ""At Matt's request, we immediately arranged a meeting between him and the prosecutors and investigators,"" attorneys Andrew Shubin and Justine Andronici said in a statement. ""This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt, and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy."" Jerry Sandusky, 68, pleaded not guilty to charges of child sex abuse over a 15-year period. After a week of testimony, jurors will have to decide without having heard from the former Penn State defensive coordinator on the witness stand. During closing arguments, his defense sought to poke holes in the prosecution's case, pointing to inconsistencies with the testimony of Mike McQueary, a former graduate student and assistant coach who said he saw Sandusky apparently sodomizing a boy in a university shower. Defense attorney Joe Amendola reminded jurors of the lack of physical evidence in the case. He accused the alleged victims of conspiring for financial gain while blaming the media for what he described as biased coverage. During the arguments, Sandusky's wife, Dottie, was seen quietly crying. What Sandusky has said about child rape allegations . Lead prosecutor Joseph McGettigan followed Amendola, rebuffing the defense's account of a coordinated action among Sandusky's accusers allegedly bent on financial windfall. ""The great thing about conspiracy theories is you just let them go on and on, until they collapse under their own weight,"" he said. McGettigan described the former coach as a pedophile who systematically preyed on his victims using a charity he founded for troubled children, identifying and repeatedly abusing young boys in his care. ""The commonwealth has overwhelming evidence against Mr. Sandusky,"" he said. Earlier Thursday, Judge John Cleland announced that three of the counts were dropped against the former coach, bringing the total number of charges to 48. He told jurors that all three counts pertain to ""alleged victim 4,"" while the defense further petitioned to have all counts related to ""alleged victim 8"" dismissed as well. Cleland said one count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse duplicated another charge. Two other counts -- one of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and another of aggravated indecent assault -- were not supported by testimony and the evidence presented, Cleland found. Prosecutors dropped one of the original 52 counts earlier this week because the statute on which that charge was based wasn't in effect on the date of the alleged incident. His accuser said it occurred in 1995 or 1996, but the unlawful contact with a minor statute didn't apply until 1997. The prosecution had called its only rebuttal witness Tuesday, to counter testimony that raised questions about Sandusky's mental health. All you need to know about allegations, how case unraveled . Dr. Elliot Atkins testified that he diagnosed Sandusky with histrionic personality disorder, part of a class of conditions called dramatic personality disorders that are marked by unstable emotions and distorted self-images. But a second psychologist, prosecution witness Dr. John O'Brien, disputed those findings, saying that the ""personality profile Mr. Sandusky exhibited was within normal limits."" Some court observers had said that if Sandusky were to testify, prosecutors could submit as new evidence a TV interview the ex-coach had with NBC sportscaster Bob Costas. In a portion of the interview that was not part of the original November broadcast, Sandusky told Costas that he ""didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped."" There are likely ""many young people who would come forward and say that my methods and what I had done for them made a very positive impact on their life,"" Sandusky said. On Wednesday, the defense called Dr. Jonathan Dranov, an acquaintance of McQueary's, who told jurors that the former assistant coach told him he heard ""sexual sounds"" and saw the boy in the shower when an arm reached around him but, did not actually see a sexual encounter. Sandusky then emerged from the shower area, he said. That account is different from what McQueary described in his testimony. He said that he witnessed Sandusky pressing against the boy in the shower and that it seemed obvious that he had been raping him. Jurors on Thursday told the judge they'd like to review testimony by McQueary and Dranov. Cleland agreed. Matt Sandusky's name came up during testimony from one of the alleged victims. 'The Sandusky 8' describe seduction, molestation and betrayal . The accuser talked about what occurred after he played racquetball once with Jerry and Matt Sandusky. ""Matt went into the shower, and then me and Jerry came in ... he started pumping his hand full of soap, like he was going to throw it. Matt got out ... he went to another shower [area]."" The witness, the first accuser to take the stand, said Matt Sandusky looked ""nervous"" when he saw that Jerry Sandusky was about to start a soap fight. According to several of the alleged victims, Jerry Sandusky would often use shower ""soap fights"" as a prelude to inappropriate sexual contact. In his 2001 autobiography, ""Touched,"" Jerry Sandusky wrote about his relationship with Matt Sandusky, who he met through Second Mile when the youth was 7 or 8. ""He would visit our house occasionally, but he was never one to get very attached to anyone. He would stand off in the corner somewhere and watch as I would be wrestling with the other kids. He became an instant challenge for me,"" Sandusky wrote. ""I didn't want to see him go through life by himself at such a young age. I didn't want to lose him to whatever other fates might have awaited him, so I kept trying and trying to pull him in."" Sandusky detailed the youth's discipline problems and struggles, ultimately becoming close to his new family. ""He had the strength and the courage to stay loyal to us even when we weren't sure what would happen,"" Sandusky wrote. ""He could have hurt us. He could have driven us out of his life, but he didn't. And that will always mean the world to us."" Meanwhile, a man who claims he was repeatedly sexually abused by Sandusky while a child spoke out Thursday. ""He (once) told me if I ever said anything that nobody was going to believe me and he would get my dad fired from Penn State,"" Travis Weaver, 30, told NBC's ""Rock Center with Brian Williams."" Weaver did not testify in Sandusky's trial, but did file a civil action against the former coach. Weaver's attorney, Marci Hamilton, told CNN, ""Travis's story fits in with other survivors, but also Matt Sandusky."" She said her client at first thought he was the only victim. ""When he found out there were others, he was in real misery,"" Hamilton said, adding Sandusky tried to adopt Weaver.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced an initiative he said will give African-American students greater access ""to a complete and competitive education from the time they're born all through the time they get a career."" Speaking Wednesday night at a National Urban League gathering in New Orleans, Obama said he has issued an executive order establishing the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, saying, ""A higher education in a 21st century cannot be a luxury. It is a vital necessity that every American should be able to afford,"" he said. He added that his administration is ""pushing all colleges and universities"" to cut their costs. The president focused the bulk of his comments on the economy, saying his tax policies and economic plans aim to boost the middle class. ""We also believe that every entrepreneur should have a chance to start a business, no matter who you are, no matter what you look like,"" he said. ""That's why we've helped African-American businesses and minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses gain access to more than $7 billion in contracts and financing that allow them to grow and create jobs."" A spokeswoman for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney responded to the speech, saying Obama has ""disappointed"" African-Americans with his performance on the economy. ""As black Americans, we all take pride in Barack Obama's historic election,"" said Tara Wall, senior communications and coalition adviser for the Romney campaign, ""but unfortunately his performance as president has not matched that enthusiasm. He's disappointed black small business owners, failed to address rising black unemployment -- which now stands at over 14%, and is double that among our youth -- and failed to address the widening economic disparity gap."" Obama's executive order comes in the wake of a new report by the National Urban League's Policy Institute that warned the president could lose three key battleground states -- Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio -- if African-American voters don't match their strong turnout of 2008 in this year's election. ""African-American voters tipped the outcome of the 2008 presidential election in several key states, and are poised to do so again in 2012,"" said the report, titled ""The Hidden Swing Voters: Impact of African-Americans in 2012"" by Madura Wijewardena and Valerie Wilson. ""How this will manifest will depend on many things, but one important factor will be whether the extraordinary growth in turnout by African-American voters in 2008 will be replicated in 2012,"" the report continued. ""The 2008 voter turnout rate was driven by historic factors that may not necessarily apply in 2012."" The ""historic factors"" reference was to Obama being the nation's first African-American nominee of a major party, with voters having the opportunity in 2008 to make him the nation's first African-American president. This time, an economy struggling to recover from a recession that hit African-Americans particularly hard has raised questions about whether Obama supporters will have the same fervor as they did four years ago. A recent Gallup Poll showed the president with overwhelming support among registered African-American voters, with backing of 89%, compared with 5% for certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney. In 2008, Obama won 95% of the African-American vote, with 4% voting for GOP candidate John McCain. About 2 million more African-Americans voted in the 2008 election than in 2004, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures. Voting by all minority groups accounted for nearly all the increase in turnout (5 million) between the two election cycles, as white non-Hispanic voting was virtually unchanged, the Census Bureau reported. A decline in African-American voter turnout to the 2004 level of 60% from the 2008 level of 64.7% would cause Obama to lose in North Carolina and possibly lose in Ohio and Virginia, according to the National Urban League Policy Institute report. Obama won all three states in 2008, and most scenarios for Obama's re-election depend on him winning at least two of them this time. Ohio has 18 electoral votes, while North Carolina has 15 and Virginia has 13. A fierce start to the election campaign, with the candidates and their supporting super PACs launching bitter attacks, has made ensuring enthusiastic backing from traditional support bases a key to victory in November. The president's speech Wednesday concluded a four-day, six-state swing that started earlier than planned Sunday so he could visit Aurora, Colorado, after last week's mass shooting at a movie theater. During the speech, Obama made some of the most forceful statements of his presidency on the issue of gun violence, saying that while he respects the nation's hunting and gun-owning traditions, ""We should leave no stone unturned and recognize that we have no greater mission as a country than keeping our young people safe."" CNN's Lesa Jansen, Tom Cohen and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","NEW: Executive order establishes African-American higher education initiative .

"(CNN) -- Nigerian writer Tope Folarin has been announced as the winner of this year's Caine Prize for African Writing. The U.S.-based author scooped the accolade -- which has been described as Africa's leading literary award -- for his short story ""Miracle,"" a tale of faith and deceit in an evangelical Nigerian church in Texas. ""Winning feels tremendous -- I still can't believe it,"" enthused the 31-year-old author. ""I feel like I'm walking on air."" Folarin spent a year writing the story, which explores the relationship between a blind pastor-prophet and his faithful congregation. ""It's a community I know quite well,"" he explained. ""'Miracle' does have an autobiographical quality to it, because the dreams and desires described are ones I share as a writer in the Nigerian diaspora."" Watch this: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie cries over praise . The Washington D.C.-based author, who was born and raised in the U.S. but lived in Nigeria for a year, said that fellow members of the community had responded well to his story. But striking the right tone had its challenges. ""I spent a long time trying to get a particular voice down, and that was the greatest technical difficulty I had when writing the novel,"" Folarin said. ""Watching Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' -- where a movie star walks off screen and into real life -- helped me to define that voice, and introduce the narrator's transition from using 'we' to 'I'."" Gus Chaseley-Hayford, chair of judges for the prize, described Folarin's winning prose as a ""superb Caine Prize winner -- a delightful and beautifully paced narrative, that is exquisitely observed and utterly compelling."" The decision was announced at the 14th Caine Prize ceremony, held Monday night at Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, where Folarin beat his four fellow shortlisted candidates. Three of the other contenders were Nigerian, as was last year's prize winner, Rotimi Babatunde. ""I know that myself and other Nigerian writers have been empowered by a long tradition of Nigerian authors writing beautifully,"" said Folarin. ""At times when we're struggling to write, we derive great power from the work that has come before us."" Folarin has previously received literary fellowships from The Institute for Policy Studies and the journal ""Callalloo,"" as well as studying for two Master's degrees at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. His Caine Prize win means he is eligible to take up a month's tenure as Writer-in-Residence at the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice at Georgetown University, which he plans to begin before the end of the year. Describing himself as a ""savings freak,"" Folarin has no grand plans for his Â£10,000 ($14,840) prize fund as yet, but his future literary plans are more defined. ""'Miracle' is part of a manuscript I've been working on for three years, which ties together a number of novels through a single lead protagonist,"" he divulged. ""I hope to get that published at some stage in the future, but my main focus right now is just being the best writer I can be. ""Nothing else matters to me.""","Tope Folarin wins top prize for African Writing .

"(CNN) -- Sometime on Sunday, the world will lurch a little on its axis. There'll be a thunderclap heard around the globe, a blinding flash of light, and the people of the Internet will fall to their knees in reverence. On that day, Justin Bieber will pass Lady Gaga as the most followed account on Twitter. As of Friday afternoon Gaga had more than 33,198,000 followers -- some 46,000 more than Bieber, who was close behind at 33,152,000. (That's more than the population of Peru.)

"(CNN) -- G8 summits are often fertile ground for the most grandiose of political promises. True to form, this year's one didn't disappoint: The leaders of the U.S. and the EU fired the starting gun in the race to create the biggest bilateral trade agreement the world has ever seen. Despite tensions surrounding revelations of alleged U.S. spying on key EU figures, the talks officially kicked off this week. But what are the chances of such a deal coming to fruition? Read more: EU envoys meet over claims of U.S. spying on European allies . And by the time each side has had its say, will the new pact really bring the benefits touted today? At a recent event I chaired in Brussels, former World Bank president and one-time U.S. trade negotiator Bob Zoellick was skeptical. Talk is cheap, he said, what matters is what's achieved. Obama visit: Why U.S. now needs Germany more than ever . One thing Zoellick was adamant about is that it will take years to get any definite deal up and running, and by the time concessions have been made the agreement is likely to look rather different to the original blueprint. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership -- or TTIP for short -- is an ambitious project, designed to boost what is already the world's most important inter-regional trading relationship. Both partners are betting it will add generously to the 13 million or so jobs that depend on transatlantic trade, whilst boosting investment in key sectors starved of cash during the global financial crisis. Outgoing World Bank chief: Fix eurozone . Make no mistake, each side needs this deal badly: To speed up the painfully slow recovery and provide an effective counterweight to China, whose cheap exports have put scores of American and European firms out of business. But there are limits to what each side will accept. The logic is by removing all tariffs on goods and harmonizing regulatory standards for the production of cars to crops, the regions will be able to create one gargantuan market for their goods and services. France has so far successfully lobbied to protect Europe's film and music industry while the U.S. could retaliate with its own conditions, meaning the chances of a fully comprehensive framework look slim. Worth up to around $280 billion, the TTIP will cement an alliance between two blocs which already account for almost half of the world's gross domestic product. Richard Quest: US-EU trade deal not in 'our lifetime' All this may sound great in principle but the reality is stronger U.S.-EU ties risk alienating large emerging economies that have been deliberately excluded. China has watched the transatlantic nations' dubious stewardship of the world economy with increasing alarm. It will not take kindly to their stranglehold over world trade. Back in Europe, some are already questioning whether the TTIP's economic benefits will be evenly shared. A survey commissioned by Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation expected U.S. incomes would rise 13.4% per head thanks to the TTIP, whereas those in Europe would only increase 5%. Even among EU member states the trickle down effect is likely to be uneven with the UK's economy likely to grow 9.7% while that of France would expand just 2.6%, the study found. What also remains unclear is the effect increased trade with the U.S. would have on intra-EU commerce upon which many member states are heavily reliant. Still, on balance, even if there are fewer crumbs to be had on its side of the table, Europe has the most to lose if the TTIP doesn't go through. Why? because it has fewer options than America. Dogged by uncomfortably high unemployment and repeated recessions, one gets the sense the European Commission views the TTIP rather like a ""get out of jail"" card. Faced with no effective policy to tackle its issues, a crisis of leadership and a dearth of funds, Brussels appears to believe the TTIP will prove to be some sort of panacea. Another unknown is whether the business community will buy into the TTIP. Large firms often talk up the merits of free trade but shy away from the cumbersome aspects that new trading environments often offer. The nascent U.S.-EU trade negotiations aim to achieve much but it will take years to work out the details and by the time the TTIP is up and running the economy will probably be back on its feet again. Hopefully by then they will have dreamed up a new name though. After all ""TIP"" is hardly a promising acronym for the biggest deal on the planet.","Worth up to around $280 billion, the agreement will cement an alliance between the two blocs .

"(CNN) -- Two children are among four people who died after a boat carrying at least 160 people capsized off the coast of West Java, Indonesian rescue officials said Wednesday. Fisherman, who saw people floating in the water on Tuesday night, alerted search and rescue teams that worked in the dark to find survivors, said Rochmali, the head of Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Team. Rochmali -- like many Indonesians -- only uses one name. Some made it to land on their own and were found along the beach just off Cianjur District, south of Bandung, the capital of West Java Province, he said. So far, 156 survivors have been taken to temporary shelters and clinics on the island. Rescuers in rubber boats and local fisherman continue to search the water for remaining survivors in choppy sea within 5 nautical miles of the shore. Some media reports suggested that as many as 60 people were missing, though that number could not be confirmed as the boat was not registered and carries no official passenger list. ""We don't know how many people were on board, because the survivors are reluctant to tell us,"" said Rochmali. It's uncertain where the boat was headed, although Rochmali said Indonesian officials believe they were on their way to Australian waters near Christmas Island to seek possible asylum. READ MORE: Riots as Australia shuts door on asylum . ""They don't want to talk to officials frankly about their intention and who they are. Even some of them tried to run away, or maybe already run away after being saved,"" he said. Those who had spoken to officers claimed they were nationals of Iran, Iraq, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, Rochmali said. ""But whether it is true or not, we still have to reconfirm,"" he added. Last week, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that asylum seekers arriving in Australian waters would no longer be resettled in the country. Instead, they'll be sent to Papua New Guinea for processing and will be settled there if found to be refugees. If their bids fail, they'll be sent home or to another country, Rudd announced. READ MORE: Why Australia's asylum plan won't work . Rights groups have condemned the policy, accusing the Australian government of shirking its responsibility for asylum seekers. ""It cannot possibly be presented as an example of regional cooperation because it is little more than a wealthy country paying a much weaker neighbor to take on its international responsibilities to people seeking asylum,"" said Paul Power, chief executive officer of the Refugee Council of Australia. On Wednesday, Rudd said the tragedy off West Java emphasized the need for policy changes to send ""a clear message to people smugglers to stop sending people by boat to Australia."" ""We're seeing too many drownings, we're seeing too many sinkings, too many innocent people being lost at sea,"" according to Rudd. Australian agencies were monitoring the situation, he said. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority declined to comment on the rescue to CNN, saying it was being handled by Indonesian authorities.

"(CNN) -- Christine Swidorsky and Sean Stevenson may be counting the hours until their wedding this Saturday, but the day will be bittersweet. The couple's 2-year-old son, Logan, is dying. Though Logan was given just weeks to live, the couple, from Jeannette, Pennsylvania, about 40 minutes from Pittsburgh, plans to honor him as their best man. The pictures show a sweet, young boy, deeply loved by his family. His mother, Christine, spoke to CNN. ""Me and Sean wanted to have a nice wedding next July,"" she said. ""There's no way I can get married and not have Logan in our family photos."" And certainly, Logan will shine in his fine wedding suit. With 120 to 130 wedding guests, there will be plenty to celebrate. Christine often talks about how Logan's a fighter who's always stayed strong. Born on October 22, 2010, he weighed just 3 pounds. Eating troubles kept Logan in the hospital, but he kept fighting, kept growing, and was soon home with his parents and his two older sisters. Christine originally hoped to call him Sean, after his dad, but Sean disagreed. So one day, while leafing through a baby naming book, Sean stumbled onto ""Logan,"" and it felt perfect to them both. And for his first year, he grew, he was healthy, and he made his family unspeakably happy. Even today, as his life nears an end, Christine struggles to find words to say what an amazing little boy he is. Just after Logan's first birthday, Christine noticed that he wasn't feeling well again, and his lips and fingernails had turned white. Over the course of a month, she took Logan to the pediatrician four times before the head pediatrician tended to him. When he did, he quickly called 911. Christine says Logan shocked doctors at the Pittsburgh children's hospital. His leukemia had progressed so far, they were surprised he was still alive. Chemotherapy was started right away, taking an extraordinary toll on his body. Sean and Christine learned more devastating news shortly after: Logan has a genetic disorder called Fanconi anemia, which most frequently results in death, most commonly from cancer, between the ages of 25 and 30. But Logan fought hard, just like he had done as a newborn. He landed in the ICU but pulled through, and by July 13, 2012, doctors were prepared to give him a blood stem cell transplant. After his stem cell treatment, he was free of leukemia for nine months, eating and acting like any other child. Life started to feel normal for Logan's family, but Christine's gut feeling returned when she saw Logan acting strange again. It was cancer again: a mass the size of an orange on Logan's larger and better-functioning kidney. Doctors had no choice but to remove the kidney, just a week before Easter of this year. Life gained a long-sought-after normalcy for Logan and the family, except for the twice-weekly visits to a clinic for his chemotherapy. The therapy, though not a perfect solution for Logan, would hopefully prevent a recurrence of the cancer, despite being a lower dose than average. Logan's life continued to improve. ""He was eating bowl after bowl"" of spaghetti, ""it was a wonderful feeling,"" Christine says. But then he started getting fevers, then throwing up. His left side swelled as the mass returned, where the kidney once was. ""I thought he was doing so well ... it's like you take two steps forward, 15 back,"" Christine says. The doctors told Logan's family that they could only do more harm than good. And in June, as the family's fortunes continued to fail, the Make a Wish Foundation gave them a trip to Disney World. But after just four hours there, Logan was back in the hospital. Eight days of torture ensued, as he had developed an infection and eventually needed to be flown home to Jeannette. Finally, on July 26, Doctors gave Logan one to two weeks to live. But the wedding that Sean and Christine planned for next year certainly couldn't happen without him. So with the help of friends and family, it has been moved to Saturday, not in a banquet hall, but in the family's backyard ""because it may make Logan uncomfortable"" to be in strange surroundings with so much noise. His once big, beautiful curls are no longer atop his head, but his handsome suit will be pressed as Logan will be by his dad's side on the wedding day. Christine doesn't refer to it as the end for Logan, but as the start of his ""journey."" She is ""a different person. I'm a better person; he's made me a strong person."" The strength is in her voice, in her resolve to have her son in her wedding, and she's thankful for it. ""He has brought so much joy into our lives. I couldn't have asked for a better son.","Doctors say Logan, 2, has less than a month to live .

"(CNN) -- Celebrity chef Paula Deen hopes the Supreme Court's ruling allowing same-sex marriage to be legal in California will help in her defense against a racial discrimination lawsuit. The woman alleging that she was subjected to a hostile work environment while working as an assistant manager at Deen's restaurants is white and therefore doesn't have the ""standing,"" or legal right, to claim racial discrimination, according to a motion filed Monday by Deen's lawyer. The high court rejected an appeal of California's Proposition 8 law last week on the grounds that the private parties behind the appeal did not have standing to defend the ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. Even if the federal judge in Savannah, Georgia, accepts the argument and tosses the lawsuit, much damage has already been done to Deen's career and businesses by the public fallout from a deposition in which she acknowledged using the ""N-word."" Chat: Comfort food, uncomfortable topics . Asked by the lawyer taking the deposition if she had ever used the word, she said, ""Yes, of course."" She said she had probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about ""when a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head"" -- an incident that took place 30 years ago. Asked if she had used it since then, she said, ""I'm sure I have, but it's been a very long time."" She noted that circumstances have changed ""since the '60s in the South."" Many of Deen's lucrative business relationships have crumbled in the wake of media coverage of the lawsuit. She has lost at least nine endorsements along with her Food Network cooking show, and publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook has been canceled. Deen attorney William Franklin's motion, filed Monday with the U.S. District Court in Savannah, cited the June 26 Supreme Court decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, the California case. ""Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts made this observation: Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding actual 'Cases' or 'Controversies,'"" the motion said. ""One essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so. This requires the litigant to prove that he has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision."" George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told CNN Tuesday the contention that the Prop 8 ruling is relevant to the Deen case won't hold water. The concept of standing is hardly new, and the Supreme Court bringing it into the spotlight in Hollingsworth v. Perry doesn't not advance Deen's motion to dismiss the case, Turley said. Deen's accuser: 'This has never been about the N-word' Lisa Jackson, the plaintiff in the suit against Deen is white, has no standing because she couldn't have suffered ""a personal and tangible harm"" from hearing the ""N-word"" on the job, the Franklin's , motion says. In the Prop 8 case, state officials refused to pursue an appeal when a federal judge struck down the same-sex marriage ban. Private citizens picked it up, ultimately to be told by the high court last week that they had no standing to do so. Jackson is a former manager at Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia. She is suing Deen and her brother, Bubba Hier, alleging they committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five-year employment at Deen's Lady & Sons and Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House eateries in Savannah. She gave a statement to CNN's Don Lemon through her lawyer, Matthew Billips, on Monday. ""This lawsuit has never been about the N-word,"" she said. ""It is to address Ms. Deen's patterns of disrespect and degradation of people that she deems to be inferior. I may be a white woman, but I could no longer tolerate her abuse of power as a business owner, nor her condonation of Mr. Hier's despicable behavior on a day-to-day basis. I am what I am, and I am a human being that cares about all races, and that is why I feel it is important to be the voice for those who are too afraid to use theirs."" Deen's lawyer has called the allegations false, and Deen has said she does not tolerate prejudice. Deen made an emotional appearance on NBC's ""Today Show"" last week in which she called the accusations ""horrible, horrible lies."" ""I believe that every creature on this Earth, every one of God's creatures, was created equal,"" she said. ""... I believe that everyone ought to be treated equal."" Deen was raised to never be unkind to anyone, she said. Opinion: We use Deen to give ourselves a pass .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen foiled an al Qaeda plot to capture oil and gas facilities and seize two key southern ports early this week, a spokesman for the prime minister said Wednesday. However, another Yemeni government official said it did not appear that the plot was the terror threat that prompted the United States on Tuesday to urge Americans to leave the country. That official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, downplayed the report of the plot disruption, saying that ""these are ongoing threats to oil and gas installations in Yemen."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ""has neither the manpower nor the capabilities to capture ports or seize pipelines,"" the official said. ""Security precautions are always in place regarding all oil installations and energy infrastructure in Yemen."" News of the foiled plot comes after the United States, acting on intelligence information, issued a worldwide travel alert and closed a number of embassies and consulates over large areas of the Middle East and Africa this week. Rajeh Badi, a spokesman for Yemen's prime minister, said that Yemen ""ended an al Qaeda plot to attack strategic locations in Mukalla and Shabwa,"" referring to a Yemeni port city and a southern province. ""Large numbers of government forces are making sure the Yemeni coasts are safe from any al Qaeda attack. Al Qaeda sought to attack the oil pipelines, but failed and tried to attack through the coast of Mukalla but failed as well,"" he said. However, the state news agency Saba denied there was ever an al Qaeda plot to take over Mukalla. It cited a security source it did not name. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that the U.S. Embassy there remains closed ""because we believe that a threat remains."" On Tuesday, two U.S. military transport aircraft landed in Yemen to evacuate American citizens. The UK Foreign Office has also withdrawn its embassy staff. A senior Yemeni Interior Ministry official told CNN that ""a few"" al Qaeda operatives arrived in Sanaa over the past three days, which has forced government authorities to put Yemeni forces on high alert. The official could not be named, as he is not authorized to speak to the media. ""We are confident that government security forces will be able to stop any attack from taking place in Sanaa, but the militants do have a good history of operating in Sanaa,"" he said Tuesday. ""It's not a secret that al Qaeda also has sleeper cells in Sanaa,"" the source said. Bergen: What's behind timing of terror threat . Evacuation troubles Yemen ministry . Psaki said Tuesday that the United States has ""a close partnership"" with Yemen and that Secretary of State John Kerry had spoken with President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi to thank him for his efforts. But in a sign of possible tensions with its international allies, Yemen's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the evacuation of embassies ""serves the interests of the extremists"" and undermined its efforts. List of U.S. embassies and consulates closed this week . ""Yemen has taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety and security of foreign missions in the capital Sanaa,"" a statement said Tuesday. ""While the government of Yemen appreciates foreign governments' concern for the safety of their citizens, the evacuation of embassy staff serves the interests of the extremists and undermines the exceptional cooperation between Yemen and the international alliance against terrorism."" Meanwhile, Sanaa residents told CNN of their concern about long-term security issues and fears of possible U.S. intervention in Yemen. University student Sara al-Shibani said she felt Yemen had no option but to concede to ""international powers,"" since the country is weak and poor. She also worries that ""many Yemenis will die because of ... foreign involvement in Yemeni politics."" ""The United States is making Yemenis feel that we are ... the next Afghanistan,"" said local banker Nasser al-Maqdashi. Drone strikes kill 6; helicopter shot down . Six militants in separate vehicles were killed in two drone strikes in Shabwa province Wednesday morning, according to several official sources in Yemen not authorized to be named. This was the fifth such strike in two weeks, and the second in Shabwa. A local security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that he does not believe any of those killed were senior al-Qaeda members. The latest strikes came a day after a pair of suspected U.S. drone strikes killed four al Qaeda militants in Yemen. Security sources told CNN about those strikes but didn't offer additional details. None of those killed Tuesday were among the 25 names on the country's most-wanted list, security officials said. It was unclear whether Tuesday's strikes were related to the security alert in place in the country since U.S. officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to operatives in Yemen telling them to ""do something."" The message was sent to Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of AQAP, the terror group's Yemeni affiliate. U.S. intelligence believes al-Wuhayshi has recently been appointed the overall terror organization's No. 2 leader. Security Clearance blog: What al Qaeda wants to do . Three sources told CNN that the United States has information that members of AQAP are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. Recent jailbreaks in Pakistan, Iraq and Libya all have the fingerprints of al Qaeda operations. Meanwhile, a Yemeni government official not authorized to speak to media told CNN that a Yemeni military helicopter was shot down in Mareb province Tuesday. He said that the helicopter had been inspecting the country's main oil pipeline -- one that has been subject to repeated attacks -- and added Wednesday that ""AQAP is now the prime suspect."" At least eight people were killed, including the 107th Brigade commander, six army escorts and at least one crew member, he said. AQAP's recent attacks have included a suicide bombing on a pro-government militia in the south in March that killed 12, and an attempted suicide bombing attack on a gas pumping facility in the port city of Balhaf in June. In July, several soldiers were killed by a bomb in Sanaa after a lull in attacks in the capital. AQAP has not mounted a large-scale suicide attack on Yemen's security forces since May 2012, when more than 100 soldiers were killed by a suicide bomber as they trained for a parade in Sanaa. Many of AQAP's operatives, including its leadership, retreated into remote areas after the Yemeni military offensive last year and regrouped. The Yemeni security forces, extensively reorganized under Hadi, have over the past 18 months recaptured swathes of territory that were briefly held by AQAP, particularly in the south of the country.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud party have agreed to form a unity government with the rival centrist political faction Kadima in a move that will put off elections until late next year and create one of the largest coalition governments in Israeli history. The deal was reached early Tuesday morning between Netanyahu and Kadima Party leader Shaul Mofaz, a day after Netanyahu had publicly called for early elections to be held September 4. Appearing together at a news conference Tuesday afternoon in the Knesset, the two leaders attempted to explain the sudden change in direction. ""When I thought the stability is rocking I was willing to go to elections,"" Netanyahu said. ""But when I found out that it is possible to create a broad, very broad government... I understood that we can bring back the state of stability without changing the time of elections."" Mofaz characterized the agreement as an ""historic opportunity"" for the government to put the public good before narrow political concerns. Both men said that the new coalition, made up of 94 of 120 Knesset members, would be better capable of addressing a variety of domestic and security concerns. The agreement calls for Mofaz to enter the government as a deputy prime minister and offers a number of Kadima Party members senior Knesset committee positions. Kadima will be given a leading role in redrafting a controversial law that provides an exemption for compulsory military service to ultra-orthodox men in Israel. Political disagreement over the sensitive issue was one of the major factors leading Netanyahu to push for early elections in September. Both men also identified upcoming budget negotiations, government reform and the need to restart talks with Palestinians as the most important goals of the new government. The unexpected move by Netanyahu upends the political calculations of smaller left-of-center parties and provides him with a comfortable governing coalition less sensitive to the demands of his current right-wing coalition partners. For Mofaz and his fellow Kadima members, the move buys another year in office without having to face voters amid sagging popularity ratings. What impact the new coalition could have on Israel's handling of Iran's nuclear program is not entirely clear. While a stable and unified Israeli government sends a strong signal to leaders in Tehran, Mofaz, a former military chief-of-staff and defense minister, has generally been less hawkish on Iran than Netanyahu and has expressed reservations about Israel taking unilateral military action against the Islamic republic's nuclear installations. ""This is not going to lead to a major change of policy on Iran,"" says Meir Javendanfar, an Iran expert at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. ""This is far more about domestic politics than Iran,"" Javendanfar said, adding, ""any decisions on Iran still depended greatly on the United States"" rather than a new governing coalition. The Knesset is likely to endorse the new coalition deal in the next two days.","The deal is reached early Tuesday morning .
The deal comes as Netanyahu called for early elections .
""Unity restores stability,"" Netanyahu says .

"Kogelo, Kenya (CNN) -- Four years ago this village was the center of ""Obama mania."" The celebration of 2008 ""was exceptional, it is something not any of us would have imagined to have happened because we were at the brink of history being made,"" said village resident Malik Obama, half-brother of the president. In 2008, Malik Obama peered into a tiny TV with a flickering CNN signal for an all-night vigil watching results come in. After a rain-soaked night that stranded more than a few reporters who had come to the village, Malik Obama emerged bleary-eyed but dancing. A crowd of supporters chanted his name. Kogelo is the birthplace of Barack Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. Then-Sen. Barack Obama visited in 2006 and paid special homage to his grandmother, Sarah Obama (now universally known as Mama Sarah). It's not just Sarah and Malik, there is a whole wing of the Obama clan here: cousins, aunts and half-cousins. If 2006 was the start of the love affair, in 2008 it went full-blown. Everywhere there were Obama T-shirts, DVDs and cakes (a black forest cake with an edible picture of the president-to-be and Mama Sarah was a favorite). Things have certainly cooled down since then. To many Africans (and Americans, if polls are correct), Barack Obama's presidential campaign of ""hope"" and ""change"" hit a wall of reality when he came into office. Africans, in particular, saw great hope in the new American president with African roots. But after just one brief swing through Ghana in four years at the White House, many feel let down by Africa's ""favorite son."" The administration contends that Africa is a priority, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been a regular fixture in Africa. But to Africans, and especially to Kenyans, it is not the same. ""Under the circumstances with what he has had to deal with we understand,"" said Malik Obama, ""and we hope that circumstances will change. We hope he has the opportunity to come here and say hello."" Even without a visit from President Obama, Kogelo is still trying to make good use of the connection. Where there was once just a dirt track running through town, now a paved road is nearing completion. Electricity is connected to many houses. Water projects have increased. Simply put, President Obama's win put Kogelo on the map. Locals here say that charities flooded into Kogelo to get a bit of the ""Obama cache."" With a tight race looming in 2012, many here are nervous. ""I donÂ¹t know the other person who is contesting,"" said Pastor Joseph Omundi of the Christian Life church in Kogelo, ""but we know Barack Obama is the son of this land."" Omundi, a fiery preacher who delivers sermons with a translator in a staccato double act, said his congregation has been praying for ""peace, the economy, and Barack Obama."" Everyone a CNN crew spoke to in Kogelo is for Obama: the fruit vendors; the commuters streaming by in matatu, or minibus, vehicles; and even the opinionated boda boda, or bicycle and motorcycle, drivers. Many just refer to Mitt Romney as ""the other guy."" While Kogelo has changed, with a new recreation center and lodge for foreign tourists, it is still just a rural village some 260 miles (418 kilometers) west of Nairobi, the capital. The flood of foreign visitors predicted by the government hasn't materialized, and the much-touted road isn't quite finished. But Malik Obama stays positive. ""Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States, but Kogelo is the capital of the world, because everybody comes to visit,"" he said.","The village of Kogelo was the birthplace of President Obama's father .

"(CNN) -- The Boston Athletic Association is providing an additional 9,000 spots in the 2014 Boston Marathon to accommodate runners who were unable to finish last year's race because of the terror attack bombings. Registration --- which opens at 10 a.m. Monday -- will operate under the same process used to qualify runners in the past, giving priority to the fastest qualifiers, according to Jack Fleming, a spokesman for the B.A.A. The 5,000 runners who were unable to finish the 2013 marathon are already pre-registered for the race, according to Fleming. Isabelle Goosen, who participated in the 2013 Boston Marathon and was half a mile away from completing the race before the attack, told CNN that she is excited to finally finish the race she started last year. ""I'll definitely get a sense of closure,"" Goosen said. ""It sounds almost selfish to look at everything that happened in this way but just the fact that I couldn't finish tore me a part for a while. Spending four months training for it and spending all of my college career wanting to do it. I was really upset."" Another addition to next year's race will be the planting of 100,000 daffodils along the marathon's entire route, according to Diane Valle, who began the group Marathon Daffodils. Marathon Daffodils, which has collaborated with several organizations and volunteer groups, plans to begin planting the flowers in October, according to Valle. ""We hope the bright yellow daffodil, which is the same color as the Boston Marathon logo, will lift people's spirits,"" Valle told CNN. ""We hope the communal act of planting together will strengthen Boston Strong and will add a bit of hope and rebirth."" The April 15, 2013, double bombings near the finish line killed three people and injured at least 264. The B.A.A. and Fleming acknowledge that the upcoming marathon is going to be considerably larger than previous years: ""We know that since April 15 the demand in the running community and those around Boston has increased. Interest is high."" The planning process for the 2014 marathon is currently ongoing, and updates to public safety are under way, according to Fleming. The 118th Boston Marathon will take place on April 21, 2014.","Additional runners will be in 2014 Boston Marathon .

"(CNN) -- He forged his views of war and the military as a young man in mine-plagued fields of Vietnam. Now Chuck Hagel may become the first Vietnam veteran and first enlisted soldier to serve as U.S. defense secretary. In nominating him to succeed Leon Panetta, President Barack Obama urged the Senate to confirm a man he said ""bears the scars"" of that war and has the skill to guide the military through new challenges. ""Chuck Hagel is the leader that our troops deserve,"" Obama said. If Hagel is confirmed, the Defense Department would be led by someone who advocated deep cuts to its budget. He's bucked his fellow Republicans in opposing troop surges in Iraq and Afghanistan, telling his biographer: ""I will do all I can to prevent war."" And he's come under fire over comments about Israel, a top American ally, and Iran, a top American foe. Read more: Who's in, who's out of cabinet . Those issues and others have assured that the former Nebraska senator's path to the Pentagon won't be easy. But Hagel said he's eager to answer critics. Until Obama's announcement that ended weeks of speculation over his nomination, Hagel told the Lincoln Journal Star newspaper in his home state that he'd been ""hanging out there in no-man's land unable to respond to charges, falsehoods and distortions"" about his record. Now, he said, he has ""an opportunity to set the record straight."" ""All I ask is a fair hearing, and I will get that,"" Hagel told the paper. ""I am very much looking forward to having a full, open, transparent hearing about my qualifications and my record."" Carl Levin, who will chair those hearings as head of the Armed Services Committee in the Democratic-controlled Senate, praised Hagel's qualifications and said the panel would give ""prompt and careful"" consideration to his nomination. What's really behind Hagel nomination fight . Iraq, Iran, gay rights among hot-button issues . Hagel, 66, said Monday that he was honored Obama had ""confidence in me and not unmindful of the immense responsibilities that go with it."" The current Georgetown professor and head of the Atlantic Council, a non-partisan international affairs group, praised troops who serve with ""such dignity and selflessness."" Hagel promised to work to ""strengthen our country's alliances and advance global freedom, decency and humanity"" in the effort to ""build a better world for all mankind."" At the same news conference where he announced the nomination of John Brennan as CIA director, Obama praised Hagel as a ""patriot"" who knows what it's like being on the frontline, in part from his year fighting alongside his brother in Vietnam. ""He understands that sending young Americans to fight and bleed in the dirt and mud is something that we only do when it's absolutely necessary."" Opinion: GOP, don't fight the Hagel nomination . The president, a Democrat, also said Hagel's selection ""represents the bipartisan tradition that we need more of in Washington."" But many in the GOP establishment begged to differ. ""He has long severed his ties with the Republican Party,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Sunday, when news surfaced that Hagel would be nominated. Sen. Chris Murphy, a freshman Democrat from Connecticut, countered that he believes ""Republicans are spoiling for a fight."" A host of issues swirling around Hagel have set the stage for a contentious confirmation hearing with Republicans expected to lead the charge against him. A few years after famously bucking his party in opposing a U.S. troop ""surge"" in Iraq, Hagel voted against sending 30,000 additional troops in 2009 to Afghanistan -- a move that put him at odds with Republicans and Obama. Some also are bothered by a comment he made in 1998 about an ambassadorial candidate James Hormel being ""openly, aggressively gay"" -- which he apologized for in December, 14 years later. This issue is compounded by the fact that Hagel could oversee a military that recently dropped its ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy for gay and lesbian personnel, a policy he supported. The Log Cabin Republicans, a group that supports gay rights, called the Hormel apology ""too little, too late."" Yet gay rights activist Rick Jacob stood behind Obama and said ""no one trying to derail (Hagel's) nomination attacks his qualifications."" Hagel has also come under fire over Iran. In addition to calling for talks with the Middle Eastern nation, which openly antagonizes Israel, Hagel has spoken out against certain sanctions -- a cornerstone of Obama's foreign policy aimed at pressuring Tehran over its nuclear program. The New York Times notes that Hagel was ""one of only two senators to vote against the Iran-Libya sanctions act in 2001, arguing that it would undercut efforts to engage with Tehran."" In a September editorial in the Washington Post, Hagel -- writing with several others, including retired Gen. Anthony Zinni and former Rep. Lee Hamilton -- said that he thinks ""all options (should be) on the table"" regarding Iran, a stance that aligns him with Obama, as well as many Republicans. GOP senator: Hagel would be 'antagonistic' toward Israel . But the most charged subject is likely Israel, with Graham arguing -- if confirmed -- Hagel ""would be the most antagonistic secretary of defense"" toward Israel ""in our nation's history."" Read more: Choice in Hagel sparks mixed reactions . Hagel has supported Israel entering negotiations with Hamas, the Islamist movement that oversees parts of the Palestinian territories and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, while also insisting that Hamas end terrorism and accept Israel's right to exist. He also was one of 12 senators who refused to sign a letter to the European Union trying to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization."" In 2007, Hagel joined two other senators in introducing a resolution in June 2007, pushing for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In an interview that year, Hagel said a ""Jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers"" -- sparking sharp criticism from some Jewish organizations and across the political spectrum. Graham has blasted what he calls ""an in-your-face nomination by the president to all of us who are supportive"" of Israel. But others have rallied around him, including his friend Rabbi Aryeh Azriel of Temple Israel in Omaha, Nebraska. Azriel, who grew up in Israel and says he's personally open for talks with Hamas and Hezbollah, praised Hagel as ""definitely a friend of Israel. He is independent, has wonderful, fresh ideas to try to reengage the discussion about the Middle East."" Hagel told the Journal Star there is ""not one shred of evidence that I'm anti-Israeli, not one (Senate) vote that matters that hurt Israel,"" claiming his critics have ""completely distorted"" his record. Read more: White House officials reach out to Jewish community to answer Hagel concerns . He emphasized his ""unequivocal, total support for Israel"" and support for tough international economic sanctions against Iran, the paper reported. Such fiery rhetoric has prompted presidential nominees in the past to pull out. But the bumpy road ahead is unlikely to faze Hagel. ""Chuck Hagel is not afraid of challenge -- or risk,"" his biographer, Charlyne Berens, wrote in 2006. Praise from Powell, criticism from Iraq vet . One high-profile Vietnam veteran standing by Hagel is Gen. Colin Powell, a former Joint Chiefs chairman who was secretary of state under the Republican administration of President George W. Bush. ""You can always count on him to analyze a difficult situation and take a position that reflects his best judgment,"" said Powell, a Republican who nonetheless had similarly endorsed Obama. ""I believe that more than ever we need that kind of independent and bold leader who thinks in and out of the box."" Gen. Wesley Clark, former NATO supreme allied commander, said Hagel has earned the president's trust. Hagel's experience in Vietnam, which earned him two Purple Hearts, gave him ""the proper appreciation for what it's like on the ground, at the bottom,"" Clark said. But Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is not supportive. ""Our troops deserve much better than a man who voted to send them to war when it was popular and then abandoned those very troops when it was unpopular,"" he said. He was referring to Hagel's 2002 vote authorizing the war in Iraq and his ultimate opposition to it. Willingness to speak his mind stirs criticism, support . If he becomes defense secretary, Hagel will be tasked with carrying out the orders of a president who concluded the war in Iraq and plans to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. Ending and avoiding war are part of what he committed his life to while in his 20s in Vietnam, Berens wrote. ""After a year of Vietnam's miserable heat, nearly constant danger, and violent campaigns like the Tet Offensive, Chuck Hagel came back to the United States ready to get on with things -- and with both a loyalty to the U.S. military and a belief he should do all he could to prevent his nation's being involved in another war."" Read more: Chuck Hagel's views on war forged by Vietnam experience . His fierce opposition to the Iraq War went far toward creating the schism that now exists between him and the GOP establishment. ""The damage this war has done to our country will play out for years to come,"" he wrote in his 2008 book, ""America: Our Next Chapter."" ""While it is easy for nations to blunder into war, they never blunder into peace,"" he added. Especially on foreign policy issues, Hagel has shown time and again his willingness to speak his mind -- even if it goes against the prevailing Republican thinking or, in the case of the 2009 Afghanistan surge, the position of Obama. His independence has spawned critics, as well as cheers. ""He's a guy with really serious foreign policy chops and someone, frankly, who hasn't been afraid to depart from his party when he thought they were wrong,"" Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, told CNN. Hagel himself said Monday that he won't hold back if he becomes defense secretary, telling Obama, ""I will always give you my honest and most informed council."" CNN's Mike Mount, Kevin Liptak, Jill Dougherty, and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.","Obama says the ex-senator from Nebraska is ""the leader that our troops deserve""

"(CNN) -- If you want to know why there's little cooperation in Washington these days, I'd start with a campaign promise made in 1988 by presidential candidate George H.W. Bush. ""Read my lips: No new taxes."" So, when he raised taxes two years later, quite naturally, voters, particularly conservatives, were upset. If you want to know why so little is being accomplished in Washington these days, I'd start with that broken promise and what Bush did in an attempt to get those conservatives back. He carried Rush Limbaugh's bags. That's right. In 1992, President Bush invited Limbaugh for a sleepover and personally brought his guest's bags into the Lincoln bedroom for him . They were not friends. In fact, Limbaugh didn't care for Bush that much, and ""41"" knew it. But Bush was seeking re-election. He was saddled with a slumping economy and locked in a tough battle with Gov. Bill Clinton and businessman Ross Perot. He believed he needed Rush Limbaugh. The party has been carrying Limbaugh's bags ever since. So, if you want to know when Washington became so polarized, maybe we should circle August 1, 1988, exactly 25 years ago. That was the day a satirical talk show host syndicated his act and, in the process, made a lot of money and became one of the most influential figures in American politics today. ""Have any of you heard of an individual by the name of LZ Granderson?"" Limbaugh asked on his show in June 2012. ""Snerdley? He has not heard of LZ Granderson. Dawn, have you? Brian, have you heard of LZ Granderson? Prior to last night I had not heard of LZ Granderson."" Which isn't true. In June 2011, Limbaugh brought me up on his show as well, going so far as to say, ""You can blame me, LZ Granderson, all you want, and I'll take it."" It only takes a few seconds on ""The Rush Limbaugh Show"" website to find out those facts. But Limbaugh isn't on the air to provide facts, he's there to entertain. Many of his listeners understand that. And many of them don't. A 1994 New York Times article leading into the midterm election called Limbaugh ""a kind of national precinct captain for the Republican insurgency of 1994"" and documented caller after caller legitimately asking the Mahi Rushie -- he calls himself that on occasion -- for guidance. Not much has changed. During the Affordable Health Care Act debate, callers were actually asking Limbaugh, a shock jock in the mold of Howard Stern, what was in the bill. He even threatened to move to Costa Rica if it was implemented, which seemed counterintuitive, considering Costa Rica has universal health care. But it's moments like that when you remember that Limbaugh's purpose isn't to provide thoughtful political discourse. It's to vent on his listeners' behalf, to appeal to their censored side. The side that wants to hear a white man say ""nigga"" in public or call a woman a ""slut"" without getting fired. If that makes you laugh, then he's doing his job. If that disgusts you, well that's his job, too. Limbaugh has had us on this yo-yo since the moment he assumed the role of Gabriel in the Kingdom of Reagan 25 years ago. Back then, it was only offensive, because he was the party's megaphone, warning listeners about the impending invasion of welfare queens with his mixture of righteous indignation and half-truths. It became destructive when listeners and politicians alike made him its spokesman: a pseudo-politician free from the burden of actually having to do anything. Like use facts. In rebutting the legitimacy of climate change, Limbaugh once told listeners the United States had more acreage of forest land today than at the time the Constitution was written. That wasn't true, of course, but it sounded good. Not too long ago, he read what he believed to be passages from Obama's senior thesis, passages that expressed a disdain for the U.S. Constitution. Sadly, the whole thing was made up by a blogger. And while Limbaugh did sheepishly tell listeners what he had read earlier was false, the host still found a way to justify reading it by saying, ""We know he thinks it."" Some folks eat that kind of stuff up. Some get riled up about it. And the folks in Washington? Well, after 25 years, they're still not quite sure what to do with it or him. If you're a Democrat, do you ignore him? If you're a Republican, do you carry his bags? I imagine it's like that feeling you get when someone tells you something that you can't determine is a joke or not. You just stand there half-smiling like an idiot. So, if you want to know what the folks in Washington are doing about the economy, I'd start there. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: President Bush in 1992, seeking Limbaugh's support, carried his bags .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A car bomb rocked a stronghold of the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah on Tuesday morning, injuring dozens of people in a southern suburb of the capital. Fifty-three people were hurt in the blast in the Bir El Abed neighborhood, Lebanese Health Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV. Thirteen of them remained hospitalized Tuesday afternoon in stable condition, he said. The blast erupted in a parking lot near the Islamic Cooperation Centre, a supermarket, the National News Agency reported. Video from the scene broadcast on Al-Manar showed vehicles ablaze, black smoke billowing aloft. Fire crews doused the flames as authorities kept the crowds back. The explosion affected the lower floors of surrounding buildings, blowing out windows and damaging balconies, NNA reported. Witnesses said that crowds hurled bottles at the interior minister, Marwan Charbel, as he was touring the site, and he fled. Syria's conflict stirs up old rivalries in Lebanon . Many of the injuries were minor, caused by glass debris, said Ali Krayyem, director general of Bahman Hospital, where many of the wounded were taken. Tensions have risen in recent months as thousands of fighters from the militant Shiite group Hezbollah have poured across the border into Syria and thousands of Syrian refugees have fled into Lebanon. With Hezbollah's support, forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad have regained momentum in his country's civil war. Recently they retook what had been a rebel stronghold, the city of Qusayr, which is located on a major supply route close to the Lebanese border. While that has helped turn the tide for Hezbollah's patrons, it has also angered many in Lebanon. Among those are Sunni Islamists, whose calls for Hezbollah to be stopped have grown in volume and number in recent days. Sectarian violence has been a growing concern as many Lebanese support al-Assad's embattled regime, while others do not. A big worry is that Syria's troubles will reopen the wounds of Lebanon's civil war, which raged from 1975-1990, potentially pitting the Sunni community, which tends to back the Syrian rebels, against Hezbollah, a powerful pro-Assad Shiite militia. This comes as evidence emerges that Syrian rebel groups are receiving small arms smuggled from Lebanon and Turkey. In April, the Lebanese army announced it had intercepted a cargo ship bound for Tripoli -- the northern epicenter of support for Syrian rebels in Lebanon -- that was filled with weapons it believes were meant to be delivered to rebel forces in Syria. CNN's Nada Husseini and Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Beirut, with Ed Payne and Tom Watkins reporting and writing in Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Deadly explosions rocked parts of Damascus on Saturday with some of the targets being Syrian government facilities, witnesses and state television reported. At least 27 people were killed and 97 others were wounded in two blasts, state TV reported, quoting Syrian Health Minister Wael Halki. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said early indications were that two booby-trapped cars exploded in crowded areas. It put the death toll at 24, with 140 people injured and serious damage caused to surrounding buildings. One explosion occurred near the customs criminal investigations department, witnesses said. Another struck near the Air Force intelligence headquarters in Tahrir Square in a different area of the city. State TV reports blamed the explosions on ""terrorists."" The explosion by the customs criminal investigations department was only a short distance from Umayyad Square, where state media reported Friday that huge numbers turned out to demonstrate in support of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The blast near the Air Force intelligence headquarters was close to where twin bombings struck the offices of two security branches in Damascus in December. The government blamed terrorists inside and outside of Syria, but the opposition called the attacks the work of the regime. The capital was hit by another blast in January. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) of Syria, an opposition activist network, reported seeing a large white cloud of smoke hanging above Damascus Friday. Twenty-two people were killed elsewhere in Syria Saturday, the LCC said, including a child, two military defectors and two people under torture. The child, 11, died in the city of Raqqa when security forces fired on a funeral procession, the LCC said. Eight other deaths occurred in Raqqa and five in Homs, the LCC said, with others reported in Jabal al-Zawiyah, the town of Tremseh, in Hama province, and Inkhel, in Daraa province. Opposition activists also spoke about the aftermath of an attack in the Rifai district of Homs province this week, in which they said at least 32 children and two women were found, most of them injured. ""The children were tortured -- beaten, abused, fingers cut off, and shot by thugs,"" said Waleed Faris. Faris is a pseudonym. An activist identified only as Abu Faris was part of a rescue operation in Rifai. He described seeing abandoned neighborhoods, ""tens of bodies"" and ""horrific corpses, shot, mutilated -- everywhere."" The latest violence comes a day after Kofi Annan, special joint U.N-Arab League envoy, briefed the U.N. Security Council Friday on the Syrian crisis via a private teleconference. Speaking to reporters afterward from Geneva, Annan said he was working hard to stop the yearlong violence in Syria and ""get unimpeded access"" for humanitarian relief. ""I'm doing my best with the support of everyone to try to find a peaceful solution,"" Annan said. ""The Syrian people want to get on with their lives. They are tired and they suffered a lot."" He said U.N. humanitarian agencies are to arrive in Syria this weekend ""if they are not there already, to start their mission with the Syrian government."" The former U.N. secretary-general said the situation in Syria is ""much more complex"" than that in Libya or other nations. ""It's a conflict in a region of the world that has seen many, many traumatic events. I think we need to handle the situation in Syria very, very carefully,"" he said. ""Any miscalculation that leads to major escalation will have impact in the region."" Asked about the prospects of a coalition government, Annan said such a development would have to emerge from talks among Syrians. U.N. Security Council members are backing Annan's efforts, said Mark Lyall Grant, the British ambassador to the United Nations and the current council president. Grant didn't disclose details about the meeting but told reporters the session was ""comprehensive."" Bashar Jaafari, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, also told reporters that ""Syria is committed to making Mr. Annan's mission successful."" Annan met last weekend with the Syrian president in Damascus and the Syrian opposition in Turkey in an effort to end the violence that has swept the nation since Syrian security forces cracked down on protesters a year ago. He described the atmosphere in the talks as ""welcoming and correct."" Most reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. But al-Assad's regime has said ""armed terrorist groups"" are behind the bloodshed in Syria and says it has popular support for its actions. The Syrian government Friday underscored its position on terror in letters to top U.N. officials, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. It said it was protecting its citizens from ""terrorists"" who are slaughtering and murdering ""innocent citizens."" The government said Syria is working to find a political solution to the crisis and wants to cooperate with Annan. More than 8,000 people have died in the conflict, according to the United Nations, but opposition activists say the overall toll is more than 9,000, most of them civilians.

"(CNN) -- The 30-year-old suburban Chicago husband being sought in the stabbing death of his new bride told an associate he was heading to Mexico, where his parents live, according to an FBI affidavit released Friday. Charged with first-degree murder, Arnoldo Jimenez of Burbank, Illinois, was tracked using his phone in southern Illinois near Memphis, Tennessee, through Arkansas to Houston and then to Hidalgo, Texas, near the Mexican border at 10:45 p.m. Sunday, the same day police found his new bride murdered in her home, the affidavit said. On Sunday, Jimenez told his sister by phone that he and Estrella Carrera, 26, ""had a bad fight, and he left her bleeding,"" FBI Special Agent R. Brian Wentz said in an affidavit. Jimenez also told ""a close associate"" that he was leaving Illinois and ""if questioned by law enforcement, the associate should tell law enforcement he went to Mexico,"" Wentz said in the affidavit, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago. The Cook County State's Attorney's Office will extradite Jimenez upon his arrest, the FBI said. The FBI has joined the search for Jimenez, now the subject of an international manhunt, and a federal warrant charging Jimenez with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution was issued Friday in U.S. District in Chicago, said FBI Special Agent Ross Rice. Jimenez, born in Texas, still owns property in Pharr, Texas, and also has relatives in North Carolina, the FBI affidavit said. Carrera, found stabbed to death in her bathtub, was still in the sequined cocktail dress she wore to her wedding reception, police said. Jimenez and Carrera were married May 11 at Chicago City Hall, according to authorities. Carrera's cousin Sandy Lopez told CNN affiliate WBBM that the couple had been together for three years. They celebrated their union with family and friends with dinner and a limo ride to at least one nightclub on the city's north side, according to police. The newlyweds were dropped off about 4 a.m. Saturday at their condominium in a three-story brick building, police said. ""She was happy. She was fine. Did nothing out of the ordinary at all,"" Lopez told WBBM. About 36 hours later, police found Carrera's body after responding to a call from a family member concerned that there might be something wrong. Carrera had failed to pick up her two children, ages 2 and 8, as scheduled the day before, police said. There were no signs of forced entry at her home, police said. ""It is important to know that this appears to be an isolated incident stemming from a domestic situation and the investigation is continuing,"" police said this week. Lopez told WBBM she had ""no idea why somebody would do this to her."" The 6-foot, 225-pound Jimenez was last seen driving a black 2006 Maserati.

"(CNN) -- A group of former top counternarcotics officials are taking on Attorney General Eric Holder over the Justice Department's decision to soften its stance on marijuana legalization. Nine former administrators of the Drug Enforcement Administration wrote Holder to criticize the department's decision not to challenge laws in Colorado and Washington state, which are allowing legal recreational use of marijuana after voter-approved ballot measures. More than two dozen other states and the District of Columbia allow medicinal use of marijuana. The Justice Department last month issued new guidelines to prosecutors intended to focus on more serious trafficking offenses, largely avoiding a conflict with state laws. The federal government still classifies marijuana as one of the most dangerous substances, and it remains illegal under federal law. Buoyed by the Justice Department's move and by public polls showing increasing voter support, pro-marijuana activists are now looking to the ballot box to legalize marijuana in more states. The nine former DEA chiefs, who span the years of the U.S. Drug War dating to the 1970s, aren't moved by changing public opinion on the issue. In the letter dated Monday, they say they were ""shocked and dismayed"" by Holder's move. ""You took an oath of office, as each of us did, to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" the former DEA officials say. ""Great harm will be done in Colorado and Washington and throughout the country with the legalization of marijuana."" The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.","Former DEA leaders criticize Justice Department's approach to legal marijuana in 2 states .

"Guangzhou, China (CNN) -- In a voice alternating between desperate and hopeful, Qu Feifei talked to her daughter continuously Tuesday afternoon through a window left ajar at the main military hospital in this southern Chinese city. ""Yueyue, give Mom another chance to love you, OK?"" she finally begged, sobbing. On the other side of the window, two-year-old Wang Yue -- affectionately known as Yueyue -- lay almost lifeless in bed inside the intensive care unit, with netting around her head and a respirator covering her small face. The toddler was gravely injured in two successive hit-and-run incidents last Thursday not far from her father's hardware store in the nearby city of Foshan. When CNN visited the scene Tuesday evening, the blood stains had long gone but two circled numbers on the ground made with black markers clearly indicated the locations of both collisions. Wang's condition remained critical, her brain showing little activity despite some earlier subtle movements in the lower body, her mother said. Gruesome security camera footage of the accidents and the girl, lying in her own blood, ignored by more than a dozen passersby in a busy market has outraged the nation, stirring an emotional debate on the state of morality in a fast-changing society. On Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, the story continued to be the No. 1 topic after generating more than 4.5 million posts along with a ""stop apathy"" online campaign. While the initial video went viral on Chinese Internet, state-run newspapers and television stations have since seized on the story, turning their spotlight on an unlikely hero as well as many villains. Opinion: Incident in China shows 'volunteer's dilemma' Chen Xianmei, a 58-year-old scavenger who was seen in the video moving Wang to safety, became an instant symbol of understated decency in a nation that many netizens say has become obsessed with climbing up the economic ladder. Camera crews chased Chen for interviews, while local government and businesses fought to award her money. ""I didn't think of anything at the time,"" she told local reporters Sunday. ""I just wanted to save the girl."" Chen's overnight celebrity, however, appeared too overwhelming for her. Her neighbors told CNN Tuesday night she had gone home to the countryside with her son. Domestic media also tracked down some of the passersby in the video. While several denied seeing Wang lie on the ground, one pedestrian told Yangcheng Evening News that she noticed a girl crying next to a pool of blood. ""I went to the closest store and asked a young man there if she was his child, but he said no,"" the newspaper quoted her as saying. ""Nobody else dared to touch her, how did I?"" ""This is sort of classic bystander effect, where people have a diffusion of responsibility,"" Wendy Walsh, a psychologist based in Los Angeles, commented on CNN. Wang's mother said in tears that she still couldn't comprehend the behavior of the passersby but wanted to focus on the positive. ""Granny Chen represents the best of human nature,"" Qu said of her daughter's rescuer at the scene. ""It's the nicest and most natural side of us."" Despite rising concerns over China's declining morality after the story broke, humanity now shines at the Guangzhou hospital where Wang is being treated. A steady procession of well-wishers surrounds her family throughout the day, offering gifts, money and support. ""I'm so grateful for all the nice people,"" Qu said. ""Yueyue won't let them down. ""I know my girl -- she's strong and she'll wake up again.""","""Give Mom another chance to love you,"" the unconscious child's mother begs .

"(CNN) -- It's the Miss America beauty pageant, but not as you know it. The swimsuit competition is out, volatile farm animals are in, and there are enough leather dresses to furnish a small sofa store. Hold onto your hats and saddle-up because this is Miss Rodeo America. The roughest, toughest beauty pageant in the country, where leather-clad ladies must not only display poise, beauty and knowledge -- but gutsy horsemanship. As 1973 queen Pam Minick said: ""Miss Rodeo America is the ultimate cowgirl -- wholesome, beautiful and tough as nails."" So what does it take to wear the coveted cowgirl crown? Child's play . For reigning Miss Rodeo America, 23-year-old Chenae Shiner, the journey to rodeo royalty began as a youngster growing up on her parents' ranch in Roosevelt, Utah. ""Both my parents participated in rodeo and I started competing in youth associations when I was six,"" she told CNN, adding: ""I started 'queening' when I was eight years old, going through the ranks of different county titles."" The bubbly blonde took the title of Miss Rodeo Utah last year. Then it was on to Las Vegas' glittering MGM Grand Hotel for the Miss Rodeo America pageant, held as part of the annual National Finals Rodeo -- or as Shiner described it: ""The Superbowl of Rodeo."" Las Vegas lock down . Here, 31 glamorous girls aged between 18 and 25, spend a week strutting their Wild West wardrobe, answering questions on everything from world politics to equine science, and riding horses in a packed arena. The first major test for many of the girls however, is coping with the intense scrutiny without the comforts of home. ""Once you arrive you're not allowed to speak to family or friends. You have to turn in your cell phone,"" explained Shiner. ""As Miss Rodeo America you travel a lot on your own, and the judges want to see you can handle that pressure."" No horsing around . Miss Rodeo America must be many things -- pretty, personable and educated. But above all she must be a master horse rider able to perform at hundreds of rodeo events across the country. Rodeo has a grand tradition in the southern agricultural states of America, where cowboys and girls compete in various livestock challenges such as calf roping and bronco riding. Indeed, many talented cowboys have turned their hand to professional horse racing, such as multimillion dollar jockey Steve Hamilton from Oklahoma who started out in the rodeo ring before moving to the race track. While other traditional beauty pageant contestants might show off their special talent by singing or playing the piano, Miss Rodeo America must demonstrate her superior riding skills by jumping on the back of a horse she's never seen before, and performing a set routine in front of hundreds of spectators. ""To prepare before the contest, I asked people in my home town if I could ride their horse,"" said Shiner. ""As Miss Rodeo America you're traveling 100,000 miles across the country performing at rodeos -- and many of those are full of horses you're not familiar with."" Ladies in leather . But it's not enough to just prove yourself in the saddle. The ultimate cowgirl also has to look the part -- and that means rhinestones, tassels and a lot of leather. Gazing at the ladies lined up on MGM's grand stage is a bit like coming face-to-face with a human rainbow of bejeweled leather, each carefully crafted costume topped-off with an obligatory cream cowboy hat. As Shiner says: ""A rodeo queen always has a leather dress in her wardrobe. It's a good western heritage dress."" The fashion segment of the pageant also gives the girls a chance to design an outfit and ""put their own personality in to it."" Shiner opted for a bronze, floor-length leather dress with rhinestones and tassel trim. Fit for a queen . Of course the ladies aren't just judged on their fashion choices -- but how they look in them. This, after all, is a beauty pageant, with each contestant an immaculate vision of glossy make-up, blow-dried hair and mega-watt smile. ""We are the face of rodeo, so you always want to be representing yourself in the best way possible,"" said Shiner. ""I don't believe it exploits women. There's more behind it than a pretty face -- we have to be well-spoken, knowledgeable, and it's a great way to further our education and career."" Rodeo riches . For radiology student Shiner, winning the crown was a childhood dream come true, but also the beginning of a year-long commitment involving up to 200 appearances across the country. She'll return to university next year with $22,500 in scholarship prize money, and plans to pursue a degree in business and marketing. It can be hard spending so much time on the road away from family and friends. But Shiner also takes her job as role model to younger girls very seriously. ""Miss Rodeo America was formed as a way to bring a little bit of beauty and grace to a sport known for its roughness and rowdiness,"" she says, adding: ""But you still have to be prepared to get dirt in your nails.""","Introducing Miss Rodeo America -- the ""ultimate cowgirl""

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's prime minister chaired an emergency meeting Monday after the worst violence to hit the North African nation since its revolution in February, promising a probe into what happened and vowing to ban all discrimination based on religion, language, gender or ethnicity. The National Justice Committee meeting comes on the heels of clashes Sunday night involving army troops and pro-Coptic Christian protesters that left at least 25 people dead and 272 wounded, a health ministry official said Monday. Reports indicated the death toll could be as high as 29 in violence that an army spokesman speculated may have been guided by a ""hidden hand"" associated with neither side. Many of those killed were crushed by speeding military vehicles, said Dr. Adel al-Dawi of the ministry. Those at Monday's meeting deemed the incident shocking and said it marked a ""serious escalation"" in tensions in Egypt, according to a statement from Prime Minister Essam Sharaf's office. It urged political and religious leaders to together take responsibility for the nation's security, while alluding to possible threats from conspiracies and sedition. Specifically, the committee established a fact-finding commission that will look at the incident and punish those responsible. It also set a two-week deadline to establish a framework for a law to mandate a uniform process for permitting and construction of houses of worship -- regardless of religious denomination. The committee also said the government would institute a law imposing jail time and a fine on anyone found guilty of discriminating against others based on religion, language, gender or ethnicity. Hours earlier, Sharaf acknowledged the divisions, and mounting security concerns, in a speech on state television. ""Instead of going forward, we found ourselves scrambling for security,"" the minister said, noting that the incident had produced ""martyrs, both civilian and from the military."" Tensions remained high Monday, as hundreds of Coptic Christians rallied outside a hospital, chanting, ""The army has its tanks, but we have our prayers."" Some Muslims attended the rally in an expression of solidarity with Christians. Egyptian security sources said stones were thrown at the rally, but a CNN reporter saw no evidence of that. Elsewhere in Cairo late Monday, another crowd of Muslim demonstrators gathered, chanting, ""Muslimiya! Muslimiya!"" to express their unhappiness with the Copts. Sunday's violence was an escalation after months of rising sectarian tension between Muslims and the Coptic Christian minority. September 30 destruction at a Coptic church site in southern Egypt heightened emotions. The Copts protested Sunday to demand that the military provide equal protection for Coptic places of worship. How the violence broke out was unclear. Some protesters said stones were thrown by people in civilian garb who were carrying sticks and machetes. Alla Mahmoud, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said that some protesters began ""firing live ammunition at the army."" Demonstrators said they were marching peacefully toward the Egyptian state television building when the violence erupted. ""Suddenly, we were attacked by thugs carrying swords and clubs,"" protester Magdi Hanna told CNN on Sunday. The January 25 youth revolution coalition, which has been involved in various anti-government protests, including Sunday's demonstration, denied that any participants shot at the Egyptian forces. Samir Bolos, one of the demonstrators, added Sunday that ""some unknown people may have fired at the army, but not us."" Witnesses said the army fired on the protesters near the state television headquarters. Meanwhile, military trucks could be seen burning on the street. Sherif Doss, head of Egypt's association of Coptics and a spokesman for the Coptic Church, said 17 civilians died and 40 were wounded in the altercation. He said the church's highest official, Pope Shenuda III, denounced the violence and blamed it on outsiders. ""Strangers infiltrated the demonstration and committed the crimes for which the Copts have been blamed,"" the church said in a statement. Twelve army troops were killed and more than 50 were wounded, according to Lt. Col. Amr Imam, a military spokesman. He said this was ""first time protesters fired at the army."" ""There must be a hidden hand behind this,"" Imam said. ""Egyptians don't do that."" Doss said he and other Coptics ""demand that the army checks the bullets used on the killed soldiers. They are probably military bullets. We do not have weapons."" Though individual Muslim women outside a hospital wiped tears from the cheeks of Coptic women whose relatives died Sunday, it was unclear whether -- at a state level -- the military-run government has the will to address the problem or the wherewithal to run a country of nearly 90 million people. In May, during another outbreak of sectarian violence, a National Justice Committee was formed to mitigate sectarian strife. Several committee members resigned in protest, saying they government has done too little to address the mounting problems. Since then-President Hosni Mubarak's ouster in February, the country remains unstable. The economy is struggling, tourism has yet to rebound and the stock market has dropped. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, U.S. President Barack Obama, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and British Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed concern about Sunday's violence. ""Now is a time for restraint on all sides so that Egyptians can move forward together to forge a strong and united Egypt,"" the White House press secretary said in a statement. ""As the Egyptian people shape their future, the United States continues to believe that the rights of minorities -- including Copts -- must be respected, and that all people have the universal rights of peaceful protest and religious freedom."" The statement noted that Sharaf has called for an investigation. ""These tragic events should not stand in the way of timely elections and a continued transition to democracy that is peaceful, just and inclusive,"" it said. Ashton said Monday that she was ""extremely concerned by the large number of deaths and injuries,"" while Hague condemned the loss of life. Coptic Christians, an ancient sect, make up about 9% of Egypt's population, according to the U.S. State Department. They have suffered serious violence in recent months. A Coptic church in the city of Alexandria was bombed on New Year's Day, killing 23 people -- the deadliest attack on Christians in Egypt in recent times. Clashes involving Coptic Christians in May left at least 12 dead. Egypt's Coptic Christians base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion split with other Christians in the 5th century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent bipartisan federal agency, added Egypt this year to a list of countries named as the worst violators of religious freedom. There has also been mutual support between the minority Christians and majority Muslims in Egypt, with reports of Christians protecting anti-Mubarak Muslim demonstrators when they stopped for daily prayers during the uprising.

"(CNN) -- Temperatures reached 94 degrees by noon in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday and were expected to keep climbling as a record heat wave gripped the Pacific Northwest. Children take relief from the heat in Seattle, where temperatures reached 94 degrees Wednesday. ""One-hundred is the all-time record for Seattle for any day, for any month, for any year,"" according to Cliff Mass, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington. But cranking up the air conditioning isn't an option for many in Seattle. ""We're really not prepared for it,"" Mass said. ""Most homes don't have air conditioning and a lot of stores don't. This is not like the East Coast or the Southwest. Temperatures generally in the summer are only in the 70s. Eighties are considered pretty warm."" Mass' weather blog -- cliffmass.blogspot.com -- warns that heat kills more people around the world every year than storms do. With current temperatures, evenings don't provide much relief, either. Because of unusually high humidity, temperatures haven't been dropping to the typical mid- to high-50s. Seattle had a high of 97 degrees on Tuesday, tying its all-time high recorded in 1998. Tuesday's low matched the record of 69 degrees. The temperature in Olympia, Washington, was 101 degrees Tuesday, exceeding the previous high of 100 in 1998, according to the National Weather Service. The heat wave has lasted several days, which is also unusual. What Mass calls the onshore push -- a surge of air from over the Pacific Ocean -- typically cools the area after a few days. Those winds are expected Friday. Oregon also is feeling the heat and posting record highs. It was 106 degrees in Portland on Tuesday, eclipsing the previous high of 101, which was set in 1998. It was 108 in Medford, 3 degrees above the 105-degree record set in 2003; and Salem was 107, exceeding the 2003 record of 99. Libba Letton, a spokeswoman for Whole Foods Market, said the chain's Portland stores were passing out free water.
