"Fukushima, Japan (CNN) -- Takashi Suzuki peels on his wet suit and looks out to sea. The waves are good and the water's not too crowded, with only a dozen or so other surfers riding the waves. Suzuki has been surfing these waters since he was in his 20s -- he's now 59. Not even the fact this beach is only 31 miles (50 kilometers) south of the crippled Fukushima Daichi nuclear power plant deters him. ""The radiation levels here are low,"" he says. ""The data says so, so all I can do is believe it. But I won't let my children or grandchildren go in the water."" Tokyo Electric Power Company, the plant's operators, have been struggling to contain leaks from tanks holding toxic water, with dangerously high levels of radiation detected at the site. TEPCO also revealed that hundreds of tons of radioactive water seeps into the Pacific Ocean every day. On Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit the site less than two weeks after announcing that the government would be spending US$470 million to try to tackle the emergency. Read more: Why Fukushima is worse than you think . The crisis began in 2011, when three of the plant's reactors suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami. But the world's worst nuclear disaster in 25 years has had a lasting impact -- it has evicted people from their homes and destroyed livelihoods, including Suzuki's fishing business. He doesn't believe he'll be able to fish these waters again in his lifetime. And now he's trapped here. ""Everything came to a halt and it is very bad for us, in a business sense and mentally. I have a family business but don't think I can ever go back to work. ""Lots of people want to leave this area. I want to leave as well but I can't because my life and money are all tied up here."" Half an hour's drive away is one of the temporary housing estates that sprung up after tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the vicinity of the plant. Residents here know the word ""temporary"" is misleading. Many moved in more than two years ago and assume they will be here for years to come. In an attempt to restore some normality to their lives, small gardens have been planted on the meter of rocky ground that surrounds the small plot and satellite dishes have been attached to the side of some of the modest wood cabins. Yoshikatsu Matsumoto moved here with his wife shortly after the disaster. All of their money was invested in their dream retirement home -- a house he doubts they will ever live in again. He knows even if he and his wife can move back, his children and grandchildren are unlikely to even visit. He says that's no way to live. ""We need to draw a line at some point rather than decontaminating,"" he says. ""I think residents of towns close to the nuclear plant should migrate to a new place and start a new life. It's a highly sensitive issue that angers some residents and local politicians who refuse to give up hope of returning home. But Matsumoto is tired of waiting for his life to begin again.

The older generation is thinking 'if their children don't go back why should they?' Now is the time to decide what to do,"" he says. ""This can never be home sweet home,"" he adds, referring to their temporary housing. ""If it is ever possible for us to go home, the government needs to do everything to make that happen and accept the help of the world. This accident killed the dreams of 150,000 people. They must do everything they can to try and salvage some dreams."" The government has been trying to decontaminate the outer parts of the original 12.4-mile (20-kilometer) exclusion zone. By the end of this fiscal year, the clean-up bill will have reached $1.5 billion. It's painstaking work. On any given day, an estimated 8,000 people work to clean up the area, carefully removing the top layer of soil and grass to try and remove as much absorbed radiation as possible. Only on the outskirts of the evacuation area are residents permitted to return home for short periods. But the evacuation order remains at night, a sign that the government remains concerned about accumulative radiation exposure.","Takashi Suzuki surfs in water near crippled Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan .

"(CNN) -- A revolution squeezed into its margins -- but that's where it started. It is February 11, 2014. Three years ago today, I walked to Tahrir Square to celebrate the fall of a dictator. In that square, we felt everything was possible, after Mubarak's 30-year rule. It's that feeling a recent film, ""The Square"" tried to capture. I resisted watching this Oscar-nominated film for weeks. I was in Egypt for many of the events it portrayed, and I knew I'd be emotionally riven if the film were even partially accurate. Indeed, it was painful to watch a film that captured so many of the core emotions of the past three years, and did it so well. The film did not portray my own memories: it mediated the emotional history of the revolution through the subjective experiences of certain key characters. They were all archetypes of the revolution. I wondered -- would the filmmakers do what so many writers on Egypt have done, and go for the easy way out, focusing on spoiled rich kids, playing revolutionary? They didn't -- the first revolutionary character, Ahmad, is hardly rich -- he's a young, middle class, average Egyptian. Another central character is Magdy -- a loyal member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the political Islamist group. Ahmad has struggled economically his whole short life -- Magdy has spent time imprisoned for his political beliefs. There was betrayal. It began with Mubarak himself, addressing the youth of Tahrir with such tenderness -- only to try to crush them. It continued with the military's leadership saluting the revolution's martyrs after Mubarak was forced from office -- only to be shown, unsympathetically, displaying singular disinterest in revolutionary reforms. It lingered with the Brotherhood's leadership insisting on revolutionary intentions -- only to be seen deserting the revolutionary struggle for partisan power. There was hope. The hope that all of Egypt would become Tahrir Square of the 18 days: a place of respect, pluralism, and freedom. Those that had hope now strive to ensure the hope itself doesn't die. There was anger, as we see the potential of the revolution squandered -- and the anger remains. There was naivetÃ© -- the naivetÃ© of the revolutionaries to understand where their power was, and where it wasn't. On the second anniversary of the uprising, I was near Tahrir Square trying to convince some activists that, actually, they'd lost the public's support for protests some time before. The protest, for too many of them, had become the strategy itself, as opposed to a tactic for a better-defined goal. Considering the film's partiality to the ideals of revolution, I was pleasantly surprised to see the idealism of one of the characters, Egyptian-Briton Khalid, challenged, more than once. Ahmad shows an innocent unwariness about the June 30 protests against then-President Mohamed Morsy: the film would have benefited from showing a counter to his exceedingly ill-placed confidence that the military of 2013 would be more restrained than the military of 2011. There was pain. There was the killing of largely Christian protesters at Maspero by the military in late 2011 -- a tragedy the film crew witnessed, and which turned a sizeable number against the military. There have now been more than a dozen ""mass protester killings,"" as the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights put it -- and no acknowledgement or justice for them. The single worst incident was the clearing of the pro-Morsy sit-in -- a scene insufficiently covered in the film, though mentioned. The film is not the story of every Egyptian, or even every revolutionary. It's a mediation of the revolutionary experience through these specific characters. The film is a story of the relationships of these individual characters with the revolution, and with each other. Even though this is a deeply political film, political parties are rarely shown. Central, nevertheless, to the film's development, is the persona of Magdy, a loyal Brotherhood member. He humanizes ordinary Brotherhood members, and of all the central characters, we know Magdy as the most tortured, who suffered the most under Mubarak's regime. Magdy's story is a profoundly conflicted one, as he struggles between his loyalty to an organization that supported him his whole life, and his ideals. His story causes others to be conflicted as well -- we see that although Ahmad opposes the Brotherhood deeply, he wants to come to the pro-Morsy sit-in towards the end, to stand by Magdy. A deeply sympathetic and gallant character, Magdy survives the clearing of the sit-in, unlike the many hundreds who did not. The film certainly prioritizes a revolutionary lens, rather than pretending to be a bland chronicle, for these tragic revolutionary heroes provided the context of the square and the revolution. Watching it now reminds us that in the past few months and years, many who would have been in that square would have been killed, or imprisoned. The film reminds us of a revolution that has been squeezed into the margins -- but also reminds us that, indeed, is where the revolution itself started.

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- A growing chorus of international agencies is calling for South Sudan's warring factions to cease hostilities. A day after East African leaders warned both the fledgling country and its rebel group to lay down their arms within four days, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon threw his weight behind that ultimatum from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). In a statement released Saturday, Ban said he lauded IGAD for ""appointing a mediation team to work with the government of south Sudan and opposition in reaching a cease-fire, the release of the detainees and building toward a process of peaceful dialogue."" ""The United Nations stands with the people of South Sudan and will continue to do everything within its means to protect civilians at risk and provide necessary humanitarian assistance,"" the U.N. statement continued. ""All violence, attacks and human rights abuses must end immediately. The Secretary-General reminds those responsible that they will be held accountable. He calls on the government and all concerned to ensure the rights and security of civilians are protected."" It's unclear what the repercussions would be for either side if they refuse the demands. A communique issued Friday in Nairobi, Kenya, appears to throw IGAD's weight behind South Sudanese President Salva Kiir, whose government has said that it would come to the negotiating table without preconditions. Kiir has accused rival politician Riek Machar, his former vice president, of trying to stage a coup-- a claim Machar has denied. Kiir's Vice President, James Wani Igga, says Machar will make it difficult for both sides to meet IGAD's truce deadline. ""Dr. Riek has put obstacles to this genuine call by issuing preconditions: namely that the cease-fire or peace cannot be reached unless a negotiation is conducted, and added a number of obstacles,"" the South Sudanese Vice President said Saturday. Kiir and Machar are longtime rivals from two different tribal clans. Kiir is from the Dinka tribe, Machar from the Neur. Fighting broke out between Kiir's government and supporters of Machar on December 15 in the capital city of Juba. It quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings lent credence by mass graves. Worried about the safety of medical staff and facilities, Doctors Without Borders is also asking both sides to alleviate ""the volatile and rapidly evolving security situation."" The international aid group says it has provided medical care to approximately 40,000 people who have fled to two U.N. bases in Juba since the latest wave of violence began. The U.N. says more than 63,000 total civilians are now crowded onto its compounds across South Sudan. Even though a curfew is in place in Juba, and though the capital has been relatively safe and stable compared to other parts of South Sudan for the past week or so, scared and beleaguered civilians have refused to leave the U.N. compounds. On Friday, 72 peacekeepers arrived in Juba, according to the United Nations. It was the first group of an additional 5,500 peacekeepers approved by U.N. Security Council. The additional personnel will increase the total peacekeeping force in South Sudan to 12,500 soldiers and 1,323 police officers. CNN's Arwa Damon and journalist Mading Ngor reported from Juba, South Sudan, and CNN's Mark Morgenstein wrote this story in Atlanta.","U.N.

"Washington (CNN) -- House conservatives are putting House Speaker John Boehner on notice: The 2014 agenda needs to be about more than railing on the President and the failures of Obamacare. They say it's time to lay out a bold GOP vision and hold votes on a series of issues to show a contrast with Democrats. ""Republicans right now think that all we have to do is talk about how bad the Obama economy is and how bad Obamacare is and we're going to win in 2014,"" Idaho GOP Rep. Raul Labrador told reporters at a forum of House conservatives on Capitol Hill this week. Labrador said he believes this strategy is what prevented Republicans from winning the White House in 2012 and predicted if the party adopts the same game plan this year it won't take back the Senate or win the White House in 2016. Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who heads a group of more than 170 conservatives called the Republican Study Committee, also said he's worried top GOP leaders don't have a more proactive agenda ahead of the midterm elections. ""There's some people that think that they might want to play prevent defense this year and sit back,"" Scalise said. In rare bipartisan action, Congress approves $1.1 trillion budget . Since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, those on the right have wielded their growing numbers and influence to stymie Boehner's plans on major policy debates. As Republicans head to the eastern shore of Maryland for a closed-door retreat later this month to chart strategy, Wyoming GOP Rep. Cynthia Lummis said. ""This is no time to duck in a foxhole. This is the time for Republicans to lead."" Boehner has said he believes the 2014 election will hinge on jobs and the problems with Obamacare. House Republican leaders are again expected to push similar versions of the jobs bill they pushed in 2013 to keep the focus on the economy, along with some more bills tweaking Obamacare, according to GOP aides. But Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, a tea party favorite who is retiring this fall, said, ""That's not enough,"" and House Republicans need to give more concrete answers for what they'll do for working-class Americans. ""You can chew gum and walk at the same time,"" Bachmann said. Obama makes case for not adding sanctions on Iran . Asked about conservatives' demands for votes on a host of issues, Boehner agreed in principle, saying at his weekly session with reporters, ""It's important for us as a -- as a party, especially in an election year, to tell people what you're for."" Perhaps in response to growing calls from his own members, the speaker committed that House Republicans would come forward this year with their own proposal to replace Obamacare. But he didn't guarantee a vote on it before the election. The refrain ""repeal and replace"" was a central GOP message right after the President signed the health care law in 2010. Although there have been more than 40 votes to roll back the entire law or parts of it, there has been no vote on a plan to take its place. But what do conservatives want? Even those Republicans demanding a ""bold vision"" from their leaders aren't articulating what that means. Several House conservatives admit there are splits about what should be included on the 2014 to-do list, and that divide could take a while to sort out. ""This is clearly going to be an internal struggle of the Republican party: Are we going to just be the party that says 'hey the other side is worse' or are we going to show why our side is actually better for the American people or the public?"" Labrador asked. He and other conservatives are worried that the national party has become too closely aligned with big business, and instead should be targeting its agenda and message at small businesses and individuals. In addition to the party laying out its own health care plan, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan outlined several areas he said voters want to see Congress tackle this year. He held up tax reform that helps promote new jobs as a must-do priority, something Republicans put on their agenda for every new congressional session. New spot in ad wars over Obamacare . Perhaps as a response to the Democrats' laser focus this year on income inequality issues, Jordan said the GOP should focus on policies aimed at lower-income Americans, suggesting welfare reform should be revisited. He also said Americans want Congress to deal with the worries people have about privacy protections. ""These are four things that help every single family in this country,"" Jordan said, and insisted leaders should schedule votes on bills covering all those conservative priorities. One issue that is guaranteed to set up a clash between conservatives and Boehner is immigration reform. The speaker is expected to release a set of principles on immigration reform later this month. He has said repeatedly it's important for Congress to fix the broken system, including addressing what to do about the 11 million undocumented workers in the United States. Boehner and other top House GOP leaders are adamant they won't take up anything resembling the comprehensive legislation the Senate passed last year. But even moving the piecemeal bills Boehner has said he supports will be politically messy, because a majority of his own members are reluctant to sign off on any measure that grants eventual citizenship. GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a longtime opponent of any measure granting legal status to undocumented workers in the United States, doesn't think an immigration debate does anything but help Democrats. ""Every day that we discuss immigration, that helps Barack Obama change the topic from Obamacare."" The first fight is the debt ceiling. Election year makes Washington even more confusing . A big test for Boehner's ability to assuage conservatives comes soon: House Republicans need to decide how they will approach the debate over the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the nation's borrowing authority will run out at the end of February. Last fall's government shutdown was a public display of the fight between conservatives who demanded any spending bill defund Obamacare and establishment Republicans who worried it was a no-win situation. But that episode did have a silver lining for Boehner, who warned the standoff over Obamacare would backfire. It served as a teachable moment for conservatives about the limits of what they can demand in a divided government. Scalise said he wants to address the long-term debt as part of the debt debate, but he's not sure yet what Republicans should negotiate in return for supporting another increase in the debt ceiling. But he didn't seem to think that debate was the best place to take another stand on Obamacare. ""It has to be something achievable and we ought to start with that. It ought to be something we can rally the country around and ultimately sign into law that addresses the problem,"" Scalise said. How Boehner handles the delicate relationship with conservatives will be key to the prospects for his 2014 legislative agenda. But the speaker is also the top GOP leader in Washington of a party still struggling to regroup after losses at the national level in 2012, so the direction he takes will also have an impact on the political message in this fall's midterm elections.","Conservatives fear Boehner will play ""prevent defense"" ahead of midterms .

"(CNN) -- The phenomenon of women choosing not to have children is afflicting the industrialized world in alarming numbers. Childlessness is steadily becoming more widespread, particularly in English-speaking countries but also in Japan and in much of Europe. In 20 years, the number of childless women in many countries has doubled. In the lively debate that has followed the American publication of my book ""The Conflict,"" much has been said and written about the pros and cons of breastfeeding and mothers staying at home. But this larger issue receives scant attention. In the United States, where fertility rates remain high, 20% of women are childless, which is twice as many as 30 years ago. There are an estimated 18% in England, 20% in Italy, and between 21% and 26% in Germany. We do not have figures for childless Japanese women, but we do know that Japan has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, along with Germany, where it hovers at 1.3 children. Although a minority of women choose not to have children, the trend constitutes a genuine revolution, pointing to some unspoken resistance to motherhood. As we know, as soon as women were able to control reproduction, pursue studies, enter the job market and aspire to financial independence, motherhood stopped being an inevitable, self-evident step and became a choice instead. Whether we like it or not, motherhood is now only one important aspect of women's identity, no longer the key to achieving a sense of self-fulfillment. And the rate at which women are saying no to children -- most notably among those with college education -- suggests that the choice, for many, threatens the other facets of their identity: their freedom, energy, income and professional accomplishments. No country can afford to ignore a decline in its birthrate. In the long term, a nation's pension payments, power and very survival are at stake. To curb the drop in recent decades, some European governments have re-evaluated their family policies. Germany's example is especially instructive: Although the state's family policies are now among the most generous in Europe -- a parent who stays home with a child receives 67% of his or her current net income for up to 12 months -- they have failed to boost the birthrate or reverse the figures for childless women. Germany's policies provide considerable financial help, but they essentially encourage mothers (recent figures show that only 15% of fathers take advantage of the leave) to quit the work force. Only an astonishing 14% of German mothers with one child in fact resume full-time work. Thus the family policies end up promoting the role of the father-provider, while mothers in effect feel the need to choose between family and work from the moment the first child is born, an especially risky proposition when one in three marriages ends in divorce. In this situation, where a high number of mothers are able to stay at home but the birthrate remains exceptionally low, the message is clear: Women do not want policies that serve only to support mothers in their family life. For women to want children, they require policies that support the full range of their needs and roles and ambitions -- maternal, financial, professional. The varying European experiences show that the highest birthrates exist in the countries with the highest rates of working women. It is, therefore, in society's interest to support working motherhood, which requires considerable public investment. Generous leave is not, by itself, an incentive. To raise more than one child, a mother must have access to high-quality, full-day child care, but that is still not enough. Income equality, flexible work hours and partners sharing family-related tasks -- these are the essential components that will allow women to be mothers without forgoing their other aspirations. Tellingly, these are the rallying causes of traditional feminism, more pressing and relevant than ever. It turns out that profound feminist reform, in the workplace and in family policies, might just be what is needed to keep the birthrate from free fall. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elisabeth Badinter.","Elisabeth Badinter: In 20 years, number of childless women has doubled in many countries .

"(CNN) -- Not long ago I received a complaint from a co-worker that I had used the f-word in a tweet. I was quoting a lyric from the band Vampire Weekend: ""Who gives a f--- about an Oxford comma?"" My answer was, of course, ""I do."" The full quote, without the fig leaf, appears in my book ""The Glamour of Grammar."" I come by my f-wordiness honestly. My grandmother used it easily and could swear in three languages. My mother -- at the age of 94 -- drops an f-bomb in every telephone conversation. During a trivia game at her assisted living home, she could not think of the name of Peter, Paul, and Mary's magic dragon, so she blurted: ""F--- the Magic Dragon,"" which now has become the family's official title for the song. The f-word is almost everywhere. While still not fit for polite society, it no longer carries the depth of taboo attributed to it in 1978 by that hero of foul mouthery George Carlin, who said in a comic monologue: ""The big one, the word f---, that's the one that hangs them up the most."" Its common usage in popular culture today may have transformed it into one of the most versatile words in American English. It might qualify as the word of the new century. But is that a good thing? Setting records on screen . The recent opening of the Martin Scorsese film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" has inspired critical and popular complaints about its excesses, including its language. I have not yet seen the film, but am grateful to the dirty word counters, who have recorded a total of 506 uses of the f-word in the three-hour movie. Wikipedia, Variety, Time and various other sources cite this as a record for a non-documentary film, beating Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" (435), and two earlier Scorsese projects: ""Casino"" (422) and ""Goodfellas"" (300). Versions of the f-word appear so often in ""Wolf"" that an accurate count might be impossible. Slate's total comes in at 544. (I hope I don't see a Politifact report contesting these numbers.) (""Summer of Sam"" appears to keep the record for most fpm: f-words per minute, at 3.1. ""Wolf"" does beat ""Casino"" on this metric. In his mischievous book of lists, Karl Shaw calculates that a viewer of ""Casino"" will hear the f-word on the average of 2.4 times per minute. For ""Wolf"" it's 2.8 times.) How things have changed. I remember with surprising clarity the first time I used the f-word. One of the Masterson brothers told me a joke, and he thought it was so funny I ran home to tell my mother. She didn't laugh and made me repeat it to my father. It was 1956 or so. I was, maybe, 8 years old. Things did not go well. I went to work with my dad one day, a United States Customs officer on one of the New York piers. A group of men stood inside, including some rough-looking longshoremen, who dropped the f-word loudly and often into their gritty conversation. Several men, alerting them to my presence, told them to stick a cork in it. Even in their gruffness, they looked sheepish and apologetic. First encounters . I remember exactly where I was standing the first time I heard a girl my age use the f-word. It was 1967 and I was a sophomore in college. She sat on the ground, a hippie chick, smoking and grousing about her inability to score tickets for the Newport Folk Festival. And I know exactly where I first encountered the f-word in print. I was a freshman in high school, and the book was called ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" a work on many lists of the most often banned books. J.D. Salinger uses the word five times in ""Catcher"" with great power and specificity. I still own the book where I underlined each use of the word. I remember the teachers who tried to convince me that the main problem with the f-word was not its power to offend, but the evidence it gave of your limited vocabulary. I blew that criticism off back then, but I'm beginning to think they were on to something. Not that the f-word isn't an amazingly versatile piece of our four-letter Anglo-Saxon heritage. Think about it. It can express surprise, outrage, anger, humor, delight or desire. And it can stand in for several parts of speech: noun, verb (in any tense), gerund, participle, imperative, interrogative, interjection, to mention just the most common uses. It can be used with other little prepositional helpers. You can f--- with someone's mind. You can be too f---ed up to walk. You can get f---ed over by the IRS. A rare language form . Let's not forget use of the f-word as one of the rarest of language forms, the infix. A prefix comes before a word. A suffix comes after. An infix appears in the middle of a normal word or phrase, as in ""You are damn f---ing right."" Or ""un-f---ing-believable."" Or as they like to moan in Boston when thinking of the New York Yankees victory in the 1978 playoff game: ""Bucky F---ing Dent!"" It was the light-hitting Dent's timely home run that ruined the Red Sox season. All this and more is chronicled in the recent 270-page lexicon titled ""The F-Word,"" by Jesse Sheidlower, editor at large of the Oxford English Dictionary. Lex meets sex. Perhaps the ultimate expression of the f-word's versatility comes in a famous scene from David Simon's HBO series ""The Wire"" in which two detectives explore a crime scene. The scene takes less than four minutes, during which the cops use versions of the f-word, by my count, 34 times. It is the only word used in the scene. As they look at crime scene photos of naked and murdered women, the word expresses disgust. As they examine the conflicting evidence, the word describes frustration. As they begin to piece things together, it describes mounting excitement. When they find a key piece of evidence, it is a word of celebration. Offensive from the beginning . The f-word has a long history, and, unlike some other taboo words, seems to have been offensive from the start. Just as newspapers and this website put a veil over the word by eliminating some letters, the earliest known version of the word in English was written in code. According to the American Heritage Dictionary, an English poem dated about 1500 makes fun of clerics who don't keep their vows, including a line that translates: ""They are not in heaven because they f--- wives of Ely"" (a town near Cambridge). In the text, the f-word appears in the form of a letter substitution code. Though still considered vulgar slang, the f-word is more prevalent than ever, and is often cited as evidence of the coarsening of our culture. The publisher of ""The Naked and The Dead"" asked Norman Mailer to substitute ""fug"" in 1947. Six decades later, the f-word is a staple in hip-hop music, stand-up comedy routines, locker room harangues, pornographic repartee, and any movie or cable television series that tries to portray gritty, realistic dialogue. Cops use it, thugs use it, even grads with Ph.Ds use it. I am making the case that, given its ubiquity and versatility, the ""f-word"" is one of the most important words of the 21st century, which is why we should pay close attention to how it can be used well. In previous essays on language, I have offered these justifications for dropping the occasional f-bomb: . 1. As an authentic expression of realistic human speech. 2. As a single, shocking, almost-out-of context blow to the solar plexus. 3. As a neutralizer to the poison of piety, fastidiousness and erudition. 4. As a way of defining character. None other than Theodore Bernstein, the influential style czar of The New York Times, once published this opinion: ""There is not ... a single transitive verb in respectable or even in scientific language that expresses the idea of the slang verb f---."" Using and overusing the f-word . Perhaps the most moving use of the f-word I ever encountered came in the documentary 9/11 by two French brothers, who were telling the story of a firehouse in New York. During the filming, two jetliners flew into the Twin Towers, changing the way Americans look at the world. Even though the show ran on commercial television, we were given a chance to hear, uncensored, the rough emotional language of a fraternity of brave men facing their greatest challenge. Real life. There is a numbing quality to overuse of the f-word. Shock and stark realism can be created without it. You won't find it in the novel ""The Great Gatsby,"" or the recent film version, which, like ""Wolf,"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio. I don't remember hearing it in a Jerry Seinfeld monologue. I like it best when it is used rarely and in a perfect context, as when it comes out of the mouth of the character Walter White, the high school chemistry teacher who becomes the drug lord of ""Breaking Bad."" When he first utters it in rage and frustration at a moment of great pain, it has as much power as a gun blast. It works best when delivered at just the right dramatic moment. To keep up with the Scorsese rate, the characters in ""Breaking Bad"" would have to utter the f-word about 140 times -- in each 47-minute episode. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roy Peter Clark.","Roy Peter Clark notes that ""Wolf of Wall Street"" uses f-word hundreds of times .

Among other issues, the report said Tsarnaev's lawyers have not had a chance to review the many pieces of physical evidence, ""including nearly 2,000 items that reportedly are still being analyzed by the FBI and items kept at additional locations."" The defense is also making additional discovery requests. Prosecutors said they estimate the trial would last approximately 12 weeks. If Tsarnaev is found guilty, prosecutors expect the sentencing hearing would last approximately six weeks. Jurors will not only weigh whether he's guilty but also whether he deserves to die. Federal prosecutors said last month they'll seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev, arguing that he acted in ""an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner"" and lacks remorse. Tsarnaev is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the April 15 attack, which left three people dead and more than 250 others injured. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Authorities allege Tsarnaev, a Chechnya-born American, and his brother, Tamerlan, planted two homemade bombs near the finish line of the marathon, then killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later. The attacks triggered the massive manhunt that led to Tsarnaev's capture. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev during the manhunt.

"(CNN) -- The head of world soccer Sepp Blatter has again been caught up in controversy -- but this time it was all the fault of a fake FIFA president. Blatter's Twitter account was hacked on Monday as was FIFA's official account for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. As well saying he was stepping down as FIFA president, the bogus tweets referred to Blatter and Qatar's winning 2022 World Cup bid. ""Some FIFA accounts, including @SeppBlatter and @fifaworldcup, have been hacked,"" said FIFA in a statement. A group calling themselves the Syrian Electronic Army -- said to be supportive of the country's leader Bashar Al-Assad -- claimed responsibility for hacking the accounts. ""This sort of attack is about getting a point across,"" Sian John, security strategist at software and security firm Symantec, told CNN. ""Hacking comes back to manipulation. Some groups do it to gain money and some of them to do it to get a point across. There are different motivating factors."" Last month, the Syrian Electronic Army hacked into several of British broadcaster the BBC's accounts. Prior to the hacking of Blatter, another Twitter account emerged -- @Fifnonymous -- which threatened to disclose confidential FIFA documents, though it was quickly deleted or suspended. It is unclear whether the account was genuine or a hoax. ""At no time did an account with this name come up in any discussions with Twitter,"" a FIFA spokesman told CNN. Other high-profile victims of hacking include Burger King and Jeep, whose Twitter accounts were both hijacked in February. Twitter's own systems were hacked earlier this year, with attackers gaining access to usernames as well as encrypted and randomized passwords for about 250,000 users. ""As we are online so much more now, I'd expect to see more high-profile attacks,"" added John. ""It's not a reason to panic but a reason to take a step back and think how we should protect ourselves online. ""I spend most of my time trying to encourage companies to make information security a priority. People used to see it as an IT problem -- but now they see it as a business problem. ""The challenge for businesses now is how they manage the impact on their brand if they were to have an attack."" Blatter may have been targeted because he divides opinion, regularly attracting controversy over his leadership but also helping promote soccer across the globe. A series of corruption scandals within FIFA, his botched re-election campaign -- where his only opponent was barred from standing after another corruption scandal -- and the failure of England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup to attract any interest in FIFA's corridors of power (despite having the best technical report) led to an outpouring of criticism of Blatter. However, his dedication to grassroots football and the game's growth in Africa, the Middle East and Asia are widely regarded as positives of his presidency. When Blatter joined the federation, 146 countries were members. Now, there are 209 member nations, earning Fifa the nickname the ""United Nations of Football"". Despite the embarrassment for FIFA and Blatter, security expert John urged him to continue tweeting. Password panic . ""Open attacks are most often down to the users themselves,"" John explained. ""Strong passwords are crucial to prevent hacking. ""I ask friends five questions and if any of the answers they give me are part of their passwords then they have failed the test. ""The questions are spouse's name, significant birthdays, favorite sporting team, siblings and pet's name. Many a dog has died and lived on in a password. ""The key is not panicking. There's no need to stay off social media or the internet -- it's about thinking about the dangers. ""Secure your password, don't use social media on free public wifi, don't let people see what you're typing -- and don't say something on social media which you wouldn't be prepared to shout out at in a public space."" A Twitter spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the hacking of the Blatter and FIFA's accounts. FIFA president since 1998 , the 77-year-old Blatter has not yet announced whether he will be standing for a fifth term when his current term ends in 2015. But if he does, he may want to set a new password first.","FIFA president Sepp Blatter's Twitter account hacked .

"(CNN) -- Olympic snowboarding medalist Shaun White has been charged with vandalism and public intoxication after pulling a fire alarm and breaking a phone at a hotel in Nashville, police said. White was arrested after trying to flee the hotel in a cab and kicking a hotel guest who tried to stop him, according to a statement Monday from the Nashville Metro Police Department. The 26-year-old ""appeared to be extremely intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol,"" and his ""eyes were red and bloodshot,"" according to the police report. White ran from the hotel after an employee accused him of smashing a phone, police said. A guest followed White from the hotel and called police, the incident report said. ""Once the guest told Mr. White that he called the police, Mr. White attempted to attack the man and fell and hit his head,"" the report said. White was taken to a hospital to have his head injury checked, police said. The guest didn't press charges, but White was arrested on the other misdemeanor charges after refusing to sign a citation, police said. Shaun White: A natural board talent . The U.S. snowboarder, once nicknamed ""The Flying Tomato"" for his distinctive red hair, was released on his own recognizance Monday evening, Davidson County sheriff's spokeswoman Melinda McDowell said.

"(CNN) -- The FBI is warning law agencies that the new Barbie ""Video Girl"" doll could be used as a tool by pedophiles to make child pornography. In an alert entitled ""Barbie 'Video Girl' a Possible Child Pornography Production Method,"" the FBI said the doll has a built-in hidden camera in the chest and a small LCD screen for video display in her back. The FBI ""cyber crime alert"" doesn't cite any misuse of the doll, which has been on the market since July, but talks about the possibility. ""FBI investigation has revealed instances where an individual convicted of distributing child pornography had given a Barbie doll to a 6 year old girl,"" the alert said. The document went on to cite the findings of another investigation that found ""examples where a concealed video camera had recorded child pornography."" That camera didn't involve a doll, FBI special agent Frederick Gutt in Seattle, Washington, said Friday. ""The possibility of the combination of these two in a single device presents a concern for investigators,"" said the alert, dated November 30. ""Law enforcement is encouraged to be aware of unconventional avenues for possible production and possession of child pornography, such as the Barbie Video Girl,"" the document said. The FBI regularly distributes such alerts to help investigators improve policing. No incidents involving the new doll have been reported, according to Gutt and another FBI special agent, Steve Dupre. The doll's camera can capture 30 minutes of footage, and the video can be downloaded and streamed live to a computer, but there is no indication it can be streamed directly to the Internet, the FBI alert said. The notice is written for law agencies only, but someone at the FBI mistakenly sent it to media outlets in Seattle, said Dupre of the FBI's Sacramento, California, office, which distributed the notice. ""It was an inadvertent dissemination of the document,"" Dupre said. ""There have been no reported incidents of this doll being used as anything other than as intended."" Seattle media accounts of the FBI alert prompted some parents to express concerns about the doll. ""That plays into these people who prey upon our children's ideals. It frightens me,"" William Porres, a Tacoma, Washington, grandfather, told CNN affiliate KING. He said he will not buy the doll for his 6-year-old granddaughter. ""Oh, she would love it, but she's more important to me than a giggle on Christmas morning,"" Porres said. A Mattel Inc. spokesman could not be reached for comment, but the toymaker issued a statement to KING: . ""The FBI is not reporting that anything has happened. Steve Dupre from the FBI Sacramento field office has confirmed there have been no incidents of this doll being used as anything other than its intent. Mattel products are designed with children and their best interests in mind. Many of Mattel's employees are parents themselves and we understand the importance of child safety -- it is our number one priority,"" the statement said. FBI special agent Gutt said the alert apprised other agencies about how the new doll's videotaping capabilities could contain evidence. ""The cyber alert was meant for law enforcement only and was taken out of context,"" Gutt said. ""The intent was to aid law enforcement in evidence gathering."" The Mattel website says the $49.99 doll, for kids ages 6 and up, has been nominated for the 2011 Toy of the Year Award. ""Budding filmmakers, take note: Barbie doll now doubles as a video camera!"" the website says. ""Girls can record and play back clips with this multi-tasking doll, which has a video camera built right in. Capture everything from a doll's-eye-view, then watch it instantly or upload to your computer. There's an LCD screen on Barbie doll's back, and a camera lens hidden discreetly in her necklace.

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago this month, I stood on the U.S. Senate floor as our nation's leaders debated the first major anti-terrorism legislation after the tragic attacks of September 11. This legislation, which quickly passed Congress and became law, would allow the federal government, for the first time, to easily spy and collect data on innocent Americans. This law, the poorly named USA Patriot Act, and subsequent expansions of federal law enforcement power, would erode America's freedoms and waste precious resources. Patriotism is about defending America's moral character and celebrating what makes this country great. Unfortunately, this bad law did the exact opposite. I was an adviser to Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, the only senator who voted against that law. Fear and anxiety was abundant in the halls of Congress in those early days and weeks, and understandably so. My colleagues and I had experienced two terror attacks in one month -- first the September 11 attacks and then the anthrax mailings that forced many Senate employees, including myself, to take potent medication for weeks and closed an entire Senate office building for three months while it was fumigated. Washington would be on edge for months to come. I know what it feels like to be worried about safety. But I also know that we lose when our nation changes its fundamental character, when neighbors no longer trust neighbors and when government wastes precious resources. That is why I want my government targeting actual threats, not innocent Americans. During the last decade, Muslim Advocates has found the FBI has increasingly focused its powers on law-abiding citizens, not based on criminal behavior, but based on race, ethnicity and religious or political beliefs. Our report, Losing Liberty: The State of Freedom Ten Years After the Patriot Act"" found, and the ACLU has also reported, that the FBI targeted entire communities, specifically Muslims, Arabs, South Asians and Middle Easterners, sowing fear and mistrust among all Americans. So where are we 10 years later? Today, the FBI can show up at your work, unannounced, to interrogate you about an article on political events you post on Facebook, or seize information about your phone calls, e-mails, internet activity and medical and banking records -- all without a shred of evidence that you've engaged in criminal activity. Government agents can stop and interrogate you at the border as you seek to re-enter the United States, asking questions like ""Do you pray?"" ""What mosque do you attend?"" or ""Why did you convert?"" Donating $100 to a charity to help the needy can lead to questions simply because it is a Muslim-run charity. Today, it is difficult to find an American Muslim who has not had one of these encounters with law enforcement, or knows someone who has. But it's not just the Muslim community.  Journalists, professors, and anti-war activists have been targeted for surveillance, questioning and sometimes investigations by law enforcement based on their speech or political beliefs and activities. Little is publicly known about the full scope of the FBI's activities. Much of it is shrouded in secrecy. But we do know that, according to one former senior FBI counterterrorism official, the FBI conducted nearly 500,000 interviews of Muslim and Arab males from 2001-2005, and not a single one of those interviews led to information that would have allowed the government to detect or prevent the 9/11 attacks. Think about that: For every hour an agent spent talking to someone who had nothing to do with terrorism, that was one hour less spent tracking down a real threat, in this case at least 500,000 hours in four years alone not spent on actual criminals. We also know that the FBI has trained its agents that growing a beard, frequently attending a mosque or wearing traditional Muslim attire reveal extremism. This ignores that the 19 hijackers never grew beards or wore traditional Muslim attire while in the United States and that certain individuals, such as Faisal Shahzad and Colleen LaRose, never frequented a mosque. The FBI should be focused on evidence of criminal activity, not targeting law-abiding Americans. This is not the America our founders envisioned, and certainly not the beacon of liberty our nation aspires to be. America is at its best when we overcome fear and face our challenges together as one people, one nation. On this 10-year anniversary of the Patriot Act, it is time for Congress to act with courage. Congress should amend the law to require law enforcement to focus on actual threats, and should conduct a full public accounting of the use of the Patriot Act and all federal surveillance powers that target Americans based on their race, faith or political ideology. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Farhana Khera.","Farhana Khera: Patriot Act allows federal government to spy on innocent Americans .

"(CNN) -- Let's get down to business on the five highlights of Saturday's Sochi Olympics -- with coast-to-coast agreement on the best story of the day: Hockey. 1. Rivalry alive and well . It was a thriller that came down to a shootout, and we have a new hero of the day. The United States and Russia faced off Saturday, and though it was just a preliminary-round game, both teams played as if gold were on the line. The Americans won a thrilling overtime 3-2 victory that inevitably evoked memories of another dramatic win when the United States upset the former Soviet Union in a semifinal game at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics. Saturday's game ended in a tie at 2. In overtime, American T.J. Oshie scored four times on six attempts in one-on-one confrontations with Russian goalie Sergei Bobrovsky. The exceptional performance by Oshie sealed the U.S. win, though much more hockey remains to be played before medalists are determined. Russia is still in contention for the podium. Oshie, 27, a native of Everett, Washington, plays forward for the National Hockey League's St. Louis Blues. Bobrovsky, 25, a native of Novokuznetsk, also plays in the NHL, for the Columbus Blue Jackets. ""My hands are a little tingling, my feet are tingling,"" Oshie said after the game. ""It was pretty nerve-racking out there. We knew it would take 65 minutes and then some."" Said Bobrovsky: ""Obviously I'm very disappointed. It was a shootout; we wanted more. It is heartbreaking."" Don't be surprised if you hear of a controversy in this game: The Russians scored what appeared to be a game-winning goal in the third period, but it was disallowed because the net had moved from where it was supposed to be. 2. Men's skeleton . As of late Saturday, the only American to win a medal was Matthew Antoine, who took bronze in the men's skeleton, which is headfirst individual sledding at speeds up to 90 mph, with your face just inches above the ice. Antoine, 28, a native of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, was 2.97 seconds behind gold medalist Alexander Tretiakov of Russia. Winning silver was Latvia's Martins Dukurs, who was 0.81 seconds behind first place. Dukurs' brother, Tomass, finished fourth. Antoine's achievement came despite how he was told years ago that he couldn't make the U.S. team because he lacked talent. 3. Speed skating . American favorite Shani Davis was unable to make his way to the podium in men's long-track, or 1,500-meter, speed skating. He won silver medals in both the 2010 Vancouver and 2006 Turin games. Instead, the day went to Polish skater Zbigniew Brodka who won the gold, but it was by among the slimmest of margins: 0.003 seconds, to be precise. The skater missing gold -- and winning silver -- was The Netherlands' Koen Verweij. Canada's Denny Morrison took bronze. Davis finished 11th. 4. Super giant slalom . In women's Super-G skiing, America's favorite for a medal, Julia Mancuso, was shut out, too. She had won gold in the Super-G in the 2006 Turin Games (as well as two silvers in the 2010 Vancouver Games in the super combined and downhill contests). It was the Austrians, however, who took two of three medals, with a German skier taking the other. The Sochi course was rigorous, causing 18 of 49 skiers to crash or miss a turn, especially early in the competition. Winning gold was Austrian Anna Fenninger, making it her first Olympic medal. Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch took silver, and Austria's Nicole Hosp won bronze. Mancuso finished eighth. 5. Short-track speed skating . Who doesn't like short-track speed skating that American Apolo Ohno made fun and breathtaking to watch? Ohno is retired, and his mantle is being passed to J.R. Celski, a native of Monterey, California. But in Saturday's 1,000-meter men's short-track, the Russians nearly swept: Victor An took gold and Vladimir Grigorev took silver. Winning bronze was Dutchman Sjinkie Knegt. An's gold medal was Russia's first ever in short-track. The medal was An's second of the games: He earlier won bronze in the 1,500-meter short-track. An, 28, a native of Seoul, South Korea, earlier went by the name Ahn Hyun-Soo and represented South Korea in the 2006 Turin Games when he won individual gold in the 1,000-meters and 1,500-meter short-track events. It hasn't been easy for An: He missed the 2010 Vancouver Games because he crashed into a wall during training in 2008 and suffered a near career-ending knee injury that required four surgeries over 15 months. He changed his allegiance to Russia after he couldn't qualify for the Vancouver Games and now has Russian citizenship. Celski had a final ranking of 13th, behind two other Americans, Chris Creveling at 10th and Eduardo Alvarez at 11th.","Americans beat the Russians in a shootout in early-round hockey game .

"(CNN) -- Controversy in figure skating? What took so long? And Canada and the United States play to a familiar result on the hockey rink, while a Canadian faced long odds in the ski cross final four. Cue the conspiracists . Figure skating, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder. And to some the decision of the judges at Thursday's women's free program was downright ugly. As was the subsequent reaction on social media. It didn't help that one of the judges had in the past been suspended for a year for trying to fix an event at the Winter Olympics 16 years ago (apparently they don't have a Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis in figure skating). Or that another is married to the head of the Russian figure skating federation, which is cheering for the first Russian woman to win a gold medal in individual competition after she was awarded the highest score of her life. It was too much for defending Olympic champion Yuna Kim to overcome. Not everyone thinks the judging was crooked. Even though gold medalist Adelina Sotnikova had one notable mistake, she did have the more technical program. And that's where she won; her technical score was 75.54; Kim's was 69.69. Chris Chase of USA Today wrote: ""It's debatable, but not a robbery. Sotnikova skated well enough to win gold. She had a carefully constructed program with seven triples, five of which were in a combo. Kim had six and three, respectively. Thus, Sotnikova was going in with a higher total and made more margin for error, which she took advantage of with a minor hop after one exchange."" Sotnikova said she knew she had skated well. ""When I had performed all the elements I knew I would be on the podium but not which medal. When I saw I had won on the technical elements I didn't believe my eyes,"" she said. There might be more of an argument that Sotnikova's short program score of 74.64 was a real gift. We'd like more of that . Here's an idea for the women's hockey tournament. Just make it Canada vs. the United States in a best four out of seven games format. Especially if the games will be as well-played and exciting and heart-pounding and heartbreaking and magnificent and frustrating and enthralling and agonizing and stirring and mind-blowing as the one played Thursday. Depending on whose side you were on, you'll always remember this one as either a great display of Canadian spirit or the one the United States let get away. And really, the 3-2 Canada victory in overtime was both. Canada didn't score for the first 56:34 of the gold medal game then found net three times in 11-plus minutes. Of the women's four Olympic gold medals in the sport, this is the one that will be most cherished.","Canada comeback caps another gold medal run in women's ice hockey .

"(CNN) -- RICHARD QUEST SAYS: As I headed down the mountainside after the World Economic Forum, it became clear: The theme, ""Reshaping the World,"" should be attached to the event itself. I have already tweeted my personal conclusion to the forum: A missed opportunity to start a dialogue on real change. It had an overloaded agenda and too many corporate executives with no idea what they were supposed to be doing besides seeing clients and drumming up business. I don't mean there should be fewer participants. WEF constantly reminds me the number is steady, at around 2,500. But there are now so many advisers, spokesmen and assistants who attend, that 2,500 is multiplied many times. Access is more difficult, honesty becomes harder. To quote the musical Mary Poppins, it's ""a ghastly mess."" It'll always need the Big Star. This year's was Iran President Hassan Rouhani who said nothing new, but in a very engaging way. There is nothing wrong with a Las Vegas-style headliner to draw 'em in. It's the other ""stuff"" that gets in the way. Keep it Simple. The symptoms are everywhere. Walking along the Promenade, I was horrified with the numbers of Audis, BMWs, and Mercedes causing a massive traffic jam. Limos are fine for prime ministers or presidents who need the security, but there's no need for CEOs or executive to have one as a status symbol. The WEF provides an excellent shuttle service. If Iceland's president Olafur Ragnar Grimsson and his wife can walk, chatting with all on the way, CEOs can too. Getting away from the corporate bubble and sycophancy is the joy of Davos. WEF should restrict the number of passes for limos in the parking lots. They need to Keep it Simple. Onto the theme itself. If any Quest Means Business writers delivered such verbose language I would send back the script. This year's theme had merit, if anyone could get through work their way through the Davosian language. Keep it Simple! Finally, the panels. There are too many and the format is tired. The subjects, like the theme, are often esoteric and obscure. The New Healthcare Context, Rewiring the Brain, Big History for Big Picture Thinking. These may raise interesting points, but they are just a laundry list of jargon. The Davos panel is a tired way of engaging in debate. Surely it is not beyond the wit of WEF to change. Oh, and, Keep it Simple. I realise it is de rigueur to criticize Davos. Those of us who have attended for years will nostalgically claim ""it's not as good as it used to be."" That's not what I am saying. The event serves a very real purpose, allowing people to think, discuss, ponder and connect. But only if it strips back the hoopla and hullaballoo and gets back to basics -- reshaping itself to accommodate new ways of doing business, not just exhorting us to do it in the real world. Does this mean that my colleague Nina dos Santos won the debate we had over whether Davos can help solve inequality? Absolutely not. Davos is still exactly the right place to raise such issues; it's where the decision makers come to hear the arguments and ponder the possibilities. So, Davos, I will be back next year (if you invite me) but I suggest before you start urging us to reshape the world you look into your own soul and do a bit of reshaping yourself. NINA DOS SANTOS SAYS: In making a big push to talk about inequality, the World Economic Forum drew cries of derision from those present and absent from the Davos meetings this year. ""How can a bunch of billionaires truly understand the difference between privilege and poverty?"" asked commentators including myself. Besides, doesn't discussing the wealth gap among world elites smack of hypocrisy? And what impetus would they really have to enact change, especially if the status quo should suit them just fine? Yet in tackling the thorny issue -- if arguably years too late -- 2014's event did a good job of breaking down today's disparities and examining them from a variety of angles. Because we should remember that inequality comes in many guises: From health to access to education, water and food. And then there is there's the glass ceiling, which reared its ugly head in this year's WEF demographics as it emerged only 15% of participants were women today versus 17% in 2011. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg bemoaned the persistence of discrimination in the workplace, alongside Christine Lagarde, the first female managing director of the International Monetary Fund. While Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the New America Foundation, was keen to remind me it's not just the number of women in positions of power that count, it's their ability to have the confidence to speak up that also matters. Another prominent female delegate was Gillian Tett, who moderated a panel on ""The Shifting Middle"" and explained how inequality had now broken free of its traditional emerging markets homeland and emerged as a new plague of the developed economies. The good news is that the collective conscience is finally starting to turn. But as usual, when it comes to concrete measures to fight what the WEF identifies as one of the world's biggest risks, the fur-swaddled Davos crowd is as flaky as the snow blanketing its plush pistes. JOHN DEFTERIOS SAYS: After nearly a quarter century of covering Davos, there is a simple formula I use to measure the top story here -- look at the ""wow factor"" when a leader passes through the main conference center floor. Davos 2014 belonged to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Rouhani marched down the staircase with an entourage of about 30 ministers, diplomats and security personnel. Then the ""Davos Moment"" kicked in. Chief executives, policy makers and young global leaders stopped their conversations and peered over to the leader clad in his white turban and black cloak. Silence overcame the floor as the pack passed by. The Iranian president spoke before the Davos crowd about a new foreign policy of moderation, but there are plenty who harbor reservations about the country's interim nuclear development agreement that eased sanctions for six months. U.S. Senator John McCain told me that Rouhani's comments about not giving up a single centrifuge could build momentum for another sanctions bill in Congress. ""If there are more comments like that and declarations on the part of the Iranians then I think you will see some impetus behind those sanctions which would override the objections of the President, (Obama)"" he said in our interview. So this Davos benefited from being at the start of the six month agreement where policy makers and businessmen could sit face-to-face with the relatively new Iranian leadership. On the sidelines here, Rouhani reportedly held two separate meetings, one with chief executives of energy companies, the other with a wider array of business leaders from the consumer sector. The Iranian president already identified seven U.S. and European energy companies he would like to invite back. Iran is a big energy prize, with 157 billion barrels of proven reserves and the largest single gas field in the world. It's a market of 76 million consumers, so plenty of opportunity IF a final agreement can be reached. Skeptics abound and this is the beginning of a long and pot-holed filled diplomatic road which includes the influence Iran exercises over Syria. But Davos 2014 will be remembered where the six-month trial period began in earnest. READ MORE: . Richard Quest's selfie challenge . Goldie Hawn on Justin Bieber's 'heartbreaking' troubles .

"New York (CNN) -- Charges are likely to be reduced against the bikers who were arrested and charged in connection with the beating of an SUV driver on a Manhattan street in September, a Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman told CNN. Prosecutors said Friday that charges would likely be reduced on the next court date because of the lack of serious physical injury, the spokeswoman said. The reduced felony holds a penalty of five to 15 years -- the original charge holds a penalty of eight to 25 years, the spokeswoman said. Footage of the incident recorded from another biker's helmet camera went viral after it was posted online. Authorities say SUV driver Alexander Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally. When his Range Rover was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one. Lien's wife and 2-year-old daughter were in the vehicle with him. The chase that followed ended in traffic. Police say Lien's windows were smashed, he was dragged out of the SUV and beaten. He was treated and released from a hospital. He has not been charged. Eleven people were indicted in the attack. The next court appearances are scheduled for February 27 and 28.

"(CNN) -- Can anyone stop Bayern Munich? That's the question following the German side's 2-0 victory over Arsenal Wednesday in the last-16 of the Champions League. Already 16 points clear in the German Bundesliga and unbeaten in 21 league games, Bayern is looking like the team to beat once again. Bayern, which is hoping to become the first team to successfully defend the title since the competition was revamped in 1992, claimed a hard-fought win thanks to Toni Kroos' second half strike and Thomas Muller's header. It could and indeed should have been different but Arsenal wasted a glorious opportunity in the early stages when Mesut Ozil missed from the penalty spot. The home side's misery was compounded eight minutes before the break when goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off after bringing down Arjen Robben in the penalty area. David Alaba stood up to take the spot kick but could only strike his effort against the post. Bayern, which won 3-1 at Emirates Stadium at the same stage last season, began to lay siege to the Arsenal goal. And with nine minutes of the second half having elapsed, Kross unleashed a sumptuous strike which flew past substitute goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. The visitors refused to let up in their pressure and Robben had an effort well saved when his shot appeared destined for the far corner. Pep Guardiola's side did finally secure the second goal it so badly craved when substitute Muller headed home Philipp Lahm's cross with three minutes of normal time remaining. There was still time for Kroos, who scored in the game between the clubs last season, to hit the post with a measured drive. Arsenal will now head to Munich on March 11 with hopes of pulling off a repeat of their 2-0 victory last season. The same result would give Arsene Wenger's men the opportunity to take the tie into extra-time but it faces an uphill struggle against a rampant Bayern. ""We started really well and deserved one goal,"" Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker told Sky Sports. ""We dropped and dropped after the red card. We kept our defensive spirit. ""We lost here 3-1 last year against Bayern Munich and went there and beat them and we are looking forward to Munich. Why can't we get back in it? ""I think there is no doubt there was contact (for the penalty). I don't know if it was a red card because the ball was a long way from Wojciech Szczesny."" Bayern coach Pep Guardiola was pleased with his side's performance but says there is still work to do. ""Arsenal were much much much better than us for the first 20 minutes. After the red card for their goalkeeper it was another game,"" he told Sky Sports. ""When he is the last man then the referee says penalty and red card. ""It is difficult to play when you see nine players in the box. It is not easy, never. But importantly we controlled this situation and played with patience and at the end found the goal. ""Last year Bayern had a better result than this evening. It depends on our heads (the second leg)."" In the night's other game, Diego Costa's 83rd minute strike gave Atletico Madrid a priceless 1-0 win at AC Milan. Milan, the seven time champion, enjoyed the better of the chances with Kaka's effort tipped onto the crossbar by Atletico goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian goalkeeper also produced a fine save to turn Andrea Pirlo's header onto the post as the home side threatened an opener. But Milan was made to pay for its wasteful nature when Costa stole in at the far post to score a crucial away goal. ""It was a very difficult match against a great rival but we knew how to soak up the pressure and at the key moment we went after the win,"" Costa told Spain's Canal Plus. ""We have a solid advantage and now it's about going back to the Calderon and maintaining it. ""It's not over yet but we know it's a good result tonight. ""We have confidence in ourselves. Some people have been doubting us recently but we have no doubts. We are a team and we are very strong.""","Bayern Munich defeats 10-man Arsenal 2-0 in London .

"(CNN) -- Do you ever wish you could snap your fingers and change your world? As a child, I certainly did. Because like many kids, I was an outsider. And like many kids of the 1970s, I pretended to be Endora from ""Bewitched."" OK, friends have advised me that this may not have been the first choice of most 8-year-old boys, since it's slightly disturbing and maybe a little pathetic. But come on, can you blame me? I was a budding homo who was musical, gawky and deaf in one ear. Do the math. And the character of Endora represented power. Fearlessness. A take-no-prisoners attitude. So with the help of a bedspread (which approximated the caftans Endora wore and became my magical cape -- hey, when you're 8, you gotta improvise), I would close my eyes, wave my arms and cast spells to try to change my world. It was a world fraught with an obsessive compulsive clean freak mother, limbed and limbless bullies, and a series of unfortunate life events that would challenge even the most formidable witch. Of course, I'm an adult now. And I no longer don that tattered bedspread, mostly because it's not nearly as cute at this age. But like most of us, I still long for that mystical connection, that idea that I have some measure of jurisdiction over my own universe. Because let's face it, things can get really twisted these days. So how do we invoke magic as adults? I have a few ideas I'd like to share that have worked for me. None, you may be relieved to know, involves a beehive hairdo or making potions. They're just simple activities that, at least for my money, help bring me a little bit closer to the mystical element of life. First, I try to meditate. I emphasize try because for me, being forced to sit still is a form of brutality that should be covered under the Geneva convention. As someone juggling two jobs, as an exec for a TV network and as a writer (substitute your jobs here -- career woman and mother, rodeo clown and underwear model, etc.), I often have a hard time slowing down for a stoplight without checking my e-mail. But when I do meditate, magical things happen. New ideas. Emotional breakthroughs. Song lyrics for new gangsta rap tunes. Which really makes shutting up worthwhile. Second, I have a dream board. Stop laughing. I think those ugly cork boards (where you tack up pictures of the things you want) actually work. Because they're a great reinforcement. I had a mock-cover of my first book up on mine before I even got an agent. And the publication process could not have been easier. I'm just sayin'. Of course, my dream board is a rugged steel panel with magnets, which just screams manly. And it's in my bathroom, which probably seems kinda weird, but it's the one spot in the house I know I'll be in every day with my eyes open. And talk about a captive audience. Third, I try to speak in positives. About 15 years ago, I was $53,000 in debt from some business decisions apparently made while I was either drunk or insane. I constantly reinforced my poverty with my friends as if being broke was a badge of honor, like military service or watching Ken Burns documentaries. It wasn't until I began talking about how I was gonna get myself out of debt that it actually happened. I talked positively about my situation to anyone who would listen. And within months, I met a wonderful woman at a party who changed the direction of my career, and in one year's time (albeit a year I had to work like a rower on a slave ship), I was debt-free. How's that for magic? Fourth, I listen to that little voice in my head -- what is usually referred to as ""women's intuition."" With no disrespect to my female readers, stop hogging the glory! Everybody has intuition, most people just don't listen. I like to think of it as God whispering in my ear, although, because I only have one ear that works, I hope he whispers in the right one. Of course, sometimes he can scream like a hog caller and we don't pay any attention. Example: Someone got me involved, a few years back, with a scam artist. I had a very bad feeling about him from the minute I met him. But I ignored it. And let me tell you, it cost me plenty. Finally, I try to accept what is. This is not very entertaining and can, in fact, be a bummerpalooza. And, I must admit, I don't always do it without attempting to take someone down with me. After all, spreading the pain around seems like the democratic thing to do. But there really is a kind of peace in surrender, in simply saying, ""What will be, will be, because I'm too freaking exhausted to try to control it."" In the aftermath of this group of us being scammed, for example, there was a lot of screaming (mine) and tears (also mine). I was constantly imagining this guy's death in a highly entertaining car crash. I twisted myself into knots over it -- until I realized that the only person my anger was hurting was me. So I handed it over to a law firm and stepped away. And in doing so, I stopped getting sick. And I stopped yelling at random people on the street, which made for much more pleasant interactions with cops and homeless folk. Do these tips actually work? I think they have for me. But really, does it matter? Science has shown that positive thinking speeds healing. And that meditation can improve your health. Even if activities like these are only palliative, how much can it hurt? After all, we live in a world where every day is filled with both tragedies and triumphs. So maybe, with a little magical thinking, we can tip the scale a tiny bit toward the triumphs. No bedspread required.","A lonely gay kid used to pretend to be the witch Endora from  TV show ""Bewitched""

"London (CNN) -- Many Britons had awoken with a jolt that morning in April 1982 as news of the invasion on their digital clock radios left them struggling to believe their ears, oblivious even to the breezy new duet by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder that followed. But the panic had faded by the time they had boiled their kettles for tea and poured the milk onto their cornflakes with the realization that the little-known Falkland Islands were not, as most had assumed, just off the coast of Scotland. And, with the discovery that the islands were thousands of kilometers away on the other side of the world, and home to more penguins than people, most simply shrugged. Any thought of defending the islands was, of course, ridiculous. It had hardly been Britain's finest hour to have been shown up as the decrepit ruritanian relic it had become by Argentina's brutal military junta. But the sun had been setting on the empire for decades and a guano-stained archipelago hardly seemed to offer good value for money for already overstretched British taxpayers. Indeed the continuing existence of such imperial anachronisms was something of an embarrassment to the center-right Conservative government of the day, led by the supine Michael Heseltine, as it sought to forge closer ties with European neighbors still wary of the UK's jingoistic past. Within days the QE2 ocean liner had been dispatched to the South Atlantic to collect those islanders who wanted to return home to the land of their distant forebears. A lightly populated island in the outer Hebrides was identified and the islanders handsomely compensated for the inconvenience of having had their spare rooms and sandwich toasters occupied by polite but nervous teenage Argentine conscripts. Most felt that justice had eventually been done when England, fueled by the desire to extract some revenge for the humiliation of 1982, beat Argentina on their way to winning the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, albeit with the help of a large slice of luck when Steve Hodge, now remembered as the greatest player of his generation, blatantly handled the ball for his first goal. Perhaps buoyed by the ease with which the Falklands issue had been resolved (The Sun newspaper had hailed it as the greatest British retreat since Dunkirk), Heseltine had embarked on a game show-style giveaway of the last remaining blobs of pink on the world map. A memorable sketch by the ""Spitting Image"" satirical TV show portrayed him as Leslie Crowther, host of the popular British version of ""The Price is Right,"" announcing ""China! Come on down! Spain! Come on Down!"" as Hong Kong and Gibraltar were hurriedly handed over to their new masters like the keys to a new speedboat. But it was the next government that would lay the foundations for the prosperous and cohesive Britain we live in today. The 1984 election had thrown Denis Healey's Labour Party into coalition with the centrist Social Democratic Party-Liberal Alliance, a configuration that seemed to reflect the harmonious spirit of the era. Sensing a defining shift in public mood, Healey announced that the UK would decommission its Polaris nuclear deterrent and abandon plans to replace it. He also pulled British troops home from bases all over the world, slashing military expenditure. The consequences could not have been more far reaching. France followed suit, decommissioning its own nuclear weapons and hailing a new spirit of entente cordiale by announcing ambitious plans to link Paris to London via a rail tunnel under the English Channel. With Britain declaring itself nuclear weapon-free, the United States moved its stockpile of warheads to West Germany. But this provoked mass protests in West Berlin, Bonn, Frankfurt and Hamburg, as well as in East Berlin and the East German cities of Dresden, Leipzig and Karl-Marx-Stadt, as those on both sides of the Iron Curtain rejected the stranglehold that the two superpowers had exerted on Europe. By 1990 both Washington and Moscow had withdrawn their forces from the continent and the Cold War was over. In the UK, meanwhile, in addition to massive savings on the slimmed down military, the government had also found its coffers swollen by the proceeds of the North Sea oil boom. Much of the money was diverted to northern England, regenerating a region that had been long dependent on old fashioned manufacturing industries as a hub for new technologies and computing in a process known as the Big Bang. There were complaints from London of a growing north-south divide as tax breaks and deregulation attracted the smartest talent from the nascent computing scene in California and elsewhere, with Sheffield swapping steel for microchips and the Don Valley dubbed ""Silicon Valley."" But nowadays Amstrad dominates the market not just in home computers and laptops but in mobile phones, while Clive Sinclair's latest tablet had geeks queueing outside Spectrum stores in London, New York and Tokyo. The rest of the money was placed in a sovereign wealth fund that has ever since lavished the British people with the most generous welfare system on the planet and made the National Health Service a beacon of medical research. British scientists pick up Nobel prizes so frequently these days that they are hardly deemed newsworthy, but one has stood out above all others for her contribution to the wellbeing of the planet. Margaret Thatcher had originally planned to go into politics, but she had soon found that the prospects for a female MP in the then-male dominated world of Westminster were far from enticing. Returning to her first love of chemistry, she proved to be a determined, dedicated and headstrong researcher with a natural aptitude for leadership, rising through the ranks to run her own medical laboratory. Her achievements included developing a treatment for emphysema, a breakthrough for which she was lauded by the National Union of Mineworkers. In the former colliery villages of northern England, long retired miners still raise a glass to Maggie, as she is affectionately known. But it was her groundbreaking work on cancer cells that would eventually earn Thatcher the Nobel medical prize. As she had eloquently put it as she collected the award in Oslo, urging others to continue her relentless fight against the disease, ""We always have to be aware of the enemy within."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Hooper.","Former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher died last week aged 87 .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government and business tycoon Richard Branson led a growing chorus of voices around the world Tuesday slamming Uganda's new anti-gay bill, which would make some gay acts punishable by life in prison. The bill, which in its original form prescribed the death penalty for cases of ""aggravated homosexuality"" -- for instance if someone is infected with HIV -- reduced the penalty to life imprisonment before the vote. Clauses that criminalize the ""promotion"" of homosexuality could cause activists and even doctors treating gay patients with HIV to face prison time. The United States opposes ""any legislation that undermines a person's enjoyment of his or her human rights, and for that reason we condemn legislation that criminalizes consensual sexual conduct between adults or criminalizes simply being of a particular sexual orientation or gender identity,"" a State Department official said Tuesday. Emphasizing that Washington respects Uganda's sovereignty, the official noted that some of Uganda's own government institutions have spoken out ""against further criminalization of homosexuality."" ""As Americans, we believe that people everywhere deserve to live in freedom and equality -- and that no one should face violence or discrimination for who they are and whom they love,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""We join those in Uganda and around the world who appeal for respect for the human rights of LGBT persons and of all persons."" Among those condemning Uganda's anti-gay bill was British billionaire and Virgin chief Branson, who tweeted that he ""wouldn't do business in Uganda due to their dreadful anti-gay laws."" He urged others to follow suit. In a statement on his website, under the headline ""Let people love whoever they want,"" Branson wrote that he was seriously considering doing business in Uganda, but the ""witch hunt against the gay community and lifetime sentences means it would be against my conscience to support this country."" ""Governments must realise that people should be able to love whoever they want,"" he wrote. ""It is not for any government (or anyone else) to ever make any judgments on people's sexuality. They should instead celebrate when people build loving relationships that strengthen society, no matter who they are."" Gay-rights activists have warned of mounting violence against homosexuals after Parliament passed the controversial legislation last week. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts have been punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. But lawmakers in the conservative nation sought even harsher legislation, saying the Western lifestyle risks destroying Ugandan family units. ""What we are convinced and sure of is that nobody can in one's right conscience and consciousness choose to be homosexual,"" said Simon Lokodo, Uganda's minister for ethics and integrity. ""This must be under pressure or conditions because we know that the natural tendency is always for a male to go for a female and vice versa."" For the bill to become law, President Yoweri Museveni will have to approve it within 30 days.","NEW: The United States appeals to Uganda to respect human rights .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stepped to the sidelines for a private conversation at a security conference in Germany on Sunday, according to a senior State Department official. Their discussion marks another high-level contact between the United States and Iran, a few weeks ahead of nuclear negotiations involving world powers planned for February 18 in Vienna. The negotiations follow Iran's agreement in November to stop its most sensitive nuclear operations in exchange for a lessening of some sanctions that have hurt the nation. ""Kerry reiterated the importance of both sides negotiating in good faith and Iran abiding by its commitments under the Joint Plan of Action,"" the nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran, the senior official said. Kerry ""also made clear that the United States will continue to enforce existing sanctions,"" the official said. On another topic, ""Secretary Kerry pressed for the Iranians to work cooperatively with us in our efforts to help United States citizens Robert Levinson, Amir Hekmati, and Saeed Abedini to return to their families,"" the official said. Levinson disappeared from Iran seven years ago. Members of Levinson's family said on CNN in January that, at that time, he was working for the CIA. They accused the U.S. government of failing to do enough to find and free him. Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine who served in Iraq, was arrested in Iran in August 2011 and held on espionage charges. The Obama administration has said he is not a spy. Saeed Abedini, an Iranian-American pastor, is also jailed, accused of proselytizing Christianity during a trip to Iran. He was accused of attempting to undermine the Iranian government and endangering national security. Abedini's family says he being held in a dangerous prison. Hekmati and Abedini could receive reduced sentences, Zarif said in an interview less than two weeks ago from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""We have various clemency measures in Iran that can be introduced, happened in the past, can be introduced again in these cases,"" Zarif said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto. Earlier discussions: Syria . In recent days at the Munich Security Conference, other contact between Kerry and Zarif has been focused on the conflict in Syria, which has killed more than 100,000 Syrians and forced more than 2 million from their homes. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon were also in Munich, as was U.N. mediator Lakhdar Brahimi. As talks continued, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime failed to turn over its known chemical weapons stockpiles on time, causing Kerry to warn on Friday that all options remain available to force compliance. Iran, Russia and Syria are allies. U.S. President Barack Obama threatened a military response last year when U.S. authorities determined the al-Assad regime attacked its own people with chemical weapons. However, Obama failed to secure backing from Congress or key ally Great Britain. Russia then stepped in to persuade al-Assad to hand over the chemical weapons stockpiles to the international community in order to be destroyed. On Saturday, Kerry and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met on the sidelines of the security conference and talked about continuing to press the Syrian regime to meet the deadline and move chemical weapons to the port of Latakia in Syria, a senior State Department official said. ""They agreed that more needed to be done to increase humanitarian access,"" the official said, adding that the Kerry and Davutoglu said that the delay of moving access to convoys into the besieged Syrian city of Homs and other areas was ""simply unacceptable."" Opinion: Are Syria, Iran playing Obama for a fool? CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","U.S. Secretary of State, Iranian foreign minister meet on sidelines at security conference .

"(CNN) -- It's Election Day in America. Across the country, mayors, governors and other officials will be elected. The results will be dissected for meaning. Mandates will be claimed and trends extrapolated. And we'll all pretend not to notice that somewhere between 60% and 80% of eligible voters didn't bother to cast a ballot. It's an off-year election, yes, with no compelling national contests. But even in years that we think of as high-water marks of civic participation, such as 2008, four out of 10 eligible voters stay home. In the world's self-proclaimed greatest democracy, a norm is now setting in that says, quite simply, voting is for suckers. That certainly was the message of a recent interview and essay by the comedian Russell Brand. Both went viral, especially among young people, and it's easy to see why. He's an irreverent, facile commentator. And his message, meant for a British audience but applicable here too, is that politics is now fundamentally rigged, making voting a folly and revolution a necessity. But what Brand really ends up proving, in entertaining fashion, is that being half-right can be a very dangerous thing. It's hard to dispute that politics in America has become a rigged game. Why else is Congress is in a mad rush to cut food stamps while shielding corporate subsidies? How else would more than half the $400 billion in annual federal tax breaks flow to the richest 5% of Americans? We live in an age when advantage and disadvantage are increasingly undeserved, when economic inequality and unequal political voice reinforce each other in a vicious cycle. This is what the scholars Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson described in their book ""Winner-Take-All Politics"" -- a methodical, bipartisan array of national policies to disinvest in the middle class and the poor and to reward the privileged for already being privileged. And this is what gave us both the tea party and Occupy Wall Street, movements united by little except their deep-seated anti-elite anger. It's understandable, then, why millions of younger, poorer, darker-skinned Americans -- for that's who disproportionately fills the ranks of the non-voters -- would check out of politics and voting altogether. But the stark contrast between what the tea party and Occupy each did after their first bursts of anger underscores precisely why checking out makes a bad situation worse. The tea party organized at the precinct level, fielded candidates, won elections and became if not a majority then a king-making (or at least government-shutting) minority in legislatures across the land, including the U.S. House of Representatives. The Occupy movement didn't. That helps explain why American politics still tilts more rightward on economic issues than its people do, and why a president re-elected by a wide margin a year ago is still playing defense. Critics such as Brand may be astute in their diagnosis, but they're deluded in their prescription. There is no such thing as not voting. In a democracy, not voting is voting -- for all that you detest and oppose. While abstaining from the ballot can be dressed up as an act of passive resistance, it is in fact an active delivery of power and voice to those who'd like to take advantage of you. Far from weakening an unjust system, not voting only amplifies the system's pain-inflicting power. So perhaps the most compelling appeal to today's nonvoters isn't that ""it's our patriotic duty"" (though it is) or that ""others gave their lives for this right"" (though they did). It's this: not voting is for suckers. Some frustrated nonvoters claim there's no meaningful choice anyway between the two parties. This is colossally naive. Imagine for a moment where the country would be today if all the people who formed the tea party had decided that politics was just too sordid or that their individual votes couldn't possibly make a difference. Politics may indeed be sordid, but it changes only to the extent we aggregate votes. To be sure, today's political debate is too narrow, disallowing ideas such as a guaranteed minimum income or single-payer health care. But it also, at least for now, disallows a dismantling of Social Security or repeal of civil rights laws. The question is this: Which set of disallowed ideas would you hate to see become law? And what's more likely to usher in what you fear -- voting or not voting? Brand and his fans speak vaguely of the need for a ""revolution"" to upend everyday democracy. It turns out everyday democracy already provides for revolution. In the 2012 election, youth voters, low-income voters, Latino voters and Asian voters all turned out at less than 50%. Mobilize 100% of them and our nation's political priorities become completely different and our government radically more responsive to all the people. You say you want a revolution? Vote for one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Liu.","Eric Liu: Between 60% and 80% of eligible voters won't vote in Tuesday's elections .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City captured the first trophy of the English domestic season Sunday as they recovered from a goal down to beat Sunderland 3-1 in the League Cup final at Wembley. Fabio Borini gave the underdogs a deserved early lead until second half goals from Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri and Jesus Navas settled an exciting final. Sunderland, in the relegation zone in the English Premier League, gave Manuel Pellegrini's expensively assembled team an almighty shock by not only going ahead but dominating the proceedings until City woke up after the break. ""The first half was not up to standard, but the second half was brilliant,"" was the verdict of captain Vincent Kompany as his team eye a treble in England after years of domination by neighbors Manchester United. Manchester City's last trip to Wembley had ended in bitter disappointment in last season's English FA Cup final and the sack for Roberto Mancini. When Borini latched on to a fine pass from Adam Johnson and eluded Kompany before firing the Black Cats ahead, it looked for a while that the nightmare might be repeated. Sunderland continued to look dangerous in counter attacks and might have gone further ahead, but after the break the tide changed. In the 55th minute, Pablo Zabaleta rolled the ball back to Toure and the Ivory Coast international beat Vito Mannone from long range with a glorious effort. Almost from the restart, Nasri had put City ahead for good as he swept home Aleksandar Kolarov's deflected left-wing cross. It was the cue for City to bring on Navas in place of Sergio Aguero, who was returning to the side after injury. Gus Poyet introduced Craig Gardner and Steven Fletcher, the latter missing a chance to equalize in the dying moments. The ball was quickly switched upfield and Toure found Navas who scored a clinching third. City could return to Wembley in the FA Cup, having reached the quarterfinals and have been strongly challenging for the English Premier League title. But a home defeat to Barcelona in the first leg of the last 16 has damaged their chances in the European Champions League. In the English Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur maintained their push for a Champions League spot with a 1-0 home win over Cardiff City to close up in fifth spot. Roberto Soldado broke his EPL goal drought by scoring in the first half to leave the visitors firmly rooted in the bottom three. Christian Benteke scored twice in Aston Villa's 4-1 win over struggling Norwich, while Swansea and Crystal Palace battled to a 1-1 draw.","Manchester City win English League Cup at Wembley .

"(CNN) -- A reputed New Jersey mobster whose strip club was the setting for the Bada Bing go-go bar on ""The Sopranos"" is playing out a scene from the hit HBO series by turning informant in real life, according to court papers. Under a December plea agreement, Anthony Cardinalle, 62, of Saddle River, New Jersey, will assist the U.S. Justice Department, FBI, and other law enforcement agencies to uncover organized crime throughout the New York metropolitan area, according to court documents. Cardinalle, who the feds say is an associate of the Genovese crime family, was arrested in January 2013 on racketeering and extortion charges, along with 31 other people. The accused mobsters allegedly tried to take over legitimate waste disposal businesses by threatening economic and physical harm, according to court papers. His collaboration with federal law enforcement officials would make him what Soprano ""wiseguys"" would call a ""mob rat."" Cardinalle's supposed exploits are similar to those of the fictitious ""Sopranos"" characters. ""The tactics they used to exert and maintain their control come right out of the mafia playbook,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement last year when charges were announced. Cardinalle was a member of what prosecutors called the Waste Disposal Enterprise, a criminal organization that engaged in various crimes, including extortion, loansharking, mail fraud and stolen property offenses, according to court papers. His lawyer did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Cardinalle faces up to 40 years in prison, but he may be eligible for a lighter sentence because of his guilty plea and cooperation. Law enforcement officials have agreed not to prosecute Cardinalle for criminal tax violations, according to court papers. Cardinalle's Lodi, New Jersey club, Satin Dolls, was where the infamous mob boss Tony Soprano regularly conducted shady business deals in his office in the backroom. When ""The Sopranos"" star James Gandolfini died in June, Satin Dolls honored the late actor by putting up pictures of him throughout club and a sign outside that said, ""Thank You Jimmy, Farewell Boss.""","Documents: Reputed mobster decides to become informant .

"(CNN) -- A snow-covered landscape is one of the classic images showcasing the beauty of weather on Earth. We are awed by the grandeur of white-capped mountains and the almost magical quality of snow-covered trees. We are also frustrated when the tempests of winter reach far and wide, striking as they have done this year in America's southern states. When it comes to forecasting the likelihood of a blizzard, the weather anchors know what to say. But when asked to predict how much snow will actually accumulate, they will give estimates. Why? The computer models used in weather forecasting do not actually predict snow. A single variable is used to predict water in its various forms -- liquid, vapor or ice -- so we need other information, such as air temperature, to decide whether snowfall is likely. Models forecast the amount of liquid water produced when air rises above the height at which water vapor begins to condense. This is commonly known as the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF). While QPFs are an important ingredient when it comes to predicting snow, there are many other very subtle factors that can easily tip the balance in favor of rain, or make it very difficult to distinguish between different types of snow. If temperatures are low enough to allow precipitation to fall as snow, then the forecasters need some way to convert the QPF to an equivalent snowfall. The ratio that we use to calculate the liquid water to snow equivalent is around 1 to 10. That is, if the QPF predicts 1 inch of rain, we can anticipate the amount of snow produced would be 10 inches. Unfortunately, life's not always that simple. The liquid water to snow ratio can vary depending on whether the snow is ""wet"" or ""dry."" Dry snow is the term used to describe small powdery flakes, and it forms when there is very little moisture available. Under these circumstances, the rain to snow ratio can be considerably higher, with values of 1 to 20 not uncommon. On the other hand, if there is abundant moisture and the snowflakes are larger and wetter, a ratio of 1 to 5 may be typical. Therefore we need to have a very accurate forecast of the levels of moisture in the atmosphere, together with the variation of temperature with altitude, to even get off on the right foot when it comes to predicting snowfall. Our forecast models represent a snapshot of the weather at any moment in time by using huge arrays of numbers to describe states of the atmosphere. These numbers represent basic variables such as moisture and temperature. Calculating how these many millions of ""weather pixels"" will change requires superfast computation and large amounts of memory. The inevitable limitations on available computer power and data storage force a trade-off between the geographical coverage of models and the detail that we can expect from them. This trade-off can be critical when it comes to calculating reliable QPFs. Forecasters often have to resort to methods they learned at college, involving dew points, temperature soundings from meteorological balloon ascents and real-time reports from weather stations to assess the impact of a snow storm. The bottom line is that snow -- one of our most loved, and occasionally loathed, features of weather -- is real tough to forecast well. We may be able to capture the beauty of Mother Nature with high resolution digital images, but capturing the physics behind the snowfall in our sophisticated weather prediction models is much more challenging. Making the final call comes down to ""seat of the pants"" knowledge in the end.

"(CNN) -- As thousands of aviation geeks, (oops, sorry, ""enthusiasts""), hang out at this week's giant AirVenture airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the folks at Disney brought a gift: a sneak preview Friday night of the movie ""Planes."" This is Hollywood's answer to the wildly successful animated film ""Cars."" ""Planes"" aims to celebrate the same passion for travel across skyways that ""Cars"" did for highways. Obviously, it's a safe bet many avgeeks will like it -- it's about planes! But are they gonna respect it? Although aviation enthusiasts tend to appreciate authenticity, attention to detail and accuracy, let's remind ourselves that this is a fantasy movie about planes that talk. With that in mind, when it comes to the aircraft, does the movie bear any resemblance to reality? Well, yes, according to Sean Bautista, a veteran pilot who consulted on the film. Bautista, who has flown planes ranging from small Cessnas to fighter jets to Boeing 747 airliners, spoke with CNN from his home in California's central San Joaquin Valley about his work on ""Planes,"" and he pulled back the curtain to reveal a few behind-the-scenes details. CNN: What does this film offer adult aviation enthusiasts? What can they look forward to? Sean Bautista: At a screening for aviation enthusiasts I went to, the general comments were that, in the air, it was probably the most accurate aviation movie they've seen. That includes animated and non-animated movies. But as you watch the movie after a while, I forgot they were airplanes. You get so into the story. Of course, it's not completely realistic. One thing they did with the movie that's really unique: On the ground, the airplanes are characters. ... But in the air, with John Lasseter executive producing and Klay Hall directing -- they really pushed for accuracy. These have to be airplanes. They have to fly like airplanes. They have to move like airplanes. We can't have them go faster than they would in real life compared to other airplanes. So they really did a good job of holding true to the aviation world. They really did go to great pains -- even down to the dialogue, the radio transmissions and everything -- to keep it as accurate as they could. CNN: Spill the beans: What inaccuracies did you notice? And what did the filmmakers change because of your comments? Bautista: Early on (in the production), I was spending hours watching reels. I would have page after page of comments. I looked at everything, from toys to artwork to script to story to dialogue, everything. I would (point out things that were inaccurate), and it would start affecting the story. And when that happens, everybody including Klay Hall and the writers gets involved in it. For example, Dusty is a crop duster who dreams about being a racer. The problem is: A crop duster is slow by design. So Dusty is physically limited, and he's going to be racing against planes that can go four times his speed. So how do you get around that? It was challenging. I'd say, 'Well, first you've got to get rid of the spray boom on the bottom (of the plane).' There's so much drag from that. In the movie, they treated that almost like a vasectomy. He doesn't want to lose valuable body parts. And I thought that was a pretty hilarious way that they did it. He needed to reduce drag, increase power -- and I don't want to give away too much -- but there was a lot they had to work around. At one point (the filmmakers said), 'OK, (Dusty's) racing an airliner ... to train himself.' And I'm like, 'That particular airliner he will never, ever, ever be able to catch. You need to change that airliner to a commuter turbo prop pulling in the opposite direction so it's eating headwinds ... Mostly, my inputs came in the military flying and the airliner stuff. And then looking at controls and things. I remember there's a scene where a big race starts, and they're starting their engines, and I had them freeze it, and I watched it back again. I told them that Chu -- one of the main characters -- his propeller is turning backwards. They said, ""What do you mean it's turning backwards?"" I said, ""Well, either his engine is rotating in the wrong direction, or his propeller -- the way it's built on him right now, he will go backwards."" And then they had me look, start looking at all the airplanes. And sure enough, I said ""that one would spin circles, because one engine was spinning backwards; one was spinning forwards."" Things like that. They didn't know or understand the relationship between rotation direction and pitch of the propeller. So there are things in the story that were driven by input that I made, where things like that got changed. As an aviation geek, you're going to find very little wrong with this movie. CNN: What actual aircraft are represented in this movie? Or are these characters just amalgamations of planes that might look familiar to us but are not actual aircraft that we might see in real life? Bautista: Some of them are amalgamations. Dusty is an amalgamation of three different types of crop dusters. Some of them are very close to the real thing. Skipper is an F4U Corsair. There are P-51 Mustangs in the movie. But a lot of the planes, especially the more modern airplanes like airliners and things like that, are what I call ""esque."" They're very 747-esque. Or Airbus A380-esque. The Navy airplanes are very F-18-esque, but they're not F-18s. They're close enough that any aviation enthusiast would recognize them right away. But I think for proprietary reasons, the characters had to be somewhat different. CNN: Do any of the movie characters in ""Planes"" remind you of yourself? Bautista: There are a few characters who have some of my call signs from the military days. Sparky and Dusty are some of my old fighter pilot call signs. But I kind of relate to all the characters. I really like Skipper because he's an old warrior -- an old fighter plane guy from World War ll. He carries a lot in the soul of his character and in his voice. I can relate to that because of some of the unseen, unknown events in his life in the past that affect who he is. Why is he quiet? Why is he kind of a shut-in? I can relate to Dusty and his energy and wanting to go beyond his limitations. I love the fighter characters Bravo and Echo that intercept Dusty. The military sequence was the most fun to work on. CNN: Tell us about your aviation background. Apparently, the filmmakers found someone who knows how to fly a lot of different kinds of aircraft. Bautista: I'm 55. My dad flew bombers in England and France during World War II and finished his career in Strategic Air Command. My brothers and I were all fascinated by airplanes; we grew up near a military base. My younger brother and I both had our pilot's licenses by the time we turned 17, which was the youngest age to get your pilot's license. I flew anything I could get my hands on. In college, I started flying commercially, hauling boxes for FedEx back when nobody knew who they were. I flew old radial engines, twin-engine aircraft called Beech 18 taildraggers. I ended up flying every single-engine Cessna, Piper and Beechcraft built and most of the light twins that they built, like the Cessna 310, 320, 340, 414, Beechcraft Barons, Piper Navajos. Then I wanted to know if I had what it took to be a fighter pilot. I was fortunate enough to get Air Force pilot training through the Air National Guard. I flew F-4 Phantoms and F-16s before retiring as a major. Then I chased another dream: to fly airliners. I ended up flying 737s, 727s, DC-10s and 747s for United. So I have a background in general aviation and then military fighters for 15 years and then commercial for the past 27 years. My son just got picked by the Air National Guard to fly F-15s, so the aviation legacy is continuing into the third generation.","A pilot/film consultant offers an aviation enthusiast's view of the new Disney film ""Planes""

"(CNN) -- The first couple weeks of each new year start with grandiose visions. This year, you will exercise like a maniac, eat well, start a rewarding relationship, advance your career and take amazing and exotic vacations. Now that we're halfway through January, some of that get-up-and-go has dissipated a wee bit, no? Don't abandon your entire ambitious agenda. At the very least, enrich yourself with a travel adventure. Hopefully, good fortune has shined upon your bank account in the form of a holiday bonus or an upcoming tax refund. Here are 12 ideas to get you started: . January: Scenic snowshoeing . Yes, January is slipping away fast, so this first option is an easy one for anyone who lives within striking distance of a heap of snow. Snowshoeing is pretty straightforward; it's bundled up hiking with special shoes. In some cases, it's also free. At Oregon's spectacular Crater Lake National Park, rangers lead free snowshoeing hikes (shoes included) each Saturday and Sunday (there's also one on MLK Jr. Day). Conservation organization Oregon Wild and outdoor clubs in snowy states like Vermont also arrange snowshoeing expeditions. You can rent shoes from outdoor outfitters for $10 to $20 per day. Plus, there's a romance factor. Oregon Wild wilderness coordinator Erik Fernandez proposed marriage on a full-moon snowshoeing outing. ""If you're looking for a romantic date, taking somebody on a full-moon snowshoe trip is going to score you some serious points,"" he said. Rewarding relationship, wintry adventure -- check, check. Blood falls and other natural oddities . February: Skiing inn-to-inn in Norway . Renew your fitness vows by cross-country skiing along the well-groomed Peer Gynt Trail in Gudbrandsdalen in south-central Norway. A seven-day self-guided trip organized by Norske Bygdeopplevelser has skiiers covering up to 16 miles a day. Your luggage is transferred from inn to inn as you ski alongside inspiring views of the Jotunheimen and Rondane mountains and Lake Gala. See? Outdoor exercise is a lovely pursuit. $1,550 per person for double occupancy, including lodging, train transfers to and from Oslo, luggage transport and most meals. Ski equipment is not included. Inside the beluga of the skies . March: Big game fishing in Panama . Panama's got world-class fishing, plus bragging rights if you hook something huge. Panama Big Game Fishing Club on Isla Boca Brava off the Pacific Coast offers four to seven-night fishing packages, starting at about $3,000 per person for four nights, including lodging, airport transfers and domestic flights, fishing expeditions and all meals and drinks. The waters near the lodge are home to a large population of billfish, including black marlin and Pacific sailfish as well as a host of other impressive swimmers. 8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels . April: A tall ship ocean crossing . Royal Clipper's 21-night Barbados to Rome trans-Atlantic crossing is for the truly committed sailor and ship enthusiast. ""They take the trip because they want to experience an uninterrupted stretch of sailing in open water, as there are 10 consecutive days at sea on this cruise. They also tend to be readers,"" said Buck Banks, a spokesman for Star Clippers. The ship stops in Portugal's Azores, Malaga, Mallorca and Menorca, Spain before reaching Rome. Weather permitting, passengers may have the opportunity to swim in the middle of the Atlantic. Brrrrr. The 42-sail, five-masted full-rigged Royal Clipper was inspired by the historic tall ship Preussen. Rates start at $5,878 per person for double occupancy. May: Tuscany biking . You'll want to stretch your legs now that you're back on dry land. Pedal through Tuscany with a six-night bike tour from Backroads. The verdant landscape, Medieval hilltop towns and Chianti wine tastings will take the edge off the rolling hills, and daily route options from ""easygoing"" to ""avid"" give you some wiggle room on your energy investment. (And there's shuttle support). Rates start at $4,398 per person for double occupancy. June: Spotting the Komodo dragon . To see a Komodo dragon in the wild, you have to go to Indonesia. Komodo National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site located in the center of the Indonesian archipelago, is home to more than 5,000 of the world's largest living lizards, the Varanus komodoensis. The park is made up of three main islands, Komodo, Rinca and Padar. Many outfitters run single and multi-day trips from Labuan Bajo on Flores. Guides are necessary as the dragons are dangerous. The area around the islands also boasts spectacular scuba diving. July: Swiss hut hiking . Hiking from one Alpine hut to another to see the famed Matterhorn is many a European's idea of a good time. For those not familiar with the tradition, why not explore the Haute Route taken by British climbers for the first time more than a century ago? Only experienced trekkers need apply, even on an organized tour, because the route can include daily altitude gains of more than 3,000 feet. U Track's Haute Route tour through Switzerland starts in Le Chable (near Verbier) and concludes in Zermatt, including views of the Matterhorn, Dent Blanche, Zinalrothorn and Weisshorn during the trip. Rates start at $1190. August: Burning Man Festival . Design your own desert sculpture. Turn your bicycle into a moving Oreo. Or create a mock Wall Street and burn it down, as artist Otto Von Danger did in 2012. The huge totem that's set ablaze in the Nevada desert, giving Burning Man its name, is just the tip of the iceberg that attracts free thinkers, radical artists and others wishing to break free of society's constraints. Purists complain that mainstream tourists changed the event with their RVs and plasma televisions -- hardly evidence of the self-reliance the organizers extoll. But as you watch ""the Burn"" when Burning Man gets torched, you may be transformed. Pre-sale tickets cost $650 plus fees. Need-based discounts are available. September: Coastal Portugal hiking . While Portugal is well known for its port wine tourism, many travelers are just starting to realize how much more Portugal's rugged Atlantic coast offers the adventurer. A new REI Adventures trip from Lisbon to the Algarve hits villages, beaches and castles, ending up on the windswept, far-western Sagres promontory, on the edge of the Old World. Enjoy the food and drink in lovely cafes and plazas as you rest each night. Rates start at $2,499 for REI members and $2,899 for nonmembers. (REI charges a one-time fee of $20 to become a member.) October: Climb to Mount Everest's base camp . Climbing Mount Everest is not for the faint of heart or body. Even the most experienced climbers have perished on the unforgiving mountainside. A trip to Everest's base camp, still only for the most physically fit, may be the way to start exploring this Nepalese wonder. National Geographic Expedition's 19-day Himalayan trek to Everest's Southern Face Base Camp combines days of hiking with exploration of ancient Thami and Tengboche monasteries as well as Sherpa villages. Prices start at $4,995. November: Search for South Africa's animals . There's never been a better time to explore all that South Africa has to offer. Go on safari, of course, but also explore this magnificent country while hiking, biking and kayaking. Spend three days on safari with REI Adventures at Sabi Sand Reserve, explore the Cape Winelands via bicycle, kayak to an African Penguin colony, hike Cape Town's Table Mountain and hike in the Drakensburg Mountains. Prices for REI members start at $6,999 and nonmember prices start at $7,700. December: Christmas kayaking in Costa Rica . If you've had enough of artificial Christmas trees and shopping mall-dictated presents, leave it all behind and head to Costa Rica for a nature adventure. Nestled between the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, this small Central American country has some of the most diverse animal life and lush landscape in the world. Not sure where to start? G Adventures' Costa Rica kayaking trip includes kayaking and standup paddling in Lake Arenal, kayaking through the canals around Tortuguero, a boat trip of Tortuguero National Park and a guided hike through the jungle. Prices start at $799.","Vow to do something truly memorable on vacation this year .

"(CNN) -- It's Valentine's Day, and the Olympic village is in the mood -- at least that's the story according to one champion athlete at this month's Games. Slopestyle gold medalist Jamie Anderson revealed she had to delete her account with online dating app Tinder before her snowboard event in order to focus on the Olympics. ""Tinder in the Olympic Village is next level,"" the 23-year-old from South Lake Tahoe, California said in an interview with the magazine U.S. Weekly published Wednesday. ""It's all athletes! In the mountain village it's all athletes. It's hilarious. There are some cuties on there. ""There was a point where I had to be like OK, this is way too distracting. I deleted my account to focus on the Olympics."" Tinder is a matchmaking app for smartphones that facilitates communication between nearby users, prompting them to decide whether they like each other on the basis of a photograph and a brief profile. If two users select ""like"" for one another, the match is made known to both individuals and they can begin messaging. With most athletes owning smartphones and being active on social media, it was perhaps inevitable that the increasingly popular Tinder would play Cupid at the Olympics. In fact, the company has experienced a 400% day-over-day increase of new users in Sochi since the Games began last Friday, Tinder CEO and founder Sean Rad told the Wall Street Journal. With almost 3,000 competitors staying in the Olympic Village alone, and that doesn't include support staff, officials, media and fans who are all staying nearby. This diverse mix of people from all corners of the globe, for what is essentially one big party over a three-week period, is perhaps why organizers have seen fit to supply roughly 100,000 condoms to the Olympic village. ""I haven't seen it in action but I've definitely heard the athletes' village is a melting pot of good-looking people at the top of their sport,"" U.S. snowboarder Alex Diebold told reporters. ""They do provide free condoms, which I think is a really smart move on their part. I think you can get them at the medical office. We're good-looking people all hanging out together and stuff like that is bound to happen,"" he added. Fellow American Jacqueline Hernandez said while she had been staying offline in the run-up to her snowboard cross event on Sunday, that was unlikely to remain the case for long. ""I haven't gotten on Tinder since I got here. I think after our event when we move up to the mountain (athletes' village) I will definitely try to Tinder it up,"" the 21-year-old said. But while some athletes have taken to modern technology in the search for that someone special in Sochi, others have kept it old-school. The traditional definition of Valentine's Day, after all, is for couples and singles to express their love -- openly or anonymously -- through cards, candy, flowers and gifts. ""If you have a girlfriend, you should tell her you love her every day,"" said Austrian snowboarder Hanno Douschan. ""Maybe when I get back to the athletes' village I will find a chocolate heart from the cleaning lady."" U.S. figure skater Ashley Wagner went one step further and tweeted a Valentine's card to herself, making light of her underwhelmed reaction to the judges' scorecards after she performed in the team event last weekend -- an image that went viral. Others are so focused on the competition, however, that Valentine's Day and the Tinder factor have barely registered. Australia's Tora Bright, who followed her 2010 halfpipe gold with silver in Sochi, had to be reminded it was February 14. ""Oh, it's Valentine's day today?"" the snowboarder asked. ""Every day is Valentine's day. I give my love to all my loved ones every day. ""Well I don't have a Valentine, so I'm just going to forget about it."" Swiss snowboarder Simona Meiler, meanwhile, was none too enamored with the focus on anything other than the sport. ""My plans for Valentine's Day is to go to the press conference, rest and get ready for tomorrow,"" the 24-year-old said. ""It's a day of preparation like any other. I've got other things on my mind, it's not my focus.""","Athletes at the Winter Olympics are using dating app Tinder .

"(CNN) -- Pop star Rihanna is adding major star power to the campaign for gay rights in Russia. The singer behind hits such as ""Disturbia"" and ""SOS""  tweeted a photo of herself wearing a hat emblazoned with P6, short for Principle 6. The campaign speaks out against Russia's anti-gay propaganda law as the nation hosts the Winter Olympics. Rihanna has 34 million followers on Twitter. The photo links to her Instagram account, which has about 12 million followers. In subsequent tweets, she posted links to other articles highlighting the issue. Equality group All Out tweeted the singer back. ""Whoah. Thank you @rihanna for standing up for #P6 and equality at the Olympics!"" the group posted. Russia has faced criticism for its policies involving homosexuality leading up to the Olympics in Sochi. In June, its parliament passed a law that makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. The international community has widely criticized the law as archaic and discriminatory. And last week, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has signed a decree banning foreign same-sex couples from adopting Russian children. The move also bans singles from countries where same-sex marriages are legal from adopting Russian children. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia, unlike some other countries, does not criminalize homosexual relationships. ""We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone,"" Putin said last month. ""That's why you can feel safe and free here, but please leave our children in peace.""","Rihanna posts a photo to her 34 million followers on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- A Greyhound passenger attacked the driver on a moving bus early Thursday in Arizona, police said, sending the vehicle on a jostling ride that injured 24 people. But quick-acting passengers helped prevent what could have been a gruesome outcome, authorities said. The assailant approached the driver, hit him and tried to take control of the wheel as the bus headed east on Interstate 10 around 1:45 a.m. roughly 50 miles west of Phoenix, police said. That sent the vehicle bouncing across an uneven median, Arizona Department of Public Safety Officer Carrick Cook said. Other passengers jumped to their feet, subdued the attacker and helped the driver stop the bus in the median, just seconds before it would have barreled head-on into other vehicles, police said. ""This thing traveled about 300 feet in the median, bouncing up and down, and that's where the injuries occurred,"" Cook said. "" ... I think the officer (at the scene) said it was about 6 feet from going into oncoming traffic."" Police said they believe the attacker was Maquel Donyel Morris, 25. He fled into the desert, but returned 30 minutes later and was arrested, Cook said. It wasn't immediately clear what led to the attack, Cook said. Among the injured, one suffered fractures to the lower body, and one sustained a back injury, Cook said. At least 21 were taken to hospitals, he said. No immediate public statement was made on Morris' behalf.","A passenger attacked a driver on moving bus on an Arizona interstate .

"Kuala Lumpur (CNN) -- Launching off a 300-meter-high tower platform with only seconds to pull your rip cord might sound like the act of an insane person. But that's exactly what 103 base jumpers from 20 countries -- presumably all of sound mind -- did in Malaysia over the weekend. The jumps were part of the annual KL Tower International Jump 2013, held in Kuala Lumpur from September 27 to 30. Kat Donahue, 32, a location manager from the United States, was one of six women jumping this year. ""A lot of people do say I'm crazy but my family is pretty supportive,"" she said. ""Jumping can be scary, but when you calm your nerves and become quiet it's very peaceful out there, meditative. Base jumping can be solitary but this is such a social event, it's great."" This year's jump also welcomed Sean Chuma from the U.S., a pioneer in tandem base jumps, and Lonnie Bissonnette, a paraplegic base jumper from Canada. More: 10 things to know before visiting Malaysia . ""Lonnie is inspiring for me as there are extra risks involved for him, but he has been jumping for years,"" said event organizer Gary Cunningham, 42, an electronic engineer from Australia. ""Unfortunately his accident was caused by base jumping, but he highlights how if one avenue closes you focus on what you can do. Lonnie has been able to do some pretty amazing stuff."" Cunningham has been organizing the Kuala Lumpur event since 2005 and has around 2,900 jumps under his belt. He said if you want to try base jumping, start by skydiving. ""Through skydiving you learn precision falling and how to handle parachutes. You also learn how to deal with things when they go wrong. The potential risk is very real."" World's worst pick-up line? With risk comes reward -- the ultimate adrenalin buzz. But you'd be mistaken to assume that saying you're a base jumper works as a pick-up line. ""It doesn't help you pick up women, it helps you lose them actually,"" said Peter Wyllie, 33, a junior doctor from Australia. ""Women tend to see base jumpers as not a particularly secure future. Who wants to have babies with someone who is committed to tracking down a 4,000 foot wall?"" The point was echoed by David Laffargue, 24, from France. ""Some women say they're scared of the sport, but then I do also spend all my time and money on base jumping!"" '100% of people who drink bottled water die' Base jumping is dangerous. From 1981 to the present there have been more than 200 fatalities related to the sport. The base jumping community tries to minimize risks. In order to leap from the KL Tower, which opened in the Malaysian capital in 1996, jumpers need to have two years of experience and more than 120 jumps under their belt. More: 10 best islands for a Malaysia holiday . Veteran base jumper Chris ""Douggs"" McDougall, 37, known for shouting ""ready, steady, spaghetti"" as he throws himself off the edge, stresses safety. ""It's not about having [guts], it's about arming yourself with knowledge -- risk management is key,"" he said. ""We accept what we do is dangerous but we want to see everyone walk away safely. One hundred percent of people who drink bottled water die. Life is a risk. If you accept that you will die you get on with living. Base jumpers focus on the positive."" Insane? ""Bonkers,"" ""mad"" and ""nuts"" were adjectives hurled at jumpers by spectators attached to the tower's ledge with safety harnesses, as they looked over the edge and snapped photos. ""We didn't realize the festival was going on,"" said UK tourist Jessica Pugh, standing on the open deck of the tower watching jumpers leap. ""We were just sat in Nando's and saw someone fall off the tower -- we thought they'd jumped,"" added her partner, Jordan Lott. ""Thankfully we saw them pull the parachute.

"(CNN) -- Spanish authorities went fishing for backpacks full of cocaine and netted nearly a ton of the drug after uncovering what they say was a sophisticated undersea smuggling operation. The ring used packs equipped with a flotation system designed to keep them below the surface without sinking. Spain's Civil Guard said Monday it has seized 37 of the packs, which were tagged with satellite tracking devices, with nearly 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) of cocaine inside. Smugglers had been using the submersible packs to smuggle the drugs between Malaga and Valencia, along the country's Mediterranean coast, according to the Civil Guard, Spain's national police force. Investigators had been tracking the suspects since May and made five arrests in those cities, it said. Authorities seized 72,000 euros ($97,000), three vehicles and an unspecified vessel in the raids. They also impounded jewelry and luxury watches, computer equipment and phones, the Civil Guard said.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Locked in a battle with her brothers over their family treasures, the daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. said Thursday she'd once considered lending them but never selling them. Bernice King says her brothers' plan to sell their father's Bible and the Nobel Peace Prize he was awarded 1964. Dexter and Martin Luther King III have sued to force their sister to turn over those items, and a judge has ordered the items stored in a safe deposit box that only the court can open until the case is resolved. In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, Bernice King acknowledged that she had once considered selling other heirlooms, including the Spingarn Medal the NAACP awarded her father in 1957. But she said she had never believed it was acceptable to sell the Nobel Prize medal or King's traveling Bible, which was used by President Barack Obama when he was sworn in for his second term. ""At the time I agreed in 2007 to the potential transfer of certain memorabilia to the National Center for Human and Civil Rights, it was totally consistent with furthering the King legacy because of the nature of their mission,"" she said. ""They are a civil rights center. But let it be noted that I have and always will object to the sale of the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible as I believe the sale of those items is sacrilegious and a breach of my obligation as a steward and trustee of my father's legacy."" King was assassinated in 1968, and his widow, Coretta Scott King, died in 2006. In court papers, the King brothers submitted an e-mail inventory Bernice King wrote in 2007 that divided items from the estate of the civil rights leader into four categories: those she would be willing to sell, including the Spingarn Medal; items she would not be willing to sell, but might consider lending, such as the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible; items that had questions associated with them; and items she would have to examine before deciding. But in Thursday's statement, Bernice King said that now, ""I would not support the sale of most of the memorabilia listed in the 2007 e-mail."" The CEO of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, Doug Shipman, told CNN on Thursday that he had no comment on the legal proceedings and that his center had not bought any items from the King estate. But he said the center plans to display King papers sold several years ago by the estate and now owned by Morehouse College. Bernice King, who was 5 when her father was assassinated, is acting as the ""gatekeeper"" to her father's property, said attorney William Hill, who represents the King estate. He said she has no individual claim to the property that belongs to the estate controlled by her brothers. Wednesday, Fulton County Superior Judge Robert McBurney ordered the disputed items placed ""in a safe deposit box in an unknown location."" But he warned Bernice King it was likely that her brothers would be able to show ""the Bible and peace prize are possessions of the estate."" According to the King brothers' complaint, King's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., but Bernice King has ""secreted and sequestered"" the items in question. Bernice King has said her brothers told her on January 22 that they wanted the items so they could sell them. Her attorney, Eric Barnum, called the attempt to sell the items a ""money grab,"" saying there's a history of the King sons taking money made from selling possessions to line their own pockets. The judge compared Bernice King's stance against the sale of her father's possessions to Coca-Cola not wanting to sell its secret soft drink recipe. He later noted he was not trivializing the value of King's possessions with the comparison. This is not the first time the family has been at odds over King's legacy. Over the years, the siblings have sued and countersued one another. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting ""substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America"" for his own use. They agreed to a settlement, thereby avoiding a trial.","NEW: Bernice King says she weighed lending MLK's Nobel Prize and Bible, but not selling .

"(CNN) -- Parts of the Eastern United States on Friday fended off freezing rain and snow as a powerful winter storm lumbered through the Great Lakes, driving thunderstorms eastward. The National Weather Service predicted the storm would affect the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes and the Northeast, with blizzard conditions in Minnesota and Iowa and strong winds across a portion of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. Severe storms -- with wind and large hail -- were possible from Boston to Miami, said CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh. Frozen conditions may have been a factor in a crash early Friday in Maine that left a driver dead. An SUV driver lost control of the vehicle while it was traveling on a snow-covered stretch in Somerville and slammed into a big rig, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office said. Several New York-area airports -- LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark in northern New Jersey -- were experiencing ground delays as of 6 p.m, due to limited visibility, the Federal Aviation Administration reported online. The wild weather also brought strong winds to parts of the Southeast and mid-Atlantic, though that threat was over by evening. Before then, the weather service reported two possible tornadoes early Friday afternoon in south-central Georgia, including one in Johnson County that damaged 12 buildings, including ripping the front doors off a fire station. There was also an EF0 tornado -- indicating 65 to 85 mph winds lasting three seconds or more -- in Compton, Maryland, 60 miles southeast of Washington, D.C. Heavy winds also downed trees in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, while up to quarter-size hail was reported on Florida's Atlantic coast around St. Augustine. This all came on the heels of severe storms that struck Illinois late Thursday afternoon, knocking out power, damaging buildings and spawning floods, the National Weather Service reported. On Thursday night, storms and high winds swept across Tennessee, pelting Nashville with rain and hail and leaving thousands in the dark. In Illinois, damaging wind and golf ball-size hail were reported overnight. About 24,000 people in the state lost power, according to utility Ameren Illinois. Effingham and Champaign counties in Illinois reported flooding. ""We have some power lines down and a little water in the road in some places,"" said Pam Jacobs, director of the Effingham County Emergency Management Agency. John Dwyer, emergency management coordinator for Champaign County, reported road flooding and standing water in farm fields. He said the flooding was caused by 3 inches of rain Thursday coupled with the snow melt. The National Weather Service said radar indicated rainfall of 3 to 4 inches per hour. The Illinois State Police reported that fog caused a wreck on Interstate 57 in northeast Illinois, involving at least 27 vehicles. Authorities said they received reports of injuries, none of them life-threatening. As the storm moved eastward, winds knocked down dozens of trees in Nashville, reported CNN affiliate WSMV-TV. The station said trained weather spotters reported 1-inch hail and 95-mph winds. CNN's Ed Payne, Greg Botelho and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","NEW: Low visibility causes ground delays at three New York-area airports .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A court in Zimbabwe sentenced former U.S. Rep. Melvin Reynolds to a $100 fine or five days in prison, coupled with immediate deportation, after he pleaded guilty Friday to flouting the country's immigration laws. Reynolds' attorney, Arthur Gurira, told CNN that his client intended to pay the fine Saturday morning when the former congressman should be released. He then faces deportation. A magistrates' court cleared Reynolds of a second charge of being found in possession of pornographic material after the prosecution failed to produce authority from the prosecutor-general to proceed with the case. Reynolds was arrested Monday in Zimbabwe. He reportedly entered the country in November on a 14-day visa, which was only renewed once and has expired. Police sources said the former Democratic congressman refused to reveal passwords to encrypted files, which officials said contained pornographic material. Reynolds was first elected to represent Illinois' 2nd Congressional District in 1992. He resigned three years later, shortly after his conviction on charges of criminal sexual assault, obstruction of justice and solicitation of child pornography in a case stemming from his relationship with a 16-year-old campaign worker.","NEW: Attorney: Ex-lawmaker will pay $100 fine rather than spend five days in prison .

"(CNN) -- Twenty milligrams; that's the average amount of carbon emissions generated from the time it took you to read the first two words of this article. How green is your website? Calculating all the factors involved in a website can be tricky. Now, depending on how quickly you read, around 80, perhaps even 100 milligrams of C02 have been released. And in the several minutes it will take you to get to the end of this story, the number of milligrams of greenhouse gas emitted could be several thousand, if not more. This may not seem like a lot: ""But in aggregate, if you consider all the people visiting a web site and then all the seconds that each of them spends on it, it turns out to be a large number,"" says Dr. Alexander Wissner-Gross, an Environmental Fellow at Harvard University who studies the environmental impact of computing. Wissner-Gross estimates every second someone spends browsing a simple web site generates roughly 20 milligrams of C02. Whether downloading a song, sending an email or streaming a video, almost every single activity that takes place in the virtual environment has an impact on the real one. As millions more go online each year some researchers say the need to create a green Internet ecosystem is not only imperative but also urgent. ""It is part of the whole sustainability picture,"" Chris Large, head of research and development at UK-based Climate Action Group, told CNN. ""Scientists are saying to us that we have 10 years to take some serious action to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change so taking some sort of initiative is absolutely vital."" A number of studies have highlighted the growing energy demands of computers. A 2007 report from research firm Gartner, for example, estimates the manufacturing, use and disposal of information and communications technology generates about two percent of the world's greenhouse gases -- similar to the level produced by the entire aviation industry.  Watch the report on efforts to turn tech green » . Anti-virus software firm McAfee reports that the electricity needed just to transmit the trillions of spam emails sent annually equals the amount required to power over two million homes in the United States while producing the same level of greenhouse gas emissions as more than three million cars. ""Most people don't appreciate that the computer on your desk is contributing to global warming and that if its electricity comes from a coal power plant it produces as much C02 as a sports utility vehicle,"" said Bill St. Arnaud of Canarie, a Canada-based internet development organization. ""Some studies estimate the internet will be producing 20 percent of the world's greenhouse gases in a decade. That is clearly the wrong direction. That is clearly unsustainable,"" added St. Arnaud. What do you include when working out IT's carbon footprint? Calculating the carbon footprint of the entire web however is not as easy as measuring the greenhouse gas emissions of a car. Data centers -- massive buildings housing hundreds, if not thousands, of power hungry servers storing everything from Facebook photos and YouTube videos to company web sites and personal emails -- are often labeled as the worst offenders when it comes to harming the environment. In 2002, global data center emissions amounted to 76 million tons of carbon dioxide -- a figure that is likely to more than triple over the next decade, according to a 2008 study by the Climate Group and Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). The footprint of network infrastructure, which is responsible for transporting information from data centers to personal computers, mobile phones and other devices, is harder to pinpoint. However the same study estimates fixed broadband accounts for around four million tons of carbon emissions and could account for nearly 50 million tons of emissions by 2020. The manufacturing, transport and use of personal computers and laptops also has what some say is the most significant impact, producing roughly 200 million tons of emissions in 2002. As millions of people buy new laptops and computers every year, this figure could triple by the end of the next decade, according to the Climate Group report. And it is also true that, like driving a car compared to taking public transportation, some online activities produce more greenhouse gases than others. More electricity is needed to store, transmit and download a video compared to a simple email, for example. A single search using Google releases 0.2 grams of C02 into the atmosphere, according to Google. ""And what that includes is the energy that we at Google use to be able to receive your search, process it and then send it back to you,"" Erik Teetzel, one of Google's ""green"" engineers, told CNN. ""If people are counting things outside the activity that we do, then we don't have control over that so we don't factor that into the equation,"" said Teetzel. ""We can measure exactly the number of queries that we service and come up with a very accurate estimate and answer from measured results of our actual emissions or energy use per query that we serve."" The drive for energy efficiency . Citing competitive reasons, Teetzel declined to divulge Google's annual power bill, yet he said the internet company has been taking steps to make its main six, five megawatt server farms green as well as the other, smaller data centers it has around the world. It is doing this by using more renewable energy, recycled water and efficient software that requires less electricity to run. ""From a business perspective, it makes sense to get the most what you want to call useful work done using the least amount of resources,"" said Teetzel. ""Our energy efficiency efforts really did stem from us making our business more competitive."" A number of other companies are also working to take the various pieces that comprise the infrastructure of the internet in a more sustainable direction. Wissner-Gross of Harvard has a company called C02Stats that enables businesses to monitor and manage the environmental impact of their web sites and then purchase renewable energy certificates based on their sites' monthly carbon footprint. Netherlands-based Cleanbits lobbies web sites to go green by either by purchasing carbon offsets or switching to green hosting providers, like AISO.net, a solar-powered data center based in California. And, like Google, Yahoo also incorporates renewable power and other efficiency measures in its data centers. However as more of the world joins an age characterized by global flows of information and communication, some say the role the internet plays in making the lives of millions not only more efficient but also environmentally friendly should not be discounted. ""I don't think we've done a good deal with articulating the fact that IT is inherently an efficiency tool,"" said Teetzel. ""That is why you and I use the internet now to find out a lot of information that would have previously been found by us getting in a car and driving somewhere."" ""It is a little bit unfair to say that you have this huge carbon cost of the IT industry without articulating the fact that in many, many cases it offsets what I would call heavier, more carbon intense activities that we do in our daily lives,"" he added. ""Moving electrons is far more efficient than moving atoms. It is actually a paradigm change.""","Every second spent web-browsing generates 20 milligrams of CO2 .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Civilian casualties resulting from Afghanistan's war have spiked, jumping some 24 percent above figures from last year, the United Nations reported Friday. An Afghan child allegedly hurt during a U.S.-led air strike earlier this year. The Human Rights Unit of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan announced it recorded 1,013 civilian deaths in Afghanistan during the first six months of this year. That compares to 818 Afghan civilians who were killed during the same period in 2008, while 684 civilians were killed during the first half of 2007. Insurgent roadside bombs and suicide attacks, as well as air strikes conducted by U.S. and NATO forces, are the two deadliest tactics being used in Afghanistan. Fifty-nine percent of this year's civilian casualties resulted from insurgent bombs. Western military airstrikes killed 30.5 percent of the civilians. The report concluded that Taliban insurgents are ""basing themselves in civilian areas so as to deliberately blur the distinction between combatants and civilians, and as part of what appears to be an active policy aimed at drawing a military response to areas where there is a high likelihood that civilians will be killed."" The UN highlighted a pattern of deadly Taliban attacks, targeting humanitarian workers, government employees, medical and educational staff... and in particular, girls' schools. Meanwhile, the UN noted that NATO forces have redrafted their tactical directives, in an effort to reduce civilian casualties. Despite the creation last year of a military commission to track civilian deaths, Western airstrikes ""remain responsible for the largest percentage of civilian deaths"" attributed to foreign troops in Afghanistan. The UN stated that these civilian casualties are counterproductive for the Western military coalition, because they are ""undermining support for the continued presence of the international military forces and the international community generally."" The United States has nearly doubled the number of American forces in Afghanistan since last year. US-NATO troops have mounted on of the biggest military operations of the eight year war, in an effort to route Taliban insurgents from safe havens in Southern Afghanistan, ahead of August 20th presidential elections. The intensified military activities have contributed to making June the deadliest month for Western forces for the war. At least 44 American service members died in the conflict zone this month, in addition to some 29 Coalition forces.","Civilian casualties in Afghanistan war have spiked by 24 percent .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North and South Korea will hold a ""high-level meeting"" Wednesday ahead of planned family reunions of people from the two countries, Seoul said Tuesday. ""No agenda was set prior to this meeting,"" Kim Eui-do, a spokesman for the South Korean Unification Ministry said. ""But we expect that there will be comprehensive dialogue on the smooth operation of these family reunions, holding the family reunions on a regular basis and other important areas of interest."" The talks will start Wednesday morning at the Panmunjom Peace House, which is on the South's side of the heavily militarized border, Kim said. Pyongyang said last week it may back out of the reunions of the families -- who were separated by the Korean War in the 1950s -- if South Korean forces participate in annual joint military exercises with the United States later this month. The reunions of about 200 people -- 100 from each country -- are scheduled to take place between February 20 and 25 at a resort on the North's side of the heavily militarized border. The annual military drills, which are due to start on February 24, anger the North Korean regime, which says it views them as a prelude to an invasion. Last year, Pyongyang's threatening rhetoric reached alarming levels during the exercises, heightening tensions in the region. South Korea and the United States have rejected the North's calls for this year's joint drills to be called off. In September, North Korea canceled a previous round of family reunions with only a few days notice, accusing Seoul of souring ties between the two countries. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","The talks will take place on the South Korean side of the border .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration recently issued a warning to doctors about prescribing medications with more than 325 milligrams of acetaminophen. Although acetaminophen is harmless in small doses, it can cause liver damage if taken incorrectly. Here are five things you should know about this popular painkiller: . 1. It's not great for muscle pain. Acetaminophen is part of a class of painkillers called non-opioid analgesics, which are used to treat mild or moderate pain. These include acetaminophen, ibuprofen and aspirin. Non-opiod analgesics block an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase, or COX, according to Ewan McNicol, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Tufts University. COX helps the body produce lipid compounds called prostaglandins that cause pain and inflammation when your cells are injured. Blocking this enzyme, therefore, helps prevent prostaglandins from causing you pain. Most non-opiod analgesics work in the peripheral nervous system, or the nerves not included in your brain and spinal cord. But scientists believe acetaminophen works primarily in the central nervous system, attacking a slightly different form of the enzyme called COX-3. ""What this means to you is that acetaminophen is great for headaches, fever and minor aches and pains but won't reduce inflammation due to, say, a muscle sprain,"" McNicol explained. 2. It's found in more than Tylenol. Though many people know that acetaminophen in the active ingredient in Tylenol, it's also found in many other over-the-counter drugs including (but not limited to) some Excedrin, Robitussin and Sudafed products. Acetaminophen is also used in combination with opioids in prescription pain medications such as Percocet, Vicodin and Tylenol with codeine. To find out whether your medications contain acetaminophen, read the drug label or the list of ingredients in the patient information leaflet that came with your prescription. Look for the word ""acetaminophen"" or the letters ""APAP,"" an abbreviation sometimes used for the drug. If you are still unsure, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 3. It's easy to accidentally take too much. The FDA has set the recommended daily maximum for adults at 4,000 milligrams. It's easier to reach this limit than you might think; one gel tablet of Extra Strength Tylenol, for example, contains 500 mg. Taking too much acetaminophen can lead to liver failure or death. Overdoses of the popular painkiller are some of the most common poisonings worldwide, according to the National Institutes of Health. In April 2009, the FDA introduced new labeling requirements for drug manufacturers. Any product that contains acetaminophen must prominently identify the active ingredient on its display panel and must warn consumers about the potential for liver toxicity. Consumers should not take more than the prescribed dose of any medication that contains acetaminophen, according to the FDA, and should avoid taking more than one acetaminophen product at a time. 4. It's not the best way to fight a hangover. Most of us have popped a couple of painkillers after a night out to ward off a hangover. But experts say you should choose carefully when opening the medicine cabinet, especially if you're a chronic heavy drinker. Taking acetaminophen with alcohol, even in small amounts, can increase your risk of liver damage and/or kidney disease. Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver, where it is turned into nontoxic compounds that are eliminated through urination. But the liver needs something called glutathione to do that. If your glutathione levels are low -- which can be caused by chronic drinking, an unhealthy diet or fasting -- the drug may be metabolized into a more toxic substance, according to the National Institutes of Health. Liver damage may occur after taking as few as four or five extra-strength pills over the course of the day, one NIH publication on alcohol and metabolism says. And another study showed that taking the recommended dose of acetaminophen with a small to moderate amount of alcohol can increase your risk of kidney disease by 123%. You may not notice the signs of liver damage right away, the FDA says; some symptoms like loss of appetite and nausea can be mistaken for the flu (or that hangover). If you suspect you're at risk, contact your doctor immediately. 5. It's not like ""a spoonful of sugar."" Children can take acetaminophen to fight pain or a fever, but parents should read drug labels carefully to avoid dosage errors. The ""directions"" section of the label tells you whether the medicine is right for your child and how much to give, the NIH's website says (PDF). ""If a dose for your child's weight or age is not listed on the label or you can't tell how much to give, ask your pharmacist or doctor what to do."" Liquid acetaminophen for infants and children is now sold in the same concentration: 160 mg/5 mL. That means infants need less; acetaminophen products for infants are usually packaged with an oral syringe instead of a dropper. Parents should always use the measuring tool that comes with the medication, the FDA says -- never a kitchen spoon. If your child takes too much acetaminophen, seek medical attention right away. You can also call the 24-hour Poison Control Center at 800-222-1222.","Acetaminophen is a non-opioid analgesic and is used to treat mild or moderate pain .

"(CNN) -- Western intelligence missed a chance to capture or kill the suspected terrorist thought to be behind the Nairobi mall massacre, according to a former informant for both the CIA and the Danish intelligence service. Morten Storm, who worked as an informant for five years, had forged a close relationship with the man -- a Kenyan called Ikrima -- who has been responsible for planning attacks inside Kenya for Al-Shabaab. Storm, a Danish national, told CNN that in March 2012 the Danish intelligence agency PET had offered him one million Danish krone ($200,000) on behalf of the CIA if he could lead them to Ikrima, the target of an unsuccessful operation by US Navy SEALs last month. The SEALs raided an Al-Shabaab compound at Barawe on the Somali coast, but Ikrima escaped. Storm's told CNN it is possible he might have got wind of the plans had he still been working for Western intelligence. But his relationship with PET and the CIA ended in mid-2012 amid disagreement about a different mission in Yemen. ""I get really frustrated to know that Ikrima had been maybe involved in the Westgate terrorist attack. It frustrates me a lot because it could have been stopped and I'm sad I can't be involved in this."" The CIA refused to comment on Storm's claims; a spokesperson for the PET told CNN: ""We can't confirm or deny ever knowing Morten Storm."" Kenyan counter-terrorism sources have told CNN they believe Ikrima had a hand in the Westgate attack as well as a string of plots targeting Kenya in the last two years, including a plot to target Kenya's parliament in late 2011. Read more: Kenya mall suspects to appear in court . Storm said he first put Ikrima on the radar screen of Western intelligence in 2008 when he met him in Nairobi for the first time. In the spring of 2009 Storm met Ikrima in Nairobi again. Abdelkadir Warsame, a senior Al-Shabaab operative, had sent Ikrima to meet Storm to pick up electronic equipment for one of Al-Shabaab's leaders. What Ikrima did not know was that Storm was working for PET, MI6, and the CIA, and that tracking devices had been hidden in the equipment, which included a laptop. The equipment, according to Storm's Al-Shabaab handlers, was for Saleh al Nabhan, one of the senior planners of the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi. Several months later Nabhan was targeted and killed in a U.S. Navy SEALs operation. Storm's Al-Shabaab contacts subsequently told him they believed Nabhan had been tracked through the electronic equipment but blamed a junior courier. After Al-Shabaab carried out a twin suicide bombing attack in Kampala, Uganda in July 2010 Ikrima told Storm it was now difficult for him to travel to meet him in Nairobi. From then on the two kept in frequent touch through encrypted emails -- which CNN has seen -- providing Western intelligence with real-time information on his movements and plans. In early 2010 Storm connected Ikrima to Anwar al Awlaki, the American-Yemeni cleric who had by then begun overseeing al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's operations against the West. According to Storm the two then began communicating over encrypted emails. They eventually came up with a joint plan of action to attack the West: Ikrima would send Shabaab recruits, including Westerners, to Yemen for terrorist training, and they would then be sent back to Somalia or on to the West. ""And as for going to hooks [Awlaki's] place ... then i was told by hook that they want to train brothers and then send them back or to the west,"" Ikrima wrote to Storm in November 2010. Read more: Did 'White Widow' spy on Kenya mall? Storm believes Ikrima's connection to Awlaki -- and his delivery of equipment secretly supplied by Western intelligence - enabled Ikrima to quickly climb Al-Shabaab's hierarchy. ""He was one of the smartest ones I met in east Africa,"" he told CNN. Storm told CNN that Ikrima helped oversee an intelligence apparatus -- ""Amniyat"" - Al-Shabaab set up in Kenya. ""He's the main link between Somalia and the Al Hijra group back here in Kenya,"" one of Ikrima's former associates told CNN in Nairobi. Al Hijra is a militant outfit in Kenya closely associated with Al-Shabaab. Storm said that Ikrima was at the center of a spiderweb connecting terrorist operatives in Somalia, Kenya, Yemen, and the West. He said he had emerged as the chief handler of foreign fighters, including Westerners joining Al-Shabaab, placing him in a unique opportunity to plot terrorist attacks in East Africa and Europe. His intelligence, language skills and connections appear to have now made Ikrima invaluable to Al-Shabaab. Two former friends of Ikrima -- including a former member of Al-Shabaab, told CNN he was now a strategist and planner for the group, rather than a fighter. ""He's part of the intelligence team. He speaks five languages - Norwegian, Swahili, Arabic, Somali, and English - and that puts him in a front seat with Al-Shabaab,"" one of his associates told CNN. Storm and the two former associates have shed light on how a middle class Kenyan became one of the most wanted terrorists in east Africa. Read more: Suspicion over Norwegian's roll in mall attack . Ikrima, now believed to be in his late twenties, was born in Mombasa into a middle class ethnic Somali family who also had blood links to the Al-Ansi tribe in Yemen, a connection which later helped Ikrima forge a relationship with AQAP. The family moved to Nairobi when he was young where he excelled in his studies, especially in French and other languages. His friends remembered him as not particularly religious and fond of smoking marijuana. He moved to Norway in 2004 apparently to seek out economic opportunities in Europe, taking advantage of the fact that his Somali ethnicity allowed him to apply for refugee status. He was granted temporary travel papers, but he never fit in, and started to become radicalized. A 2006 offensive by Ethiopian troops to rid Somalia of the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamist militia that had taken control of much of the country, appears to have played a significant role. Storm said Ikrima had told him he had joined the Islamic Courts Union in Somalia and experienced the invasion by Ethiopian troops first hand. He suspects the experience instilled in Ikrima a deep commitment to Jihad. According to his friends when he returned to Norway he was told his application for asylum had been rejected, and he moved to London for several months. In 2008 Ikrima left Europe for good and returned to east Africa. Western counter-terorrism officials fear his reputation in Jihadist circles worldwide will be bolstered by his escape from the U.S. operation, and he may be emboldened to plot new attacks.

"(CNN) -- Ilse Knecht has worked with victims of disturbing voyeuristic trends such as ""upskirting"" and ""downblousing."" One woman showered for years in a swimsuit after a peeping incident involving her landlord, Knecht said. Others stopped wearing skirts entirely. ""Victims say people don't understand the impact of this crime,"" said Knecht, a policy expert at the Washington-based National Center for Victims of Crime. ""It feels like a combination of a kind a sexual assault and stalking. It is very harmful."" The subject of modern-day peeping Toms made national headlines this week when Massachusetts' highest court ruled that a man who snapped cell phone photos up the skirt of women on the Boston subway did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude, as stipulated by a state law against secretive photography. The controversial decision overruled a lower court that upheld charges against Michael Robertson, who was arrested in August 2010, after police set up a sting following reports that he was using his cell phone to take ""upskirt"" photos and videos of women without their knowledge. ""A female passenger on a MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is 'partially nude,' no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing,"" wrote Justice Margot Botsford of the state Supreme Judicial Court. In Massachusetts, prosecutors and state lawmakers called for a revision of the law. After state House Speaker Robert DeLeo said the legislature would seek to close the loophole in the law quickly, the House and state Senate on Thursday passed a bill making ""upskirting"" illegal, with the measure going to the governor for signing. Armed with smartphones, iPads or other high-tech gadgetry, peeping Toms are snapping pictures of unsuspecting women in public places and sharing the images on the Web. Keyword searches on web browsers and social media sites such as Facebook and Instragram turn up multiple hits for ""upskirting"" and ""downblousing"" sites displaying surreptitious images of women's private body areas. ""There's an epidemic around street harassment broadly, but also we've received tons of 'upskirt' reports as well,"" said Emily May, executive director of ihollaback.org, a Web site that encourages women to share their stories and cell phone photographs of harassers and peeping Toms. ""I think there's a fear among people that you could have an 'upskirt' photo taken of you and never realize it. Your crotch could be on the Internet and you may never know about it."" Knecht said some states have taken steps to deal with high-tech peeping, but many others have failed to update antiquated voyeurism laws that are on the books. In Florida, for instance, video voyeurism is a felony. Washington state changed its law to add language noting that people have an expectation of privacy in public as well as private spaces. Knecht said states such as Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wisconsin have not updated laws to make the distribution of such images or videos on the Web a crime. In 2004, Congress passed a federal law making it a crime to photograph people's ""private area(s)"" on federal properties, including national parks and military bases or to broadcast such images. But states are responsible for making high-tech peeping a crime elsewhere. ""We don't know how many (incidents) happen and victims don't know about it,"" Knecht said. ""But when the cases do come, I think that we need laws that cover them. What we know about these cases is, it's not only one picture taken for somebody's personal gratification. That happens sometimes. But other times people are taking the pictures and putting them on the Internet and they're going even international. It's not just one instance of victimization, it's many."" Susan Gallagher, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Lowell whose specialty is gender, privacy and politics, said that stricter ""upskirting"" laws could make the practice more tantalizing to voyeurs. ""It's only because it's creepy that people do this,"" she said. ""You could see obviously a lot more of women's bodies in other places. 'Upskirting' doesn't really reveal much of women's bodies. You could see way more on the Internet if you just wanted to."" She added, ""I think the only thrill is the surreptitiousness of it. She doesn't know. She's sort of turned into, like, this passive object."" Gallagher said that snapping pictures of perpetrators and making them public is more of a deterrent. ""That's much more effective,"" she said. ""The picture takers don't want to be outed. You're shaming them."" When Gallagher lived in New York City, she said, men exposed themselves to her on two occasions. ""The way I got back was I didn't react,"" she said. ""I said, 'Oh, hello,' as if there was nothing going on. He was crestfallen. He wanted me to be shocked. I think the picture taking is the same sort of defense. You're going against the expectations of the perpetrator."" But May said the hollaback! site -- backed by activists in 71 cities and 24 countries -- is not about revenge. In fact, the group prefers educating harassers than penalizing them, she said: ""We're really trying to bring awareness."" Still, May said there is value in the digital stories and pictures from victims. ""What's amazing about it is your ability to turn the lens on them right when you're being harassed,"" she said. ""It's certainly a very empowering thing.""","Subject of modern-day peeping Toms brought to light by Massachusetts court ruling .

"(CNN) -- Patty Schemel, the former drummer for the Courtney Love-fronted band Hole, is starring in the upcoming documentary ""Hit So Hard."" The film examines Schemel's roots, her rise to fame with Hole and her drug addiction. Schemel spoke to CNN about ""Hit So Hard,"" her relationship with Love and Kurt Cobain, and her thoughts on women in the music industry today. CNN: ""Hit So Hard"" highlights the time in your life when you were a member of Hole during the peak period of the grunge rock era. Have you been in touch with your former band mates since you left Hole in 1998? Were you in contact with them during the course of filming? Patty Schemel: I kept in contact with Courtney (Love) over the years, I knew where she was at with that. Seeing the first edit of the documentary and how (Hole band mates) explained that time was pretty much the first time I got to know what their feelings were. Brought us all back together in a way. Just me reaching out to say ""thank you"" for doing the interview and to sort of talk about that. And then we all met together at the New Directors New Films film festival at MoMA (New York's Museum of Modern Art) last year. First time we were all together. So much around at that time because I had not been in the same room together with them since I walked out of the studio (13 years ago, recording the ""Celebrity Skin"" album). Nothing had changed in terms of waiting for Courtney, and that was the situation that night. Good to see everyone, good to stand together. Eric (Erlandson) and Courtney gifted us with the publishing of the music for the documentary; we could not have made it without that music. CNN: How would you describe your relationship with Love and the other band members? Schemel: We were still distant. I was not really in touch with everyone. In the process of the film, when we started shooting, I was still unsure as to whether I wanted to do the film. And then over time, things started to change. The more recovery I got, the less those sort of resentments were intense. Things started to dissolve towards everyone. [Love's] always been honest -- she was the one in the situation with ""Celebrity Skin"" and me being replaced with the studio guy. She was the one who did not surprise me -- she is honest about everything. And Eric and Melissa were the ones where I was like, ""what?"" I know her, and she is who she is, and I accept her exactly the way she is. With Eric (Erlandson), I have always enjoyed playing music with him and Melissa (Auf der Maur) as well. At the time they talk about their feelings about what happened -- and Melissa said she was concerned about her bass parts and what she was going to do. We became this business that was swallowed by the machine. What we started out as is so different from what we became. We were feminists, we had these things to say, then it became the opposite result. In my mind, I felt a bit of naivetÃ© in going along with it -- we're going there, we're doing it. Seeds were planted. CNN: What was it like to be in a band with Love, someone who Rolling Stone described as ""the most controversial woman in rock history""? Schemel: She is extremely smart and also angry and had her demons. She pretty much released it all on stage, and a lot of people related to that, and kids related to that, and women related to that. I wish I could tell everyone to ""f"" off like she does. That's what she meant to a lot of people. Also, this sort of fearlessness. CNN: Everyone thinks of Courtney Love when they think of Hole. But your peers say you were really the force behind the band. Did you even know that at the time? Schemel: No. Individually, I had my own thing going, my own demons to exorcise -- a girl, a drummer, all these things from my youth. I'm gay -- there was anger during that time for me. I made my way to punk rock -- I found that there are other freaks and weirdos like me. I wanted to prove myself as a drummer and as a female musician to my band and to the rest of the world. CNN: You had a very close relationship with Kurt Cobain, and the film features some personal scenes between you and him. What is the most important thing you would want people to know about him after all this time? Schemel: In outing that footage, it was a lot. He and I were friends before I joined Hole. He was a special person. He introduced me to Courtney to play in Hole. In the footage, he was the guy who loves his baby and his wife. And that's what I wanted to show -- just that. Not anything else. CNN: What do you want people to learn from ""Hit So Hard""? Schemel: With the film, I like the dialogue it starts about addiction. There's always a good dialogue with the audience about addiction -- what it is, and, is that why I started using drugs, because i was in Hole? I have something inside my DNA that makes me choose drugs as a solution instead of anything else. Also, the fact that it does get better, to quote that phrase. It does. I found my way being a gay woman and eventually got married and had a baby. I feel so grateful to play music for a living, but eventually found more about me than just doing that. I'm not just a drummer, I am a lot more than that. CNN: What are your thoughts on women in music, especially in the rock genres, today? Who do you look up to? And who do you think are the ""ones to watch""? Schemel: I really like ""Tegan and Sara"" as songwriters. What they do is great. Their music is amazing, and they write their songs. Neko Case, she is an amazing singer and songwriter. There's a band called, Best Coast. Those are my favorites right now. CNN: What are some of your favorite bands? And what are the top albums that rock your world? Schemel: ""Led Zeppelin III"" was a huge one, and ""Physical Graffiti"" is another great one. The soundtrack of my life during the '90s is My Bloody Valentine's ""Loveless."" Anything by Yo La Tengo. Beatles' ""Revolver"" -- huge. ""Minor Threat"" -- so important. CNN: What is a unique or surprising fact that most people do not know about you? Schemel: I enjoy napping a lot -- naps are important. I just got excited about reading, and I'm 44. I love reading (laughs).","Patty Schemel is starring in ""Hit So Hard,"" a documentary about her life .

"(CNN) -- When Barack Obama took office in 2009, it was clear that if he could do four big things, his presidency would probably be judged a success. The first, of course, was to pull the country out of its desperate economic crisis. The second was to extricate it from the Iraq War. The third was to finally achieve comprehensive health care reform. And the fourth was to make meaningful progress on arresting global warming. This last challenge was in some ways easiest to ignore: While you were shoveling snow last month, you probably didn't feel the urgency of climate change, though according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it was in fact the fourth-hottest January since record-keeping began. But over time, it could prove more consequential than the other three combined. Five years later, Obama's record on it is a mixed one. He won't get any significant legislation on the matter passed through this Congress -- or any legislation at all, to be honest. But using the power of the presidency, he may just have a bigger impact on global warming than most anyone predicted. That's the good news. The bad news is, it almost certainly won't be enough. It's easy to forget how the political environment has changed compared with just a few years ago. Before Obama took office, it looked as though Democrats and Republicans might work together to do something about climate change. Sen. John McCain had sponsored a bill to create a cap and trade system for carbon emissions, which at the time was considered a conservative solution to the problem, as it utilized market forces to control emissions. Many other prominent Republicans supported cap and trade as well. In 2008, Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi starred together in an ad imploring the country to address climate change. Yet today, opposition to doing anything about climate change has become the default Republican position. Even though many rank-and-file Republicans understand that the planet is warming, the tea party view has come to dominate their party. Climate denialism approaches the status of gospel truth among many Republicans in Congress, and it's echoed regularly on the major conservative media outlets, from Fox News to the most popular talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. As hatred of Obama and anything he touches has become the single highest Republican value, there is zero chance that they will join in any effort to address climate change. This has left the administration with two choices: do nothing or use the executive branch's regulatory power to reduce carbon emissions wherever it could. It chose the second path. The administration's latest move, which the President announced Tuesday, is a new measure mandating an increase in fuel efficiency for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which account for 20% of carbon emissions from transportation despite making up only 4% of all vehicles on the road. This follows on a truly historic regulation the administration created in 2012, which will double fuel efficiency for passenger cars by 2025, to an average of 54.5 miles per gallon. And few people remember how much the 2009 stimulus bill focused on climate change. Time magazine's Michael Grunwald, who wrote a book about the bill, argues that it was the largest green initiative in American history, pouring $90 billion into clean energy technologies, energy efficiency, upgrades to the electrical grid and a whole host of other efforts that could have a significant impact on carbon emissions over time. In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency officially made it policy to treat carbon emissions as a danger to human health and thus subject to its regulation. This January, the EPA published emission standards for new power plants that make it all but impossible for coal plants to be built (even though few coal plants were planned, given the recent natural gas boom). Its next task is to set new limits for the existing power plants that account for so much of our emissions. Finally, it's clear that climate change will play a significant role in the administration's foreign policy efforts during Obama's second term. Secretary of State John Kerry has long been an advocate for action, and as he told an audience in Indonesia, climate change is a threat as great as terrorism, poverty or weapons proliferation. American efforts to reduce emissions will be for naught if other countries don't take action as well -- China passed the U.S. a few years ago to become the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and continues to build coal plants at a furious pace -- and Kerry's tenure will be judged in no small part by how much progress he can make in this area. That all sounds like relatively good news. The administration has worked on many fronts to reduce carbon emissions, which have declined in three out of the five years Obama has been in office. That's in part due to the fracking boom that has made natural gas competitive with coal, but many of the administration's steps could yield significant long-term benefits. Even so, these measures will get us only a fraction of the distance we need to go in order to make a real impact on climate change. Ask a climate scientist, and you'll get a depressing take on our future, where things like moving from coal to natural gas do only the tiniest bit to delay what could be catastrophic consequences of climate change in decades to come. NOAA has also noted that 2013 tied for the fourth-hottest year on record. So we can give Obama credit for what he's done, and he should certainly keep trying to do more, even in the face of unceasing opposition from Republicans and well-heeled interest groups. Politics, as the old saying has it, is the art of the possible. Truly fixing the problem in a comprehensive way, given our current political environment, may never have been possible. Years from now, we're likely to look back and say that Obama gave it a good shot. But it wasn't nearly enough. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman says Obama won't get climate change legislation through Congress .
Opposition to anything on the issue has become default GOP position, he says .

"London, UK (CNN) -- Alina Cojocaru had been one of the Royal Ballet's biggest draws for half a decade by the time her career crashed to a halt. The minute Prima Ballerina -- praised as ""a dancer of seeming fragility, delicacy and radiance"" by The New York Times -- was rehearsing in 2008, when she was flipped by her partner, skewed awkwardly and slammed to earth. She suffered severe whiplash and a prolapsed disc in her spine and was forced to rest for over a year. At 25, doctors told her she would need surgery, and would never dance at the highest level again. The battle . Behind ballet's graceful pirouettes are grueling feats of training and endurance that push dancer's bodies to their extremes. Rest is a rare luxury. Some dancers perform 200 to 250 days a year, leaving just over 100 days to train and recover. Rehearsals can require 10 hours a day on the floor. It is hardly surprising that critics often refer to dancers -- especially the hard-worked young apprentices in the corps -- as the ""foot soldiers"" of ballet. Four out of five will suffer a severe injury during the course of their dancing career -- and two out of those four will never fully recover. Injuries, more often than not, are the result of fatigue and repeated strain on muscles and joints, rather than unpredictable accidents. Even in cases like Cojocaru's, fatigue can be the root of the disaster -- as one exhausted dancer's lapse in concentration often translates into another dancer's injury. Physiotherapy for recovering dancers is well entrenched -- and organizations such as the National Institute of Dance Medicine and Science and the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science have done a lot to advance knowledge of health issues among the big ballet companies and schools that feed them. But, beyond that, dancers benefit from few of the scientific breakthroughs that have so improved the safety record of their athletic counterparts on the sports field. Ballet science . Patrick Rump is the 33-year-old former karate champion fighting to change all that. Rump -- a broad-chested, broadly smiling German -- is the subject of ""Dance, Sports Science and Patrick Rump,"" a new short documentary produced by Lady Bernstein and directed by Nigel Wattis. First screened at the Prix de Lausanne ballet competition in February, in the film Rump buzzes with enthusiasm as he documents his work rehabilitating leading dancers -- including world-famous principals Mathias Heymann and Federico Bonelli, and the English National Ballet's artistic director Tamara Rojo -- and his light-handed attempts to start a revolution in dance health. The Rump approach is to consider the whole picture -- compiling data to track everything: from what the dancer eats and how much weight they can lift, to the angle of their leg as they glide through the air. ""It's actually sports sciences,"" he says, emphasizing the plural. ""It's, for example: biomechanics, which is kind of like physics for the body. It's anatomy, physiology. It's about training science, movement and exercise science, psychology, nutrition..."" he goes on. In practice, this means watching each dancer intimately and building a computer profile of their performance based on multitude of different measures. A dancer might be videoed as he or she prepares to leap -- recorded in slow motion, with two lasers beaming data back to a laptop on height jumped, time taken to get off the ground, and more. When Rump opens up his laptop screen, grid-squares line up with a young dancer's arrow-straight right leg, and betray a miniature kink in the left. The data readouts show he is jumping 5cm less than he was before injury. Rump takes this visual micro-analysis and adds dietary guidance, strength and stamina-building weight training, and scheduled recovery periods, all of which he imported from his knowledge of the world of sport. This way, he begins to build a personalized regime capable of restoring dancers from injury, and -- he hopes -- keeping them healthy when they recover. Resistance . When asked if his methods have face resistance from those in the ballet world, his usual smiling face drops momentarily, and he exhales: . ""Yeah, a lot."" He's used to hearing the complaint from ballet company directors that (he recalls) ""they are sports and we are art, and it doesn't go together."" Ballet instructors are often reluctant to see their dancers head into the weight room fearing that they will develop bulging muscles and lose the characteristically spindly look, traditionally considered ideal. And it has been harder still to break the ingrained code of silence that exists among dancers -- where fierce competition ensures they often conceal injury or weakness for fear of missing out on the best roles. ""At first, they thought we were the enemy!"" says Rump with a chuckle. ""This part where we said: 'Let's have regular tests, where we can clearly see: okay, is there something wrong? Is there weakness? Is there an imbalance between left and right, for example?' ""That scared them a lot...,"" he says, adding that many feared he would feed information back to directors about dancers' hidden frailties. ""You ask them about nutrition -- and in ballet there are problems with eating disorders -- and people get very scared and say 'I don't want to tell you about that.' ""They are not used to that process, because for years it has been [kept] very, very quiet. "" Results . When Rump was recruited to work with Alina Cojocaru, he set about providing a speedy response to critics' fears. Knowing nothing about the dancer, he searched YouTube for videos: . ""Just on what I saw on the video, I asked her a few questions and asked her 'Could it be that there's an underlying problem here and there,"" he says, pointing to two spots. ""Nobody I ever told that, [nobody] knew!"" she said. ""I've had that for quite a while and I tried to cover it."" Guided by Rump, Cojocaru recovered from surgery and addressed the underlying issues -- defying doctors' predictions and returning to the stage within six months. Of her comeback performance, the New York Times wrote: ""Ms. Cojocaru's ""Giselle"" was one of the great dance renditions of our time..."" By this point, many of the big companies were won over -- with the Forsythe Company, Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, and others leading the way. Rump now plans to spread his approach from ballet companies, to dance schools and beyond by compiling GJUUM -- a diverse team of sports scientists who will offer his all-round approach. As Cojocaru testifies, it will be a move welcomed by dancers: . ""To be on stage and not feel pain... it's a wonderful, wonderful miracle,"" she says. ""The enjoyment of dancers is going to be so much higher -- and the competition for me will be so much bigger!""","Ballet dancers fight through pain to perfect their art, and are often seriously injured .

"(CNN) -- The year was 1937. It was the dawn of the soft-drink machine, the first tube of the Lincoln Tunnel ... and the shopping cart. Inventor Sylvan Goldman's prototype for the shopping cart was nothing more than two wire baskets attached to a folding chair, but it was the start of what would become a supermarket staple. When it first came on the scene, customers were reluctant to use the cart. But by the 1960s, they were so ubiquitous that a new problem had arisen: . The rogue shopping cart. Chicago supermarket owner Anthony Dinolfo was so enraged by the volume of stolen shopping carts popping up in places decidedly not supermarkets (in auto repair shops, people's basements and at the bottom of rivers) that he went on a crusade to return them to their rightful owners. In 1969, he deemed February Return Shopping Carts to the Supermarket Month. Dinolfo died in 2009, but his crusade reappears each February on various websites and Internet forums, and was even acknowledged by the U.S. Census Bureau. When we brought this to the attention of the CNN iReport community, our contributors mentioned that until now, they had never noticed how prevalent wayward shopping carts were. While it may be easy to write off Dinolfo's crusade as just the hysterical rant of a disgruntled business owner, retailers report cart theft to be a costly problem. Shopping carts cost anywhere from $75 to $150 each, according to Brett Osterfeld of Gatekeeper systems. Retailers find customers' ambivalence toward the issue frustrating, but most people can't help but think that there are greater causes to raise awareness about. ""Am I supposed to really feel sorry for the grocers?"" asked Jeremy Nix from Denver. The great cart robbery . Ron Fong, president and CEO of the California Grocers Association, found that stores that report the greatest losses are located in neighborhoods and cities where few people own a car, but still need an efficient way to carry their groceries home. Once the shoppers are finished, the carts rarely return to the store. Fong said that he's seen many innovative uses for shopping carts, such as portable barbecue grills, lounge chairs and even shelters. He noted that many homeless people use them to transport their belongings. In November, Hawaii state lawmaker Tom Brower attempted to clean up the state's homeless problem by taking a sledgehammer to abandoned shopping carts. Hawaii has the country's highest rate of homeless per capita; Brewer said his solution was meant to encourage them to seek out shelters. ""I get a lot of complaints about stolen and abandoned shopping carts in Waikiki, and I was thinking as a public servant, 'What can I do that would be practical and I can literally do overnight?' "" Brower told CNN affiliate KITV. ""I'm not doing anything different than doing a community cleanup, or what the city's administration has tried to do with the issue of people illegally camping on the streets."" Supermarkets and community members aren't the only ones upset about the stray carts. The city of Santa Ana, California, reported an annual cost of $50,000 to retrieve abandoned shopping carts from local streams and rivers. Across the country, John Long, president of the Maryland nonprofit Clean Bread and Cheese Creek, said that volunteers have removed more than 200 shopping carts from the creek that drains into the Chesapeake Bay since 2009. ""They create an environmental hazard by trapping wildlife and causing artificial dams along the stream, which lead to flooding and erosion,"" Long said. Stores are working to contain the problem through the use of cart containment systems -- the wheels lock when they reach the boundary of the store's parking lot -- and by hiring companies to locate and return the carts for a fee. And yet, it's not hard to find plenty of shopping carts in the wild ...

"(CNN) -- An explosion killed at least 21 militants in Iraq Monday, apparently when a lesson on car bombing went wrong, police said. Police said they found a camera inside a house where the blast took place, leading them to believe someone was filming the installation of explosives into a vehicle for propaganda purposes. After a loud explosion, security officials rushed to the scene and found body parts, mostly of young men, scattered about. Six people were critically injured. Security forces arrested four men fleeing. Police said they believe the house was a small training base for the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). They also found documents and flags usually used by al Qaeda-linked groups such as ISIS. The explosion happened inside a remote house northeast of Samarra, a predominantly Sunni town about 110 kilometers (about 68 miles) north of Baghdad. Separately, shootings and explosions across the country killed at least 14 people and wounded 29 others, police officials in Baghdad, Mosul and Ramadi told CNN.","Authorities found a camera inside the house .

"(CNN) -- Attention passengers: United Airlines is cracking down on travelers with oversized carry-on luggage. The airline says it is motivated not by money -- the airline charges $25 for checked luggage -- but by complaints that some passengers are hogging space in the overhead bins. To address those gripes, United recently e-mailed frequent fliers reminding them of the size restrictions for carry-ons. And employees were told to keep an eye out for large carry-on bags. ""This is solely about ensuring the greatest number of customers with standard-sized carry-ons are able to store them onboard,"" a spokesman said. The airline stressed it is not changing its policy but is trying to more strictly enforce it. If your bag doesn't fit in the bag measure at the security line, be prepared to be directed back to the ticket counter to check the bag for a $25 bag fee. Passengers who get through the security checkpoint with an oversized bag will not be sent back to the ticket counter, a spokesman said. Instead, the bag will be gate-checked for free. Even if your large carry-on could technically be squeezed into the bin, United said it takes away space from other customers if it's not within the size restrictions (9 x 14 x 22 inches, including handles and wheels.) The airline retrofitted 152 airbus planes with larger bins. They say their newer planes acquired in the past 10 years also have larger bins. Oversized carry-ons is a frequent problem on domestic flights and less so on international flights, since most international fliers headed to a destination for a longer period usually check luggage.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A former New Orleans police lieutenant pleaded guilty Wednesday to obstruction of justice in connection with the police shootings of civilians in the days after Hurricane Katrina and court documents unsealed with the plea suggest that other officers will be indicted in the case. Former Lt. Michael Lohman was convicted of ""conspiring with a group of New Orleans police officers to obstruct justice by engaging in a cover-up of the true circumstances surrounding the shooting, by NOPD officers, of a number of individuals,"" U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana said at a news conference. Two civilians were killed and four were wounded in the shootings on the Danziger Bridge on September 4, 2005, days after Hurricane Katrina roared ashore on the Gulf Coast. Read the criminal complaint . The guilty plea does not signal the end of the investigation into the incident, Letten said. ""Know this: the investigation continues,"" he said, adding that ""this investigation is being conducted very aggressively, but also very fairly."" The federal indictment unsealed Wednesday signaled that other indictments are likely. ""[T]he incident involved at least seven NOPD officers who drove to the Danziger Bridge in a rental truck in response to a call for police assistance,"" the indictment said. CNN New Orleans affiliate WVUE reported that two other officers have received target letters from federal prosecutors. Such letters are sent to targets of grand jury investigations. Legal scholars said they expected more indictments in the cover-up of the shooting but that it's unclear whether any officers will be charged for the shooting itself. ""There's no evidence the officers shot out of malice,"" said Dane Ciolino, a professor at Loyola University New Orleans' College of Law. ""It was probably negligence, ratcheted up to a federal offense by the cover-up."" Lohman, the officer who pleaded guilty Wednesday, conspired with other police officers to cover up the shootings even though he believed them to be ""legally unjustified,"" according to the federal indictment. Among Lohman's actions, he fabricated stories, statements, a 17-page report and a follow-up report, and lied to federal agents, Letten said. The shootings occurred after several officers, responding to a call for assistance, drove to the bridge and encountered six civilians who were walking across it to get food and supplies, the indictment says. The officers fired, killing one person -- later identified as 19-year-old James Brissette -- and wounding four others, according to the indictment. Witness in 2006: New Orleans cops shot man in back . Once they reached the other side of the bridge, the officers started shooting again, killing Ronald Madison, a 40-year-old severely disabled man, the indictment says. Madison was shot seven times -- five times in the back, the coroner has said. Lohman arrived on the scene after the shooting, learned that his police colleagues ""planned to provide false stories about what had precipitated the shooting"" and ""encouraged them to do so,"" according to the indictment. Among other things, Lohman did not ensure police collected evidence, suggested that colleagues get rid of some shell casings the shooters had left behind and went along with a plan to plant a gun near the bridge, according to the indictment. The officers falsely arrested Madison's brother on eight counts of attempted murder of a police officer, according to the indictment. Lance Madison was held for weeks before being released without any formal charges filed against him. State prosecutors pursued criminal charges against several police officers without success. In August 2008, a judge quashed indictments against Sgts. Kenneth Bowen and Robert Gisevius Jr., Officer Anthony Villavaso II and former Officer Robert Faulcon Jr., all of whom were facing first-degree murder and attempted murder charges. In addition, he threw out attempted first-degree murder charges against Officers Mike Hunter Jr. and Robert Barrios, and attempted second-degree murder charges against Officer Ignatius Hills. Federal prosecutors opened an investigation after the judge's actions. The failure of the state prosecutors' strategy is another reason legal scholars say they expect the federal indictments to hinge on the cover-up instead of the shooting itself.","NEW: Federal indictment unsealed Wednesday signaled that other indictments are likely .

"(CNN) -- Since the U.S. Copyright Office declared last month that it's legal to jailbreak your iPhone, lots of iPhone users have been doing just that -- nearly 9 percent of them as of late July. But jailbreaking your iPhone -- tweaking it to run applications not approved by Apple -- is serious business. That's not just because jailbreaking can void your Apple warranty, but because it can put you at risk of data theft, malware or other significant problems. In November, TUAW reported that a Dutch hacker proved this point by using port scanning -- using software to probe a network host for open ports -- to find jailbroken phones. From there, he sent unsuspecting users a message that read, 'Your iPhone's been hacked because it's really insecure! Right now, I can access all your files.' "" He then directed his victims to PayPal and requested €5 (about $10) in exchange for instructions to remove his hack. At least he let his victims know they'd been hacked. Your iPhone won't notify you about that on its own. If you jailbreak your iPhone, one crucial way to protect yourself is to change the phone's default passwords. But be forewarned: It's not a simple process. In the latest episode of the Boulder Open Podcast, hosts Dave Taylor and Michael Sitarzewski discussed this concern. Recently both of them jailbroke their iPhone 4s. ""I've gotta say, this was not a compelling experience. It was complicated as heck to figure out how to jailbreak the phone and then change the default passwords,"" said Taylor, a longtime tech expert. ""Once you jailbreak your phone, it's accessible via laptops. Someone can log into your phone and monkey with it. The process for changing the passwords is really quite a production. Like a lot of the open-source technology I've used in past 30 years, this is not something you want to get involved with unless you're willing to spend the time to learn how to do this safely."" A ""root password"" is a fundamental part of the geeky Unix back-end of the iPhone's slick operating system. It's something that non-jailbroken users never have to worry about because Apple's walled-garden iPhone experience prevents this particular kind of incursion. Sitarzewski explained, ""Every Unix system on the planet has a root account, and the default password for that account is the same on every iPhone on the planet ('alpine'). ""When you jailbreak your phone, sometimes one of the requirements for an app is secure shell (SSH). That's the only way you're opening yourself up to this particular vulnerability. So you don't absolutely have to change your root password if you don't install SSH protocols -- but it's a good idea anyway."" Taylor added: ""Not only is the default root password the same on every iPhone, but the default mobile user account password also is the same on every iPhone ('dottie'). So you should change them both."" If you venture beyond Apple's iPhone garden walls, you can follow these instructions to change your default passwords from the Just Another iPhone Blog. Alternatively, TiPb offers instructions on using the JailbreakMe mobile site to simplify the jailbreaking process. They note that as of early August, some jailbroken iPhone users running iOS4 reported problems with the terminal (a command-line interface that lets you access system-level functions), and pointed to a TiPb discussion forum for instructions on fixing that problem.","If you jailbreak your iPhone, it is more susceptible to hackers .

"(CNN) -- World leaders and world markets have been weighing in forcefully about what's happening in Crimea. It's clear how U.S. officials feel (they're outraged) about Russia's military activities in Ukraine's Crimea region and along the border between the two neighbors. Here's what others are saying or doing: . China . A neighbor and often an ally of Russia, China is distancing itself from Russia's troop movements. ""It is China's long-standing position not to interfere in others' internal affairs,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang said. ""We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."" At the same time, Qin suggested that Ukraine isn't completely faultless. ""There are reasons for why the situation in Ukraine is what it is today,"" Qin said. Qin didn't elaborate on that point, but earlier in his statement, Qin spoke of Ukraine and said China condemns ""the recent extreme and violent acts there and have been urging the relevant parties in Ukraine to resolve their internal disputes peacefully within the legal framework so as to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of all ethnic communities in Ukraine and restore normal social order at an early date."" World markets . Earlier this week, the world's investment leaders sent global markets into nosedive out of fears of a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Traders dumped the Russian currency, sending the ruble down more than 10% so far this year. But on Tuesday, when Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country won't make a claim to Crimea, global markets rebounded, the ruble improved, and Russia's main stock index, the Micex, rose 6% after falling 11% a day earlier. ""There has been a distinct change in the tone of the markets today as the Russian-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. The latest headlines suggest that Putin has had a change of heart,"" Kathleen Brooks, a research director at FOREX.com, told CNN Money. ""Putin is still trying to save some face after this situation dramatically backfired on him."" But the crisis remains a concern to the world markets. ""The situation in Ukraine is far from off the radar and remains a potent wild card,"" said Ilya Spivak, a currency strategist at DailyFX. ""Deeper escalation of tensions remains a clear possibility."" Germany . Chancellor Angela Merkel was so concerned about the rising tension in the Crimean peninsula that she and Putin held a conversation, and in it, she proposed a ""fact-finding mission"" to Ukraine and a political dialogue. Putin accepted. The mission may be carried out under the leadership of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), according to statement from the chancellor's office. On Tuesday, the German publication Spiegel Online portrayed Germany as ""playing a central role in communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But the international community has doubts that Chancellor Angela Merkel can pull it off,"" the news outlet said. Spiegel quoted Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier as saying that ""Europe is, without a doubt, in its most serious crisis since the fall of the Berlin Wall. ""Twenty-five years after the end of the conflict between the blocs, there's a new, real danger that Europe will split once again,"" Steinmeier said, according to Spiegel. European Union . European nations at Monday's meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council have called upon Russia to stand down in the Crimea and return its forces immediately ""to the areas of their permanent stationing,"" U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday. The European Union will take up the crisis at a meeting Thursday and ""will decide about consequences for relations between the EU and Russia -- such as suspending bilateral talks with Russia on visa matters, and considering targeted measures"" -- if Russia doesn't begin ""de-escalating steps,"" Hague said. British Prime Minister David Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama are of like mind about Russia's military exercises in relation to Ukraine: ""There must be significant costs to Russia if it does not change course on Ukraine,"" Hague said. The UK government has ""condemned Russia's military intervention in Ukraine and warned against any further escalation,"" Hague added. Ulrich Speck, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Europe think tank in Brussels, contended in a CNN Opinion column that Putin is trying to build an empire that Speck labeled a ""Soviet Union lite"" -- ""a ring of countries under Moscow's control, with the goal of boosting Russia's geopolitical standing,"" Speck wrote. ""Ukraine is the cornerstone of that project,"" Speck argued. CNN Money's Sophia Yan and Alanna Petroff contributed to this report.","China distances itself from Russia's troop movements, hints Ukraine isn't faultless .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't until December 6 that Latinos could access CuidadoDeSalud.gov -- the extremely delayed and poorly translated Spanish version of HealthCare.gov. The thrown-together Spanish website has been a thorn in the President's side with the Latino community. It's no surprise that support for Obamacare has waned among Latinos. A Pew Research poll found that last year disapproval of Obamacare among Hispanics increased 11 points from September 2013 to December 2013. The White House is worried. Not enough Americans are signing up for Democrats' misguided health care law. And that means more problems -- most notably higher costs -- could be on the horizon. So the administration is scrambling in the final three weeks of the enrollment period to sign up enough people to make the health care law work. Yet the White House is ignoring an inconvenient truth: Obamacare is hurting far too many of our friends and neighbors in the Latino community. The problems go far beyond the demeaning and sloppy cuidadodesalud.gov. One of the biggest fears the White House has is the low enrollment of millennials. Sixty-five percent of Latinos in this country are 22 to 35 years old, they are key to the success of Obamacare. If enough of them don't sign up for insurance plans, individuals may expect to face higher average costs. But millennials say they aren't signing up because coverage is unaffordable -- or doesn't make sense for them. Fusion, a new English-language Latino TV network, illustrated the trouble with the health care law when they interviewed a 28-year-old Obama supporter who says he won't sign up for coverage because ""he'd rather spend the money on his business, rather than spend it on insurance he says won't even help him that much."" Besides the affordability and enrollment problems for young people, our abuelos -- grandparents -- will be hurt by the new health care law as well. Due to Medicare reductions under Obamacare, Medicare Advantage is being cut. The National Medical Hispanic Association has called the payment cuts ""disturbing"" -- and rightfully so. Thirty-eight percent of Latinos with incomes of $20,000 or less enrolled in Medicare Advantage may face higher fees and fewer benefits. But the pain for our community doesn't end there. Across the country, Obamacare is bound to take a toll on some of the 2.3 million Hispanic-owned businesses and 1.9 million workers they help employ. The law has made it harder for businesses to hire more workers, and full-time workers have seen their hours reduced to part-time. Ruben Rivas, owner of a small business called H2Only Renewable Cleaning, told Telemundo, ""There is no way we can pay or provide employees their health insurance, because there is no margin. If I do that, I have to close the doors -- then no one is going to work. Unfortunately, we are trying to convert our employees from eight hours to 5.5 hours (daily) as stated in the new law."" Hispanics came to this country in search of the promise of individual freedom and opportunity, but Obamacare is undermining that promise. We do not need special sign-up programs or false assurances. We need real health care reform that actually expands access and lowers costs -- not ""reform"" that makes life more expensive. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- Condemned serial murderer Richard Ramirez, known as the ""Night Stalker"" to the Californians he terrorized in the 1980s, died of cancer, according to coroner's findings released Monday. Ramirez had been sentenced to death for 13 murders, five attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults and 14 burglaries in the spring and summer of 1985. He died earlier this month of complications from B-cell lymphoma in a hospital in Marin County, outside San Francisco, at age 53, the county sheriff's department reported. A self-professed Satan worshiper who inflicted physical and emotional pain on his victims in myriad ways, Ramirez told the court that sentenced him to death, ""I am beyond good and evil. I will be avenged. Lucifer dwells in us all."" He died on June 7, the 59th California inmate to die of natural causes while awaiting execution. Most of his victims were in Southern California, though two of those killed were in the San Francisco area. He was arrested after residents of an east Los Angeles neighborhood spotted him trying to steal two cars, caught and subdued him, then held him down until police arrived. The rest of his life was spent at the home for many of California's most dangerous felons, San Quentin State Prison, which sits like a fortress along the bay just north of San Francisco.","Serial killer Richard Ramirez died of lymphoma, coroner finds .

"(CNN) -- Who was the real Charles M. Schulz? Was he the man who suffered anxiety attacks, remembered slights for decades and put every ounce of existential angst into his comic strip, ""Peanuts""? Was he the grandfatherly cartoonist hailed as a towering figure in American popular culture, who revolutionized the comic strip and created not only a multimillion-dollar business, but a daily touchstone for fans worldwide? Or was he between the lines in ""Peanuts"" itself, in the melancholy of Charlie Brown, the exuberance of Snoopy, the intellectualism of Linus, the directness of Lucy and the bafflement of Peppermint Patty? Biographer David Michaelis was intrigued by the seeming divide between the popular image of Schulz -- one the cartoonist fostered in interviews and talk-show appearances -- and the depth of emotion manifested in the comic strip. ""I thought there had to be more,"" he says in a phone interview from his home in New York. ""[He said] things about himself in a self-deprecating way, with such a sense of humor ... but behind so much of it was a real guy who had placed himself in the characters of 'Peanuts.' There was a certain amount of biographical ore to be mined."" The result of Michaelis' digging, ""Schulz and Peanuts"" (Harper), appears Tuesday. The book has received mostly glowing reviews, though Schulz's family -- who agreed to interviews and gave the biographer access to papers -- has been sharply critical of the book's warts-and-all presentation. ""The whole thing is completely wrong,"" Schulz's daughter, Amy Schulz Johnson, told The New York Times. ""I think [Michaelis] wanted to write a book a certain way, and so he used our family."" Added Schulz's son, Monte: ""It's preposterous."" Michaelis defends the final work. ""This was the man I found,"" he told The Times. Certainly, ""Schulz and Peanuts"" has its share of surprises. Michaelis draws parallels between Schulz's sometimes contentious first marriage and the relationship between Charlie Brown and Lucy, as well as how romantic affairs and fantasies emerged in the strip. (Cleverly, the book's text is interspersed with hundreds of ""Peanuts"" strips that function as a kind of Greek chorus.) He observes that a number of character names -- Shermy, Linus, even Charlie Brown -- had real-life roots. And he goes into Schulz's dark places, from his fear of travel to the death of his mother. Schulz's personality was established early on. The Minneapolis, Minnesota-born cartoonist, the son of a barber, was a neat, reserved, anxious ""good boy"" as a child. He drew constantly -- his first success was a sketch of his dog that was reprinted in ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" -- but remained lonely and standoffish through his adolescence, terrified of girls, his work dismissed by his high school yearbook in a long-remembered snub. As Michaelis observes, service in World War II hardened and matured the young artist, but Schulz never lost his childhood attributes. His sense of loss was deepened by the death of his mother not long after he joined the Army. Later, he underwent a painful midlife divorce. Schulz once characterized ""Peanuts"" -- Snoopy's fantasy life notwithstanding -- as a study in disappointment. ""All the loves in the strip are unrequited; all the baseball games are lost; all the test scores are D-minuses; the Great Pumpkin never comes; and the football is always pulled away,"" he said. But if disappointment were all there was to ""Peanuts,"" the strip never would have had such success, says Michaelis. ""Charlie Brown has to carry Charles Schulz's spears, and the slings and arrows of the world,"" he said. ""But I think Schulz found something in his own character early on, which was fortitude -- which was the single quality he gave to Charlie Brown. ... It's his fortitude, his endurance, his willingness to do all this without self-pity that makes us love him and admire him."" ""Peanuts"" also changed comic strips as we know them, exploiting minimalist lines and existential depth in a way few strips had even attempted, much less in a day-to-day fashion, says ""Pearls Before Swine"" cartoonist Stephan Pastis. ""He pretty much invented the modern comic strip,"" he says. Pastis compares Schulz's impact to that of Marlon Brando in film: ""Before Brando, you had one style of film acting, and after, you had another. Schulz did that in the comic strip."" (Pastis, who considers Schulz a hero, now gets to work under his spiritual wing as a member of the board of the Charles M. Schulz Museum.) Moreover, despite his aw-shucks manner, Schulz was also a shrewd businessman. ""Peanuts"" spawned a hit musical (""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown""), at least one hit song (the Royal Guardsmen's ""Snoopy vs. the Red Baron""), fronted for advertising campaigns, was featured in countless TV specials and generated an empire of commercial goods. When his work was threatened, Schulz stood his ground. CBS was uncomfortable with the Bible verses and jazz music of ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" but it went on just as planned. Schulz also maintained a keen sense of competition. Though always eager to help young cartoonists, he also liked to show them not to underestimate the old man. ""When I told him that I was in 2,000 papers, he said 'I'll see you in the Louvre,' "" ""For Better or For Worse"" cartoonist Lynn Johnston told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. ""He was very competitive -- and he was right! He was the only one of us in the Louvre, and I'll never get there."" ""Peanuts"" remained the heart of Schulz's life literally right up until the end. The cartoonist died of cancer on February 12, 2000, the day before his final Sunday strip ran. In the end, Schulz's gift was to expand the world of the comic strip -- and, thereby, expand the world of his readers, Michaelis says. ""He kept saying this: There was complexity in the world,"" Michaelis says. ""And people who knew him kept saying there was complexity in his personality. ... The thing that 'Peanuts' taught us is that contradiction and ambiguity is as much a part of life as sweetness and happiness -- and to see Charles Schulz as any one thing and not another is to deprive him of being the man and the genius he really was.""

"(CNN) -- Whenever I visit Washington, I can't help but think this is the town that elected a crackhead as its mayor. I know, I know it's not PC to say, but just because it's insensitive doesn't mean it isn't true. But think about this: There is footage of Marion Barry in a room of crack smoke saying, ""Bitch set me up."" And yet that image, that video did not disqualify him from being seen as a viable political option in the mind of voters. In fact, not only was he re-elected mayor after serving time in a federal prison, today he sits on the City Council, all because he managed to convince enough black people that the video of him with the crack pipe in his mouth was white people's fault. When analyzing what is wrong with our government, allow me to present this example as Exhibit A. Exhibit B would be Newt Gingrich, who cheated on two wives and is the only speaker of the House to have been disciplined for ethics violations. And yet somehow he is running for president of the United States as a religious conservative and managed to get 8% of the votes during last week's straw poll in Florida. Are you freaking kidding me? The fact that he is even on camera discussing the country's sense of morality during the GOP debates should be offensive to any thinking person regardless of party affiliation. And yet someone, right now, is thinking about sending his campaign a check. And who can forget Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who last year, in trying to push a controversial immigration law, said law enforcement officials found headless bodies in the desert, the work of a Mexican cartel. But she was forced to admit that wasn't true, that she had ""misspoke."" What she didn't speak about was her close ties to the private prisons that were set to profit because of the new law. Ties like her campaign manager and her spokesman being former lobbyists for private prison companies. And despite the obvious conflict of interest, she won easily, saying on election Tuesday, ""Tonight, the people have redeemed and renewed America."" Nice work, people. I could go on but I think you see what I'm getting at: The biggest reason government is broken is because of voters. Let's face it. A lot of us are just plain stupid. Or at the very least lazy. We want our candidates to use easy-to-digest buzz words such as ""family values"" or ""clean energy"" so we don't have to actually invest too much time thinking. We can just slip our brains into auto-pilot and cruise on into November. Do I believe our politicians need to be perfect? No. But damn, you would think people would draw the line at crack. Or blatant hypocrisy. Or just making stuff up as a candidate goes along. Each time Rep. Michele Bachmann insinuates falsehoods into her arguments, as she did earlier this month on the ""Today Show"" by suggesting HPV vaccinations cause mental retardation, I think: A group of people on auto-pilot in Minnesota did this to us. When you know important debates are influenced by people who don't like being bothered with facts, you question just how many of the country's problems over the years have been caused by people who should not have been involved in the process in the first place. But they are because of us. So can we genuinely complain about government without accepting a lot of the blame? I don't think so. After all, they didn't elect themselves. So if we want government to work, we have to be smarter about our choices. It's one thing to have a population with a variety of political sensibilities; it's another to be a country full of idiots. Too many times we vote and consequently govern like the latter. We have to move away from easy-to-repeat campaign slogans and promises of easy solutions, because we're a country with more than 300 million people, a complicated racial and religious history and the world's largest GDP. There are no easy solutions. So if you're the kind of person who likes to say ""I don't follow politics,"" let me remind you that no one lives in a vacuum and that sentiment epitomizes what is wrong with our government. I don't blame Sarah Palin for thinking she can still toss her hat in the ring. I blame us voters for creating an environment in which a Palin or a Gingrich or even a reality TV star like Donald Trump can feel as if they can run and even be taken seriously. Last week I was bombarded with e-mails from readers who said Social Security should be protected because they paid into it, but they didn't care about Medicaid or Medicare because the government pays for those. And in 13 months some of these people will be voting for president. You want to know what's wrong with government? I just presented you with Exhibit C.

"(Parenting.com) -- For Texas-based mom Tamara*, the journey to motherhood was anything but easy. In 2003, after developing severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome (a life-threatening complication of preeclampsia), doctors had to deliver her daughter via emergency cesarean section at just 25 weeks into her pregnancy. She was born a micro-preemie, weighing a mere 1 pound, 4 ounces; Tamara was advised never to pursue another pregnancy, as she was given a 60 percent chance of developing the same complications. For the first two years of her life, Tamara kept her daughter at home much of the time, due to a host of medical problems and issues with her feeding and growth. It was only as of her daughter's second birthday that Tamara finally started to venture out to meet other moms and give her daughter a chance to meet other kids. Parenting.com: Husband creates food art for pregnant wife on bedrest . It was at that point, in 2005, that Tamara and her daughter met another mom, Logan, at their local public library during story time. Logan was there with her 2-year-old as well as a younger baby. The two women started to form a friendship. ""We all just became very, very close,"" says Tamara. ""It was a really special kind of relationship -- and it happened kind of randomly at the time."" As time went on and Tamara's daughter became healthier, she and her husband, Brent, longed for another child, but they knew that they couldn't risk a second pregnancy. After just a year into their friendship and hearing her friend talk about wanting to become a mother again, Logan made an offer that would ultimately change their friendship -- and both of their lives -- forever. She said, ""I'm good at pregnancy; I carry to full-term and have healthy kids. I would love to be a surrogate for you."" Although Tamara knew it was a genuine offer, she didn't know that she would ultimately take Logan up on it. Parenting.com: Milk sharing: ""I'm nursing another mom's baby"" A few years passed and the families continued to grow closer; their kids became best friends, and Brent and Logan's husband, Nathan, became friends. Tamara eventually approached Logan to ask if she was still serious about her offer. ""I asked her if she had meant what she said. The thing I was most concerned about at the time was how her husband would feel about it. Logan's a special, giving person that genuinely wants to help people, and we had become best friends. I asked her about how Nathan felt many, many, many times -- I didn't want to create any problems in their marriage and I wouldn't have pursued it if I thought it would cause any problems for them,"" said Tamara. But Nathan was supportive of pursuing surrogacy, asking, ""How often in life do you get to do something so big and so profound for someone else?"" Parenting.com: What labor's really like . When it seemed that both couples were onboard with the plan, Tamara, Brent, and Logan went to see a reproductive endocrinologist in January 2010. After months of fertility drugs for both women, they attempted their first embryo transfer (using Tamara's eggs and Brent's sperm). Although that initial attempt failed, their second transfer in late November of that year was a success. ""Our bun, her oven,"" says Tamara, with a laugh. Watching Logan go through a pregnancy with Tamara and Brent's baby inside of her felt, ""Weird. Different,"" says Tamara. ""Particularly for me because not only had I somewhat experienced pregnancy, but mine had been cut really short. In many ways, I was so excited and happy and joyful that we were expecting a child -- but on the flip side, I did sometimes feel a pang of -- not regret -- but just wishing that it could be me. I felt a little bit cheated out of the pregnancy experience. I know that some people may not understand that -- and I really am thankful, but I've also come to realize that it's normal to have these feelings."" Parenting.com: 16 early signs of pregnancy . By the time of the surrogacy, Logan had had a third child of her own, this time delivering at home, after two hospital births. Her homebirth experience had been so profound that it was actually a stipulation for her to do the surrogacy in the first place. Explains Tamara, ""As you can imagine for my husband and me, getting on board with a homebirth was difficult because we had really needed the medical support of a hospital. But once I became educated about homebirth and the more the pregnancy progressed, the more we relaxed. We trusted Logan and Nathan, and that they knew what they were doing. I felt strongly that it was going to be OK."" The families used the same midwives that had attended Logan's previous homebirth, Gentle Beginnings Birth Center. Says Tamara, ""They treated Logan and me as if we were both the clients."" Logan's labor was long and hard. She suffered through two days of labor, including painful prodromal labor. Of seeing her friend in labor, says Tamara, ""It was just surreal... She got to a certain point, and then it just stopped progressing. Brent and I tried not to worry too much, but at some point the midwives decided to send us home, as they thought that our presence might be creating some anxiety for Logan."" Although the families had planned for a different scenario (Logan and Tamara took a doula class together so that Tamara could serve as Logan's doula), Nathan ended up serving as Logan's primary support during the long labor. Tamara and Brent remained in contact with the midwives throughout, though, and were called back to Logan and Nathan's home once Logan was dilated to 8 centimeters. ""At that point, things progressed really quickly -- within an hour we had a baby,"" says Tamara. Parenting.com: Strange-but-true pregnancy and labor tales . During labor, ""I was in complete awe and was so proud of her. She was so strong -- because she's someone who was going through a lot of physical pain for someone else. I was really in awe of her strength -- and of birth itself. I remember I had my hand on Logan's knee, helping her to keep her legs apart, when I saw the baby start to crown. I had known there was a baby in there, but to actually see the baby coming out -- well, all that emotion on my face in the pictures is real,"" says Tamara. ""The labor was a bonding experience for all of us. It's one thing to go through the pregnancy, but this experience of coming together -- four people got together and we brought a child into this world. Everyone had to agree and be supportive of one another, and here she is."" The surrogacy has only brought the two best friends even closer. Although Tamara is breastfeeding after re-lactating (with the help of supplements and a breast pump starting months before the birth), Logan is also pumping for baby Josie because Tamara doesn't have a full supply of milk. Parenting.com: Top baby names of 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Federal accident investigators issued two ""urgent"" recommendations to the Chicago Transit Authority on Friday urging action to prevent another crash similar to one this week in which an unoccupied CTA train collided with another at a station, injuring 33 people. The National Transportation Safety Board told the authority in a letter that it needed to take steps, including using wheel chocks, to prevent trains from moving unintentionally. CTA said in response it had taken those and other steps immediately after the crash on Monday. The accident occurred when a four-car train -- unoccupied but powered up -- departed the Forest Park Repair Terminal where it was awaiting repairs. It traveled almost a mile downhill through five devices designed to stop trains, eventually colliding with an occupied train stopped at the Harlem Station on CTA's Blue Line. Some 33 passengers were injured. Those who were hospitalized have been released, authorities said. The empty train movement remains under investigation, but the CTA said neither criminal conduct nor vandalism is suspected. The safety board said unoccupied CTA trains are ""routinely left powered up"" while stored at the repair yard. But CTA spokesman Brian Steele disputed that, saying trains are typically powered up prior to going into service. Steele said preliminary indications show the train was powered up at the time of the incident, but it was unclear when it was scheduled to depart the repair yard to go to another maintenance yard. ""That's one of the questions we are trying to answer,"" he said. The NTSB said the investigation continues, noting that one of the cars had heat-damaged wiring and water in electrical connection boxes. Steele said the CTA has inspected about half of the 600 to 700 cars in its fleet without finding similar damage. The inspections were to be completed this weekend, he said. The NTSB typically rolls out recommendations at the conclusion of investigations, but can issue guidance earlier if it identifies a safety problem. In this case, it issued the recommendations while most of the agency was on furlough because of the government shutdown. The furlough rules allow for ongoing investigations in cases that are necessary to ""prevent the imminent potential for loss of life and significant property damage."" The NTSB also can launch investigations into ""major accidents involving significant casualties."" The actions recommended by the board need ""to be addressed expeditiously to prevent a recurrence,"" NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman wrote in the letter to Forrest Claypool, president of the CTA. In addition to wheel chocks, the NTSB recommended turning off propulsion power and using an alternative brake setting, and a system to derail cars before they enter the main track. The NTSB also wrote to the Federal Transit Administration requesting it issue a safety advisory to all transit systems asking them to review operating and maintenance procedures for stored, unoccupied cars. All but 28 of the FTA's 529 employees have been furloughed. An FTA spokeswoman said that the administration complied and issued the safety advisory.","Rail collision this week in Chicago injured 33 people .

"(CNN) -- In general, digestive diseases are hidden in the bathroom. You don't talk about anything that happens there unless it's with your spouse or a close friend. Being ashamed and scared, you tend to pull back and hide. Nobody wants to stand out on a corner and say, ""I've got an ostomy,"" myself included. I have an ostomy -- just like more than 500,000 people in the United States, according to the United Ostomy Associations of America. An ostomy is a surgically created opening in the body that allows for the external elimination of body waste. They call mine a colostomy because it involves my colon. There are many types of ostomies, such as those involving the bladder or the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). My path to this crossroads involved being diagnosed with Crohn's disease at the age of 17. The chronic disease left me doubled over in pain during flare-ups that sent me to the bathroom frequently for days. Some of the symptoms people experience are nausea, life-threatening bowel obstructions, incontinence, dehydration, intravenous feeding, fatigue and depression. Living with Crohn's disease: 'Today I will fight again' My illness was punctuated by multiple surgeries, hospitalizations and a body fighting to stay alive. I am thankful for the amazing doctors and nurses at UCLA who saved my life not once but twice. Six years ago, my Crohn's had gotten so bad, I had a temporary ostomy where my colon was reattached several months later. I remember my emotional status after that: I didn't want to leave the house. If my bag filled up, I didn't want to use a public restroom to change it. I found myself facing a permanent colostomy in 2010. I knew that I needed the procedure to save my life, but I was faced with the impending realization that my body and my life would change forever. FAQ: Adapting to life after an ostomy . I would no longer be able to hit the beach and take my shirt off without people staring or getting grossed out. Nor would I be able to sleep with my shirt off, because it would mean one less layer of protection against a leak. I was afraid to leave my house or even let anyone see my bag; I have even hidden it from my inquisitive 8-year-old daughter. I found myself trying to cover up noises and smells that I was convinced others always heard and smelled, although they rarely did. I knew that I had to make a choice between living my life in fear or meeting this new challenge head-on. Eventually, I came to a realization: I refused to be part of a stigma and go into hiding because of embarrassment. Now I am sharing my story in an effort to help educate the general population about ostomies. We need to start a national conversation about ostomies and let people know they are not alone. David Rudzin, president of the United Ostomy Associations of America, agrees. ""It would break the stigma and the silence, since no one talks about ostomy surgery. People consider it disfiguring and gross,"" he said. ""Ostomies, like mastectomies, save lives, period,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, all people focus on is crapping in a pouch."" Designs to disguise and emphasize external devices . You see, all of my fears 2Â½ years ago were for nothing. Besides my efforts to raise awareness, I have traveled, gone to the beach (my shirt stays on, though), swum freely in pools and oceans, and even gone ziplining. Having the ostomy has done nothing to impede my way of life. If anything, it has improved it. I am no longer living a life inside the bathroom. My mission now is to convince everyone to start the conversation about ostomies. Maybe then we can reach those people who feel lost and scared, educate the public about greater acceptance and, most important, raise awareness so that no one fears having an ostomy or knowing someone with one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Doug Yakich.","Doug Yakich has had Crohn's disease for more than 20 years .

"(CNN) -- A 10-year-old Afghan girl alleges that she was pressured to carry out a would-be suicide bombing on a border police station in the southern Helmand province, officials said. There were conflicting reports about how the plot was foiled, but the fact that a young girl was caught up in the middle of it was shocking enough for President Hamid Karzai to quickly condemn the alleged attackers. ""Children are the future-makers of the country. They should be taken care of, and education opportunities should be provided for them,"" he said in a statement. ""They shouldn't be used as a tool for suicide attacks."" Afghan and foreign forces have arrested many would-be suicide bomber children. Last year, Afghan police intercepted 41 children whom insurgents were planning to use as suicide bombers. They were between 6 and 11 years old. According to Karzai, the girl, known only as Spozhmai, was forced to attempt the suicide attack and is now under the government's protection. The girl's brother, Zahir, is known locally as Hameed Sahib and is a local Taliban commander, the country's Interior Ministry said. The girl spoke with police and reporters, giving slightly different versions of what the alleged attack plans entailed. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry provided what he said was the definitive version, based on the investigation. Spozhmai's brother and a friend forced her to attempt a suicide attack on the police station, spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. They took her to a river near the police station and gave her a suicide vest and second pair of clothes to change into once she crossed, Sediqqi said. Her instructions were to cross the river, spend the night in an abandoned house and approach the police station in the morning as the officers prepared for their daily patrols, the Interior Ministry spokesman said. Upon entering the water, however, Spozhmai felt cold and started screaming, Sediqqi said. Police officers heard the screams and ran to the river, he said. At the sight of the police, the brother took the suicide vest and fled, he said. The officers took the girl to their station, where she opened up with her story, Sediqqi said. When taken into custody, the girl was not wearing explosives, Umar Zwak, the spokesman for the governor of Helmand province, said after reviewing the initial investigation report. Karzai said he ordered the Interior Ministry to eventually give Spozhmai back to her parents after getting assurances from them that the girl will be able to continue her family life like other children.

"New York (CNN) -- Horrific new details in the beating death of 4-year-old Myls Dobson emerged Wednesday during the arraignment of his New York caretaker. Kryzie King, 27, who was indicted last month on 12 felony and misdemeanor charges, including first-degree assault, first-degree assault reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child, pleaded not guilty in Manhattan criminal court. Myls died January 8 after his father, Okee Wade, left the boy in the care of King before Wade went to jail in connection with a fraud case, police said. King told investigators she starved, beat and burned the boy before his death, according to a criminal complaint. King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, did not return calls seeking comment. Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the court Wednesday that Myls was a happy, healthy, well-nourished little boy when he arrived at King's home in mid December 2013. But when police found Myls in her apartment, the prosecutor said, his body was burned, bruised and cut from head to toe. Blumberg, part of the district's attorney's child-abuse unit, told the court that King admitted to police that the child lost between 10 and 20 pounds as she watched him starve. He hadn't eaten and barely had any liquid for nearly two weeks before his death, the prosecutor said. In addition, he endured two weeks of torture allegedly at the hands of King, who told police he had been misbehaving. The prosecutor told the court that the physician who performed an autopsy on Myls said no known diseases appeared to cause his death. The medical examiner's officer determined that Myls sustained injuries to his head, neck, face, abdomen, legs, wrists, ankles, fingers, armpit and testicles, Blumberg told the court. According to the medical examiner, his injuries were at multiple stages of healing and consistent with non-accidental trauma. Additionally, the medical examiner reviewed photographs of objects recovered from King's home -- including belts with metal ends, wires, a George Foreman grill and an oven rack -- and concluded there were distinct pattern marks on the body consistent with the objects, Blumberg told the court. The investigation by the medical examiner's office is expected to conclude within the next month, the prosecutor said, adding that all evidence indicated that Myls' death was caused by King. Blumberg said the district attorney is still investigating murder charges and will likely bring additional charges once autopsy findings are final. Myls was found unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of a bathroom at King's apartment at the Ritz Plaza, a luxury high-rise in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. Myls was later pronounced dead at a hospital. In the final weeks of his brief life, Myls suffered unspeakable acts of neglect and violence, according to a criminal complaint. King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the ""child's primary and sole caretaker"" until the time of his death, the complaint said. King, who is being held without bail in a medical facility on Riker's Island, is due back in court March 26.","Kryzie King, 27, pleaded not guilty to assault, reckless endangerment, other charges .

"(CNN) -- At least nine miners remain trapped in a South African gold mine after an underground fire, the Harmony Gold mining company said Wednesday. South African emergency workers rescued eight other miners and brought them to the surface at the Doornkop mine, west of Johannesburg. ""Rescue teams continue the search for the remaining nine miners who are still unaccounted for,"" the company said in a prepared statement. ""The underground fire has been subdued, although conditions underground remain challenging."" It said the eight miners who were rescued were unharmed but would be kept under medical observation during the night as a precaution. The fire is reported to have broken out about 1,733 meters (5,700 feet) underground around 6 p.m. local time Tuesday. Harmony Gold spokesman James Duncan said seismic activity -- a magnitude-2.4 tremor that caused rock to fall -- may have caused the fire. ""The rock fell, damaged a cable, which we think caused a spark which then ignited something and caused the fire,"" he said. ""Obviously, this is all subject to inquiry. Our priority is finding the missing men."" All operations other than essential services at the mine have been suspended.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- As violence raged on Thursday in central Kiev, 21-year-old volunteer medic Olyesa Zhukovska was providing first aid to wounded protesters when she was struck in the neck by a sniper's bullet. ""I'm dying,"" she tweeted as blood gushed from her throat. Even as her prediction proved wrong, her tweet was immortalized as it ricocheted across the Internet. Two days later, from a hospital bed, she recalled the moment when she was struck. ""I heard a loud bang,"" she told CNN. ""At first, I thought it was a grenade, but then my friend said, 'You have been hit by a sniper; you are bleeding.' Both our hands were full of blood."" The bullet had pierced her neck, somehow missing vital vessels, but doing serious damage nonetheless. ""It is very hard for me to speak and it hurts to eat,"" she said weakly. ""I'm starting to walk again; I lost a lot of blood."" At the time she was shot, Zhukovska was on a front line in the battle between opposition and security forces trying to help the wounded. She was lucky. Dozens of other demonstrators who were defending the barricades in Independence Square were killed on Thursday, nearly a third of them by snipers. The location had been transformed Saturday into a memorial. At the hospital, Zhukovska's parents were by her side on Saturday, offering succor even as their daughter's spirit remained defiant. ""We are waiting for new elections,"" she said weakly. ""We want a different president, a different government and a better situation in Ukraine."" Zhukovska said she was glad her tweet had reached so many people; her parents were glad it proved wrong. CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this story .","""I'm dying,"" 21-year-old medic tweets .

"(CNN) -- A convicted child rapist apparently cut off his ankle monitor and left a Colorado group home where he was serving parole, a state official said. A fugitive warrant was requested minutes after Eric Eugene Hartwell, 51, walked away from ""Independence House"" in Denver Friday evening, Colorado Corrections Department spokesman Roger Hudson told CNN Sunday. Hartwell was convicted of raping a child in 1991 and attempted indecent liberties in 1996, according to the Colorado sex offender registry. ""This is an active investigation of an absconder that we are hoping not to send even farther underground,"" Hudson said. The corrections department's fugitive apprehension unit is working with other law enforcement agencies to find Hartwell ""as quickly as possible,"" he said. Hartwell was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to serve a lifetime of supervised parole by a federal judge in Texas in March 2010 after he was found guilty of failing to register as a sex offender, according to a U.S. Justice Department news release. Hartwell was placed in a halfway house in Washington state in March 2009 for failure to register as a sex offender, but after just a week there he cut off his leg monitor and fled to Texas, according to the Justice Department.

"(CNN) -- A haunting image by American photographer John Stanmeyer of African migrants in Djibouti has won the prestigious World Press Photo of the Year 2013 award. The image ""shows African migrants on the shore of Djibouti city at night, raising their phones in an attempt to capture an inexpensive signal from neighboring Somalia -- a tenuous link to relatives abroad,"" the World Press Photo foundation said. The migrants' phone screens glow against the blue-toned night sky as they raise them toward a bright full moon. Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, is a common stop for migrants in transit from such countries as Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea seeking a better life in Europe and the Middle East, the foundation said. Jury member Jillian Edelstein, a South African-born but UK-based photographer, said, ""It's a photo that is connected to so many other stories -- it opens up discussions about technology, globalization, migration, poverty, desperation, alienation, humanity. ""It's a very sophisticated, powerfully nuanced image. It is so subtly done, so poetic, yet instilled with meaning, conveying issues of great gravity and concern in the world today."" U.S. jury member David Guttenfelder said: ""The photo is like a message in a bottle, it is one that will last for all of us. People will bring their own life experiences to it as they stand in front of it."" The photo, which was shot for National Geographic magazine, also won the contemporary issues category at the annual World Press Photo contest. Stanmeyer stands to win 11,500 euros in total ($15,750.) The winners in all eight categories, as well as the overall award, were announced in the Netherlands on Friday. First prize in the general news category was claimed by Italian photographer Alessandro Penso, with a photograph of an emergency refugee center in an abandoned school in Sofia, Bulgaria, that is housing about 800 Syrian refugees. French photographer Philippe Lopez won the spot news category with a striking image of survivors of Typhoon Haiyan taking part in a religious procession.

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder is calling on Congress to require companies to more quickly alert customers when their personal information is put at risk in cyberbreaches. In a video message Monday, Holder says ""a strong, national standard for quickly alerting consumers whose information may be compromised ... would empower the American people to protect themselves if they are at risk of identity theft. It would enable law enforcement to better investigate these crimes -- and hold compromised entities accountable when they fail to keep sensitive information safe. "" Federal law currently doesn't offer any standard for companies to notify customers following breaches, though some states have notification laws. Many companies are wary that public notification will hurt their business. Proposals in Congress to require a uniform notification and security standard have languished for years. Support for one bill proposed by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, has grown in the wake of the massive breach of retailer Target, which Holder says compromised personal information of up to 70 million people, including credit- and debit-card data of 40 million Target customers. Leahy's bill proposes to do much of what Holder is asking. Holder's proposal in some ways contrasts with how law enforcement has dealt with past breaches. During past cyber break-ins, investigators have asked companies to not immediately make the information public. In some cases, cybercriminals are known to return to exploit the vulnerabilities, and investigators may be able to gather evidence as new breaches occur. The rise of cybercrime in recent years has alarmed U.S. officials. One well-regarded report on data breaches produced by Verizon says there were 621 confirmed breaches in 2012, and that many breaches go unreported. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey told a Senate committee last fall that soon the cybercrime threat will equal or surpass the threat from terrorism. The Obama administration has come up with legislative proposals to better defend the country from cyberattacks but that effort has largely been shelved, a casualty of the controversy surrounding government surveillance after disclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. The NSA would be a lead agency in any national cyberstrategy, and the agency is politically damaged post-Snowden. One criticism of mandated notification is that the number of such reported crimes could overwhelm law enforcement. Holder, in his video message, says any legislation should also provide exemptions for minor breaches. Holder says the breach at Target and another retailer Neiman Marcus around Christmastime last year shows the need for better tools for law enforcement. ""This legislation would strengthen the Justice Department's ability to combat crime and ensure individual privacy -- while bringing cybercriminals to justice,"" he says.

"NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- After enduring one of the most dramatic days in its history, Wall Street received a climactic jolt Monday when Lehman Brothers, a 158-year-old investment bank undermined by bad bets on real estate, said it will file for bankruptcy. Lehman's stock prices have plummeted 94 percent this year. The fall of Lehman followed a wild, three-day scramble by top Wall Street executives and federal regulators who worked around the clock to come up with a solution to a still-unfolding financial crisis. By the end of the weekend, the Federal Reserve had stepped in to try to calm the markets by announcing plans to loosen its lending restrictions to the banking industry. A consortium of 10 leading domestic and foreign banks had agreed to create a $70 billion fund to lend to troubled financial firms. And two major financial companies -- Bank of America and Merrill Lynch -- were finalizing a merger. Another -- American International Group -- was reportedly struggling to secure billions of dollars in capital. But it was the fate of Lehman that gripped Wall Street. After weeks of speculation about its health, Lehman's fate took a turn for the worse Sunday when Bank of America and British bank Barclays, both viewed as potential ""white knights,"" pulled out of deal talks, according to sources. ""This looks like the end,"" a Lehman executive, who declined to be identified, told Fortune on Sunday afternoon. Bank of America turned to merger talks with Merrill. Both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported that a deal, which could be worth about $40 billion, was all but finalized. Hours before Bank of America pulled out, Barclays had abandoned talks to buy Lehman, a source close to the situation told CNNMoney.com. All the while, top Wall Street officials and federal regulators, who began meeting Friday, spent much of their Sunday at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the hopes of devising a plan to save Lehman and allay fears that threatened to roil U.S. financial markets Monday. Meanwhile, broader efforts to tackle problems plaguing the entire industry are under way. The Federal Reserve announced a series of steps to support the financial markets. The Fed said it would expand its short-term lending to banks by starting to take all investment-grade debt as collateral -- instead of just Treasuries and other high-grade securities. ""The steps we are announcing today, along with significant commitments from the private sector, are intended to mitigate the potential risks and disruptions to markets,"" said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. (Full story) Similarly, a group of 10 commercial and investment banks including, among others, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays and Morgan Stanley, agreed to pony up $7 billion each to create a $70 billion lending pool to help troubled institutions. The measure would also help resolve exposure between Lehman Brothers and its counterparts, the companies said. (Full story) Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who has led efforts to help get the U.S. housing market and the broader economy back on track, applauded the plan and steps taken by regulators. ""These initiatives will be critical to facilitating liquid, smooth functioning markets, and addressing potential concerns in the credit markets,"" Paulson said in a statement. Yet the last-minute efforts provided little comfort to financial markets around the globe. As of Sunday evening, U.S. markets were headed for a steep selloff at the start of Monday's session.  Watch early global market reaction to the Lehman bankruptcy » . Futures in the Dow Jones industrial average, as well as the broader Nasdaq composite and the Standard & Poor's 500 were as much as 3 percent lower, before paring some of their losses. Investors already started piling into safe-haven Treasuries as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note dipped to 3.565 percent from 3.72 percent late Friday. That nervousness also spread to the currency markets as the dollar eased against both the euro and the yen. Adding to those concerns was news that insurance giant AIG planned to unveil a restructuring plan that will include the sale of part of its business to raise cash and boost investors' confidence, according to a published report. (Full story) Investors are also likely to await more data about troubled savings and loan Washington Mutual, which sought to provide assurance about capital levels on Thursday. What could help temper a market selloff is the widely anticipated Bank of America-Merrill deal, said one expert. (Full story) ""This sort of offsets the Lehman thing,"" said Dan Alpert, managing director of the boutique New York City-based investment bank Westwood Capital. ""But the reality is that it is just a short-term impact."" Still, much of the market's focus ahead of Monday was on the endgame for Lehman. The hope was that some solution could be found by early Monday morning in the U.S. -- before financial markets open in Europe. Most Asian markets are closed for a holiday Monday. But the abandonment of Barclays and Bank of America left Lehman Brothers teetering. During the afternoon, and adding to the dark cloud hanging over Lehman, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association staged a special trading session so that big brokers could limit their Lehman Brothers risks. The session was called ""to reduce risk associated with a potential Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. bankruptcy,"" according to a statement on the ISDA's Web site. Lehman -- one of the nation's largest and oldest investment banks -- has suffered a dramatic and rapid descent. Its shares, which sold for as much as $67 in the past 12 months, have plummeted 94 percent this year and now trade at $3.65. In the past six months, the company has reported $6.7 billion in losses due largely to bad bets on real estate. At the same time, concern is growing about problems throughout the financial sector. Chaotic week . A chaotic week for Lehman and Wall Street The talks followed what has been one of the most tumultuous weeks ever on Wall Street. Things first started to unravel at Lehman last Tuesday following reports that talks between the state-run Korea Development Bank, who was rumored to be interested in buying a stake in Lehman, had ended. That, combined with the threat of a downgrade by some of the credit ratings agencies, led to a bloody sell-off in the firm's stock. Hoping to finally put all the rumors to rest, the company released its third-quarter results more than a week in advance on Wednesday, booking a nearly $4 billion loss and announcing a drastic restructuring plan. (Full story) Investors were unconvinced though and the sell-off in Lehman shares continued, with the stock plunging 42 percent last Wednesday. By Thursday evening, it was widely reported that Lehman was actively seeking a buyer for the entire firm. The company reportedly reached out to a number of suitors, including Bank of America and Barclays.  Watch the impact on global markets from Lehman's financial woes » . Speculation also surfaced Friday that J.C. Flowers & Co. and other private equity firms were considering a bid for all or parts of Lehman. Current regulatory restrictions prevent buyout firms from owning a bank outright, although the Federal Reserve has eyed loosening those restrictions as bank failures pile up. But as Friday wore on without any news of a deal, Lehman's stock wound up falling another 13.5 percent. Shares plunged 77 percent during the course of the week, setting the stage for regulators to call upon banking executives to get together Friday night and begin talking about ways to hash out an end to the Lehman crisis. High-profile deals . Lehman's bankruptcy marks a bitter coda for one of Wall Street's oldest and most well-known firms. Getting its start as a modest cotton-trading firm in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1850 by German immigrant brothers Henry, Emanuel and Mayer Lehman, the firm saw its fortunes rise and fall along with the rest of Wall Street. After World War II, Lehman's profile grew as it advised such household U.S. companies as Ford, Campbell Soup and Philip Morris on deals, before expanding overseas into Europe and Asia in the 1960s and 1970s. The firm also became a breeding ground for high-profile dealmakers. Both Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson, co-founders of the private equity giant Blackstone Group, worked for Lehman in the early 1980s. But Lehman's rise was cut short in April 1984, when the company agreed to be purchased by Shearson/American Express for $360 million. The company emerged independent just seven years later, albeit in much weaker shape than it was before. It was around that time, however, that CEO Richard Fuld Jr., assumed the helm at Lehman and the firm went public after splitting off from American Express. Known for his direct approach and staunch loyalty to the firm, Fuld transformed Lehman in the decade that followed from a lowly bond trading house into a worthy adversary of larger investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Still, there were bumps along the way for the long-time Lehman chief, including the Russian credit crisis and the painful collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in the late 1990s. Fuld was quick to remind investors of those painful days and subsequent comeback during a conference call Wednesday, just after the company revealed its nearly $4 billion third-quarter loss. ""But the obstacles Lehman faced this time around proved too tough for Fuld to overcome.

In the last week alone, federal judges in Kentucky and Virginia ruled that their states' bans on same- sex marriage are unconstitutional. The rulings come on the heels of judges in conservative states of Oklahoma and Utah who ruled that marriage bans are unconstitutional. Nevada announced that it will no longer defend its ban on same-sex marriage. And LGBT rights groups are pleased that the Indiana Senate amended its proposal for a ban on same-sex marriage because it buys them more time. The earliest it can be on the ballot for public approval is 2016. Last week in Kansas, in what would have been one of the most draconian measures facing same-sex couples in recent years, the state Senate decided to forego voting on a measure that would permit businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples. After the Kansas state House passed the bill that is said to protect religious freedom, the Senate realized it is too toxic to touch. It doesn't mean that advocates are only moving forward. Warbelow said they are watching a series of bills in state legislatures that limit LGBT rights in terms of relationships and the workplace. One step forward, two steps back . But for LGBT advocates, it's more like two steps forward, one step back. Washington has also added to the onslaught. Attorney General Eric Holder earlier this month announced that the federal government will expand the recognition of same-sex marriages in federal legal matters, including bankruptcies, prison visits and survivor benefits. Actress Ellen Page: ""I am gay"" Analysts expect the Supreme Court to rule on the issue soon, especially as the four previously mentioned states' decisions are now in the pipeline, adding to the pile of same-sex marriage related case load. While the federal government has made a lot of changes in recent years, including repealing the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and President Barack Obama's publicized support of same-sex marriage, advocates aren't only seeing victory. 'Unsustainable' The House of Representatives is sitting on a federal version of the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, known as ENDA, which would issue federal employee protections for sexual orientation and gender identity. And Obama hasn't addressed the ""low-hanging fruit,"" including signing an executive order banning workplace discrimination of gay, lesbian and transgender federal contractors. Public opinion is moving more quickly than judges and elected officials. According to a national Quinnipiac University poll from September, 56% of Americans support marriage for same-sex couples, compared with only 25% who supported it in 1996. A CNN poll in 2010 was the first one that suggested that a majority of respondents backed it. Same-sex marriage a dying political issue . Republican strategist Ana Navarro said recently on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that opinions on same-sex marriage represent the ""most rapid social change that we've seen in our lifetime."" As for the patchwork of state laws, Human Rights Campaign's Warbelow said it's ""unsustainable in the long run."" Chelsea Clinton agreed. She said the issue is ""unfinished business.""

"Majuro, Marshall Islands (CNN) -- Jose Salvador Alvarenga, the mysterious castaway who turned up in the Marshall Islands last week, has been released from a hospital. He had been readmitted Thursday amid concerns that his health was deteriorating. Doctors reported that he was severely dehydrated, running low on vitamins and suffering from swollen legs. Alvarenga, whose tale of surviving 13 months adrift in the Pacific Ocean has prompted fascination and skepticism, left the hospital Friday and is now staying at a hotel in Majuro, the capital of the island chain. Hospital officials didn't provide an update on his condition. But Dr. Franklin House, a retired American medic working at the hospital who has spent time with Alvarenga, said he was concerned about the state of the castaway's kidneys. Alvarenga, an El Salvadoran who had been living in Mexico before he got lost at sea, washed ashore in the Marshall Islands more than a week ago. Earlier this week, his condition improved enough for him to be released from the hospital. What you should know about his journey . But after his health took a turn for the worse Thursday, plans for his repatriation to El Salvador have now been postponed. House, who is not Alvarenga's treating physician, said the castaway had complained to him of kidney pain since his arrival at the hospital. The 78-year-old doctor, who speaks Spanish, said he suspects that Alvarenga is suffering from scurvy as a result of his poor diet and that edemas are causing the swelling and pain in his legs. Alvarenga has said that he survived during his months at sea by eating raw fish and turtles. He says he relied on rainwater and urine for fluids. When the doctor spoke with the castaway, he noticed that his fingers were stiff and he moved his hands slowly. Alvarenga complained of pain in his joints, knees and ankles, House said. The first time House saw Alvarenga in the emergency room, his legs were hard and his skin was leathery. But when he returned to the hospital this week, his legs had changed to swollen, and his skin was tender and red, he said. The doctor's assumption is that the castaway is recovering, but that it is a process that will take weeks, not days. House also believes that Alvarenga is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Official: His story is probable . Alvarenga's claims have garnered widespread skepticism about how he could survive for 13 months adrift in the Pacific. But from what officials can tell, they have no reason to doubt him. ""The investigations into Mr. Alvarenga's story so far have been substantiated,"" Phillip Muller, the Marshall Islands' foreign affairs minister, said Thursday. Christian Clay-Mendoza, a Mexican diplomat working on Alvarenga's case, said that the castaway was an undocumented worker in Mexico, but that ""what he has said to us about his identity, so far, has been true."" ""The main question now is how long was he at sea,"" he said. Clay-Mendoza said ""it's probable"" that Alvarenga did get lost at sea starting in December 2012, as the castaway has claimed. If Alvarenga's story proves true, the trip across the Pacific would have taken him across roughly 6,600 miles (10,800 kilometers) of open ocean before ending in the Marshall Islands, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, in the northern Pacific. The other man . Alvarenga says he set off on a fishing trip from the port of Paredon Viejo, Mexico, near the southern coastal city of Tonala. He said he and another man intended to spend a day trying to catch sharks, but they were blown off course by winds and then got caught in a storm, eventually losing use of their engines. Bellarmino Rodriguez Beyz, the owner of Alvarenga's boat in Mexico, identified the fishing partner as 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova. Alvarenga said that four weeks into their drift, his companion died of starvation because he refused to eat raw birds and turtles. Eventually, he threw the body overboard. ""What else could I do?"" Alvarenga said. A grieving family . Back in the Mexican village of El Fortin, Cordova's family is inconsolable. More than a year after the young man went missing, his mother is grieving his death. ""The pain is so great, I can't explain it,"" Cordova's mother said. ""Losing a child is the hardest thing to bear in life."" Cordova's brother said the 23-year-old took care of his family -- and that's why he became a fisherman, in hopes of earning a better livelihood. ""My brother was kind, he was responsible for my mother,"" he said. ""In fact, he worked in the sea because of her. He wanted to improve himself. He didn't want to be poor, like us."" Now that Cordova's mother knows her son is dead, she wants answers. ""As a mother, I demand the authorities allow me to talk to the survivor,"" she said. ""Only in that way will I know what happened, and what he did with the body of my son. I deserve to know the truth. "" Suzanne Chutaro and Jack Niedenthal reported from Majuro, Marshall Islands; Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Holly Yan and Nick Parker also contributed to this report.","The castaway is now staying at a hotel in the island chain's capital .

"(CNN) -- State and federal investigations are underway in the case of lane closures that clogged traffic on the George Washington Bridge in New Jersey in August. Politicians and pundits are tossing around accusations of wrongdoing by employees of the New York-New Jersey Port Authority and the office of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The national press may feast on the political implications for New Jersey's Republican governor, but I think the episode is symptomatic of a larger, more troubling issue. The deliberate political action resulted in life-threatening situations and delays that cost more than $21 million of economic losses to businesses and families. But the same situation faces millions of Americans every day because of the deterioration of our nation's infrastructure and political gridlock. The George Washington Bridge is emblematic of thousands of other bridges nationwide -- it suffers from chronic traffic jams, has a long maintenance backlog and is showing signs of aging that you'd expect in an 83-year-old superstructure. And while the bridge is undergoing an eight-year, billion-dollar renovation, it remains the busiest bridge in the world. It is a major connector of commercial industry and human capital in the Northeast that will require upkeep for decades to come. In other words, the George Washington Bridge's condition is mirrored by other bridges coast to coast. American bridges are in bad shape, and there is a dire need for massive funding to shore them up or rebuild them. As we know from major bridge collapses in Minneapolis in 2007 and in Washington State in May 2013, we're seeing more and more that merely driving across some bridges might mean that you are putting yourself at risk. Rather than focusing only on the question of whether certain New Jersey politicians can ""survive"" the unfolding political scandal, we need to ask whether millions of Americans who cross the nation's bridges every day are going to survive their trips. We need to question why political battles at the congressional level have gummed up the funding for improving America's bridges. This is a slow-motion scandal with far-ranging implications. Why is political gamesmanship stopping the critical investment in our country's future that labor, the Chamber of Commerce and the American public overwhelmingly support? This political gridlock is about national elected officials from both sides of the aisle who -- over the span of several presidential administrations -- have failed to make the upkeep and revitalization of our bridges a top priority. The condition of U.S. bridges and our national infrastructure -- roads, sewers, manufacturing and energy facilities -- should be inseparable from the debate over how to end our economic malaise. The troubling state of our bridges, in particular, is a premium example of how political priorities have created gridlock that impact millions of Americans every day. By ending political gridlock that is in the way of funding for major infrastructure projects, jobs can be created, lives can be saved and the future of transportation and commerce will be secured. Instead, bridges continue to decay and desperately needed maintenance projects are still dangerously backlogged. Consider this: . -- The United States, including Puerto Rico, is home to more than 66,700 structurally deficient bridges and 84,748 functionally obsolete bridges, the Federal Highway Administration reports. -- Last year, the American Society of Civil Engineers rated one out of nine U.S. bridges as structurally deficient, and also found that the average age of the nation's 607,380 bridges is 42 years. As a journeyman iron worker and representative of more than 100,000 workers -- including thousands of bridge workers -- I read about the George Washington Bridge-related political squabbling taking place now in New Jersey and interpret it differently. As I see it, the real scandal here is in the question of how a critically vital piece of America's infrastructure -- the bridges that are our lifelines to jobs, hospitals and economic development -- have been neglected for so long. Where is the outrage over the political gamesmanship at the congressional level that has caused desperately needed work on American bridges to grind to a halt? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Walter W. Wise.","Walter Wise says the attention focused on New Jersey's bridge scandal is misplaced .

"(CNN) -- Ayan Mohamed wears a niqab that covers her face, not for religious reasons but to hide what lies beneath. ""She wears it to cover the deformity. She covers it because people would stare, children would cry,"" says Edna Adan Ismail, Somaliland's former foreign minister and first lady. ""It's not easy to look at."" Ismail founded the region's first maternity hospital, The Edna Adan University Hospital. The facility is now a bustling general clinic providing care to all. For 11 years, she's been seeking help to repair Mohamed's face, which was torn apart by shrapnel during the Somali Civil War. Mohamed was just two years old when she was injured. She is now 25 and can't close her right eye. Food falls from the hole in her cheek when she tries to eat. She's long learned to deal with stares and awkward questions. ""The hardest thing for her is when somebody asks what happened to her face,"" Ismail says, translating the softly spoken words from Mohamed, who's seated beside her. ""It just hurts me,"" Mohamed says. They're sitting at a press conference in Brisbane, Australia, a shiny modern city some 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) -- and a world away -- from her home and her daughter in Burao, northwest Somaliland in the Horn of Africa. Her child, Marwa, is just two years old, the same age as Mohamed when she was so horrifically injured. Oral and maxillofacial surgeon Dr. John Arvier from the Wesley Hospital is explaining the extent of the damage to her face and what's going to be done to fix it by a team of experts, who are offering their services for free. ""Essentially Ayan is missing most of the tissue of her midface from the bottom part of the eye socket, the whole top jaw and most of the cheekbone and her palate,"" Arvier says. ""The surgery will involve replacing, with a small synthetic implant, the rim of the eye socket. Then the bulk of the missing tissue will be replaced by muscle that comes up under the cheekbone on the side of the head."" Skin taken from her forearm will be moved to her face, and a plastic surgeon will also use cartilage from her ear to rebuild her nostril. Extensive dental work will then be needed to reshape her smile. From behind her veil, Mohamed expresses her faith in the team of surgeons. ""I'm confident, I'm not worried."" Ismail adds, ""She's a brave woman. She's had to live with this a long time... she's very relaxed. I'm the one who's falling apart."" She first heard of Mohamed's plight when the girl's mother went to her hospital several years ago seeking help. Then, the hospital in Hargeisa, Somaliland had been open just one year and didn't have the expertise to deal with Mohamed's problems. It still doesn't. Ismail spread the word about Mohamed's injuries and a website was built. Photos were taken. And, since it was uploaded to YouTube in 2009, a video about Mohamed's need for help has been viewed more than two million times. Two years ago, a group of Rotarians in Australia met and vowed to bring Mohamed to the country for surgery. It wasn't easy. There's no postal service in Somaliland so something as simple as sending a letter required outside help. And then there was the travel -- Mohamed had to travel hundreds of kilometers to the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa for scans, x-rays and assessments. Just when the medical challenges seemed to have been resolved, the Australian government refused Mohamed's visa application. It was the second time a country had denied her approval to enter because her injuries weren't deemed to be life threatening. ""Since this is not a growing cancer or a heart condition or a situation that could kill her overnight, I guess some people would classify that as not life threatening,"" Ismail says. ""But then when you're a young women what's more life threatening than not having a face?"" ""The first visa denial was from the United States, and that was hard. And then when the visa was denied a second time in Australia, we thought 'who will have the courage to tell this to Ayan?',"" she says. ""Here's a woman who's only begging to have medical treatment which she's not able to access anywhere else. I'm glad that the decision was reversed,"" she adds. Since Mohamed arrived in Brisbane there have been a number of firsts. ""She saw a river for the first time yesterday,"" Ismail says. ""And walking up to this conference room she saw fish in a fish tank for the first time. ""She rode an elevator for the first time (and) we had a few lessons to learn how to ride the escalator -- we had a few almost-trips but we're here,"" she laughs. Ayan will undergo surgery on Saturday. Recovery will take weeks, if not months. When the scars have healed Ayan hopes to be able to face the world for the first time with nothing to hide. ""She says she's looking forward to removing this,"" Ismail says, motioning toward the black niqab that cloaks Ayan's features, ""and to have a face like everyone else.""","Ayan Mohamed to undergo surgery in Brisbane to rebuild her face .
She was disfigured at the age of two during the Somali Civil War .

"(CNN) -- House Republicans pushed through a trillion-dollar farm bill -- approved by the Senate Tuesday -- that will cut food stamps by $8 billion over the next decade and reduce food allotments for more than 850,000 households by around $90 a month. The measure passed despite opposition from Tea Party Republicans who were seeking even more savage cuts. If the Republican Party hopes to revive the Bush-era idea of ""compassionate conservatism,"" this isn't the way to do it. The bill was the culmination of a three-year battle over food stamps, also called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. House Democrats who supported the measure said they compromised. This version, they said, was better than previous ones; Tea Party Republicans had wanted a 5% cut, not 1%. The White House has signaled that President Obama will sign the bill. He shouldn't, but this is a pragmatic president. So he probably will. That the legislation slashes aid to hungry children might be justifiable if it didn't also hand out $90 billion over 10 years -- $7 billion more than before -- in subsidized crop insurance to farmers, which virtually guarantees revenue. The agribusiness lobby, which includes large farming concerns as well as publicly traded corporations like Monsanto and Kroger, spent $111 million pressing lawmakers, according to Bloomberg. That's more than the defense and union lobbies combined. Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat who voted against the measure, called it ""nothing more than reverse Robin Hood legislation that steals food from the poor in favor of crop subsidies for the rich."" If not for the hungry children, there might be a bright side. It's not every day that the real constituency of establishment Republicans is revealed so clearly. Typically, the GOP's representation of big business is shrouded by rhetorical expressions of concern for workaday Americans. For instance, after President Obama announced he would use his executive authority to raise the base wage of workers employed by companies with federal contracts, House Speaker John Boehner accused Obama of hurting workers by hurting their employers. ""We know from increases in the minimum wage in the past that hundreds of thousands of low-income Americans have lost their jobs, and so the very people the President purports to help are the ones who are going to get hurt by this,"" Boehner told reporters last week on Capitol Hill. While it may sound credible to argue that paying workers $3 and some change more per hour actually hurts them in the long run (because businesses hiring them shed workers to avoid paying more), it's completely incredible to say feeding hungry Americans more hurts them. The most extreme wing of the Republican Party, including those who opposed the farm bill, claims that it spends money the government doesn't have. If so, such moments of scarcity demand tough and moral decisions be made according to priorities. With this bill, the Republicans have said loudly that corporations with billions in revenue are more important than children. The Republicans' real constituency isn't the only thing exposed. So is their opposition to ""redistribution."" That's movement conservatism's core complaint with the welfare state: They say government takes money from hard-working Americans, who play by the rules and strive to succeed, and gives it to the undeserving poor. Another variation comes from talk-radio show host Rush Limbaugh: ""Redistribution is theft,"" he said last month. ""It is a powerful government taking from people they deem to have too much, or more than they need, and then just giving it to people they deem worthy of receiving it."" But as this farm bill reveals, Republicans are not opposed to redistribution at all. Quite the contrary. The question isn't whether the government should redistribute. The question is who should get the distributions. Republicans have argued for years that help should only be given to those who help themselves. During a fundraising event, Lee Bright, a Republican state senator of South Carolina who is challenging U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, said: ""Able-bodied people, if they don't work, they shouldn't eat."" That argument is exposed as fundamentally bankrupt in light of the fact, as journalist Sasha Abramsky reported last year, that ""22% of children in America live in poverty -- a number far higher than that in any other peer nation. More than 47 million Americans avoid hunger only because of the existence of the federal food stamp program."" But of course this is about hungry children. Lots of them. Perhaps worst of all is the moral climate created and maintained by Limbaugh & Co. in which depriving children of food is permissible. Case in point: In Utah recently, around 40 students in one of Salt Lake City's elementary schools watched as food-service workers seized their lunches and threw them into the trash. The reason? Unpaid meal accounts. Said one outraged mother: ""These are young children that shouldn't be punished."" Amen to that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Stoehr.","John Stoehr: If GOP wants ""compassionate conservatism,"" food stamp cuts aren't the way .
Stoehr: Cuts might be justified if agribusiness didn't get $90 billion over 10 years .
He says the GOP is not opposed to redistribution of wealth if it gets distributed to the wealthy ."

"Beslan, RUSSIA (CNN) -- First there was the blast, and then as sight as surreal as it was ghastly. Dozens of children, naked bar their underwear, running barefoot into the village, peppered with blood, screaming. After three days agonizing, the siege to end the standoff at Middle School Number One, in Beslan, southern Russia, began with a huge explosion in the gym where dozens of militants had herded 1,200 children and parents. The explosives inside had been rigged up between two basketball hoops and the hostages lined the walls of the gym. One witness said the blast caused it to ""rain meat"" inside the gym. Those who could, ran. They fled between houses, stripped of their clothes because of the scorching heat they had endured in the glass-windowed gym, where many were forced to drink urine to hydrate, towards a village that had been holding its breath for over 50 hours. The hostage crisis in Beslan, and the bungled, reckless operation that the Russian military allowed to happen, was a defining moment in Putin's war in southern Russia. Moscow's use of blunt instruments to fix its increasingly Islamist rebellion in the restless North Caucasus, had blatantly not worked, despite two wars to end Chechen separatism, and had instead created a new radicalized, implacable monster, capable of blowing children to pieces, perhaps under the justification they were, in Beslan's region of North Ossetia, Christians. Unrecognizable horror . There was remarkable bravery shown by Russian special forces during the rescue operation, just none from their political masters. The siege began, but no cordon was put in place, so the media and villagers could simply walk into the school's yard, and even the school itself, unimpeded. I watched the Vimpel detachment of Russian spetznaz race past me, headlong into the school, unsupported and outgunned. They must have known they were running to their deaths, but sprinted all the same. I watched one of them brace himself against a door frame, before turning a corner to fire. Body after body was brought out, most shipped away by locals in cars rushed in for the purpose -- there was no triage system, just brave emergency services workers, who also died rescuing children. One militant was dragged from the building, his trousers pulled from his waist. Once the locals checked he was circumcised (and therefore, by their logic, Muslim, and hence a gunman), they beat him to a pulp and left his body in the back of a truck. I ran into the gym while the siege was still ongoing, and its floor was a black mush of unrecognizable horror. The fighting went on, into the night, as one militant held out. Putin, who had, when he came to power, pledged to shoot Chechen militants in the toilet, and who had the steel will to order a partially lethal knockout gas and swift military operation to end the siege of a Moscow theater two years earlier, was absent from Beslan. He slipped in the night of the violence, visiting the wounded. Nobody wanted to be associated with Beslan's mess. They still don't. Troubled North Caucasus region plagued by violence . Monument to the dead . It is nearly a decade ago, but still the scenes retain a revolting clarity in my mind. Amid the shrill noise of militant threats ahead of the Sochi Olympic Winter Games, the gym in Beslan is now steeped in silence, a monument to the dead, untouched almost. The body parts that still lay there the day after the bloodshed are gone. The victims' clothes that someone had hung from changing room pegs when I returned three months later -- they too are gone. There are some structural supports to keep the building up, but otherwise it is as if Beslan the village has shielded the school from the passage of time, perhaps because Beslan itself is still caught in the painful task of seeking answers. It is not only the amorphous puzzle to find a ""why"" -- the only surviving gunman's father told me passively that Lenin said, during the Russian civil war, there is ""white and there is red, and there always will be"", but offered little other motivation. It is also their still unresolved bid to find out how negotiations failed and how such a bungled, bloody operation could ever have come to be. Borik Rubayev was orphaned by the blast. Three weeks later, he pointed at the school and matter-of-factly told me his mother and father had died in the school. Three months later, he was at the center of a custody battle between his relatives, some suggesting the large compensation payout he was getting from the state, was fueling the competition. Today, he is 16 and towers in the gym, where he was once physically sheltered by his mother as the bomb went off. He says his memory is patchy, and that the dreams that used to haunt him have ebbed. ""I don't really remember much"", he said. ""Mother and aunt covered me up. Everybody started to run, but the terrorists tried to stop us. We thought it was the end."" He remembers how someone sitting next to him made a run for it, and he followed, and hid somewhere. Then, in the carnage they had begun, an uncharacteristic sign of humanity came from one of the gunmen, he recalls. ""One of the terrorists, I think it was, gave me food and water, then the emergency services came and took me to hospital in a car."" Today, he enjoys basketball, and hopes to avoid conscription in the army. He lives with his aunt, after public pressure resolved the custody dispute. The school he studies in, with another 124 former hostages, is lined with memorials of the spetznaz and medics who gave their lives saving others.

In fact, the building marries a cheerfulness sustained relentlessly by the teachers, with the constant remembering of the dead, as if aimed at making the survivors sit happily with their past. Little peace . The mothers of Beslan, however, know little peace. Anger at the government bloomed after the siege. They felt abandoned in the immediate aftermath, before Moscow poured millions into the town, and its now garish graveyard, as if to compensate for their absence when it was most needed. Those feelings of anger turned into suspicion: Endless investigations have not satisfied some who believe perhaps the government knew of the gunmen's plan and didn't act, or even ordered the first shots fired to prevent them having to negotiate with the militants. Margarita Tuaeva, whose children survived, retains those suspicions even a decade on. ""They started it because they could not get out of this situation in any other way. They didn't want to negotiate. Without Putin's order, that couldn't have happened."" For others, the lack of answers simply amplifies inexhaustible grief.

"(CNN) -- At least four former Marlboro Men, those rugged actors of the famous ad campaign, have died of smoking-related disease. The latest was Eric Lawson, who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by a three-pack-a-day habit. Lawson, the face of what became the best-selling brand of cigarettes, was felled by the lethal products he helped promote. Years ago, he became a forceful voice for tobacco control, advising children not to smoke and working with organizations including the American Cancer Society to warn the public about the hazards of tobacco. Lawson died a week before the release of a new Surgeon General's report showing that, despite decades of progress in reducing smoking rates and holding the tobacco industry responsible for its lies and deception, a tobacco epidemic still exists. About 44 million Americans still smoke, and one-third of all cancer deaths are caused by tobacco use. The report found that a staggering 6 million children alive today will die prematurely from tobacco use. It also found the list of harmful side effects and diseases tied to smoking is growing, including diabetes, erectile dysfunction and rheumatoid arthritis. Fifty years ago this month, the first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health proved that smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease. Former Surgeon General Luther Terry's landmark report launched a major transformation in the way people think about smoking and sparked a public health movement that has led to remarkable progress in the fight against tobacco use and the devastating death and disease that it causes. When the first report was issued in 1964, the smoking rate in America was 42%. That figure has been cut by more than half, to 18% today, thanks in large part to proven tobacco control policies that discourage children and adults from smoking and protect nonsmokers from cigarette smoke. Fifty years ago, passengers could smoke on commercial airplane flights, at work and in movie theaters. There were virtually no smoke-free restaurants. Today, smoking is prohibited on airplanes and in many airports, and nearly half the country's population is protected by smoke-free laws that cover all workplaces, including restaurants and bars. In 1964, a pack of cigarettes could cost as little as 28 cents. The average price today is roughly $6.03, an increase fueled in part by efforts to raise tobacco taxes as a proven way to discourage people from starting the deadly habit. The tobacco industry spent decades lying to the public about the health effects of its products and waging sophisticated marketing campaigns targeting children and low-income populations. As late as 1996, more than three decades after the original Surgeon General's report, tobacco industry executives famously testified -- under oath -- that nicotine isn't addictive and smoking doesn't kill. Then in 2006, a federal judge found the major cigarette companies guilty of intentionally defrauding smokers and potential smokers for financial gain. Because the evidence established that the industry was likely to engage in continued fraud, the judge ordered the large tobacco companies to make ""corrective statements"" admitting their wrongdoing. The Department of Justice and the cigarette companies last month agreed on the details of an advertising campaign that the industry must fund to air the statements in the country's top-selling newspapers and on the major TV networks during prime time. The factual, blunt statements include ""It's not easy to quit"" and ""Smoking kills, on average, 1,200 Americans. Every day."" Fifty years after the country's top health official confirmed that smoking causes death, the industry will finally be compelled to level with the American people about the harm its products cause. We have a long way to go to end suffering and death from tobacco use. Smoking will kill nearly half a million people in America this year and cost the country a staggering $130 billion in health care costs and lost productivity. We must seize this moment in history to renew our national commitment to protecting public health by passing strong tobacco control laws. The most effective ways to help people quit smoking and keep children from starting the deadly habit are by consistently and significantly increasing tobacco taxes, passing comprehensive smoke-free laws that protect all workers from secondhand smoke and fully funding programs that help people quit tobacco and prevent others from starting. Lawmakers at all levels of government must make a priority of these policies to end death and suffering from tobacco use. Without further action, tobacco use will remain the most preventable cause of death in this country, as it has been for more than half a century. For the sake of America's health, we can't afford to ignore this opportunity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Fourth Marlboro Man dies from smoking; new report shows smoking still an epidemic .

"(CNN) -- Grapple fans should head to Mongolia each year on July 11. It's the day the country celebrates its independence, but also the beginning of something equally important: country-wide competitions to discover Mongolia's top wrestler. The wrestle-fest is part of ""naadam"", the annual celebration of traditional Mongolian sports -- wrestling, archery and horse-racing -- that captivates villages, towns and cities across the country for three days. The grand wrestling competition held in the capital Ulaanbaatar is only open to those with a national ranking. But at a local level men, women and children, some as young as four years old, take part in the events. Sporting traditional garb, the reason for the wrestlers' frontless shirts comes from a folktale. It tells of a woman who was disguised as a man and won the wrestling event. To avoid any deception again, wrestlers from then on had to compete bare-chested. While there is plenty of machismo on show, and despite the fact that the festival is often referred to as the ""three manly games,"" women can compete in the archery competition and girls can ride as jockeys in the horse racing. ""Everyone loves horse racing in Mongolia; it's our national sport,"" says Battsetseg Erdenekhuu, who works as a guide for adventure tourists in Mongolia. The annual event has become one of the biggest attractions for tourists visiting the country. Erdenekhuu believes that despite the influx of visitors the games are still as authentic as they have ever been because of their importance to local communities. ""For the main games of wrestling, archery and horse racing, it's still very traditional,"" she says. ""For the naadam opening ceremony in Ulaanbaatar, because more tourists come just for that, it's a bit touristy as there are different shows held just for them."" Local and regional competitions are held across the country, with anyone able to compete in the events. Competitors and competition organizers usually spend around two months training and practicing before the events begin. Like most celebrations anywhere, food is just as important for the festivities, with deep-fried meat dumplings -- ""khuushuur"" -- the most popular dish. ""Naadam with no khuushuur is not a complete naadam,"" says Erdenekhuu. As a celebration of Mongolia's nomadic past, the games will undoubtedly persist, believes Erdenekhuu. But she worries that the fast pace of change in the country with the current boom in mining could diminish the type of life the games commemorate. ""Visitors to the countryside and naadam will find it's still very authentic,"" she says. ""The city is different. Nomad life is very authentic but I'm sure its going to change in a few years.""","Naadam is Mongolia's annual sporting competition celebrated each year on the country's independence day.

"(CNN) -- Miles of sun-kissed beaches, breathtaking mountains and lush rainforests bathed in ethereal lights -- South Africa's varied and dramatic landscape has provided a photogenic backdrop for an increasing number of Hollywood productions in recent years. Global blockbusters like ""Blood Diamond,"" ""Lord of War"" and ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" have all been shot at least partly in the country -- but could there be more hits on the horizon? That could well be the case, as a group of influential film executives from the United States are currently on a 10-day tour across South Africa, having been invited to explore possible set locations for movies and TV productions. As part of their scouting expedition, leading executives from Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros and the Producers Guild will be traveling around the country until March 1, holding meetings with government representatives and industry players, as well as visiting local production houses and facilities, including a stop on the set of the new ""Avengers"" movie, scenes for which are currently being shot in Johannesburg. ""Our visit has been very productive in exploring and analyzing benefits of bringing motion picture and TV productions to South Africa,"" Vance van Petten, executive director of the Producers Guild, told CNN. Different South African entities collaborated to arrange the visit. ""We hope that we will win the hearts and minds of these film executives,"" said Cyril Ndaba, the South African consul-general based in Los Angeles, ""and when they come back they will view South Africa as an alternative filmmaking and film production destination."" Ndaba says the country's diverse scenery, coupled with the experience of talented local crews who've already taken part in major productions, and the fact that South Africa is an English-speaking nation, are all major attractions for big-budget productions. ""South Africa has got a lot to offer,"" he says. ""The sights and sounds of South Africa are so rich; the tapestry of culture; and that's the reason why they will be going to see places around the country,"" he adds. ""South Africa has come of age and it warrants the attention of the whole world."" Incentives and opportunities . The visit comes as South Africa steps up its efforts to promote itself as a premier set location for major productions and boost its image as an emerging force in international filmmaking. According to a 2013 study commissioned by South Africa' National Film and Video Foundation and conducted by Deloitte, the film industry created more than 25,000 jobs in 2012 and contributed over $437 million to the country's economy, directly and indirectly, . In a country like South Africa, troubled by high unemployment and sluggish economic growth, a booming film industry could hold a significant opportunity. In recent years, the country's government has recognized the sector's promise by announcing a string of measures aiming to attract international productions to help stimulate growth, boost employment and generate revenues. Among the incentives are an uncapped 20% rebate for foreign productions shot on location in the country, as well as a 22.5% break if they are also post-produced in South Africa. Van Petten said: ""Government, industry and trade officials ... have been very interested in discussing South Africa's tax incentives and producers' realities in assessing benefits and challenges of producing in the various and diverse regions of South Africa."" Besides van Petten, the film executives currently visiting South Africa are Mary Ann Hughes, vice president, Film and Television Production Planning at Disney, Sara Spring, senior vice president of Feature Production at Paramount and Kate Beyda, senior vice-president of Physical Production at Warner Bros.

"(CNN) -- Johnson & Johnson announced Friday it is voluntarily recalling a single lot of Aveeno Baby Calming Comfort Lotion after a test by the Food and Drug Administration found it contained more of a form of bacteria than specifications allow. ""That test indicated that the lot exceeded the specifications for common bacteria, though extensive testing by an independent laboratory afterward did not show that specifications were exceeded,"" the company said in a news release. ""However, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies Inc. has voluntarily initiated this recall out of an abundance of caution. This action is not being undertaken on the basis of adverse events and the potential for adverse health effects is remote."" The company identified the bacteria as coagulase-negative Staphylococci, which it described as a family of bacteria that naturally occurs in the environment. ""These are common bacteria often found on the skin and scalp of babies and adults, and found in commonly used household and cosmetic products, at very low levels,"" it said. It did not release the amount that was detected. The lot number, embossed on the tube, is 0161LK. The product was distributed in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, the company said. It urged consumers who would like a refund to call 877-298-2525. But Johnson & Johnson Vice President of Communications Bonnie Jacobs said the recall is being carried out at the retail level, and consumers who have bought the affected product can still use it. ""They do not have to take any action,"" she said. The company's news release described the potential for the lotion to adversely affect one's health as ""remote."" The 2,200 tubes in the lot that is being recalled were produced by a third-party manufacturer in Canada, she said. It did not identify the company.","Consumers ""do not have to take any action,"" company spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- After the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, Soviet soldiers had to do the hard, potentially risky, cleanup job. Fears of radiation exposure, sickness and death were rampant. In the months after, however, it wasn't the rate of cancer that increased: it was the rate of suicide. This is now quoted widely in nuclear industry circles as a textbook case of ""radiophobia."" We are hard-wired, it seems, to react with fear to what we don't understand. It's what we all learn as children: remember the story of Chicken Little? The sky is falling. Dan Polanski is in demand around the world as an expert on weapons of mass destruction. CNN has hired him to advise us on the ground about radiation levels and the potential risks. He says right now there is a fear overload and a shortage of fact. ""When we talk about radiophobia, people hear that word 'radiation' and immediately imagine the worst -- we're all going to die and turn into the Toxic Avenger and start mutating,"" he says. The images from the Fukushima nuclear emergency have not helped ease fears. Pictures of a ruined power plant, smoke billowing into the sky after explosions and fires and talk of a potential meltdown have sparked panic. Too many people watching television images, fire-trucks and choppers dumping water on the reactors, smacked of last-ditch desperation. In Tokyo, foreigners have headed for the exits. Long lines have formed at the immigration department; at the airport people line up for flights. Many say the same thing: They just don't trust what they're told. The Japanese government has struggled with communication. Critics say it is often too little, too late. There's a worrying lack of detail. The Tokyo Electric Power Co., which runs the Daiichi plant, has been accused of having a questionable record when it comes to the truth. Officials in Japan may have consistently told people that radiation levels pose no risk to health, but few here are willing to bet their life on that. Terumi Tanaka survived the atomic bomb of Nagasaki. He knows about nuclear fear and suspects people are not getting the truth here. ""The company is hiding information. They are lying about it; they're not disclosing the risk,"" he says. So what are the available facts as they stand right now? Take a comparison with Chernobyl. In the Soviet Union, reactor workers died within weeks. In the final phase of that disaster, radiation hit levels of 6,000 millisieverts per hour. Fukushima Daiichi's peak has been 400 millisieverts per hour, and that's at the red hot center of the plant itself. According to the World Nuclear Association, you need exposure to 1,000 millisieverts per hour before suffering radiation sickness. Even for the heroic workers still in the plant, prolonged exposure, says Polanski, could make them sick, but it will not kill them. ""No, not at all. Four hundred millisieverts sounds scary, but it's not,"" he says. A caveat: this emergency is in uncharted territory, it could always take a turn for the worse. After a week of trying everything and resorting to dropping water from helicopters, several reactors are still overheating. In fact, Japan's nuclear safety agency has now raised the crisis to level 5 on the nuclear event scale. That's the same rating as the partial meltdown of the nuclear plant at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979. But that may be a welcome comparison. At Three Mile Island, radioactive materials were contained within the reactors. No deaths were directly linked to the event, and fallout to the immediate community was measured to be harmless. Still more than 30 years later, some people question the official version. Just like Japan today there is a gap between what people are told and what they choose to believe. Amid crisis, fact whispers and fear screams.","We are hard-wired to react with fear to what we don't understand, Grant says .

"(CNN) -- London's abandoned rail and tube lines have been put to many novel uses down the years functioning as bomb shelters, impromptu party venues and film sets for Hollywood movies. But a new idea to create a mushroom garden in a tunnel beneath Oxford Street is perhaps one of the more unconventional attempts to breathe new life into the UK capital's forgotten subterranean murk. ""Pop Down"" imagines a section of the defunct ""Mail Rail"" tunnel -- a narrow gauge railway used for transporting mail around London which closed in 2003 -- being repurposed as a mushroom farm and pedestrian walkway lit at street level by glass-fiber, mushroom-shaped sculptures. Its creators, London-based Fletcher Priest Architects, say underground tunnels provide the ideal environment for an urban mushroom farm and could supply pop-up ""Funghi"" cafes at the tunnel's entrance and exit. The idea was recently awarded the top prize in the ""High Line for London"" competition run by the UK's Landscape Institute in partnership with the Mayor of London and the Garden Museum. The competition, which attracted 170 submissions, was inspired by New York's High Line -- a derelict section of elevated railroad which has been transformed into a park -- with co-founders Joshua David and Robert Hammond joining the judging panel. ""The response to this competition shows how many ideas are just waiting to happen, on, over or under the streets of London,"" Hammond said in a statement. Runner-up in the competition was ""The Lido Line"" by [Y/N] Studio which proposes turning a section of the Regent's Canal running from Little Venice to Limehouse into a public swimming area. Other entries were also highly commended including an idea for a floating park/farm/wetland near Canary Wharf called ""Barge Walk"" and ""Bridge-It"" which envisions building parks over, under and besides existing railway lines. ""During this Olympic summer it was clear that London's public spaces are coming alive as never before. There is now a popular appetite for making our outdoors more useable and more wonderful,"" Penelope Curtis, director of Tate Britain said in a statement. Shortlisted submissions will be on show at the Garden Museum until October 21.","Proposal to build mushroom garden in disused tunnel wins ""High Line for London"" competition .

"ZURICH, Switzerland  -- Brazil has been awarded the 2014 World Cup finals, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced Tuesday. FIFA president Sepp Blatter makes the announcement that Brazil will host the 2014 World Cup finals. Blatter said Brazil now has ""not only the right, but the responsibility to organize FIFA's World Cup 2014."" Blatter then handed the World Cup trophy to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who flew in for the announcement. ""Soccer is not only a sport for us,"" Lula said. ""It's more than that: Soccer for us is a passion, a national passion."" He promised Brazil ""will now, with great pride, do its homework."" And, he added, ""if everything works out well, we will win once again a World Cup."" Brazil was the only candidate to pitch to host football's global showpiece after South American rivals Colombia pulled out of the running in April. However, Brazil had been told by FIFA it wasn't guaranteed the tournament simply because it was the only candidate, saying it had to provide a solid bid package. Blatter said the lack of competition from other South American nations was one reason behind FIFA's decision Monday to do away with the rotation system that gave each continent a turn at hosting the World Cup. The decision takes effect with the 2018 tournament. ""We are a civilized nation, a nation that is going through an excellent phase, and we have got everything prepared to receive adequately the honor to organize an excellent World Cup,"" Brazilian Football Confederation president Ricardo Teixeira said. Brazilian Sports Minister Orlando Silva, national team coach Dunga, veteran striker Romario and renowned author Paulo Coelho were among those making the trip to Zurich -- and the final decision was made by FIFA's executive committee after a 30-minute presentation. ""Of course, dreams demand hard work and we Brazilians are ready to face this task,"" Coelho said. ""All the countries in the world have two teams -- the national squad and the Brazilian squad."" Brazil hosted the World Cup once before, 57 years ago. Since launching its bid for 2014, Brazil has emphasized why the country needs the World Cup, much more than what it has to offer the tournament. ""Over the next few years we will have a consistent influx of investments. The 2014 World Cup will enable Brazil to have a modern infrastructure,"" Teixeira said. ""In social terms will be very beneficial."" ""Our objective is to make Brazil become more visible in global arenas,"" he added. ""The World Cup goes far beyond a mere sporting event. It's going to be an interesting tool to promote social transformation."" Tuesday's presentation was smoother than the one in July, which underlined Brazil's status as a developing nation with repeated images of its car factories and dry statistics. Blatter had recently questioned Brazil's infrastructure and bid plans, but FIFA said last week that a stadium-inspection trip in August showed the country could put on ""an exceptional"" tournament. However, there have been delays in hosting some major events, problems with violence in the streets and the public transportation system in the country is often overloaded. The Brazilian soccer confederation estimates that the construction and remodeling of stadiums will require an investment of $1.1 billion, though that could vary significantly depending on the cities chosen to host games. Brazil is home to 10 of the world's largest football stadiums, including the famous Maracana where more than 200,000 fans saw the home side lose 2-1 to Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup final. Renovations have since reduced its capacity to 95,000 seats, with thousands more standing. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

"(CNN) -- It has been 17 years since France had a president from the left, but that might be about to change. Francois Hollande, a candidate from the center-left Socialist Party, has significant momentum after edging center-right incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in the first round of France's presidential election on Sunday. If he wins a May 6 runoff against Sarkozy, Hollande would be the first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand in 1995. Sarkozy is seeking his second five-year term, following Jacques Chirac, who served 12 years in office. Sarkozy received 27.2% of the vote in the first round of voting on Sunday, just behind Hollande's 28.6%. As the French prepare for the runoff, here are a few key points to keep in mind: . 1. This is a two-horse race, but other candidates matter. Ten candidates, spanning the entire political spectrum, took part in the first round of voting. But opinion polls always pointed to a runoff between Sarkozy and Hollande. (In France, a presidential candidate must receive more than 50% of the vote to win office. If no one claims a majority in the first round of voting -- and no one ever has, in the current system -- the top two vote-getters advance to a second round of voting.) But even with the predictable Sarkozy-Hollande finish, it was still important to see how many votes the other candidates received. That's because those votes are now up for grabs in the runoff. ""The other candidates have to be given some attention because they exert an influence in the race,"" said Michael Leruth, who teaches a course about the election at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. Finishing behind Hollande and Sarkozy were two extreme candidates: Marine Le Pen on the far right and Jean-Luc Melenchon on the far left. Le Pen, daughter of 2002 presidential finalist Jean-Marie Le Pen, finished third with 17.9% of the vote. Melenchon finished fourth with 11.1%. Their strong showings might cause Hollande to tack more to the left and Sarkozy more to the right before the runoff. ""If you're coming out of the first round with 27%, 28%, you need to make it to 50%. So you have to think of where you are going to make up that difference to prevail in the final round,"" Leruth said. A day after the first round, Sarkozy said he has a ""duty to listen"" to far-right voters after Le Pen's third-place finish. ""We must respect the voters' will,"" he said. 2012 a year of elections: Return of the Left? 2. One issue stands out among the rest. The economy dominates the political agenda in France, much as it does in America. ""Basically for months now, the top issues have been unemployment and purchasing power,"" said Jim Bittermann, CNN's correspondent in Paris. Jobs have been difficult to come by, especially for young people, and that is one of the main reasons that Sarkozy is vulnerable. ""Even though some people would give Sarkozy high marks for doing the kinds of things that might have a positive long-term effect on the economy -- like raising the retirement age to put the system on sounder fiscal footing -- he hasn't been successful in bringing jobs back,"" Leruth said. Comparing Sarkozy and Hollande on their economic policy is not unlike comparing Republicans and Democrats in the United States. ""Hollande is in favor of more government action to stimulate the economy, stimulate spending ... whereas Sarkozy wants to improve the climate for business by lowering some taxes, by talking about repealing the law establishing the 35-hour work week -- a Socialist measure from the late '90s -- to make it possible to work more,"" Leruth said. ""It's more of a private-sector approach."" 3. France and America have more in common than just high unemployment. Immigration, race and the assimilation of France's large Muslim community have been prominent issues leading up to the election, even before the March shootings by an Islamic extremist in Toulouse and Montauban. Sarkozy has been tough on immigration. Last year, a law went into effect banning Islamic face coverings in public places, the so-called burqa ban. And in a recent television interview, Sarkozy said France has ""too many foreigners"" and that the country is not integrating them properly. Sarkozy won the 2007 election by taking a strong stance on race, according to political analyst Simon Persico from the Center of European Studies. But Le Pen, this year's far-right candidate, said Sarkozy hasn't been strong enough while in office. ""Le Pen is saying the original is better than the copy, and that voters should not believe Sarkozy on race,"" he told CNN. 4. The election's result could affect the eurozone. Sarkozy has worked closely with German Chancellor Angela Merkel throughout the European debt crisis, leading the way for strict austerity measures in Greece and other troubled countries. Would Hollande's election encourage a change in strategy? ""There is concern that, within the eurozone, Hollande's election could create greater instability,"" Leruth said. ""He's talked about renegotiating some of the accords that have been reached -- at the instigation of Sarkozy and Merkel -- to ensure greater stability in the eurozone."" The reason is long-term growth. ""I think some of the French like the way (Sarkozy) handled -- with Merkel -- the agreement in December to get more rigor, more austerity into European budgets. But then Hollande and other economists are saying we also need growth, and these plans are going to absolutely stifle growth,"" said Homer Sutton, a French professor at Davidson College near Charlotte, North Carolina. Like Leruth, he is teaching a course on the election. France's own debt is also a concern. Like the United States, the country recently had its AAA credit rating downgraded. Hollande has promised to create tens of thousands of public-sector jobs and raise taxes on the rich to pay for them. But some are concerned that might encourage the rich to just leave France. ""There's some feeling that if Hollande is elected, the attack on the French sovereign debt could be quite serious,"" Sutton said. ""And this is what Sarkozy has been saying: 'If you elect Hollande, we're going to be losing more than our AAA. We'll be going down even further.' "" 5. Franco-American relations should remain strong. Hollande has pledged to remove French troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year if he is elected. Whether it's a realistic goal or not, that could create some tension between Paris and Washington. But Hollande is known for being a no-nonsense pragmatist. ""Hollande knows that he needs the United States and that the United States needs Europe, so I think there would be a great deal of cooperation there,"" Sutton said. Sutton recalled Mitterrand's election in 1981 and how there were initial concerns about him. ""Everyone said, 'Oh, he's got four Communists in his government, this is going to be the end of the relationship with the United States.' But it turns out that he was a very strong defender of American missiles in Germany, for example,"" Sutton said. ""Mitterrand's friendship with (Chancellor) Helmut Kohl, it was a strong French-German relationship, and (U.S. President Ronald) Reagan and Mitterrand didn't get along too badly despite their ideological differences.""","France's presidential election is set for a runoff to take place on Sunday, May 6 .

"New York (CNN) -- Before O.J. Simpson and Casey Anthony, before Scott Peterson, Amanda Knox and the cottage industry of cable news legal pundits, there was the shocking case of Jeffrey MacDonald. Ten years after his pregnant wife and two young daughters were butchered in their home in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, MacDonald was convicted of the killings and sentenced to life in prison. While a jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of MacDonald's guilt, many people were still left with one lingering question: Did he really do it? The drama surrounding the heinous crimes and the subsequent trial fascinated the public for decades. It sparked controversial best-selling books, an immensely popular television miniseries and an explosive ""60 Minutes"" interview that was watched by tens of millions of viewers. Today, more than 40 years after the murders, questions are still being raised about MacDonald's guilt. ""We've been sold a bill of goods about this case,"" said filmmaker Errol Morris. ""It's as phony as a three dollar bill."" Morris, an Academy Award-winning documentary director whose acclaimed movies include ""The Fog of War"" and ""The Thin Blue Line,"" has made that opinion the centerpiece of a new investigative book, ""A Wilderness of Error: The Trials of Jeffrey MacDonald."" At more than 500 pages, it aims to prove that an innocent man is in prison. ""The evidence is neither clear nor convincing,"" Morris told CNN. ""There are many things about this case that rub me the wrong way, but principal among them was how the jury was asked to make decisions about his guilt or innocence with incomplete evidence, evidence that was withheld, corrupted and suppressed."" Flawed forensic analysis, a contaminated crime scene, damaged and destroyed evidence and an effort to bury a confession all contributed to a miscarriage of justice, according to Morris. ""This has nagged me for so many years, ""Morris said. ""I felt I should do something."" What is not in dispute is what happened at 544 Castle Drive in the early morning hours of February 17, 1970. Military police officers responding to a call from MacDonald found his wife, Colette, beaten and stabbed to death in the master bedroom; the couple's two daughters, Kimberly, 5, and Kristen, 3, were in their beds, also stabbed to death. MacDonald, who was wounded with two stab wounds and a collapsed lung, told investigators that he was sleeping on the couch when he heard screaming. He said he awoke to find in his home three men and one woman, who he described as having blond hair and wearing a floppy hat. They were chanting ""kill the pigs"" and ""acid's groovy"" before attacking him, MacDonald told the investigators. MacDonald and his claim of killer hippies made headlines around the country. They also turned him into a prime focus of the investigation. ""The story is so bizarre and unlikely and it might actually be true,"" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It seems too preposterous on its face that a smart guy might have come up with something better, which raises the possibility that it might actually be true."" What is absolutely certain is that a military inquiry into the murders recommended MacDonald not be court-martialed, citing a lack of evidence. MacDonald was granted an honorable discharge. He moved to Southern California, where he practiced medicine. But the case against him was far from over. In 1975, a grand jury indicted MacDonald for the murders. He was ultimately convicted in 1979 and sentenced to life in prison. ""He is almost the definition of an unlikely murder suspect,"" said Toobin. ""Princeton graduate, medical doctor, Green Beret, these are the kinds of credentials we associate with people at the top of the heap in this country, not convicted murderers."" Was MacDonald the victim of injustice or a manipulative, cold-blooded killer? ""Fatal Vision,"" the 1983 book on the case by Joe McGinniss, portrayed MacDonald as a cunning sociopath. Asked to comment on ""Wilderness of Error,"" McGinniss issued the following statement to CNN: . ""Jeffrey MacDonald was convicted of the murders of his wife and two young daughters in 1979. In all the years since, every court that has considered the case -- including the United States Supreme Court -- has upheld that verdict in every aspect. MacDonald is guilty not simply beyond a reasonable doubt, but beyond any doubt."" A key figure in Morris' bid to show MacDonald is innocent is Helena Stoeckley, the woman who confessed to being in the home the night of the murders. Stoeckley, who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, and who died in 1983, testified that she had no involvement in the murders. Morris said she was encouraged by a prosecutor to alter her testimony. ""Stoeckley was crucial to the defense case because she gave us reason to believe that MacDonald was telling the truth,"" Morris said. ""But if you cut her out of the story by pressuring her to change her story, you are going to change the outcome of the trial."" James Blackburn, the prosecutor who MacDonald said threatened Stoeckley, would not comment on the charge because of pending litigation. ""I was the prosecutor in the case, and I did that job to the best of my ability,"" Blackburn told CNN. ""I did it in great reliance of the evidence the government had and we presented an honorable case and it was straightforward and it was based on good and competent evidence. And I agree with the jury's verdict."" Today, MacDonald, who will be 69 in October, still has his believers. In addition to Morris, they include Hammond A. Beale, who served as a legal adviser during the Fort Bragg military inquiry into the murders. ""I think those of us that are on the side that believes he is totally innocent can't believe this happened,"" Beale said. ""This guy has not only lost his wife and kids but loses his career and ends up in prison for the rest of his life. That's horrendous."" ""The army got it right, the federal courts royally screwed it up,"" Beale added. ""I don't think this will ever go away until justice is done."" Morris doubts the conviction will be overturned. Still, he is hopeful MacDonald will one day be freed from custody. ""It's a principle of fairness,"" Morris said. ""You don't want to convict an innocent man.""","Jeffrey MacDonald's wife and two daughters were murdered in 1970 .

"(CNN) -- A day after Sunday's 35-minute power outage during the Super Bowl game in New Orleans, officials were vowing to fix whatever the cause may have been, but no one was saying just what that was. ""We're going to work very closely with SMG to get to the root of the problem,"" said Charles Rice, president of Entergy New Orleans Inc., referring to the company that manages the dome. ""We both made excellent preparations for an event like this, and then the system worked the way it was supposed to work."" ""We've spent millions of dollars upgrading our equipment, including our electrical feeders, and we've never had this issue before,"" said Doug Thornton, an SMG executive who was in NFL control at the time of the incident. The interruption in service occurred in a substation that supplies the stadium with power, he said. A piece of equipment in the substation ""detected some abnormalities and it did what it was supposed to do -- it opened a switch, basically a breaker, which shunted the power that we were receiving from Entergy and de-energized the building."" He noted that electricians and electrical consultants were on site and pitched in immediately. A fire alarm that was hit prior to halftime appears to have had nothing to do with the outage, nor did the halftime show, Thornton said. The halftime presentation was run on generated power, ""which means it was not on our power grid at all,"" he said. Any electrical issues identified in the probe will be addressed, he promised. ""These are fixable problems,"" he said. ""Obviously, for me, it's a disappointing moment, but when you're relying on systems, it's not a human error, it's an equipment error. We'll get to the root cause of it and we'll find out what it is. It's very disappointing."" NFL Executive Vice President Eric Grubman praised the fans for remaining calm. ""They acted with the belief that the game was going to come back on, just as you or I would have acted in their seats, and that's what you and I did."" Though the investigation has just begun, ""There is no indication at all that this was caused by the halftime show, absolutely none,"" said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, referring to Beyonce's power-packed performance. ""That is not the case from anything we have at this point."" The company completed upgrades to the stadium's electrical equipment on December 21, but that may have had nothing to do with Sunday night's problem, said Entergy spokesman Philip Allison. ""Since then, we've had three major events -- the New Orleans Bowl, the Panthers-Saints game and the Sugar Bowl -- ""with no issues."" On Monday, CBS aired video shot from inside a stadium control room as the outage occurred. ""All right, we lost lights,"" says a man as the room darkened. Moments later, a man says, ""Frank, we lost the A feed."" ""What does that mean?"" he is asked. ""It means that we have to do the bus tie."" ""What does that mean?"" ""It means about a 20-minute delay."" The CEO and director of research for Zpryme, a market intelligence and analysis firm for the utility and smart grid industry, said someone appears to have made a mistake in their estimate of how much energy the building's electrical infrastructure could handle. ""Someone made that decision not to invest, saying, 'We can handle this,'"" said Jason Rodriguez. ""Come to find out that their load was just much higher than anticipated."" He continued, ""You can say it's the electrical infrastructure but, at the end of the day, there's a human component to it, a decision that had to be made."" But Bill Squires, a sports facility consultant, was not persuaded anyone was to blame. ""I would be very reluctant to ever point a finger, knowing what I know now, at an individual; I just think it was one of those things,"" he said. ""I've got to believe that those guys do the preventive maintenance."" Besides, Squires said, the outage was no more than an inconvenience. ""Nobody got hurt; everybody was safe."" And James Fama, vice president for energy delivery at the Edison Electric Institute, said the system appears to have worked well, given that the lights came back on and the circuitry was not damaged. ""The bottom line for any utility or any electric planner would be -- protect your equipment so that you can re-energize it. And it appears to be exactly what happened."" CBS, citing ratings figures from The Nielsen Company, said Sunday's game between the 49ers and the Ravens reached a total of 164.1 million viewers, making it the most-viewed show in U.S. history. Figures were tallied from 6:32 p.m. ET until 8:41 p.m. ET and from 9:11 p.m. until 10:47 p.m. The average number of viewers was put at 108.4 million, which ranked it third.","""These are fixable problems,"" says management exec .

"Tripoli (CNN) -- Libya said Tuesday that its chemical weapons, including artillery shells and bombs filled with mustard gas, have been destroyed. The destruction, completed just a few days ago, was ""an important milestone"" for Libya fulfilling its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, according to that country's Foreign Ministry. ""Libya has become totally free of usable chemical weapons that might present a potential threat to the security of the local communities, the environment and the neighboring areas,"" it said. According to Andrew C. Weber, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, the weapons destroyed were: 517 artillery shells filled with mustard gas, eight 250 kilogram bombs filled with mustard gas and 45 tubes filled with mustard gas. ""We ensure that they never fall in the hands of violent extremists, so we are preventing the potential for weapons of mass destruction terrorism,"" Weber told reporters in Tripoli. The destruction operations over the past few months were a joint effort involving Libyans trained for the tasks, with technical assistance and logistical support from the United States, Germany and Canada. The next phase will be preparations for the destruction of ""chemical precursors,"" or Category 2 chemicals, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Officials there say the destruction of chemical precursors is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.

"(CNN) -- Ukraine will compete at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games in Russia in order to promote peace between the two nations, the head of its Paralympic Committee said, although only one of the country's athletes attended Friday's opening ceremony. Relations have disintegrated following the overthrow of the Russia-friendly government in Kiev, prompting a rise in tensions in the disputed Crimea region. Ukrainian officials and Western diplomats have accused President Vladimir Putin of sending thousands of troops to Crimea in the past week -- a claim Russia denies. It had sparked fears Ukraine would boycott the 2014 Paralympic Games, which run from March 7-16, but the 23-strong team will now compete under its own flag. ""We are staying in order to be remembered, for Ukraine to be remembered as the state which sent a unified team,"" Ukraine Paralympic Committee president Valeriy Suskevich told reporters in Sochi. ""We've taken the decision to raise the flag of independent sovereign state of Ukraine here at the Paralympic Games."" Ukraine's sole representative at the opening ceremony in the Fisht Olympic stadium was Nordic skier and flag-bearer Mykailo Tkachenko. The rest of the team stayed away in protest, Ukrainian Minister of Sports and Youth, Dmitriy Bulatov, said via Facebook. ""This is how our team expresses protest against aggressors and occupants entering our land,"" Bulatov said. Suskevich urged competitors not to do anything that could further increase tensions between Russia and Ukraine, while also revealing he had spoken with Putin. ""I reiterated to Putin my request for peace during the Paralympic Games,"" he said. ""I hope I have been heard by the president of Russia. ""Do just one thing -- don't let us start a war during the Paralympic Games. We want peace. The athletes have a right to have the Paralympic Games under peaceful conditions. ""I am praying to god so that the Paralympic Games must keep peace in Europe, and my home of Ukraine. ""I could have talked at length to the president of Russia about Crimea. I could have talked a lot about conflict, I didn't have time. I realize there is exclusivity in meeting the president of Russia. ""I reiterated for Mr. Putin, emphasizing one request, that during the Paralympic Games we would have peace."" Should the military conflict deepen, however, Suskevich said Ukraine would withdraw from the Paralympics. ""I declare should this happen we will leave the Games,"" he said. ""We cannot possibly stay here in this case. ""This is what we are afraid of. This is what we are opposing and we do not want to take place. I hope my message has been heard, I hope I have been heard by the president of Russia."" Ukraine's decision to remain in Sochi and participate in the Games was welcomed by International Paralympic Committee (IPC) chairman Philip Craven. ""We are delighted as we want sport to prevail and a full complement of teams to compete in what we are confident will be a fantastic Paralympic Winter Games,"" Craven said in a statement. ""All week the IPC has been working closely with the Ukrainian Paralympic Committee in an effort to keep them here in Sochi. ""The talking point of Sochi 2014 needs to be great sport and great athletes, not global politics. ""We want all the athletes who have trained for years to reach these Games to fully focus on events on the field as opposed to off. ""Now that a decision has been taken I hope this will be the case and the athletes and the sport will take center stage and the headlines they deserve."" Ukraine will have 21 athletes competing in the para-Nordic/biathlon events, and the other two in para-alpine skiing and snowboard disciplines. It won 19 medals, five of them gold, at the 2010 Vancouver Paralympics. Only one athlete was present at the press conference, with 25-year-old biathlete Grygorii Vovchynski passionate about the chance to represent Ukraine in Sochi. ""You ask me if we are ready to compete? Yes, with the strongest desire,"" he said. ""We are ready to compete, ready to fight for Ukraine, ready to demonstrate we are a strong and free, independent people. ""We know how to love life, love sport and love fair competition.""","Ukraine will compete in the 2014 Paralympic Games in Sochi .

"(CNN) -- For a group of high-schoolers being framed for their friend's murder, the characters on ""Pretty Little Liars"" sure put a lot of thought into their outfits. It's like costume designer Mandi Line says: Why be conservative about hemlines and heel heights on a show where a teacher is dating a student and a drunk girl can't remember if she dug up her friend's dead body? ""We always go down this whole list of things every time (the producers) call me out with, 'Those heels are a little high,' "" said Line, who has worked on the ABC Family series since its first season, which premiered in 2010. Fall TV Fashion: 'Revenge' Viewers only have to wait until October 23 for the show's anticipated Halloween special. And Line says fashion lovers are in for a treat when the third season returns. Emily, the queen of simple tank tops and tees, will really step up her game; Hanna's skirts are getting a little bit shorter; Aria continues to push the envelope; and a new, top-secret storyline influences Spencer's wardrobe. But when you're dealing with characters who routinely wind up with blood on their hands -- that's literally and figuratively -- plucking looks off the runway isn't always an option. Just a few episodes ago, Hanna (Ashley Benson) was stabbed in the leg while wearing a pair of neon pink pants. Line said her team had to ""do a lot of driving"" to find at least four identical pairs for multiple scenes and takes. The blood just wouldn't have shown up as well against blue jeans, she said. ""I try not to make it inconvenient for (my team),"" Line added, though she recently had to track down five of the same $150 shirt. Hanna gets a drink spilled on her while wearing it in an upcoming episode. Line said dressing main characters Emily, Spencer, Aria and Hanna like typical high school students would be boring, adding, you can't blame viewers for ""wanting to go to some sort of fantasyland."" ""One of the things that's hilarious is that Mandi, she'll pick such amazing costumes that they're, at times, hilariously inappropriate for what we're doing,"" said Troian Bellisario, who plays Spencer on the series. ""Our school outfits are outrageous. Sometimes we're all standing together in the hallways, and we'll look around at all of our background actors who look like normal high school students. And we kind of make a joke, like, no wonder nobody talks to us in this school because we literally look so out of place."" Never mind the disconnect between the main characters and the background actors, typically clad in pieces from Forever 21 and Wet Seal, Line said. The costume designer can hardly believe Aria, Hanna, Spencer and Emily are best friends given their distinctive styles: ""I always wonder why, fashionwise, they would even talk to each other."" Bellisario, whose character Spencer dresses the preppiest of the bunch, says, ""When you start out on a TV show ... the network really wants you to have a strict character style so that at any point in the show, your character is identifiable from the back side. ... It's really important on a show with three brunettes."" But as the characters evolve, so do their styles. ""(Spencer is) not that girl you were introduced to in the argyle sweater and the pearls in the pilot,"" Line said. The one thing that has stuck with Spencer, however, is the skinny watch she always wears an inch or two above her wrist. ""At the beginning of every day, I get to walk in and somebody hands me my watch and that's how I know it's Spencer Time,"" said Bellisario. It was her idea for Spencer to wear the timepiece in the first place. And that's not the only way the actress' style has influenced her character's. ""I dislike color in general, especially pastels,"" Bellisario said. ""I think the way (Line) always compromises with me is, I love knee socks, like thigh high socks, in everyday life. And tights. And so whenever she gives me something that I'm not happy about on top, she's like, 'Look, I'll give you tights and boots.' "" Though, she said there is a bit of style envy when it comes to her costars. ""Whenever I walk into the costume fitting room, I'll see something on a rack or on the floor and I'll ooh and ahh over it,"" she said. ""And immediately Mandi will say, 'No, that's Aria's.' (Actress) Lucy (Hale) definitely, definitely has the most fun in terms of style on the show. She gets the coolest clothes."" Line said she used to think that Aria, played by Hale, was the most fashionable of the girls, but now she just considers the character to have ""schizophrenia fashion."" ""One episode is stripes, there's an episode where she's a rockabilly. And then this one she looks like a flapper. Literally, she's so inconsistent. ... The only thing that's consistent is that she wears, like, 1,000 pounds of jewelry,"" Line said. The character popped up in the summer finale wearing a metallic blue, pleated leather skirt from Topshop that Line modified. ""That's not in. But it's going to be,"" she said. ""These kids do become (fashion icons)."" And Jessica Simpson knows it. Shortly after the singer/actress/designer tweeted in June about sending the show ""some @JSCollection goodies,"" Line said she received a box with ""a crap load of stuff."" The costume designer acknowledges that many teens are likely not wearing Jeffrey Campbell wedges, Rag and Bone jeans or Vince sweaters to school, which is why she makes an effort ""to stay within some sort of a realistic price point."" "" 'Gossip Girl' put TV fashion on the map. You had 'Sex and the City' and then you had 'Gossip Girl.' But what's really good about 'Pretty Little Liars' is, 75% of the items are attainable. ... You can save up for that Free People top. You can save up for that Rachel Roy dress,"" she said. That's part of the reason she said she loves featuring Rebecca Minkoff's designs on the show. And Minkoff told CNN that the brand's unofficial partnership with the series has certainly been beneficial. During the show's second season, Minkoff said one of the characters referenced her red minibag by name. ""From there we noticed a definite uptick in sales,"" she added. Minkoff said her fall offerings include ""a lot of embossed, faux python"" handbags, ""great outerwear pieces"" and a ton of ""rich burgundy and purple"" -- so don't be surprised to see such trends show up on ""Pretty Little Liars"" this fall. Line said it didn't take her long to realize what the series was capable of, having heard from viewers who watch each episode twice: First for the plot points, and then again for the fashion. After all, it's not surprising that Line says she has ""creative freedom"" on set. Anyone who can glue craft pom poms on a brown maxiskirt from a rental house, pair it with a pink blouse and make it look fashion-forward deserves at least that much.","Mandi Line is the costume designer behind ABC Family's ""Pretty Little Liars""

"Washington (CNN) -- The moment is iconic. The lights are bright. The House chamber is buzzing. Millions of Americans are waiting to hear the state of their union. And then the voice: ""Mr. Speaker, the president of the United States."" On Tuesday night, Paul Irving will introduce President Barack Obama before his State of the Union address. But for 17 years, it was Bill Livingood whose booming voice kicked off the event with those eight words. The crowd would applaud and the president would stride into the House chamber, shaking hands and greeting members of Congress from both sides, about to fulfill an important constitutional provision. Livingood, a soft-spoken 76-year-old who retired last year, called this part of the job ""sort of not my ilk."" Livingood never expected to introduce the president when he became House sergeant at arms in 1995. Before then, the duties of announcing the president, he said, fell to the House doorkeeper. But Livingood was tapped for the honor after then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich got rid of the doorkeeper job. ""I started practicing,"" he said last week with a laugh. ""And practiced and practiced and practiced and practiced. In my office, I practiced; at home, I practiced, in the car because I didn't want to get that wrong."" Livingood had an office just off the House floor. ""The first time I did it,"" he said, ""I was concerned even though it was only eight words. So I wrote it in a piece of paper, and I kept it in my hand. The next year, I wrote it on a piece of paper, and I kept it in my pocket and from then one it was really relegated to my pocket."" He started every State of the Union address until he stepped down last year, welcoming presidents from Bill Clinton to Obama. In total, he introduced the president 20 times, including in joint sessions of Congress. At a December 2011 event honoring his career, House Speaker John Boehner reflected on Livingood's 17 years of service in the chamber. ""An example of class and humility, Bill has led us through the unthinkable,"" Boehner said. ""Bill Livingood enters the books as a good law enforcement officer, a good criminal investigator, and above all, a good and decent man. Bill, we're sorry to see you go, but on behalf of the whole House, thank you for your service."" House Minority Leader and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi also acknowledged him. ""Announcing the president at the annual State of the Union address has made Bill Livingood known in the homes of many American families, and his service of nearly 17 years, and under four different speakers of the House, puts him in the history books,"" she said in a statement. Some of the best moments of those introductions, Livingood said, occurred when he had a chance to say hello to the leader of his nation. ""Every one of them has just been unbelievable as far as being nice, and they talk to you,"" Livingood said. ""I usually say I'm glad you're here Mr. President because to me it doesn't matter who is our president."" Introducing the president is by far the most high-profile few seconds of the job, but it isn't the only duty. The sergeant at arms is the chief law enforcement officer for the House of Representatives, responsible for the overall security of the legislative body. He also is part of a three-person group that oversees the Capitol Police Board. Most of the job is behind the scenes. Livingood said he wasn't offended when people asked him what else he did on Capitol Hill. Instead, he said, he felt honored that introducing the president was so high profile. ""I think for 17 years, we are used to seeing the sergeant at arms, or me, doing it, and I hope they felt as comfortable seeing me there as I felt being with them out there,"" Livingood said. ""And it took me awhile to be comfortable ... but I really did become comfortable."" Livingood was sergeant at arms during some difficult years that included the anthrax attacks on Capitol Hill offices. He also helped reform House security systems after the September 11 attacks. Before joining the House, Livingood had a decorated career in the Secret Service for 33 years. He was protecting one of Vice President Lyndon Johnson's daughters at the time of President John F. Kennedy's assassination and was a senior adviser to three directors at the Secret Service's Office of Training. When Livingood stepped down from the job in January 2012, Irving, another Secret Service veteran, replaced him. The two are close, and Livingood talks about Irving like a proud father. ""I'm very proud of my replacement because he's outstanding and he's a good guy,"" Livingood said. ""I've known him; he came from Secret Service."" As for whether he would do it again, Livingood laughed and said his ""time has passed."" ""It's time for someone else,"" he said. ""But I really did enjoy it and that is -- I think of all the things that changed for me -- that is one thing that changed rather rapidly -- the enjoyment of it.""","For 17 years, Bill Livingood introduced the president at the State of the Union address .

"(CNN) -- The lingering smell of licorice closed several schools around Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday, nearly a month after a chemical spill that left more than a quarter million people without water. The unscheduled holidays underscore ongoing public concern about whether the water is safe to drink after a methanol compound leaked from a tank farm upstream from Charleston. Though state and federal officials tried to reassure residents this week, ""We are still getting feedback that there is a level of worry,"" said Laura Jordan, a spokeswoman for West Virginia American Water, the local water company. Jordan said the licorice odor given off by the chemical -- 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM -- is so strong that it can be picked up even if there is no detectable amount in the water. The chemical, used to clean coal to reduce ash, leaked into the Elk River and from there into Charleston's water supply on January 9. The result was a do-not-use order that left about 300,000 people in the area unable to drink or bathe in their water, some for more than a week. An elementary and high school located about 15 miles downstream from the January spill closed early Wednesday and stayed closed Thursday because of renewed complaints about the licorice smell, said Liza Cordeiro, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education. The complaints came as the schools were trying to flush their water lines to get rid of discolored water after a main broke nearby, she said. One high school student went to a hospital after complaining of burning eyes, and a teacher there was taken to the hospital after fainting, Cordeiro said. School administrators dismissed the students soon after 9 a.m., she said. Meanwhile, a grade school in Charleston was closed early Thursday after the licorice smell came out of a dishwasher, the Kanawha County School District reported. Two other schools were closed as well, the district said. Jordan said some smell and discoloration can be expected as water lines are flushed out. But she added, ""It doesn't mean there is any health risk involved."" ""We're pushing it out and getting rid of any trace,"" she said. An independent water test conducted at CNN's request found trace levels of MCHM earlier this week, both in untreated river water and in tap water from two homes in Charleston. The amounts range from less than half a part per billion to 1.6 parts per billion -- well below the safe level of 1 part per million set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Whether that level is safe has been disputed. Dr. Tanja Popovic, the director of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, told reporters Wednesday that repeated testing shows the water is safe. ""What I can say is that with all the scientific evidence that we have, with everything that numerous people have worked on so far, I can say that you can use your water however you like,"" Popovic said. ""You can drink it, you can bathe in it, you can use it how you like."" And Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said tests have shown levels of less than 10 parts per billion or too low to detect. Tomblin said he and his staff have been drinking the water ""for the last couple of weeks."" But when asked whether he could declare it ""100% safe,"" he said, ""No."" ""The only thing that we can rely upon is what the experts tell us, and, you know, for all the tests done that's who we've got to depend upon,"" he said. A federal grand jury is probing the spill at Freedom Industries, the storage facility at the source of leak, sources familiar with the grand jury's activities told CNN this week. The spill was originally estimated at about 7,500 gallons, but Freedom Industries reported in late January that about 10,000 gallons of chemical had escaped. The company also told regulators that in addition to the methanol compound that escaped from a ruptured tank, a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers, known as PPH -- was part of the leak. PPH is not believed to pose any new health hazard for the people of Charleston,but the state environmental agency said failing to accurately report the makeup of the leak is a violation of state law. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","Lingering concerns after a January chemical spill close West Virginia schools .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Lust, love and like. A healthful, happy love relationship serves up three out of three. A healthful, happy love relationship is a passionate best friendship. Modern women could learn a few things about love and seduction from Scheherazade. Many women think men only care about the lust angle -- finding a hot bod for hot sex. Unfortunately, there are many men who do only care about this. In my book ""Prince Harming Syndrome,"" I explain how relationships that are too focused on sex wind up being what my favorite philosopher buddy Aristotle called a relationship of pleasure -- where you find a sex-mate or a relationship of utility -- where you find an ego-mate or wallet-mate. However, a healthful, happy love relationship is what Aristotle calls a relationship of shared virtue -- when you find a soul mate. Where you each get one another at your core, inspire and support each other to grow into your best possible selves. A relationship of shared virtue is where you feel the whole triumvirate: lust, love and like. Meaning? If you want to fully seduce a man, then you've got to know how to grab a man by more than his you-know-what. You must truly turn on a man's soul! Oprah.com: 5 things that make you sexy . If you sleep with a man before you feel safe knowing you connect on a soul-to-soul level, the relationship might start off hot -- but like steam into air, it will rise quickly then -- pfffft -- vanish into vapor. Or worse, you'll wind up getting burnt. This is so important to prioritize, that I'm repeating this reminder in bold italic letters: If you can't stimulate a man in more areas than from the waist down, you will only be attracting a relationship of pleasure or a relationship of utility. And this man will not remain your man for long. One of my favorite quotes about love comes from the book ""The Little Prince"": ""It's only with the heart that one can see rightly; what's most important is invisible to the eye."" I love that the Little Prince recognized that the heart (another metaphysical word for soul) is the best lens for love -- making this Little Prince a major Prince Charming. Seduction Tip 1 (in bold italics so you recognize it is crucial to remember): If you want to be a man's Princess Charming, you MUST do more than work on tightening your buns or boosting up your boobs! You MUST tap into what I call ""The Scheherazade Effect."" Oprah.com: What to do before you can find love . Remember the tale of Scheherazade and her 1,001 nights? Scheherazade was absolutely a Princess Charming who knew how to grab and stimulate her king's soul. Voilà! The CliffsNotes on Scheherazade: . There once was a king who got very bored with the women in his life very quickly. He would marry a new virgin, ""shtup"" her, then send her pretty self away pretty much immediately... to be beheaded. Talk about a bad breakup, huh? And talk about a King Harming, huh? Anyway, this king killed thousands of women by the time he finally met the enchantingly different Scheherazade. What made Scheherazade enchantingly different? Scheherazade loved to read books and had lots of fascinating ideas and interests to share. Wisely educated in morality and kindness, she had a passion for poetry, philosophy, sciences and arts. She kept the king on the edge of his bed -- not with mere alluring sexual positions -- but with alluring stories to be told, each more exciting than the next. And so the king kept Scheherazade alive -- eagerly anticipating each new tale -- until, lo and behold, 1,001 adventurous nights passed -- along with three sons -- and the king not only learned to love Scheherazade, but he made her his queen. Talk about living happily ever after, huh? The lesson learned? It's very seductive to a man when you, as a full-bodied and full souled woman, have passions in your life you can share to keep him inspired, titillated, growing and thriving. Seduction Tip 2 (again in bold italics so you recognize it is crucial to remember): The more passions you have in your life, the more passion your man will have for you! Oprah.com: 4 steps to finding your passion . My friend David told me he fell in love with his wonderful wife of 13 years because he adored her ""world lens"" -- all the interesting perspectives she shared about life, all her passionate insights and enthusiastic talents. David's idea of love is being turned on by how his paramour looked at the world, instead of simply focusing on how she looked to the world. Which is why David is a 3-D Prince Charming who's found his Scheherazade. Unfortunately, I believe too many women feel that the best way to catch a guy is with the bait of their (to word it politely) ""vajayjay."" But if that is the main lure for love, then why aren't little ""vajayjay icons"" found on Valentine's Day cards? I'm kidding -- but I am serious! If you sleep with a man too soon, you risk being dizzied by an ""oxytocin high,"" and you will not know until you're already emotionally entrenched if the two of you have a true soul-nurturing connection. Plus, even in this modern world, you also risk the man respecting you less if you give sex away too quickly. It's timeless psychology. The harder you are to win, the bigger your estimated prize value. Many men do not want to belong to a club that has touched their members too quickly. It's the ol' Dr. Ejaculate/Mr. Hide Syndrome. As soon as the man comes, he'll want to go. Seduction Tip 3 (back to bold italics one last time for good measure): If you ever wanna hear ""I do,"" you have to start off saying a lot of sexual ""I don'ts."" For this reason, I recommend to the women I coach that they do not drink alcohol on dates. Staying alcohol-free will help ensure you clearly ""hear"" who a guy is, not simply ""see"" who he is. You don't want to be hypnotized by superficial qualities, like his looks and wealth. Plus, being alcohol-free will help make sure you don't move too swiftly forward physically (a.k.a. it will ensure you keep your vajayjay in your skirt!). Meaning? My overall big seduction tip for luring in healthful, happy relationship is to STOP trying to be seductive! If you focus too much on seducing a man with your body and beauty, you will only be luring in a man with your body and beauty. If you want to wisely be in a lust, love and like relationship of shared virtue, it's far more important that you excite a man's soul. Oprah.com: How to get lucky in love and life .

"(CNN) -- A Virginia grand jury indicted six Colombian nationals Thursday for the kidnapping and murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent in the South American country during an attempted robbery last month, federal authorities said. Special Agent James ""Terry"" Watson died after being stabbed in a taxi in Bogota, Colombia, on June 20. He was assigned to the DEA unit in Cartagena and was on temporary duty in Bogota. The six defendants operated a robbery and kidnapping conspiracy using cabs in Bogota to lure victims, and the driver of the cab would signal to conspirators to commence the abduction and robbery, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement. Watson was allegedly shocked with a stun gun by one defendant and stabbed with a knife by another defendant, the Justice Department said. 10 things to know before visiting Colombia . Watson, 42, had been watching the last game of the NBA finals at a Bogota restaurant at night and left in a taxi, a State Department spokesman said last month. Investigators believe Watson's cab stopped at a traffic light and his assailants jumped out of two other cabs, which pulled up on either side of the vehicle in which he was riding, a law enforcement official said. According to the official, Watson managed to escape from the cab and was taken to a hospital, where he died. In Colombia, such attacks are known as ""millionaire rides."" Authorities said the suspects they arrested were part of a gang known for millionaire ride robberies. The DEA said Watson was a 13-year veteran of the agency. He had been sent to Afghanistan three times on counternarcotics trafficking assignments and had previously served in the Army and worked for the U.S. Marshals Service. The indictment sends ""an unmistakable message to all who commit acts of violence against America's law enforcement professionals: no matter who you are or where you live, we will do everything in our power to hold you accountable to the fullest extent of the law,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. Indicted were: . -- Gerardo Figueroa Sepulveda, 38. -- Omar Fabian Valdes Gualtero, 27. -- Edgar Javier Bello Murillo, 26. -- Hector Leonardo Lopez, 23. -- Julio Estiven Gracia Ramierez, 30. -- AndrÃ©s Alvaro Oviedo-Garcia, 21. Each of them was charged with two counts of second-degree murder, one count of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy to kidnap. Oviedo-Garcia was also charged with two counts of assault. The federal grand jury in Virginia also indicted Wilson Daniel Peralta-Bocachica, 30, a Colombian national, for his allegedly trying to destroy evidence in Watson's murder, the Justice Department said.col TV reported. The United States will request extradition of the suspects, but it has not yet done so formally, a law enforcement official said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The lesbian daughter of a Hong Kong tycoon who has offered millions of dollars to any man who can win her heart is asking him to come to terms with her sexuality. ""As your daughter, I would want nothing more than to make you happy,"" Gigi Chao writes to her father, Cecil, in an open letter published Wednesday in two local newspapers. ""But in terms of relationships, your expectations of me and the reality of who I am, are not coherent."" Cecil Chao, a wealthy real estate developer, made headlines around the world in 2012 when he offered 500 million Hong Kong dollars (roughly $65 million) to any man who succeeded in marrying his daughter. The only requirement is that the man ""loves my daughter, and she loves him,"" he said at the time. He proposed the multimillion dollar dowry after it emerged that Gigi Chao and her longtime female partner, Sean Eav, had their relationship blessed in a church ceremony in Paris. His refusal to accept the relationship leaped back into the news in Hong Kong this month after a Malaysian newspaper that interviewed him reported that he might be willing to double his dowry offer. Men are 'just not for me' The renewed media glare appears to have prompted Gigi Chao, 34, to pen her heartfelt letter. She confirmed to CNN that she wrote it. ""I am sorry that people have been saying insensitive things about you lately,"" she writes to her father, stressing that she ""will always forgive you for thinking the way you do, because I know you think you are acting in my best interests."" She says she takes responsibility for some of her father's misplaced expectations. When he first announced the huge dowry in 2012, she said at the time she found it ""quite entertaining."" But now she appears to be setting the record straight. ""I'm sorry to mislead you to think I was only in a lesbian relationship because there was a shortage of good, suitable men in Hong Kong,"" she writes. ""There are plenty of good men, they are just not for me."" Plea to accept partner . She says that she felt ""an indescribable discomfort"" in the presence of boyfriends she had in the past. But with 46-year-old Eav, she says she is ""comfortable and satisfied with my life and completely at ease with her."" Her 77-year-old father has never married, earning a reputation for appearing on the pages of local newspapers and magazines in the arms of beautiful women. He once reportedly bragged of having had 10,000 girlfriends. Gigi Chao says in her letter that she regrets that her father has ""no idea how happy I am with my life."" She also urges him to try to accept her female partner. ""It would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her, and treat her like a normal, dignified human being,"" she writes. CNN's Anjali Tsui and Tim Schwarz contributed to this report.","Gigi Chao writes an open letter to her father that is published in local papers .

"(CNN) -- Plenty of people who feel no inclination to schuss or slide or Salchow are faithful fans of the Winter Olympic Games. For them, we present this list of sites and activities at former Winter Olympic venues. You won't need skis or skates -- you don't even have to feel the cold wind against your skin -- to show your appreciation for the athletes or to experience just a bit of what they must have felt when competing at the Winter Olympic Games. Chamonix, France (1924) More than 10,000 paying spectators came to watch 11 women and 247 men compete in ice hockey, figure skating, speed skating, bobsleighing, curling, Nordic (cross-country) skiing and ski jumping at Chamonix Winter Sports Week 90 years ago. It wasn't until after the event proved to be such a success that it became known as the ""first"" Winter Olympic Games. Although few reminders of those games remain, the Alpine Museum in Chamonix houses some mementos, and the Catholic Church Ãˆglise Saint-Michel Ã  Chamonix commemorates the region's Olympic heritage with a stained glass window featuring skiers and a bobsleigh. And this charming alpine village near Mont Blanc -- the ""roof of Europe"" -- still offers a world-class winter experience to athletes and bar-hoppers alike. Photos: Remnants of glory in former Olympic cities . St. Moritz, Switzerland (1928 and 1948) When 15-year-old Norwegian figure skating sensation Sonja Henie performed her gold-medal-winning routine on the ice rink outside the Badrutt family's Kulm Hotel in 1928, the location couldn't have been more appropriate. In 1864, hotelier Johannes Badrutt turned St. Moritz into a winter vacation destination by convincing his summertime guests that they'd enjoy the Swiss Alps just as much in winter. Sportsman Alphonse Badrutt supported construction of the natural ice St. Moritz-Celerina bobsleigh run. And Johannes' grandson, Hans, was a member of the executive committees that brought the 1928 games to St. Moritz. The Kulm and Badrutt's Palace hotels are still St. Moritz landmarks, as is the St. Moritz-Celerina bobsleigh run, which is open to guest riders when it's not being used by Olympians-in-training. Sochi hotels report construction delays . Lake Placid, New York (1932 and 1980) Although Lake Placid hosted the games in 1932, it is most remembered for the U.S. athletes' performances at the 1980 Winter Olympic Games -- especially the U.S. men's ice hockey team's ""Miracle on Ice"" victory over the heavily favored Soviet team followed by their gold-medal win over Finland and Eric Heiden's unprecedented five gold medals in speed skating. That historic speed-skating oval stands just outside the Lake Placid Olympic Center, which houses a small museum and the hockey arena now dedicated to coach Herb Brooks. The whole Whiteface and Mount Van Hoevenberg area remains a top-level training ground for future Olympians; and if you're feeling adventurous, the Lake Placid Bobsled Experience lets you try out the track they still use today for their training. Sochi 2014: Russia's numbers game . Oslo, Norway (1952) It sometimes seems as if the Olympic Winter Games were created to remind the world just how many outstanding winter athletes come from Norway. (No country has won more medals in the Winter Olympic Games.) So when you're in Oslo, it's no surprise that the Holmenkollen ski jump is still the biggest thing in town. Ski jumping has been part of the action here since 1892, and the jump has been redeveloped more than a dozen times. The latest structure, which opened in 2010, is made of steel and stretches nearly 97 meters (318 feet). The Ski Simulator at the top of the hill is a virtual reality experience that will leave you breathless and more awestruck by ski-jumpers than ever. The arena next to the ski jump was used for cross-country skiing and biathlon competitions in 1952, and might be again should Oslo win its bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Blood Falls and other natural oddities . Innsbruck, Austria (1964 and 1976) The Tyrolean Alps were a picture-perfect backdrop for Olympic skiing competition in 1976 as Austrian favorite Franz Klammer seemed to gobble up the terrain on his way to a gold medal in the men's downhill and West Germany's Rosi Mittermaier took two golds and a silver in the women's downhill and slalom events. You'll want more than the 1 minute 45 seconds or so that Klammer and Mittermaier spent on the mountain. Take your time to soak in the scenery on an evening lantern hike that takes you past the Olympic ski slopes and ends with singing and beverages at a friendly inn. Sapporo, Japan (1972) The double lift takes just five minutes to carry you to the top of the Okurayama 90-meter ski jump hill where, in 1972, 19-year-old Wojciech Fortuna became the first and only Polish man to win an Olympic ski-jumping gold medal. (In 1972, transport to the top took 20 minutes; the trip down for Fortuna, less than 20 seconds.) The viewing lounge at 300 meters allows you to peer down at the city and at the ski jump starting line. At the Sapporo Winter Sports Museum, simulators in the ""Sensation/Experience Zone"" replicate the ski jump experience. Calgary, Canada (1988) The Olympic spirit has never left Calgary, where Katarina Witt won a gold medal in figure skating for East Germany and curling resurfaced as a demonstration sport after an absence of more than 50 years. In addition to marking the Olympic debut of American speed skater Bonnie Blair, the Calgary Olympics also introduced the world to the Jamaican Bobsleigh Team (later immortalized in the 1993 film ""Cool Runnings""). Today, visitors with just slightly less bobsleigh training than those four gentlemen can slide down the very same track at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour (120 km/h) in a bobsleigh driven by a professional pilot. In summer, you can do the run in a bobsleigh on wheels or zip-line down the mountain from the 90-meter ski jump. Albertville, France (1992) At the Albertville games, the newly unified German team included singles luger Georg Hackl in his second of what would be five Olympic games winning his first of three gold medals. Today, as a visitor, you can come as close as you'll ever come to his experience on the speed luge at the La Plagne Olympic bobsleigh track -- a one-person luge that reaches speeds up to 55 miles per hour (89 kph). Or rub elbows with an Olympian at a more relaxed pace at Le Chalet d'Eleonore in Les Saisies, an alpine-style bed and breakfast run by former Olympic skier Leila Piccard. (Her brother Franck, a gold medalist in the Super-G at the Calgary Games, works at the Les Saisies ski resort.) Salt Lake City, Utah (2002) Guided tours of Utah Olympic Park near Park City reveal some ""backstage"" secrets about the Olympic events and visit some memorable spots, such as the ski jump where 20-year-old Simon Ammann from Switzerland was a surprise gold-medal winner and undisputed crowd-pleaser in the K90 Individual and K120 individual events. At the Alf Engen Ski Museum, you can find out more about the region's Olympic skiing past, present and future, including an exhibition on the U.S. women's ski jumping team, which will compete for the first time in Olympic history at Sochi. After taking a look at the Olympic medals in the museum's collection, head back to Salt Lake City and Olympic Cauldron Park where the medal ceremonies took place. Vancouver, Canada (2010) Many venues from the 2010 Olympic Winter Games have been smoothly integrated or reintegrated into the Vancouver landscape. BC Place, site of the opening and closing ceremonies, is back to being the home of the BC Lions (CFL) and Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS) and hockey venue Rogers Arena remains the home of the NHL Vancouver Canucks. The Olympic cauldron stands outside the Vancouver Convention Centre. The Richmond Olympic Oval, where Dutch speed skater Sven Kramer set new Olympic records in the 5,000 and 10,000 meter races, is now a public skating rink, community center and future site of the interactive Richmond Olympic Experience, expected to open in late 2014. While there are Olympic sites throughout the area, you might find yourself closest to your athletic dreams if you spend the night at the HI-Whistler Hostel, originally part of the Athlete's Village.","Winter Olympics venues past offer speed thrills to less competitive visitors .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Six students were wounded when unknown assailants tossed a hand grenade into a school in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, hospital staff said Wednesday. The blast occurred during break time at the Mahd al-Maarefa school. In a statement on its Facebook page, Benghazi's al-Jalaa hospital said it had received the students, some of them between the ages of 13 and 17. It quoted a student as saying the hand grenade was thrown into the school from outside its walls, injuring students in the legs. Blasts and assassinations are not uncommon in Benghazi, the cradle of Libya's 2011 uprising and where U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in an attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in September 2012. But they have mainly targeted security officials. Attacks on schools are rare. Two and a half years after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's weak authorities are struggling to impose order and control heavily armed former rebels, militias and militants who fought to oust the dictator. Militia brigades often take the law into their own hands as they fight turf wars, and they have refused to lay down their weapons.","Assailants threw a hand grenade into a school in Benghazi .

"(CNN) -- Last week our nation turned with grief to Prescott, Arizona, where 19 members of an elite firefighting squad perished in a raging wildfire. The media coverage of the tragedy has highlighted the dedication the men had to their work, to each other and to the families they left behind. What makes all of this coverage especially poignant is that, as early as this week, the names and heroic stories of these men might disappear from the headlines and fade from the public's memory. For one thing, there are new tragedies: The plane crash in San Francisco that killed two people and injured countless others, the air taxi crash in Alaska that killed 10 passengers and the horrific train derailment and explosion in Canada. 'I miss my brothers': Survivor pays tribute at Arizona firefighters . While these new accidents joust for our attention, how can we ensure that the memories of the firefighters, or the victims of the crashes, remain salient in our minds? It's a question with important real-world implications. After all, it is the lasting psychological impact of a tragedy that often determines whether the public will take positive, constructive steps in its wake, like donating money to support the victims' families or pressuring officials to determine what went wrong, in order to prevent another tragedy like it. While we don't have all the answers, psychological research has started to identify how stories like those of Prescott's Granite Mountain Hotshots can inspire appropriate action and not just become forgotten. Feeling an emotional connection to a victim matters -- a lot. Studies suggest that feeling an emotional connection to one person does far more to stoke compassion than the cool rationality of numbers and statistics. In one eye-opening experiment, for instance, researchers Deborah A. Small, George Loewenstein and Paul Slovic found that people who read the story of a single, starving African girl donated more to an anti-hunger charity than did people who read an appeal featuring statistics on starvation in Africa. What's even more astounding: The people who read the story didn't only donate more than the people who read the statistics; they also donated more than the people confronted with the statistics combined with the girl's story. This suggests not only that an individual's story matters more than impressive statistics but that numbers actually stunt our compassionate instincts, perhaps because they make us feel overwhelmed and hinder our ability to identify with another human being. Moreover, it's easier to foster an emotional connection to a single person in need than to a group, even a small group. A study by Israeli researchers found that people donated more money to help a single sick child than to a group of eight sick kids, even though the single kid and the eight kids were all identified in the same way, with their name, age and photo. Opinion: When heroes face down fire -- and fate . News reports emphasizing the high number of casualties among the Granite Mountain Hotshots, such as by pointing out that these 19 lives are the most any fire department in the United States has lost on a single day since September 11, might actually be making their story stick less in the public's consciousness. Instead of trying to weave personal details about several of the fallen firefighters into a single story, news reports might be more effective if they focus on just one of the men at a time, including his photo and meaningful personal details. We're also more likely to care about a victim when we recognize something specific that we have in common with that person. Studies have found that people are more likely to demonstrate kindness and generosity toward others of the same race or ethnicity, as well as toward people who share their taste in art, root for their favorite sports team or have the same birthday. This hit close to home when I first read about the Granite Mountain Hotshots. When I saw the name of the team's supervisor, Eric Marsh, who died in the fire, I could feel my interest in the story perk up, and I'll admit that I found myself scanning the rest of the article for a photo or more details about Marsh, solely because we shared the same last name. I knew we weren't related, but that simple connection deepened my personal investment in the tragedy. The lesson here seems clear: The more that stories reveal specific details about a victim, the greater the chance that they'll help us see ourselves in that person and elicit our compassion. Supporting the families of the fallen . Finally, images also seem to be critical. In that Israeli study, when people were given the chance to help either an anonymous sick child or a sick child identified by her name and age, the donation amounts hardly differed. But when a photo was added to the sick child's profile, donations for her medical care shot up dramatically. In this light, releasing photos of the Granite Mountain Hotshots might help their story resonate with the public. But as we've seen many times in the past, particularly with September 11 and Hurricane Katrina, stories often strike the deepest chord when they feature both photos of the victims and images of the tragedy that overtook them. None of this is exact science. The place of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, and others like the plane crash victims, in our hearts and minds will depend on a host of factors, including whether they're overshadowed by subsequent domestic and international events. While these tragedies are still in our thoughts, perhaps the lessons from science can help us honor the victims with compassion and respect, and, in the process, prevent similar tragedies in the future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Marsh.","The 19 brave firefighters who died in an Arizona blaze may fade soon from memory .

"(EW.com) -- Elisabeth Moss is having quite the year: She won a Golden Globe for her performance in the mini-series Top of the Lake, she's co-starring in the final season of Mad Men beginning this spring, and now, she's on the cover of this week's New York magazine. Moss comes off as a Cool Girl in the New York profile, talking about how normal she is — she watches a lot of TV! she has two cats! she loves iPhone games! — and also touching on some less-normal topics, like her ties with Scientology and her relationship with Fred Armisen. We rounded up the highlights below: . She's a jokester on set — until it's showtime . While filming The One I Love, a romantic comedy (with a twist) that premiered at Sundance this year, Moss's microphone had to be moved because it was picking up the sound of her heartbeat. ""She's joking around casually and then you yell 'Action' and her heartbeat goes to 150 beats per minute,"" says co-star Mark Duplass. Helen Mirren's a fan . Moss introduced herself to Dame Mirren when they sat at the same table at this year's Golden Globes, to which Mirren replied: ""I know who the f— you are."" Safe to say Moss has made it. The cast of Mad Men play iPhone games in their off-time . Moss and her costars get along a lot better than their characters do on the show, apparently — so much so that Moss and co. tend to stick around after filming to hang out in what they call the set's ""base camp,"" an area by the hair and makeup trailers that acts as a sort of living room for the cast. There, they play Heads Up!, a game in which Moss excels. She's lazy . ""I don't go to classes. I hate hiking. I don't go to flea markets. I would like to do that stuff but I just don't do that stuff. I was like, 'I guess we'll go to the beach, because that's something I would do if I had time and wasn't so lazy?'"" Moss says as she and New York's reporter drive to the beach. But she does like watching shows like Scandal and Nashville in her free time — a woman after our own heart! She doesn't want to talk to you about Scientology . Her affiliation with the church is well-known, but she's done addressing it — even to her friends. ""I said what it meant to me, and anyone can go and look at that if they want to know what I feel. But now it's private, off limits."" Fred Armisen was... not the best husband . ""It was extremely traumatic and awful and horrible,"" Moss says of her marriage to the comedian, which lasted eight months.(The couple separated in 2010.) ""At the same time, it turned out for the best. I'm glad that I'm not there. I'm glad that it didn't happen when I was 50. I'm glad I didn't have kids. And I got that out of the way. Hopefully.

"(CNN) -- Japan's government is to allow some residents around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant to return to their homes to live for the first time since the March, 2011 disaster. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated and a 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone declared around the plant after a devastating earthquake and tsunami triggered a reactor meltdown -- the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986 -- causing high levels of radioactive contamination. Once bustling communities in this pocket of eastern Japan were turned into ghost towns. Google Street View maps Fukushima nuclear ghost town . But on April 1, some 350 people from the Miyakoji district of Tamura city will be allowed to head back to their homes permanently, according to the country's Reconstruction Agency. Some 31,000 people could eventually return home, it added. The government says about 138,000 Fukushima residents are still living in temporary accommodation. At a meeting Sunday, Miyakoji residents were told that radiation contamination levels had lowered sufficiently for their return to the area -- though some voiced concern over existing radiation levels despite decontamination efforts around some communities. Life goes on despite uncertainty in Fukushima region . Areas are declared suitable for habitation if residents are exposed to a maximum of 20 millisieverts of radiation per year. Officials have said they would like to get radiation exposure down to one millisievert a year. Fukushima leaks . The containment effort at the wrecked Fukushima-Daichi plant has been beset by problems, with regular reports of leaks of contaminated material. Last week, an estimated 100 metric tons of highly contaminated water flowed over a barrier around a containment tank and is being absorbed into the ground, plant operators, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), said in a statement -- though it denied there was any leakage into the nearby Pacific Ocean. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government vowed to step in to deal with the toxic water crisis at the plant that caused concern in Japan and abroad about the scale of the problem faced by TEPCO. The leak reported Thursday is one of the largest since TEPCO reported last summer that about 300 tons of radioactive water had leaked from a tank.

"(CNN) -- It's just water. Of course it is frozen in the form of ice. Driving on ice is a fool's errand. On ice it is hard to stop (or start) moving. On ice, vehicle control is difficult at best. You don't need to be a transportation engineer to know that crashes increase with snow and especially ice, with its reduced friction. The problem is not that Atlanta got snow, but that the snow turned into ice. Should Atlanta have been better prepared? In retrospect, the answer is obvious. In prospect it should have been as well. While it's hot in the summer, Atlanta is in the foothills of the Appalachians, not the beaches of the Caribbean. In the past eight decades, it has snowed 4 inches or more 11 times in Atlanta. There are periodic ice storms. According to Weatherspark,  the average low temperature in January is 34 degrees F, just above freezing. In other words, half the time in January the daytime low is below 34. I lived in Atlanta for five years. As a freshman, I remember a cold spell in January 1985, when Ronald Reagan's second inauguration was canceled in Washington because of cold, and Georgia Tech, where I was a student, had a delayed opening because it was 8 degrees. So winter is something that leaders should be aware of in Georgia. Atlanta does not get as much snow as Minneapolis, my current home, and where we have stared down a polar vortex, and are now blanketed with about 2 feet of snow. Atlanta is certainly not as cold as Minneapolis, where unusually, school was canceled two days this week, and five days this school year, and we now look at ice planet Hoth (where Luke Skywalker and friends were based at the opening of ""The Empire Strikes Back"") as an improvement. But Atlanta still experiences winter. Atlanta still has access to forecasts from the National Weather Service. This storm was not a surprise. There are several strategies for dealing with ice storms. Officials could have tried to prevent the ice. Unfortunately weather control is not yet very practical. The city and state could have tried to mitigate the ice. There are many techniques for salting and sanding roads that either prevent ice from forming, melt the ice or make it easier to travel on ice. This requires a fleet of vehicles and drivers that are prepared well before the weather event and that continue to be deployed until the roads are cleared. The risk is the city and state spend money on preparations for bad weather that does not come. Such spending is standard operating procedure in northern cities such as Minneapolis, where snow and ice are almost guaranteed, but it may not be worthwhile if the ice is infrequent. Opinion: When 2.6 inches of snow made hell freeze over . Atlanta could have tried to avoid the ice. If officials knew ice was coming (and they should have, the weather forecasts were not highly guarded state secrets), they should have canceled schools and encouraged people to stay home. The risk is you cancel school and it only rains, or the storm changes course. Officials who cancel school, only to see the weather improve, look bad, are considered ""fraidy-cats,"" will be mocked by talking heads and Monday morning quarterbacks, and more importantly will have a harder time making the right decision the next time. A real leader is not so insecure. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned his city about Sandy despite perhaps being (in retrospect) too conservative in his warnings about Irene. In the end, we should ask: Is missing a day of school, or working from home instead of the office really the end of the world? Instead what officials in Georgia did was accept the damage (in the form of traffic congestion, crashes, people sleeping in place in their cars and schools instead of at home) caused by the ice. This outcome required no advance preparation or forethought. In fact a debacle of this magnitude required a careful absence of preparation. Worse, everything shut down at once. Dismissals were not coordinated, exacerbating congestion. In the end though, the main problem was not that everyone left work and school at the same time. The problem was they were all there in the first place. In the long term, the Atlanta area could do much more to avoid its routine congestion. But in the short term, if you cannot prevent the special congestion caused by the weather, avoid it. Is weather getting weirder? I don't know. Is weather getting more predictable? Most definitely. The science is improving, and the measurements are getting more precise, and there are many more of them, all of which make short-range forecasts very accurate. Our politicians should listen to the scientists sometimes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Levinson.","David Levinson: Atlanta area should have been prepared for the weather .

"Santa Barbara, California (CNN) -- I first heard of Dream Foundation in 1997 when the charity requested a visit to Graceland for a dream recipient. After the visit, I received a thank-you note and photo of the dreamer in front of the Graceland gates. I was moved by her experience and decided I wanted to get more involved, so I picked up the phone to find out more about the foundation. I was absolutely mesmerized and instantly attached to their unique mission of granting wishes to adults with terminal illnesses. When I was asked to be an ambassador and spokeswoman for the charity, I couldn't say yes fast enough. How could I turn down such a great cause? I've been honored to travel and represent the organization across the country at special events and corporate meetings, as well as in public service announcements, television and print interviews. But the best part of my ""job"" is seeing the hands-on attention and care we give to the people we serve. There's a common misperception that all the dreams we fulfill are for grand vacations. But many requests are profoundly basic: Pay a utility bill, or provide mobility with a scooter. No matter the scale of the dream -- whether it's a peaceful escape to the beach, a long-delayed family reunion or an appliance that works -- every one is touching and heartwarming because it unites people. Dreams provide comfort and closure, not only to the recipients, but to their family members as well. Ill parents often want nothing more than to see their kids smiling and having fun again. In turn, these dreams also give children an opportunity to see their parents happy, carefree and outside of the hospital's sterile environment. One dreamer really stands out in my mind: Helena, a young girl of 23 with cancer. She had a beautiful voice and wanted to be a singer. The Dream Foundation contacted Grammy award-winning songwriter Diane Warren and got permission for Helena to record a song in Diane's studio. When Helena played the recording back, it was heartwarming to see her smile and be so full of joy. The song not only made Helena happy, but her family happy as well, knowing her dream had been fulfilled. How can you beat that? After Helena passed, her husband was left with that precious recording to help remember her by. To this day, he still calls and thanks the Dream Foundation for granting his wife's wish. I've been blessed to work with Dream Foundation. The organization has impacted me in so many ways. I think when you see and experience someone's dream with them, it lives on within you. It's life-changing. We all have problems, but we have to stop thinking of ourselves and focus on the bigger picture. There are people suffering all over the world, and we can make life a little bit better -- even if only for a moment -- one dream at a time.","Dream Foundation grants wishes to terminally ill people 18 years and older .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When you are next in the lobby of a Westin hotel in North America, take a deep breath. It may not hit you at first, but if you're careful you should detect a hint of geranium or a note of freesia. Branded scents of flowers are becoming a common feature in hotel lobbies . The fragrance is part of the hotel chain's attempt to elevate the senses, transform the space and, above all, create a memorable experience for its guest. Westin are not alone in this approach. Other business travel environments including business class lounges and planes are filling their air with branded scents as companies cash in on the power of smell as a marketing tool. The idea is that the sense of smell is closely linked to the part of the brain that controls both emotion and memory. In fact, three quarters of our day-to-day emotions are thought to be influenced by what we smell. Brands for decades have created logos, and relied on their repeated use to build a visual association, and with that brand loyalty and engagement. But as Simon Harrop, executive director of Brand Sense Agency (that is spearheading the concept of sensory branding) says, vision goes to the part of the brain that controls rational thought. ""This means we tend to override the signals,"" he says. ""But because smell goes to the part of the brain linked to emotion, it creates a more direct and powerful response. If we can create associations with a fragrance, then it becomes a very powerful way to enhance the brand."" Using smell as a branding technique is not new. Since the 1990s, Singapore Airlines has been using its own fragrance, known as Stefan Florida Waters. Flight attendants wear it as perfume, it is blended into the hot towels served before take-off and it wafts through the cabin during the flight. As outlined in the book Brand Sense my Martin Lindstrom, also MD of Brand Sense Agency, you may not necessarily remember the smell, but as soon as you step into the aircraft it has the ""potential to kick-start a kaleidoscope of smooth, comfortable memories, all reflecting the more obvious customer service and quality efforts of the Singapore Airlines brand."" Harrop also founded The Aroma Co that specializes in providing aromatic solutions in marketing. Seven or eight years ago he worked with British Airways to develop a fragrance for seven the airline's business class lounges. The idea was to bring ""the outdoors in"", says Harrop, through the use of smell of running water. Unfortunately, this work coincided with British Airway's tail re-branding exercise and the smell was literally drowned out. Other smells have lingered, however. Retailers and food service companies are increasingly using it as a technique and Starwood Hotels has pumping smells into its 400 Sheraton and 125 Westin Hotels & Resorts for over 18 months. Amalie Craig, UK spokesperson for Starwood says the scent in the Westin hotels has proved a hit with guests. As a result, they have now created their own line of candles and potpourris so guests can take the smell home with them. ""Hundreds of guests asked how to purchase the scent for their home prompting a waiting list for the exclusive collection months before its debut,"" she says. But for those who might have thought existing advertising techniques were sinister enough, this new multi-sensory approach may really get up your nose. Literally. Others have been concerned about the overuse of chemicals and the risk of exacerbating allergies. (Starwood says its smells are natural and hypoallergenic). Other critics say smells are simply obtrusive. But Harrop is not deterred. This is not about bombarding people with a smell, he says. ""We are talking one or two parts of fragrance per billion molecules of air. Humans can detect tiny amount of air, so it should be done very subtly."" And after all, he adds, when you go into a business lounge it's going to smell of something. So rather than the whiff of a take-away burger or a sweaty traveller create the emotional response, why not use something a bit more refreshing?

"Washington (CNN) -- Prime shopping season might be underway this holiday season, but candidate shopping might be a little easier for voters next campaign season. Melissa Yasinow, 28, was born and raised in suburban Cleveland Heights, Ohio, which has a population of about 46,000 people. Yasinow is so vested in her town that she decided to run for city council. To help her run her campaign, she enlisted family and friends. Yasinow did what any serious candidate would do. She engaged voters, planned and hosted campaign events and solidified a platform. It was a tall order for her and her loyal team of helpers who all simultaneously held down full time jobs. But she had checked all the boxes of a traditional campaign. She ultimately won, but an aspect of modern campaigning was missing and not within her reach. Daunting for the political novice and attorney was creating an online presence. While the millennial is an avid user of social media and the Web, she had no idea how to build a website, calling it ""completely overwhelming."" Plus, she didn't have the time or campaign cash to maintain it and update it. ""I tried to set up a website and it's not something that's easy to do,"" she said, acknowledging that a candidate must have a social presence to engage voters. Businesses and brands are much more successful when there's a website. It's no different for political candidates. Obama perfected it, but many left out . While the 2012 presidential race was a $1 billion campaign and most Senate and House races are multi-million-dollar episodes featuring an interactive website, it's not in the cards for most running for some 550,000 state and local elected positions around the country. That's what the founders of Democracy.com set out to change, believing that an online presence will level the playing field for candidates, regardless of economic and political background and experience. Democracy.com is the ""social network for politics,"" founder Talmage Cooley said during a recent interview. He thought of the idea while attending the Harvard Kennedy School where he worked to find a solution to the abundance of money in politics and a flawed campaign finance system, which is steeped in political agendas with little chance of being reformed anytime soon. ""The only thing left was the marketplace of voter opinion,"" Cooley said. He noted that many candidates still didn't have an online presence in 2012, four years after Barack Obama revolutionized the use of the Web to mobilize supporters. Cooley formed a team with expertise in politics, tech and business, and received investor support to create a Facebook-type website for political candidates. ""For the first time, [candidates] can have an Obama quality"" Web presence,"" Cooley, a former Wall Street bond trader and filmmaker, said -- and at no cost. 'Democratizing democracy' The portal includes every political office -- from school board in Belfast, Maine, to President of the United States. All candidates have to do is ""claim"" their profile and then it's theirs to advertise campaign events, list their platform and raise money. It's how we can ""democratize democracy,"" Ray Rivera, the organization's co-founder and former Obama campaign organizer and state director. Cooley said his goal is to ""to see that elections are accessible to everyone."" He thinks he is doing just that by removing a significant technological and financial barrier. Even the most obscure candidates representing obscure political parties can have a profile on Demcoracy.com. Yasinow agrees. ""It levels the playing field and encourages qualified individuals to run for office,"" she said. Willingboro, New Jersey Town Councilman Nathaniel Anderson said Democracy.com enabled him to reach voters he normally wouldn't be able to, especially on the fundraising front. ""I would normally target relationships I already had,"" Anderson said of his 2013 re-election campaign. He said the public didn't donate to his campaign before he opened his profile, but then said, ""I was reaching a wider universe"" as voters took advantage of the donation mechanism on his Democracy.com profile. Cooley also said he couldn't believe that in 2012 candidate information for voters still couldn't be found in one place. So for the voter, it's one-stop-shopping.","Creating an online presence is a daunting task for many local political candidates .

"(CNN) -- Medecins Sans Frontieres slammed the United Nations Thursday for what it said was an ""unacceptable"" humanitarian response to the crisis in the Central African Republic. In an open letter, the group, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said it had ""deep concern"" over the United Nations' humanitarian agencies' ""appalling performance"" in the country over the past year. This failure, it said, has left tens of thousands of vulnerable people without the help they need. Violence has plagued the Central African Republic since a coalition of rebels deposed President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. The past week has seen a surge in fighting in the capital, Bangui, and in the town of Bossangoa, 185 miles north, where many of those displaced by months of conflict between Muslim and Christian militias have sought refuge in camps. French troops have now been deployed alongside African forces in a peacekeeping mission aimed at restoring security, protecting civilians and ensuring access to humanitarian aid. The MSF letter, addressed to Valerie Amos, the U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief, is scathing in its assessment of the U.N. response on the ground. As the situation deteriorated in the past three months, ""there has been no evidence of an adequate humanitarian reaction to the needs generated by repeated outbreaks of violence,"" the letter said. ""The only actions undertaken by UN aid officials have been the collection of data related to the fighting and a few assessments confirming the need for an immediate response. Repeated evaluations in the face of glaring needs, and numerous coordination meetings, have not led to any concrete action around the main hotspots."" The letter gives two examples in support of its criticism. ""MSF has repeatedly asked UN agencies to deliver food, tents and soap to the more than 15,000 people displaced in the vicinity of Bangui's airport, without any reaction,"" it said. In the second example, U.N. officials in Bossangoa were on security lockdown inside a compound run by African-led peacekeeping forces, the letter said. They ""did not even provide assistance to the displaced sheltering inside the same compound, forcing MSF to intervene once more."" The same officials remained on lockdown for days after the fighting, it added, ""abandoning the more than 30,000 displaced persons in the main Bossangoa camps."" MSF staff instead moved through the camps to give help, the letter said. That assistance included taking care of the wounded, digging latrines and providing access to drinking water. The U.N. said Thursday that U.N. agency personel have deployed to the field as security conditions permitted, adding that they are ""working closely"" with MSF and other key NGOs who have maintained a strong presence in CAR during the crisis. ""As this crisis worsens, it is important that all efforts and resources are focused on delivering aid to people in desperate need. As in all crises, there will be a time for evaluation of the humanitarian response, but now is the time for action,"" the U.N. said. Medecins Sans Frontieres, which has been present in the Central African Republic since 1997, says it is currently running seven regular projects and four emergency projects there. It has more than 100 foreign personnel and about 1,100 local staff in its teams, providing free medical care to nearly 400,000 people. The group believes the United Nations has overestimated the security risks in the Central African Republic, thereby restricting its agencies' ability to help ""people in an extreme state of need."" An MSF news release Thursday, published alongside the letter, said U.N. humanitarian organizations had now decided to ramp up their response in the Central African Republic. But while this is welcome, the group said, it is long overdue. ""This late decision must have a real impact and initiate radical and immediate change to the way UN humanitarian agencies respond to the crisis,"" said Bart Janssens, MSF director of operations. More than 415,000 people -- nearly 10% of the population -- have been internally displaced by the fighting, according to the United Nations, and 68,000 more have fled to neighboring countries.

"Miami (CNN) -- A Florida woman said she went into ""survival mode"" when a huge eagle ray weighing as much as 300 pounds landed on top of her on a boat in the Florida Keys, throwing her to the deck and pinning her underneath it. Jenny Hausch was riding on a chartered boat Friday with her husband and three children, taking pictures of a group of eagle rays as they launched themselves out of the water. ""As I was snapping a picture of the eagle ray in the water, it jumped out and I was able to get the picture of it flying in the air. And then the next jump, the eagle ray jumped straight into our boat, straight at my chest -- 300 pounds -- and knocked me backwards and was flapping around on top of me,"" Hausch told CNN Wednesday. ""I just basically pushed it off, pushed it off of me and tried to scoot backwards as fast as I could. I think all of us were in survival mode at that point and just doing whatever we could to get away from the ray,"" she recounted. One of her sons was hit with one of the ray's ""wings,"" her other son slid off the animal to the floor of the boat, and the ray flew over her daughter as it soared into the air, Hausch said. ""Everybody was able to keep their wits about them and was very brave and ... my husband picked up my daughter right away and made sure she was safe,"" Hausch said, adding that she knew there could have been a far worse outcome. In 2008, a woman died after a ray jumped out of the water and hit her as she boated in the Keys. ""I believe the eagle ray hit her a little bit higher in the neck, so we were very fortunate. If it had been a few inches higher, it could have been a much worse outcome. Luckily, the barbs did not hit anyone,"" Hausch said. Eagle rays can measure as much as 10 feet across and 17 feet long -- from their snout to the end of their barbed tails -- and weigh up to 500 pounds, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. The spines on the tails are venomous and can inflict serious wounds. After the Hausches scrambled to safety away from the ray, two Florida Fish and Wildlife officers patrolling nearby came to their aid after hearing the screams. ""We turned around and looked and saw the eagle ray thrashing around in the boat and at that point we realized we had a problem,"" said Officer Aja Vickers. Vickers and Officer Bret Swensson wrangled the sea creature back into the water, where it swam away, apparently unscathed. Kelly Klein, who was captain of the Two Chicks Charters boat the Hausches had rented, said . the animal measured 8-feet across, and probably weighed a good 300 pounds. ""It's just massive, it has a 10-foot tail,"" she added. Hausch's children were hysterical, but she and her husband decided to continue the charter in hopes that the incident wouldn't make them afraid of the water. Vickers said the incident was a ""total one-in-a-million chance."" ""These animals aren't attacking by any means,"" she said. ""One theory is these animals jump during mating season.""","Jenny Hausch was taking pictures of the rays as they flew out of the water .

"(CNN) -- It seems that the global super-rich like their private jets on the bland side. No matter if you're the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or electronics tycoon from Asia, it's likely a dark wood veneer and light-colored leather upholstery will envelop you in the lap of luxury at 38,000 feet. Even the bright red and yellow livery of kung-fu superstar Jackie Chan's new jet (that came with his role as ""ambassador"" for Brazilian plane-maker Embraer), gives way to a spotless interior of mid-tones and cream leather seats. If it doesn't seem to fit the persona of the martial arts actor, the companies that are fighting over the executive jet market are well aware that giving clients whatever they want, even if that is uniform luxury, is essential when it comes to securing a multi-million dollar sale of an aircraft. Battle for the skies at Singapore Airshow . ""It's the cabin that sells the aircraft,"" says David Velupillai, of Airbus Corporate Jets, from the back of a voluminous sofa on board a champagne-colored ACJ318. ""Usually clients just need it to be practical."" If you can afford a $65 million jet like the ACJ318 (based on the commercial A318), fluctuating fuel costs aren't as much of a concern as a spacious bedroom and enough space for a banquet in the sky. A round table that can convert into a square for mahjong games is an off-the-shelf option for Velupillai's prospective Chinese clients, who are also being targeted with laser-like precision by the other big corporate jet companies like Boeing Business Jets, Gulfstream, Embraer, Dassault and Bombardier. Just 15 years ago there was only one corporate jet in China, and private jet ownership was illegal in the country until 2003. Now there are over 200 private and executive jets in China and around 700 in Asia., according to Embraer. However that's a small fraction of the total number of private planes criss-crossing the globe -- Asia still only has about a 5% global share, compared to North America's 40%, the company says. China's challenge for air supremacy . But while bigger can mean better in the high status world of private jets, the market for smaller four or six-seater jets, accessible to millionaires, not billionaires, is increasing. Analysts predict that Asia is worth around $40 billion to the private jet market in the next 10 years, although there could be some bumps along the way for companies hoping to cash in on the privacy mores of high-net-worth flyers. ""It's not a recession-proof industry,"" says Jose Eduardo Costas, vice president of Embraer Executive jets for Asia Pacific. Like many other businesses, Europe's precarious economic position is the main worry for private jet manufacturers. ""The drivers of this market remain the same; it's how the economies are performing, how the companies are doing, how the stock markets are,"" says Costas. ""We still have a lot of the bottlenecks (in Asia) that the West has overcome over the last 30 to 40 years -- access to airspace and dedicated infrastructure like private jet terminals and common regulations. They will be smoothed out in time."" Test your aviation knowledge . Courting clients and getting them to part with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars is one thing, but dealing with their demands once the plane is in the air is another. ""Every owner is different,"" says Jenny Lau, CEO of SinoJet that manages six private planes in China, including the Jackie Chan jet. The company is one of many springing up to serve China's private jet owners with air and ground crew. ""Some owners don't want to be bothered at all during a flight, but one might want his ashtray to be cleaned after two cigarettes. One gentleman, for example, if he was to land in Kazakhstan to refuel would expect a blanket to be handed to him, immigration forms to be filled out, that kind of thing."" Lau, a former finance executive from Hong Kong, expects Sinojet to double its client list in the coming year. Her company and others like it are learning to deal with the spontaneous whims of the owners. That could be having a pilot and stewardess ready to go in a couple of hours for a flight to a different city just for dinner or jetting off for a Big Game hunt in Africa. ""Some are very particular, often about little things like table-wear and having their own and favorite chopsticks."" Demanding, yes, ""but they're all very nice!"" she adds.","Most buyers of private jets seek uniform luxury, companies say .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- James Bond would be lost without them -- those madcap gadgets merging two technologies that help him beat the bad guys and save the planet. The underwater watch with a built-in Geiger counter, for example; or the car that doubles as a submarine; or the exploding bagpipes and missile-launching wheelchair. An artist's impression of what a Flying Electric Generator might look like . Now a U.S. company has taken a leaf out of 007's book and developed a similarly unlikely ""combination"" technology. The ""villain"" in this case is not a psychotic, cat-stroking megalomaniac, but something both more prosaic and, potentially, more threatening -- global warming: in particular, how to meet the world's energy needs without swamping the planet with clouds of atmosphere-clogging pollutants. And the madcap gadget that might just provide a solution? A helicopter that doubles as a wind turbine. Or, to give it its technical name, a FEG (Flying Electric Generator). The brainchild of Australian engineering specialist Professor Bryan Roberts, the FEG is being developed by San Diego-based company SkyWindPower. Code-cracker turned turbine enthusiast . The latter is headed by David Shepard, who started his career cracking Japanese military ciphers during World War Two, and went on to create the Farrington B numeric font that appears on credit cards around the world. Shepard has long been convinced of the need for a new global energy source to reduce reliance on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. For the last two decades his attention has focused on the electricity-generating potential of high-altitude winds, and when he learnt of Professor Roberts' prototype ""gyromill"" -- a flying wind turbine that the Australian had been developing since 1979 -- he decided it offered the best model for realizing that potential. The two men started working together in 2002, and the FEG is the result. High-altitude winds . The guiding principle of the FEG is that wind speed and constancy are far greater at high altitude than they are on the ground, especially in the two major jet streams - the Sub-Tropical Jet and the Polar Front Jet - that exist in each hemisphere (at around 30 degrees and 60 degrees latitude respectively). A turbine at great height, so the theory goes, can generate far more power than a similar turbine at or near ground level. It has been estimated that capturing just one percent of the available energy of these high altitude winds would meet the electricity needs of the entire planet. ""The winds a few miles above the mid latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are far stronger and more persistent than the winds just above us,"" Shepard told CNN. ""This results in potentially being able to generate electricity for over eighty percent of the time, as opposed to thirty percent of the time at ground-based wind turbine sites. ""The largest ground-based wind turbines currently produce about five megawatts each. We expect typical FEGs to produce about 20 megawatts each."" Helicopter technology . But how do we get a working turbine up to the necessary height -- at least 15,000 ft (4600 meters) above the earth's surface? That's where helicopter technology comes in. Taking the form of a giant H-shaped frame, the prototype FEG has four huge blades at the four points of the H, each blade 10.7 meters (35 feet) in diameter. These act like the rotors of a helicopter, lifting the FEG to the required height. Once in place, the blades not only keep the FEG air-born, providing lift like the surface area of a kite, but also act as turbines, turning dynamos within the platform that generate electricity, which is transmitted back to earth through a vast aluminum tethering cable. An in-built GPS (Global Positioning System) uses satellite technology to ensure that the FEG always remains in the same place, both vertically and horizontally. According to Shepard, development is already at an advanced stage. ""Professor Roberts demonstrated a FEG in Australia at an altitude of sixty feet over a decade ago,"" he told CNN. U.S. demonstration in three years . ""We expect to make a demonstration in the U.S. less than three years from now at high altitude in normal high altitude winds. In four years I would expect this sort of technology to be in active use."" As with ground-based wind farms, Shepard envisages whole ""sky-farms"" of FEGs hovering above the earth in restricted airspace. Forty-three such FEG ""arrays"" -- each comprising 600 FEGs -- would, he estimates, generate sufficient electricity to power the whole of the U.S. ""Our calculations show that by reserving less than one four-hundredth of U.S. air space, located at relatively remote locations not on airway routes, all of America's electrical energy needs could be met,"" he says. ""That is considerably less airspace than is already restricted for other purposes, primarily military."" Not only would the FEGs provide clean energy -- the feedback from environmental groups, according to Shepard, has been overwhelmingly positive -- but at less cost than conventional electricity generation. While each FEG would cost an estimated $2,260,000 to build, maintain and support, arrays of FEGS would, in the long term, prove extremely cost effective, generating electricity at about 2 cents per kilowatt hour, as opposed to the 3-5 cents of conventional generating methods. There are risks, of course. Even in restricted airspace there is the possibility of collision with aircraft that unwittingly -- or illegally -- stray into that airspace. Likewise, despite numerous design features aimed at ensuring the stability of the air-born FEG, the possibility of the structure malfunctioning and plummeting to earth cannot be excluded. Crashes ""inevitable"" ""Inevitably crashes will occur,"" the SkyWindPower Web site acknowledges, ""Just as airplane crashes occur. ""Statistically, however, FEGs should be just as reliable as commercial airliners, whose safety records are incredibly good. ""And FEGs don't take off or land at airports teeming with people in and around them."" Shepard and Roberts are not the only people to have considered harnessing the power of high-altitude winds. Magenn Power, a Canadian company, have been developing a helium-filled, medium altitude wind generator, while in the Netherlands Laddermill has been exploring similar ground using kite technology. SkyWindPower's FEG, however, is at the forefront of the field, with the U.S. government showing considerable interest in the prototype helicopter-cum-wind-turbine. Whether it will provide a definitive solution to the world's ever-increasing energy needs remains to be seen. With the effects of global warming and climate change becoming increasingly acute, however, a technology that might once have been dismissed as no more than a James Bond fantasy now looks as if it could have a serious role to play. They might not be quite as sexy as your average Bond adventure, but flying wind turbines could end up generating a lot more heat than 007 and Pussy Galore ever did. .......................................

"(CNN) -- Celebrities and their bodies. We're obsessed. They're obsessed. And it spills over to how many people feel about themselves. But how much concern over weight gain is about vanity and how much is about critical health issues? Kathy Ireland says she's more concerned about what weight gain does to her health than her appearance. On Monday's ""Larry King Live,"" Kathy Ireland and Bob Greene joined Larry to talk about the subject, prompted by Kirstie Alley's well-publicized battle with weight. Ireland is a former supermodel and actress and has had her own weight issues. Greene is Oprah Winfrey's personal trainer. The interview picks up here after King plays a clip from Alley's appearance on the show last week. In the clip, Alley says her weight gain was ""humiliating. I think the biggest, most painful thing for me is I have all these people I inspired and then I let them down.""  Watch Alley discuss weight gain » . Larry King: Are we overly involved with this topic, Kathy? Kathy Ireland: Well, I think we are for the wrong reasons. And I think there is such an obsession with appearance. With my weight gain, people wanted to know, well, when is she going to squeeze back into a bikini? No. That is not what it's about. But what people weren't asking me, what's the triglyceride level? What is the C reactive protein? Larry, with your foundation and what you are doing to make heart health at the forefront of everyone's mind, and Bob with your information about healthy living, it is so important. Heart disease is the number one killer of women in America. King: We're not just talking aesthetics? Bob Greene: No, we're not. We run into problems any time we think weight is the problem. Weight is a symptom of something that needs to change in your life. King: Kathy, you [were an] internationally famous swimsuit model, and then you gained weight, right? Ireland: The weight gain was gradual, about a pound a year for the past 25 years. I intentionally built a business that has absolutely nothing to do with my appearance. So I would think what does it matter? My food choices. Well, what matters is what am I doing to my health? And I encourage people -- you know, please don't put it off. Every mom I know has a to-do list. Put yourself on that to-do list. Call your doctor tomorrow. Get an appointment. Find out what is the health of your heart. King: Is fluctuating weight like Kirstie Alley bad, Bob? Greene: Well, there's two sides to that story. First off, if you remain heavy, that's when the most damage is done to your heart and the excessive health ramifications from keeping overweight. So as long as you're watching, even if it's yo-yo dieting, that's healthier than the person that remains heavy. However, the best thing is to live the lifestyle of moving more and eating less and pursuing what it is that got you there in the first place. King: By the way, Bob's posted an exclusive commentary for our blog. Read Bob Greene's blog on CNN. Let's take another look at a clip of Kirstie Alley talking with Oprah about her weight struggles. [video clip begins] Alley: And then when I gained weight the last time and lost it, I honest to God thought, this is it. This will be the last time I ever do this again. Winfrey: Yes. And now you know differently. But you knew because you had all that exercise equipment in your house, remember? We went to your house, and there was all the exercise equipment in the living room. Alley: And I moved it out and made it a dining room. [video clip ends] . King: That's Kirstie sort of making fun of this, don't you think? Ireland: I appreciate her honesty and her openness. And Oprah, she has let us know that there's no shame in a weight gain. With the picture that our son took of me, I was tempted to push the delete button. But, you know, beautiful people come in all shapes and sizes, ages and colors. But we've got to get the message out about health. What kind of message is that sending to our children? King: Kathy, are we getting better? Ireland: I hope we're getting better. I pray we're getting better. We've got to teach our children. We've got to get the message out there for women, don't beat yourself up. But please be healthy. Don't put off your health. It's too important. King: Do you notice more interest? Greene: I see more interest in the foods we eat, but I see less interest in moving more, which is at least one-third of the problem, and even less interest in resolving the things in our life that drive us to the refrigerator. King: This is not purely American, is it? Or is it? Greene: No, it's starting to shift over into Australia, New Zealand, overseas. So it's not uniquely American.","Ex-model Kathy Ireland: Quit worrying about image, start taking care of your heart .

"San Diego (CNN) -- The most important tool that law enforcement officers have at their disposal is common sense. This is especially true with that segment of the force that spends the most time interacting with the public: traffic cops and highway patrol officers who enforce the vehicle code. I'm glad the San Diego police officer who pulled me over a couple of years ago had common sense. He had spotted me holding onto my smartphone and suspected that I was violating California's ""hands free"" law. The law, which took effect in 2008, prohibits drivers from talking on a cell phone while driving. By the time the officer approached the driver's side window, he had his ticket book out. After we exchanged pleasantries, he told me that he had pulled me over for talking on the phone while driving. That's true, I said. I was talking on the phone. Then, I turned my head, so he could see the Bluetooth headset lodged in my right ear. I was using a hands-free device, just as the law requires. But, I explained, I had to lay my hands on the phone, if only for a second, to push the button that makes a call. ""That makes sense,"" the officer said with a smile as he closed his ticket book. ""Have a nice day."" There is no argument that distracted driving can be just as dangerous as drunken driving, and so states have the right to pass laws that ban the practice of talking on the phone while driving. Twelve states and the District of Columbia have such laws on the books. Forty-two states and the District of Columbia also ban texting while driving. However, these laws raise questions. For instance, if the idea is to stop drivers from being distracted, then why stop at banning handheld cell phones? We can hold the steering wheel with one hand while using the other to drink a cup of coffee or eat a hamburger, but we can't use it to hold a phone? We can fiddle with the radio or -- in a minivan, the DVD player -- but we can't access Pandora or satellite radio on our phone? Besides, as illustrated by a recent appeals court decision in Central California that could reverberate around the country, passing a law is the easy part. It is implementing it on the street that can get tricky for police -- especially in the age of the smartphone that doesn't just let you make a call but also provides a variety of functions that, far from being harmful to motorists, might prove helpful. For instance, you can access a map with your phone. That's what Steven Spriggs of Fresno, California, was trying to do a few years ago when an officer with the California Highway Patrol pulled him over. Spriggs says that he was stuck in heavy traffic because of road construction, and that he was using the map function on his phone to look for an alternate route. Spriggs tried to explain to the officer that he wasn't talking on the phone, and so -- given his understanding of the state's hands-free law -- he had not committed any infraction. The officer didn't buy it and proceeded to write him a $165 ticket. Spriggs thought that was unfair, and so he fought the ticket in court -- all the way, in fact, to the 5th District Court of Appeals, which recently ruled in his favor. The appeals court threw out the ticket, declaring that the California State Legislature had only intended to prevent talking on the phone while driving. Nothing more. ""Spriggs contends he did not violate the statute because he was not talking on the telephone. We agree,"" the court wrote. ""We conclude the statute means what it says -- it prohibits a driver only from holding a wireless telephone while conversing on it."" This may be that we have not heard the last of this case. The state could appeal, and the California Supreme Court could agree to hear the case. The legislature could decide to amend the law to broaden it out and perhaps close some of the loopholes. For now though, this is a major victory -- not just for one California motorist but for common sense. The officer who stopped Spriggs that day on the roadway was short on it. He could have saved us all time and trouble by not forcing the issue and making room for the possibility that there was nuance in how the law should be applied. Yet, the good news is that the appeals court had enough to keep law enforcement from overreaching. The framers of the Constitution could never have imagined automobiles or cell phones. Yet, because of how they felt about the courts reining in the power of the state, you can bet that they would be pleased at how this story turned out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","California court sided with a driver who looked at a map on phone while in his car .

"(CNN) -- Poland has been firmly in Ukraine's corner in recent years, which is quite a shift given that the two nations were historically rivals. It seems odd to cheer for a nation whose ancestors tried to kill my mother and destroyed my father's house, but I do. That's because like Poles, Ukrainians suffered greatly under Moscow's oppression, so nothing would please me more than to see Ukraine shake the Kremlin's grip to enjoy freedom and prosperity. Last summer, I visited Rivne and Lviv, Ukraine, hometowns of my mother and father. They were Polish towns, Rowne and Lwow, in 1939 before Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland and changed the map. The word Ukraine means ""borderland,"" as this area changed hands many times among Austria, Poland and Russia before an independent Ukraine was established in 1991. In the battles over these fertile lands, Ukrainians, Jews, Poles and others faced the horrors of the Stalin-engineered Holodomor famine, the Holocaust, the Volhynia massacre and other bloodbaths. Both sides of my family endured these atrocities and their estates were destroyed. My mother was 11 in 1939 when she watched from a hilltop cemetery in Rowne as German fighter planes bombed her house to the ground. She moved in with relatives in a village called Mizocz, where she saw German soldiers march the Jews out of town. They were taken to a ravine and shot. When Germany started losing the war, Christian Orthodox Ukrainian nationalists murdered Polish Catholics and took their property. My mother escaped the massacre by hiding in an outhouse pit covered in feces and leaves. Trying to flee west, the Nazis forced her into slave labor clearing dead bodies and collecting scrap metal after Allied bombing raids. In July, carrying addresses and a map from 1939, my friend Marek and I traveled to Rivne to find our roots. The countryside was abundant with wheat fields and bright sunflowers. The town was full of weeping willows and apricot trees, just as my mother had described. My family's restaurant was gone, but I recognized the church from old photos. The Communists removed the steeple and turned it into a cultural center. A new house is being constructed where my grandparents' house used to be. Marek had more luck finding his family's house and with a huge smile, he picked apricots from a tree out front. While enjoying the fresh fruit, we walked up the hill to find the spot where my mother watched the bombing of her house and to see whether any tombstones had our families' names on them. We climbed the old steps and found remains of a wrought iron cemetery fence, but the graveyard was gone. The 1939 map clearly marked sections of Catholic, Jewish and Christian Orthodox graves. The tombstones were missing, replaced by a playground. A chill came over me watching children kicking around a soccer ball, unaware of the bones buried beneath the rickety gymnastics bars and playground. Opinion: Putin's Ukrainian endgame . We later found an article on a Ukrainian website, revealing that in the 1970s the Soviets used the tombstones in the construction of a school and a Communist committee building. The article decried the ""sinful deeds of our predecessors"" and the ""heartless barbaric"" act of demolishing the cemeteries. The next day, we left for Lviv, 130 miles away, where my ancestral home was on Green Street on a hill overlooking the historic city, which was then Polish and called Lwow. My father was 17, too young to join the army when Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland, but he and his Boy Scout troop blew up a bridge as a Russian army transport was crossing. This act of sabotage against the invading army caused a backlash against his family. He returned home late one night to find the lights on. He peered through the window at Russian soldiers waiting for him in the kitchen. My grandfather was in custody, and the soldiers were drinking his vodka. He never saw his parents, or Lwow, again. My father fled to Romania where the Polish underground sent him to France to enlist in the French army to fight Nazi Germany. When France fell, he was evacuated to England, and later took part in the Normandy invasion as a motorcycle scout for a tank unit. The house on Green Street was demolished by the Soviets out of spite. The Ukrainians built a soccer stadium in its place, on a hill overlooking the town. I found the stadium and noticed a vegetable garden past some bushes and trees. Beyond the trees was an old red brick villa, just as my father had described. I went closer to take photos. It had seen better days, but it was clearly an upscale residence when first built. An old man emerged from a shed and said, ""What are you looking for?"" He was carrying a rake made from a tree branch and twigs fastened with twine. I explained that his brick house looked similar to my father's, which was demolished by the Soviets. He said, ""Yes, there was another house just like this one. But when I moved here 60 years ago, it had already been knocked down. All that was left was a pile of bricks. The Communists did not like the people who lived there."" Opinion: A divided Ukraine? Think again . The old man said the bricks were used to make a kiln to build the stadium. Everyone in town, including him, was forced to work on the project. The mystery of my father's house had been solved. Pulling Ukrainian money from my pocket, I offered it to the old man and said he should buy himself a drink on me. Insulted, he pushed my hand away and said, ""No. I did not tell you this because I want something from you. I told you this because you should know what happened to your father's house."" We nodded politely, and he went back to raking grass to feed to his goats. I took pictures of the stadium and noticed that off to one side, was an old kiln made out of aged red bricks, bricks from my father's house, just as the old man had said. Part of the kiln was crumbling, so I took one of the bricks with me. It's sitting on my desk as I write this. Today, Ukraine is still a borderland between a free Western Europe and an authoritarian Russia. My parent's hometowns are part of Ukraine now, and the people who live there deserve the peace, prosperity and freedom that Poland and other countries achieved after breaking from the Kremlin's orbit. Yes, I'm cheering for Ukraine. But looking at this brick from my father's house that was used to build the stadium, somehow it's hard to root for Lviv's soccer club, even if it is technically my home team. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Storozynski.","Alex Storozynski roots for Ukraine despite the suffering of his family there .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- By its very nature, jatropha is divisive. The poisonous, deep-rooted shrub is traditionally used as hedging to protect food crops from hungry animals. Workers tend Jatropha plants at a D1 Oils farm in Hluthi district, Swaziland, July 19, 2007. Now it has a new purpose, and this time it's dividing opinion. Some say it can help solve the world's fuel crisis, others say there are too many uncertainties to call it a sure bet, while environmentalists have another set of reasons again for objecting to its large-scale production. Jatropha is native to Central America but in recent years the shrub has been propagated around the world by developers convinced of its potential as a source of oil. Seeds are being sown in India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, Malaysia, Brazil and large swathes of Africa. Research firm New Energy Finance estimates that more than 720 thousand hectares of jatropha have been planted. By 2014, it estimates that number to have risen three-fold to over 21 million hectares. There's little argument that the seeds can be crushed to extract oil that, once refined, makes a high-quality biodiesel. The question is whether enough oil can be derived from large-scale plantations to make the product economically viable. In a research note released in early March, New Energy Finance said: ""While the positive claims on jatropha are plentiful, promises of high yields in sub-optimal conditions are as yet unproven."" ""Concrete figures on productivity and seed oil yields are at best limited and those that are available often contradict stated projections. This is especially the case in marginal conditions, where jatropha is supposed to prove its worth."" The believers . Stanley Wootliff, the chairman of British-based jatropha producer Viridas, has little time for doubters. ""There are a lot of people out there who make pronouncements on all sorts of subjects based on gut feeling without knowing anything in depth about what they're talking about,"" he says. ""Anyone who was not positive about jatropha I would put under that category because they haven't done their research."" Viridas is doing its research. It has planted a small trial plantation in Brazil where it's testing how much difference varying amounts of water and fertilizer make to the shrub's yield. ""We already know it's going to work. If you take wild jatropha seeds growing in the middle of anywhere, uncultivated, and crush them, you'd get a yield of 1.8 tonnes per hectare and that is economically viable,"" Wootliff says. ""What we're saying is that's the average yield, therefore one would expect the yields to improve."" Once the results are known at the end of the year, the group plans to go back to the market to raise more money for large-scale production. ""Brazil has 90 million hectares of unused land at this moment in time,"" Wootliff says. ""Nothing's growing on it. Historically it was forest -- they chopped it down. We're coming back and reforesting it."" Seeds of hope . It's easy to see how the buzz has developed around jatropha as the next big thing in biofuel. Jatropha's deep root system allows it to grow on marginal land. And, unlike traditional biofuel crops of soy, corn, canola and palm oil, it's poisonous, rendering the argument of food versus fuel irrelevant. Fully grown crops can be five meters tall and because only the seeds are harvested jatropha qualifies for inclusion in reforestation projects. On paper it sounds ideal, but environmentalists have reservations about its large-scale production. ""Jatropha is at the moment being promoted as a wonder crop but that's actually not true,"" says Kenneth Richter, biofuels campaigner for Friends of the Earth. ""Jatropha can grow on relatively poor soils, but obviously it grows far better on good soils. What we see in reality, if you go to India and places in Africa, is that western companies are going in and buying up large amounts of land from the farmers."" He says the poisonous plant is being introduced to areas where it's not native, threatening and, in some cases, killing local wildlife. And furthermore, he says, once it's been planted, it's there to stay. ""It's particularly difficult to get rid of once you've grown the plants; it's basically a weed in some countries."" Keeping the faith . British-based jatropha producer D1 Oils is a pioneer of the industry. The business was founded by entrepreneur Karl Watkin and listed on London's Alternative Investment Market in 2004. On March 7, the company warned that it was consulting its workforce about job losses, saying imports of heavily subsidized biodiesel from the U.S. had eroded margins to the point where it had no choice but to consider reducing costs. The company's share price plummeted, prompting Karl Watkin's resignation. He issued a scathing statement saying he'd become ""increasingly frustrated"" over ""the inability of the investment community, governments and NGOs to differentiate D1's strategy from that of the suppliers of palm, soya and rapeseed whose biodiesel products have been well documented as being environmentally unsustainable."" Graham Prince, communications director of D1 Oils, says in some cases jatropha has been the victim of unsubstantiated hype. ""The key thing is that people need to be realistic about jatropha and its yields."" ""We're at the first stage of commercialization of these crops,"" he says, adding ""even at the first stage we're seeing very promising yields."" While keen to put expectations in perspective, D1 Oils, in partnership with oil company BP, has announced plans to plant 50,000 hectares of so-called ""elite seed"" this year, capable of producing 2.7 tonnes of oil per hectare. Harry Boyle, analyst at New Energy Finance says his team won't be convinced of the potential of jatropha until it sees firm figures on the table. 'It's like what they say about Brazil -- it's the country for the future and it always will be. People have been getting excited about jatropha for two or three years."" ""Until you see a one million hectare plantation producing regular amounts of jatropha crude year after year then it's hard to see how quickly the jatropha industry will progress."" That could be some time away. Many of the seeds that were planted in the rush to gain first mover advantage in what producers say could be a very lucrative field are still years away from maturity. What is agreed right now is that there's very little scientific information about large-scale production of jatropha oil. While analysts and cautious investors are content to wait for the plant to prove its worth, for producers and speculators there's no time to waste.

"(CNN) -- Iranian authorities have buried the body of a political prisoner, who was executed last week, without the presence of his family or friends, his son told CNN. Ali Saremi's body was buried over the weekend at the Amir-Abad village in Boroujerd, nearly 400 kilometers southwest of Tehran. ""The authorities never informed my family about my father's execution and now the government has barred us from holding any kind of funeral service,"" his son, Akbar Saremi, said. Ali Saremi was hanged for ""fighting against the sacred Islamic Republic of Iran system and launching antagonist propagations,"" Iranian state-run media reported at the time of his execution Tuesday. Iranian authorities allege that Saremi was a member of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, which has opposed the Iranian government for decades. Tehran considers the group to be a terrorist outfit, as does the United States. The European Union does not. Members of the Friends of a Free Iran group condemned Saremi's execution Tuesday, calling it ""another crime for which the mullahs will be held to account when freedom is finally restored to that beleaguered nation."" The group also demanded that Iranian leaders ""be tried in the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity."" Ali Saremi had been arrested five times since 1982. His latest arrest came in 2007 after visiting his son at Camp Ashraf, a refugee community in Iraq that is home to an estimated 3,500 exiled members of the Mujahedeen, Akbar Salemi told CNN. Saremi was arrested for his alleged presence at anti-revolutionary gatherings organized by the People's Mujahedeen and for sending information for the group, according to Iranian state media reports. Akbar Salemi denied those allegations, saying his father's ""only interest in Mojahedin-e Khalgh (MEK) and Camp Ashraf was to visit me, and that's the last time I saw my father."" ""This is a very difficult time for my family,"" Akbar Saremi said, adding that other family members are being targeted now. ""My cousin is still being detained after he displayed a picture of my father on the door of the family home as a sign of mourning,"" Saremi said. Other family members were detained last week as they gathered outside the prison where Ali Saremi was hanged. They have since been released.","Ali Saremi was buried without the presence of his family, his son says .

"Zintan, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan rebels said Monday they remain in control of a key western town they seized from Moammar Gadhafi forces Saturday, although clashes continued just east of it. The Libyan government said earlier its forces had retaken Bir al-Ghanam but Jumma Ibrahim, a rebel spokesman in the western mountain region, said the claims were false. Rebel commander Nasser abu al Qassem told CNN Monday that the rebels are holding firm on the town's eastern outskirts, squaring off against loyalists just a few miles away at a key road junction the rebels hope to take in the days ahead. He reported regular exchanges of fire between the two sides. The rebels entered Bir al-Ghanam in June but only held it for a matter of hours. Capturing the town puts the rebels closer to Tripoli than they've been before. The town is about 85 kilometers (53 miles) southwest of the Libyan capital. Meanwhile, bombs rained down on Tripoli overnight, the sky lit up by explosives. Multiple airstrikes and secondary explosions could be heard continuously for the better part of an hour. Entire neighborhoods of the city were already without electricity -- due to shortages of fuel -- prior to  the pre-dawn strikes. Parts  of Tripoli have been suffering for days from such blackouts. Gadhafi's forces fired several rockets Sunday in Bir al-Ghanam, causing minor damage inside the town but no rebel injuries, al Qassem said. He reported no further rocket attacks so far Monday. Al Qassem said NATO forces had informed the rebels that the Gadhafi forces included up to 40 trucks outfitted with heavy weapons, and rebel forces had reinforced their positions Sunday and overnight into Monday. He was confident the rebel lines would hold and said there had been no concerted effort so far by the government troops to try to re-take Bir al-Ghanam. The battle to take Bir al-Ghanam lasted for nearly five hours Saturday and was fought on three fronts. CNN witnessed heavy rocket, mortar and anti aircraft gun fire from the rebel side at one front near a Gadhafi military encampment three kilometres west of the town. Gadhafi forces returned fire with rockets and mortars. Commanders said taking the junction where Gadhafi forces remain east of the town would provide a direct route to the coastal city of Azzawayia. They told CNN they wouldn't reveal a timetable to move further forward, but said there would be ""surprises from the fighters of Zintan very soon. For months, rebel fighters -- who control the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer to the capital. They are seeking the ouster of Gadhafi, who has ruled Libya for 42 years. CNN's Ivan Watson contributed to this report from Tripoli.","NEW: NATO jets strike Tripoli hard .

"(CNN) -- Newcastle manager Alan Pardew's head-butt on an opposition player has landed him with an improper conduct charge by the English Football Association (FA) and the prospect of a lengthy ban. As widely expected, the FA acted swiftly Monday to charge the 52-year-old Pardew, who has until March 6 to respond. ""Due to the serious violent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behavior this case has been designated as non-standard,"" a statement on the official FA website said. Newcastle's English Premier League match Saturday at Hull City's KC stadium was in the 72nd minute when Pardew was involved with an altercation with the home side's David Meyler, who was retrieving a ball for a throw in. Pardew, who had been standing in his side's technical area, made a forward movement with his head, which was spotted by referee Kevin Friend, who sent him to the stands. Newcastle won the match 4-1, but within hours of the match finishing the club took disciplinary action against Pardew, fining him Â£100,000 ($168,000) and warning him about his future behavior. Pardew, who has been manager of the north-east club since December 2010, ""unreservedly apologized"" for his actions in a statement on the club's website. But he has previous history of controversial touchline incidents, as far back as 2006 tangling with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger when he was in charge at West Ham. In March 2012 came another set to with then Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill, while later that year his touchline shove of a linesman in the season-opener against Tottenham Hotspur earned his a two-match touchline ban from the FA and a hefty fine.

"(CNN) -- The Australian navy has destroyed nearly 353 kilograms (780 pounds) of heroin after intercepting the drugs on a smuggling vessel off the coast of Tanzania, the Australian Department of Defense said Friday. Authorities estimate the street value at 706 million Australian dollars ($630 million U.S.). A team from the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne boarded the smuggler ship Wednesday during a sweep, according to a prepared statement. It tested the substance on board, determined it to be heroin, then confiscated it. Members then extracted samples and destroyed the rest.","The Australian navy has destroyed nearly 353 kilograms (780 pounds) of heroin .

"(CNN) -- The United States Senate's proud slogan -- ""world's greatest deliberative body"" -- seems out of place in the current atmosphere where distrust and bitterness dominate and persuasion and freewheeling debate seem like relics of a bygone era. But on Wednesday, senators will take small steps aimed at restoring their ""deliberative"" functions when they take up a minor, non-confrontational, bipartisan bill providing block grants for child care programs. What separates this bill from any other in recent memory is that Democratic leaders, who control the floor, won't dictate what amendments get debated and put up for a vote. They've refused to do that in the past, fearing Republicans would load bills with unrelated ""gotcha"" amendments designed to punish Democrats politically. It's the refusal to allow amendments that has infuriated Republicans and led to so many of the GOP filibusters that have clogged the Senate floor in recent years. And those filibusters have, in turn, angered Democrats, and contributed to their controversial decision last year to change Senate rules over the objections of Republicans to limit filibusters. The idea of returning to an open amendment process is the brainchild of a bipartisan duo -- Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat of New York, and Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Republican of Tennessee -- who have privately worked together for weeks trying to figure out how to lower the political temperature and restore some of the important traditions of the Senate. After all, the Founding Fathers wanted the Senate to be a place where the hot debate of the House cooled like a saucer cools tea. Schumer, who never shied from the TV lights as he climbed the ranks of leadership, has been noticeably lower key in the last couple of years and has made strides to work across the aisle on a number of tough issues. Alexander, who has had a varied career in and out of government, recently left the third-ranking post in GOP Senate leadership saying he wanted to do more to bridge differences between the parties. So on Wednesday, their experiment will be tested -- sort of like falling blindly back into each other's arms. The child care bill will be put on the floor without any of the procedural hurdles that are commonplace now. It will then be up to the two bill managers, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, and Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, to work out which amendments will get votes. If someone tries to force a vote to defund Obamacare or put new sanctions on Iran, (two issues Democratic leaders refuse to consider right now) the effort likely will collapse. If amendments are non-controversial and relevant to the child care bill, it should pass. During this election year, when tensions between the parties are likely to worsen, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said he wants to put bills on the floor that have been voted out of committee with the support of the Democratic chairman and the ranking Republican. Bipartisan bills dealing with sentencing reform, energy efficiency, and manufacturing innovation fit that description and could be considered next, a Democratic aide said. The success of Wednesday's controlled demonstration may determine if the effort continues. Feinstein says CIA spied on Senate computers . Republicans win first election showdown of the year .","Effort led by two senators aims to restore some semblance of deliberation .

"(CNN) -- Many angry Americans are urging a punishment on Florida in the killing of Trayvon Martin: a boycott. Musician Stevie Wonder won't perform there. Martin Luther King III is considering deploying the tactic -- often used by his famous father in the civil rights era -- against Florida products like orange juice. Social media activists advance boycott plans even on the state's official tourism page on Facebook. Their actions seek the repeal of Florida's ""stand your ground"" self-defense law, which was at the center of a national debate in the wake of Martin's shooting death. George Zimmerman's lawyers didn't invoke Florida's ""stand your ground"" law in court, but it was included in the instructions to the jury that acquitted him. But will a boycott work? And when are they effective? 'Stand your ground' laws up to states, not Obama or Congress . The win column is spotty for boycotts against controversial state laws, experts say. The matter becomes further complicated by the fact that more than 20 states -- not just Florida -- have such a law. ""For boycott organizers, it's more difficult with a state,"" said Daniel Diermeier, a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ""Let's say your goal is to change a particular law,"" he continued. ""If you think about a political process, you could have multiple chambers and a governor. The political process is much slower and messier than a corporate decision process."" One example of success -- at least economically, one group says -- is the recent boycott of Arizona for its immigration laws. Akin to the Florida ""stand your ground"" law, the Arizona immigration law ""triggered a fierce, national public-opinion backlash against the state and led many national organizations and opinion leaders to call for economic boycotts,"" said a 2010 report by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Arizona lost at least $141 million after groups canceled their conventions there, according to estimates in the 2010 study. ""This report provides a clear window into the potentially catastrophic impacts of pursuing harsh, state-based immigration policies,"" the center said. But other analysts point out how Arizona didn't change its immigration laws, despite the boycott. It took the U.S. Supreme Court to do that, in a decision last year striking down key parts of the state law that sought to deter illegal immigration. ""It didn't impact the state in such a manner that people considered changing the rules and regulations, so all of this was done with very little positive results,"" said Abraham Pizam, a tourism professor and dean of the hospitality management college at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, which is also home to Disney World. Protesters stand up to 'stand your ground,' but laws likely here to stay . But the center said the boycott did send a warning: ""Other states considering immigration legislation should pause before rushing to adopt measures like (the Arizona law) S.B. 1070 and understand the potentially disastrous economic and fiscal consequences of such a decision."" In general, boycotts have three functions: to cause economic damage, to keep a spotlight on public issues and to achieve a stated objective, Diermeier says. While boycotts can be effective in the first two aims, the third goal can be murky. ""Do they accomplish the objective? There, the record is spotty,"" Diermeier said. ""They are driven by outrage and anger, but they (sometimes) don't have a clearly specified objective."" The Occupy movement in 2011 had such results: ""They never accomplished a specific objective. It was more of a channel for outrage,"" he said. Among the better-known cases of boycotts producing major political change is in the apartheid era of South Africa, when many nations imposed an economic and cultural boycott so intense that the country became an international pariah. The boycott lasted several years. Finally, under the international pressure, South Africa ended apartheid, the system of legalized racial segregation. That was more than 20 years ago. ""Many said that (boycott) had an effect, but it lasted a long time, and it was supported by a large number of countries, and it was supported by the vast population,"" Pizam said. ""That's a different situation than we have now"" with ""stand your ground"" laws, Pizam added. ""There are people in Florida -- I know some of my colleagues -- who feel the 'stand your ground' law is the right thing to do in Florida, so you don't have 100% support"" for a boycott, he said. In addition to needing widespread support, a boycott would have to offer consumers easy alternatives. For example, can Americans easily cancel their family vacation to Orlando's Disney World? Can they easily find a substitute for their favorite Florida orange juice brand, especially when growers say they had nothing to do with the jury's acquittal of Zimmerman? ""For a boycott to be successful, we have to ask people to do things against their economic interests,"" said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor at the Wharton School of Business. ""People are going to visit Disney or not. They are going to visit Grandma or not."" Boycotts require a commitment, such as when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led a successful boycott against buses and other public transportation in Montgomery, Alabama, in the 1950s as part of the civil rights movement, experts said. A clear and simple goal must be present, with ""a protracted feeling of outrage,"" Pizam said. The sliding scales of self-defense . Remember how Americans boycotted French wine after France declined to join a U.S.-led coalition to invade Iraq in 2003? ""The feelings that we have today are not the feelings that we're going to have in six months,"" Pizam said. ""Just as we were upset at France and might have chosen an Italian wine over a French wine a dozen years ago, I think you would be hard-pressed to find an American avoiding French wine."" Boycotts can backfire, such as when the president of Chick-fil-A provoked a consumer boycott by denouncing same-sex marriage and saying his fast-food chain backs the traditional family unit. Traditional family supporters, however, organized a counterboycott -- a ""buycott"" -- and even a ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day."" ""There were some groups that went and actually started frequenting Chick-fil-A more,"" Schweitzer noted. Corporate boycotts can yield more immediate results because CEOs can act faster than elected lawmakers, but the activism requires key ingredients: Consumers must care, customers must be able to easily shop elsewhere, issues must be understandable, and the boycott needs mass attention, often enhanced by speedy social media, Diermeier wrote in the Harvard Business Review last year. One successful effort was Greenpeace's 1995 boycott of Shell -- a specific target -- which reduced sales in Germany by 40%. The ""McCruelty: I'm Hatin' It"" campaign by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, however, has had ""limited impact"" on McDonald's because the issues are ""complex and not intuitive,"" especially in comparison with the more easily grasped notion of a fur boycott, Diermeier wrote. The analysts were pessimistic about a successful Florida boycott, even if Wonder is calling upon fans to avoid doing business in Florida and any other state with a ""stand your ground"" self-defense law. King, the civil rights scion, is also weighing a multistate boycott, such as against Georgia peaches because that state also has a ""stand your ground"" law. ""These are things that my father considered in his era,"" King said. But a Florida boycott faces overwhelming odds because it lacks an easy target and uses economic pressure to seek political change, experts say. Moreover, the gambit may even hurt African-Americans and other minorities because they often work in the Sunshine State's vast tourism industry. ""Business will suffer the least, and employees will suffer the most,"" said Pizam, the Florida tourism professor. ""It's good-intentioned people who don't realize the unintended negative consequences that will hurt the ones they want to help."" Added Schweitzer about a Florida boycott: ""It's ridiculous. It's an expression of frustration, and I think that frustration is valid. ""But I don't think there's sufficient groundswell to motivate a campaign that a boycott would require,"" he continued. ""For boycotts to be successful, people have to have easy alternatives. Either you're going to visit Grandma, or you're not. And there aren't easy alternatives."" Juror pushes for new laws following trial .","Boycotting state laws has a spotty record, analyst says .
Some boycotting Americans want Florida to repeal its 'stand your ground' law .
Arizona boycott led to $141 million in losses, but experts dispute its effect on laws .
Consumer boycott can succeed if public can easily shop elsewhere, analysts say ."
"(CNN) -- Overriding a veto by Arkansas' Democratic governor, the state's Republican-controlled House and Senate approved a bill to ban abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, the most restrictive such law in the country. Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, vetoed the bill Monday, saying it ""blatantly contradicts the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court."" But on Wednesday, the Arkansas House voted 56-33 to override the veto, following a 20-14 override vote a day earlier in the state Senate. The Center for Reproductive Rights and the ACLU of Arkansas promised to mount a legal challenge in federal court, while supporters said they were prepared to fight back. ""We intend to make it ... clear that no one's constitutional rights are subject to revision by lawmakers intent on scoring political points, and that attempts such as this to turn back the clock on reproductive rights will not stand,"" Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. Should the state lose the challenge, it will have to pay all the legal fees in the case. But Rep. Ann Clemmer, a Republican supporter, says the money would be well spent. ""Protecting unborn children is ... an important way to spend state resources,"" she told CNN affiliate KATV in Little Rock. Called the Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act, the bill requires testing to determine ""whether the fetus that the pregnant woman is carrying possesses a detectible heartbeat."" Abortions would be banned if the fetus has a detected heartbeat ""and is under 12 weeks or greater gestation."" Arkansas governor vetoes bill to ban abortions past 12 weeks . Roe v. Wade, a 1973 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, legalized the right to an abortion in all 50 states. Statutory time limits on when abortions can take place, however, vary from state to state. Some states have no time limit, while others allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester, about 27 or 28 weeks into the pregnancy. As is so often the case with this issue, there are deep divides. Kandi Cox, who had an abortion 20 years ago when she was 19, now heads Abba Adoption, an agency that offers support for women and teens who choose adoption rather than abortion for their unborn child. ""This is a day of celebration within our state, where we can say that we as the state of Arkansas, we stand for life,"" Cox told CNN affiliate KARK-TV. ""We're going to continue to fight until Arkansas stays a solid state for life."" But Jan Gerber, who also had an abortion, said she has no regrets about her decision to end her pregnancy. She is a registered nurse who signed a petition by Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health to support abortion providers. ""I stand for choice,"" Gerber told KARK. ""I stand for the little girl who thinks her voice has been taken away from her, and I'm 60 and I'm older and I want to say to that little girl, 'you do have a choice.'""

"(CNN) -- An impoverished South Korean gymnast has not only struck Olympic gold, but also reaped 500 million won (US$444,000) in the latest donation in a veritable rags to riches tale. For several years, Yang Hak-seon, who won South Korea's first ever Olympics gymnastics gold medal Monday, has been living with his parents in a small polytunnel in a rural area of Jeolla province, 200 kilometers southwest of the capital. Covered with thin wooden boards and plastic sheeting, the makeshift structure was nearly swept away during heavy rains two years ago, according to South Korean media. Why do Olympians bite their medals? As Yang's financial plight has come to light following his Olympic win in the men's vault final, companies have been rushing to provide for the newly-minted star. The latest donation of 500 million won (US$444,000) comes from the chairman of LG Group, Koo Bon Moo, who announced Thursday that the gift was intended to help Yang put aside financial worries and focus on his training. Yang, who said after his victory that he wanted to build a house for his family, will also have this wish come true, according to local media. The CEO of construction company Samla Group, announced earlier this week that he will build the athlete an apartment valued at US$190,000. Yang and his family will able to move into the apartment by the end of next year, Oh Woo-hyun said. Nongshim, the manufacturer of Yang's favorite instant noodles, has also said it will provide his family with ""limitless amount of instant noodles,"" according to a press statement. And if Yang's needs are not covered by corporate donations, he can use the 100 million won (US$88,800) personally donated to him by the head of the Korea Gymnastic Association. Few were aware of Yang's dire financial situation until the London Olympics, including his own coach. He only knew Yang as a young man with a natural gift for gymnastics, Cho Sung-doe told CNN in a phone interview. Cycling's glamor girl ponders next career move . Yang's story emerged only after his gold medal win. Yang and his family had been living in the polytunnel since his father lost his factory job due to injury several years ago, according to South Korean media reports. Since then, he has been supporting the family with his modest income from the Korea Gymnastic Association, supplementing the small wage his father earns for working part-time as a farmer, reports said. According to his Olympic profile, Yang started training in gymnastics at the age of nine. As a teenager he emerged as a contender in international competitions when he placed first in the vault event at the 2010 Asian Games. Performing his signature move, a triple-twisting front somersault, at the London Games, the 20-year-old talent recorded an average score of 16.533 in the men's vault final, pushing his closest rivals from Russia and Ukraine to second and third place. Yang first performed his winning somersault at the 2011 World Championships, where he took first place. The move has since been named ""the Yang.""

"(CNN) -- The shadow match fixing casts over football grew a shade darker Thursday after Britain's National Crime Agency confirmed seven arrests had been made as part of an ongoing investigation. Two men suspected of involvement have been charged with conspiracy to defraud bookmakers by influencing the course of football matches and placing bets thereon, the NCA said Thursday. Five of the seven arrested have made bail, the agency said. The arrests were made across Britain Tuesday and Wednesday as part of a probe into a ""suspected international illegal betting syndicate,"" said the NCA -- Britain's equivalent of U.S. law enforcement agency the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The NCA, which became operational in October, is working closely with the Gambling Commission and the Football Association, the organization which oversees English football. ""This is an active investigation and we are unable to provide further detail at this time."" The Gambling Commission, which regulates most gambling in Britain, is cooperating with the NCA in the investigation. ""The Gambling Commission has provided advice, intelligence and expertise in supporting this ongoing National Crime Agency investigation and continues to liaise with both the NCA and the Football Association,"" the body said in a statement. An investigation by British newspaper The Daily Telegraph claimed Asian match-fixers are targeting games in English professional football's lower levels. In a series of covert conversations recorded by the newspaper over the past two weeks, one of the arrested individuals claimed that lower league matches could be fixed for Â£50,000 ($81,500) and correctly forecast the outcome of three games played by the same team. The Football League, which runs the lower leagues of English professional soccer, said it was aware of media reports but it had not been contacted by the NCA. ""We understand from media reports that there is an ongoing police investigation into alleged match fixing in domestic football,"" said Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey. ""To date, we have had no contact from the police regarding this matter. ""The threat of corruption is a matter that the Football League and the other football authorities treat with the utmost seriousness. The integrity of our matches and our competitions is the bedrock of the domestic game."" Match fixing has plagued world soccer in recent years. Senior European crime fighters Europol announced in February it had probed 680 suspicious matches across the globe including two European Champions League matches, one of which was played in England. In Australia, four British players who spent part of last season with clubs in the Conference South have been arrested and charged for alleged match fixing in the Victoria Premier League this year.

"(CNN) -- A second man has been arrested in connection with last week's shooting at a Philadelphia high school, police said Monday. Donte Walker, 18, allegedly sold the gun that was fired inside the gymnasium of the Delaware Valley Charter School on Friday. The accused shooter, Raisheem Rochwell, 17, obtained the firearm from Walker just before the shooting, police said. Walker turned himself in to police on Saturday. Rochwell was reportedly going to be the target of an assault after school and may have requested the gun, according to police. Video footage shows the exchange of money and a black handgun between Walker and an unidentified male, police said. The gun was then handed to Rochwell inside the gymnasium, police said. According to investigators, Walker, a former student who graduated in 2013, was considered a ""guest"" and did not have to pass the metal detectors to enter. Walker is being charged with violation of Pennsylvania's Uniform Firearms Act, conspiracy and related offenses. Rochwell was arraigned Saturday as an adult. He faces charges including aggravated assault, violation of the Uniform Firearms Act, recklessly endangering another person and having a weapon on school property, according to police. The shooter was in the school gym with about seven other students, city police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. Some were playing basketball and others were standing in a corner when the shooter pulled a gun and fired. Around 3:30 p.m. the gun went off, striking an 18-year-old female student and a 17-year-old male student, police said. She was struck in the rear of the left arm, the bullet perforated her bicep and struck the boy in the shoulder. The students were taken to a local hospital Friday and have since been released. The investigation is ongoing. A 16-year-old male student had been in custody in connection with the shooting but was released because no charges were approved, police said.","Donte Walker, 18, is accused of selling the gun used in a school shooting .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Most of us have them -- the personal ritual to deal with the ""ick"" of a public bathroom: wiping the seat with toilet paper, using a paper seat cover or even rolling up several pieces of toilet paper to create a thicker barrier between the skin and ... the unknown. Public bathrooms may be teeming with bacteria, but the toilet seat is probably safe for sitting. But the toilet seat is actually the cleanest part of the bathroom, one expert says. Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona who has studied restrooms and other germ-infested environments for more than 20 years, says that because of the care people take when they're about to sit, other parts of the bathroom are much more prone to delivering bacterial infections. ""One of the cleanest things in the bathrooms we find are the toilet seats,"" Gerba said. ""I'd put my fanny on it any time -- unless it's wet; then you'd want to wipe it first.""  Avoiding bathroom 'hot spots' » . The Internet has come through for people who just want a clean place to go. New tools like MizPee (nationwide) and Diaroogle (New York only) will point you to the nearest public restroom and display extensive comments about those facilities from users, even delivering the information to your mobile phone. (Warning: CNN makes no promises about the cleanliness of the language in these bathroom locators.) MizPee launched a year ago for people in San Francisco, California, after co-founder Peter Olfe saw that the city's public library bathroom was ""so disgusting,"" said Dhana Pawar, vice president and co-founder of Yojo Mobile, which created MizPee. ""Unfortunately, [MizPee] was inspired by that trip."" Fueled by demand, MizPee has expanded to more than 22 cities in America and six in Europe, and has had more than 300,000 unique visitors. Users rate toilets on a scale from one to five toilet paper rolls and nominate the best and worst toilets for the Flush of the Year award. The site also gives users information on deals at restaurants, shops and services nearby, in addition to toilet trivia called ""looisms."" Women tend to have higher standards for bathroom cleanliness than men, often rating any given unisex bathroom lower than men, Pawar said. In general, many more women than men use the site, but male bikers and older men, especially colitis patients, also come to MizPee. Women are also particularly concerned about finding clean bathrooms with changing stations, Pawar said. ""You'd be surprised how few there are."" Pawar said she herself is ""really paranoid"" when it comes to the restroom. ""I'm one of those really anal people who have to have a clean bathroom,"" she said. For many people, public bathrooms generate feelings of anxiety, fear and disgust.   ""Basically, everybody is fearful of public restrooms,"" said Dr. Lisa Bernstein, assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine, who admitted that her mother always told her that she should never make direct contact with a toilet seat. Research indicates that fear of the commode itself may be misdirected. Public bathrooms may contain several kinds of harmful bacteria, including E. coli, salmonella, coliform, rotavirus, cold virus and the potentially deadly form of staph known as MRSA, experts say. But people are more likely to pick up these nasty bugs through touching things in the bathroom with their hands, not their behinds. ""I don't think anyone would voluntarily sit on a seat with urine, but, in reality, urine touching intact skin on the tush won't do anything,"" Bernstein said. More concerning, however, is a child who steadies himself or herself on a toilet seat by holding onto it and then leaving without washing hands, she said. Those germs could lead to an infection once the child's hands touch the nose, mouth or eyes. And don't forget that unwashed hands have handled everything from the door knob to the lock to the flusher. Again, if you touch one of these objects and then rub your eye, nose or mouth, you're apt to transmit that bacteria. But there is hope. Here are hygiene helpers:  Wash your hands . Yes, it's basic. But, in general, washing your hands is the most effective action you can take to prevent bacterial infections from a public bathroom, experts say. ""You can remove all gastrointestinal and respiratory infection bacteria by washing hands,"" said Judy Daly, clinical microbiologist at the University of Utah and spokesperson for the Clean Hands Campaign. ""Seventeen seconds of a little bit of friction, water and soap will really mediate bacteria."" The American Society for Microbiology, which sponsors the Clean Hands Campaign, found in a study last year that about 77 percent of men and women washed their hands in public restrooms, down 6 percent from 2005. The observational study also found that women washed their hands more than men. ""It's such an easy intervention,"" Daly said. ""If you get it to be a habit for a 30-day period, it's something you do automatically."" Use automatic devices . Recent bathroom additions like automatic hands-free faucets and paper towel dispensers diminish contact between your hands and bathroom items that may bear bacteria, Bernstein said. Don't let your belongings touch the floor . Gerba's research found that the highest concentration of germs in a public bathroom are on the floor, the outside of the sanitary napkin disposal and the sink and water taps. When Gerba looked at women's purses, he found that one-third of them had fecal bacteria on the bottom. Make sure you hang your shoulder bag on a hook. If none is available, some people swear by hanging the strap around their necks. Use the first stall . The middle stall of a public restroom usually has the most bacteria because people use it the most. ""I guess people like company,"" Gerba said. The first stall will probably be cleaner. Recognize the best and the worst . As a rule, the cleanest toilets are usually in hospitals, because they use disinfectants heavily, but the worst are in airports and airplanes, Gerba said. The small size of airplane bathrooms, including the sinks themselves, make it hard for people to wash their hands -- in fact, Gerba's study found a thin layer of E. coli in an airplane bathroom.   As for the airports themselves, ""In the men's room at Chicago O'Hare, I don't think the toilet seat ever gets cold,"" Gerba said. Don't hold back . It's fine for a woman to hover over the toilet seat if she doesn't want to sit down, but if she doesn't empty her bladder completely, she's at risk for a urinary infection, Bernstein said. ""You may be doing yourself more harm than good,"" she said.  Along the same lines, you can develop urinary infections from ""holding it in"" too long just because you don't want to use a particular facility. Better in a public stall than not at all. Put it in perspective . Although the bathroom seems like a nasty place, the possible infections from the dreaded stall are no different from the ones you can get anywhere else in public. ""They're the same bugs we transmit shaking hands,"" Bernstein said. ""People are more freaked out about restrooms, but the same thing applies anywhere in public."" After all that research -- he's had the cops called on him while prowling around bathroom floors -- Gerba has no problem with sitting down on public toilets. But Bernstein still uses one or two seat covers, ""because of what my mother taught me,"" she said.","New Web sites help find nearby public restrooms in the U.S. and abroad .

"(CNN) -- CNN and Turner Broadcasting System founder Ted Turner was admitted to a hospital while traveling in South America, his spokesman said Friday. The spokesman, Phillip Evans, did not indicate where specifically Turner was treated or for what ailment, saying ""it is our policy not to comment on his personal health."" Evans said that Turner was hospitalized ""for observation."" Argentina's state-run Telam news agency, reported that the 75-year-old was initially treated in Bariloche, a lakeside city near the Chilean border, about 1,500 kilometers (940 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires. Turner arrived at a clinic there around 4 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) suffering from acute abdominal pain, according to clinic spokeswoman Paula Redondo. She told Telam that Turner was with a personal nurse and assistant. Doctors diagnosed the media magnate and philanthropist with appendicitis and recommended that he undergo surgery. Turner was flown later that morning to the capital of Buenos Aires to have the operation, according to Telam. Soon after graduating from Brown University and serving in the U.S. Coast Guard, Turner took over the family business -- Turner Advertising -- in 1963. Seven years later, he bought TV stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Atlanta to kickstart a media empire that would one day include TBS, TNT, HLN, Cartoon Network, TCM and CNN, which launched in 1980. In 1996, Turner sold Turner Broadcasting to Time Warner, though he remained active in the business for several more years. Besides his business ventures -- including the Ted's Montana Grill chain and the renewable energy company RT Solar -- Turner has been one of the United States most generous philanthropists, including a $1 billion donation to the United Nations in 1997. CNN's Robert Lenz contributed to this report.","Spokesman: Ted Turner is admitted to a hospital while in South America .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey mother is under arrest, accused of keeping her 10-year-old son chained to a radiator in her bedroom for the past two weeks. Florence Pollard, 31, and her boyfriend, Brian Craig, 29, were arrested Monday and charged with endangering the welfare of a child and criminal restraint, the Camden County Police Department said. Police say the boy managed to escape from the home Monday afternoon. He was spotted by a neighbor, who alerted authorities. When police arrived, the child told them that he was chained in his mother's bedroom day and night as punishment and that he had to sleep uncovered on the floor. He also said that his hands were occasionally restrained by plastic zip ties. Hate crimes alleged in holding of captives in Philly boiler room .

"(CNN) -- The world is holding its breath for the informal summit between U.S. President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in California. Will Obama and Xi look into each other's eyes and see each other as a partner to trust? Will they be able to set the tone for the China-U.S. relations for years, if not decades, to come? I had the privilege of accompanying two Chinese Presidents to the White House in 1985 and 1987, and being invited as a guest to the White House when Chinese President Hu Jintao was welcomed by President George W. Bush in April 2006. Such China-U.S. summits have been known for both the substance of the meetings as well as the pomposity and the glamorous bells and whistles of high diplomacy. By agreeing to meet without the red carpet and 21-gun salute, both Obama and Xi have demonstrated pragmatism and commitment to focusing on the most important, urgent issues between China and the U.S. as well as in the world. Xi should be given credit for his vision, courage and wisdom in agreeing with Obama to build up personal rapport and trust between the two most important persons in the world. While there have been numerous channels of communications between Beijing and Washington, including the biannual Sino-US Economic and Strategic Dialogue, what is sorely lacking between China and the U.S. is that trust at the very top. What is encouraging is that, unlike the zero-sum game between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union in the Cold War era, today the U.S. and China are the two largest economies in the world, and highly integrated with each other. The bilateral trade this year will be far beyond $500 billion, larger than the GDP of many countries. The exchange of people, students, goods, information and investment between the two countries has been breaking records year after year. Of course, given their different histories, cultural backgrounds, political systems and values, China and the U.S. will hardly ever be exactly alike, with friction inevitable between the two countries. The challenges are how to establish a sound mechanism to handle such friction effectively and in a timely manner, and how to build common ground and mutual interest so that both countries benefit from increasing trade and exchange. Furthermore, as the two largest economies and most important countries in the world, the more China and the U.S. can see eye to eye on major international issues, the easier it will be to prevent escalation of international crises -- and the more effective they can be at solving them. In recent years, I have been using ""AmeriChina"" to describe the high expectations of the future of China-U.S. relations. The term, which ranks America and China alphabetically and in order of their relative importance, is better than ""Chimerica"" which defies the more logical way of ranking China and the U.S. The sense of shared destiny encapsulated in the concept of ""AmeriChina"" will help foster a new way of looking at the China-U.S. relations. In this spirit, let's give our best wishes to the Obama-Xi informal summit in California, and work collectively to make ""AmeriChina"" a reality. AmeriChina will be good for America, good for China, and good for the rest of the world.","Gao: What is sorely lacking between China and the U.S. is trust at the top .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- After the thousands of dead pigs, come the tons of poisoned fish. The Fuhe River is the scene of the latest disturbing example of river pollution in China. Authorities cleared about 110 tons of dead fish from a 40-kilometer section of the river in the central province of Hubei, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported Wednesday. Images taken at the scene this week showed thousands of silvery fish carcasses blanketing large expanses of the river and its shore. The cause of the deaths, provincial environmental officials said, was the discharge of high levels of ammonia into the water by a local chemical plant in Yingcheng, outside the city of Wuhan. Kite detects pollution, shines light on Beijing smog . Samples taken at a water outlet from the plant on Tuesday indicated that ammonia density reached 196 milligrams per liter, a level ""far in excess of the national standard,"" Xinhua reported, citing the provincial environmental protection department. The World Health Organization says that natural levels of ammonia in groundwater are normally below 0.2 milligrams per liter and that surface waters can contain as much as 12 milligrams per liter. The Hubei environmental authorities ordered the company that runs the plant, Hubei Shuanghuan Science and Technology Stock Co., to suspend operations at the plant and sort out its pollution controls, Xinhua said. CNN made repeated calls for comment Thursday, but the company's office line was busy. Its stock was suspended from trading on the Shenzhen stock exchange Wednesday. In an update Thursday, the environmental protection department said that a recent drought in the area had ""caused (a) significant drop in water level, which decreased the river's capacity to hold pollutants."" Domestic sewage mixed with untreated waste from the chemical plant and a paper mill ""have caused the biological crisis"" in the river, the department said in a statement. Great green blob covers Chinese waters . 'Serious' pollution problems . A villager who lives near the river, Li Songqing, told the local newspaper Chutian Metropolitan that the dead fish had been piling up since early Monday. ""Nearly all fish died out in this section, no matter if they were big or small,"" he said. Environmentalists said this added to other problems in the area. ""The environment of this region is already under extreme stress,"" said Ma Tianjie, who manages Greenpeace's campaign against toxic chemicals in East Asia. ""The addition of these incidents will definitely worsen the situation."" People on China's Twitter-like microblog service, Weibo, reacted to the news with a mixture of anger and sarcasm. ""Why can't we solve these problems and stop them from happening beforehand?"" asked the user @Kanfangzu. ""The water quality must be fine, and this is just a mass suicide of the fish,"" quipped another user, @Niyaobuyaolianguidouhaipa. The poisoning of the fish is the most recent pollution scandal in China, which has many rivers and lakes with water quality problems. In a 2009 report, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said pollution of surface water ""remained serious."" In the ministry's most recent report, it said that about 30% of the rivers that it monitors are considered to be polluted. Earlier this year, the discovery of thousands of bloated pig carcasses in a river near Shanghai caused widespread alarm. At the time, officials blamed local pig farmers for dumping the dead animals in the river. CNN's Dayu Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.","Authorities have cleared about 110 tons of dead fish from the Fuhe River .

"(CNN) -- The National Football League wants to make it clear that tailgating will not be banned at Super Bowl XLVIII. But fans won't be allowed to spread out their pregame festivities like they did in the regular season. The blueprint of New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on February 2, 2014, will look vastly different than it did in the regular season, according to NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy. MetLife Stadium will need to secure 15,000 of its 28,000 available parking spaces for security and media purposes, leaving 13,000 parking spots for the expected 80,000 ticket-holders, McCarthy said. Fans will still be able to bring food and beverages, just like they would for a regular season game; and the ""no lit flame"" rule will still apply -- enacted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. But fans will not be allowed to take up multiple parking spots for their blacktop bashes, McCarthy said. According to the MetLife Stadium parking guidelines, all tailgating items must be set up in front of or behind one vehicle. ""When people think of tailgating, they think of grilling, setting up tents, taking four or five different parking spots,"" McCarthy said. Allowing only one spot per car shouldn't be a problem because the majority of Super Bowl XLVIII spectators are expected to use mass transit to get to the game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, McCarthy explained. The NFL expects nearly 80% of ticket holders to use mass transit that Sunday, which should leave enough parking spaces for the 16,000-20,000 fans who are expected to drive to the game, he said. Confining fans to the boundaries of their allotted parking spaces isn't new, McCarthy said. ""Every Super Bowl since 9-11, we've had a policy where fans can bring their own food and drink and enjoy them from their spot in a parking lot,"" he said.

"Bethesda, Maryland (CNN) -- Tucked away on the sprawling campus of the National Institutes of Health, an elite team of doctors and researchers search for clues to solve medical mysteries that have eluded a diagnosis. They're detectives for a one-of-a-kind initiative at the NIH. It's called the Undiagnosed Diseases Program or UDP. Together, the UDP's team focuses its vast expertise on trying to save patients' lives and creating new science. Dr. William Gahl is the clinical director of NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute and the Undiagnosed Diseases Program's lead investigator. ""The mission is really two-fold,"" Gahl says. ""One is to try to get to a diagnosis for people who have struggled for so long to achieve a diagnosis -- of course there all kinds of benefits to that. The second is to discover new diseases or new aspects of known diseases so we can help the entire community of individuals with related disorders."" For many people with mysterious conditions, the UDP is their last hope for a diagnosis. ""We try and be realistic about it, and get our patients to be realistic about the issues too,"" Gahl says. ""So the first day of a typical visit, I'll go in and tell the patients, 'You've been to the best places in the country, now you're coming here. We only have a 10 to 15 percent success rate. So I don't want you to get your hopes up really too, too high.' But on the other hand, we don't want to take all hope away."" There are an estimated 6,800 rare diseases in the world, according to the NIH. The NIH defines a rare disease as one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. But then there are other disorders that have yet to reach the diagnosis stage. That's where Gahl and his team come in. They take on the impossible with the hope that new science can be created. ""It's really sort of the inspiration we all have as clinical researchers,"" says Gahl. Created as a government pilot program in 2008, the UDP has received more than 3,000 inquiries. But it has only accepted slightly more than 300 patients. To be considered for the UDP, a patient must be referred by a doctor and have his or her case well-documented in medical records. Gahl and a panel of experts then have the difficult job of selecting who will be accepted. ""I have to take some solace in the fact that even though we're turning down a lot of people, we're still helping a chosen few,"" Gahl says. Those chosen few head to NIH's clinical center for a week of complex and exhaustive tests. The clinical center is the world's largest hospital devoted to clinical research and allows the UDP team to perform around-the-clock testing with state-of-the-art technology. But what makes the UDP truly unparalleled is its collective approach to every case. It is designed to call upon experts throughout NIH's 27 institutes to look not only at their individual areas of specialty, but how those specialized areas fit into the bigger puzzle. After one week, the patients are sent home. That's when the real detective work begins for Gahl and his team. Using the process of elimination, they pursue every option and sift through every clue, hoping it leads them to a diagnosis. ""This is a different paradigm."" Gahl says. ""So this to me is the perfect amalgam of the training in knowledge -- having acquired a certain fund of knowledge -- and then applying it to cases that are not yet solved. So I find that extremely stimulating."" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's death instantly changed the lives of his family and friends. The weeks immediately after the pop icon died were chaotic, and many questions are still unanswered for those closest to Jackson. Michael's children . The day their father died, Prince Michael, 13, Paris, 12, and Blanket, 8, moved in with their grandmother Katherine Jackson at the Encino, California, home where Michael once lived with his family. The home is filled with memories of their father, including many photos of a young Michael Jackson. The theater room of the large house was converted into a classroom where they've been home-schooled for the past year. The grassy yard of the Encino estate is often filled with Michael's kids playing ball with four cousins -- the sons of Jackson brothers Jermaine and Randy -- who have lived there the past year with their mother. They share a computer with internet access, which resulted in fans getting a rare and candid look at Blanket's dancing, acting and light saber skills when several videos were uploaded to YouTube in April. While Jackson kept his children shrouded in privacy during his life, they have appeared at a handful of public events to honor their father since his death. Paris made the world cry at the end of a memorial for her father when she said, ""Ever since I was born, daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine."" Paris and her older brother took the stage at the 2010 Grammy Awards to accept their father's lifetime achievement award. ""To all his songs, his message was simple, love,"" Prince Michael said. ""We will continue to spread his message and help the world."" The three children traveled to Gary, Indiana, this week for their first visit to their father's first home. They will take part in a tribute there, along with Katherine Jackson and their grandfather Joe Jackson. Michael's mother . Katherine Jackson's main focus since her son's death has been caring for his three children. A Los Angeles judge immediately gave her temporary custody, which became permanent after Debbie Rowe, the mother of the two oldest children, agreed not to challenge her. Michael's 80-year-old mother waged a legal fight for several months for control of Jackson's estate, but gave up her probate challenge in October. She and Jackson's children are the main beneficiaries of the estate. For now, they are receiving an $86,000 monthly family allowance. Katherine Jackson and her husband have attended every hearing in the criminal case against Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in their son's death. She has only recently begun speaking publicly about her son's death, giving a handful of media interviews. Katherine Jackson also posted a YouTube video this month announcing her support for a tribute to Michael Jackson to be held June 26 in Beverly Hills, California. Although Katherine and Joe Jackson have been married for 61 years, they do not usually share a home. Michael's father . In the weeks after Michael Jackson's death, Joe Jackson -- his children call him Joseph -- denied allegations that he physically abused his son during his Jackson 5 days. ""Never. Never have. And I -- and I raised him just like you would raise your kids, you know? But harm Michael, for what? I have no reason. That's my son. I loved him and I still love him,"" Jackson told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in August. Joe Jackson has been outspoken and active in raising questions about his son's death. Jackson has called for a more serious charge than involuntary manslaughter against Murray. He recently filed a complaint with the California Medical Board against AEG, the company that was producing the comeback concerts. The complaint accused AEG of neglecting to provide the recommended medical equipment and a nurse who was supposed to assist Dr. Murray. Those measures could have prevented the singer's death or revived Jackson when he stopped breathing, according to the complaint. Michael's father also plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray on Friday, the anniversary of his son's death. Jackson, not mentioned in his son's 2002 will, has an ongoing legal challenge against the men named as executors in the document. The probate judge has ruled against him, but it is under appeal. While Jackson, 80, receives a monthly Social Security check, he depended on financial support from his son. That ended with his son's death. He petitioned the probate court to award him $15,000 a month in support, but the request is still pending. Jackson, who lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, has been promoting his vision of a Jackson family museum and entertainment center in Gary, Indiana. Michael's siblings . Michael Jackson's five brothers and three sisters have, at times, come together as a family since his death. But, as with many large families, they each follow their own paths. Brothers Jackie, Jermaine, Tito and Marlon appeared together on an A&E Network reality show last fall that followed their attempt to record and perform again as a musical group. The series ended after six episodes with no new songs and no public performances. Brother Randy chose not to take part in the show. Jermaine Jackson has been the most visible publicly, traveling around the world to promote his own projects and Michael Jackson's legacy. He recently performed a tribute concert to his brother in Gambia. Sister Janet has stayed busy with her acting and music career, which included roles in two Tyler Perry movies in the past year. La Toya Jackson has been outspoken in her belief that Michael Jackson was the victim of a criminal conspiracy to kill him. She has attended each of Murray's court hearings. Rebbie Jackson, the oldest of the Jackson siblings, recently resumed her singing career. However, she has mostly remained out of the spotlight. Michael's ex-wife . Debbie Rowe is a former nurse who married Michael Jackson in 1996, gave birth to his two oldest children and then agreed to a divorce settlement in 1999. Prince Michael and Paris remained with their father. In the weeks after Jackson's death, Rowe considered a legal challenge for custody of the children. She finally reached an agreement with Katherine Jackson that would allow her supervised visits with the children under guidelines to be recommended by a child psychologist. It is unclear if the children know Rowe is their mother. Michael's doctors . Murray lost his only patient when Jackson died a year ago. It was several months before Murray resumed his medical practices in Houston, Texas, and Las Vegas, Nevada. He never got paid the $150,000 monthly salary he was owed for the two months he was Jackson's personal physician while the pop star rehearsed in Los Angeles for his comeback concerts, Murray's lawyer said. Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death in February. The judge refused to suspend his California medical license, although Murray cannot personally administer anesthesia on patients. The maximum sentence if convicted is four years in prison. His preliminary hearing, which is expected to last at least a week, could begin in late September. A trial could be held next year. Dr. Arnold Klein, Jackson's dermatologist and longtime friend, was never criminally implicated in Jackson's death, although drug agents did subpoena medical records from his office. Klein hinted in an interview that he may have been a sperm donor for Jackson's children. His lawyer unsuccessfully appeared at a probate hearing last summer to seek a role for Klein in the children's lives. Michael's money . When Jackson died, he was nearly $500 million in debt, according to a source familiar with his estate who is not authorized to speak about financial matters. In the year since, the debt has been reduced to about $300 million, the source said. The remaining debt is ""very manageable"" considering the income flowing into the estate, the source said. Sony Music, which recently signed a $250 million recording contact with Jackson's estate, said fans bought 31 million Jackson albums in the past year. Sony's film division also paid $60 million to produce the ""This Is It"" documentary that was a global blockbuster last year. The estate also has a steady flow of cash from the rights to 250 Beatles songs that Jackson shares with Sony. Merchandising rights, a Cirque du Soleil deal and a memorabilia tour have also brought in millions to the estate. Jackson's estate is being administered by John Branca, an entertainment lawyer, and John McClain, a former music executive, who were named executors in the 2002 will. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff has not made a final ruling on who will have permanent control of the estate.","Jackson's kids are no longer hidden from public view .

"(CNN) -- It's been quite some time since someone made fun of me for being from New Jersey. But the Gov. Chris Christie bridge scandal is bringing the old Joisey stereotypes back into play. ""New Jersey smells bad,"" ""New Jersey drivers are the worst!"" and, quite possibly the most inaccurate accusation, ""Jersey made Snooki and J-Woww!"" (Not ours! They're both from New York.) We're not a boorish population living in an industrial wasteland. The same old disparaging remarks have made Garden Staters thick-skinned underdogs. I'm convinced the New Jersey Turnpike was built to keep outsiders out, because the concrete blight along many stretches shows no evidence of why Jersey is called the Garden State. Once you get off on any exit, you will see Jersey is so much more than what most saw in the ""Sopranos"" introduction. I'm here to clear the air: New Jersey is one of the most underestimated states in the country. Don't knock it until you've traveled it. Want to give it a try? Here are six spots to check out from north to south. Jersey City . Go on a food tour of diverse Jersey City. You'll find authentic and affordable Mexican food at Taqueria, a savory crepe at French restaurant Madame Claude's, new American food using seasonal, local ingredients at Thirty Acres, and don't miss Marco and Pepe's for brunch (three words: croissant French toast). Once you've sufficiently indulged, catch a movie at the Loew's Jersey Theatre, a not-for-profit historic landmark built in 1929 that has hosted the likes of Bing Crosby, Duke Ellington, Jean Harlow, Bob Hope and, more recently, the American rock band Neutral Milk Hotel. Cool, right? If you want to get in touch with mother nature in this densely populated area, head north for a hike or bike ride in beautiful Palisades Interstate Park, a historic national landmark, and one of my favorite places in the world. West New York, New Jersey . Hungry after the hiking and biking? Luckily you're minutes away from some of the best Hispanic food in the tri-state area in West New York. Head over to Bergenline Avenue, the longest commercial avenue in New Jersey, and go for a nice long urban stroll with ample people-watching, shopping and eats from El Salvadorean to Mexican to Peruvian or Cuban. So many choices. Having trouble deciding? Start stretching your stomach at Dulce de Leche, an Argentine cafe and bakery where magical dulce de leche pastries and beef, chicken, ham, cheese or spinach empanadas are made with mucho amor. Princeton . If you're looking for a mix of history, an art scene and tree-lined streets, then you're hankering for Princeton. Fancy. Take a walking tour of Princeton University's Ivy League campus, which dates to 1754. It's well worth it. As for art, you'll want to head over to the Princeton University Art Museum, which houses more than 72,000 works of art. After soaking in all that art and culture, stop for a treat. Now, while I've heard the Bent Spoon is where ""the party is at"" for their gelatos, I can only vouch for Thomas Sweet Ice Cream on Nassau Street. They're famous for their blend-ins, way before a chain ice cream shop became popular for it. Since you're already on Nassau Street, you might as well shop. It only makes sense. Bookstores, dining spots and gift shops, oh my! Frenchtown . Now that you're an unofficial Garden Stater, you'll want to get in your car and drive (it's what we do) to Frenchtown, along the banks of the Delaware River. Rolling hills, green fields and scenic views support the state's lush moniker. If you're there anywhere from May to September, slap on some sunscreen and go for a gentle tube ride or some rafting. For those looking for some imported furniture or home decor from Southeast Asia, go to Two Buttons, owned by the author of ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" Elizabeth Gilbert, and her husband. Asbury Park . Now, as the locals say, we're ""going down the shore."" Out-of-towners have a stale notion of caked layers of fake tanning spray and so-called guidos galore along the Jersey Shore, thanks to the MTV show. The state's coast is actually defined by its historic boardwalks, arcades and amusement parks thick with nostalgia. When I want to stay close to the tri-state area but still want to feel like I went on a mini-getaway, I go to Asbury Park. I love it's old-timey charm, boardwalk, lounges and restaurants, and, of course, beaches. It never gets completely packed with people, so you'll find some peace and quiet. If you're a Bruce Springsteen fan (of course you are, who isn't!?), you should make it a point to go to the historic Stone Pony, where he got his start. Not far is Asbury Lanes, another no-frills but fun music venue and vintage bowling alley. Cape May . Finally, for a real getaway, keep driving south until you reach the southern tip of Jersey and charming and quaint Cape May, which stakes a claim as the nation's oldest seaside resort. A National Historic Landmark, Cape May is filled with lovely Victorian homes. You can stroll on the boardwalk, visit the historic Cape May lighthouse, go whale or dolphin watching or go wine tasting at the Cape May Winery. Embrace your inner Jersey girl and enjoy some of the Garden State's finer things before the rest of the out-of-towners catch on. But if you don't, it's no skin off our back. More for us.","New Jersey is the butt of jokes once again, thanks to its governor .

"(CNN) -- ""He's so good,"" Phil Everly said. We were sitting in a corner booth at a rural cafeteria in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. Phil was talking about his older brother, Don. Having spent time with the Everly Brothers on the rock-and-roll road over the years, I had long noticed something: . Whenever they were performing, Phil fastened his eyes right on Don's. As they were creating their heartbreaking harmonies, he seldom looked away. I didn't want to ask him about that in front of his brother, but, with just the two of us there, I did. ""I have to pay attention every second with my harmonies,"" Phil said. ""It's like playing tennis with someone who is really great. You can't let your mind wander for even a microsecond, or you'll be left behind."" When Phil died this month at the age of 74, I recalled that conversation. I first met him and Don during my years on tour with Jan and Dean; there were occasions when we found ourselves as part of shows at the same venues, sharing the same backstage areas, dining at the same pre-concert buffets. There are a lot of unlikely things that I managed to become used to during those years, but one thing I could never get over -- one thing that never ceased to feel like a dream -- was knowing the Everly Brothers. Their talent, the beauty of their voices, was something not entirely of this Earth. They were a miracle. I was still of elementary school age when, early one morning, the clock radio snapped to life and before I could open my eyes a new song sounded in the darkness: ""Bye Bye Love,"" two voices blending in a way I'd never heard before, and it was electric, it was that kind of unanticipated jolt. The disc jockey said the singers were called the Everly Brothers, and the thought that I would ever meet them, get to know them, travel with them, would not have seemed possible. But such things, if you're very lucky, can happen. In the days after Phil's death, the tributes to him from fellow musicians made me understand anew that, as famous and accomplished as those singers are, they, too, were in awe of him. Paul McCartney said that he and John Lennon used to pretend they were the Everly Brothers: ""When John and I first started to write songs, I was Phil and he was Don. Years later when I finally met Phil, I was completely starstruck and at the same time extremely impressed by his humility and gentleness of soul."" Paul Simon: ""Phil and Don were the most beautiful sounding duo I ever heard."" Vince Gill: ""I honestly believe I've spent the last 40 years, on every record I've been part of for somebody else, trying to be an Everly. ... I've spent my whole life chasing that beautiful, beautiful blend."" In the five years starting in 1957 they had 25 top-40 hits -- ""Bye Bye Love,"" ""Wake Up Little Susie,"" ""All I Have to Do Is Dream,"" ""Cathy's Clown,"" ""(Til) I Kissed You,"" ""Let It Be Me,"" so many others -- but the numbers are the least of it. The sound of their voices was so pure, so achingly gorgeous, that to listen was to be humbled and filled with wonder. It's not surprising at all that, across the Atlantic Ocean, of course the young-and-unknown Paul McCartney and the young-and-unknown John Lennon would listen to the Everlys on imported-from-the-U.S. records and try to be just like them. When I heard that Phil had died, I sat and did my best to recall moments in his presence, not wanting to forget a single second of them. He was soft-spoken and seemingly quite shy; there was an underlay of pain that somehow felt omnipresent, and that he didn't feel compelled to dwell upon. Music fans remember the death of Buddy Holly in 1959, but few recall the funeral. Phil did: He, not yet old enough to vote, was one of Holly's pallbearers. Whatever may have hurt and disheartened Phil, he didn't bother other people with, but you could find it in his music. The first words to a song he wrote later in 1959, and that he and Don recorded: ""I've been made blue / I've been lied to / When will I be loved?"" The fact that he and Don went through long periods of estrangements and silence is not a secret, but the silences ended each time a show began. The breathtaking sound of those voices intertwining was enough to bring listeners to tears. On Labor Day weekend in 1999 they made a trip together to the woods and hills of the part of Kentucky coal country where their father had gone to work in the mines at the age of 12. I was writing a column for Life magazine at the time; the Everlys invited me to come along. Don and Phil drove separate cars. I rode with Don up Route 431 in Muhlenberg County. He said: ""The town where I was born doesn't exist anymore. It was called Brownie -- just a few miles from here. It was a coal mining camp. When the coal was all gone, they tore the town down."" Later that day I sat in that bare-bones cafeteria with Phil, and he told me: ""There's an acceptance of us here. They know who we are. They know our kin."" The brothers, on the strength of their hits, found a life for themselves far from the old coal mines. But if they never quite fit in with the gleaming and glitzy rock idols who were their fan-magazine-cover contemporaries, it's probably because, as boys, they had so little in common with the others. ""I had this haunted feeling all my life,"" Don said to me one day in Kentucky. ""Of being odd man out."" I told Don what Phil had said: how Phil had explained his reason for staring into Don's eyes as they sang, how Phil had said how much he admired his brother's gift. Don told me: ""It's like a third person. When Phil and I sing, there are times that what comes out is not either of us, but the voice of a third person."" On that trip we had been joined by the great Life photographer Harry Benson. Late one afternoon, by the shore of Lake Adela, with forest all around, the four of us watched the sun getting ready to set. There had been a drought -- little rain for summer months on end. The brothers stood there in the quiet and then Phil turned to Don, gestured toward the treeline, and said: ""It's browner this year."" Don, looking toward the water's surface, said: ""The lake's down."" The shorthand of home. Whatever friction may have divided them from time to time, they never took it out on their audiences. When I asked Phil about it -- the constant effort to excel -- he said: ""We've never tried to fluff it. We've always tried to make it better."" That they did. One of my favorite songs of theirs was never a major hit: ""Gone, Gone, Gone."" Yet with Phil's passing the thought occurs that, because of the music he and Don gave us, he, and they, never will be gone. And that long-ago question of Phil's -- ""When will I be loved?"" -- has an easy answer: Forever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: The Everly Brothers had a talent that was extraordinary .

"(CNN) -- An Australian commission is hearing allegations of the physical and sexual abuse of boys in the care of the Salvation Army over several decades. The shocking treatment at some of the organization's boys homes included rape, beatings, locking boys in cages and, in one case, forcing a boy to eat his own vomit, the commission was told Tuesday. The public hearings, taking place in Sydney, are part of a wide-ranging investigation into how Australian institutions responded to cases of child sexual abuse. The current phase is focusing on the Salvation Army's response to abuse that took place in four of its boys homes in the states of Queensland and New South Wales in the 1960s and '70s. 'The greatest failure' The Salvation Army isn't denying the abuse, which came to light previously. It has apologized, admitting that hundreds of boys suffered in its care. ""This hearing will bring to light the greatest failure in the history of the Salvation Army in Australia,"" the group's counsel, Kate Eastmann, said Tuesday, according to CNN affiliate Seven Network. The four homes at the heart of the hearings were identified by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse as those where the most complaints of abuse were made to The Salvation Army. The homes -- Indooroopilly and Riverview in Queensland, and Bexley and Gill in New South Wales -- were all closed by 1980. Punishment and abuse . The commission on Tuesday heard accounts of unusually brutal or humiliating punishment, including a case at one home in which two boys were locked in cages on a verandah. ""Other forms of punishment included sweeping the playground with a toothbrush, cleaning 50 pairs of shoes, cleaning the pigeon cage and on one occasion, forcing a boy to eat his own vomit,"" said Simeon Beckett, the counsel assisting the commission. Allegations of widespread sexual assault carried out by Salvation Army officers and some of the boys under their supervision were also outlined. At the Bexley home, members of the public also abused boys, Beckett said, possibly with the knowledge of Salvation Army staff members. ""These persons had access to the boys' dormitories at night and would access the dormitories and sexually assault the boys,"" he said. Complaints dismissed . Evidence suggests that many of the boys didn't complain about the sexual abuse at the time because they feared punishment or retribution, Beckett said. Those who did complain weren't generally taken seriously. ""In cases when abuse was reported, the boys were often disbelieved and were punished for reporting what were characterized as 'lies,'"" he told the hearing. Some of the former residents of the homes who are due to testify over the course of the hearings are expected to say that ""even when they ran away from the homes and told police of what had occurred, they were returned to the home where they were then physically punished,"" Beckett said. Other witnesses due to appear before the commission include staff members from the homes and officials from law enforcement, the government and the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army has made payments to many of the victims of the abuses. ""The Salvation Army feels deep regret for every instance of child sexual abuse inflicted on children in our care,"" the organization says in a statement on its website. ""We are grieved that such things happened. We acknowledge that it was a failure of the greatest magnitude.""

"(Wired) -- The timeline for autonomous cars hitting the road en masse keeps getting closer. GM's Cadillac division expects to produce partially autonomous cars at a large scale by 2015, and the automaker also predicts it will have fully autonomous cars available by the end of the decade. Audi and BMW have also shown self-driving car concepts, with the former working with Stanford to pilot a modified TT up Pikes Peak. Meanwhile, Google is ripping along at its own rapid pace with a fleet of fully autonomous Toyota Prius hybrids that have logged over 300,000 miles. And the company has pushed through legislation that legalizes self-driving cars in Nevada. California is close behind, and Google has also been busy lobbying joyriding lawmakers in Washington, D.C. But while we know that robo-cars are coming, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) recently released predictions that autonomous cars will account for up to 75 percent of vehicles on the road by the year 2040. The organization went even further, forecasting how infrastructure, society and attitudes could change when self-driving cars become the norm around the middle of the century. IEEE envisions an absence of traffic signs and lights since highly evolved, self-driving cars won't need them, and it believes that full deployment could even eliminate the need for driver's licenses. Google gets license to operate driverless cars in Nevada . While this all sounds sci-fi, we're already starting to see separate threads of this autonomous-car future being weaved in current real-world tests. It's been assumed that the largest hurdle for autonomous cars is building the infrastructure. Not so, says Dr. Alberto Broggi, IEEE senior member and professor of computer engineering at the University of Parma in Italy. Broggi, the director of a 2010 project that successfully piloted two driverless cars on an 8,000-mile road trip from Parma to Shanghai, points out that two current types of self-driving cars will need less infrastructure, not more. ""The Google cars are based on very precise maps and they have sensing primarily based on a LIDAR technology,"" he told Wired. ""The cars that we tested on the route from Parma to Shanghai had no maps, and had sensing primarily based on cameras. In both cases, the cars have no help from the infrastructure."" When reached for comment, a Google spokesman declined to make a statement on this story and IEEE's predictions on autonomous cars. But Broggi also delineates between what he sees as different levels of self-driving technology as the features mature, and adds that infrastructure in the form of centralized communication once large numbers of autonomous cars are on the road will be crucial -- and have the greatest impact. This could lead to traffic lights, speed limits and even driver licensing disappearing. ""Autonomous cars alone will bring limited benefits,"" he says. ""They would be able to locate obstacles, avoid them and follow the road. But efficient autonomous operations would also require that vehicles coordinate with each other."" A nascent form of vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V) is currently being tested in a NHTSA field trial in Ann Arbor, allowing cars to share situational data to avoid crashing into each other. Meanwhile, Volvo is testing the concept of using ""road trains"" in Europe to allow for more efficient driving. ""A train of vehicles moving very close to each other would reach a higher throughput -- the number of cars per road unit -- and have lower fuel consumption due to aerodynamic drift,"" says Broggi. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication would also allow vehicles to share their position, destination and intended route with a central station, Broggi continues, that could coordinate and dispatch information about traffic and route vehicles accordingly. ""Suppose all cars are connected and a central station knows precisely their position and destination,"" Broggi says. ""The central station can send speed adjustment commands to the vehicles that enter an intersection in such a way that they do not collide and they occupy the intersection area one at a time, optimizing their movements. In this case, traffic lights will not be required since coordination is reached at a higher level."" We're already seeing a basic form of this in testing going on in Europe that combines V2V and V2I communication, collectively known as V2X. IEEE also foresees autonomous vehicles accelerating car sharing and helping make it more widespread, especially for people within a wider range of ages and physical abilities. And driverless cars may even eliminate the need for driver's licenses. ""People do not need a license to sit on a train or a bus,"" said Azim Eskandarian, director of the IEEE's Center for Intelligent Systems Research, in a statement. ""In a full-autonomy case in which no driver intervention will be allowed, the car will be operating. So there will not be any special requirements for drivers or occupants to use the vehicle as a form of transportation."" IEEE also predicts that the biggest barrier to pervasive adoption of driverless cars may have nothing to do with technology, but will be general public acceptance. While the average driver may grasp the basic benefits of autonomous cars -- increased fuel efficiency and safety, along with a reduction in traffic -- it may not be enough to get them to let go of the steering wheel. Jeffrey Miller, IEEE member and associate professor of computer systems engineering at the University of Alaska-Anchorage, believes that baby steps in the form of driver assist systems may help. ""As more vehicular controls begin being automated, such as parallel parking and automatic braking, people will become more accepting of autonomous technologies,"" Miller told Wired. ""So by 2040, driverless vehicles will be widely accepted and possibly be the dominant vehicles on the road."" Overheard on CNN.com: Autonomous cars reduce 'crashes'? Press any key to continue .

"(CNN) -- After arriving in Senegal in 1974, I lived in a small village near ThiÃ¨s for three years. It was here that I realized a lack of basic, life-saving information was causing so much unnecessary illness, tragedy and death: Two children in the village were lame from polio; ordinary wounds became infected and led to hospital stays; there were many cases of measles; a baby died from dehydration. It was also here that I began to understand why development projects have often failed and why they have even disempowered people at the community level. To try a different approach, I partnered with the Senegalese villagers to design and implement a basic education program in African languages, and in 1991, I set up a nonprofit organization, Tostan, to continue that work. In this program, people who had never been to school were for the first time able to understand why vaccinations are important, how to treat wounds in the village and how to ensure simple diarrhea does not lead to dehydration and death. Watch an interview with Molly Melching . It was not until 1996, however, that we had a real ""breakthrough"" (which is incidentally what Tostan means in the Wolof language) when we added a learning module on human rights and responsibilities to our program. The results were transformational. By providing a framework of human rights by which women, men and adolescents could discuss new information and issues that were important to them, we saw, for the first time, open dialogue around topics that would have been previously regarded as taboo. Of course, there are things that are difficult for outsiders to accept. I have had to live through the sights and stories of little girls going through female genital cutting, which has led to hemorrhage and even death. And you feel outrage when seeing this. But with outrage alone, you can maybe save one girl, possibly a few girls. You need to understand fully and involve villagers to find a culturally relevant strategy that can reach a critical mass of people who can collectively make such practices disappear. And, this is not just about the abandonment of female genital cutting, for which Tostan is perhaps best known -- more than 6,500 communities in the countries where we work have publicly pledged to abandon this practice as well as child/forced marriage. This is about a different approach to development. It's about the social change that can happen when people get access to good information using engaging and participatory methods -- in their own language, designed for and with people who have never been to school, and that facilitates their potential to shape a more promising future for their families and community. Today, we run a three-year comprehensive nonformal education program in eight countries in Africa and in 22 national languages. Our Community Empowerment Program covers topics of immediate relevance to those in rural communities. We believe that to make any development initiative successful and sustainable, you need a foundation of education that should be delivered in a manner that is inclusive and leads to dialogue, ideas for taking action for change and positive outcomes. This inclusive process also embodies what we frequently talk about as ""empathy in development"" -- something I feel is often forgotten in the world of development. People are shocked by certain harmful practices they hear about in developing countries -- and with good intentions, they translate their outrage into telling people, ""This is wrong!"" or ""Stop this immediately!"" But we are talking about systemic change, and it goes deeper than just telling people what to do. Over the 22 years that we have been working as an organization, we have had many challenges and made many mistakes. Consequently, we have learned a great many things, and we are still learning. So much of what we do today is based on breakthroughs using knowledge we gained through thoughtful and lengthy discussions in classes or sitting under the neem trees or around a fire late into the night. We have learned four key elements that we continue to instill in all our programs. First, begin with human rights -- empower people to claim their rights to health and well-being with confidence. Two, start where people are -- have empathy and respect while you understand their history, their language and culture and their priorities. Three, do not try to force change -- lay the groundwork for dialogue, introduce people to ideas, identify shared values and allow them to decide what the change will be and when they will make it. If you start by just fighting what they are doing, you're going to get resistance. Finally, and perhaps most crucially, remember the solutions already exist within the communities with which you work. As my village father, El Hadji Moustaafa Njaay, a wise religious and traditional leader, once told me, ""Even if you know what the answer is, and you know what is right, you must let people discover it themselves."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Molly Melching.","Molly Melching says there were signs of inadequate health care when she moved to Senegal .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- John McCain is stuck in an ideological no-man's land. The Arizona senator is not sufficiently liberal for liberals. But nor is he conservative enough for conservatives. In an extraordinary gesture on Saturday, the Arizona Republican Party formally censured McCain, who is one of the most respected and powerful elected officials in the state. Those who adopted the resolution cited a legislative record that they say is insufficiently conservative on issues such as immigration reform and funding Obamacare. They also seem upset that McCain has worked with Democrats to pass legislation dealing with issues such as campaign finance reform. McCain has always been a hawk on national defense, and his pro-life credentials are solid. But, on other issues, he is a moderate -- at least by Arizona standards. Arizona GOP rebukes McCain for not being conservative enough . Former Sen. Jon Kyl, who represented Arizona in the Senate for three terms and whose own conservative credentials were rarely called into question by Republicans, stood by McCain. He told the Arizona Republic that McCain's record was ""very conservative,"" and he called the resolution ""wacky."" There's that word again -- or at least a variation of it. Do you remember when McCain got in a rhetoric shoving match with Senate rookie Ted Cruz of Texas? Last year, McCain called Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, ""wacko birds."" He later apologized. Partly, that's what this vote in Arizona is about. It's revenge of the wacko birds. During that tussle with the tea party faction of the Senate, many of the Republican faithful -- both in Arizona and around the country -- made it known that they preferred the confrontational approach on issues such as whether to fund Obamacare. McCain and other senators within the Republican establishment such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina were seen as much too accommodating. Obviously, there are plenty of Republicans with good memories. During their tussle, Cruz tweaked McCain by appearing to include him in what the tea party party favorite called the Senate's ""surrender caucus."" Cruz later denied using those words, but audio of Cruz's appearance on the Sean Hannity radio show proved otherwise. For McCain, whose record of military service is well-known, any talk of surrender is tantamount to fighting words. Perhaps. But I've seen McCain surrender before -- to right-wing Republicans in his home state when his political career seems jeopardized. That record is also fairly well-known and not nearly as commendable. I first met McCain in the late 1990s when I was a reporter and metro columnist for The Arizona Republic. I wrote some nice things about him and praised his ability to carve out an average of 60% of the Hispanic vote in his re-election campaigns. By the time McCain ran for president the first time, in 2000, I'd left the newspaper and returned to graduate school. I was a big fan of the ""maverick"" aboard the ""Straight Talk Express"" who, according to the marketing, had gotten crossways with stuffy Senate colleagues by putting solutions ahead of partisanship and working with Democrats. Twice during the campaign, I bumped into McCain, and he recognized me on sight. He would shake my hand enthusiastically. In 2008, when he ran again, I interviewed him and wrote a column laying out the case that he was a better choice for Latinos than Barack Obama. Then came the senator's radical makeover. In 2010, McCain found himself running for re-election against J.D. Hayworth, a former congressman turned right-wing radio talk show host. With polls showing that McCain was vulnerable to being turned out of office, the maverick became the conformist. He seemed determined to ""out crazy"" Hayworth on immigration, supporting the Arizona immigration law. That statute was opposed by 70% of Hispanics nationwide. I harshly criticized McCain for being so quick to throw Hispanics under the bus. I had hoped that someone who withstood five and a half years of torture in a North Vietnamese prison camp would have been stronger and able to resist those in his own party who tried to pull him to the nativist fringe -- and, by all appearances, succeeded in getting their way. The low point had to have been in June 2011, when McCain -- with no evidence to back it up -- blamed some Arizona wildfires on illegal immigrants. The real culprits turned out to be two campers who had been careless about putting out their campfire, and wound up being fined $3.7 million in damages. The senator wound up with huevos rancheros on his face. Now, as McCain decides whether to run again for re-election in 2016 -- when he'll be 80, and for what would be his sixth term in the Senate -- he seems to be drifting back to the middle. On immigration, he is signaling that he is ready to support the kind of comprehensive solution that he once championed. Perhaps in response to that, the crazies on the far right are -- through gestures like this resolution -- pulling again. Let's hope that, this time, he is stronger and better able to resist. It would be nice to have the maverick back for good. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette .","Arizona GOP censured John McCain for being insufficiently conservative .

"(CNN) -- Consider who comes to mind when we think of entrepreneurs. Does a day go by without mention of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg or Richard Branson in the media? While admirable, these men are not accessible, especially to women. Women are as likely as men to think entrepreneurship is a good career choice, that entrepreneurs have high status, and are represented positively in the media. So why do they admire this endeavor from afar, but think they are less equipped to do this? A study of women entrepreneurs released last December by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) found an estimated 187 million women starting and running businesses in 59 economies. That's a lot of women entrepreneurs -- about equal to the population of Brazil. Yet this pales in comparison to the number of men running businesses. In only one of the 59 economies (Ghana) were there more women than men entrepreneurs. Of the other 58, a handful had equal participation among the sexes, but the majority showed fewer women entrepreneurs than men -- with a ratio as low as 1:5 in South Korea, meaning there were five male entrepreneurs for every female entrepreneur. The biggest concern right now for policymakers centers on job creation. When people have jobs, society thrives, both economically and socially. Entrepreneurship plays a major role in job creation -- it is high-growth entrepreneurs who provide the majority of net new jobs in a society each year. We should be concerned when any group in society is excluded, even in part, from this activity, and when those participating tend to shy away from higher potential ventures. Films take on media portrayal of beauty . Why aren't there more women entrepreneurs? One explanation, revealed in the GEM study, centers on attitudes. Fewer women than men believe there are lots of opportunities for entrepreneurship and that they have the capabilities for this endeavor. Women are also more likely than men to be dissuaded by fear of failure. In wealthier countries, where entrepreneurs face more competition and markets are more sophisticated, the gap widens. It may stem from less awareness, training, or experience with entrepreneurship, but a seeming lack of confidence in one's capabilities and an aversion to failure is disconcerting. In addition, women are less likely to know an entrepreneur personally. Their inner circle of advisors is smaller, less diverse, and more often made up of family, spouses, in particular. What all this suggests is that women need more entrepreneurial role models, for one. This is happening in Brazil, Sweden and even Iran, where women entrepreneurs, even those in traditionally male-dominated fields are celebrated in the media and given recognition for their accomplishments. Dr. Rehana Kassim is the owner and founder of Rehanstat Sdn Bhd, which offers customized market research for an extensive list of public agencies and private companies. She is a role model in her home country of Malaysia. Yet her story, and those of other successful women entrepreneurs, are scarcely in the public eye. Top female chef's recipe for success . Other elements include training and guidance, as well as connecting women with other like-minded entrepreneurs to share experiences and provide support and advice. Programs like the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women project are providing women with training, networks, and the confidence to grow their businesses. In Ireland, the Going for Growth initiative holds roundtable discussions for women entrepreneurs, led by female mentors who have successfully grown their businesses. What remains a challenge, however, is infusing these positive attitudes across societies. Women entrepreneurs need people willing to invest in their businesses. They need families that support their ambitions, customers willing to buy from them, suppliers willing to work with them, and employees willing to work for them. When stakeholders such as these, and their societies as a whole, embrace their efforts, their economies can benefit from the ideas, the creativity, and the energy of half their population.","The number of women running businesses in the world is about equal to the population of Brazil .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya said Monday night it had taken control of a North Korean-flagged tanker that had docked in a rebel-controlled oil port, but rebels dismissed the government's claims. Culture Minister Habib al-Amin told reporters at a late-night news conference that government forces skirmished with rebels in speedboats as the ship left port Monday morning. The rebels were pushed back and government troops boarded the ship, which is loaded with what the United States said is ""illicitly obtained oil."" There was more shooting Monday night in connection with the disputed tanker but the ship was secure, al-Amin said. The rebels, meanwhile, told Libyan television that they still were in charge of the tanker and it was still docked at the port. Libyan 'force' goes after threatened oil tanker . The dispute is one snapshot in the bigger picture of who controls -- and who profits from -- Libyan oil sales. The vessel, dubbed Morning Glory, docked late Friday night in the port of As-Sidra in the northeastern part of the African nation. While the ship was flagged in North Korea, it is unclear who actually owns the vessel. Libya has seen its oil exports shrink to just 12.5% of its output since the revolution two years ago that led to the death of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. Since the revolution, the government in Tripoli has struggled for control of the North African nation. Tripoli had entrusted militia leader Ibrahim Jadran to safeguard some crucial oil ports. But eight months ago, he and his men seized them, blocked oil exports, and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region. Meet the man holding Libya's oil hostage . ""We used to be part of that government until the corruption became so visible, and the government started to sell oil without measuring units, and ... we became certain that such a government is not credible and unable to rebuild the state,"" Jadran, 32, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in January. ""That's why we declared independence of our province and we started to seek our fair rights."" There is a lot at stake, given the Libyan government's precarious state and the wealth of natural resources in the country. Libya is thought to have Africa's largest proven oil reserves. The country produced 1.6 million barrels per day after the revolution only to have that output slow to a relative trickle of fewer than 200,000 barrels per day by the end of last year. The government has said the disrupted oil production, from the seizures of ports as well as protests and strikes at other oil facilities, is costing the country $130 million a day. The oil at the center of the current As-Sidra port situation belongs to Libya's National Oil Corporation and its partners, which U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki notes includes U.S. companies. She said taking the oil amounted to theft from the Libyan people. ""Any oil sales without authorization from these parties places purchasers at risk of exposure to civil liability, penalties and other possible sanctions,"" Psaki said. Libya's government has threatened force against ships that entered the rebel-controlled oil ports before on several occasions. But despite ultimatums to such ships, those deadlines came and went with no action from Libyan officials. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reported from Libya and CNN's Steve Almasy reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","Government: Ship was sailing from port and we took it by force .

"(CNN) -- He's the king of cool but U.S. snowboard star Shaun White won't be reigning supreme over the daunting new slopestyle event at Sochi 2014. The double Olympic champion, who had been nursing a wrist injury, withdrew Wednesday just a day after admitting the course presented an ""intimidating"" challenge. Sochi organizers have faced fierce criticism over the layout at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, with competitors claiming that it is too dangerous to host the event -- which is making its Winter Games debut. And White's withdrawal will do little to deflect that criticism, even if the athlete stopped short of giving a specific reason for his decision. ""After much deliberation with my team, I have made the decision to focus solely on trying to bring home the third straight gold medal in halfpipe for Team USA,"" he said in a statement. ""The difficult decision to forgo slopestyle is not one I take lightly as I know how much effort everyone has put into holding the slopestyle event for the first time in Olympic history, a history I had planned on being part of."" Interactive: 10 to watch at Sochi . Two snowboarders have already suffered injuries while practicing on the course, which is made up of rails, quarterpipes and jumps. Norway's X-Games champion Torstein Horgmo -- widely considered a favorite for gold -- suffered a broken collarbone while Finnish snowboarder Marika Enne was carried away on a stretcher after hitting her head following a fall. ""It's intimidating,"" White told reporters when asked about the course Tuesday. ""You know any time you show up to a course you have to learn the speed, the distance from the jumps and what the rails are like. It's been a challenge. ""Any time you step out on a course there's a certain amount of danger, there's a certain element of risk you put yourself in for. ""Maybe this course might have a little bit more than others, but we're trying to figure it out. We're trying to get through the course, be safe and have a great Olympics.""","U.S. snowboard star Shaun White withdraws from slopestyle .

"(CNN) -- The United States calls them ""dangerous insurgents."" But Afghan authorities say they don't have enough evidence to keep the 65 prisoners behind bars. Abdul Shukor Dadras, head of the Afghan Review Board, said Afghanistan's attorney general ordered the prisoners' release from Bagram prison after a careful review of 88 cases. The U.S. military in Afghanistan condemned the move, expected to begin Thursday, arguing that the prisoners pose threats to security forces and civilians. ""Detainees from this group of 65 are directly linked to attacks killing or wounding 32 U.S. or coalition personnel and 23 Afghan security personnel or civilians,"" the military said in a statement. Releasing them, the military said, violates agreements between the United States and Afghanistan and is ""a major step backward for the rule of law in Afghanistan."" ""We have made clear our judgment that these individuals should be prosecuted under Afghan law. We requested that the cases be carefully reviewed,"" the U.S. military's statement said. ""But the evidence against them was never seriously considered, including by the attorney general, given the short time since the decision was made to transfer these cases to the Afghan legal system."" Abdul Basir Azizi, a spokesman for Afghanistan's attorney general, said the detainees' release was ordered after a review revealed that there wasn't enough evidence against them. The U.S. military's statement detailed evidence against several of the suspects, noting that the group included an alleged Taliban explosives expert, a suspected Haqqani network commander and a specialist accused of building and placing improvised explosive devices. It's not the first time Afghanistan's decision to release prisoners has upset the United States.

"(CNN) -- As so often happens in big international confrontations, Ukraine is devolving into a complicated mess from which no one has yet outlined a reasonable retreat acceptable to all sides. Russia did not push into Crimea just to put its tanks in reverse and go home. The Ukrainian government can't very well tolerate a land grab within 400 miles of Kiev. And the big Western powers, including the United States, have raised so many threats and objections, they will look weak, dishonest, or both if nothing is done now. So let's sort through some options as laid out by many of our expert analysts on CNN. 1) Going to the guns: This is a good one to dispense with first, because no one wants it. Ukraine, absent massive and sustained outside help, would be decimated by the Russian bear. The Russians are better trained, better equipped and better funded. By virtue of geography and their superior navy, they would start the fight with Ukraine 60% encircled by hostile forces. But Russia has reason to keep the pistols holstered, too. Turning eastern Ukraine into a battlefield would disrupt critical industry, agriculture, and oil and gas sales in the region for years. Also, a pitched battle could draw in other players, and then the whole World War III discussion lights up. 2) Russia retreats: Unlikely. They didn't steam into Crimea just for a getaway weekend. The Russians have important assets to protect there, and that does not necessarily mean the 60% of the Crimean population that grew up speaking Russian. The vaunted Black Sea Fleet counts on its Sevastopol port for year-round access (via Istanbul) to the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Arguably, the fear of losing that route to an unfriendly Ukrainian government is what drove Russia to take Crimea in the first place. Leaked call raises questions about who was behind sniper attacks in Ukraine . 3) Russia retreats with some conditions: More likely. What conditions? Crimean leaders have already voted to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia which was home until 1954, when Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine. Crimean voters will have a chance to ratify or reject this decision in the next couple of weeks, even as Kiev says they have no right to redraw the national borders. In any event, this is one possibility: Crimea becomes a part of Russia, or a semi-independent nation with great affection for Russia (read: a puppet state ready to do whatever Moscow wants). Or Russia gets a permanent agreement to turn Sevastopol into Russian territory, like the arrangement the United States has with Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. No matter how that plays out, Russia denies ever having designs on all of this -- even as the mysterious troops in the peninsula melt away, the rest of the world grumbles, and Ukraine goes back to trying to pay its debts. 4) Russia advances: Not content with Crimea and eager to show Kiev just who they are messing with, the Russians storm across the border and take much of eastern Ukraine. No one knows if this is in Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans, but if it happens ... see option No. 1. 5) The Western world turns on the squeeze play: The White House appears to want a unified effort in which nations all over the globe use their political and economic might to punish Russia and leave the new Ukrainian government triumphant. Problem is, several big countries seem reluctant to take that course, and unless everyone is on the same page, any sanctions would be weakened. And even though it was hit hard in 2008 by the recession, Russia is not Syria, Iran, or North Korea. This is a big nation that is unlikely to buckle quickly to any amount of pressure. U.S. intelligence under fire over Ukraine . The takeaway: There are plenty of other possibilities, but conventional wisdom says these are the most likely options at the moment. The biggest danger? Everyone is wrong ... and some unforeseen, uncontrolled options arise, making the situation not better, but even worse.

"(CNN) -- Only innovation can reduce illness and poverty in Africa, according to a program that is funding creative approaches to healthcare in developing countries. More than 50,000 women die each year of cervical cancer in Africa, according to World Health Organization estimates, as more than 80% of the cases are detected in late stages. In countries such as Tanzania, where nearly 4,500 women die annually from the disease, the problem is exacerbated by an acute shortage of medical experts and a lack of quality screening services, especially in rural areas. But now a group of Canadian and Tanzanian health innovators have joined forces to apply simple and safe mobile technologies to improve cervical cancer screening and thus potentially reduce mortality rates in the East African country. The idea is to send teams of two trained non-physician healthcare workers in remote Tanzania to examine women living several hours away from health centers. The nurses, who will be equipped with cervical screening and treatment tools as well as standard smartphones, will take a photograph of the cervix with their phone and send it via SMS to a medical expert in a specialized clinic. Trained doctors will then be able to review the image immediately and text the diagnosis back to the health worker, as well as give instructions about treatment. ""That's the beauty of it -- for early grade cancers, those will be able to be treated right in the field, right in the rural area,"" says Dr Karen Yeates, of Queen's University, Ontario, the principal investigator of The Kilimanjaro Cervical Screening Project. Read: How the cell phone can improve health care . The effectiveness of the idea will be put to the test in the coming months as Yeates was named Thursday amongst the 68 innovators to receive $100,000 Canadian grants to pursue bold concepts for tackling health issues in developing countries. In total, some $7 million has been awarded to 51 innovators in 18 low and middle-income countries, and to 17 Canadian projects, by Grand Challenges Canada, a group sponsoring breakthrough concepts to improve health in poor parts of the world. Thirty-eight of these projects will be implemented in Africa. ""This is probably the largest pipeline of innovation in global health from the developing world,"" says Peter Singer, chief executive of Grand Challenges Canada, which is funded by the Canadian government. ""It shows that poor countries are very rich in ideas because talent is everywhere, opportunity is not, and what we are trying to do is to bring opportunity to talent to improve health."" Amongst the Africa-based projects is a new trading system in Kenya where researchers will create a barcoded vaccination card that people can redeem for farm seeds and fertilizer as part of efforts to encourage vaccination of children. Benson Wamalwa, of the University of Nairobi, says the project ""would powerfully incentivize parents to seek and adhere to their children's immunization schedule even when hard pressed financially to reach a distant vaccination center. The idea is a practical solution that would significantly boost small farm productivity and incomes for poor households while safeguarding the general health of children in farming villages through up-to-date immunizations."" Read: How 'Afropreneurs' will shape Africa's future . Other programs include restoring native freshwater prawns in Senegal to eat the populations of snails that are responsible for the spreading of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis; paying youth in Uganda to collect and sort garbage and deliver it to a plant for conversion to fertilizer and biogas in order to improve sanitation; and anti-diarrhea kits for children hitching a ride on Coca-Cola's distribution chain to improve the availability of life-saving drugs. Grand Challenges Canada says it will repeat its Stars in Global Health program every six months, funding hundreds of projects over the coming years. It also plans to work with partners to provide scale-up funding of up to $1 million to those ideas that are proved to be successful so that they can have a bigger impact in a more sustainable way. Singer says that many of the traditional approaches when it comes to aid have proved to be inadequate. Instead, he argues, fostering innovation and investing in the ideas of the people can be an effective exit strategy from poverty. ""There are only two ways for a country to develop, there's only two sources of wealth in the world,"" he says. ""Either you mine the ground for resources and minerals, if you do that in a non-corrupt manner, or you mine the brains of your citizens for their bold ideas and help them to create social enterprises, to create businesses that can improve the local conditions in a broader scale."" He adds: ""I do think that these innovators can help the problems of their community -- in fact, they are the only thing that can.""","A Canada-backed body is sponsoring health innovators to pursue creative ideas .

"(CNN) -- While U.S. sports fans were coming to terms with the news that glamor girl Lindsey Vonn would miss the Winter Olympics, the woman who could again prove to be the nation's skiing sweetheart was relaxing on a beach. Vonn had been ruled out of a trip to Sochi by a serious knee injury, and things weren't going well for Julia Mancuso either. Frustrated by a difficult start to the World Cup season, the three-time Olympic medalist had escaped the cold to regroup at her Hawaii hideout. While her rivals were fine-tuning their technique on the slopes, she was bedecked in a bikini and plunging into the clear waters that surround Maui. ""It's definitely alternative but it's what I needed,"" Mancuso told CNN. ""It felt good. I'd had equipment issues and had been changing ski boots all the time. So for one I just decided to stick with one ski boot and that's the decision, that's great. ""Part of it, is that when things go wrong, you think of everything possible is wrong, like the boots or whatever. ""I went back home and sure I had some concerns. But I got my head round it."" The break helped -- since returning on January 11, Mancuso has managed her first three top-10 finishes of the season and been confirmed in the U.S. team for Sochi alongside 18-year-old sensation Mikaela Shiffrin, who is already a world champion in the slalom discipline. ""I'm ready, I'm in a good place and I still feel I can get medals in Sochi, multiple medals in my three events,"" Mancuso says, brimming with confidence. ""It just depends how the days go. What I've learned in my career is that anything is possible. In Sochi, it will just depend how the days go."" Mancuso, who won giant slalom gold in 2006 and two silvers in 2010, is used overcoming mixed performances in her Olympic buildups. Before Turin, she only hit form on the eve of the Games and triumphed despite knee pain, while come Vancouver she had not managed a top-three finish in a World Cup event for two years because of back problems. ""What I've done in the Olympics for sure gives me great confidence,"" she admits. ""But I don't plan on suddenly doing that just because I'm at an Olympics. ""I'm just trying the best I can in every race. I don't think there's any secret. Sometimes things don't go your way and sometimes they do."" Four years ago, she finished second in the downhill behind Vonn at Whistler -- but couldn't get within half a minute of her teammate's winning time despite making ""the run of my life."" Last March, she took third place at the world championships in the Super-G race where Vonn earlier crashed and tore her knee ligaments. They are both the same age -- 29 -- but Mancuso has been unable to match Vonn's incredible consistency on the World Cup circuit, which has brought her six overall titles and 59 race wins. ""I'd be lying if I said Lindsey not being there (at Sochi) doesn't help,"" Mancuso says. ""It's been so tough for her this year with her injury and not knowing whether she would compete. But as a competitor it's definitely one less rival for me. ""Look at Vancouver. I had the run of my life. I was a second quicker than the next girl and Lindsey was still better. So this is obviously a huge opportunity for me."" Without Vonn in her way in the downhill, life is certainly easier. The pair have had their ups and downs in the past but there has always been a mutual respect between them, and they had been training together until Vonn's latest setback. ""She can be so consistent and that's incredible,"" says Mancuso. ""Because of that, she's such a great athlete."" Despite Vonn's absence, Mancuso says she doesn't feel any added pressure to perform. ""I want to help inspire and I think the other American girls can do really well. We just need to be supportive,"" she says. ""The pressure is before getting to Sochi, making sure everything is aligned. When I get to Sochi, I'll relax. I'll have no fear as everything will work out how it's supposed to."" The Olympics have been dangled in front of her as long as she can remember, the signs still standing on the slopes at Squaw Valley where she learned to ski -- and which hosted the 1960 Winter Games. Her upbringing in the Lake Tahoe area was far from normal. At the age of five, her father Ciro was arrested and sentenced to nine years in prison for his part in a $140 million cannabis smuggling racket. He ended up serving two terms of 17 months and four years -- the latter starting in 1995 after he and Mancuso's mother Andrea had divorced. It is a moment she says ""helped me focus on skiing, it's all I wanted to do after that point."" Despite the disruption to her family life, she has managed to move on. ""I love to have fun in my life in whatever I do and whatever life brings, whether that's on the ski slopes or designing underwear,"" says Mancuso, who launched her own own lingerie line in 2010. ""I just want to have fun. I want to smile a lot and bring smiles."" Her dad will be there to watch her in Sochi, as he did in Turin. As will her younger sister Sara, a musician who also competes in the free-skiing big-mountain competitions -- she is likely to be in a neck brace after breaking two vertebrae in her back in a recent fall. Mancuso says she has ""no idea"" if Sochi will be her last Olympics -- for now she's just enjoying being back in the groove. ""I don't love it necessarily when I get to races, but then you get in the gate and I want to go faster,"" she says. ""It's fun again, it's all about how you feel. And I guess that's the adrenalin-junkie side of me. I still love it, but sometimes you have to fight to find that sweet spot. ""When it's easy, it's the easiest thing in the world as it feels right. But when you're struggling, you're searching for answers. ""I'm thankful for the success I've had over the years. It's been awesome.""","Julia Mancuso is hoping to fill the Winter Olympics void left by the injured Lindsey Vonn .

"(CNN) -- Europe's top football clubs will resume their battles for a place in the quarterfinals of the continent's biggest competition this month, with some still reeling after tie-changing moments of controversy. Last month's last-16 opening legs provided bitter lessons for two English teams hoping to make their mark against benchmark opponents, and prompted calls for changes to the game's rules. Spanish supremacy continued, though the signs are that Germany will likely have at least one finalist for the third year in a row. France may provide an outside threat to the status quo, thanks in part to a mercurial talent who will sadly not be displaying his maverick talents at this year's World Cup in Brazil. Here are the key talking points for the upcoming clashes: . Time for the sin-bin? When the draw was made for the Champions League last 16, two ties stood out for neutrals and fans alike. Manchester City's imperious form was vanquishing all-comers, and the prospect of the English club being pitted against a stuttering Barcelona was electrifying. Even the normally bullish Catalan press were concerned. Meanwhile, Arsenal's panache in England's Premier League suggested questions could be posed for the reigning European champion Bayern Munich. By the time the ties rolled around, Barcelona had found its feet again, while Arsenal had drifted somewhat off the boil. Nevertheless, the early exchanges in both games promised fascinating double-headers. Barcelona's immense skill was gradually being tempered by City's physicality, while Arsenal hinted that it might threaten Bayern's goal if it could just keep its composure. Then two big moments turned the ties on their heads. In Manchester, City defender Martin Demichelis' limitations were cruelly exposed by arguably the best player in the world, Lionel Messi; in London, Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny committed a clumsy but innocent-looking foul on Arjen Robben. The incidents led to the reviled ""triple punishment"" of a penalty, a red card, and less crucially for the games themselves, an automatic ban for both players. As contests, both matches -- and very probably the ties -- were effectively ended. Aside from the debate over whether Demichelis' foul was committed inside the penalty area, the letter of the law was followed in both cases. But as many have since argued, the games were ruined as a result, and certainly in Arsenal's case the punishment brutally outweighed the crime. On March 1, football's lawmakers, the International Football Association Board, met to debate the idea of a ""sin-bin"" -- something already employed effectively in rugby and ice hockey -- and ultimately rejected it. But it did sanction the continued experiment of sin-bins in recreational youth football. While controversial, and arguably open to abuse by cynical defenders, a sin-bin would offer referees an extra layer of discretion, and paying spectators a better chance of seeing 22 players complete a game. In the high-stakes environment of Champions League football it could be a welcome addition to the rule book. England's Premier League fluffs its lines on the big stage . With the exception of Manchester United, sent so forcefully back to the drawing board by Olympiakos that embattled manager David Moyes' head probably crashed through it, each of the English Premier League clubs could take a little solace from disappointing first-leg performances. City, having withstood an initial Barcelona barrage, seemed to be finding some rhythm before that red-card handicap came into play. Mesut Ozil may need counseling to banish the trauma of his first-half penalty miss, but at least Arsenal had started to threaten the visiting Bavarians. Chelsea also looked relatively comfortable before John Terry's absent-mindedness in the six-yard box let Galatasaray back into the tie. Nevertheless, like the curate's egg, these good-in-parts performances all left a sour tinge on the lips. Chelsea will rue not going for the jugular when the Turkish home side was reeling, while Jose Mourinho's striking options continue to -- rather publicly -- vex the Portuguese. His team should still go through, though, but this performance did not impress. While refereeing decisions may have helped Bayern and Barcelona coast to their respective 2-0 victories, their ability to retain the ball -- such an important skill at this level -- was at times startlingly superior. The idea of an unsophisticated English Premier League, lacking the tactical nous and basic skills to thrive at this level, may be less true than it once was, but City and Arsenal still have a way to go before they can match these hugely impressive opponents. Don't write off Barcelona and Real, but Bayern still favorite . With the Catalan giants beset by financial scandal and facing an unusually tough challenge on the home front, Barcelona's star looked to be on the wane in 2014. Likewise, it is not often that Real Madrid plays second fiddle to city rival Atletico, but this year there is a genuine threat to its hegemony from the Vicente Calderon. Both teams, however, look to be slipping back into their respective grooves. Barcelona warmed up for the first-leg clash with City by thrashing Rayo Vallecano 6-0, while back-to-back 3-0 wins over struggling Getafe and Elche showed Real's cool efficiency. Against City, Barca reminded the world of its precocious talent. Yes the red card ended the English side's chances of rising to the challenge, but Barcelona's metronomic passing and accurate finishing showed just how tough an opponent this team can be. It will be interesting to see how Tata Martino's team bounce back from Saturday's setback against Valladolid. Real, meanwhile, was irresistible in its 6-1 humiliation of Schalke in Germany, and leads the Spanish league after Sunday's win over Levante. If City's prospects for the second leg show only the barest twitches of life, Schalke's are not even worth a memorial service. But then we have Bayern. There is a sense that Pep Guardiola has, after only the barest hint of teething trouble, got this team playing exactly the way he wishes. Added to the muscular intensity of Bayern's previous incarnation are a fluidity and impudence that characterized the best performances of Guardiola's Barcelona side. It is very hard to see how the Germans could be improved. Embarrassingly unchallenged in the Bundesliga, there is little to suggest that ""Die Roten"" will not be sewing yet another Champions League star above the club badge in May. Two-speed Champions League makes things too predictable . The Champions League may be the pinnacle of club football, but survey the last-16 second-leg ties and it is difficult to suppress a feeling of disappointment. With very few exceptions, the quarterfinals look pretty much set. Just as the group stages generally went the way of the obvious, the tournament's big seeds are rolling into the next round with only minor distractions en route. Europe's top club competition remains controversial for the way in which it perpetuates the status quo. Without massive independent injections of cash from outside the game it is difficult to see this changing anytime soon. Arguably only Paris Saint-Germain has realistic hopes of breaking into the tight group of winners this year. It has to be a concern for UEFA, and the TV rights holders that may struggle to entice neutrals to their screens again before the quarterfinals. Whether anything can be done about it longer term, however, is another question. Zlatan is a genius . In a world in which sporting stars can sometimes be anodyne and uninspiring, Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic smashes the mold to smithereens. His swagger and apparent arrogance would be laughable if he did not so regularly back them up, but his continuing ability to underscore words with deeds is extraordinary. At PSG he is playing in a competition -- the French Ligue 1 -- that rarely stretches his talents and in a team that is built to serve him, so the best measure of his greatness is in the Champions League. Once again, he did not disappoint. Ibrahimovic's second goal against Bayer Leverkusen went viral before the final whistle had even sounded, and with good reason. The fact that he will not be playing in the 2014 World Cup is a huge loss to football.","The European Champions League resumes this week .

"New York (CNN) -- The Federal Railroad Administration issued an emergency order Friday requiring Metro-North railroad to take ""immediate steps to ensure its train crews do not exceed speed limitations"" in the wake of Sunday's deadly derailment in New York. The order -- a routine step after a major accident -- requires the railroad to ""modify its existing signal system to ensure speed limits are obeyed and to provide two qualified railroad employees to operate trains where major speed restrictions are in place until the signal system is updated."" All seven coaches and the locomotive came off the tracks in the Sunday morning crash on Metro-North Hudson line in the Bronx. In addition to the four dead, at least 67 people were hurt. The train jumped the tracks while barreling into a curve at 82 mph, nearly three times the 30-mph limit for the curve, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The engineer, William Rockefeller Jr., apparently ""was nodding off and caught himself too late"" before the accident, a union representative who met with the man has told CNN. Opinion: Is New York train derailment a criminal case? Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier, characterized what happened as ""highway hypnosis."" He said his client had had a full night's sleep before the crash, and that Rockefeller had no disciplinary record. According to NTSB representatives, results from alcohol breath tests for the train engineer were negative, and both the brake and signal systems appeared to be working. ""Safety is our highest priority, and we must do everything we can to learn from this tragic crash and help prevent future derailments,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement Friday. In a statement, Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the railroad, said the agency was ""working closely with the Federal Railroad Administration to review our policies and procedures in light of Sunday's tragic derailment."" ""We will of course comply with whatever requirements the FRA directs us to follow,"" she added. ""We are examining many other possible steps we can take to improve the safety of our railroad operations, and will continue making every effort to enhance customer and employee safety."" Feds: Metro-North train accidents 'unacceptable' The emergency order requires that Metro-North provide a list by Tuesday of main track locations where there is a reduction of more than 20 mph in the ""maximum authorized passenger train speed."" The railroad also is ordered to identify appropriate modifications to its existing ""automatic train control system or other signal systems to enable adequate advance warning of and adherence to such speed restrictions,"" the FRA statement said. ""These modifications will help prevent another over-the-speed-limit event if a locomotive engineer fails to take actions to appropriately slow or stop a passenger train,"" the agency said. Anders said the MTA's vice president of operations will lead the implementation of the new guidelines. The agency will work over the weekend to meet the first of the deadlines Tuesday. Metro-North, meanwhile, must operate trains with two qualified train crew members in the controlling locomotive cab or passenger car control compartment at the locations where speed limits change by 20 mph or more until the signal work is complete. Train crash victim was 'pure goodness,' widow says . In addition, the statement said, the railroad must submit an action plan ensuring safe operations for passengers and employees by Dec. 31, including target dates and milestones for implementing signal system modifications. Steven Ditmeyer, a former FRA official who teaches at Michigan State University, told CNN on Friday that the order are routine after major accidents. ""Having two people in the cab? I'd have to look at the control cab on one of these Metro-North commuter cars to see if two people can get in it,"" he said. ""On the locomotive, no question. But on the inbound runs with the control cab in the lead, this is going to be a little difficult to do."" The FRA said the order is mandatory and failure to comply would result in enforcement actions. The FRA had increased its oversight of Metro-North after a May 2013 crash, including additional inspections of its lines and audits of operations and compliance with federal regulations.

"(CNN) -- At least 50 people have been killed in flooding and landslides in Burundi, the central African country's government has said, as a storm swept away homes and cut off roads and power. The rains, which started Sunday night and caused flooding in northern areas around the capital of Bujumbura, also injured scores of people. ""These rains caused flooding, mudslides and landslides, destroying goods, houses and other infrastructure,"" the government said in a statement posted on its website. It said that it had identified about 50 bodies and that rescuers were searching for more victims. The government also said it would pay for hospital treatment for the injured and for burials of victims. Those who have lost their homes will be taken to a temporary site. Houses in the poorer parts of town are often made of mud bricks, which offer no resistance to torrents of water and mud.

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, President Putin of Russia faced an embarrassing foreign policy defeat. Assisted by Russia's ablest spin doctors, Putin's favored candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, had won Ukraine's presidential election, or at least had won the count. But thousands of protesters, alleging electoral fraud, surrounded government buildings, camping in the snow and waving orange flags. Eventually, Putin's Ukrainian allies capitulated. The Supreme Court called another round of voting, and voters dumped Yanukovych in favor of a politician, Viktor Yushchenko, who called for Ukraine's rapid admission to NATO. Putin was left spluttering. But he waited. In the winters of 2006 and 2009, gas supplies from the Russian company Gazprom were temporarily halted over payment disputes, but these were quickly resolved. Within a few years, self-destructive squabbling among Ukraine's new democratic leaders, as the economy stagnated, had discredited the ""Orange Revolution."" Putin found he could actually get along quite well with Yushchenko's main rival, Yulia Tymoshenko. Skip ahead ten years and Yanukovych, elected president in a reasonably free election in 2010, again finds himself facing angry crowds in Kiev's Independence Square, or ""Maidan."" This time the protesters demand he sign an association agreement with the EU that Putin has opposed. As before, Putin makes clear his disdain for the demonstrators and his support for Yanukovych. Yet, when his client is forced out of office, this time -- after violent street fighting between heavily armed Berkut riot police and protesters hurling stones and Molotov cocktails -- Putin does not sit on his hands. Over the course of a few days, Russian troops occupy the key points in Ukraine's predominantly Russian-speaking Crimean peninsula. The invasion sets off the most serious international crisis in Europe since the turn of the 21st century. Opinion: How Putin carries out power grab . Is Putin-2014 the same person as Putin-2004? Why in such ostensibly similar crises did he react in radically different ways? Why take an enormous gamble when he could be sure the current democratic victors in Kiev would self-destruct as quickly as the first crop? He would have to swallow a short-run setback. But Putin could then indulge his schadenfreude watching liberal prime minister Arseny Yatsenyuk tussle with nationalist leader Oleh Tyahnybok as Ukraine's economy melted down and the EU and IMF prepared a financial aid package sure to offer too little, too late, and only under stringent conditions. Within a few years, a more pro-Moscow administration was likely to emerge. By contrast, Russian troops in Crimea was the one thing certain to unite Kiev's factions, mobilize Ukraine's population and prompt rapid Western action on economic aid. At the same time, military intervention promised a string of unwelcome repercussions: Western sanctions, visa bans for members of the ruling elite, asset freezes, diplomatic embarrassments, even perhaps exclusion from the G8. For Russia, already facing a stagnant economy, such moves could only accelerate capital flight and scare international investors. Even more perverse, invasion would throw away in one day two years' worth of reputational capital, accumulated from a string of unexpected foreign policy successes. From isolation over Syria, Putin had managed to emerge as peacemaker in late 2013, persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to pledge to surrender his chemical weapons. By granting asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden, the Russian president could claim -- implausibly -- to be on the side of citizen privacy and transparency. Despite a chorus of gloom in the Western press, the Sochi Winter Olympics had passed without terrorist attacks or other disasters and with Russian athletes dominating the medals count. Is there a rational explanation for Putin's resort to arms in 2014? Western analysts have been at a loss. To those who have been raising the alarm about Putin's expansionist drive and wounded pride since before he came to office, there is nothing to explain: the dictator has shown his true colors. Yet this is hardly more informative than the stopped clock that is right twice a day. If Putin-2014 was a militant expansionist, why did Putin-2004 hold back? What to make, then, of Putin-2000 who, when asked whether Russia might one day join NATO replied: ""Why not? I do not rule out such a possibility."" Later there was Putin-2002 who said that the Baltic states joining NATO was ""no tragedy."" Over the years, Putin acquiesced to U.S. bases in Central Asia after 9/11, shared intelligence with Washington, agreed to cut nuclear arsenals by two thirds, and defied his own Communist protesters to establish a route through Russia for U.S. military supplies to Afghanistan. So what has changed? Most plausibly, Putin hopes to use the conflict to ignite nationalist pride and anger at home, building a new base of anti-Western support for his leadership as he loses the backing based on economic performance. (With oil prices no longer rising, and global liquidity tighter since the 2008 financial crisis, Russia's growth slowed to just 1.3 percent last year.) If so, this is unlikely to work. In a poll one month ago, 73 percent of Russians opposed intervention in Ukraine's politics. Comparable nationalist rallying points in the past such as Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia produced a spike in Putin's ratings, but one that had completely reversed within a few months. The costs of the Crimean intervention, in reduced investment and international isolation, will last longer than the immediate rally behind the flag. So will the heightened tensions with other neighboring states that contain large Russian-speaking minorities, such as Kazakhstan and the NATO-members Estonia and Latvia. Opinion: Putin's endgame and why the West may have a hard time stopping him . That after 14 years the leader of an increasingly authoritarian state should start to make mistakes is not surprising. Such leaders tend to become trapped in an information bubble of their own creation. Surrounding themselves with friends and colleagues with similar world views, they --deliberately or unwittingly -- cut themselves off from unwelcome information. They forget that the media they have censored tells them only what they want to hear, and that the ""experts"" they have cultivated are those that reinforce their own prejudices. They start to believe the verdicts of the courts they have politicized. Like all people but more so, they succumb to attribution bias -- believing the worst of others and the best of themselves -- and to the overconfidence effect -- the tendency to exaggerate the odds of success. The result is a distorted view of events that is self-serving and black and white. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who spoke to Putin by phone last Sunday, said that he seemed to be ""in another world."" The result can be decisions that put the leader's own position at risk. Gen. Augusto Pinochet, after ruling Chile for 15 years, came to believe he was extremely popular. To his dismay, a plebiscite he called in 1988 revealed that most Chileans would rather have a different leader. Other authoritarian leaders, such as Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, have lost power after calling elections that they were sure they would win. Although his regime faces no immediate danger, and the first polls may well show initial support for his moves, Putin has made his task of holding onto power in the medium run more difficult. Business elites, both in and outside his circle, will resent the new instability and isolation the Crimean operation has created. The Russian stock market fell almost 13% on the first day after the invasion, and the Central Bank had to raise interest rates to stanch decline in the ruble. Support for any intervention with economic and human costs is likely to drain away fast. Yet, the information filter around Putin will make it hard for him to evaluate what is going on. Rather than recognizing his own mistakes, he will tend to believe stories of betrayal and external hostility. Unless the dissonance rises to such a level that it provokes a major rethink -- and he proves flexible enough to question his own action -- he is likely to continue miscalculating as the crisis unfolds. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Treisman.","Ten years ago, Vladimir Putin tolerated a Ukraine uprising, ultimately seeing things go his way .

"Washington (CNN) -- To Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine because the United States failed to avenge the 2012 terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. ""It started with Benghazi,"" Graham posted Tuesday on Twitter. ""When you kill Americans and nobody pays a price, you invite this type of aggression."" Nonsense, said Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Paul Begala. ""The whole notion that this is all about the United States or all about President Obama, it's frankly silly,"" Begala said Wednesday on CNN's ""New Day."" Such is the state of political discourse these days in the United States, where every issue -- particularly one that dominates media headlines -- becomes fair game for partisan attack. Election year rhetoric . The dynamic is especially acute in an election year, when candidates and parties seek to score points with voters, and magnified even more when it involves foreign policy, noted Darrell West, the vice president for governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ""It doesn't matter what happens -- Republicans attack and Democrats sound defensive,"" West told CNN on Wednesday. ""It's easy to do in foreign policy because there are so many unexpected things that take place. Every month there's going to be a crisis. We just don't know where."" House committee resolution urges sanctions against Russia . Regardless of what started the events that led to Russia's incursion into Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula last week, both sides have adopted postures now familiar to Americans already disgusted with the political dysfunction permeating Washington. ""Can you think of any place in the world, any place where we are better off now than we were when he came to office?"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday of President Barack Obama. ""He has acted in such a way almost amounting to passivity in many instances."" Concerned about being labeled a war-monger, McConnell quickly made clear that ""we are not suggesting here that the use of force is appropriate in very many occasions."" ""Only occasionally,"" he said. ""But there is a widespread kind of lack of respect for U.S. opinion."" Partisan divide . To former Vermont Gov. and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean, Obama ""is doing exactly the right thing"" with a measured approach to the Ukraine crisis. ""He's ratcheting up the heat, and he's doing it slowly enough so that Putin has a chance to back off,"" Dean said Tuesday on CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""One problem with Vladimir Putin is not only has he broken the law, but he now has to back down and save face at the same time. He needs the opportunity to do that. So the President needs to tighten the vise, keep squeezing gently, carefully, and not making it so public. And I think he's doing exactly that,"" Dean said. Does Putin want a new Cold War? Most striking about the back-and-forth is that deep down, the two sides generally agree on what should happen. No one wants a military confrontation involving U.S. forces, instead preferring steps to isolate Russia diplomatically and economically. Ideas include a threatened boycott of the upcoming G8 summit in Sochi, with hints of kicking Russia out of the group of industrial powers that includes the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada. Also under consideration are strong economic sanctions, perhaps targeting Russia's state-owned banks or wealthy oligarchs who keep and spend much of their money abroad. The United States has halted some military cooperation as well. Tough races mean tough attacks . The venom of political dialogue generally depends on the toughness of the electoral challenge facing a particular candidate. Graham and McConnell both have conservative primary rivals in traditionally red states of South Carolina and Kentucky, and therefore want to sound belligerent against anything involving Obama and Democrats. Compare their rhetoric to Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the GOP vice-presidential nominee in 2012 who remains open to a presidential run in 2016. With his re-election presumably as safe as can be, Ryan touched on the main points of responses from both sides to the Ukraine crisis. Ryan: White House invited aggression but taking right steps . ""When you have the world superpower having a foreign policy that, in my opinion, is weak and a defense policy now that shows weakness, I think it invites aggression. I think that it creates a vacuum that is filled by these types of actions,"" Ryan told CNN on Wednesday. ""But, let's be really clear. Who is to blame for this? Vladimir Putin is to blame for this. And, I think the administration is making the proper responses."" Republican group ties Clinton to Obama handling on Ukraine . To West, Republicans ""always love to make Obama look weak on foreign policy."" ""It's easy to say that the President was caught off guard,"" West said in a telephone interview. ""He was caught off guard, but so was every expert in the country. I don't think anybody anticipated that first there would be the overturning of the government in the Ukraine, and then the Russian response after that."" He called the knee-jerk criticism ""a way for people to take advantage of the international uncertainty to score political points,"" adding that ""political responses are heightened because we're facing a midterm election."" Hawks oppose defense cuts . Graham clearly had the 2016 presidential vote in mind when he linked Benghazi to Ukraine. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming Democratic favorite if she runs, and Graham and other Republicans want to keep the terror attack in Libya on her watch fresh in the minds of voters. West, did you really expect Russia to ignore Ukraine chaos? He also is among a group of hawkish Senate veterans trying to minimize or even reverse cuts to defense spending in recent years, hastened in part by GOP insistence on reduced government spending. ""A lot of the current discussion is taking place against the backdrop of a conflict over defense spending,"" West noted. ""Obama's budget wants to scale back defense spending, and Republicans are upset with that. It's easy for them to use Ukraine as an example for not cutting the military."" U.S. strategy for Ukraine crisis: Money talks . Clinton compares Putin's Ukraine moves to Hitler, later recalibrates . Putin vs. Obama: Facing off over facts in Ukraine .

"ZURICH, Switzerland -- FIFA hierarchy have voted to scrap the policy of rotating World Cup finals between the six continental confederations, following a meeting in Switzerland. Vice-president Chung said the rotation would be dropped from 2018. Executive committee vice-president Chung Mong-joon announced in Zurich on Monday that by a unanimous vote it had been decided to drop the rotation from 2018. Chung explained that all associations would be free to apply to host future World Cup finals, providing they did not belong to confederations that had staged either of the two previous tournaments. South Africa is set to host the 2010 event, and Brazil is expected to have its bid for 2014 confirmed on Tuesday. FIFA has been under heavy pressure to open the 2018 bidding to allow nations outside North and Central America and the Caribbean to host the tournament. The rotation system meant that after Colombia dropped out of the 2014 race, Brazil was left as the sole candidate -- a situation FIFA president Sepp Blatter wanted to avoid in the future. Blatter said the executive committee rejected a proposal from CONCACAF to restrict the competition to the North America region for the 2018 tournament and then open it up. ""FIFA's decision does not change our own commitment to try to bring the World Cup back to the United States,"" U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati said. ""I believe that a U.S. bid will be very competitive."" South Korea and Japan shared the 2002 World Cup and Germany was the host in 2006. ""If you go back to 2002, and look at the recent history of rotation ... it's been Asia, Europe, Africa and with 2014 going to South America,"" CONCACAF general secretary Chuck Blazer told The Associated Press. ""I thought in all logic and fairness the next cycle should be CONCACAF. Regrettably, that did not carry the day . Blatter indicated there is widespread interest in hosting the 2018 World Cup. ""Already we have a bunch of big, great candidates,"" he said. Other nations interested in hosting the 2018 event include England, Russia, Australia, Spain, China, Mexico and a joint bid from the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. ""I am delighted that FIFA have opened the door for the World Cup to come back to England,"" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Monday in a statement. ""By 2018, it will be 52 years since England hosted the World Cup. The nation which gave football to the world deserves to have the greatest tournament back on these shores."" England's FIFA vice-president Geoff Thompson said: ""We welcome the decision made by the FIFA executive committee and will now consider our position."" The English FA will discuss the matter at Wednesday's board meeting. Blatter said the FIFA executive committee would decide on the 2018 hosts in 2011 and that bids would have to be submitted at least two years in advance. ""I think they should start their bidding campaign tomorrow!"" he quipped. The FIFA supremo confirmed that Sebastian Coe, chairman of FIFA's ethics committee, would play a key role in the 2018 bidding process. ""We try to be fair and transparent and we have had a discussion on this matter with the chairman of our ethics committee and we have invited him and his committee to overlook the bid process,"" said Blatter. ""This will be not only looking at the FIFA executive committee -- you should also have a look at the bidders and he will do that."" If there are a large number of candidates for 2018 -- Blatter mentioned 10 or 11 countries -- then FIFA will adopt the Olympic policy of making a 'pre-selection' to reduce the bidders. FIFA, meanwhile, have announced new rules to clamp down on third-party ownership of players following the Carlos Tevez controversy involving West Ham. The new FIFA regulation states: ""No club shall enter into a contract which enables any other party to that contract, or any third party to acquire the ability to influence in employment and transfer-related matters its independence, its policies or the performance of its teams. ""The FIFA disciplinary committee may impose disciplinary measures on clubs that do not observe the obligations set out in this article."" Tevez joined West Ham from Brazilian side Corinthians, who have since become embroiled in an investigation by Brazilian police. FIFA president Sepp Blatter said: ""Identification of ownership of this club and the transfer of money going from there to England is a matter which has already been dealt with partially. ""We have been presented with a new approach about how to try to solve this problem and it will be ratified to come into force at the end of the year.""

"(CNN) -- After Massachusetts teen Philip Chism pleaded not guilty to rape, lawyers on Thursday discussed whether he should be treated as a juvenile on that count or as an adult, as is the case for the murder charge he's facing in his teacher's death. Dressed in a dark sweater over a tie and button-down shirt, the 15-year-old Chism looked ahead but did not speak during Thursday's hearing in Salem. After his lawyer waived a reading of the new charge, a not guilty plea was presented on his behalf on an additional rape charge on which he was indicted last Friday. Kate MacDougall, a Essex County District Attorney's office prosecutor, did not ask for bail on the new charge, given that Chism already is being held. That indictment came down three months after, authorities say, Chism killed Colleen Ritzer, 24, his math teacher at Danvers High School. Police say Chism used a box cutter he'd taken to school to kill Ritzer on October 22 in a girls' bathroom at the school. He pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape and robbery, as well as for murder -- for which he's set to be tried as an adult -- in December. The additional count of aggravated rape came in the form of a youthful offender indictment. The difference between or circumstances surrounding the two different rape charges was not immediately clear. The prosecutor, defense attorneys and Judge Howard Whitehead talked about whether Chism should be treated as a juvenile on this new charge or as an adult. ""It's an open issue,"" said Whitehead, later asking both sides to submit their views to him in writing by March 1. In addition to this discussion, MacDougall noted that a ""substantial"" amount of new material related to the investigation was being provided to the defense. Among other things, this included extensive surveillance imagery tied to that tumultuous fall day in Massachusetts' North Shore. The judge set the next court date for the afternoon of April 7, noting that a pretrial hearing on the case should take place ""sometime in late May or early June.""","Philip Chism has a not guilty plea entered on his behalf on the additional rape charge .

"(CNN) -- Ukraine has been wracked with ceaseless demonstrations for weeks as protesters demand constitutional reform and a closer relationship with Europe instead of Russia. A breakthrough finally came Tuesday: Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his government resigned, and the national parliament voted overwhelmingly to repeal sweeping anti-protest laws passed earlier this month. Still, activists say that while they're pleased by these developments, their fundamental concerns have yet to be addressed. Amid the protests are accounts of police brutality and government intimidation. The desire for a government shake-up was spurred by the government's decision in November to forgo a planned trade deal with the European Union, which many interpreted as a turn away from Europe and toward Russia instead. CNN iReport had the opportunity to speak to a native Ukrainian who has spent days on the streets of central Kiev, the power base of the opposition. The 31-year-old, who works as a project manager, has been photographing and standing alongside those who are protesting. He shared his thoughts and photos to provide a firsthand view of the demonstrations and the motivations behind them. Freddy UA asked to be identified with an alias for his protection because of the current state of his country. The interview below has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN: When did you first get interested in the protesting? UA: The Ukrainian people started protesting in November, after the authorities announced they were not ready to sign an agreement with the European Union. A lot of people, including me, were disappointed by this action. CNN: Why are people continuing to protest in Ukraine? UA: After the violent crackdowns by police on peaceful demonstrations of students, the protests got another vector. People were scared of the bloody actions taken by the government. I saw thousands of peaceful protesters sing songs, dance, and recite poetry (while) ... under threat of violence by the police. The atmosphere was great at first, but after a while, a nightmare began. Ukraine government resigns, scraps anti-protest legislation . CNN: How would you describe the state of Kiev over the past few days? UA: On January 26, the atmosphere in Kiev was calmer than in previous days. At Independence Square everything is well. People are singing the national anthem every hour, listening to opposition politicians, celebrities, and famous figures who are speaking from the scene. CNN: Can you describe who the average Ukrainian protester is? UA: The average protester is mostly middle-aged people with an active civil position. They are taking part in the protesting because they resent the arbitrariness of the authorities. CNN: Where else is protesting happening in Ukraine? UA: The protests are going on not only in Kiev, but also in other cities -- mostly regional ones. People organize peaceful meetings, which the government is trying to disperse. But as far as I can tell, these actions don't disrupt the life and work in these cities in general. CNN: What do protesters want the Ukrainian government to know? UA: First of all, we hope that government will find the courage to recognize their illegal actions; such as the use of force on peaceful protesters and will stop the violence from their side, will release all of protesters arrested earlier, and sit at the negotiations table with the opposition. Ukraine opposition rejects president's offer . CNN: What are your thoughts on a possible truce between protesters and the government? UA: I think that a truce will help the situation of course because we don't want to see the blood and death on our streets! I can't predict what will happen next, but I hope that government will finally stop the violence against civilians, will listen to its people, the world, and the European community and will start a constructive dialogue. CNN: How long will people continue to protest? UA: Given what I hear from the protesters, they are willing to stay till the end and till the victory of democracy. Cold weather certainly has an impact on the protesters, but volunteers and citizens of Kiev bring them hot food and drinks like tea and coffee -- but not the alcohol. CNN: What do you want the world to know about the situation in Ukraine? UA: I want people around the world to know about the situation in our country and support Ukrainians in the fight for freedom and democracy. We all want to live in a lawful state with an honest government and police that protects its people.","Ukrainian native Freddy UA has been documenting the protests in Kiev .

"(CNET) -- Meeting the Obama Administration's goal of putting 1 million plug-in electric vehicles on the road by 2015 will only happen with a coordinated set of policies and technology advances, according to an electric vehicle association. Chevrolet hopes the Volt will be the first mass-produced plug-in electric car on American roads by late 2010. The Electric Drive Transportation Association (EDTA) on Tuesday is expected to release a set of policy recommendations for ushering in what auto industry executives call a major technological shift away from gas-only cars to electrics. EDTA members include auto manufacturers, battery companies, a number of electric utilities, and other industry associations. The group is lobbying for policies to boost domestic manufacturing industry, fund technology research, and launch wide-scale testing of electric vehicles. It said tax incentives, which currently give consumers up to a $7,500 rebate depending on battery size, should be extended to a higher number of cars and private fleet purchases. On the technology side, batteries remain the biggest hurdle. The EDTA said the Department of Energy should fund to develop and test energy storage and fuel cells systems. ""Energy storage capability is the key to the success of the vehicles and also is the enabling technology for using renewable power as a transportation fuel,"" according to the EDTA's policy recommendation report. In an indication how of important battery technology is, General Motors decided to manufacture the battery pack for the Chevy Volt and other electric-gas cars itself, rather than purchase the packs from a supplier. The battery cells will be supplied by LG Chem. In addition to technology progress, battery and auto company executives say that establishing a supply chain of electric vehicle components will require collaboration among different companies. Fourteen U.S. companies have established an alliance to lobby the U.S. government for $1 billion in federal aid to build up U.S. battery manufacturing, according to a Wall Street Journal report published last December. Car manufacturers will need to provide warranties on batteries which have not yet had years of testing among consumers, the EDTA said. Some automakers have considered leasing batteries, which will allow consumers to upgrade to newer batteries. The EDTA also argues that new business models are required to prompt consumers to purchase electric vehicles, even though they promise a jump in fuel efficiency. The group recommends setting up an infrastructure for charging stations, coordinating with utilities and companies that test fleets of plug-in electric vehicles, including government agencies. ""By helping public and private entities to build coherent alternative vehicle and infrastructure solutions, the federal government can help the industry to move beyond the 'chicken vs. egg' question,"" according to the report. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc.

"(CNN) -- That Africans today so dominate distance running is in part testament to the career of Kipchoge (Kip) Keino. Keino claimed an unexpected victory in the 3,000m steeplechase in Munich in 1972. The first black African to break onto the international stage at the beginning of the 1960s, Kip Keino won two Olympic golds and was a formidable force in the sport for 12 years. Other athletes would win more golds, but few would win races and hold records at all distances from 1,500 meters to 10,000 meters. Keino was 24-years-old before he competed at his first Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964 where he finished 10th and fifth in the 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters respectively. In 1965 he broke two world records: the 3,000m at Helsingborg in Sweden in seven minutes 39.6 seconds (his first attempt at the distance); and the 5,000m in Auckland in 13 minutes 24.2 seconds. His form looked good for the high-altitude games of Mexico City in 1968, but stomach cramps forced him out of the 10,000m with just two laps to go. He recovered to win a stunning gold in the 1,500m. Knowing that race favorite, Jim Ryun had a devastating kick in the final hundreds, Keino decided to hit the front early. He managed to hold on and finished 20 meters ahead of Ryan -- the largest winning margin and the second fastest time in the event's history. Born to run . In the same year he also took a silver in the 5,000m. He had run six races in just eight days despite a gallbladder infection. But it was at the Munich Games of 1972 that the untrained Nandi tribesman from Kipsano, in the high plains of Kenya, proved he was born to run. In the steeplechase, with only one win from his previous four competitive attempts at the event and twenty-three others lining up with better personal times, Keino was not even expected to make the final. Yet, somehow he staved off challenges from his more experienced compatriot, Ben Jipcho, and Finland's Tapio Kantanen, to win in an Olympic record time of eight minutes 23.6 seconds. Keino will be remembered for two things: opening up the latent athletic talent of Africa and his disquieting natural ability to conquer all-comers in five distinct events. When he finally retired after the All Africa Games in Lagos in 1975, he fittingly returned home to a daughter he and his wife had named Milka Olympia Chelagat.","Olympic record: 2 gold medals and 2 silver medals .

"(CNN) -- A decade ago, over 1 million people in Zambia were living with HIV. Only 143 of them were receiving treatment. The average cost of that treatment was more than $10,000 per year. Being infected with HIV in Zambia was akin to a death sentence. When I visited Zambia in 2012, the picture had changed. Eighty percent of Zambians living with HIV now had access to treatment. I met Florence Daka, a mother of four, who received anti-retroviral treatment five years ago to prevent her from passing the virus to her baby while she was pregnant. Florence now takes medicine that allows her to work full time and care for her children. It costs about 50 cents per day. View full gallery: Zambia, then and now . On World AIDS Day, December 1, we have an opportunity to make Florence's story a reality for more families by supporting an organization that is helping developing countries respond to three of the world's biggest health challenges -- the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Since it was founded in 2002, the Global Fund has been a leader in the world's successful response to HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. All told, its efforts have saved nearly 9 million lives. Opinion: Wrong time to reverse course on HIV/AIDS . The Global Fund also plays a key role in helping developing countries change the course of these three epidemics. For example, when people have early access to HIV testing and treatment, they not only save their own lives but they dramatically reduce their chances of infecting others. Moreover, a simple preventive procedure like voluntary medical male circumcision lowers a man's chance of acquiring HIV -- and potentially transmitting it to his partner -- by about 60%. Overall, effective prevention and treatment programs have helped reduce new HIV infections by a third since 2001. That last number is crucial, because preventing new HIV infections is absolutely essential to ending AIDS. Developing a vaccine to prevent HIV remains critical, and scientific researchers are achieving exciting breakthroughs. In the meantime, we need to develop new technologies that women can use to protect themselves. Condoms are a great way to prevent the spread of HIV, but they require the cooperation of both partners. Interactive: World AIDS Day . Even if a vaccine or a revolutionary new prevention method were discovered tomorrow, our work wouldn't be over -- because they won't end AIDS if they don't reach people at risk. That is what the Global Fund has been so successful at doing for the past decade: delivering the best tools available to the people who need them most. The Global Fund doesn't just provide money for pills and other health products. It channels its resources into training new generations of doctors, nurses, and health care workers. It helps developing countries build stronger health systems.

Put simply: The Global Fund isn't just one of the kindest things people have ever done for each other -- it's also one of the smartest investments the world has ever made. On Monday and Tuesday, leaders from around the world will meet in Washington for the Global Fund's fourth pledge conference, called the Global Fund Replenishment, to raise the necessary funding for the next three years. 'No longer a death sentence' The gathering is a reminder that the Global Fund was founded by the world to address an urgent need.

"Berkeley, California (CNN) -- On a research trip in Nigeria, Dr. Laura Stachel watched as physicians performed an emergency cesarean section. What happened next stunned her. ""The lights went out,"" Stachel recalled, ""and I said, 'How are they going to finish?' "" She was even more surprised by the nonchalant response. ""You didn't even see people reacting because it was something they were so used to,"" she said. Fortunately, Stachel had a flashlight with her, and the doctors were able to use it to complete the surgery. But during that two-week trip in 2008, she witnessed countless other times when the lives of mothers and babies were at risk simply because of a lack of reliable electricity. Pregnant women would arrive at the hospital with severe complications, but without adequate light to treat them, procedures had to be compromised or delayed until daylight. Some women were even turned away. ""I realized that my skills as an obstetrician-gynecologist were utterly useless (without) something as basic as light and electricity,"" Stachel said. Stachel said midwives in Nigeria use all kinds of makeshift lighting when they deliver babies: kerosene lanterns, candles, even cell phones. ""That's not adequate light for maternity care,"" she said. ""If somebody is hemorrhaging, if a baby needs resuscitation, you need to have directed light."" Nigeria is one of the 10 most dangerous countries in the world for a woman to give birth. In 2010, an estimated 40,000 Nigerian women died in childbirth -- 14% of all such deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization and the United Nations. Meanwhile, the neonatal mortality rate is also one of the worst in the world. Each year, about 4% of babies in Nigeria die before reaching 28 days old; for comparison, the United States rate is only a fraction of this at 0.4%. Stachel said that in her two weeks in Nigeria, she saw more complications than she had in her entire career in the United States. ""Once I witnessed the things that I saw,"" she said, ""I had to let people know, and I had do something about it."" With the help of Hal Aronson, her husband and a solar energy educator, Stachel worked to find a solution. He drew up designs for a solar electric system to provide a free source of power to the state hospital in northern Nigeria where Stachel had conducted her research. While they raised funds for the project, Stachel returned to Nigeria with a small kit to help show what the system would be able to do: It had a couple of solar panels inside, some lights and walkie-talkies to improve communication. The kit was only meant for demonstration purposes -- a miniature model of the larger system. But the surgical technicians saw it as something else. ""They said: ""This is incredible. You have to leave this with us. ... This could help us save lives right now,' "" Stachel said. She did just that, and news of the kit soon spread to other clinics. So each time Stachel would return to Africa, she came with one or two new ""solar suitcases"" assembled by her husband. Today, the solar suitcase includes two solar panels that are mounted on a clinic's roof and connected to high-quality LED lights. Once fully charged, it can provide light for up to 20 hours. The kit also contains headlamps, a fetal Doppler to monitor a baby's heart rate and a cell phone charging unit. Over time, the solar suitcase has become simpler in design. ""We got to something that was really rugged, simple to use, portable and that we knew would really work in harsh environments,"" Stachel said. It also spread to other countries after Stachel and Aronson started a nonprofit, We Care Solar. Since 2009, the kits have been helping health-care workers save lives not only in Nigeria but in facilities throughout Africa, Asia and Central America. For Stachel, the solar suitcase is only part of a bigger mission to improve maternal health care and lower mortality rates in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization, about 800 women die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. And 99% of all maternal deaths occur in developing countries. ""I really want a world where women can deliver safely and with dignity, and women don't have to fear an event that we consider a joy in this country. To see birth associated with death and fear is an outrage,"" Stachel said. ""Before I went to Africa, I knew women were dying at high rates. I just didn't know they were run-of-the-mill things we can take care of."" In 2009, We Care Solar completed the solar electric installation that her husband originally designed for the state hospital. Over the next year, the hospital reported that the death rate for women had decreased 70%. Nurses told Stachel they could see what they were doing, they didn't have to turn women away, and they had blood for transfusions because the electricity provided power for a blood bank refrigerator. ""When we saw the impact, that gave me the impetus to provide this fundamental thing for people to do the job they knew how to do,"" Stachel said. We Care Solar provides its solar suitcase, along with training and installation, to hospitals and clinics for free. Each solar suitcase costs $1,500, which the nonprofit funds through grants and support from partner organizations and sponsors. Stachel also works with its partners in various countries to identify clinics in need and help engage the community. ""We often ask them to be involved participating in research studies, giving us feedback and making a commitment to maintain these and to replace parts as they're needed,"" Stachel said. So far, We Care Solar has provided nearly 400 solar suitcases to facilities in 27 countries. They're being used in main hospitals as backup systems and in rural clinics as a primary source of electricity. ""It's just shifted the morale of the health-care worker,"" Stachel said. ""They're now excited to come to work. ... Mothers are now eager to come to the clinics."" Fanny Chathyoka, a midwife at a rural clinic in landlocked Malawi in southern Africa, used to use light from her cell phone when treating patients at night. She said the solar electric kit she received from Stachel last month ""keeps me going."" ""This light ... is going to bring good changes,"" she said. ""We should not lose any women. I will be able to give good deliveries. Suturing will not be a problem for me. Resuscitation of a baby during the night will not be a problem, because of the light. I feel very happy."" Ultimately, Stachel hopes her efforts will be part of a movement that makes a dent in a very big problem. ""We didn't set out to transform maternal health care around the world, but it feels like this has grown to something so much bigger than I had ever imagined,"" she said. ""Communities are celebrating the fact that they have light. And that they now have one more component to help with safe motherhood. It's amazing."" Want to get involved?

"Melbourne, Australia (CNN) -- A grand slam finale that wasn't supposed to be dramatic turned out to be one of the most memorable in recent history. Here Stanislas Wawrinka was, in his first major final at the Australian Open, facing world No. 1 Rafael Nadal -- who he had never even taken a set off in 12 previous matches. Nadal looked sharp in disposing of Roger Federer in the semifinals and not many thought he wouldn't complete the deal against the 17-time grand slam winner's fellow Swiss, even if Wawrinka upset three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. But not for the first time in Melbourne, an injury to Nadal early in an encounter hampered the Spaniard and Wawrinka opened his grand slam account with a stunning 6-3 6-2 3-6 6-3 victory. ""Bad luck was against me today but you really deserved it so congratulations,"" Nadal, wiping away tears, told the crowd post match in a scene reminiscent of Federer's runner-up speech in 2009. ""Sorry to finish this way. I tried very, very hard."" But there was elation for Wawrinka. ""It's quite crazy what's happening right now,"" the 28-year-old told reporters later. ""I never expected to win a grand slam. I never dreamed about that because for me, I was not good enough to beat those guys."" Read more: Wawrinka stuns Djokovic . Federer complained about Nadal's grunting Friday and when the 13-time grand slam winner received a time violation warning from chair umpire Carlos Ramos in the first game of the second set, some at Rod Laver Arena applauded. That was simply the start of the spectacle. Nadal clutched his back and called for the trainer going off court for treatment. When he returned, there were boos from some sections of the crowd, a rare, if almost unheard of, occurrence for Nadal. ""I can understand very well the reaction,"" Nadal told reporters. ""They understood later that I was (hurt)."" He said he injured the back in the warm-up and the condition worsened as the first set progressed. ""Then at the beginning of the second set was the key moment that I felt, during a serve ... it was very stiff, very bad,"" Nadal said. ""But it's not the moment to talk about that. Stan is playing unbelievable."" During the medical timeout, Wawrinka jawed with Ramos, demanding to know what the injury was -- Ramos declined to tell the 28-year-old but tournament referee Wayne McKewen later obliged. A distraught Nadal couldn't help but cry -- because of the injury -- and with little on his serve, Wawrinka coasted to the second set. Nadal must have flashed back to 2011 in Melbourne, when a leg injury sustained against David Ferrer in the quarterfinals ended his chances of achieving the ""Rafa Slam"" -- four grand slam titles in succession. He missed last year's tournament as he recovered from a knee injury. ""It's true that I was not very lucky and this is a tournament that is painful for me,"" said Nadal. Such was the state of Nadal that a first retirement in a men's grand slam final in 24 years appeared a distinct possibility. ""The last thing I wanted to do was retire,"" said Nadal. ""At the same time it's tough to see yourself during the whole year working for a moment like this, and the moment arrives and you are not able to play at your best."" Nadal didn't call it quits, Wawrinka squandered break points in the opening game of the third and two more in the final game of the set. Nadal thereby maintained his streak of never losing a grand slam final in straight sets. Some consolation. Fireworks to mark Australia Day erupted at about the same time, and soon chants of ""Rafa, Rafa"" filled the stadium. With Nadal, though, continuing to lack pace on his serve, Wawrinka broke for 5-3 and closed the match out with a winning forehand. ""It's a final of a grand slam, so I'm really happy to win it,"" said Wawrinka. ""It's not the way a tennis player wants to win a match -- because the opponent is injured. ""Rafa is a really good friend. But when it happens, you have to take it. It's maybe once in my life I will appear in a grand slam final."" Not in 21 years had a men's player ousted the top two seeds at a grand slam, Djokovic being the No. 2. Nadal was thus deprived of a 14th major, which would have placed him joint second with Pete Sampras -- he was at Rod Laver Arena to present the trophies -- and three behind Federer on the men's all-time list. Nadal's plight Sunday is sure to dominate the headlines but Wawrinka's performance shouldn't be forgotten. With more oomph on his ground strokes now than Federer and earning free points on serve, nerves weren't a factor in the first set. ""The Wawrinka we have now has nothing to do with the Wawrinka who lost 12 times to Rafa,"" Patrick Mouratoglou, a Eurosport analyst and Serena Williams' coach, told CNN. ""He beat Djokovic and for sure this really changed something in his belief and ability to win a grand slam. ""And if you look at his game, he has so much more pace on his shots (than Federer), and that is so important against Rafa."" Good fortune doesn't hurt at a grand slam, and Nadal's ailment, combined with Wawrinka's opponent retiring in the first round and his foe in the third round pulling out altogether, aided him. But Wawrinka -- who took Djokovic to five sets in two majors last year -- has become consistent under Swedish coach Magnus Norman and will rise to a career high No. 3 in the world when the new rankings are released, five spots better than Federer. Courtesy of Wawrinka, the Big Four stranglehold at grand slams this decade is over. His talent is evident and his achievement will surely be applauded. On Sunday, however, it was Nadal who still commanded much of the attention. Just not for the reasons we all thought.

"London (CNN) -- Tony Benn, who has died in London aged 88, was an inspiration to all of us who wanted to make the world a more peaceful and more equal place. He came from a privileged and political family, his father and grandfather both MPs, and he would have become Lord Stansgate in the early 1960s if he had not fought to renounce his hereditary peerage. Luckily he won, stayed an MP instead of mouldering in Britain's upper House of Lords for the next five decades, and dedicated his life to socialist ideas and most importantly to campaigning for change. Tony was born in the aftermath of World War I. He was an airman in World War II, and often talked about his experience. He lost a brother in that war, but also saw it as a watershed, marking no return to the unemployment and fascism of the 1930s. As he said, the young conscripted troops became radicalized by the war, arguing that if there could be full employment in wartime, so there could be full employment in peacetime to build houses, hospitals, schools and all the other things people needed. He was Labour all his life, campaigning for the 1945 landslide, but in the last part of his life his main activity was outside Labour's structures. I remember vividly how he used this wartime experience on one occasion. Just after Gordon Brown became prime minister, we wanted to hold an anti-war demo going from Trafalgar Square to parliament, but the march was banned by the police. I received a phone call from Tony to say that he had just dropped a letter off in Downing St complaining about this decision and promising to defy it. Sure enough he turned up on the day wearing his World War II medals and demanding to march. We set off, daring the police to arrest us. They didn't. He quipped that he was leaving parliament in order to spend more time with politics. This was after the death of his beloved wife Caroline, herself a socialist campaigner and writer. He spent the rest of his life campaigning for a range of causes, but above all he was identified with the Stop the War Coalition, of which I became the convenor when we launched it in 2001. He campaigned and spoke at every demo, travelled round the country to hold rapturous and well-attended meetings, and became president of the campaign, a post he held up to his death. He was opposed to the wars the UK government and its U.S. allies were waging, including the latest attempt to start another war on Syria last summer. He also helped campaign against austerity, most recently through the People's Assembly. Tony was polite, disciplined, hard working, political: all the things you could wish for in a campaigner. He was a delight to talk to, interested always in ideas, technological change, history, and building broad united campaigns. One of the last conversation I had with him he stressed the importance of organizing, and wanted May 1, the international day of working class struggle, to be marked into 2014 as a day to rise up against austerity. That is an invitation I hope millions of people will take up. Maybe we could call it Tony Benn day. That would be a fitting legacy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lindsey German.","Tony Benn who has died in London aged 88, came from a privileged and political family .

"(CNN) -- The Australian Open is known as the ""Happy Slam."" The players are usually re-energized after the off-season and gush over the way the tournament is organized. But for the fourth day in a row in Melbourne, a multiple grand slam winner left the tournament without a smile on their face. Following Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and Novak Djokovic, two-time women's defending champion Victoria Azarenka became the latest big name bundled out when the Belorussian fell to Agnieszka Radwanska on Wednesday. Yes, the upsets keep coming. Radwanska not only defeated Azarenka in the quarterfinals to snap a seven-match losing streak against the world No. 2 but she didn't drop a game in the third set of the 6-1 5-7 6-0 victory. When Azarenka misfired to seal her fate on match point, the crowd at Rod Laver Arena roared its approval. With Djokovic departing Tuesday at the hands of Stanislas Wawrinka, it marked the first time in the Open Era both the men's and women's defending champions in Australia were eliminated at the quarterfinal stage. ""I think about today's match, what I did, what I could do better,"" Azarenka told reporters. ""But other players, different vibe, whatever, I don't really care about that."" Radwanska meets Dominika Cibulkova in the semifinals Thursday after the diminutive Slovak -- who sent Sharapova packing -- cruised past maiden grand slam quarterfinalist Simona Halep 6-3 6-0. ""This is for sure one of the greatest matches at the slam, especially here,"" Radwanska told reporters. ""(Azarenka) is playing great tennis here. ""Especially the third set was unbelievable.

"(CNN) -- Russia's stand off with Ukraine might be spilling over into the sporting arena with the idea floated for Fabio Capello's team to be barred from contesting June's World Cup, but the UEFA president believes this would be a travesty for the players who worked so hard to qualify for the finals in Brazil. Ukrainian officials and Western diplomats accuse Russia of sending thousands of troops into the Crimea region in the past week -- a claim Russia has denied. Earlier this week, an unnamed European Union official was reported to have told a BBC journalist that his organization may try to expel Russia from the 2014 finals. ""I don't know why 11 players would not be allowed to play at the World Cup. Where is their responsibility?"" Michel Platini told CNN. ""Why don't you (shut down) the Embassy? Embassies are still in the country."" Platini might now be an administrator, but he speaks from personal experience of how politics is never far away from sport. The former France international had a similar decision to make when considering whether to contest the 1978 World Cup or not. There were calls from various quarters to boycott the finals because of the repressive measures being undertaken by the military junta, which took charge in a coup in March 1976 and would rule until 1983. One of the most infamous periods in Argentina's history followed, as thousands of individuals -- primarily with left wing leanings -- disappeared during the 'Dirty War'. As the South American nation prepared to host its only World Cup to date, calls for a potential boycott were led by the Dutch whose team -- perhaps ironically -- would not just attend the event but reach the final as well. Amnesty International was also a prominent campaigner as was a group in France called COBA, the French acronym for the 'Committee for the Boycott of the World Cup in Argentina', who wanted the competition scrapped altogether. Despite the pressure, Platini -- who was just 20 at the time -- chose to play. ""It's always better to go and explain what you think is good rather than boycott,"" said the UEFA president. ""I think it's better to explain that you are not happy, which is the same opinion I had in 1978 when I was in Argentina for the World Cup,"" added the 58-year-old. ""I thought it was better to go and explain that we were not happy with what was happening in Argentina. ""It could be the same in Russia."" The Ukrainian Paralympic team is facing an equally tough choice as to whether it will boycott the Sochi Games or not. Ukraine's sports minister has already announced a personal boycott and as the tense diplomatic and military standoff continues with Russia, it's possible the whole team could follow suit. Should they do so, such a move could overshadow Friday's Opening Ceremony. In addition to Ukraine's sports minister, politicians from Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Canada and Poland are among those who have already said they will stay away. Earlier this week, the White House canceled a presidential delegation to the Paralympic Games. On Thursday, Germany announced it would not send governmental representatives in order to make a ""very clear political signal to Russia"", according to disabilities commissioner Verena Bentele. Ukraine Paralympic Committee spokeswoman Natalia Garach told CNN a decision on whether the Ukrainian team will boycott Sochi will be announced at a press conference at 0930 GMT on Friday.","Michel Platini dismisses calls to bar Russia from participating at World Cup in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal surrendered top spot in the English Premier League are being walloped 5-1 by Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday. The Gunners were left shell-shocked as the Reds ran riot in the opening quarter of the match. Martin Skrtel put the home side ahead in the opening minute, redirecting Steven Gerrard's free kick past Wojciech Szczesny. The Slovak center back doubled the lead nine minutes later with a looping header from a corner kick before Raheem Sterling tapped in from close range in the 16th minute after Luis Suarez swept in a low cross from the right. Worse was to come for the visitors four minutes later when Daniel Sturridge side-footed home a fourth after meeting a superb through ball from Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho. Arsenal were lucky not to concede again in the first half but soon found themselves five goals down when Sterling scored at the second attempt in the 52nd minute after Szczesny had blocked his original effort. Mikel Arteta scored a consolation goal in the 69th minute -- converting from the penalty spot after Gerrard had fouled Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain in the box moments earlier. But nothing could hide the fact that this had been a crushing defeat for the North Londoners as they chase a first league title in a decade. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger described it as ""a very poor day"" after the match. ""Only the fans were good for 90 minutes. All the rest on our side, we were poor -- defensively, offensively -- and (the goals) were all scored in slow-motion,"" Wenger told BT Sport. ""Overall, on top of that, we were caught on two set-pieces at the start. But the performance was very poor and Liverpool played very well, so congratulations to them. We have to bounce back from that, and as quickly as possible."" Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers was understandably delighted. ""It was an incredible performance. It's not the first time we've been outstanding at home, but everything about us today was incredible. Everything was outstanding. ""We've been getting better and better. We've got a lot of young players, developing well. But for us it's just about improving."" Arsenal, who play Manchester United in their next league match on Wednesday, drop one place to second, while Liverpool consolidate fourth place and now have 50 points. Chelsea top after Hazard hat-trick . After outwitting Manchester City in the week, Chelsea rise to first after beating Newcastle United 3-0 and Manchester City dropped points against Norwich City. Jose Mourinho's side, who outwitted City on Monday, outplayed their Geordie visitors at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Eden Hazard, who played a starring role in the 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium, turned in another star performance this time scoring a hat-trick to lift the Blues to 56 points, one point ahead of Arsenal. Manuel Pellegrini's usually free-scoring City side failed to find the net for the second successive match drawing 0-0 at Carrow Road -- a result which sees them slip down to third with 54 points. Elsewhere, West Ham United and Crystal Palace eased relegation worries with much needed wins. Two goals from Kevin Nolan at the start of the second half saw the Hammers ease to a 2-0 win away to Aston Villa. The result lifts them to 14th in the table, one place and one point below Crystal Palace who beat West Bromwich Albion 3-1 at Selhurst Park. Southampton and Stoke City drew 2-2, but Sunderland, after an emphatic win 3-0 against local rivals Newcastle in the Tyne-Wear derby, slumped to a 2-0 defeat against Hull City.

"Bray, England (CNN) -- Think about the most memorable meal you ever had. Was it just the taste you remember, or everything else around it? To me, food is as much about the moment, the occasion, the location and the company as it is about the taste. It is the only thing we do that involves all the senses. It has the ability to generate so much emotion and so much memory. It has endless possibilities. It is one of those subjects where the more you learn about it; the more you realize you don't know. I was born in the'60s and grew up in the '70s -- not exactly the best decade for food in British history. It was horrendous. It was a time when, as a nation, we excelled in art and music and acting and photography and fashion -- all creative skills ... all apart from cooking. In those days there was only one type of pasta you could buy in the supermarket -- spaghetti in a blue wrapper. With olive oil you had to go to the chemist because you never cooked with it -- you poured it into your ears to clear out the wax. I had never eaten an oyster before. I had never eaten lobster. I had never even been to a gastronomic restaurant in any shape or form. More from Human to Hero: Former piano prodigy Benjamin Grosvenor . When I was a teenager, we used to go to Cornwall and the south coast of England every year for our summer holiday. Then one year we went to France and I had the lucky experience of going to a three Michelin-starred restaurant with my sister and parents. It was as if I had fallen down some rabbit hole into a wonderland. It was just incredible. We sat outside at the side of a cliff in this valley of olives. There were the trees; the noise of the feet of the waiting staff crunching on the gravel; the noise of the crickets filled the air; the sommelier with his handlebar moustache and leather apron; the wine list the size of something out of the tablet of a Cecil B. DeMille film; the cheese trolley the sound of a chariot. They were pouring sauces into souffles, carving legs of lamb at the table. There was just this whole new world and that was it, that's when I got hooked. It got under my skin. I left school with an A-level in art. I had failed my chemistry exams -- so I am clearly not a scientist, but at the age of 18, I got a book written by a guy called Harold McGee, which was all about the science of cooking. Harold had written a section in the book where he said that browning meat doesn't keep in the juices -- and that flew in the face of all the things I had learned about classical French cooking up until then. So from that moment on, I questioned everything. I was like one of those annoying kids going 'Why? Why?!' Thinking about it now, if I had asked that many questions at school, I would have done a lot better. More from Human to Hero: Former Olympic rower Matthew Pinsent . So from the age of 18 or so, I was working, saving up. I was doing all sorts of jobs: I started off selling office equipment, which I hated. I did a few other jobs and finally ended up working for my dad as a credit controller -- basically accounting. It was a nine-to-five job, and at half past three every day I guarantee you would find me sitting, snoring at my desk. I would save for six months and blow it on a two-week trip to France, and it was almost as if I couldn't think about anything else after that. In those two weeks I would go to restaurants -- I would pick three or four big ones that would cost a lot of money. I remember going down the wine list and thinking, 'Eeek, I cant do that, I cant buy that one,"" or I'd say 'I'll have that wine but can I just have one glass please?' I opened The Fat Duck in 1995, staffed by just myself and a pot-washer, that was it. I was cooking French bistro things - steak and chips, lemon tart and those kinds of things. My first original dish creation was a just few years before. It was 'triple cooked chips' -- my solution to the problem of why chips go soggy. And so even though then I was doing bistro cooking, that element of science -- the knowledge of what happens when we cook on a scientific level -- had already started to influence my food. Along the journey from then to now I was two days away from going bankrupt -- I had to sell a house, sell cars, had to sell everything just to keep the restaurant going. You kind of kiss goodbye to a life for a big chunk of time. You have levels of exhaustion you just didn't know were possible. I think one week I had just twelve hours sleep. And it is relentless. It is every day. It's not just that you cook nice a meal. You finish and then you have to clean everything down and then you have to start again the next day. So you have to sacrifice everything, but at the same time you could say it is a very selfish pursuit. I'm in a position now that has exceeded anything I could ever have hoped or dreamed for, but I don't even know what it was that was driving me. I didn't really have an ambition; I just wanted to be better and better and better, and it was never good enough.","Heston Blumenthal is founder of The Fat Duck, regularly voted the world's best restaurant .

"Washington (CNN) -- Here are six things you learned on ""Inside Politics."" 1. GOP jitters in Florida: The special House election in Florida's 13th Congressional District is Tuesday, but many plugged-in Republicans there are predicting defeat -- and are already finger pointing. It's a competitive district, but the seat has been in GOP hands for decades, so a win by Democrat Alex Sink would sting the GOP, and no doubt set off a round of debate about the party's midterm election strategy -- despite the fact history suggests the results of special elections often say very little about what will happen come November. Again, let's await the results. But already many Republicans involved in the race are complaining the party is falling short of its promise to make dramatic improvements in its use of data and technology to identify and turnout voters. 2. GOP outreach: Maeve Reston of the Los Angeles Times made note of another Republican promise being called into question. Remember after Mitt Romney's 2012 loss, there was a pledge for much more aggressive GOP outreach to younger voters, women, African Americans and Latinos. Maeve noted that at this weekend's big Conservative Political Action Conference ""there was strikingly a lack of a message still at this point to these voter groups that they have had such a tough time with...They are going into all of these communities but they are still figuring out what they are going to say and so I think we need to watch very closely as to whether there is any evidence that they are making progress on that front."" 3. Crushing his critics: Audie Cornish of National Public Radio noted the dramatic shift from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell: usually silent about his primary opponent and conservative groups that attack him, now suddenly he vows to ""crush them everywhere."" In a new radio ad, McConnell specifically attacks the Senate Conservative Fund, which had made a name for itself the last few cycles by supporting primary challenges to GOP establishment figures. ""So the gloves are not just off, they are in another room, they are under the bed,"" is Audie's take on the McConnell shift. ""It just seems that they are going to go hard."" 4. The right stuff?: Look for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to highlight his anti-abortion views as part of an effort to show the conservative GOP base it's unfair to dismiss him as just another Northeast moderate. Robert Costa of the Washington Post shares a conversation with Christie's top political operative. ""All he was telling me about was Chris Christie's pro-life record and at CPAC we heard that from Chris Christie,"" Robert said. ""My predictions is in the coming months as Christie continues to travel ... he's going to emphasize that pro-life record, looking ahead to Iowa and South Caroline in the 2016 campaign."" 5. Deep chill: One person Christie apparently isn't interested in persuading is fellow Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. And vice versa. CNN's Peter Hamby took us behind the CPAC curtain to show how the deep chill between the two 2016 prospects continues. Christie is chairman of the Republican Governors Association; Jindal is the vice chairman. Both spoke at CPAC. ""I'm told that these two didn't even cross paths backstage, there was no time set up to meet - even say hello in this green room where all these stars were crossing paths,"" Peter reports. ""Jindal spoke right after Chris Christie and they didn't even talk afterward."" A flashback to Jindal's frosty defense of Christie over Bridgegate a month ago: . 6. Hamlet on the Merrimack? Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown and key allies are suddenly sending signals he intends to jump into the 2014 Senate race in New Hampshire. Brown has been debating for months about whether to challenge Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen, torn, friends say, about whether he should instead run for president in 2016, or just forgo running for elective office again. Well a number of GOP sources in New Hampshire report receiving calls in recent days from Brown or his top allies, and there's word from GOP operatives that there are conversations about building a Senate campaign staff. So all systems are go? Not so fast. Because Brown has been pondering this for months, the GOP activists I spoke to say they won't believe it until he makes a public statement or files candidacy papers. The wait for Brown's final answer may be short. ""I will make an announcement sooner, rather than later,"" he told Neil Cavuto of Fox News on Thursday. ""Obviously, it's a very, very big decision --a very, very big decision for me and my family. And I'm going to make sure that I cross all T's and dot all I's. So it will be sooner, rather than later, and I'll certainly let everyone know.","The special election for Florida's 13th district is Tuesday and the GOP predicts defeat .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Two bombings overnight near major shrines in the holy Shiite city of Karbala left at least three people dead and 15 others wounded, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said Thursday. One of the blasts to hit Karbala came close to the Imam Abbas mosque, pictured here in August. There were no claims of responsibility so far for incidents at the Imam Hussein and Imam Abbas mosques -- two of the holiest shrines for Shiite Muslims -- who regularly make pilgrimages to the sites in the south-central Iraqi city. The first bomb, which had been placed in a trash bag, detonated shortly after 11 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Wednesday about 800 meters (875 yards) from the Imam Hussein shrine and 200 meters (218 yards) from an Iraqi security forces checkpoint, the official said. One woman was killed and 12 others, including women and children, were wounded. About an hour later, an explosive device placed in a car detonated about 500 meters (547 yards) from the Imam Abbas shrine, the official said. The attack killed one civilian and wounded three, and damaged a number of the houses in the area. The two shrines are about several hundred meters from each other. Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, is revered by Shiites, while Abbas is Hussein's half-brother. Their tombs are located in the shrines. Fierce fighting occurred near the shrines in Karbala in August 2007 between Shiite rivals -- members of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army Mehdi Army and security officers affiliated with the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. The battles spread to other Shiite communities in Iraq, and eventually died down and led to al-Sadr's call for a cessation of activities by the militia. U.S. and Iraqi authorities said that cease-fire was a factor in decreasing the violence that had been raging in Iraq. Bomb attacks near other religious shrines in Iraq have happened several times in the past. The bombing of the Askariya Mosque, a Shiite shrine in the northern Iraqi city of Samarra in February 2006, sparked sectarian violence that led to thousands of deaths and caused people to flee their homes for other parts of Iraq and other countries. In Baghdad's Sadr City, a Shiite neighborhood, a roadside bomb killed three Housing Ministry employees and wounded three others Thursday morning. The people were in a minibus at the time, the Interior Ministry said.","Two bombs near shrines in holy city of Karbala leave at last three people dead .

"(CNN) -- Amid the continuing bloodshed and turmoil in Syria, one thing is becoming clear: The Assad regime's propaganda campaign against the opposition is resonating with some countries in the West and elsewhere. The regime has consistently characterized its opponents as ""terrorists."" And while the once peaceful Arab Spring-inspired demonstrations have long morphed into an armed insurrection that includes a wide array of Islamist groups of varying militancy, some in the international community are allowing their all-consuming fear of ""terrorism"" prevent them from recognizing an equally dangerous ideology that not long ago engulfed the entire ""world"" in a war that cost millions of people their lives, and which was responsible for unimaginable atrocities, the full scope of which is still being ascertained today. Those who have adopted the view that the Assad regime's continuation in power is a ""lesser of two evils"" should be under no illusions as to what their preferred option is: Fascism. If history is any indication, once a fascist ""mindset"" has been inculcated into the support base of a regime, peace seldom follows. The quest for vanquishing enemies -- both internal and external -- never ceases. The international community's reluctance to punish Syrian Bashar al-Assad over his obliteration of all norms governing civil wars, should make it consider the strong possibility that it will be compelled to confront him at some point in the near future, when he defies the rules of international relations by launching an unprovoked military attack against a nation on which he blames all Syria's troubles. The most likely candidate is Saudi Arabia. While this scenario seems remote for a number of reasons -- logistics and the tattered state of the Syrian economy and military being the three most obvious -- one should remember that past fascist regimes' ill-fated military adventures also took others by surprise, as they seemed to defy conventional wisdom on several fronts. Much like the ideologies that justify terrorism, fascism operates within unique moral parameters and therefore its calculus will always confound those who do not adhere to it. A scholar on terrorism recently put it best when he wrote that ""sacred values"" produce ""devoted actors (as opposed to rational actors), who are willing to resort to extreme violence with little regard to risks and rewards or costs and consequences."" The same is true of the most militant variants of fascism. People who dismiss such a scenario should listen carefully to al-Assad's recent verbal assault against what he calls ""Wahhabism"" and how it should be ""eradicated from the root."" Those who doubt that such an attack is within the realm of possibilities should remember another Baathist regime that based its legitimacy on military prowess and delusions of grandeur and that went from one devastating war to another; former Iraq President Saddam Hussein's. At the time of his war with Iran, many considered him ""the lesser of two evils."" In a fascist state, preserving the nation's security, stability and unity against the machinations of internal and external enemies is dogma; it is the founding myth of the Syrian regime. The fact that Assad's forces have killed tens of thousands of Syrians and thousands more are unaccounted for, turned millions of others into refugees, leveled entire cities to the ground, reduced the size of the Syrian economy to a fraction of what it was before the civil war and turned Syria into the favorite destination of Islamist militants worldwide in the process, should give those who are ready to turn a new page with him pause. Writing in 1944, the British novelist George Orwell justifiably advised against ""degrade[ing] it to the level of a swearword"" by labeling anything with which we strongly disagree as ""fascism."" However, given its reprehensible brutality, insidious internal politics, and incendiary rhetoric over the past three years, one would be hard pressed to describe the Syrian regime as anything other than that. While scholars have long struggled with succinctly defining fascism and its wide variants, a cursory look at the modus operandi of the Assad regime suggests that it embodies the most salient characteristics of the most militant type of fascism. A hallmark of fascism is the reverence for the ""leader"" who becomes the personification of the nation; an attack on him becomes an attack on the entire nation. It is he who sets the vision for the people and there is little room for individual autonomy. Al-Assad has left no doubt that he would rather destroy Syria than step down. Fear, uncertainty, distrust . Like Saddam Hussein, al-Assad's pervasive internal security apparatus has adversely affected the political culture of millions of his countrymen, allowing fear, uncertainly and distrust to dominate people's psyches. And while Hussein's torture chambers were revealed after the regime was toppled in 2003, Bashar's security forces' atrocities are being documented on a daily basis, often by the perpetrators themselves. The recent disclosure by three war crimes prosecutors of gut-wrenching photographs showing the emaciated corpses of thousands of detainees who died in al-Assad's jails was more evidence suggesting that his atrocities are coming perilously close to those committed by the most infamous fascist regime in history: Nazi Germany. (CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs, documents and testimony referenced in the report, and is relying on the conclusions of the team behind it, which includes international criminal prosecutors, a forensic pathologist, an anthropologist and an expert in digital imaging. The Syrian regime denies torturing detainees. The Syrian Ministry of Justice dismissed the report, telling Al Jazeera it was politicized and lacking of objectivity and professionalism. Like other fascists before him, al-Assad has instilled an insidious ideology in his followers by controlling the media, and using the education system to inculcate a mind-set that glorifies war, militarism and witch-hunts. His regime has also become masterful at using short slogans intended to rouse his supporters' nationalism and emotions, while simultaneously dehumanizing all of Syria's ""enemies."" It is this indoctrination that enables al-Assad's henchmen to kidnap thousands of children out of their homes and torture them to death. It is also this pathological outlook that justifies al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons against civilian centers on more than one occasion. (Al-Assad denies that his troops had anything to do with the attacks.) Fascist regimes also have a history of using religion and ethnicity to widen cleavages in society to ensure that different groups do not conspire against them. Despite all their talk about secularism, both Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad used religion to sow division, distrust and even fear among the various religious and ethnic groups. Both brutally oppressed the religious majority and preyed on the fears of religious and ethnic minorities. Potential attacks? Saddam Hussein surprised many when he attacked Iran and shocked the world when he invaded Kuwait. And while al-Assad's reign thus far has not included such reckless military adventures, the past three years have unmasked the true fascist character of his regime. Should he regain full control over Syria, al-Assad might feel emboldened and attack his main adversaries. If Syria becomes a full-fledged failed state, he may feel more compelled to deflect from his domestic weakness by undertaking a ""heroic"" show of strength to raise the morale of his supporters and to bring back to the fold some of his opponents under the banner of nationalism. As an added bonus, such an attack would also test the resolve of the United States and its military footprint in the Gulf. The world has repeatedly underestimated the fascist mind-set. But just as it is standing united against terrorism, the international community should not forget the devastation that fascism unleashed on the world and realize that its specter is currently hovering over the Middle East. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fahad Nazer.","A fear of ""terrorism"" is obscuring the threat of fascism in Syria, writes Fahad Nazer .
Once a fascist mindset has been instilled into a support base, peace seldom follows, he says .
If al-Assad's regime were to regain control of Syria, it might turn on other nations, he says .

"(CNN) -- Does anyone know how to say ""Did that really just happen?"" in Russian? Who can predict how the women's figure skating will turn out? Who just won his record-setting 13th medal? It's in the nyet . What a strange day if you are a Russian Olympics fan. The hockey team got knocked out; amazing figure skater Julia Lipnitskaya tumbled during her short program; and you saw a home-nation gold medal from a foreign-grown snowboarder. The country is in shock over the hockey team's 3-1 loss to Finland. Remember the Russians (or Soviets) used to own the gold medal, but they haven't won one in 12 years. More than one hour after the loss, a Sochi bear mascot sat in the empty hockey arena stands, head in paw. The media ganged up on Russian coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov at the news conference. Steve Politi of the Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey, said two of the best early questions were ""How guilty are you feeling?"" and ""Is it a catastrophe?"" ""I take full responsibility for our team's performance,"" the coach said, according to a translator. It's hard to say the Games have been ruined for a country that has won a second-best 22 medals, buuuuuuuuuut ... At least in the case of Lipnitskaya, she didn't fall out of medal contention. She has the ability to lift the nation's spirits if she can perform magnificently in Thursday's free program and get a bronze or silver. Gold seems out of reach, but it is up to the judges. And there's probably a little bit of pride in the husband-and-wife combination of Vic Wild and Alena Zavarzina. They competed 15 minutes apart in the parallel giant slalom with Wild, who became a Russian citizen two years ago, winning gold. His wife won bronze in the women's event. ""It was incredible to win with Alena. We are together all the time. If one of us has success and the other doesn't it's great but it's not that great, but for both of us to have success on the same day is a dream come true. Maybe I will wake up soon,"" he said. Within reach . South Korea's Yuna Kim has a lot to think about. This is her last Olympics. She has skated only a few times in competition since winning a gold medal in Vancouver, leading to constant questions about her trying to repeat as champion. She's also trying to inspire young figure skaters in the country that will host the next Winter Olympics. And now she's less than a point ahead of two other skaters after the short program in women's figure skating. Adelina Sotnikova of Russia and Carolina Kostner of Italy are second and third, respectively. Kim, who has only skated in four international events since winning in 2010, is retiring after these Games. She will skate last on Thursday. It's not a position she likes. ""But I have had this experience before. It won't be a big problem,"" she said. U.S. skaters Gracie Gold, who is six points behind and fourth, and Ashley Wagner have outside chances at medals. ""Tonight was definitely nerve-racking, I'll be honest about that. But I'm set up well for the long program,"" said Wagner, who is in sixth and trails by nine points. Hot diggity, Ligety! They call Ted Ligety ""Mr. GS."" It should be amended to ""Mr. Golden GS."" The overwhelming favorite in the men's giant slalom gave the opposition no chance at winning Wednesday with a sizzling first run and a steady, self-assured second run that had the crowd congratulating him before he even reached the finish. ""This is really awesome. This is the event I wanted the most. This is the event I have been putting so much pressure on myself to win, so to pull through is an awesome feeling,"" he said. Ligety became the first American man to win the event and joined Andrea Mead Lawrence as the only two U.S. skiers with two golds in alpine skiing. The 29-year-old led by almost a full second after the first run, but wasn't totally comfortable with such a huge margin. ""If you blow out taking too much risk, you look stupid. If you go too easy and blow your lead, you look even more stupid."" he said. We would say you looked stupendous instead. Hope you ski as well in the slalom. Hope you mess up -- but not much . Kaillie Humphries and Elana Meyers are friends. Meyers even invited her Canadian rival to her wedding in April. But as Humphries stood with her teammate Heather Moyse at the bottom of the bobsled track Wednesday, waiting for Meyers to make her final run, she did hope for her pal to have a bobble here or hit there. ""I never wish bad on people, but I was thinking, 'Just make a few mistakes, please,' "" she told reporters. And in a sport where it takes four runs to crown an Olympic champion, it was a tenth of a second that came between the winning Humphries and Meyers. It was a hit at the top that Meyers blamed for the loss. ""I know I'm going to get crap, and people will say it's a disappointment, but I'm not disappointed,"" said Meyers, who along with teammate Lauryn Williams led after three runs. ""I couldn't be prouder. I'm glad for silver, I didn't deserve the gold medal today."" Williams became the fifth Olympian to medal in the Summer and Winter Games. ""This has been the most exciting experience of my life,"" she said of her recent immersion into the sport. ""I am so happy to have fallen into bobsled. Who would have thought six months ago I would be bobsledding, let alone on the podium at the Olympics?"" Eight golds, four silvers, one bronze . He won his first medal in 1998 in the biathlon sprint. Four Olympics later he is still adding to what is now a record-setting personal medal table. Ole Einar Bjoerndalen won his 13th Olympic medal Wednesday, putting him alone atop the all-time individual medal table for the Winter games. His eight gold medals are also a record. He raced the third leg in the new mixed relay competition and put Norway far ahead, where it stayed, beating the Czech Republic by 32 seconds. ""I'm really grateful for this victory,"" he said, in typical understated fashion. ""I'm happy for my team."" Is there one more podium in the bag? The men's relay is Saturday.","Husband: How was your day? Wife: Great, I got a bronze. You? Husband: A gold .

"(CNN) -- The maker of a mobile game highlighting the uglier side of electronics production has seen the game banned from Apple's App Store just hours after its release. The creators of ""Phone Story"" describe it as a game that ""attempts to provoke a critical reflection on its own technological platform."" According to the developer's website, the game involves a player in cartoon versions of real-world scenarios involving mineral mining in the Congo, the reported suicides of workers at an Apple manufacturer's plant in China, the ""planned obsolescence"" of tech gadgets and the resulting environmental impact. As the most profitable consumer-electronics company in the world, Apple has been front and center of discussions about all of those issues. Paolo Pedercini, the game's Italian developer, posted a blog item on his Twitter feed Tuesday announcing the app had been pulled under the header ""Phone Story RIP (13/09/2011 - 13/09/2011)."" He said Apple cited sections of its guidelines that ban apps that depict violence or abuse toward children, ""excessively objectionable or crude content"" or paid apps that solicit donations to causes. The game's website says proceeds go to workers' groups and other nonprofit organizations. In response, Pedercini said he's planning a new app that ""depicts the violence and abuse of children involved in the electronic manufacturing supply chain in a noncrude and nonobjectionable way."" Apple's response was succinct. ""We removed this app from the App Store because it violates its developer guidelines,"" said Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr. Neumayr would not elaborate and didn't confirm or deny that the sections Pedercini cited are correct. The game is still available for $1 in the Android Market. It's not the first time Apple has been embroiled in controversies over electronics production (which, in fairness, are the same for many manufacturers of computers, phones and other gadgets). Wired magazine, for one, has taken a close look at conditions at the Foxconn factory in China that makes iPhones. The report describes nets strung around the building after a rash of worker suicides. Amnesty International and other organizations have decried the way coltan, a mineral necessary for mobile phones, is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- where there are reports of bloody violence to control the coltan trade and deadly conditions for workers held in slavelike conditions. One Amnesty documentary calls it ""Blood Coltan,"" comparing the mineral to the ""blood diamonds"" mined in some African nations. And environmental groups such as Greenpeace have blasted Apple's environmental impact, saying its products contain hazardous chemicals and their short life spans have led to massive waste. On its site, Apple lists ""supplier responsibility"" actions it takes to ensure ""the highest standards of social responsibility wherever our products are made."" ""We insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes,"" the page says. Apple's site says it regularly audits the companies it partners with and works with those firms to make improvements when needed.","Apple bans mobile game that shows the uglier side of electronics production .

"(CNN) -- A new World Bank study on illegal logging reports that a football field of forest is clear-cut every two seconds around the globe and the problem is now a ""global epidemic."" The report estimates that illegal logging accounts for as much as 90% of all timber felled each year, generating between $10 to $15 billion. The report says the logging is mostly controlled by organized crime, and ill-gotten gains are used to pay corrupt government officials at all levels to turn a blind eye. ""Forestry's criminal justice system is broken. Despite compelling data and evidence showing that illegal logging is a worldwide epidemic, most forest crimes go undetected, unreported, or are ignored,"" says the 56-page report released Tuesday. ""All too often, investigations—in the rare event that they do take place—are amateurish and inconclusive."" Read more: Brazil vote sparks fears for future of rainforests . A four-year study in Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia and the Philippines -- four forest-rich countries -- found that the probability of illegal loggers being penalized is less than 0.1% .

Estimates of financial losses from illegal logging don't consider ""the enormous environmental, economic and societal costs— biodiversity threats, increased carbon emissions and undermined livelihoods of rural peoples,"" the report says. ""Large-scale illegal operations are carried out by sophisticated criminal networks, and law enforcement actions need to be focused on the 'masterminds' behind these networks—and the high-level corrupt officials who enable and protect them,"" the report says.

"(CNN) -- There are few philosophers whose very name provokes more violent responses than Karl Marx. His stern face, framed by a mass of gray hair, symbolizes for many Americans the costly battles of the 20th century: battles against communism, socialism, and authoritarianism fought in defense of democracy and free-market capitalism. As successive generations of Americans waged those fights, the philosophical disputes at the core of the conflicts embedded themselves into the American soul. So much so that when the ""evil empire,"" whose seeds sprouted from Marx's doctrine, died as a result of the revolutions of 1989, the ideological battle did not. Though the Soviet Union is but a memory, and that other communist behemoth -- China -- has mutated into a capitalist autocracy, the specter of Marx himself remains as potent as ever in 21st century U.S. political discourse. Since 2008 especially, with the fall of financial markets and the rise of Barack Obama, the charge ""Marxist"" has been hurled like toxic sludge against politicians seen as ready to redistribute wealth (to the advantage of most Americans), expand social safety nets, or ensure that all children receive a good education. Critics say these steps are merely the first along a slippery slope that inevitably ends in outright state control. Amid these warnings, the communist horrors of the 20th century float like dark apparitions, reminding us of the bad old days. But I wonder how many of those who invoke the name of Marx in order to stifle political debate actually believe their own propaganda. Or are they conjuring up a convenient bogeyman at a time of great uncertainty. Do they raise Marx's image in order to deflect attention from slightly warmer bodies (Marx has been dead for 128 years)in positions of political or economic power who are actually more pernicious? I also wonder whether those who use Marx's name, and those who tremble at the thought of him, actually know much about the man. Are they reacting to Karl Marx or those things done in his name? I believe it is the latter. I also believe it is time to understand Marx so that we are no longer made to fear him. When I began working on a biography of Marx's family in 2003, I was well acquainted with his theories. I knew, as most do, the history of the governments formed to reflect the state he had supposedly envisioned. I knew of the atrocities committed by those said to be his followers. I had not, however, been properly introduced to the man himself. What I discovered was not what I expected. Karl Marx was a middle-class philosopher, economist, and journalist (whose main employer was a New York newspaper). He was also flawed in the extreme. He drank excessively, behaved shamefully in his home life, and worked obsessionally, though he produced little that earned him money or recognition during his lifetime. These flaws, however, made him more interesting because, despite being in a state of near constant personal crisis, he was able to accomplish what he set out to do -- he changed the world. Marx began his opposition activities as a youth in Prussia against an absolute monarch who could not see, or perhaps chose not to see, that society was changing. The industrial revolution was spreading eastward and Prussian businessmen were eager to expand with it. But the old system of government would not allow for such progress. The king would not allow the democratic reforms that were the handmaidens of the new industrial order. This was Marx's first battle, to expose the contradictions between the centuries-old monarchical system and the world as it existed in the first half of the 19th century. According to Marx, it was only natural that as the means of production changed -- in this case a move from an agricultural base to an industrial one -- society would be altered. And if, as he believed, a government's sole function was to serve the people, then government must also change. Marx saw this social evolution as inevitable. It only became revolution when the kings and their minions refused to reform. By the 1850s, the industrialists had gained political power after revolts across Europe in 1848 caused kings to view proto-capitalists as allies against radicalized lower classes. The wheels of industry were humming, as were the halls of finance, where a new breed of speculator was born, addicted to risk in his quest for ever greater profit. Marx quickly recognized that capitalism would institutionalize social and economic instability. The system's inherent hunger for new markets, new consumers, new and cheaper methods of production in order to increase the flow of capital would result in a destructive system of boom and bust. After each cataclysm, he predicted, the number of capitalists at the top of the pyramid would be smaller, while the base of disaffected workers grew. Gradually even the middle class would be included. Marx believed that industrial capitalism had also created a new system of repression and exploitation. Politically and socially men were no more equal under this new order than they had been under a monarchy. Rights belonged to those with money and property; those with only a strong back or skilled hands could not even vote. Financially, those filling the ranks of the industrial workforce were arguably worse off. There was evidence aplenty to support Marx's assessment. He lived in London, the richest city in the world. And yet as great as was its wealth, much greater was its poverty. In Marx's neighborhood, some people rented a space in a bed and called it comfort. Others paid for a few inches on a stairwell and called it home. Marx summed up the situation saying, ""There must be something rotten in the very core of a social system which increases its wealth without diminishing its misery."" This is the field where Marx's ideas grew. He famously spent year after year in the British Museum Reading Room, trying to understand this new system, predict its course, and, finally, offer an alternative. Throughout the 16 years before he produced his greatest literary work Das Kapital, Marx's family lived in near continual destitution. Their sole consolation was that they believed Marx's work was noble and important, and that their suffering was small compared with the majority of people who sacrificed their lives so someone else could live in luxury. Das Kapital and Marx's other political-economic writings were only one aspect of his work. He was also an organizer and educator. Through various small groups, he tried to teach workers, who had neither formal education nor viewed themselves as a political force. The courses included language, literature and history, but mostly politics and economics. Marx was convinced that the only way to successfully change society was to educate the population so that it could eventually lead itself. In 1864, the most important of his many organizational endeavors was born, the International Working Men's Association. Its goal was to connect workers and trade unions throughout Europe and America to protect their rights in the face of an increasingly powerful capitalist system, whose tentacles had spread beyond individual nations and were encircling the globe. Marx recognized the working man's greatest power was his number. Marx died in 1883, before his books gained a wide readership and before the workers he had been fighting for took their places in government as representatives of labor and socialist political parties. It had taken decades of struggle -- largely nonviolent -- for this to occur. But Marx knew the path to progress would be slow, and that ultimately the best way to re-balance society was through the ballot box. He also believed, however, that the working man had the right to revolt if those in power tried to deny him such political expression -- free speech, free assembly, freedom of the press -- and the vote. Marx's actual vision for a government of the future was vague, which no doubt is why it has produced so many variants. But he believed ultimately mankind would naturally evolve out of capitalism and socialism, and embrace a communist society in which government was no longer necessary at all. It is a utopian dream that has occurred nowhere -- least of all in the countries most associated with his name. Today, many people know Marx only through the crimes of the former communist countries. But Marx's ideas also helped give birth to mainstream political parties in Western Europe -- Britain's Labour Party, Spain's Socialist Party, France's Socialist Party, and Germany's Social Democratic Party. And yet, for some reason in America, these parties are generally not considered part of Marx's legacy. In the United States, we have been taught to fear Marx for so long that we have forgotten those parts of his philosophy that have become integral to our own lives -- from free education to the right to bear arms. In fact, the era in modern American history that was most ""Marxist"" was the 1950s, when union membership was high, personal wealth spread more equitably, and the gap between the rich and poor relatively slim.

If his name is used in political discourse, it should be done in the manner of other great thinkers: as a source of ideas. Whether or not we agree with him, there are lessons to be learned from Marx.

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams remains on course to meet her sister Venus in the final of the Dubai Duty Free Championships after both won their quarterfinal matches on Thursday. The world No. 1, who crashed out of the Australian Open last month to Ana Ivanovic, made light work of Serbian opposition this time around beating Jelena Jankovic 6-2 6-2 to set a semifinal against either Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain or France's Alize Cornet. ""It definitely felt a lot more comfortable than my first match,"" Williams said, WTATennis.com reported, referring to her 7-6 6-0 win over Ekaterina Makarova on Tuesday. ""There were some shots I missed today that I would never have missed a month ago, so I'm still getting a little rust off, but it feels good overall. And I'm still trying to make sure I keep going in the right direction,"" Williams added. Earlier, sister Venus overcame Italy's Flavia Pennetta 6-3 7-5 to set up a semifinal clash with Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki. Surprisingly, Williams had lost four times in their seven previous meetings which, bar a couple of matches, have been tight affairs. Thursday's quarterfinal was no different with Pennetta clinching an early break of serve to go up 3-1 in the first, but it proved to be a false dawn for the world No. 22 as Williams reeled off seven games on the trot to take the first set and go up a break early in the second. Pennetta eventually fought back to level the set at five games all before Williams regained her composure to serve out the match. ""She keeps fighting. She stays relevant. That's what she does really well - she stays in the point,"" Williams said afterwards, WTATennis.com reported. ""I have to give her credit for that. I think I could have maybe made a couple more shots, but it's not always easy against someone who competes as well as her. She's been playing well,"" Williams added. The last time 33-year-old Venus beat her younger sister was in semifinals in Dubai in 2009. Serena has won their last five meetings and leads the head-to-head 14 matches to seven. Eighth seed Wozniacki made lighter work of her match against Sorana Cirstea downing the Romanian 6-1 6-2.","Serena Williams and sister Venus on course for final after quarterfinal wins on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Did you know that the ""frequency hopping"" technology that is vital to much of our military technology and helps keep your cell phone and your GPS devices secure was developed and patented by a famous movie star? Did you know that there was an amazing 16-year-old patriot who outdid Paul Revere, riding 45 miles in the pouring rain to warn New York colonial militias that ""the British are coming""? Did you know that there was a secret agent, code named ""355,"" who worked for George Washington's band of spies, the Culper Ring? The agent supplied key intelligence on British activities during the Revolutionary War, and she was so good at keeping a secret that we still don't know her real name. If you don't know about all these people, it's understandable. Their stories aren't told widely or often -- perhaps because they were all women. For some reason or other, when the story of our country is told, women -- really great women -- have tended to be left out of the telling. You see the results everywhere you look: . -- A survey of U.S. history textbooks found that only 10% of the individuals identified in the texts were women. -- Less than 8% of the 2,560 national historic landmarks chronicle the achievements of women. -- Of the 210 statues in the U.S. Capitol, only 15 are of female leaders. That's the bad news. The good news is that thanks to a strong bipartisan effort in Congress, we may soon be one step closer to addressing this imbalance by establishing a National Women's History Museum in Washington. Together, we have introduced a common-sense bill to move this idea forward. We have more than 73 bipartisan co-sponsors in the House, 19 in the Senate and a national coalition of women's groups behind us. We recognize money is tight -- that's why we're not asking for taxpayer support. Private donations would fund the museum's construction and operation. A vital part of recognizing equal rights for women is acknowledging and commemorating the deep and lasting contributions women have made throughout history. When young people visit our nation's capital, they should have a chance to be just as inspired by women's accomplishments as men's. We establish and operate museums, not just as some kind of giant drawer in which to store our memorabilia, but as way to celebrate our accomplishments, affirm our shared values and preserve the full and accurate story of our common history. And unfortunately, only half of that story is presently being told. The stories of courageous and pioneering Americans such as abolitionist Harriet Tubman, astronaut Sally Ride, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and the founder of the Girl Scouts, Juliette Gordon Low, will inform and inspire future generations. The remarkable women who helped to make this country what it is today deserve to have their histories told and preserved for the ages. Their stories of success are the stories that will inspire and encourage millions of women. Our daughters and our sons deserve the chance to learn the story -- the full story -- of how this amazing country came to be. And by the way, the movie star inventor? That was Hedy Lamarr. The 16 year-old who rode farther than Paul Revere was Sybil Ludington. And the spy, code named ""355""? Well, we still don't know the name -- but we know the patriot was a ""she.""

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot told a judge and prosecutor Tuesday that he would prefer to finish serving a 28-year murder sentence in Peru rather than be extradited to the United States to face charges related to the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, his Peruvian lawyer said. Representatives from the U.S. Embassy and the FBI attended the extradition hearing, which was not open to the public, Maximo Altez told InSession on Tru TV. A conviction in the United States could affect van der Sloot's chances of being paroled in Peru, said Altez. He noted that a long-standing extradition treaty between the two countries means that van der Sloot will likely be extradited, despite his stated preference about remaining in Peru. Peruvian judges in January sentenced the Dutchman to 28 years in prison for the murder in 2010 of Stephany Flores. He is also the prime suspect in the disappearance of Holloway. U.S. authorities want to try van der Sloot on charges of extortion and wire fraud in the Holloway case. ""I think he will be extradited within the next three months,"" Altez said last month. ""He will go to trial in the United States. Once he is sentenced, he will return to Peru to finish serving his 28 years, and then go back to the States to serve whatever sentence he gets there."" In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him after allegations that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament. If found guilty of extortion, he could be sentenced to 25 years in prison. Van der Sloot admitted to killing Flores, 21, in his Lima hotel room. The judges gave him a sentence two years short of the 30-year maximum. They ordered he be expelled from Peru at the end of his sentence and required him to pay about $74,500 in reparations to Flores' relatives. Van der Sloot confessed to robbery in addition to murder, admitting that he stole Flores' belongings, including more than $300 in local currency, credit cards and the victim's van as a means to leave the country. He fled to Chile and was arrested a few days later. Another van der Sloot attorney, Jose Luis Jimenez, has said that his client was under special stress the day of the 2010 murder, which marked five years after Holloway, an 18-year-old from Alabama, disappeared while vacationing on Aruba. Van der Sloot, who was among the last people reported to have been seen with Holloway, was detained twice but never charged in the case. ""The world had been against him for five years before this case, for a murder he said he never committed and for which there is no evidence whatsoever,"" Jimenez has said. Investigators have said they believe van der Sloot killed Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on his computer while visiting him in his hotel room. The two met while van der Sloot was in town for the poker tournament. Judges described how Flores hit van der Sloot in the face after reading the item on Holloway, leading him to hit her in the face with his elbow. Flores fainted and van der Sloot tried to strangle her, but she was still breathing, so he suffocated her with his shirt. Van der Sloot then tried to clean the room by removing the sheets and changing his bloodied shirt, they said. He was caught in a taxi near the Chilean central coastal city of Vina del Mar. Holloway's body has not been found, and no one has been charged in relation to the case in Aruba. About 6Â½ years after Holloway was last reported seen, in May 2005, she was declared legally dead.","Dutchman says he'd rather finish serving sentence in Peru, lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- India may be turning the world's hottest chili into a weapon, but there are people who actually want to eat the ghost chili -- the bhut jolokia or naga jolokia -- for fun. ""As soon as something is declared and proven to be the hottest chili pepper in the world, everybody wants to grow it,"" said Dave DeWitt, the author of more than 35 books on chilis, including ""The Complete Chile Pepper Book."" ""So they can take people out in their yard and say, 'That is the hottest chili pepper in the world. Do you dare eat it?' "" A small but dedicated group of chili pepper lovers fosters its devotion to heat on Web sites and at festivals nationwide. They gather at annual events such as the Chile Pepper Food Festival in Bowers, Pennsylvania, an autumn affair that features a pepper-eating contest, naturally, but also a song contest and excursions into the fields where fans can see how their favorite peppers are grown. In their homes, fans congregate for ""hotlucks,"" the traditional potluck with exponentially higher heat. Mark Stevens of Monmouth County, New Jersey, is among these self-proclaimed ""chili-heads."" ""The main issue is flavor,"" Stevens said. ""It's not a pissing contest to see who can eat the hottest thing, which is usually what you see when the media reports on the stuff."" Once an eater gets used to the heat, he or she begins to appreciate the flavor differences of each varietal, Stevens says. ""You basically build up a tolerance to the heat and then can taste all the flavors that are underneath it, so that what was just basically flavorless blazing heat, after a while, you can actually taste the different flavors in different chilis in different foods,"" he said. Stevens says he began eating chilis in the early 1990s when he needed to lose weight. ""I wanted something that I could snack on that was pretty low-calorie but definitely let me know that I had eaten something, and chilis kind of fit the bill."" Dave Hirschkop has been selling hot sauces for 17 years through his company, Dave's Gourmet, and says it's the hottest sauces that are his best sellers. ""There are a lot of people that just want to challenge themselves,"" Hirschkop said. ""They want to see what the hottest thing in the world is, either because they're daredevils or because their heat tolerance is amazingly high and to get that reaction they like, they need something that's super strong."" Hirschkop sells two sauces made with the ghost chili, a pepper so hot it rates about 1 million on the Scoville unit system. Tabasco comes in at around 5,000. The Indian government said last month that it planned to use the ghost pepper in a tear gas-like hand grenade aimed at fighting terrorists or rioters. Making a weapon is ""probably one of the best things you can do with them,"" DeWitt said. The peppers get their heat from capsaicin, a chemical that the plants have developed to keep mammals from eating them (mammals destroy the seeds in the digestion process). Birds, which can eat the peppers and pass the seeds through their system, are immune to the heat of capsaicin. The people who really like to eat the super-hot chilis probably don't have as many capsaicin receptors in their mouths, DeWitt says. It's the fiery reaction that Dave's Gourmet customers are searching for. Hirschkop puts the ghost chili in one of his ""Insanity"" sauces as well as in a limited-edition hot sauce he sells in a wooden coffin tied shut with caution tape. ""This one has a great flavor but is the hottest in the world; that's the bottom line, right?"" he said. ""People aren't talking about some cascabel [chili] or some other variety with that enthusiasm.""","Chili pepper lovers foster devotion to heat on Web sites, at festivals nationwide .

"(CNN) -- Double world champion Sebastian Vettel insists Red Bull can continue to dominate Formula One as the leading marque unveiled their car for the 2012 season on Monday. German driver Vettel has been unrivaled over the last two years, winning 16 races since the start of 2010 to become the sport's youngest two-time drivers' champion. The 24-year-old's peerless form -- which earned him 11 grand prix wins in 2011 -- has also helped Red Bull clinch back-to-back constructors' titles. Speaking at the launch of the new RB8, Vettel set his sights on securing a third successive Red Bull clean sweep. Alonso eyes glory as Ferrari unveil radical new design . ""We had a great year,"" Vettel told the sport's official website. ""I think we'll always look back to 2011 and think how special it was. ""We know how special it was and we really enjoyed that but we know how hard it is to be that consistent, always there and nearly every race on the podium. ""So the target is to obviously try to do it again and try to get everything out of ourselves, so we'll see how we get on with the new car, the RB8."" Despite the success of the Austrian-owned, UK-based team -- who entered the elite division of motorsport as recently as 2005 -- Vettel warned against complacency ahead of the new season, which starts in Australia on March 18. ""At the beginning of last year we didn't really expect whatever happened last year, so I think it's the same thing again. ""It would be wrong to go into this season and expect 2011 to happen again ... I think it will be very, very tight this year and anything else would be a surprise to be honest."" New car gives McLaren confidence to end Red Bull dominance . Vettel's Australian teammate Mark Webber endured a frustrating 2011, securing his first and only win of the year at the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix on his way to a third-place finish in the drivers' standings -- 134 points behind Vettel. ""Last year wasn't an amazing season, but it wasn't too bad for me,"" the 35-year-old said. ""I still managed to finish third in the drivers' championship ... so it was a great way for me to finish the year with the victory in Brazil and many strong results. ""We're always learning as athletes and I'm looking forward to 2012, it's got some great opportunities for me. You know the old cliche, take each race as it comes, but that's how it will be initially and we'll go from there."" Another veteran on the grid next year will be Finland's Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, who is returning to the sport after a two-season absence. The former Ferrari driver has joined Lotus -- who competed in last year's championship as Renault -- and spoke of his excitement at the launch of the team's new E20 car. ""Formula One is something very special in my racing career,"" said the 32-year-old, who participated in NASCAR and the World Rally Championship in his break from F1. ""You always want to race at the toughest level, so Formula One is where you want to race if you have a choice. ""I think we'll have a lot of fun in the season ahead and hopefully we will get some good results. I want a strong enough car to challenge for good results."" Swiss team Sauber also showcased their new car on Monday, with Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi and Mexico's Sergio Perez on hand to take the C31 for a spin. Kobayashi finished last season in 12th place, four positions and 16 points ahead of Perez, and he is looking forward to his third year with the team. ""We've been through a lot together and can benefit from our shared experiences,"" Kobayashi said. ""In my first year with the team we had a bad start but a good second half to the season. ""The second year was the exact reverse. In our third year together we should be a reliable bet to finish consistently in the points.

"(CNN) -- For once we have good news on the obesity front, and it's in an area where we need it most -- our children. The recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a 43% drop in the obesity rate among children of preschool age over the past decade. Obesity rates drop for 2- to 5-year-olds . I will leave it to others to do the number crunching and parse the details of how this data was collected and analyzed, but I will say as a longtime warrior against obesity and unhealthy living these developments are welcome indeed. There has been no single effort that has brought about this dramatic decline -- if indeed it is as reported. Yes, the first lady's office and the Let's Move campaign deserve some credit for encouraging young people to become more active. (Full disclosure, as a member of the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, I have worked with the campaign spreading the gospel of what regular activity and good nutrition can do for our youth and families.) But there are thousands of organizations across the country, whether large advocacy groups or small church clubs, that have pulled out every trick in the bag to get children playing, exercising and spending less time in front of video games and TV programs. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested, from major corporations to professional sporting leagues such as the NFL and its Play 60, to try to get the message across -- and it seems like it's working. But let's not start the happy dance just yet. Nutrition labels getting a makeover . There is still a tremendously rugged and intimidating mountain in our path. Getting our children to move is just half the battle, but the other half -- nutrition -- is equally important. The state of the country's nutritional offerings at school is nothing less than embarrassing. Having visited a Chicago public school recently to see what was being served in the cafeteria made me think that most overly groomed Shih Tzus on Park Avenue are eating better than millions of children sitting down to fried, high-calorie, low-nutritious foods that in some ways are barely recognizable with their descriptions on the menus. When are we going to wake up as a country and realize you can't expect young, fertile minds and growing bodies to perform at maximum capacity when we are pouring high-fructose corn syrup and other toxic chemicals down their mouths? When are more government and school officials going to show the courage of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and make broad, drastic changes in not just food content but food accessibility? First lady: Childhood obesity is about fitness, not looks . We need not just to teach our children how to make smart choices, but we also need not to tempt them with the ones we already know are bad and harmful. It's a major problem that's going to take major action, not major lip service. Why should schools even be allowed to serve soda and these sweet teas and other drinks that have more sugar in one serving than what should be consumed for an entire week? For many of our young, a school meal will be the only and most nutritionally balanced meal they will consume all day, and that meal in most cases is still substandard. It's time for a dramatic, out-of-the-box, take-no-prisoners overhaul. People who have no financial or political interest in what crosses the lunch table need to be at the real table deciding how to fix this mess that our country has slowly devolved into over the last couple of decades. School boards and vendor contracts and kickbacks and all other means of self-gain have tainted the system for far too long, and now the waistlines and blood sugar levels of our children are showing it. Kudos to the experts, families, schools and organizations that have been sounding the alarm for a long time and have been trying in their own way to make a difference. Kudos to the news media, which typically get this story right and give it the coverage it deserves. But before we get too excited and start high-fiving about this recent CDC report, let's take a closer look at the real problems. Let's challenge ourselves to think smarter and more courageously. Let's do what it takes to ensure this new finding isn't just an odd plot on the graph but a new normal. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Juana Vidal yearns to reunite with her undocumented immigrant son and his family, but she fears the stakes involved. Her son, Elesban Vidal, his wife and their two daughters will join as many as 125 families that will try to cross the California-Mexico border on Monday and demand that U.S. officials allow them back in the country to join with their U.S. relatives through a humanitarian visa or asylum. Most, if not all, of the 125 families had earlier lived in the United States as undocumented immigrants, including some who were earlier deported. The dramatic maneuver by so many families is designed to renew attention to how the U.S. immigration system painfully breaks up families when members are deported for being undocumented immigrants. The families will stage their event on the Mexico side of the Otay Mesa point of entry, between San Diego and Tijuana. ""I'm very worried. I'm nervous. I sometimes can't sleep because I'm thinking something could happen to them,"" Juana Vidal said. That's the feeling Juana Vidal has had since she found out a few weeks ago that her son and his family will be attempting to return from Puebla, Mexico, where they have been living the past two years. ""He's afraid but says he will try to see if he's able to come back,"" Juana Vidal, 56, said in an interview in her Los Angeles home. She spends her time caring for her other U.S.-born grandchildren. She will anxiously wait on the U.S. side of the Otay Mesa crossing to see if her son and his family will be admitted. Her son and his wife had been living in the United States as undocumented immigrants, but they were never arrested and voluntarily returned to Mexico after he couldn't find a decent job. Their two daughters, however, were born in the United States and are American citizens, and the Vidal family hopes the citizen status of the two girls, ages 3 and 5, will help their visa applications so that grandparents can be reunited with grandchildren and their parents. Elesban Vidal also wants to unite his family with his siblings, who live in the United States. The family won't find Monday's quest easy, experts say. The event is part of the ""Bring them Home"" campaign led by the National Immigrant Youth Alliance (NIYA), which calls itself ""an undocumented youth-led network"" of groups that tries to reunite families. ""It's incredible that we have to rely on actions like this,"" said Luis Nolasco, a member of NIYA. ""There are so many families that want a way to come back. The reality should be that they should be able to come back an easier way and it's not happening,"" Nolasco says everyday hundreds of families are being separated under President Barack Obama's administration. Almost 2 million undocumented immigrants have been deported since the President took office five years ago, he said. Monday's action will be the third and largest event staged so far by the alliance. Deportations: Missing parents, scared kids . ""What happens is people will present themselves at the border and will be asked to be let back into the country because this is their home for lot of them,"" Nolsaco said. Immigrants who have not been able to obtain a visa for entry can apply for an alternative visa known as humanitarian parole, according to the Department of Homeland Security website. These types of visas allow foreign residents to come into the country based on their particular situation. However, immigration lawyers say humanitarian parole isn't an easy document to obtain and that it's granted case-by-case. ""It's a benefit that's given to individuals that want to come to the United States, generally for emergency reasons. It's applied either with United States Citizenship Immigration Services or with U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the Border,"" said Nelson Castillo, a California-based immigration lawyer. Castillo said humanitarian parole is granted to those with true emergency or medical situations where they have to explain to an officer at the border why they want to be received by the United States. ""Generally they have to prove that they have tried to obtain a way to come in lawfully into the United States and they will have to plead out their case to what is the valid reason, the emergency,"" Castillo said. Long-lost son, 37, to finally see mother after 35 years abroad . The National Immigrant Youth Alliance says these families have the right to come back to this country, as many have children who are U.S. citizens. ""They lived here, they grew up here, and studied here. This is their community and this is their home and they don't recognize Mexico as their home country. Just because they were born there doesn't mean it's their home,"" said Nolasco. The alliance's other two efforts to reunite families involved nine young adults and 30 young adults -- all of them who once lived in the United States as undocumented immigrants but had left the country for one reason or another, including through deportation. Those two groups used the current political coinage of ""Dreamers"" to describe themselves -- that is, young immigrants in the United States without documentation. Dreamer is a moniker taken after an acronym of immigration reform legislation. ""The first run had nine Dreamers, second round had 30 and this time we are including families and parents in this round,"" Nolasco said. In the first two rounds, U.S. immigration officials detained all the participants and then released them, the alliance said. The majority obtained approval to stay temporarily in the United States and are awaiting for their day before an immigration judge, who will determine their fate. The Vidal family is nervous about the alliance's latest effort. Elesban Vidal, 32, was undocumented, like his parents, when they brought him to the United States at age 6. The family lived in Southern California near Compton, where Juana Vidal raised all five of her children. They attended Los Angeles schools and consider the United States their home country. But Juana Vidal said Elesban returned to Mexico two years ago because he couldn't find a job and he thought he could find more opportunity in Mexico. That didn't happen, the mother said. Her son didn't qualify for the Obama initiative called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program because he didn't meet all the requirements that would have allowed him temporary permission to remain in the states, the mother said. ""He told me the situation is hard, very hard"" in Mexico, Juana Vidal said. ""He can't get ahead, sometimes there's days he has a job and there's other days he doesn't and he tries to get by. But he regrets he left."" A tale of two Republicans: A story of the GOP and immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- Back in the mid-1960s, a Palestinian guerrilla group called Fatah -- the Conquest -- began launching cross-border attacks against Israeli civilians. Sponsored by Syria and led by Palestinian activists, among them the young Mahmoud Abbas, Fatah aroused admiration throughout the Arab world. So much so that Egypt, then Syria's rival, formed its own group and called it the Palestine Liberation Organization -- the PLO -- which also staged attacks into Israel. The Israelis wouldn't sit passively, though, but struck back at Fatah's Syrian hosts, who in turn shelled Israeli villages. Not to be outdone, Egypt in May 1967 evicted U.N. peacekeeping forces from the Sinai Peninsula and amassed troops along Israel's border. This precipitated an Israeli pre-emptive strike against Egypt which, within hours, ensnarled Syria and even Jordan. Six days later, Israeli troops controlled the territories, whose final status remains bitterly unresolved. Recalling the background to the Six-Day War -- a conflict almost nobody wanted and even fewer anticipated -- is crucial today in the face of a frightfully similar process unfolding along Israel's southern border. If left unchecked, the rising violence in Gaza could quickly spiral uncontrollably. Another conflagration, no more desired or foreseen than that of 1967, could once again engulf the Middle East. Though Fatah and the PLO merged long ago and are now headed by Mahmoud Abbas, who has since forsworn terror, other Palestinian groups are vying for power. By attacking Israel, they gain credibility in the Palestinian street and prestige throughout the region. One such group was Hamas, a wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, that violently expelled Abbas' men from Gaza in 2007 and proceeded to fire thousands of rockets at Israel. Still not passive, Israel retaliated with punishing operations in Gaza in 2008 and 2012. Those blows, together with the Brotherhood's fall from power in Egypt, subdued Hamas, but now another Gaza organization has risen to challenge it. Islamic Jihad has been firing rockets and aiming ground attacks at Israel. Characteristically, the Israelis responded with force and earlier this week killed three Islamic Jihad operatives engaged in mounting a strike. The terrorists then fired some 50 rockets and mortar shells at southern Israeli towns, spurring Israeli fighter jets to bomb 29 targets in Gaza. (An Islamic Jihad leader told CNN on Thursday a truce had been declared, but the Israeli government has not commented.) But Israel regards Hamas as the sovereign authority in Gaza and holds it ultimately responsible for any attacks emanating from there, even those conducted by Islamic Jihad. If the rocket fire and shelling continue, Israel is likely to retaliate against Hamas, which could be dragged, however unwillingly, into the fighting. Islamic Jihad is funded and armed by Iran. Just last week, Israeli naval commandos intercepted a cargo ship -- the Klos-C -- carrying 400,000 bullets and 40 rockets capable of hitting Tel Aviv. Made in Iran, the arms would have enabled Islamic Jihad to join with Hezbollah, Iran's chief proxy in Lebanon, to rocket every Israeli city. The goal is to deter Israel from striking Iran's nuclear facilities and to paralyze it with multiple existential threats. But what if Iran -- much like Egypt in 1967 -- miscalculated? What could happen if an Israeli reprisal for Islamic Jihad's rockets results in a confrontation between Israel and Hamas? Would Hezbollah then join the clash, unleashing its arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets against the Jewish state, and would Israeli forces have to invade Lebanon to stop them? Would Iran watch idly while its closest Middle East ally was crushed by the ""Zionist enemy,"" or would it, too, leap into the fray? Gaza remains a combat zone as of this writing, and rocket alert sirens are wailing in southern Israeli cities.

"Editor's note: Tony Newman is the director of media relations at the Drug Policy Alliance Network. Tony Newman says cigarettes kill more people than drugs that are illegal. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Cigarettes kill; 400,000 people die prematurely every year from smoking. When we analyze the harm from drugs, there is no doubt that cigarettes are the worst. They kill more people than cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and all other illegal drugs combined. More than 800,000 people are arrested every year for marijuana, the vast majority for possession, yet all the data from studies that compare the two substances show that cigarettes are more harmful to an individual's health. If we make these other drugs illegal, shouldn't we outlaw the leading killer? Considering how we deal with less harmful drugs, making cigarettes illegal seems logical. Over the past decade, we have seen, in states from California to New York, increasing restrictions on when and where people can smoke -- and even momentum toward tobacco prohibition. Smoking is banned in bars and restaurants and on some university campuses. People can now be fired from their jobs because they can't give up smoking. We have seen parents denied adoption rights if they smoke. In some cities, it is nearly impossible to smoke anywhere besides your own home. The Drug Policy Alliance sponsored a Zogby Poll in 2006, and we were shocked to find that 45 percent of those polled supported making cigarettes illegal within the next 10 years. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, it's more than 50 percent. But with all of the good intentions in the world, outlawing cigarettes would be just as disastrous as the prohibition on other drugs. After all, people would still smoke, just as they still use other drugs that are prohibited, from marijuana to cocaine. But now, in addition to the harm of smoking, we would find a whole range of ""collateral consequences"" that come along with prohibition. A huge number of people who smoke would continue to do so, but now they would be considered criminals. We would have parents promising their kids that they will stop smoking but still sneaking a smoke. We would have smokers hiding their habit and smoking in alleys and dark corners, afraid of being caught using the illegal substance. We would have cops using precious time and resources to hassle and arrest cigarette smokers. Our prison overcrowding crisis would rise to an unprecedented level with ""addicts"" and casual cigarette smokers alike getting locked up. We would have a black market, with outlaws taking the place of delis and supermarkets and stepping in to meet the demand and provide the desired drug. Instead of buying your cigarettes in a legally sanctioned place, you would have to hit the streets to pick up your fix. The cigarette trade would provide big revenue to ""drug dealers,"" just as illegal drugs do today. There would be shootouts in the streets and killings over the right to sell the prohibited tobacco plant. We have tried prohibiting cigarettes in some state prisons, like in California, and we have seen that smoking continues, with cigarettes traded illicitly. There is a violent black market that fills the void and leads to unnecessary deaths over access and the inflated profits. Luckily, no one is proposing making cigarettes illegal. On the contrary, our public health campaign around cigarettes has been a model of success compared with our results with other prohibited drugs. By placing high taxes on cigarettes, restricting locations where one can smoke and banning certain kinds of advertising, we have seen a significant decline in the number of people who smoke. Instead of giving teens ""reefer madness""-style propaganda, we have treated young people with respect and given them honest education about the harm of cigarettes, and we have been rewarded with fewer young people smoking today than ever before. Although we should celebrate our success and continue to encourage people to cut back or give up smoking, let's not get carried away and think that prohibition would eliminate smoking. We need to realize that drugs, from cigarettes to marijuana to alcohol, will always be consumed, whether they are legal or illegal. Although drugs have health consequences and dangers, making them illegal -- and keeping them illegal -- will only bring additional death and suffering. Don't just take my word for it. Take it from the news anchor  who was called the most trusted man in America, Walter Cronkite. Here is what he said about prohibition and our war on drugs: ""I covered the Vietnam War. I remember the lies that were told, the lives that were lost -- and the shock when, 20 years after the war ended, former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara admitted he knew it was a mistake all along. ... ""And I cannot help but wonder how many more lives, and how much more money, will be wasted before another Robert McNamara admits what is plain for all to see: The war on drugs is a failure.""

"(CNN) -- An anti-drone activist and journalist from Pakistan has been released, more than a week after he was abducted from his home in Rawalpindi. Kareem Khan told reporters Friday how he was abducted by armed men who showed up at his family's home in the early hours of February 5, and then tortured him while he was in captivity. Khan, from the tribal area of North Waziristan, lost his son and brother to a 2009 CIA drone strike, and had been set to travel to Europe to meet with parliamentarians when he disappeared, lawyer Shazad Akbar said in a news release. He was also involved in legal proceedings against the Pakistani police concerning their failure to investigate the killing of his relatives. At a news conference held only hours after he was freed, Khan told how between 18 and 20 armed men kidnapped him from his home. ""The men banged at our house door, broke the lock and barged in,"" he said. ""They held guns to me and my family and told us to put our hands up. Took me to a car, handcuffed me, blindfolded me and drove off. ""My eyes still hurt from the tightness of the blindfold. My temples, eyes and forehead are all in pain because of how tight the blindfold was. My feet were constantly shackled and my feet were constantly handcuffed."" 'Hung upside down' Khan said he was not able to pinpoint where he was taken, nor who his abductors were. The scene of his torture was an underground room, he said. ""They abused me using vulgar expletives. Hung me upside down and sat on me while one other person beat my feet,"" he said. He could hear other people while he was in the torture cell, he said. Khan said his questioners ""didn't mention drones, didn't mention my family. Only asked me about some names I couldn't recognize and what connection I had to them. ""I could not tell if my captors were from the intelligence agencies, they were from all ethnicities and did not give away anything that could identify them."" Khan said he had been told not to speak to the media but that he was unafraid. ""I brought my children to the city of Rawalpindi from Waziristan to provide safety to them but now we don't feel safe anywhere,"" he said. ""I am going to Europe to highlight how my people are being abused by drone strikes. Our brothers and children are peaceful citizens who are being targeted. We are not terrorists that are being killed."" Charity: Serious questions to answer . Reprieve, a UK-based charity that provides legal support to prisoners unable to pay for it themselves, said Khan intends still to go ahead with his trip to Europe this week. He was due to speak with German, Dutch and British parliamentarians about his personal experience of drone strikes. Reprieve legal director Kat Craig said it was a ""huge relief"" that Khan had been freed, although his mistreatment was deeply concerning. ""No one should have to suffer as he and his family have done for simply trying to get to the truth about the deaths of their loved ones,"" she said. ""Serious questions remain for the Pakistani government on how this was allowed to happen."" Khan spoke to CNN in December 2010 about the airstrike a year earlier that had targeted his home in Machikhel, a village in North Waziristan. Khan said the missiles killed his 35-year-old brother, a teacher with a master's degree in English literature; his 18-year-old son, and several others. He filed a $500 million lawsuit against the U.S. government. CNN's Chandrika Narayan and Saleem Mehsud contributed to this report.","Anti-drone activist and journalist Kareem Khan is freed, nine days after his abduction .

"(CNN) -- A month of conflict has displaced about 413,000 people in South Sudan, the United Nations said Wednesday, after a major surge in the number of people fleeing violence in the past week. Representatives of the government and rebels have been holding talks in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but fighting continues to wrack the world's newest country. Hundreds of people have been wounded and thousands displaced by heavy fighting over the past few days, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said Wednesday. The group, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said its teams had treated 116 people suffering from gunshot wounds in the towns of Malakal and Nasir in Upper Nile state amid clashes there and elsewhere. The violence has also forced about 78,000 to flee to neighboring countries, the United Nations said, on top of the hundreds of thousands displaced within South Sudan's borders. Many are women and children. More than 42,000 people are now in Uganda's West Nile region, according to the United Nations' refugee agency, the UNHCR, while about 18,600 have sought refuge in Ethiopia. Nearly 6,800 people from Jonglei have fled to Kenya, many of them children. And an estimated 10,000 have fled into Sudan's volatile West Kordofan and South Kordofan states. The U.N. refugee agency warned Tuesday that with fighting still reported in parts of South Sudan, particularly Jonglei and Upper Nile states, it expects more displacement both within and beyond its borders. The exodus has been fueled by the fighting and people's fears, combined with worsening living conditions and a lack of food in some places, UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland. Many South Sudanese men are taking their families to the Ugandan border and leaving them there before returning to their country, he said. ""From the refugees we have spoken to, we are hearing eyewitness accounts of killings, houses being burnt and shooting,"" Edwards said. Within South Sudan, about 65,000 people have sought sanctuary at U.N. bases. The country erupted into violence on December 15, when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup. Since then, militia members loyal to Machar have battled government forces loyal to President Salva Kiir. Malta foreign minister: Country 'cannot offer' migrants opportunities . Fleeing families drown . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has condemned anti- and pro-government forces for stealing food and vehicles used by the humanitarian community. In a statement issued on Tuesday, his spokesperson said Ban was ""alarmed by the rising number of fatalities resulting from the continuing fighting in South Sudan"" and reiterated those responsible for attacks against civilians, humanitarian workers and UN personnel will be held to account. The U.N. Mission in South Sudan reported heavy fighting Tuesday between pro- and anti-government forces in Malakal, in Upper Nile state in the northeast of the country. Stray shots injured dozens of displaced people who'd sought refuge at a nearby U.N. base, the mission said. MSF said the medical needs of the displaced are placing existing health facilities under increasing pressure, with some clinics and hospitals already overwhelmed. The group added it was reinforcing emergency teams to deal with the rising health and humanitarian needs. ""While we continue to treat more wounded patients in our hospitals every day, we are also concerned about the living conditions of the hundreds of thousands of displaced people across the country, most of whom fled their homes with nothing and have little food, water, or access to health care,"" Raphael Gorgeu, MSF head of mission in South Sudan, said in a statement. ""The fighting in Malakal over the past few days has limited our ability to reach displaced people where they are gathering, preventing people from receiving the medical and humanitarian assistance they desperately need."" Between 200 and 300 women and children who were fleeing fighting drowned when an overloaded ferry overturned on a river near Malakal over the weekend, an army spokesman said. On Tuesday, Ghana said it was preparing to send 850 troops to join a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization appealed this week for $61 million to help it provide food assistance to those in need. Even before the violence broke out last month, about 4.4 million people were expected to face food insecurity this year, an agency news release said. Now, many more are at risk of hunger. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war.

"(CNN) -- On Monday afternoon, something called Kidz Bop was trending on Twitter. I had never heard of it, but was instantly amused by the word ""Bop."" You see, when I was a kid, Nana lived with us at home in Arizona and she used to wield a giant cardboard wrapping paper roll that we affectionately called her Bopper. When our Great Dane, Shane, would annoy her, she'd promptly try to beat the crap out of him. And he loved it. But Kidz Bop appeared to be far less amusing than Nana's cardboard bludgeoning stick. As one Twitterererer put it: ""Kidz Bop can go die in a hole."" Whatever this Kidz Bop was people weren't happy, and I quickly pieced together from the cascade of angry tweets that it was a compilation children's music series that had just aired a rather annoying commercial on Nickelodeon for its new upcoming release, ""Kidz Bop 22."" Which suggests, perhaps, that somewhere in America there's a parent who owns the other 21 disks and is slowly being talked off a ledge. ""Ma'am, it's going to be OK. We brought you some Zeppelin."" The Kidz Bop people tout their CDs as ""today's biggest hits sung by kids for kids,"" and this particular volume contains remakes of 16 pop songs that I've absolutely never heard. Sure, you may say I'm old and unhip and completely out of touch, but, really, I just spend a lot of time watching ""Matlock."" Anyway, one song in particular on the new album that seemed to be immediately tugging at the gag reflex of most people on Twitter was the Kidz Bop remake of ""Call Me Maybe"" by Carly Rae Jepsen who, in 2007, finished third on ""Canadian Idol."" Which is exactly the same as ""American Idol,"" except all the contestants have to sing while riding a moose. The chorus of Jepsen's song goes: ""Hey, I just met you. And this is crazy. But here's my number. So call me, maybe."" Moral: ""Hey kids ... talk to strangers!"" Now, while I totally understand people finding this song annoying, especially sung by children, I have to admit that, sadly, it's also catchy as hell. And much better than my standard pickup line: ""So, you ride Greyhound often?"" A while back, Justin Bieber actually praised ""Call Me Maybe"" on Twitter, which instantly made it popular, spawning video lip dub remakes by everyone from Katy Perry to the Harvard baseball team. And now it's immortalized on ""Kidz Bop 22."" You're welcome. The Kidz Bop music series is targeted to children aged 5 to 12, and, according to its website, has sold more than 11 million CDs. But I was curious as to just how ""safe"" they were making these songs. Thus, I went all the way back to the beginning, the original Kidz Bop, and decided to examine their remake of Ricky Martin's ""Livin' La Vida Loca."" I figured it would be a good test subject since, so far as I can tell, the song is basically about being drugged and taken advantage of by a sexy Latin hooker. Which, coincidentally, is also No. 32 on my bucket list. So, I purchased the Kidz Bop version off iTunes and found that, at least for this one song, not a single lyric had been changed: . ""Woke up in New York City in a funky cheap hotel/ . She took my heart and she took my money/ . She must've slipped me a sleepin' pill."" See? This is why I have a dog. Because I have no idea how to explain ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" to a child. ""Look, sweetheart, it's complicated. So your mom and I rented you ""Deuce Bigalow."" Close enough. Hey, at least I actually know ""Livin' La Vida Loca."" At the moment, all of my co-workers are making fun of me for just now learning about ""Call Me Maybe."" And I couldn't be more proud. So, if you need me, I'll be at my desk listening to Zeppelin. Or maybe watching ""Matlock.""","In this week's ""Apparently This Matters,"" Jarrett Bellini takes on Kidz Bop .

"(CNN) -- Steven Gerrard scored a 90th minute penalty to grab a precious 3-2 win for Liverpool against Fulham on Wednesday as Brendan Rodgers' side moved to within four points of the English Premier League leaders Chelsea. Following Jose Mourinho's side disappointing 1-1 draw at lowly West Bromwich Albion on Tuesday, Liverpool came from behind twice to complete a dramatic and potentially vital win at Craven Cottage. Kolo Toure, who gifted West Brom an equalizer at the Hawthorns earlier this month, scored an own goal in the eighth minute to hand the home side a boost following their 2-2 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday. Daniel Sturridge equalized for the Reds four minutes before the break only for Kieran Richardson to put Rene Meulensteen's side ahead again in the 63rd minute after some slack defending. The Merseysider's responded with a goal nine minutes later as Philippe Coutinho's 20-yeard shot found its way past goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. The Dutch keeper was replaced by David Stockdale a few minutes later following a collision with Luis Suarez. And it was the English keeper who had to face Gerrard's spot kick after Sturridge was brought down by German defender Sascha Riether. The veteran midfielder fired home to complete only Liverpool's fifth away win of the season which, following a 5-1 demolition of Arsenal at the weekend, takes Rodgers' side up to 53 points and four points off top spot. Fulham remain bottom with 20 points. ""Steven Gerrard is peerless in situations like that,"" Rodgers said. ""He showed brilliant composure. It was a great result. We've had to show character to come from behind twice. ""We're going to keep pushing. We're chasing, other teams are still ahead of us. We need some of them to drop points."" Arsenal attempts to return to the top were thwarted by Manchester United in a 0-0 stalemate at the Emirates. The result, which helps neither side massively, sees the North Londoner's stay one point behind Chelsea while United remain in seventh with 42 points. While Arsenal dominated possession, it was United who probably had the best chances to win the game. But goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny denied the away side with some fine saves, notably from former Gunners striker Robin van Persie at the beginning and towards the end of the game. ""We tried tonight to win it but we got a point,"" Moyes said. ""I'd have liked all three but if you'd have said to me at the start of the season that we'd get four points off Arsenal then I'd say that's not that bad."" There was some cheer off the pitch for United today as they reported an 11.6% rise in revenues to Â£122.9 million ($204 million) in the last three months of 2013 despite some below par performances this season. Elsewhere, Tottenham Hotspur consolidated fifth place with a 4-0 thumping of Newcastle United at St James' Park. Alan Pardew's side's third consecutive league defeat sees them slip further out of contention for a Europa League place next season, but with 37 points the Magpies are still nine points clear of 10th place Swansea City who drew 1-1 with Stoke City. The UK's recent appalling weather put paid to two Premier League fixtures Wednesday, with third-place Manchester City's game against Sunderland and Crystal Palace's trip to Everton both being postponed. Barcelona through to Copa del Rey final . Meanwhile in Spain, Barcelona completed a 3-1 aggregate win over Real Sociedad to reach the final of the Copa del Rey. The Catalans took a 2-0 advantage into the semifinal second leg and when Lionel Messi made it 1-0 on the night (3-0 on aggregate) in the 27th minute the contest was all but killed off. Antoine Griezmann scored an equalizer for the home side in the 87th minute to make it 1-1 on the night.

"(CNN) -- The number of shark attacks last year dropped to a four-year low, but they were deadlier, a University of Florida report says. Worldwide, 10 people died in 72 shark attacks last year. That's higher than the average of 6.3 deaths over the past 10 years, said George Burgess, who conducts research on sharks at the University of Florida. The last time shark attacks were this low was 2009 when there were 67. Since 2001, fatal shark attacks have only been higher once -- in 2011 when there were 13. Shark attack hot spots include Western Australia with six deaths in the past four years and Reunion Island in the southwest Indian Ocean with five deaths in three years. Over the past century, shark attacks have been on the increase as more humans have ventured into the water, according to Burgess. ""When sudden increases in shark attacks occur, usually human factors are involved that promote interactions between sharks and people,"" he said. With more people in the ocean, their interactions with sharks have increased. In the United States, there were 47 shark attacks last year, down from a peak of 54 attacks the previous year. Nearly half of those attacks occurred in Florida. The lone U.S. death involved a man fishing from a kayak off the coast of Hawaii. He was dangling his legs in the water when a shark took a bite. ""Sharks have a lot more to fear from us than we do from them,"" Burgess said. ""Statistically, shark attacks are extremely rare, especially considering the number of humans that enter the water each year."" Burgess warned that entering the ocean is a ""wilderness experience,"" just like hiking in the woods where bears or mountain lions might live. ""One-on-one in the ocean, the shark has the advantage,"" he said. ""But, by better understanding where and when it is safe to be in the ocean, we can better avoid those encounters.""","There were 72 unprovoked shark attacks last year .

"Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) -- The shooting death of a music teacher last week has investigators asking whether the crime is connected to two other unsolved killings in Alexandria, Virginia. Ruthanne Lodato, 59, was shot to death when she answered a knock on her front door Thursday morning. Her elderly mother's caretaker was wounded, but survived, police said. ""This is a very stable community of people who know one another, and crime of this sort is unfathomable,"" neighbor Barry Mudd said. The crime scene is in a quiet residential neighborhood, just a mile from the home where Ronald Kirby, a prominent transportation official, was shot and killed in November. The 69-year-old man's slaying is still unsolved. Detectives, including from the FBI and Alexandria Police Department, are looking for possible connections between the Ladato and Kirby killings, as well as to the unsolved shooting death of Nancy Dunning, the wife of a former sheriff, just two miles away in 2003, police said. Although the crimes are spread over a decade, they share similarities. They happened within two miles of each other in the Washington suburb. All three victims were gunned down in their homes with no signs of a forced entry. ""You can't help but think that, but hopefully it's not multiple people,"" Alexandria Mayor William D. Euille said. Police released a sketch of a man they suspect might be Lodato's killer, hoping to generate tips from the community.

"(CNN) -- Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and ex-wife of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, could take the witness stand Wednesday morning to testify in her own defense in her DWI trial stemming from a 2012 traffic accident. Kennedy is facing a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated for allegedly swerving between lanes and careening into a tractor-trailer on a Westchester County, New York, interstate in July of 2012. She drove away from the accident scene despite a shredded tire, and was found collapsed over the steering wheel of her Lexus SUV a short time later, according to testimony. Kennedy has said she swallowed a pill she believed to be her thyroid medication at around 7:30 the morning of the incident, but that she may have mixed up medicine bottles and taken zolpidem, a powerful sleep aid, instead. A blood test confirmed the presence of zolpidem in Kennedy's system, according to trial testimony this week. At the start of her defense case Tuesday, Kennedy watched with a smile as her younger sister Rory Kennedy described their close relationship. ""She's really my best friend,"" said the younger Kennedy on the stand. When asked about her sister's reputation for truthfulness, she said, ""She wrote the book called 'Speak Truth to Power' about her commitment to justice and truth, and that's what she has devoted her life to."" Trial opens with video of sobriety tests, claim of 'sleep driving' A growing group of supporters have sat in the rows behind the defendant throughout the two trial days in Westchester County, including sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, brothers Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Douglas Kennedy, and 85-year-old family matriarch Ethel Kennedy. Earlier Tuesday, jurors heard from Bradley Molloy, a drug-detection specialist with the New York State Police who evaluated Kennedy after the crash. Some three hours after she allegedly failed three roadside sobriety tests, Kennedy passed those same tests with flying colors, testified Molloy. Finding no signs of intoxication, Molloy instead began to suspect that Kennedy's car accident and disoriented state had been the result of a medical condition, he said. Kennedy herself was also worried, and asked that a vial of the blood drawn from her at Northern Westchester Hospital, said Molloy: ""She was concerned and she wanted to know what happened to her."" Kennedy remained at the hospital overnight for observation. During opening statements Monday, Assistant District Attorney Stefanie DeNise said that even if Kennedy, 54, had taken the sleep aid unintentionally, she had a responsibility to pull her vehicle off the road safely when she began to feel its effects. Defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt disputed that argument, saying Kennedy had no time to react. ""The zolpidem kicks in, it shuts her down, she's in a state of 'sleep driving,'"" he said. Tuesday afternoon, jurors watched another member of Kennedy's defense team spar with an expert witness about the effects of the drug. Laboratory director Elizabeth Pratt conceded that zolpidem is ""a very potent, fast-acting hypnotic,"" that begins to hamper cognitive ability and motor skills within 15-45 minutes. Its effect on Kerry Kennedy would have peaked at around 9 a.m., testified Pratt; roughly the time Kennedy failed an initial round of sobriety tests by police after a motorist called 911. Pratt was asked by prosecutor Doreen Lloyd whether zolpidem is a ""knock-out pill,"" and replied that the drug would need time to enter the blood stream and brain before it takes full effect. ""And, prior to the time the drug takes effect, does a person still have brain function? Do they still have decision-making ability?"" asked Lloyd. ""Yes,"" replied Pratt. The trial continues Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.","Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was in an accident in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Landor Sanchez wants to practice medicine again. But instead, he's laboring at an asbestos removal company in upstate New York. For five years, Sanchez was a family medicine doctor in Cuba. He moved to the United States in 2011 with the dream of being a doctor there. Like many immigrants, he had a plan to live with friends to save money and to study for the exam to become medically licensed in the United States. But soon, his money ran out. And Sanchez found himself with less time to study and instead taking any job he could get -- from painting, to fast-food restaurants, to, now, asbestos removal. A doctor, not practicing medicine, in a country that is short of primary care physicians. Sanchez's story is common among Latino immigrant doctors. In Southern California alone, there are an estimated 3,000 medically trained Latino immigrant doctors who aren't practicing medicine. ""We had always wondered, where are the (immigrant) doctors from Latin America?"" says Dr. Patrick Dowling, chairman of UCLA's Department of Family Medicine. ""And we stumbled upon them working in menial jobs."" Instead of treating patients, Dowling says, many doctors spend years cleaning houses or working on construction sites and in fast-food chain restaurants. ""We heard from one woman working at McDonald's in Colorado,"" says Dowling. ""So she is selling fast food to people, and if she were licensed as a physician, she could be educating those same people, those same patients, on what a good diet is."" Latino immigrant doctors have a harder time than other immigrants transitioning into the U.S. health system, according to Dowling. ""Often they work in their own country for 10 years and then come here and they aren't licensed, and then they see how hard the process is and they have to get an odd job to support themselves."" It's a costly, time-consuming process that most immigrants aren't prepared for. From migrant worker to neurosurgeon . That's why Dowling and his colleague, Dr. Michelle Bholat, have developed a program at UCLA that helps fast-track Latino immigrant doctors into the U.S. health care system, the International Medical Graduate program. The IMG program provides test prep classes and clinical observations with UCLA doctors. It also covers the cost of the U.S. medical board exam and provides a monthly stipend. Funded by private donors, the program has helped 66 Latino immigrant doctors pass the board exams and get placed into residency programs in California. In return, the doctors commit to working three years in an underserved area. Dr. Jose Chavez is one of those graduates. He was a doctor in El Salvador with more than eight years of medical training when he moved to the United States in 2005. But prior to last year, he wasn't working in a U.S. hospital -- or any hospital. Instead, he was cleaning houses and installing flooring. ""I would do anything you asked me to as long as it was legal and you paid me for it,"" he says. Chavez says without the help of UCLA's IMG program, he would still be working odd jobs to pay the bills while juggling his time to study for the test at night. ""It requires you study at least 10 hours a day,"" says Chavez. ""Imagine you are working 10 hours a day, and then try to study 10 hours at night. It is really impossible."" The stipend allowed Chavez to stop cleaning homes and focus solely on his studies. He passed the U.S. medical board exam just six months after being accepted into the program. Today, he is a first-year resident at Riverside County Regional Medical Center in California -- a place in desperate need of doctors. Riverside County has just one primary care physician for every 9,000 residents, according to the hospital. ""I personally know at least 20 more (Latino immigrant) doctors who are delivering pizza, and instead they could be working as doctors if they had the help I had,"" say Chavez. And with Obamacare potentially adding 25 million to 30 million people to the health system, the doctor shortage is going to get worse before it gets better. ""When 2014 rolls around, they (Americans) may have an insurance card, but where are they going to get care?"" says Bholat. ""It is not enough to just issue an insurance card."" Your health care is covered, but who's going to treat you? The problem is compounded in California because of the large immigrant population. ""Forty percent of the population here is Hispanic, but only 5% of our doctors are Latino. That is an amazing gap,"" says Bholat. Dowling and Bholat say while their fast-track program may make only a small dent to help the primary care shortage in America, it's a critical start. ""We're getting dozens of applications daily, and we accept as many candidates as we can financially support in the program,"" says Bholat ""We need these doctors in America."" Sanchez has applied to the UCLA IMG program and is waiting to hear if he gets accepted. Until then, he'll continue to work at the asbestos removal company during the day, and study for the U.S. medical boards at night. But he says no matter how long it takes, he won't give up on his dream to practice medicine in the United States.","Latino immigrant doctors are working menial jobs in the United States .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic may have surrendered his No. 1 ranking to Rafael Nadal, but he was not about to tighten his grip on the China Open title. Nadal ended the Serbian's 11-month reign at the top by reaching Sunday's final, but could not stop Djokovic winning in Beijing for the fourth time in five years. ""I needed this win today. I really wanted to get my hands on the trophy and win against Nadal, who has been the best player so far in 2013,"" the 26-year-old said. ""It's very important for my confidence. It's very important mentally and emotionally for me."" Djokovic has yet to taste defeat at the tournament, having not taken part in 2011 due to injury. ""I still haven't lost a match here. I just love the conditions,"" he said. ""I love the court and the atmosphere that goes around the tournament. Center court is exceptional, and I enjoy it. I try to cherish every moment that I spend here every year."" Djokovic is still hoping to be the ATP Tour's year-end No. 1 for the third successive time, but he faces a tough task to displace Nadal -- who has won two grand slams this year after returning from long-term knee problems in February. Nadal had been on a 22-match winning streak since his shock first-round defeat at Wimbledon, and had beaten Djokovic three times in a row including last month's U.S. Open final to take his career advantage to 22-15. ""I didn't see the way to stop him this afternoon,"" the 13-time grand slam champion said. ""He was too strong for me. I didn't play my best match, but he played at a very high level with his serve. ""I was not able to have any chance when I was returning during the whole match. He had the ball staying very low. It was very difficult to create spin on this ball. He was able to hit all the balls where he wanted. When that's happening against a player like Novak, you are dead. You don't have one chance."" Both players will next move on to Shanghai, where Djokovic will be defending his Masters title -- if he cannot then Nadal could take advantage and move further ahead in the standings, having not played there last year. Roger Federer also returns to action, with the former world No. 1 needing points to ensure his participation at the season-ending championships in London next month. Serena Williams, meanwhile, will be taking a break ahead of the WTA Championships in Istanbul, having won the 56th title of her career in Beijing on Sunday and her 10th of this season -- the best tally since Justine Henin in 2007. The world No. 1 crushed formerly top-ranked Jelena Jankovic 6-2 6-2 despite suffering an apparent recurrence of a back problem from earlier in the tournament. She is now seventh on the all-time WTA list, having moved above Virginia Wade and Lindsay Davenport. The American has 73 match wins this year, the best since Kim Clijsters' 90 and Henin's 75 in 2003. ""I really love tennis so much and it's fans like the ones here in China who are so exciting to come to,"" she said after her second success in Beijing -- the other being in 2004 when it moved to Beijing. ""The fans make me want to play, they're so great here, so coming here is such a great opportunity."" Jankovic, the only woman to play in all 10 editions of the event, was unable to repeat her 2008 success. ""Serena was just too good today, and big congratulations to her,"" said the Serbian eighth seed, who is hoping to clinch one of the remaining places for the Turkey showpiece. Last month China's Li Na sealed the fifth of eight spots, joining Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Maria Sharapova and Agnieszka Radwanska in qualifying.","Novak Djokovic retains China Open title, beating Rafael Nadal in Sunday's final .

"(CNN) -- YouTube: It's not just for cute cats anymore. The Web's leading video site is now the home of a new kind of interactive visual journalism, where ""citizen witnesses"" are reaching millions of people with the news of the day, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center. A prime example was the tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011. In the week following the earthquake that caused the deadly wave, the 20 most-watched news videos on YouTube received 96 million views, according to the report. Most of that footage came not from professionals but from users who were in the middle of the disaster that killed more than 18,000 people. ""Citizens are creating their own videos about news and posting them,"" read the report released Monday. ""They are also actively sharing news videos produced by journalism professionals. And news organizations are taking advantage of citizen content and incorporating it into their journalism. ""Consumers, in turn, seem to be embracing the interplay in what they watch and share, creating a new kind of television news."" In effect, Pew describes an emerging partnership of sorts between traditional media outlets and citizen journalists. While many of the tsunami videos were user-generated, they received most of their views after being shared by professional outlets on the site, the report said. CNN has officially embraced citizen journalism since 2006 with CNN iReport, which encourages users around the world to share news, opinions, images and video on a wide range of topics. The second annual iReport Awards this month honored an iReporter's eyewitness footage of the 2011 Indiana State Fair stage collapse, among other video clips. The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism studied 15 months' worth of news videos between January 2011 and March 2012, tracking the five most popular videos each week in the ""News & Politics"" channel on YouTube. ""The data reveal that a complex, symbiotic relationship has developed between citizens and news organizations on YouTube, a relationship that comes close to the continuous journalistic 'dialogue' many observers predicted would become the new journalism online,"" the report said. Among the study's findings: . • Video of natural disasters tends to draw the most attention. • News events outside the United States topped the list. The three most-viewed topics were the tsunami, Russian elections and unrest in the Middle East. As Pew notes, 70% of YouTube's traffic comes from outside the United States. • More than one-third (39%) of the top videos were clearly citizen-generated and another 51% -- making a whopping 90% of all videos studied -- came from news organizations but included some user-created content. • Personalities don't seem to be a big deal for YouTube news seekers. No individual appeared in more than 5% of the top news videos, with President Barack Obama topping the list by appearing in 4%. While the numbers are impressive, they still pale in comparison to the number of viewers of traditional television news. The report compares the 96 million-view week for tsunami videos to the roughly 22 million people who watch network news shows each evening. (That's 154 million over a seven-day period, and doesn't include cable or local news.) The difference, Pew notes, is that sites such as YouTube provide for ""a la carte"" news, letting users choose their own programming. The report does note one potentially troubling aspect of YouTube news sharing. Giving credit for videos, the report said, can get blurry, a problem stemming from a lack of clear ethical guidelines. Researchers found instances of traditional news sites apparently using citizen-created videos without clearly attributing them as well as citizens posting copyrighted material without permission. ""All this creates the potential for news to be manufactured, or even falsified, without giving audiences much ability to know who produced it or how to verify it,"" the report said.","Report: YouTube is becoming home to a new kind of visual journalism .
Pew Research Center says news events are some of YouTube's most popular clips .

"(CNN) -- On Saturday, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera, the kingpin of the Sinaloa drug cartel, was captured in a joint effort by Mexican authorities and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The latest in a series of major cartel arrests under Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, El Chapo's capture is the culmination of a dozen-year transcontinental manhunt to bring down the man who internationalized Mexico's drug trade. El Chapo's significance to transnational organized crime can hardly be overstated. From the Americas to Europe, West Africa to Australia, he was, in a perverse sense, an innovator: the first to develop a truly global narcotics and criminal network that would eventually net him upward of $3 billion each year, according to a 2013 Univision documentary entitled ""El Chapo: CEO of Crime."" And the legend of the kingpin is even greater. Many, including that documentary, credit him with building the first tunnels to subvert the U.S.-Mexico border, with bribing countless officials right here in the United States and with escalating the bloodletting in the fight with Sinaloa's rival cartel, the Zetas. Last year, the city of Chicago labeled El Chapo ""Public Enemy No. 1"" -- a moniker that was last used for Al Capone in the 1930s -- despite the kingpin's never having set foot in the city, according to Forbes. He has been called the Osama bin Laden of drug trafficking -- but more elusive. Given his role in drug trafficking -- not to mention his still more inflated stature in the collective imagination -- it is hard to overstate the symbolic significance of his capture. The sheer scope of his operations, his true corporatization and internationalization of drug trafficking, and the 13-year manhunt that preceded his capture this weekend render immeasurable the symbolic weight of his apprehension. And coming months might see him extradited to the United States, where many feel his trial and eventual imprisonment will be insulated from his power and corruption, which have so effectively protected him in Mexico. The arrest of the most wanted drug lord in the world will provide valuable insight into the vast networks he established but will probably not diminish demand for the products he was so expert at transporting. Drug trafficking will continue, as will the violence and insecurity that go along with it. In the immediate future, El Chapo's arrest might generate some instability. But few believe that his arrest will mean the end of his business. The scope of his power suggests that in his absence, other brokers -- whether from inside his own Sinaloa cartel, through a member of his cohort Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada or from rival cartels such as the Zetas or the Knights Templar -- might seek to fill his shoes. And this scramble could be accompanied by something of a refocusing, as well. With El Chapo, the true honcho of international trafficking, behind bars, we might, at least in the short run, see an uptick in cartel activity within the Western Hemisphere until the next kingpin with transcontinental aspirations emerges. Similarly, his arrest might encourage cartels throughout Mexico, pending their adjustment to his capture, to increase their non-narcotic activities: namely kidnapping, ransom and extortion. A key symbolic victory, El Chapo's arrest speaks to the success of U.S.-Mexico bilateral efforts in the war against transnational crime. But to view this weekend's events as any more than one battle in the larger war would be overly optimistic. Drug cartels will continue their violent operations with or without El Chapo, so his arrest cannot be seen as an endpoint but rather a rallying point for continued efforts to dismantle what he and his contemporaries have built. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carl Meacham.","U.S., Mexican authorities captured kingpin of Sinaloa drug cartel .

"(CNN) -- At least three people died and seven others were rescued Thursday after their boat capsized off the coast of southeastern Florida, the U.S. Coast Guard said. And that toll -- of the dead and rescued -- may rise: The Coast Guard believes that two more people may still be trapped or in the Atlantic Ocean, spurring an intense search for them. A Dutch naval vessel, the Zeeland, heading toward Key West, Florida, first alerted the U.S. Coast Guard at noon about the ship. Specifically, the Coast Guard said, the Dutch sailors reported seeing ""a capsized 24-foot center console vessel with seven suspected migrants atop the hull."" The Dutch sailors rescued those individuals and retrieved three bodies ""from within the hull,"" according to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has since sent the Cutter Richard Etheridge, a 154-foot ship based in Miami, to search for the two missing people. In addition, a C-130 airplane out of Clearwater, Florida, has been dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, they took over the operation from the Dutch navy and will transport those rescued to the Florida mainland, Coast Guard Petty Officer Sabrina Laberdesque told CNN. CNN first learned of the incident via that agency's Twitter account. The Zeeland left the Netherlands 12 days ago en route to the southern tip of Florida, said Lt. Maartje Van Der Maas, a spokeswoman for the Royal Netherlands Navy in the Caribbean. The Dutch sailors will pick up a Coast Guard helicopter in Key West to use over the next four months in drug interdiction operations in the Caribbean. After handing over the rescued people Thursday, the Zeeland continued onto Key West, according to Van Der Maas.","NEW: Spokeswoman: The Dutch ship was going to pick up a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter .

"(CNN) -- Things might be a bit frosty between Graeme McDowell and Gary Woodland in Lake Nona for a little while. The 2010 U.S. Open champion from Northern Ireland lives on the same Florida street as his American counterpart, they often practice together, and they flew out to the Arizona desert together. But that didn't stop McDowell staging a dramatic comeback to win their opening round encounter at the WGC Accenture World Match Play. Woodland was four up at one stage, and three holes up with three to play, before a string of errors opened the door for McDowell. And the 34-year-old needed no second invitation, winning the final three holes, then the first extra hole, to take his place in the second round. ""I'm sure he's extremely disappointed right now -- and I'm extremely elated,"" McDowell told the tournament's official website. ""I thought it was over. You're not coming back from three down against a guy that's playing as well as him. Yeah, I'm still going to try to hit my shots. But it required a mistake from him to give me half a sniff, even. ""I'm surprised to be sitting here, having won. Yeah, I hit a couple of quality shots down the last couple of holes, but he had mistakes, as well. It's a brutal format. ""It feels like a Sunday afternoon on Wednesday."" English duo Ian Poulter and Luke Donald -- both former winners of the event -- were two high-profile casualties in Arizona, dumped out by two men over ten years their junior -- Rickie Fowler and Matteo Manassero. Poulter, who claimed the title in 2010 and is regarded as one of the finest match players in the game due to his Ryder Cup exploits for Europe, trailed early to Fowler, from California, and failed to recover, losing 2&1. The 38-year-old was widely credited with sparking the fight back that led to the 'Miracle of Medinah' when Europe recovered from a 10-6 deficit to the United States to win the 2012 Ryder Cup in Chicago. But after slumping to a first round defeat he Tweeted: ""Disappointed with my performance today do not deserve to move on. Congrats to Rickie Fowler."" Fowler, who has suffered a frustrating start to his 2014 season, told the tournament's official website his victory could kick-start his campaign. ""It feels like a big win after those missed cuts,"" Fowler said. ""It was nice to be the underdog. I had nothing to lose."" Donald, who assumed the WGC crown from Poulter in 2011, was on the end of a comprehensive defeat, losing 6&5 to Manassero, from Italy. The 20-year-old seized the initiative early on in the piece and ensured the match didn't go beyond the 14th hole. Despite his bruising victory, Donald was still pleased with aspects of his game, tweeting: ""Manny played great today and deserved to win, my game is close, excited for the next 3 weeks."" Top seed and world No. 3 Henrik Stenson, from Sweden, trailed Kiradech Aphibarnrat of Thailand with five holes to play but ended up winning on the 17th hole. Three-time major winner Rory McIlroy safely made it through to the next round after beating American Boo Weekley to make it into the last 32. Bubba Watson, who won the Northern Trust Open on Sunday, safely moved into the next round, defeating Mikko Ilonen of Finland, while last year's champion -- Matt Kuchar -- also progressed by beating Bernd Wiesberger.","Graeme McDowell records incredible comeback win over Gary Woodland .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard is interviewing 21 people picked up by two cruise ships off Florida this week to determine their nationalities and whether they should be sent home, a spokesman said Saturday. The rafters are in Coast Guard custody, Petty Officer Mark Barney said. He would not disclose their countries of origin, though one of the ships involved in the rescue, the Carnival Conquest, said the 13 people it picked up are Cuban. The first rescue happened Thursday afternoon, when the Disney Wonder cruise ship picked up eight people on a raft about 45 miles from Key West, the cruise line said. iReporter captures photos of rafters prior to rescue . A picture of the rescue taken by a Turner Broadcasting employee aboard the ship showed a boxy wooden vessel with a makeshift sail next to the ship as the rafters were helped aboard. Disney said the ship acted at the request of the Coast Guard to rescue the rafters. It did not give the nationalities of the eight, who were given medical attention, food and water once aboard. The ship was in the middle of a five-night cruise, a spokeswoman said. The second rescue was Friday afternoon in the same area, about 40 miles from Key West. Carnival said its ship spotted the raft and coordinated with the Coast Guard to take them aboard and give them food, water and medical treatment.

"(CNN) -- Organizers of the music festival in rural Illinois where Tila Tequila was attacked last weekend said they warned the reality TV star that it was dangerous for her to take the stage. The former Playboy model and singer ""seemed to mock and further antagonize the crowd"" by exposing her breasts, the organizers said in a statement Wednesday. Tequila was cut and bruised when the ""Gathering of the Juggalos"" audience pelted her with rocks and bottles, eventually chasing her from the stage. She has vowed to force the festival into bankruptcy with a lawsuit. The annual event attracts mostly young fans of the hip-hop group Insane Clown Posse. Tequila, who was performing rap songs from her upcoming album, was eventually chased from the festival grounds by the fans, who refer to themselves as juggalos and juggalettes. Cuts on her face required stitches. And her body is covered with bruises, Tequila said. A written statement from organizers and Insane Clown Posse called the violence ""extremely unfortunate,"" but it said ""Juggalo Gathering, LLC and Insane Clown Posse are not responsible."" ""Ms. Tequila was made aware, in advance, of her unpopularity with many Juggalos at the Gathering, but she insisted on performing,"" the statement said. She was paid in advance and told she could keep the money if she decided not to perform and that ""she could leave the stage the minute that she felt uncomfortable,"" organizers said. Tequila did say in an interview Monday that she was told just before the show that there could be violence and that she did not have to take the stage. Video obtained by CNN showed Tequila standing her ground on stage for several minutes, continuing to perform her songs while several bodyguards tried to protect her. ""I'm not going anywhere,"" she shouted back. The organizers said Tequila should have realized when ""the crowd began to boo heavily and throw garbage"" that ""she was not welcome."" ""Her injuries were only sustained because of her refusal to leave the stage,"" they said. The assault subsided briefly when comedian Tom Green, who had performed earlier, diverted the crowd's attention with a dance. After Green left the stage, a large rock soared from the crowd, striking Tequila's face. Blood streamed down her cheek. ""After several minutes, she even removed her top, exposing herself, which seemed to mock and further antagonize the crowd,"" the organizers said. ""Finally, Gathering security pulled her off of the stage."" Tequila, in a message posted on her Twitter account Wednesday, defended taking off her top: ""If your face was drippin in blood, and your shirt was smeared in human feces and piss, umm im pretty sure you would take ur dam top off too!"" Among her Twitter messages was this dig at the juggalos: ""The only dumb thing I admit to doing, was actually showing the Juggalos LOVE. Which they know nothing about."" Green described a mob of hundreds chasing Tequila from the stage and surrounding a trailer where she sought refuge. They rocked the trailer and smashed its windows, he said. Tequila eventually escaped, but only after windows in her sports utility vehicle were smashed, according to the Hardin County Sheriff Tom Seiner. Seiner said he has an open investigation. It would be ""very hard"" to identify the attackers, the sheriff said. The incident involving Tequila was not the only violence at the festival early Saturday. Seiner said a 49-year-old Georgia man was arrested as a suspect in the stabbing of another man in the abdomen just hours earlier.","Tequila's breasts antagonized juggalos, organizers say .

"(CNN) -- As Kenya celebrates 50 years of independence, many will be looking back on the events of the last half century, which saw country shake off British colonialism to carve its own identity. But it is also a time to look ahead to the next 50 years, and how technology can shape a new Kenya. Kenya's 50th independence celebrations come at a moment of great economic promise for the continent. Much of the growth has been driven by export of raw materials, investment in infrastructure and expansion of trade in consumer goods. The challenge for the future, however, is building a technological foundation for economic transformation. Probably Kenya's most important technological achievement was pioneering the world-first mobile money transfer system. The transformative innovation is part of a larger revolution in mobile banking. Read more: Tech cities and mega dams: Africa's giant infrastructure projects . Kenya has contributed to the global mobile wallet market that is expanding exponentially. The market is projected to $5.25 billion in 2020 and will be driven by the rapid adoption of smartphones. In its vision to become a middle-income country by 2030, Kenya has singled out scientific and technological advancement as a key driver for growth. Achieving this goal will require the country to do in other sectors what it has done for mobile money transfer and allied financial activities. The first step for Kenya is to consolidate the gains already made in mobile technology. There are already plans underway to promote innovation in mobile technology. But these efforts need high-level political commitment to define the country as a world leader in the extension of mobile technology to other sectors. The key to doing this is building new research universities whose curriculum and teaching are directly influenced by the evolution of the mobile industry. Kenya has recently created the Multimedia University, which was incubated by the ministry of telecommunications. But this university needs to be more directly integrated into the telecommunications sector with a clear focus on advancing all aspects of the mobile revolution. Read more: Africa's super telescopes 'will inspire science boom' Kenya can learn from other countries, such as South Korea, as it embarks on a technological path. In the early 1960s South Korea's main exports included wigs and false teeth. Its success as an industrial nation is largely a result of investing in new research institutions and universities. Kenya needs to embark on a more ambitious technological initiative that can help to galvanize public attention and support the foundation for long-term economic development. One obvious next step for the country is geographic information science and technology. The Kenya Parliament has already passed a motion calling for the creation of a space sector for the country. Drafts of a policy, strategy and bill for creating the sector already exist. The benefits of such an initiative would be profound. It could generate vital data for planning and decision-making in a wide range of areas such as environmental management, business planning and security. It could also help stimulate the creation of new firms marketing technologies and services. Read more: Africa's new high-tech cities . Data generated by the space program would be distributed through existing mobile networks and would add value to current investments such as the fiber-optic backbone. Such a program could help strengthen Kenya's role as a regional technology hub. Such a space program could also help Kenya monitor climate change and support decisions on critical regional resources such as Lake Victoria. Developing a space sector is not just a vanity effort but a critical investment for national development. Advances in technology are dramatically lowering the cost of running such a program. In fact, several sub-Saharan African countries have space plans or programs, of which Nigeria is the most advanced. Read more: How African innovation can take on the world . A technological vision of Kenya's future demands at least two critical activities. First, the country will need to significantly expand its engineering education. One way to do this is to upgrade engineering-based training institutes in line ministries into graduate training institutes or research universities. Second, the presidency will need to be supported on a regular basis by the best available science and technology advice. Such advice will need to be managed by an office of science and technology advice, directly answerable to the head of state. Kenya is at a critical juncture where it has no alternative but to find new pathways for technological leapfrogging. The alternative is falling behind as other players in the region start to invest in moving to new technological frontiers. At 50, the country is overdue to reinvent itself using technological innovation as the engine of economic transformation. Follow Calestous Juma on Twitter @calestous .

"(CNN) -- Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian President who will sit with U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday to discuss the state—and the fate--of Secretary of State John Kerry's peace process is a good man and most likely the best partner for peace negotiations that Washington, this Israeli government or any other is likely to have. He's rational, enlightened and a leader who eschews both violence and the dream that somehow, sometime, the armed struggle, or demography will deliver Palestinians their state. But there's only one pesky problem: Under current circumstances, he cannot deliver his side of a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel. Here's why. The Palestinian consensus . Abbas is in a bind. He's trapped by traditional Palestinian negotiating positions and a narrative that is almost impossible to alter. These positions include: June 1967 borders with minor territorial adjustments, a capital in East Jerusalem, security arrangements that don't suck every bit of sovereignty out of Palestinian statehood, and an acceptable answer to the question of what to do about the volatile issue of ""right of return."" To diverge significantly from them would end his political viability and perhaps his life. Even the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat—whose power, authority and legitimacy conferred some discretion and flexibility-- wouldn't agree to anything short of this consensus. I once heard Arafat remark, at the Camp David Summit: You won't walk behind my coffin. And Abbas has little of Arafat's street cred. He is head of the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian Liberation Organization's executive committee, but is master of none. Not enough urgency . The idea that you could reconcile this Palestinian consensus with Benjamin Netanyahu's bottom lines—assuming you could identify them-- is fantastical. And his self-image is not to become the midwife or father of a Palestinian state based on Abbas' requirements or needs; it is to water them down with U.S. help. Even then the idea that he's prepared to yield to Abbas on borders or Jerusalem is highly improbable. The history of peacemaking on the Israeli side is, to be sure, a history of transformed hawks (see Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin, Ehud Barak, Ehud Olmert). But Netanyahu is different, and circumstances have changed. The region is in turmoil, and Iran is his real priority. There is neither enough pain nor prospect of gain for him to urgently make this deal. Divided Palestinians . Hamas has been greatly weakened. The ouster of Egypt's Mohammed Morsy, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's troubles and Hamas' need to distance itself from Syria have blocked its options. But, between Fatah and Hamas, the Palestinian national movement is still badly divided and resembles a kind of Palestinian Noah's Ark: There are two of everything: statelets, security services, patrons, constitutions and visions of what Palestine is and even where it is. The real problem is that any reconciliation of the two factions will likely further harden Palestinian positions, creating a ""tradeoff"": internal peace in the Palestinian ranks but more tension with Israel, and probably the United States, too. And yet, unless the Palestinians find a way to assume control over the forces of violence in Palestine -- in short, one authority and one gun -- it's hard to see how Israel, even if it could be persuaded to withdraw from the West Bank on paper, would ever do so in practice. The Obama administration understandably cannot deal with the Hamas issue now. Instead, it seems to subscribe to the ""Field of Dreams"" school of diplomacy: If you build it, they will come. According to this logic, an agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority would leave an already weakened Hamas no choice but to put up or shut up. The only problem is that for that to work, the ""it"" that they build would have to be an agreement so compelling that the vast majority of Palestinians would rally around it. That's very hard to see now. No help from Obama . The President would like to be a historic peacemaker. And he made clear in his 2012 interview with Jeffrey Goldberg that he is very frustrated with Prime Minister Netanyahu. But to have a fight with this Israeli Prime Minister over the possibility of a long-shot Israeli-Palestinian deal doesn't add up. A productive fight with Israel that ends up producing a historic peace deal where everyone wins is one thing. But right now that deal is nowhere in sight. Indeed, right now Obama's priorities are Ukraine, Iran, preserving a domestic legacy and maintaining Democratic control of the Senate in the upcoming midterm elections. He has little incentive or capacity to forcefully press Netanyahu for a deal. People may think that a second-term president freed from the need for re-election is free to take a big gamble. But it has really never been the absence of political constraints as much as it is the presence of real opportunity that drives presidents. Obama doesn't want to fail. No cause for alarm? The odds of a conflict-ending agreement between Netanyahu and Abbas in which the core issues that drive the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are resolved are slim to none. Think outcomes, not solutions. But this isn't a cause for despair. Kerry's relentlessness and skill in engaging the parties have created a process that will at least survive the U.S.-imposed April deadline for a peace deal and live at least until year's end. Nobody wants to be blamed for the demise of the Kerry process, and both Netanyahu and Abbas likely wonder--and worry about--what will happen if there is no process. Israel probably doesn't have a Plan B. And Abbas' fallback -- to go to the United Nations and rely on the international community and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement -- doesn't offer much promise without Washington pressuring Israel. And so Abbas' meeting at the White House will go well enough. The President deeply cares about the Palestinians and their cause. And while Abbas won't betray Palestinian positions for Obama's legacy, neither will he humiliate the President. Kerry may yet squeeze out enough from the two sides to produce a piece of paper. In any event, it won't be the Palestinians who spoil the party. President Abbas will almost certainly tell the President, paper or not, deadline be damned, let us continue the important work of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. Peace may not be around the corner, but more negotiations almost certainly are. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Aaron Miller: Abbas to meet with Obama, but he won't be able to deliver his side of peace deal .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russia criticized the United States on Friday for handing down a 25-year sentence to Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, saying the verdict against him was ""baseless and biased."" Bout, who denies wrongdoing, was sentenced Thursday to 25 years behind bars by a federal judge in New York. Bout, who was dubbed ""the merchant of death"" by his accusers, was convicted last year on four counts of conspiracy to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Russia's foreign ministry accused the United States of acting illegally when its agents arrested Bout in Thailand and of pursuing a political agenda after he was extradited to the United States to face trial. In a statement, Russia accused the United States of seeking a forced confession by ""creating intolerable conditions of detention, physical and psychological impact."" In addition, the Russian foreign ministry said, U.S. authorities also encouraged a media campaign against Bout, which was bound to influence the jury. The foreign ministry will do everything it can to bring Bout back to Russia, its statement said. Bout had faced the possibility of life in prison at his sentencing hearing in Manhattan. ""Viktor Bout has been international arms trafficking enemy number one for many years, arming some of the most violent conflicts around the globe,"" said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. ""He was finally brought to justice in an American court for agreeing to provide a staggering number of military-grade weapons to an avowed terrorist organization committed to killing Americans."" At the trial, the prosecution said that during a 2008 sting operation by U.S. drug enforcement agents in Thailand, Bout believed he was selling weapons to Colombian guerrillas. Bout continued to declare his innocence Thursday. ""I am not guilty,"" he said through a translator. ""I never intended to kill anyone. I never intended to sell any arms to anyone. God knows this is the truth."" Bout's wife, Alla, said after the hearing that her husband ""said few words"" in reaction to the sentence. He and his lawyer did not regard the case as lawful, she did. His lawyer, Albert Dayan, filed a letter last week asking Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, who presided over the trial and who set Bout's sentence, to set aside the guilty verdict. Dayan urged the judge not to ""become an unwilling party"" in what he called a ""wrongful prosecution"" for ""purely political reasons."" He argued that the conviction is a ""product of malice"" and that Bout has been an ""object of private politics"" coming from Washington. The lawyer claimed that Bout was picked out by the United States government and lured into a crime manufactured by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, in which the agency played ""the role of judge, jury and executioner. "" In his claim, Dayan insisted that Bout did not intend to sell any arms to the agents, that he had not sold any arms for several years and that the only thing he wanted to sell were two cargo airplanes, worth $5 million. Dayan stood by the claim that DEA officers baited his client into illegal activities. ""I do not profess, I do not argue that he's an angel, but he is innocent of these charges,"" Dayan wrote. ""I felt it was my duty to speak out and let the world know."" According to a federal indictment, Bout was suspected of creating front companies that used his planes to deliver food and medical supplies, as well as arms. After a sting operation in 2008, he was arrested in Thailand and in 2010 was extradited to the United States following a protracted court proceeding. He was convicted in November after a three-week trial in New York. Before his arrest, the DEA had struggled to draw Bout out of his Russian homeland, which is long thought to have sheltered and defended him. Undercover agents met with Bout's associates the world over, from Curacao to Copenhagen, in an attempt to set up a meeting with their target, according to the indictment. The Russian businessman also has been accused of assembling a fleet of cargo planes to traffic military-grade weapons to conflict zones around the world since the 1990s. Allegations of trafficking activities in Liberia prompted U.S. authorities to freeze his American assets in 2004 and prohibited U.S. transactions with him, according to the indictment. Bout has maintained that he operated legitimate businesses and had acted as a mere logistics provider. His exact age is unclear, but he is believed to be in his late 40s or 50s, with his age in dispute because of different passports and documents. The U.S. attorney's office said it had no confirmed age. Critics have accused Bout of providing arms to rebels in several countries and fueling bloody conflicts in places such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. In 2000, then-British Foreign Office official Peter Hain branded him ""Africa's chief merchant of death"" at a time when Bout is believed to have supplied arms to officials in Sierra Leone, a former British colony then embroiled in civil war.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- It used to be an old factory churning out parts for the mining industry before slowly falling into neglect and turned into a garage for vehicle repairs. But now, after a renovation process, the high-ceilinged warehouse has been reinvented as a modern art deco space intended to house Africa's most cutting-edge design ideas and exhibit them to the world. Welcome to the Museum of African Design, or MOAD, a 2,500 square meter space which claims to be the first of its kind on the continent. Situated inside Johannesburg's vibrant Maboneng precinct, a former crime hotspot that's undergoing an urban rejuvenation, MOAD opened its doors late last month with the vision to become a pan-African platform for contemporary creativity and innovation. Read this: Joburg gets downtown revamp . ""The goal for it is really to become a cultural hub,"" explains Aaron Kohn, the young and enthusiastic director of MOAD. ""A place to showcase what's going on the continent that's innovative but also to encourage that kind of thinking, design and creativity to young South Africans and to people visiting Johannesburg at the same time."" True to its character . The spacious downtown building, which dates back to the 1920s, had been earmarked as a museum since its acquisition by the Maboneng developers in 2011. But it only hosted a number of temporary exhibitions and events during the past year before work started in July to transform it into a permanent home for African design. Read this: Africa's most exciting new photographers . The developers went on to add an extra floor, bathrooms and a cocktail bar but kept the building's integrity largely intact -- raw floors, metal bars and scaffolding ramps still dominate the three-level space, creating a rough-edged atmosphere that echoes the identity of the building and its urban surroundings. ""We will continue 'refining' the space, but the goal is to leave it as original and industrial as possible,"" explains Kohn. 'New ways to see the world' The museum's launch event took place on October 24 with the annual showcase of the Southern Guild collection, a 10-day exhibition presenting the creations of some of South Africa's top designers and artists. Renowned architect David Adjaye, who was born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents, was the guest of honor at the event. ""I believe in design as a very important edifying element for community, for culture, for civilization,"" he told CNN hours before the official opening. ""I think it's one of the hallmarks of how we talk about creating awareness about who we are and what values we have in the world,"" added Adjaye. Read this: David Adjaye's favorite buildings . ""Design is very good, it's almost like a diver; it seeks out new ways which you can see the world; it goes down and discovers new things that bring it back up and it shows it to us. I think that's really important."" 'Native Nostalgia' After the launch event, which had a South African focus, MOAD is now making its first foray into the continent's creativity with ""Native Nostalgia,"" the museum's inaugural full-length exhibition. Starting today, the group show explores the idea of nostalgia and what it means for African artists to look at dark chapters in history, including apartheid and colonialism, in a fond manner. It features a series of mixed media creations from a number of African artists, including Leonce Raphael Agbodjelou from Benin, Amina Menia from Algeria, The Nigeria Nostalgia Project and South African collective I See a Different You. Read this: Tribal beauty of vanishing life . ""Native Nostalgia"" is curated by Kohn, but the MOAD director says that in the future the museum will be working with different people for every exhibition. He also outlines that MOAD is not interested in becoming a collective institution that stores art or wastes any budget on insurance and acquiring fees. ""We want to focus on the most exciting and relevant exhibitions that we can put on with works from across the continent,"" says Kohn. ""I think that's a new model that a lot more institutions around the world are looking at in terms of not having necessarily conventional museum staff, not having a permanent collection -- it allows an institution that's interested in the contemporary to stay contemporary,"" adds Kohn. ""Native Nostalgia"" runs until February 9. Upcoming exhibitions at MOAD include ""Fashioning Africa,"" running from March to May, and ""Design of an African City,"" from June to August.","Africa's first museum dedicated to design opened its doors late last month .

"(CNN) -- Former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards was released from federal prison Thursday after serving about 10 years, the federal Bureau of Prisons said. Edwards was convicted of racketeering, conspiracy and extortion after prosecutors said he asked for payoffs from people who applied for riverboat casino licenses in New Orleans in the 1990s. Edwards, 83, had pursued a pardon from President George W. Bush, but never got one. He began serving his sentence in February 2001. He was released from prison to a halfway house, said Edmond Ross, spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons. At Edwards' trial in 2000, star witness Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, got a reduced sentence in exchange for testifying about his own $400,000 bribe to Edwards. He said he had felt compelled to make the payment. DeBartolo ended up not going through with the project after the scandal broke. Allegations of corruption dogged Edwards throughout much of his political career, but he always maintained that he'd never lose an election, and famously joked that he'd keep his office unless he was caught ""in bed with a dead girl or a live boy."" Frequently during his trial -- for allegedly extorting almost $3 million from casino applicants -- he held his own court on the courthouse steps. ""Today, I took care of some housekeeping and had my car fixed and went and cashed a check before they freeze my accounts,"" he told reporters at one point. Edwards served several terms in office -- from 1972 to 1980, 1984 to 1988 and 1992 to 1996. The Democrat, U.S. Navy aviation cadet and lawyer began his career as a city councilman and state representative before being elected to Congress, and then governor. He won his first gubernatorial term ""by an unprecedented combination of 'Cajun' and black votes,"" according to his biography on the Louisiana Secretary of State's website. ""Edwards named blacks to key state positions and his support of black politicians resulted in a mutually beneficial relationship,"" the biography says. His third term ""was marked by federal indictments, but not convictions, for mail fraud, obstruction of justice and public bribery,"" the biography adds. The bio does not refer to Edwards' conviction later on. The U.S. District Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, on its website, describes Edwards as ""leader of the corrupt enterprise whose objectives included the illegal and corrupt manipulation of the riverboat gaming licensing process during and after his four terms as governor."" ""Also convicted were Edwin's son, Stephen Edwards and his close associates Andrew Martin, Cecil Brown, and Bobby Johnson,"" the office says. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","The former governor was convicted of extortion in casino industry .
