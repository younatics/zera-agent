"Celebrity fans include Kristen Stewart and Azealia Banks . £650 shoe available in tangerine or classic black . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 06:33 EST, 4 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:20 EST, 5 October 2012 . Celebrities and fashionistas are getting all strung up this season with the latest pair of killer heels from renowned footwear designer Jimmy Choo. As part of the Cruise 13 collection, Jimmy Choo introduces the Taste sandal and it seems footwear fans can't get enough. Azealia Banks, Elizabeth Banks, Ginnifer Goodwin and Kristin Stewart have all been spotted in the  fashion-forward footwear, which won't be available for non-celebrities until November this year. Scroll down for video . Ginnifer Goodwin and Elizabeth Banks are big fans of the latest Jimmy Choo Taste sandal and have been spotted wearing the design on the red carpet . Kristen Stewart scored a fashion ace when she donned the shoe at the On The Road premiere in New York . The suede sandal, which comes in the oh-so-summery bold tangerine or classic black, has a 120mm heel and is designed using fishing wire to suspend the 'T' bar on the foot. Kristen Stewart chose the shoes for her first public appearances following her split from Robert Pattinson, getting the thumbs up from the fashion pack and waiting lists have already started despite the killer heels having a painful £650 price tag. The new design comes in bold tangerine or classic black and costs £650 . The brand traces its roots to a bespoke shoemaker named Jimmy Choo, based in the East End of London in the early 1990s, who catered to the global jet set, including Princess Diana. The Jimmy Choo company was founded in 1996, when Tamara Mellon, OBE, then an accessories editor at British Vogue, discovered Mr Choo and recognizing a niche in the luxury shoe market, she established the Jimmy Choo brand. Mr Choo’s niece, Sandra Choi, joined the business as Creative Director. Jimmy Choo attracted outside investment and the company embarked on a significant expansion across product categories, channels and geographies. Mr Choo departed the company in 2001 and Ms Mellon departed in 2011. The first Jimmy Choo store was opened in 1996 on Motcomb Street in London, complementing a distribution in some of the most prestigious multi-brand stores in the world. Two years later, the company expanded to the US, opening two stores in New York City and Beverly Hills. Today, Jimmy Choo encompasses a complete luxury lifestyle brand. Women’s shoes remain the core of the product offer, alongside handbags, small leather goods, scarves, sunglasses, eyewear, belts, fragrance and men’s shoes. The design direction is overseen by Creative Directors Sandra Choi and Simon Holloway, who together share a vision to create one of the world’s most treasured luxury brands. Part of Labelux GmbH, a privately held luxury goods group, Jimmy Choo has more than 150 stores in 32 countries and is present in the most prestigious department and specialty stores worldwide.","Celebrity fans include Kristen Stewart and Azealia Banks .

A millionaire who made his fortune on the London property market and once dated model Caprice has died after falling under a Tube train. Robert Curtis, 47, was said to have lived 'the high life' after launching a successful business letting upmarket properties in the early 2000s. But his life spiralled into disarray after his business empire crumbled during the recession as well as personal tragedies including the suicide of his friend Paul Castle and a failed marriage. Jet-set lifestyle: Robert Curtis, left, made his fortune in the London property market and once dated model Caprice, right . Mr Curtis died at Kingsbury station. Polo-playing Mr Castle, 54, a friend of Prince Charles, threw himself in front of a train at Bond Street station as he faced bankruptcy and illness two years ago last month, the London Evening Standard reports tonight. Known to friends as 'Robbie', Mr Curtis made a fortune in the property boom with string of successful letting businesses run from his St John’s Wood HQ. Mr Curtis died after falling under a Tube train at Kingsbury station in north west London . He had a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce with personalised number plate and wardrobes full of designer clothes. The father-of-one crossed the world for parties and business meetings before divorce and financial problems took their toll.His main money spinner was as an agent for letting expensive properties, a booming market in the early Noughties. At different times, he was a director of 15 firms, Companies House records show. Mr Curtis' friend Paul Castle - who played polo with Prince Charles - threw himself in front of a train at bond Street station as he faced bankruptcy and illness two years ago . But by the time he died all but one had folded as the recession burst the property bubble.He suffered from depression and his life fell apart, according to friends and neighbours at the Barnet mansion block where he moved when his marriage ended, living there with his  mother, Pamela, and father, Monty, until three months ago.His parents now live in sheltered accommodation in Kingsbury, where Mr Curtis died at the local station under a Jubilee line train two weeks ago. His former accountant Anthony Morris paid tribute today to a 'cavalier, ebullient' businessman prone to highs and lows.'Robbie made tons of money and spent it, he was a mover and shaker,' he said. 'He lived the high life.' He said he had heard Mr Curtis dated Caprice: 'That’s the kind of life he was leading.' He said Mr Curtis considered property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz his mentor in the business world and the two became close friends. Neighbours in Barnet described Mr Curtis as courteous. One said: 'His mother was unwell and he and his father were looking after her. He was a very caring son who paid for the place where they were living.'He moved here after his marriage broke up. His wife and daughter used to visit.' Another neighbour said: 'He had a relationship with a girl and gave her a ring and money. More or less the day after... she went to Iran, and he was very upset.'Mr Curtis’s parents were too upset to speak about his death. Police said the death is being treated as non-suspicious.","Robert Curtis, 47, made fortune on London property market .

"By . Alan Rimmer and Christine Challand . PUBLISHED: . 17:08 EST, 16 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:08 EST, 16 March 2013 . 'Abused position of trust': Vicky Callaghan is now living with a 16-year-old boy . The mother of a troubled 16-year-old boy has slammed council officials for allowing him to set up home with his blonde 33-year-old care worker. The mother said she was furious after nothing was done to prevent her son moving in with Vicky Callaghan, who was one of his support team at his residential school. Mrs Callaghan, who has two children under five, resigned from her job as mental health practitioner at the school for boys with severe emotional and behavioural problems after the affair came to light. Police and social workers have visited the pair as part of a council child protection investigation and a report has concluded: ‘Technically both parties are able to be in a relationship with each other regardless of how “appropriate” this is.’ But the boy’s mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has described the situation as ‘absolutely disgraceful’. She said: ‘I knew my son was close to Vicky, but I didn’t realise just how close. ‘I have seen a lot of pictures of them together, but you wouldn’t dream they’d go off together. ‘I can’t believe the council allowed it and I can’t understand how this woman has been allowed to get away with it.’ The mother, who has five other children and lives with her partner in a two-bedroom council maisonette, added that her son had been referred to the school because he had dyslexia, and that ‘this Vicky’ had told her he had anger issues. ‘I asked her what the school was going to do about it and she said they would give him a course of therapy. ‘The next thing I knew they were shacked up together. Is that what they call therapy these days? What exactly are they running there?’ The boy’s mother admits to an unconventional lifestyle. She lists her hobbies as ‘the Sun, Brothers cider, and Pit Bulls’ on a social networking site. As she spoke to The Mail on Sunday she apologised for wearing a teddy bear-style hat, saying: ‘I’ve just had my hair done.’ Suspicions about the relationship were first raised when Mrs Callaghan’s colleagues noticed her and the boy having frequent one-to-one sessions. Things came to a head when they were spotted together outside the school, which is strictly forbidden. She was reportedly seen picking him up in his car. Mrs Callaghan and the boy, who has left the school, now live in a smart three-bedroom bungalow in a well-heeled village about a mile from the former home she shared with her estranged husband Peter, 46. Unconventional lifestyle: The boy's mother lists her hobbies as 'the Sun, Brothers cider, and Pit Bulls (pictured)' on a social networking site . Mrs Callaghan said it would be ‘inappropriate’ to talk about the relationship when The Mail on Sunday visited her at the bungalow. She answered the door and smiled as the 16-year-stood stood behind her in the hallway. ‘I really would love to put the record straight and give my side of the story but I can’t,’ she told a reporter. Mr Callaghan knew the boy, who reportedly walks around the village holding hands with and kissing Mrs Callaghan, because he also used to work at the school, as a social worker. He too has complained about the relationship being allowed to continue. A relative said: ‘He was basically told that because the teenager hadn’t made a complaint, there was nothing anyone could do.’ In an internal report, seen by The Mail on Sunday, a senior council official wrote: ‘It is clear that Mrs Callaghan has shown very poor judgment and that she has abused her position of trust and should not be allowed to work with young people in future.’","Mother furious after nothing done to prevent son moving in with Vicky Callaghan and described situation as 'absolutely disgraceful'

We have already become familiar with the sight of Curiosity on the Martian surface, but Nasa today revealed one of the most human-like images of the rover, showing its 'face' on the surface of the red planet. The image was taken moments before engineers sent commands to remove the dust covers from one of Curiosity's most important cameras for the first time. It was then calibrated using a 'lucky penny' hidden on the rover's arm, before taking a series of astonishing shots of its wheels on the red planet's surface. Nasa today revealed stunning new images of Curiosity's wheel on the martian surface taken using the high resolution Mahli camera, which had its dustcover removed for the first time . With dust cover: The Curiosity rover used a camera located on its arm to obtain this self portrait, taken before engineers removed its dust cover . The images were taken with the Mars Hand Lens Imager (Mahli) camera. 'The self-focusing, roughly 4-centimeter-wide (1.5-inch-wide) camera will take color images of features as small as 12.5 micrometers, smaller than the diameter of a human hair. 'Mahli carries both white light sources, similar to the light from a flashlight, and ultraviolet light sources, similar to the light from a tanning lamp, making the imager functional both day and night. 'The ultraviolet light will be used to induce fluorescence to help detect carbonate and evaporite minerals, both of which indicate that water helped shape the landscape on Mars.' The team have also revealed the first evidence of Curiosity carrying cash. Engineers placed a lucky penny onboard to allow the rover to calibrate its camera. It is a 1909 ""VDB"" cent, from the first year Lincoln pennies were minted, the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth, with the VDB initials of the coin's designer - Victor David Brenner -- on the reverse. MAHLI's close-up inspections of Martian rocks and soil will show details so tiny, the calibration target includes reference lines finer than a human hair. Nasa’s staff say the penny is a nod to an age old trick used on earth. 'When a geologist takes pictures of rock outcrops she is studying, she wants an object of known scale in the photographs,' said MAHLI Principal Investigator Ken Edgett, of Malin Space Science Systems, San Diego. 'If it is a whole cliff face, she'll ask a person to stand in the shot. 'If it is a view from a meter or so away, she might use a rock hammer. 'If it is a close-up, as the MAHLI can take, she might pull something small out of her pocket. 'Like a penny.' Open: The reclosable dust cover on Curiosity's Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) was opened for the first time during the 33rd Martian day, or sol, of the rover's mission on Mars . Wheels down: Nasa used the newly uncovered Mahli camera to take a series of images of the rover's wheel on the red planet's surface . The new images also give tantalising views of the nearby mountains that Curiosity will eventually climb in its quest for for ingredients of life on the red planet . The images also reveal Curiosity's large wheels and distinctive tyre tracks, which leave morse code messages on the surface as it travels .

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 05:17 EST, 9 February 2012 . The giant black hole at the centre of the Milky Way may be devouring asteroids, creating flares that can be observed from Earth around once a day. Nasa scientists detected X-ray flares from the supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A* - the flares last a few hours, and can be 100 times brighter than the black hole's normal energy output. The black hole is surrounded by a cloud of trillions of asteroids and comets, say the scientists - and asteroids passing within 100 million miles of Sagittarius A*, the distance between Earth and the sun, will be pulled in and vapourised. The panel on the left shows a very long Chandra observation of the region around the Sgr A*, the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, while the three panels on the right are artist's impressions of the path that a doomed asteroid would take on its way to the black hole . 'People have had doubts about whether asteroids could form at all in the harsh environment near a supermassive black hole,' said Kastytis Zubovas of the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom. 'Our study suggests that a huge number of them are needed to produce these flares.' 'An asteroid’s orbit can change if it . ventures too close to a star or planet near Sgr A*,' said co-author . Sergei Nayakshin, also of the University of Leicester. 'If it’s thrown . toward the black hole, it’s doomed.' The flares - which have also been detected in infrared by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile - are thought to be created by space rocks above twelve miles in diameter. The black hole may also be 'eating' smaller rocks, but the flares would be more difficult to spot. Asteroids passing too close to the black hole - a huge object with a mass estimated to be at least half a million Suns - would be vaporized by friction as they pass through the hot, thin gas flowing into Sgr A*, similar to a meteor heating up and glowing as it falls through Earth’s atmosphere. A flare is produced as the asteroid is swallowed eventually by the black hole. A new study suggests that there is a cloud around Sgr A* containing trillions of asteroids and comets, stripped from their parent stars. The flares occur when asteroids of six miles or larger in radius are consumed by the black hole . Zubovas and his colleagues suggest there . is a cloud around Sgr A* containing trillions of asteroids and comets, . stripped from their parent stars. These results agree with theories of how many asteroids are likely to be in this region, assuming that the number around stars near Earth is similar to the number surrounding stars near the center of the Milky Way.'As a reality check, we worked out that a few trillion asteroids should have been removed by the black hole over the 10-billion-year lifetime of the galaxy,' said co-author Sera Markoff of the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. 'Only a small fraction of the total would have been consumed, so the supply of asteroids would hardly be depleted.'Planets thrown into orbits too close to Sgr A* also should be disrupted by tidal forces, although this would happen much less frequently than the disruption of asteroids, because planets are not as common. Such a scenario may have been responsible for a previous X-ray brightening of Sgr A* by about a factor of a million about a century ago. While this event happened many decades before X-ray telescopes existed, Chandra and other X-ray missions have seen evidence of an X-ray 'light echo' reflecting off nearby clouds, providing a measure of the brightness and timing of the flare.“This would be a sudden end to the planet’s life, a much more dramatic fate than the planets in our solar system ever will experience,”","Flares seen from Earth caused by six-mile-wide rocks being vaporised .

After all, the Harries boys - who also have a younger sister named Emmy Lou - have a pretty high-flying creative family to entertain. Their parents are Bafta Award-winning producer of The Queen Andy Harries and documentary film-maker and novelist Rebecca Frayn. Their maternal grandparents are award-winning novelist and playwright Michael Frayn and journalist Claire Tomalin. Who can resist two dashing identical twins larking about in a pair of novelty Australian umbrella hats?

The twins already have a YouTube channel, and their own website is currently under construction . Jack - a comic actor who starred in Channel 4 sketch show School Of Comedy and, once, a KFC advert - launched the video diary alone, starring in, producing and editing the videos himself. In one he unicycles around his bedroom while playing the harmonica and juggling. A few people watched. But when he introduced his . identical twin brother Finn, the vlogging community went berserk.

'After much persuasion, he acquiesced and the film Twins soon became the channel’s most popular film,' Frayn said. 'The fact that Jack had a twin was a revelation to the admiring and mainly female fan base. A brand identity was emerging, and now both sons appeared to have been bitten by the YouTube bug.' So popular are the boys now that Sky TV has offered them a series and Capital Radio a Saturday show. To their parents' initial 'dismay', the brothers chose to drop out of their respective universities (Jack from Bristol, Finn from Leeds) to concentrate on their now-lucrative film enterprise.

Layne said he couldn't control his temper if things went wrong, destroying computer equipment and kicking doors and the car dashboard.

She said she shot Hoffman after he kicked her and struck her in the head. Layne then rushed to the basement from a third-floor loft to hide. She said she returned and shot the teen again after he grabbed for the gun. 'I was afraid it would start all over again,' Layne testified. Authorities said Layne of West Bloomfield Township fired 10 shots, striking Hoffman six times, even while he was on the phone with 911 begging for help. During her trial last week, prosecutors described how an already wounded Hoffman pleaded with a . 911 dispatcher to send help as Layne shot him again on May 18 last year. Hoffman 'thought he was safe... Sandra Layne walks up and . shoots him again. This time in the stomach,' Paul Walton, Oakland . County's chief assistant prosecutor, said during his opening statement on March 5. On trial: Sandra Layne smiles at her family while entering the court room of Oakland Circuit Court on March 5.

Sabbota countered that the diminutive Layne feared for her safety during . the fatal confrontation in the West Bloomfield Township . condo that Hoffman shared with his grandparents. An autopsy revealed . Hoffman was shot three times in the chest, once in the abdomen and once . in his left arm. Tests showed the teen had traces of synthetic marijuana . in his body. Officers had been called to the home northwest of . Detroit about two months earlier, when Layne told police she was having a . difficult time because her grandson was very upset and yelling.

But United went above and beyond last month, when it delayed a flight to Lubbock, Texas, so a passenger could get home in time to say goodbye to his dying mother. Kerry Drake got a call from his brother on the morning on January 24, informing him that their mom, Dolores, who'd suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for decades, didn't have long. So he booked the first flight out of San Fransisco, where he works for the government. But the connection, in Houston, was tight. Sympathetic: United Airlines went above and beyond last month, when it delayed a flight to Lubbock, Texas, so a passenger could get home in time to say goodbye to his dying mother (stock photo) 'I knew this itinerary was a risk because the stopover in Houston was only about 40 minutes, and my connecting flight was the last flight to Lubbock that day,' Drake told consumer advocate Christopher Elliott. 'But I needed to get there as soon as possible, so I took the risk.' As fate would have it, his first leg, United flight 667, was delayed half an hour taking off. The news left the loving son visibly distraught, as he faced the very real possibility that he'd get to Lubbock too late to see his mother before she died. Noticing Drake in tears, flight attendant Sofia Lares tried to comfort him, bringing him extra napkins in lieu of tissues and vowing to do whatever they could to help him out. Another flight attendant, Lan Chung, asked Drake what his flight number from Houston to Lubbock was and relayed it to the captain who himself was trying to make up time in the air on Drake's behalf. But the aircraft touched down after Drake's second leg was due to have left the gate, and the man thought all hope was lost. 'As I was running up to the gate, the gate agent saw me coming and shouted, ""Mr. Drake? We've been expecting you"",' he said. 'That's when I knew they had conspired to help me. She waved me onto the plane without looking at my boarding pass.' Delayed: Staff delayed the plane for Kerry Drake and not only did the emotional son make it to Lubbock as scheduled, but so did his bags (stock photo) United Airlines had delayed the plane by around 15 to 20 minutes for him and not only did the emotional son make it to Lubbock as scheduled, but so did his bags. And it was just as well he got that flight. 'Had I missed my flight to Lubbock, I would not have been able to tell my mom goodbye,' Drake told Elliot's blog. He said she opened her eyes at one point during the night, which he spent by her side in hospital with his brother and father, and seemed to recognized him. But after a final rally at around 4 a.m. Dolores passed away on the morning of January 25. 'When she died, I realized I was wiping away my tears with the extra United napkins that Sofia had given me the day before,' he said. When he finally had time to think, Drake was overwhelmed by the good will that had gone into getting him on the plane to Lubbock. 'I was overcome with emotion,' he told CNN. He wrote a letter to United Airlines when he got home to ensure management knew how the flight attendants, pilots and baggage handlers went out of their way to help him. 'Our employees really worked together that day to help this customer,' United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy told CNN.","Kerry Drake got a call on January 24 that his mom, who'd .

Tabitha Gentry was arrested late Thursday and charged with aggravated burglary, criminal trespassing and theft of property over $60,000 . The family of the young mother arrested on Thursday evening after illegally squatting for the past week inside a $2.7million Memphis mansion, have spoken out about how she became radicalized after falling under the influence of the anti-government group known as the Moorish National Movement. Tabitha Gentry, 32, and two of her six children moved into the mansion in the exclusive Shady Grove neighborhood of Memphis on Monday. Family members say Gentry, from the Memphis suburb of Horn Lake, has undergone a radical change of personality since falling under the influence of the Moorish and that she was once an honor student and high school basketball player with a promising future. ‘Very smart. They said she was on the dean's list at school,’ cousin Trenisha Gentry told Myfoxmemphis. ‘She never went without making the honor roll or principal's list.’ But Tabitha’s life changed radically after she met and fell in love with Darrin Fleming, who introduced her to the Moorish National Movement. Since then she has undergone a metamorphosis which has seen her change her appearance and assume the name Abka Re Bey. ‘She has never had braids and she was never part of no Moorish Nation or something like that,’ said Trenisha. ‘Ever since she met him she's changed. She really has. We noticed she started having more things like she's got a huge truck, an Excursion.’ A group of squatters, pictured, broke into the $3million mansion in Memphis, Tennessee earlier this week and had refused to leave . Foreclosed: The decadent four acre residence, complete with a home theater and swimming pool, was foreclosed in August 2011 and has been sitting empty for 18 months . Gentry pictured at the time of her arrest last November when she was charged with aggravated assault for trying to run over a police officer . Gentry, who has six children aged between 11 years and 14 months, was arrested late on Thursday evening and charged with aggravated burglary, criminal trespassing and theft of property over $60,000. She claims to be a sovereign citizen . of the Moorish National Movement, who believes the law does not apply to . her. Gentry filed paperwork with the Shelby County Register of Deeds on . February 25, claiming to seize the property on the 600-block of S Shady . Grove 'in the name of Allah, the Most High, Creator of the Heavens and . Earth.' On Thursday night a judge signed a . warrant for police to raid the house after a grandparent of one . of the children inside asked them to intervene. Within five minutes a SWAT . team had arrived in an armored vehicle full of officers . armed with assault rifles and they quickly gained entry by smashing through the gates. Gentry was caught driving . away from the scene at 11.30pm on Thursday in a white Jaguar, which also contained a 13-year-old . child. She was promptly arrested and charged with burglary. Tabitha Gentry was booked at the . Shelby County Jail at 2:45 a.m. on Friday, March 8. She is being held on . a $2 million bond, and is scheduled to appear in court March 11. Forcing entry: SWAT teams used welding equipment to gain access to the house on Thursday night . Chain: The group, who claim to be Moorish American Nationals, padlocked the gate of the $3million home . Two juveniles were also removed from . the home; one child has been released into her aunt's custody, and the . second child is still in the custody of the Department of Child . Services. The case is still under . investigation. The Shelby County Sheriff's Public Information Officer, . Chip Washington, stated additional suspects and charges are likely, reports ABC. This isn't Gentry's first tangle with . the law. Last November she was charged with aggravated assault for trying . to run over a police officer during a traffic stop in south Memphis. At . the time she provided police with a sovereign citizen identification . card. That case could be headed toward a Shelby County grand jury for indictment. The 10,000 square foot home is owned by Renesant Bank after . going into foreclosure in August 2011. Claim: The squatters wrote a note on the gate claiming that the bank cannot own property and that the home, which was valued last year at $3.2 million, was theirs . The squatters broke into the home on Monday and chained the gate. On Wednesday they ignored a . bank-imposed deadline to vacate the property. They were first discovered on . Monday by Daniel Brown who visits the property on Shady Grove Road, a high-end neighborhood, every week to clean the pool. He said he arrived to find the gate padlocked with 'no trespassing' signs posted to it. The . squatters, who were captured laughing in the window in local TV . footage, even wrote a note on the gate claiming that the bank couldn't own . property and that the home, which was valued last year at $3.2 million, . was theirs. 'The signage said the bank cannot own property, and that they had the original deed to the house and that they were taking them to court and there were eight other properties,' Brown told WMCTV.com. The inhabitants, who were contacted by email, said their indigenous ancestry granted them ownership of the mansion. They added that they believe in 'love, truth, peace, freedom and justice.' Expensive: In 2006, the residence, pictured in real estate photos, was bought for $3.9 million by Richard and April Rice . Repossessed: Renasant Bank assumed ownership in August 2011 and the home had been empty for more than a year . Power: The home still had utilities but no furniture according to neighbors . Neighbors were outraged that the squatters had bedded into their exclusive neighborhood. 'Well, I'm stunned really,' David Peck told WMCTV.com. 'I know the two former owners. And I knew the house was on the market, but I've never heard of anything like this.' Another neighbor, Vallie Jo Bell, said: 'We were just really surprised. I hope they'll get out and maybe find another place to live.' The home and property, totaling almost four acres, were valued at $3.2 million in 2012. Ancestry: The inhabitants claimed in an email that their indigenous ancestry granted them ownership of the mansion . Angry: Neighbors are outraged that the squatters bedded in on their well-to-do street . The bank had ordered the illegal tenants to move out of the home by 2:30pm on Wednesday but they refused . In 2006, Richard and April Rice bought the residence for $3.9 million but Renasant Bank assumed ownership in August 2011.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 07:43 EST, 11 July 2011 . A toddler born with all his internal organs on the opposite side of his body has defied the odds to go home for the first time - one year after doctors declared him clinically dead. Kian Hill, nicknamed 'mirror boy' by his family, was born with situs inversus totalis, which means his internal organs developed on the wrong side of his body. Day visit: Kian with his mother Natalie on a short trip to his home. He will be discharged from hospital in time for his second birthday next month . The condition, which affects around one in 10,000 people in the UK, usually means patients need 24-hour care and spend their lives in hospital. Doctors gave Kian a 50 per cent . chance of survival and last year he was even declared clinically dead . for 30 minutes after suffering two cardiac arrests. He also underwent a risky operation to double the width of his windpipe. But . Kian will be discharged from hospital for the first time on Friday in . time for his second birthday at home in Lea Hall, Birmingham. Mother . Natalie Boughey, 22, said: 'We just can't wait to get Kian home. He's . never slept in his own bed because he's been in hospital every night of . his life. It's going to be a very special homecoming. 'The last couple of years have been a rollercoaster of emotion but to have him home will be the greatest gift of all. 'He is such a sweet little boy, he's been through so much pain, he never stops smiling. We call him our mirror boy.' Mirror image: A scan reveals a missing right lung and heart on the wrong side of Kian's body . Kian stunned doctors when he was born on August 7, 2009 after a normal pregnancy. Medics found his heart was on the right-hand side of his body and was also back-to-front. Both . the youngster's kidneys are twisted in reverse and his stomach and . pancreas are on opposite sides with his intestines coiling in the wrong . direction. He was also born without a spleen, an appendix and a right lung and has been in hospital since birth. Kian has undergone dozens of operations and procedures on an almost daily basis since he was born. Every month doctors performed a bronchoscopy, a procedure where a tiny camera was inserted down this throat to inspect the width of his airways and single lung. Then when he was just seven-and-a-half months old surgeons cut his trachea in half and slid one side on top of the other to create a wider windpipe. The operation is so rare it has been performed on less than 50 children in the UK. Mother Natalie, a trainee dental nurse, said: 'I had seven scans while Kian was in my womb and they didn't pick up any problem. 'But I could tell that something was wrong. I just knew it innately. 'When he was born, the medical staff took him away for tests because he was struggling to breathe. 'We kept being told not to get our hopes up and that there was less than a 50/50 chance he would survive - we were absolutely terrified.' Christmas Day, 2010: Kian spent the day in Birmingham Children's Hospital on the high dependency unit . Natalie and partner Craig Hill, 27, an ambulance driver, were so convinced he would die they even planned Kian's funeral. Their son was declared clinically dead last February after he suffered two cardiac arrests in two days. Stomach acid from gastro-reflux slipped down his trachea into his lungs causing his heart to stop. But doctors managed to resuscitate him after 30 minutes. He has made such an improvement that Natalie and Craig have been allowed to take him home. He will need monthly check-ups in hospital but is expected to live a normal life. Natalie and Craig, who also have healthy son Ryan, four, have built a £18,000 extension to their house, which they call 'Kian's Wing' to accommodate his medical equipment. Natalie said: 'He will have a lot of the same medical equipment at home than he does at the hospital but he is gaining in strength to come home. 'We call it 'Kian's wing' of our house. We don't know how long he will have to be connected to the equipment. Time will tell how he develops in the future.' Kian is fed by having a nutrient-rich milkshake called Peptamen, pumped directly into his stomach. He will remain connected to an oxygen supply and a saturation monitor which checks his pulse and oxygen levels which he will transport on a mobile trolley. Dr Jane Clarke, Kian's respiratory consultant at Birmingham Children's Hospital, said: 'Kian is an amazing boy who was born with a very unusual condition which has caused him numerous health problems, including a missing lung and very narrow trachea. 'We don't know what the future holds for him, but he is a happy and cheeky little boy, despite his health problems.'","Kian was born without a right lung, spleen or appendix ."

Never before seen underwater footage of the Costa Concordia salvage operation has emerged as the year anniversary of the ship's sinking approaches. The cruise ship still remains marooned and half-sunk off the coast of Tuscany - a haunting reminder of the tragedy which saw 32 people lose their lives on January 13, 2012. It was estimated the salvage operation would take at least a year after the ship ran into a reef and capsized off the coast of the Tuscan island of Giglio after Captain Francesco Schettino allegedly made an unauthorised diversion from his programmed route. Scroll down to watch the video . Marooned: Footage shows the Costa Concordia ship still on its side off the coast of Tuscany nearly a year after it sank . Underwater scenes: The ship bell of the Costa Concordia can be seen still submerged under the sea . The furniture of the ship can still be seen completely untouched since the crash . CBS News 60 Minutes programme used a variety of tools to get as close as possible to the shipwreck and film scenes from inside the sunken vessel. 60 Minutes producer Rich Bonin, said: 'You've got this giant thing that's three football fields long sitting on a slanted mountainside underwater. It's like nothing you've ever seen before.' The footage on the programme shows the former deck where passengers used to sunbath turned on its side while the cruise ship's swimming pool lies half submerged in the sea. Mr Bonin described the scenes on board the sunken Concordia, saying: 'You could see people walking across what used to be the side of the ship - and is now the top of the ship. A crew from 60 Minutes used flying drones, pictured to the top right, with cameras attached to get close up scenes of the ship . The ship deck swimming pool is left half submerged in sea water . 'Topsy turvy': Salvage crew now hang their tools on the upturned deck where guests would have walked . 'And the salvage workers hang their equipment on the very floor where the passengers used to sunbathe or sip their cocktails. Everything is just topsy turvy - and those pictures have never been seen before.' He also described the difficulties in securing the images. 'We covered it with cameras in ways we don't usually,' he explained. 'We had cameras on huge barges that gave us stability so they wouldn't be shaky. 'We crept right up to the edge of the ship and put cameras up against the windows so we could see inside.' Mr Bonin also described how the film crew used hovering drones - similar to 'remote control airplanes people have as kids' - with cameras strapped to them to get just inches from the ship. Tragic: 32 people died when the Costa Concordia crashed off the coast of Tuscany . The crew used numerous methods to gather footage from all over the ship - above and below the water . Mr Bonin added that he was deeply affected by the footage captured. He said: 'You realise that at 1am in January on a freezing cold night, people were slipping down from the top of the deck down into the freezing cold water. 'Everyone knows this was a scene of a tragedy and it affects you. ' Prosecutors have concluded their investigation into the shipwreck of the Costa Concordia cruise liner and are preparing to seek a trial for its captain and seven other people, a magistrate said on Thursday. Captain Francesco Schettino is accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the ship, which was carrying some 4,000 passengers and crew when it hit rocks and capsized after he brought it too close to the island of Giglio. The deck of the ship turned on its side as the salvage operation continues . Salvage crew work next to deck chairs were guests would have sunbathed and drank cocktails . Francesco Verusio, who headed the investigation in the Tuscan port city of Grosseto, said he expected to file a request for an indictment at the end of January. He said Schettino faces up to 20 years in jail. A judge will then decide if there is enough evidence to hold a trial, Reuters reports. The 114,500 ton liner hit rocks after Schettino tried to perform a maneuver known as a 'salute' - an attempt to show passengers the island and islanders the ship. He argues he managed to prevent a worse disaster by steering into shallow waters even closer to shore after the impact to facilitate the rescue operation. Five other members of the crew, including Schetttino's first officer, and three members of a crisis unit set up by Costa to deal with the accident also face indictment and trial.

"By . Simon Duke . UPDATED: . 01:50 EST, 2 August 2011 . Britain's sickly economy was last night facing a jobs bloodbath in the financial sector after HSBC warned that it was slashing 30,000 staff worldwide. Thousands of its UK workers are facing an uncertain future after Britain’s largest bank yesterday unveiled a ‘brutal’ plan to cut nearly one in ten of its global workforce. HSBC will wield the axe despite increasing its profits by 3pc to £7billion between January and June – equivalent to £40million a day. Cuts: Banking giant HSBC will shed 30,000 posts, some of which could go at its UK HQ at Canary Wharf in London (pictured) The cull is likely to be a grim . portent of the pain to come with a raft of Britain’s biggest lenders . expected to shed thousands of staff over the coming months. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and . Lloyds Banking Group could all accelerate cost-cutting plans alongside . results for the first half of 2011 this week. This could spell bad news for the . government’s plans to rein in the deficit, which lean heavily on a . resurgence in tax receipts from big businesses. HSBC has already cut . 5,000 staff around the world since the start of the year, including 700 . in Britain. Yesterday it warned that a further 25,000 will go from a 296,000-strong workforce in a bid to reduce overheads. Its 52,000 UK-based workers will have . to endure months of agony after the bank refused to spell out how many . jobs will be slashed in the UK because of uncertainties surrounding . financial reforms. If the bank implemented a 10 per cent reduction of staff in Britain, it would mean 5,000 people could lose their jobs. Cull: A fresh wave of job losses is poised to sweep the banking sector as HSBC prepares to reveal plans to cull around 10,000 staff worldwide as part of a stringent cost-cutting plan . HSBC has 1,290 branches and around 52,000 staff in the UK. Jobs are being lost across the banking sector, with Credit Suisse recently announcing 2,000 job losses and UBS also warning of cutbacks. Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are already involved in major restructuring programmes which have seen thousands of jobs axed. The latest purge in the industry comes as firms look to offset a sharp drop-off in trading volumes caused by the eurozone crisis and American debt deadlock. HSBC have refused to be drawn on how many staff here would be affected. Chairman Douglas Flint said it was . ‘very difficult’ to predict how many British staff would be jettisoned . until the Independent Commission on Banking delivers its final . recommendations next month. His reticence angered HSBC staff. David Fleming of the Unite union condemned the ‘brutal restructuring’. He said: ‘The employees being hit by these extensive cuts were in no way . responsible for the banking crisis, yet it is these staff many of whom . are low paid, who are having to pay for the bank’s recovery.’ Banks have staged an increasingly . strident lobbying campaign against the ICB’s proposed reforms, which . could force banks to erect firewalls around their High Street operations . in a bid to prevent future taxpayer bailouts. Mr Flint warned that the so-called . ring-fencing plans could ‘constrain the supply of credit to the real . economy and contribute to sub-par economic growth.’ Even before the safeguards come, small firms are finding it difficult to obtain affordable credit from high street banks. HSBC made new loans totalling . £5.6billion to small and medium-term enterprises in the first half. At . the current rate, HSBC will fall short of the £11.7billion SME target . set by the Government. Weak revenue growth in Western Europe . and the UK reflected the tough economic situation in the region, HSBC said . UK revenue fell slightly to £2.82billion from £2.84billion. HSBC said 5,000 of the planned job cuts had already taken place, which included 700 in the UK that were announced in June as a result of regulatory changes to the way financial advice is allowed to be given. Caveat: HSBC's CEO Stuart Gulliver said the 30,000 job losses do not include future expansion plans . HSBC said it is on course to meet its . targets for business lending agreed with the Government under Project . Merlin, having lent £22.7billion, but the group was behind on small firm . lending with £5.6billion advanced in the first six months against a . full year goal of £11.7billion. Mortgage lending rose by 35 per cent . to £6.7billion with HSBC's share of the UK mortgage market at a record . of nearly 11per cent. Shares in the bank rose by 4 per cent as analysts said the figures were an impressive start to the week's bank reporting season. He added that HSBC's global . diversification is not necessarily matched by the other UK banks while . the bad loan figures have reduced impressively. HSBC's announcement kicked off the results season, which is expected to provide a snapshot of a gruelling start to 2011. Barclays, . Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are all also expected . to reveal a drop in profits in their interim updates over the coming . week. The main focus is . likely to be on progress with cost-cutting after boss Stuart Gulliver . unveiled a multi-billion dollar savings programme earlier this year . which will cut back on retail operations in some parts of the world and . instead focus on fast growing markets in Mexico and Turkey. It has already seen an announcement . today that HSBC will sell just under half of its 470 retail banking . branches in the U.S. to First Niagara Bank for around $1 billion. Most of the 195 branches to be sold are in New York Upstate region, while six are in Connecticut. Six others are in New York State - four in northern Westchester County, and two in Putnam County. The payment protection insurance . mis-selling scandal; planned ring-fencing of retail banking operations . as proposed by the Independent Commission on Banking; and a volatile . global economic climate have all affected the accounts of the four . lenders. Taxpayer-backed . Lloyds and RBS have seen their shares plunge 30 per cent and 17 per cent . respectively in the last six months alone, while Barclays' shares have . plummeted 26 per cent and HSBC has lost 14 per cent. Barclays, . which reports tomorrow, is expected to reveal a 24 per cent drop in . reported profits to £1.8 billion, according to broker Seymour Pierce. Taxpayer-backed . Lloyds Banking Group is expected to report pre-tax profits of £1 . billion on Thursday, a steep reduction on the £1.6 billion reported a . year earlier. Royal Bank of . Scotland closes the week with its results on Friday, which are expected . to reveal £611 million in reported profits, down 19 per cent on the . previous year, Seymour Pierce said.

"By . Amanda Cable . PUBLISHED: . 18:02 EST, 17 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:21 EST, 18 March 2013 . At 51 years old, Linda Barker is still a svelte size 10 . A sporty blonde giggles as Barbie-like extensions are woven into her hair. After just an hour in make-up - most models require at least double that to be 'camera ready' - she dons a terrifyingly small crop top to reveal her piece de resistance; that washboard stomach. The woman in question is no teenage starlet, however. It's Splash! star Linda Barker, and those extraordinary abs are 51 years old. 'I'd never have had the confidence to show off my midriff in my 20s,' says mother-of-one Linda, patting her stomach proudly. 'I had the body - but I didn't have that confidence and  go-get-it attitude that comes with age.' The TV presenter's figure (she's 5ft 7in and a size 10) became the talking point of the nation when she appeared on ITV's prime-time Saturday night show last month, plunging head-first from the high diving board with a host of other celebrities, under the tutelage of Olympic athlete Tom Daley. But she hadn't originally planned to wear the itsy-bitsy bikinis that caused so much public consternation. Instead, she'd brought along a black running vest and bikini bottoms, only to have the look vetoed by a member of the wardrobe department. 'One of the girls came over and said: ""You've got to wear a bikini!"" I said: ""Really? Do you think it'll look all right?"" And she said: ""I think it will be fabulous!"" So I thought I'd go for it.' Incredibly, her body - clad in those skimpy rhinestone bikinis - held its own next to Daley's athletic 18-year-old frame. 'Wearing a bikini on national TV at the age of 51 is the last thing I thought I'd be doing,' she laughs. But then fiftysomething mums no longer feel they have to hide their bodies away in shapeless frumpy clothes. Last week, a survey revealed that 50 is the age most women said they felt happiest, attributing it to having more sex, enjoying better relationships and being more physically active than their younger counterparts. All reasons why Linda calls herself and her contemporaries 'the ageless generation'. 'Turning 50 has been a liberation,' says Linda. 'I stood in front of the mirror on the morning of my birthday and took a long, hard look at my reflection. I'd done the same thing a decade earlier - but, as a 50-year-old, I felt so much better about myself. 'Of course, there were more lines and wrinkles than when I turned 40, but they felt less important. At 50, you lose those worries and fears about growing older. My generation refuse to be defined by their date of birth. 'Even 20 years ago, women turning 50 almost felt ashamed. That's why everyone lied so desperately about their ages - particularly celebrities. You had stars who were clearly well into their late 40s still pretending to be frivolous thirtysomethings. 'There was a real taboo about ageing then, a feeling that the only thing you could do was shop in the nylon trouser and baggy sweater section of M&S and wear comfortable Velcro-fastening shoes. 'Now, the way women think and dress has been revolutionised. I mean, Helen Mirren dyed her hair pink recently! I can't think of a better person who illustrates this new ""bring it on"" attitude.' Born in Yorkshire, Linda is a farmer's . daughter and one of five children. She studied fine art in Surrey, . where she met and dated Chris, a photographer. After graduating, Linda moved back to the countryside and worked as an air hostess before meeting Chris again, aged 26. Three years later, in 1992, the couple married and Linda's television career began 18 months afterwards. Linda with her husband Chris Short, left, and proudly showing off her flat stomach and size 10 frame, right . Programmes . such as Home Front and Changing Rooms cemented her reputation as an . interior design expert, but it wasn't until her bikini-clad appearance . on reality show I'm A Celebrity . . . in 2003 that Linda was truly . propelled into the public eye. In a Mintel survey, three-quarters of women said they felt most insecure about wobbly stomachs . She . was castigated for appearing 'fame hungry' after posing naked for . glossy magazines - her modesty barely spared by strategically folded . arms. Former colleagues came out of the woodwork and accused her of having such grasping ambition she underwent a complete makeover in a bid for fame. 'Back then she was quite chunky - a good few stone heavier than she is now,' a former colleague said at the time. 'She always used to wear baggy tops and T-shirts. Her hair was cut into a plain bob, and she hardly ever wore make-up.' Linda vehemently dismisses the claims and says she always took care of her appearance. 'Looking back to my 20s, I wasn't frumpy or overweight, but I'm sure there were some real fashion disasters. I was never heavy when I was younger, but I used to yo-yo in weight by several pounds if I'd over-indulged. I've learned over the years to keep an eye on my exercise and diet.' Her daughter Jessica, 20, has left home for university and Linda believes life is harder for her daughter's generation than it is for hers. Linda Barker, aged 20, when she said she never felt confident enough to show her midriff, despite having a typically good body . She says: 'The pressure on Jessica and her contemporaries to look a certain way is horrendous. Whereas my peers are too old to be unduly influenced, teenagers and twentysomethings have an unprecedented amount of expectation to live up to some ideal body shape. 'They are being bombarded with the wrong images - size-zero models with figures you have to starve yourself to achieve, for example, and all these plastic-fantastic fake celebrity looks. 'TV programmes such as 10 Years Younger place a huge emphasis on looks, too. There's little about confidence, kindness or self-worth. The message is clear - be judged on your body shape and how you look.' But it has to be said, Linda - who shops at Topshop, Zara and Mango ('the same places as my daughter') - is partly making a living by trading on her good looks. To these ends, the presenter will soon be seen in a campaign targeting older women for lingerie firm Playtex. Linda hugs Phil Tufnell on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here . So just how does Linda manage to maintain those abs and stay a neat size ten? 'I don't actually weigh myself or diet,' she says. 'But I have a favourite pair of tight jeans and when they don't do up, I'll spend a few days drinking juices and eating more healthily. 'I'm lucky because my body pinged back into shape after having Jessica in my 30s. As the years have gone on, I've had to work harder to maintain my shape. 'I do yoga whenever I can - at least three times a week - which also helps me to relax, and I have a personal trainer who I see twice a week for an hour each time.' (Linda also cycles a ten-mile round-trip to and from training sessions.) 'I love the rush I get after exercising,' she says. 'I guess you could say I'm addicted. But there are worse things to be hooked on!' The Changing Rooms team, from left, Llewelyn-Bowen, 'Handy' Andy Kane, Linda Barker, Carol Smillie, Graham Wynne and Anna Ryder Richardson . Although for anyone envying Linda's abs, she has some bad news. 'There's no hidden secret to getting my stomach,' she says. 'Just go to the gym and work hard.' Linda adds: 'I plan to still wear sexy, fashionable clothes when I'm 80. My mother died aged 76 from heart disease and my 86-year-old dad is wheelchair-bound and has a raft of health problems including dementia, so he lives in a care home. 'Seeing my parents suffer from illness has been my main motivation for staying in shape. I don't want to get ill.' But Linda is adamant she'd never consider cosmetic surgery. Linda showing her designs to some participants on Channel 4's Changing Rooms . 'My husband Chris is, like me, horrified by older women who have had things ""done"". 'I've stood next to women who have had a lot of cosmetic work -there are a fair few of them in showbusiness - and it makes me recoil. I can't bear anything fake - even false nails - and so I'd rather have wrinkles than look frozen in time. 'Occasionally I do look in the mirror and see how flat-chested I am and think for a moment: ""Oh, it would be nice to have a bit of a plump up."" 'I have this fantasy of myself wearing a long, plunging dress and all eyes are on my cleavage. But the reality is breast enlargement is major surgery involving anaesthetic, stitches and drips. 'Also, I don't want to be walking around in my dotage with the ridiculous breasts of a 22-year-old. So in those moments of self-doubt, I simply stick on some nice underwear and pop in the chicken fillets for a bit of an extra lift.' Linda's only real nod to her age is buying expensive anti-ageing moisturisers and having a facial every month. 'The fact I'm confident enough to be photographed in a crop top at my age shows how much women's attitudes have changed,' she explains. 'For us, growing older is no longer a fear, it's a celebration.' Linda Barker is an ambassador for lovetolearn.co.uk .

Deloitte, the administrators brought in to run the music chain last week, had initially ruled the cards were worthless. The climbdown brings good news to around 350,000 people, many of whom were given the vouchers for Christmas. Struggling: HMV announced it would stop accepting gift cards after going into administration last week, but has now made a U-turn and will honour them from Tuesday . The entertainment chain came under . fire from disappointed customers when it announced last week that . millions of pounds of gift cards were now worthless as it seeks to . restructure its debts and cut costs. But . from tomorrow stores will begin accepting the cards once more, a move . which could help keep customers on side as the firm continues to . struggle. The High Street giant went into administration under Deloitte last week, putting more than 4,000 jobs at risk after years of suffering from the effects of digital downloads and online retailers. The firm is believed to have attracted interest from a restructuring specialist which has drawn the support of record labels keen to avoid being at the mercy of the likes of Amazon, Apple and Tesco. Around £10million worth of gift cards were set to become completely worthless as their holders became unsecured creditors, who are typically the last people to be repaid during bankruptcy proceedings. However, Deloitte announced today that the cards would be honoured during the period of administration, starting on Tuesday. They also confirmed that the money raised from charity records such as a single intended to help victims of the Hillsborough disaster would be paid out in full. Warnings: These posters were seen in HMV stores in Liverpool (left) and Oxford (right) 'The ability of Administrators to honour gift vouchers will depend on the specific circumstances of each case,' joint administrator Nick Edwards said in a statement. 'Since our appointment as Joint Administrators on Tuesday afternoon, we have been urgently assessing the Companies’ financial position. 'I am pleased to confirm that, having concluded this assessment, we are able to honour gift cards.  I can also confirm that all money raised by HMV for various charities will be paid in full. 'We recognise that both of these matters have caused concern for individuals and organisations affected and are pleased to have reached a positive outcome.' Fears that consumers would lose out on gift vouchers and cards last week prompted experts to call for an urgent change in the rules. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said it was 'outrageous' that consumers were left out of pocket when retailers refused to honour gift vouchers. In trouble: Browsing in record shops has been hit by the rise of online shopping and downloads . Deja vu: The gift card U-turn is similar to what happened at Comet before it closed last year . Customers are likely to rush to . redeem their cards as quickly as possible in case the firm goes out of . business or changes its mind once again. The turnaround is reminiscent of Deloitte's takeover of electrics retailer Comet last year. On that occasion, the company stopped accepting gift cards when it went into administration, only to reverse the decision two days later. Comet shut down entirely in December, swiftly followed by Jessops, another company to be hit hard by the rise of digital media. The day after HMV entered administration, video rental chain Blockbuster followed suit, adding to the economic carnage on the High Street. However, HMV is widely expected to be taken over by a new owner soon, with Hilco - which already owns HMV Canada - thought to be in the forefront of possible buyers. Music labels and film studios are considering propping the company up by easing credit terms over fears the disappearance of the UK's only chain of record shops would lead to a collapse in CD and DVD sales. Even if the company is bought, dozens of its stores are likely to be closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs.

A two-year-old boy who was left fighting for his life after a gust of wind from Hurricane Sandy caused a tree limb to fall and hit his head has just undergone emergency surgery. Tripp Halstead, from Georgia, has been hospitalized since the October 29 incident after sustaining a brain injury which left him in a medically induced coma. His family posted on his Facebook page today: 'Please pray pray pray. They are taking him in for emergency surgery to remove the shunt and the pump. 'Tripp has bacterial meningitis, which is very life threatening. Words can’t describe what we are feeling except total heartbreak.' Fighting for his life: Both sides of two-year-old Tripp Halstead's brain were injured when a large branch was blown off a tree and hit him in the head . When he was rushed into Children’s . Healthcare of Atlanta on the day of the incident, he had emergency . surgery to relive swelling around his brain from where the ten-foot tree . branch struck him on the head. Tripp’s favorite toy, Lightning McQueen, is in his hand as he remains unconscious. A family friend set up a Facebook for Tripp's parents, Bill and Stacy Halstead, who have been posting updates on their son's condition and asking people to pray and donate money for his recovery. The family said they have been overwhelmed with support from thousands of well-wishers, many of them strangers who have heard about Tripp’s plight from media reports, according to Atlanta Journal Constitution. After the accident, the toddler's father, Bill Halstead, wrote that doctors gave them sobering news. 'His injury is across both sides of the brain which makes it much worse. It is still far too early to know what the outcome will be or what the lasting damage could be,' the message read. Bubbly: Tripp was playing outside with his classmates when the branch came from nowhere and struck him down . Gratitude: Tripp's parents Bill and Stacy Halstead (pictured) have thanked people for their continued support in their time of need . Scene: The accident happened while Tripp was enjoying his recess with friends at the Cribs To Crayons daycare center . 'His swelling is back up and his drainage tube is having problems,' the post said in part. 'Sounds like today is going to be the most trying day so far so please continue to pray. We still need a miracle.' The boy's mother, Stacy Halstead, called her son a miracle baby, explaining to WSB-TV that she and her husband had struggled for a long time to conceive until finally she became pregnant with Tripp, their one and only child. On October 29, tragedy struck when the toddler was playing at around 11.30am outside the Cribs and Crayons day care center, CBS Atlanta reported. A strong gust of wind caused a tree limb to fall, hitting the little boy in the neck and head. Employees from the center rushed to his aid and administered CPR, but the damage had been done. Miracle baby: Tripp's parents Bill and Stacy said they struggled for some time before having their only son . Heavy: A strong gust of wind ripped the branch from the tree before it landed on Tripp . Since the accident, the boy's family have been on a roller coaster ride, going from positive signs, like a brief reduction in pressure around his brain, to serious complications, among them problems with his breathing. On Friday afternoon, a desperate plea appeared on the family's Faceboook page asking for prayers.

Mo Farah arrived in London aged eight from Somalia, where he was born, and barely spoke a word of English. He was had grown up in the African country as it descended into devastating civil war but was bale to flee to the UK. He went to Feltham Community College, London, where his talent was spotted and nurtured by PE teacher Alan Watkinson. His first major title came at the European Athletics Junior Championship in 2001 in the 5,000m. Farah won the European Championship gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m in 2010 in Barcelona, and a week later became the first British man to run under 13 minutes in the 5,000m. He soon became the first British man to win gold in the 5,000m at the World Championships in Daegu in 2011, when he smashed the European record. Farah secured his place in history last summer in London last summer, becoming the first British man to win Olympic gold in the 10,000m, and one of only five people to also win gold in the 5,000m. Britain's most successful distance runner of all time was awarded a CBE in the New Year's Honours list and has expressed his desire to move into marathon running. Fellow .

She has spoken out in reaction to the current Ohio rape case which has thrust her hometown onto the national stage.

Ordeal: Actress and singer Traci Lords revealed to Piers Morgan on Thursday that she was raped in her hometown of Steubenville when she was just ten years old . Lords told Morgan that there is a sickness in the eastern Ohio city . Miss Lords went onto admit that she was initially reluctant to respond to fans’ tweets asking her to comment on the rape case in which two high school players stand accused of sexually assaulting an intoxicated 16-year-old girl. She said: ‘People come after you and the last thing I wanted was the, “Look at this slut talking about that slut thing.” But I just couldn’t stay silent.’ The actress said watching the trial of Trent Mays, 16, and 17-year-old Ma’lik Richmond had ‘affected her so deeply’ and brought the experiences of her childhood back in vivid detail. Miss Lords' attacker was 14 years old. She has written a song entitled Stupidville to channel the anger she . felt at seeing images of the 16-year-old girl being ‘carried like a pig’.

Notorious: Miss Lords, aged 27, at Club Expo in New York City . Miss Lords added: ‘It’s what all the locals in Steubenville Ohio used to call Steubenville.’ She . characterized her hometown – a city that proudly boasts of her as its . daughter along with its other musical claim to fame, Dean Martin – as a . place where there is, ‘a lot of alcohol and a lack of regard for young . women’. Asked by Piers . Morgan if young men are brought up to be disrespectful to young women in . the Ohio town, Lord responded simply. ‘I think so, yes. I do think so.’ High school football players Trent Mays, 16, and 17-year-old Ma’lik Richmond are accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl in a case that has scandalized America. Mays and Richmond allegedly twice digitally penetrated the girl - described as 'too impaired to say no' - and subjected her to 'degradation, humiliation and violation' including stripping her naked. Revealing all: Traci Lords wrote a memoir Underneath It All about facing sexual abuse and her underage experiences in the porn industry. Right, in 2004 with husband Jeff Lee . Reinvention: Traci Lords, pictured in 1991, has diversified after a career in porn and is now a successful actress, singer and author . Traci Lords was born Nora Louise Kuzma on May 7, 1968 in Steubenville, Ohio to parents Louis and Patricia. At just ten years old, she was raped by a teenage boy in the town. Traci . fled her violent, alcoholic father with her mother and three sisters . when she was 12 years old, moving to Lawndale, California. She . was molested by her mother's cocaine-dealing new boyfriend Roger. At . the age of 15, she dropped out of high school to move in with him after . he split up with her mother. Roger arranged Traci's first nude photo shoot, posing as her stepfather. She began working as a porn actress using a fake driver's license that said she was 20 years old.

The investigation cost the adult film industry millions of dollars as they had to destroy thousands of her tape and magazines or face charges of trafficking in child pornography. The FBI say that Lords was an underage victim of an exploitative porn industry which forced her to do drugs. However some adult film stars including Ron Jeremy claim that Lords was aware of what she was doing and they never witnessed her using drugs. Lords was never charged with a crime and began to reinvent herself, away from the porn industry. She diversified her career becoming a TV and B-Movie actress. She most famously starred opposite Johnny Depp in the John Waters film Cry Baby. More recently, she has appeared in several popular mainstream films including 'Zack and Miri Make a Porno' starring Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks. Lords is also successful in the music industry working with British bands the Manic Street Preachers and Jesus Jones.

But when it came to success, two conmen in Australia were very much on the money – £20million of it, to be precise. The tricksters stole the astonishing sum from a casino with nothing more complicated than a £3 earpiece and a computer. The Crown casino in Melbourne is said to have lost $32million in a hi-tech heist . Bosses believe that a helper gained remote access to the venue's security camera and were then able to tell the high roller how to bet based on other players' hands of cards . They used the building’s own security cameras to pull off one of the biggest-known casino stings ever. And while it lacked the pyrotechnics of heist film Ocean’s Eleven, it was planned just as carefully. The fake punter, who is not thought . to be Australian, had staked out the Crown Casino in Melbourne, where he . was known to staff as a ‘whale’ – a gambler who bets huge sums. On the night of the sting he was allowed much sought-after access to the casino’s VIP high rollers’ room. The player is believed to have left Australia and returned home while a member of staff assigned to VIPs has been sacked . After playing just eight hands of . poker he scooped the table and made a fortune – courtesy of the casino’s . own high-tech security cameras, which can watch every hand held by a . gambler and record every card played. As usual, the images were carefully monitored in a separate room, and nothing untoward was spotted. But the gambler’s seemingly . telepathic skill – and his huge win – aroused suspicion, and casino . bosses called in security experts. Meanwhile, the man was allowed to . cash his winnings and return to his £1,000-a-night quarters on the . executive floors of the Crown Towers, where he was staying with his . family. Staff soon discovered that remote access to the VIP room’s security system ‘had been given to an unauthorised person’. The conman’s partner was watching . images from the hidden cameras monitoring the gaming table, and telling . him what hands the other players were holding via his earpiece. Staff confronted the man in the middle of the night, and ordered him and his family out of the building. The casino claims he has left the . country – but refuses to reveal why the foreign gambler was allowed to . go with his illegal winnings. Police said no official complaint had been . made. According to reports, he has been banned from the casino, and a member of staff who looked after VIP guests has been sacked. The heist has been compared to 2001 film Ocean's Eleven, starring George Clooney, left, and Brad Pitt . Tips: In the Hollywood comedy-crime caper film the crew of conmen also relied on infiltrating the security system at the Bellagio casino to fool the manager Terry Benedict played by Andy Garcia . A spokesman claimed the casino was confident of recovering a significant portion of the stolen money. Barron Stringfellow, a US-based . security consultant, said: ‘The problem with casinos is that they think . they’re unbeatable but we see over and over again that they’re not. It’s . very easy to intercept the signal [of the security cameras] from many . casinos that don’t take proper precautions.' Ocean’s . Eleven was released in 2001.

A teenager obsessed with designer labels was given a birthday cake in the shape of a Louis Vuitton handbag after she helped steal £150,000 from a string of bank accounts, a court heard. Aamna Aliani, 18, bought Christian Louboutin shoes, Dolce & Gabbana clothes and dozens of handbags on an incredible spending spree. The teenager, together with accomplices Derrick Mensah, 20, and David Kwarteng, 27, hijacked confidential credit and debit card details from 22 Lloyds TSB customers before they hit the shops. Jailed: Aamna Aliana (left) was one of a trio of fraudsters who splashed out on a wardrobe-full of designer clothing after siphoning off almost £150,000 from a string of bank accounts. Aamna Aliana, 18, is also pictured with Derek Mensah, 20, outside Southwark Crown Court . Police found this picture of Aamna Aliani's birthday cake, in the shape of a Louis Vuitton bag, on a mobile phone . They blew tens of thousands of pounds at Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada stores in London's exclusive Mayfair. Thousands of pounds in cash were also withdrawn from bank branches in Hammersmith, west London; High Road and Cranbrook Road in Ilford, Essex; East Gate, Harlow; Wood Green, north London; and Knightsbridge, southwest London. Aliani also used the cash to purchase a gym membership from Fitness First for £534 while Mensah bought £200 gift vouchers from John Lewis, Southwark Crown Court heard. The two month-long scam unravelled on May 14, 2011, when police became suspicious after spotting Kwatreng waiting in a BMW for Aliani, while she was shopping at Louis Vuitton in central London's Conduit Street. Aliani had purchased two designer bags worth £1,130 and also had a further £860 in cash on her. Five envelopes in the BMW were stuffed full with a total of £12,800 while the car boot was also heaving with trendy clothing. Prosecutor Nicholas Mather said the total loss was in the region of £144,000.

'In short this case involves the taking over of individuals' bank accounts and the use of the credit and debit cards that are attached to those accounts. 'A memory stick was found on Kwatreng which was full of financial information relating to a number of different bank accounts. 'The information included dates of birth and addresses and confidential data such as telephone banking passwords. 'Someone has had access using the information on the memory stick to 22 individuals' bank accounts. 'The method used is identical - the bank would be telephoned and the (account holder's) address would be changed to one of two addresses in Harlow, Essex. 'The bank would then be informed that the card was damaged and a new card sent out to the false address.

'The card would then be used either to make purchases of luxury goods or withdraw money. 'The . total loss from compromised cards, whoever was responsible, whether it . was one of the defendants or others, is something in the region of . £144,000. 'There is also the enormous inconvenience to the card holders and the banks.' When . police arrested the gang they found pictures of designer clothes, wads . of cash and the handbag birthday cake which had been taken on their . mobile phones. Aliani, who . was just 16 at the time of the scam, and Mensah were each sentenced to a . year in prison, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to . complete 240 hours unpaid work. Kwarteng, . who has previous convictions including handling stolen goods, was . immediately jailed for one year. Relatives in the public gallery wept as . the sentence was passed. Mr Justice Nicol said: 'All three of . you were involved in the use of replacement bank cards which the banks . had been talked into sending to a false address. 'The cards were then used to withdraw cash or buy expensive items of clothing.' Addressing Kwatreng, the judge said: 'Your offending was part of a professional operation but it was only over two days. 'The offence of possessing criminal property is intended to discourage the criminal activity which generates such property.' Mr Justice Nicol told Aliani: 'Your role was the most serious of the three defendants and you used the cards most extensively, in total spending £22,700. 'It's clear you have had some difficulties in your family background and the lure of the lifestyle which this offending held or appeared to promise obviously proved to be too much.' James McCrindell, for Aliani, said: 'This is someone who can be punished in the community. The focus can still be in respect of rehabilitation rather than sentence. 'At the start of her criminal conduct she was just 16, turning 17 when she was arrested. She is now 18 and has looked back on her conduct and realises she went the wrong way. 'She recognises and accepts responsibility for her offending and says she only has herself to blame. She is a good young person who, notwithstanding disadvantages, has always tried to do the right thing.' Jeremy Ornstin, defending Kwatreng, said grew up in a 'challenging environment' but 'against the odds' is now embarking on a degree at the University of Hertfordshire. Ray Hedlam, for Mensah, urged the judge to take a merciful course. Aliani, of south Tottenham, north London, admitted 12 counts of fraud and possession of criminal property. Mensah, of Newington Green, Stoke Newington, north London, admitted four counts of fraud.

The vase sold for 100 times its estimated value after a telephone bidder in China took an interest in it . A small Chinese vase that was valued at £10,000 to £15,000 has today sold at auction - for almost £1 million. The extremely rare 18th Century ornament, made for a Chinese emperor, was brought to Britain by the seller’s family more than a century ago. Despite it standing just 20cm (eight inches) high, an anonymous telephone buyer from China paid around 100 times its estimated value when it went under the hammer at Tennants’ auction rooms in Leyburn, North Yorkshire today. Tennants’ associate director, Nigel Smith said the blue and white bottle vase, made for the Qianlong Emperor around 1730, was put up for sale by an academic who lives in Oxford. He said its auction room success was down to its rarity and exclusivity as very few were ever produced. Mr Smith added: 'It really is a museum-quality piece and these things very rarely come on the market. 'It’s come down through the family - one of their relatives was a diplomat in China in the 1880s and was given it as a gift.' He said the unnamed owner had contacted auctioneers after learning that a similar item had sold for £2.6 million last year. Mr Smith said he was shocked at the £950,000 it made during today’s Spring Fine Art Sale, adding: 'Despite the low valuation, we expected it to fetch in excess of half a million but we were very pleased with the result. I haven’t spoken to the vendor but I expect he’s rather happy too.' The seller’s grandmother, Lady Ethel Margaret Stronge, left the vase to his mother Mrs Rose Ethel Richardson of Tynan Abbey, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, who gave it to her son. Tennants were inundated with requests from people with Chinese vases after they sold one for £3million in November last year . Lady Ethel Margaret married Sir James Henry Stronge who joined the diplomatic service in London in 1879 and served in Peking in the same year. He went on to serve in the Supreme Court in Shanghai in 1885 before working in Central America from 1897 to 1907. The seller was one of many people who sent Tennants pictures of heirlooms after a slightly older Chinese vase made £2.6m in a Tennants sale in November, the auction house said. A vase valued at just £20,000 was sold for almost £3million at the same auction house . The blue and white bottle vase had been kept in a house in North Yorkshire for 45 years and the owner had no idea it was valuable. But the antique was discovered by Rodney Tennant, from Tennants Auctioneers, during a routine house call to value the contents and it sold to a bidder in Hong Kong. In November a 300-year-old blue and white vase was bought by an unnamed Chinese telephone bidder based in Hong Kong from the same auction house. The 40cm high bottle-shaped vase, bearing the mark of 18th century Emperor Yongzheng, was conservatively estimated at £20,000-£30,000.But word quickly spread around the antiques world and collectors and dealers from China were prominent in the crowded saleroom as the bidding quickly soared. It was knocked down for £2.6 million, which with buyer’s premium pushed the final price to just over £3 million. In 2010 a Chinese vase found in the UK was sold for £53 million. Tony Johnson, 54, from the Isle of Wight, sold the artifact from the 1740 Qing dynasty to billionaire Chinese property developer Wang Jianlin. It was said to have been brought back from China by an ‘adventurous uncle’ after being stolen from an imperial palace by British troops during the 19th Century Opium Wars. The vase was then at the centre of a legal row between the auction house and Wang Jianlin, and 18 months after the sale Johnson has still not received a penny from the sale.","The 18th Century vase was bought by an unnamed bidder from China .

"BP has asked a judge to temporarily halt 'economic loss' based payments . The compensation settlement is one of the biggest in US history with $7.8bn set aside . The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig killed 11 workers and ruptured a deep-sea well head which took 84 days to seal . Third anniversary of the spill is one month away . PUBLISHED: . 13:35 EST, 16 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:38 EST, 16 March 2013 . BP has launched an appeal against ""fictitious"" and ""absurd"" oil spill compensation payouts and has asked a judge to temporarily halt the payments being made to businesses on an 'economic loss' basis. In a New Orleans court filing, BP gave examples of companies in industries far away from the spill and completely unconnected with the coastline that enjoyed bigger profits during the year of the spill in 2010 and yet still received millions in compensation. The British oil and gas group, which has already sold a substantial part of its business to pay out compensation and fines as a result of the disaster, said it could be 'irreparably harmed' by the payouts because they could cost it 'billions' more than it budgeted for when it agreed to a settlement in April 2012. Compensation: Deepwater Horizon, off Louisiana in Aprill 2010 - the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . It reopens a part of the saga that appeared to have been settled almost a year ago when BP agreed terms on economic, property and medical compensation for more than 100,000 individuals and businesses who had filed a class action suit. At the time of the settlement, BP estimated the bill would be $7.8 billion - already making it one of the biggest settlements of its kind in U.S. history. The actual amount is uncapped, and dependent on decisions made by Patrick Juneau, a lawyer from Louisiana who administers the payments under a complex set of rules set out by the agreement. Compensation: BP has already sold a substantial part of its business to pay compensation and fines resulting from the disaster and there is likely to be more to come . As the payments started to flow out, BP realized that the funds it had set aside would be insufficient. At first, it added more, reaching $8.5 billion by the end of 2012, while complaining that the payments to businesses were too generous and the terms of the settlement were being misinterpreted. The April 2010 spill happened when the Macondo well ruptured and the Deepwater Horizon rig that was working on it exploded and sank. The accident killed 11 men and spouted 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in the United States' worst offshore oil spill. Last year BP agreed to pay compensation to around 100,000 people and companies - including fishermen and restaurant owners - who claimed the oil spill had harmed their livelihoods or their health. In its filing, among the examples BP . offered of 'absurd' claims, the British company referred to a $21 . million payment made to a rice mill in Louisiana situated some 40 miles . from the coast that earned more revenue than in spill year of 2010 than . in the previous three years. It . also cited a $9.7 million recompense for a highway, street and bridge . construction company in northern Alabama, almost 200 miles from the . Gulf, and which does no business in the region, and for which 2010 was . its best year on record. Not adding up: BP set aside $42 billion to deal with compensation claims from businesses that were affected but it says many are simply ""fictitious"" and ""absurd"" BP also referred to a digital printing business and a law firm that had been compensated despite strong profits. Claimants can demonstrate a loss by choosing to compare 'any consecutive three months from 2010' with 'a large combination of months going back to January 2007.' The company had set aside $42 billion to pay compensation claims - equivalent to about 30 percent of its stock market value. It has also sold assets worth $38 billion in order the to finance the  compensation, clean-ups and fines. The company has already promised to pay $37 billion but billions more could be piled on in economic damage claims from Gulf Coast states despite having already agreed in 2012 to pay $4.5bn to settle criminal charges.","BP has asked a judge to temporarily halt 'economic loss' based payments .

Killed in crash: Wallis 'Wally' Watson, 66, who died along with his son Kevin Watson, 30, of Pompano Beach and Steven Waller, 65, of Deerfield Beach . Serious damage: A small plane crashed into a warehouse and landed in the parking lot killing all three passengers . Fatal: The plane first crashed into a warehouse and then landed in the parking lot but the flames were seen for miles . Rubble: The crash occurred in Fort Lauderdale around 4.30pm on Friday and it took a while for firemen to control the flames . The plane, a two-engine turboprop, can carry a crew of two and four to six passengers. Incredibly, there were no reported casualties on the ground. Federal officials say the plane suffered a mechanical problem and lost power shortly after takeoff. Witnesses saw the Piper Cheyenne turboprop make a steep right turn in an apparent attempt to return to the airport before plunging into an impound parking lot, bursting into flames, setting numerous cars and a boat on fire. Although a mechanical malfunction appears to be the focus of their investigation, federal air safety investigators on Saturday said they will probe every aspect of the flight, including the pilot’s experience and the plane’s maintenance history. They also will listen to tapes of the pilot’s emergency call to the control tower just before the crash, about 4:15 p.m. on Friday. Kevin Watson, 30, one of three men who died in a plane crash yesterday in Fort Lauderdale . Dangerous: Police kept a large area surrounding the fire blocked off as emergency workers determined what was the best way to approach the wreckage of the small passenger jet . Ignition: The crash sparked an even bigger fire in the parking lot . On Saturday, investigators sifted through the mangled wreckage, looking for clues. The plane’s fuselage was completely destroyed and parts, including the propellers, were strewn around the parking lot. A recovery truck was brought in to lift burned cars away from the impact area. The wreckage is expected to be trucked to a nearby hangar for further inspection. The NTSB plans to release a preliminary accident report in about a week, a more detailed report in six to eight months and make a final “probable cause” ruling in about 18 months. 'Our focus so far today has been documenting the aircraft on scene to the point where we can get it recovered off-site to look at it further,' Luke Schiada, a senior air safety investigator with the NTSB, said at the crash site Saturday. 'We will continue to do that the rest of the day. We will also be gathering information on the pilot, his experience, his type of experience, medical certification, things like that.' What remains: The crash and fire seems to have left the structure of the plane in a heap of burning ash as only the burnt rubble of the 12 damaged cars remain . Small: The plane that crashed was a a Piper Navajo (like the one pictured) which can hold up to six people but there were only three passengers on board at the time of the crash . Yesterday, those who were nearby were telling of their experiences: 'The whole building shook. It (felt) like somebody crashed into the building,' said Chris Jewett who was . working in an office building across the street from the point of . impact. 'Three of four (parked vehicles) actually blew up, the rest caught on fire,' he told CNN. Television . images showed about eight cars in a corner that were burned out shells, . a smoldering heap covered in foam spread by firefighters on the scene. A storage facility and an indoor go-kart track are among the businesses listed nearby. The airport serves smaller planes rather than the larger commercial flights at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The crash happened at the start of rush hour alongside Interstate 95, the major north-south route along Florida's Atlantic coast.

A man suspended from a Detroit-area university after writing about his attraction to teachers in a class journal sued the school Friday for $2.2 million and four lost credits, claiming his free-speech rights were violated. Joseph Corlett, 57, a home builder who enrolled in college because of the weak economy, said he was an A-student in a writing class at Oakland University in Rochester until he submitted a journal in 2011 titled 'Hot For Teacher,' the name of a song by the rock band Van Halen. Corlett compared his female instructor to Ginger, a sultry movie starlet character on the 1960s TV show 'Gilligan's Island.' Angry: Joseph Corlett, 56, is fuming after Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, kicked him off the writing and rhetoric course and the campus . He feared being distracted and said, 'I'll never learn a thing.' He said another teacher who was pregnant was 'hot, and not just from baking the bun in her oven.' The teacher informed an Oakland dean after reading the journal for the first time. Officials said Corlett's writings violated a policy against intimidation or harassment and last year barred him for three terms, through winter 2013. The university said he must undergo counseling if he wants to return as a student. In an interview, Corlett, who now lives in Sarasota, Florida, said he's fighting for his civil rights. ‘When you get past the titillation, you've got to look into what's really going on here,’ he said. ‘It's academic freedom or no academic freedom. We're all collectively dumbed when speech is suppressed or challenged.’ Oakland spokesman David Groves said the school doesn't comment on lawsuits. Corlett said students in the English 380 class were told to write ‘raw things, a personal diary that maybe we wouldn't want anyone to read.’ He said the teacher had no objection to his earlier work, which earned an A, an essay about accidentally seeing women's breasts. ‘There is no constitutional protection against being offended,’ Corlett said. ‘And while I am sympathetic to anyone's feelings, I repeatedly asked for instruction. I was repeatedly told there were no topics that were out of bounds.’ Corlett was removed from the writing class by two police officers after an Oakland administrator forgot to tell him that he was barred from attending while his status as a student was under review. Attorney Alari Adams said Corlett is seeking $2.2 million for mental anguish and the embarrassment of being kicked out of school. Corlett enrolled full-time at Oakland in 2011 after earning an associate degree from Oakland Community College. He said he needs 40 credit hours for a bachelor's degree. ‘The real issue is the First Amendment,’ Mr Corlett previously said. ‘It's about academic freedom and about due process. ‘I asked her on multiple occasions if there were topical restrictions on the day books - and on every occasion she told me no,’ he told ABC News. His case was taken up by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education after he was banned from campus and told to undergo counseling. The journal in which he wrote the piece was labelled as a ‘place for a writer to try out ideas and record impressions and observations’. Teacher: The countertop refinisher based the assignment about Pamela Mitzelfeld, 49, pictured, on the 1984 song Hot for Teacher by rock band Van Halen . The idea was that uncensored writings and . thoughts in the journal, which he handed in November, could be used to . create proper essays. 'I asked her on multiple occasions if there were topical restrictions on the daybooks, and on every occasion she told me no' Joseph Corlett . He compared one teacher in another entry to Ginger Grant, a character played by actress Tina Louise in 1960s TV comedy series Gilligan's Island. Mr Corlett met with university officials in December and they allegedly told him last month he would be arrested if he set foot on the campus. He was found guilty of intimidation by university officials at a hearing but a sexual harassment charge was dropped, reported ABC News. Decision: Mr Corlett was found guilty of intimidation by university officials in Rochester, Michigan, at a hearing but a sexual harassment charge was dropped . Couple: Mr Cortlett is pictured on holiday in Italy last year with his wife Lynn, a safety manager. She has supported him during his appeal to the decision . They added that he was suspended for three semesters and must go through sensitivity counselling if he wishes to reapply next winter. 'The university has essentially issued a straightjacket to every writing student to protect the delicate sensibilities of faculty and staff' Greg Lukianoff, FIRE advocate . His wife Lynn has supported him during his appeal to the decision and his lawyers say he has been treated like a ‘student with a mental disability’. Ms Mitzelfeld told university officials that she would leave if they did not ban Mr Corlett from campus, reported the Huffington Post. She also claimed she was concerned he might be carrying a gun in her classrooms after he allegedly wrote about his support for carrying concealed weapons in previous work. This can be seen in a detailed letter he wrote to the Oakland Post student paper in January 2010, showing a strong understanding of the subject. Likeness: He compared one teacher in another entry to Ginger Grant, a character played by actress Tina Louise in 1960s TV comedy series Gilligan's Island . Compared: Hot for Teacher by Van Halen, pictured, was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band, which became famous for its bizarre video . ‘This is a wild overreaction to a student's creative writing,’ FIRE President Greg Lukianoff, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said. 'The real issue is the First Amendment. It's about academic freedom and about due process' Joseph Corlett . ‘The university has essentially issued a straightjacket to every writing student to protect the delicate sensibilities of faculty and staff.’ Oakland University Writing Center director Sherry Wynn Perdue told the Huffington Post that Mr Corlett had ‘victimised’ Ms Mitzelfeld. Hot for Teacher by Van Halen was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band's album 1984, which courted controversy with its bizarre video.

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 19:03 EST, 17 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:03 EST, 17 March 2013 . Revenue chiefs have been criticised by MPs after their 'disgraceful' tax helpline left millions out of pocket. Taxpayers had to fork out £136 million last year on premium-priced phone lines waiting to speak to HM Revenue & Customs. A quarter of their 79 million calls went unanswered. Now the Commons Public Accounts Committee has warned the situation could get even worse, thanks to plans to shut hundreds of tax inquiry centres. Premium-priced: Taxpayers forked out £136 million on phone lines waiting to speak to HMRC last year . HMRC has promised improvements . but MPs condemned its 'woefully inadequate and unambitious' new target to . answer 80 per cent of calls within five minutes. The committee said there was a 'real risk' of things actually getting worse with new tax and benefit systems - such . as Iain Duncan Smith's Universal Credit welfare system - likely to add . to the volume of calls while staff numbers were being cut. HMRC opened a consultation yesterday on . closing all 281 of its face-to-face tax inquiry centres in favour of a . targeted 'mobile' system in homes, businesses or community locations. 'Real risk': MP Margaret Hodge believes closing all 281 HMRC face-to-face inquiry centres will add more pressure on its phone lines . It claims the move will save . customers almost £12million a year in lost time and travel costs and . slash running costs by more than £13million a year. But MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons committee, believes the move would 'undoubtedly put more pressure on phone lines'. 'HMRC considers that it will be able to . improve service standards by reducing avoidable contact with customers . and using its staff more flexibly,' she said. 'It may need to put in additional resources, though, to avoid the kind of plummeting performance we have seen in the past. 'Just how the department is going to . improve standards of customer service, given the prospect of its having . fewer staff and receiving a higher volume of calls, is open to question. 'HMRC plans to cut the number of . customer-facing staff by a third by 2015. At the same time, the stresses . associated with introducing the Real Time Information System, Universal . Credit and changes to child benefit are likely to drive up the number . of phone calls to the department.' Mrs Hodge said it was 'disgraceful' that . taxpayers who had no choice about dealing with HMRC were subjected to . unacceptable levels of service when they phoned or wrote. And she criticised the department's . 'abysmal record' in not answering 20million calls in 2011/12 and only . responding to 66 per cent of letters within 15 days. 'We are pleased to see signs that . HMRC is changing its attitude,' she said. 'Officials are beginning to . realise that good customer service lies at the heart of any strategy to . maximise revenues while cutting costs. Cost cutting: HMRC said closing its centres will save customers £12m a year in lost time and travel costs . 'However, HMRC's new target of answering 80 per cent of calls within five minutes is woefully inadequate and unambitious.' The new target would still leave 16 million people waiting more than five minutes, the committee's report pointed out. 'If there are significant increases . in customer contact, HMRC may need to put in additional resources to . avoid its performance plummeting, as it has in the past, let alone . improving as it should,' it concluded. HMRC's problems have happened despite spending £900million on customer service. Defence: HMRC said it has been answering more than 90 per cent of calls to its contact centres . The Commons public accounts committee welcomed planned improvements, including a call-back system and a move away from expensive 0845 numbers. A spokesman for the HMRC said: 'This report criticises a previous poor standard of service from which HMRC has already recovered. 'In the past three months, HMRC has been answering more than 90 per cent of calls to our contact centres and during the current year we have replied to 84.5 per cent of the 16 million pieces of post we have received within 15 working days. 'To make it cheaper for customers to call us, we already transferred our Tax Credits phone lines from 0845 to 0345 numbers, and will begin to move our remaining lines to 03 numbers from April.'

Almost 70,000 blue badges and 100,000 bus passes have been confiscated as part of a huge drive to detect fraud by cross-checking official records. The travel scams form part of more than £1billion found to have been lost to fraud by the Audit Commission’s National Fraud Initiative (NFI). Since it was launched in 1996, the NFI has also detected 15,000 cases of pension overpayments worth £450million, over £250million of housing benefit overpayments as well as incorrectly awarded single person council tax discounts amounting to £160million. Confiscations: The National Fraud Initiative has found far too many motorists have been claiming disabled badges for parking . The initiative compares data held by 1,300 public sector and 77 private sector organisations such as councils, the police, government departments and hospitals. It aims to identify potentially fraudulent claims, errors and overpayments. Where inconsistencies are found between two or more sets of data - for example, when data matching shows a person listed as dead also being in receipt of a pension - the relevant body will investigate and, if appropriate, stop pension payments. So far, 68,736 blue badges and 97,361 concessionary travel passes have been cancelled as a result of investigations carried out by local authorities after the NFI raised concerns. Around half of those motorists or travellers were caught during 2010/11, the most recent ‘matching’ period for which statistics are available. During that time, 32,633 ‘disabled’ motorists and 52,635 bus travellers had their passes withdrawn. They included a woman from Bromley, south London, who was convicted of fraud after she was found to have been using the blue badge belonging to her deceased mother. The woman was fined £181. Abuse: So far 68,736 blue badges have been cancelled after local investigations . In 2008, a review of data relating to concessionary travel passes found that a husband had claimed travel tokens on behalf of his wife for at least the previous seven years - even though the wife had died in 1991. Portsmouth City Council recovered the remaining travel tokens and the value of the previous years’ tokens. While most of the frauds relate to pensions, council tax and housing benefit, the most recent two-yearly round of cross-referencing also uncovered 164 people with no legal right to work in the UK. The employees - working for organisations such as the NHS, local authorities and housing associations and either failed asylum seekers, working without a visa or on an expired visa - were subsequently dismissed or asked to resign. They were uncovered after the NFI matched data from the Border Agency against data on housing benefit claims, payroll records and housing tenancy. Crackdown: 97,361 concessionary travel passes have been cancelled . Jeremy Newman, Chairman of the Audit Commission, said: ‘The NFI is a powerful weapon in the fight to protect taxpayers’ money from fraud. ‘I applaud the commitment of the scheme’s participants. ‘The vigilance of organisations from local councils to central government departments, supplying essential data and investigating potential frauds flagged up by the initiative, has paid off to the tune of £1 billion. ‘We are working hard to ensure this valuable legacy of the Audit Commission continues to benefit the public.’ The Audit Commission said that the £1billion total fraud detection figure includes ‘estimated outcomes’ where it is possible to ‘assume that fraud, overpayments and error would have continued undetected without NFI data matching’, as well as the total value of frauds already detected.","68,736 blue badges and 97,361 travel passes have been cancelled .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:20 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:22 EST, 19 March 2013 . A last blast of winter blew through the Northeast on Tuesday, with snow and sleet delaying the start of school in some areas and making the morning commute an icy, slippery mess a day before spring starts. The winter storm that started overnight Monday and early Tuesday might even continue into Tuesday night for northern areas. Snow is expected to cover newly bare patches of ground and force people to gas up their snow blowers again on the last day of winter. Scroll down for video . The snow that hit New York on Monday night came just hours before the formal start of spring, as much of the North East faced an unexpected storm . Cold: New York's storm started as snow and eventually turned into rain, creating slushy streets and dangerous road conditions for the Tuesday morning commute . What hit: The coastal regions of New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts were hit by less snow than their inland counterparts . Not quite: This person clearly agrees that layers and not bold spring prints are needed in Boston today . The nasty weather led some schools in upstate New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut to close, adding a few more snow days to school calendars. At Ashburnham True Value Hardware, in north-central Massachusetts, employee Andrew Stanley said he hadn't noticed extra sales of shovels and salt, though the National Weather Service forecast 7 to 19 inches of a mix of snow and sleet. He did hear a little grumbling, though. Winter wind storm: A tractor trailer hangs off a bridge in Tupelo, Mississippi after high winds caused a crash on Monday . Overturned: Fire fighters examine the crash- where the driver was left unharmed- and try to assess how to proceed . Safety required: A SUV went into a ditch and rolled in Rockefeller Township, Pennsylvania because of the snow . 'Everybody's about sick of winter,' he said Monday. But some were welcoming the forecast, as the coming storm looked to extend the ski season. Just a year ago this week, local temperatures hit the 80s, prompting skiers in Maine to strip down to shorts and bikini tops and forcing an end to the season at many mountains. When will it end: Towns like Benscreek, Pennsylvania (pictured) were not hit as badly as Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts . Widespread: Winter Storm Ukku is causing trouble across much of the Northern U.S. on Tuesday . Greyed out Gotham: The fog that came from the wintery mix caused bad visibility at the tip of Manhattan, meaning that the full height of the Freedom Tower was not clear to spectators . At Sugarbush Resort in Vermont, communications manager Patrick Brown said more snow now could make spring the best time of year for many. 'Skiers like both of those things: great sunny warm days and lots of snow,' Brown said. The forecasts called for as much as 20 inches of snow in parts of northern New England, with lesser amounts mixed with sleet further south. Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, could each get 4-8 inches, and Hartford, Connecticut, 4-8 inches of snow and sleet. Portland, Maine, could get at least a foot of snow. Montpelier, Vermont, was expecting at least 10 to 18 inches, and Concord, New Hampshire, 7 to 13 inches. Scary: In the South, the weather threats came in the form of severe wind and lightning, as seen in the sky above in Montgomery, Alabama . Looming: Storms traversed across Lawrence County, Alabama on Monday . Destruction: The McCullar family inspect the damage to their RV in Clay, Alabama on Monday . Those totals could go much higher if the storm continues into Tuesday night. The likelihood of school cancellations Tuesday led Massachusetts officials to postpone the English composition section of its standardized state test until next Monday, to keep all schools on the same test date. Boston, which kept schools open for the most recent storm, cancelled classes for Tuesday. After a storm earlier this month dumped over a foot of snow in some areas and caused coastal flooding in Massachusetts, some New Englanders weren't looking forward to more winter weather. Hail: National Weather Service meteorologist Anna Weber said there were reports of hail the size of softballs in some areas around Jackson . Dangerous: The size of the hail in Mississippi posed as a threat for drivers . In downtown Concord, New Hampshire, Jennifer Hutchins said: 'I hate it ... I guess I like to watch it fall, but I don't like when it sticks around.' 'I'm tired of it,' said Paula Lochhead. 'But we live in New Hampshire, what are you gonna do?' The South bore the brunt of the storm on Monday, though theirs came in the form of golf ball-sized hail throughout parts of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. In Alabama, thunderstorms caused severe rain and wind, damaging several homes.

Trent Mays, 17, (left), stands and apologizes to the victim and her family after he and co-defendant Ma'Lik Richmond, 16, were found delinquent on rape and other charges after their trial in juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio today . Her words are made more remarkable by the fact that her daughter does not share her feelings and cannot yet forgive Richmond and Mays, 17, for what they did to her. Speaking to MailOnline outside the Jefferson County Juvenile Court, the family’s solicitor, Bob Fitzsimmons, said: ‘It’s a very religious, spiritual family. They are praying for those two young men also.’ The family’s priest, Father Larry Dorsch, had been in court throughout the grueling trial and described them as very active members of St Paul’s Roman Catholic Church in Weirton. But asked if the victim too had forgiven the boys who betrayed her trust, humiliated her and preyed on her when she was at her most vulnerable Mr Fitzsimmons said: ‘I think she was prepared to do that. She came here wanting to forgive them but she hasn’t made that decision yet.’ He continued: ‘This thing might have never happened had someone approached the family sooner. ‘They are a very religious family. They would have accepted an apology at the time.’ The victim was not in court to hear the verdict delivered.

Family members console each other as Judge Thomas Lipps (not shown) delivers the verdicts in the trial of Ma'lik Richmond, 16 and Trent Mays, 17, in juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio, March 17, 2013 . Crime: Mays and Richmond were today found guilty of digitally penetrating a 16-year-old West Virginia girl at a party last August . According to Mr Fitzsimmons: ‘It is a sad day. Why should she be part of that sadness?’ It has, he explained, been hard enough for her to endure the days of testimony and of waiting for the moment she had long dreaded – taking the stand. That anxiety and nervousness was only worsened by the fact that her testimony was twice delayed in a trial with days at time running to a marathon 13-and-a-half hours. Mr Fitzsimmons said: ‘There has been a lot of hand holding and hugs and a lot of anxiousness and nerves.’ And though she may not have forgiven the boys who have put her through so much she has, he said, shown remarkable compassion for them. Judge Thomas Lipps talks from the bench to the families of Trent Mays and Ma'Lik Richmond after he pronounced them delinquent on rape and other charges after their trial in juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio . Apologies: Trent Mays, 17, left, stands and apologizes to the victim and her family after he and co-defendant Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found delinquent on rape and other charges . He said: ‘This was very difficult for her to go through. You saw her break down. ‘She’s always felt bad for the boys. She’s pretty strong but she’s a 16 year old girl who didn’t want to get anybody into trouble. ‘These boys accused themselves. She actually liked one of them. She had a crush on him.’ Now it is highly likely that a civil case will be brought against the defendants and though Mr Fitzsimmons would not be drawn on the timing of any such action he has confirmed that he is representing the family in the matter, adding: ‘Remorse did come late in my opinion.’ And in emotional scenes today both defendants Trent Mays, 17, and Ma’lik Richmond, 16, wept uncontrollably as Judge Thomas Lipps handed down his verdict, describing their actions as ‘profane and ugly.’ As Mays and Richmond were comforted by their attorneys and their families sobbed, prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter pressed for a stern sentencing reminding the judge: ‘They showed absolutely no regard for what happened to the victim. Verdict: Two protestors hug outside the Jefferson County Justice Center after hearing the verdict in the trial . ‘In the case of Mays once the information got out, there was a very conscious decision to turn it on her. ‘The lack of remorse was appalling’ Today, as both Steubenville High School students faced the reality of the consequences of what happened that August night last year, their remorse appeared overwhelming. Both have been sentence to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with the maximum stay of until they are 21. Mays faced an additional charge of the use and dissemination of nude images of a minor. He received the same sentence for that to run consecutively. His minimum detention is two years. His actions were, according to Judge Lipps, ‘more egregious’ making it inappropriate that he should face the same sentence as Richmond. Richmond’s father, Nathaniel, who has been present in court every day made his way over to his son, fell to his knees and told him that he loved him. ‘My life is ruined,’ Richmond told attorney his Walter Madison, who was clearly shocked at the verdict. Mays father, Bryan, held his head in his hands as the defendant’s sister Rhiannan and mother wept. Both defendants took the opportunity to address the victim and her family – present for the verdict and visible to the defendants but out of view of the main court in a screened off section of seating. Mays was composed as he said: ‘I would like to apologize to [the victim] and her family, my family and the community. No pictures should have been sent let alone ever taken.’ But though Mays apologized quite specifically for taking pictures of the victim and sending them nowhere did he mention or offer an apology for the rape. In every communication with the victim following the night of 11 -12 August he repeatedly denied raping her. In fact in an incriminating detail it is an allegation he denies before it is ever made. Again and again his texts show him turning the blame on the victim, hectoring her, pressurizing her not to go to the police and telling her that the rape ‘didn’t happen.’ Small town: Both defendants played football for Steubenville High School's team Big Red . Standing in court, convicted of that crime and filled with apparent regret, the rape remained a crime for which he does not apologize. When it came to Richmond’s turn, he walked towards the victim and her family, across the courtroom, weeping; ‘I would like to apologize. I had no intention to put you guys through this. I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say. ‘I ruined her life.’ At this, he could no longer speak  because he was overcome with tears, and was walked back to this seat by Fred Abdalla Jr, Chief Probation Officer for Jefferson County Juvenile Court. Apologies followed from Bryan Mays, Greg Aggresta – Richmond’s guardian who, along with his wife Jennifer have been in court every day. The Aggresta’s have spoken openly about their support for Richmond and love for him ‘whatever happened.’ Today in court they appeared emotionally shattered. Richmond was not in their care when the events took place. On the map: The working class town of Steubenville, located in eastern Ohio, has a population of around 18,000 . Across days of often appalling testimony the court has heard texts, tweets and emails between the defendants and their friends. They have heard about pictures, been reminded of vile video rants and seen the reality of what these boys did and how they behaved, who they were, when nobody else was looking. The case has scandalized America and scarred the small town of Steubenville, Ohio. Mays and Richmond will begin their sentence today. They will be taken to an institute just northwest of Columbus, Ohio where they will be assessed and a decision made as to where they should spend their time in custody. ‘So much of what happens with their future depends upon their attitude and how they embrace their rehabilitation,’ said Judge Lipps. ‘There is plenty of room to demonstrate your good character. There is also plenty of room to make mistakes.’ We're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable.","Mother of rape victim told Ma'lik Richmond today in court that she forgives him for his crimes of Steubenville rape .

A call girl has scrapped plans to start up Shetland's first ever escort service on the islands due to a lack of business. A woman named only as Honey, a 46-year-old Brazilian, is believed to have started offering her services earlier this year in the main port in Lerwick. She wanted to start a full time business called Magnificent Shetland Escort and charged £180 an hour. But she only had two emails in six months. Vice: The harbour town of Lerwick in Shetland where Honey is believed to have been offering her services . She said: 'I don't know if I could pay my bills if I stayed. I have a lot of local clients. 'If they are married, they are worried about putting something in the back of their wives' minds.' According to Honey, Shetlanders would often travel to Aberdeen, where she is based, because they were worried members of the community might find out. One even travelled to Norway to see her. Last week she sought to reassure the community about the nature of her work telling The Shetland Times that she is 'a very professional lady'. She said: 'I just don't want people to think I'm a drug addict that's come to Shetland or that I'm selling someone else or trafficking girls.' Honey was visiting the isles around once every three weeks and would normally stay for a long weekend. Most of her clients were rich oil workers, often from Aberdeen, she said. The sex worker added that she knew of two local prostitutes on the islands but she was concerned others might arrive in the near future. Councillor Andrea Manson, 54, was shocked to discover the vice trade had reached Shetland and said such services was an exploitation of women. Prostitution is not against the law in .

An agriculture student has been sent to prison for killing a motorist after he lost control of his car because he was eating crisps. Teenager Adam Garthwaite was driving home from college on country roads when his van veered off course and crashed head-on into an oncoming car. The other driver, 38-year-old Paul Garcia, who lived with his wife and two young children in Launceston, Cornwall, died instantly in the crash. Garthwaite, 19, terrified motorists in the minutes before the smash in March last year as he tailgated other cars and overtook at speed while driving near the border between Devon and Cornwall. He later said he had no memory of how the crash happened, but police found a half-full bag of crisps in the car and suggested that he had not been paying attention to the road while he ate the snack. The student sobbed uncontrollably throughout the hearing at Exeter Crown Court, which was attended by the victim's family as well as his own relatives. Before the accident, he was a prize-winning young farmer who had won an award as Shepherd of the Year and already looked after his own flock. Garthwaite, of Frithelstock in Devon, admitted causing death by careless driving and dangerous driving. He was sentenced to 12 months in a young offenders institution and banned from driving for two years. Court: The 19-year-old agriculture student was handed his sentence at Exeter Crown Court . Judge Francis Gilbert told him: 'I accept you have been clearly affected by the consequences of this accident but I also have to consider the consequences for the deceased's widow and his two very young children, which are entirely predictable in the circumstances. 'This was a case of inattention. The positioning of your car on the wrong side of the road may not have been deliberate but it created a very obvious danger and had fatal consequences. 'You allowed your car to become a serious danger to others. I consider this case comes into a category of falling not far short of dangerous driving.' Andrew MacFarlane, prosecuting, said Garthwaite was driving back from the Duchy College at Callington on the A388 and had a friend in the car with him. The dangerous driving took place just before and inside St Giles-in-the-Heath, where he overtook two cars at such speed that one passenger called him a 'plonker' and a learner driver told her instructor that he would end up in hospital. Police experts were baffled as to the cause of the crash until they examined the inside of his car. Mr MacFarlane said: 'They found a quantity of crisps on the dashboard and the thought occurs that he may have been consuming them, although he denied that possibility.' Jason Taylor, defending, said Garthwaite is so racked by guilt that he is now a broken shell of a man, accepts he deserves to be punished and has written a letter of apology to Mr Garcia's widow. He said before the crash he ran his own farming business as well as studying at college and was a prominent Young Farmer, winning an award as Young Shepherd of the Year. Mr Taylor said: 'The evidence in this case points to inattention, whether because he was talking to his passenger or because of the bag of crisps.'

UPDATED: . 16:57 EST, 18 March 2013 . For many, just taking part in a single marathon is the achievement of a lifetime, but Julie Weiss, they've become something of a weekly routine. She has run 52 of them - one a week - for the past year in memory of her dad who passed away from pancreatic cancer. Yesterday, the 42-year-old California mother of two finally stopped as she crossed the finish line of the Los Angeles Marathon. Scroll down for video . Marathon Goddess: Julie Weiss has run 52 marathons in 52 weeks raising money for pancreatic cancer awareness in memory of her father who died from the disease . Her aim was to raise awareness of the disease that killed her father just one month after he was diagnosed in November 2010. Doctors say the disease has less than a 5 percent survival rate. 'Pancreatic cancer is my only competition out there and I intend to beat it,' she told the Today Show. 'As I learned more about pancreatic cancer, I had to do something more to raise awareness and raise hope and raise money for this severely underfunded disease,' she said, 'so I decided to do something dramatic.' 1362 miles: Yesterday was Julie's final marathon having completed one race each week for an entire year. She has raised almost $180,000 . In the name of her father: Maurice Weiss died from pancreatic cancer. His daughter Julie was told he'd live another six months but he passed away after one. She thinks of him every step of the way . Challenge: Julie's modesty shines through. She says the real task isn't the 26.2 miles each weekend but traveling and returning back to California for work on the Monday morning! Julie began her incredible challenge with a marathon in Rome and then entered a race every weekend in some city across North America. As soon as she left work at 5pm on Friday she would be on a plane, ready to begin the next race, before heading home to California on the Sunday. Julie says the real challenge is to travel to a different city, state or country each weekend and be back in the office for Monday morning - all while raising two children. Charity: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and killed Julie's father Maurice just 35 days after he was diagnosed . Triumphant: Julie Weiss, 42, releases air balloons to commemorate with members of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, after completing her 52nd marathon in 52 weeks . Still going: Julie Weiss with her friend David Levine after completing yesterdays LA marathon. She says she will rest for a while but will complete another year of marathons by 2020 and raise $1 million . She has only been running for the past five years. Initially it was to lose some weight and get in better shape physically and mentally. What began as simply running around the block moved into running races before she finally progressed onto marathons. It made her father, Maurice, extremely proud, and after each race she would call her Dad to tell him how she had done. In that short amount of time she has earned the nickname 'Marathon Goddess' and become something of a folk hero in the running community. According to her nicknamed website MarathonGoddess.com the 1,362 miles she's covered has raised almost $180,000 for charity.' Running in memory: Weiss lost her dad to pancreatic cancer in 2010, just a few weeks before she qualified for the Boston Marathon. Through her website, marathongoddess.com, she's hoping to raise $1,000,000 by 2020 . Making each one count: Julie started running and her father thought it was fantastic. He supported her on her journey to qualify for the Boston Marathon. He passed away before the race but she says she felt his presence every step of the way . 'When people tell me I'm crazy or nuts, it means I'm on the right track and doing something good,' she says. Online she pledges the following: 'To honor my father, I will run 52 marathons in one year to show how strong the human spirit can be. When you do what you love, for those you love, that is where the miracles happen. Together we can make a difference, and pave the way to a happy, healthy, cancer free life.' Photo finish: Another marathon to cross off the list as Julie continues her task of 52 marathons in a year . Medallion woman: Julie Weiss holds down a full-time job and raised nearly $180,000 so far. She credits the memories of her dad and others who have suffered with pancreatic cancer fueling her 42-year-old legs . Nickname: She's known as the Marathon Goddess in running circles... for obvious reasons! Although she is spurred on by the memory of her father, on her Facebook page she dedicated each marathon to a cancer victim. Julie says she's hanging up her running boots for now but is hoping to run another set of 52 marathons in 52 weeks to reach her ultimate goal of $1 million for pancreatic cancer research and awareness.

"By . Associated Press Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:03 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:47 EST, 18 March 2013 . Prosecutors have opened the murder trial of a Philadelphia abortion provider by telling jurors he routinely forced women who came to him into labor and then killed their babies. Dr. Kermit Gosnell faces the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of seven infants allegedly born alive at his clinic. Authorities say he would sever their spines with scissors. A pregnant refugee, Karnamaya Mongar, also died after being given too much anesthesia and pain . medication during a 2009 abortion at his West Philadelphia clinic. Assistant District Attorney Joanne . Pescatore said that evidence would show that . Gosnell, 72, was a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' who 'used and abused . desperate women'. Charged: Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor, is accused of killing seven babies that were born alive. The opening statements in his trial began on Monday . She said he preyed on vulnerable women who were often seeking abortions later than the 24th week, after which abortions are illegal in Pennsylvania. 'The standard practice here was to slay babies,' Pescatore said. 'This is not a case about abortion... This is a case about murder.' Pescatore says the unlicensed, untrained employees who helped carry out the gruesome procedures were equally desperate because they needed work. She says investigators found $250,000 in cash at Gosnell's home in 2010, proof of the money he made from the abortion and pain clinic. But in his own statements, Gosnell's lawyer, Jack McMahon, accused officials of 'an elitist, racist prosecution' against his black client. Death: Karnamaya Mongar, pictured with her husband, died at Dr Gosnell's clinic in 2009 . 'This is a targeted, elitist and . racist prosecution of a doctor who’s done nothing but give (back) to the . poor and the people of West Philadelphia,' McMahon said. 'It’s a . prosecutorial lynching of Dr. Kermit Gosnell.' Gosnell has pleaded not guilty. Eight clinic workers charged with him . have pleaded guilty, including his wife, a beautician accused of . helping him perform stealth third-term abortions on Sundays. Gosnell set out to offer women safe, . legal abortions in the 1970s, but that's far from what drug . investigators say they found inside his West Philadelphia clinic in . 2010. By then, Gosnell had gone years . without health department inspections, perhaps because state officials . preferred a hands-off approach to a political misstep in the abortion . quagmire. Victims: Gosnell is accused of killing Marie Smith, the daughter of Johnnie Mae Smith (pictured), after a botched abortion . The result, according to a grand jury report, is that Gosnell's patients received the equivalent of the back-alley abortions that advocates of legalized abortion had hoped to eradicate. The devastating 2011 grand jury report describes nearly unfathomable conditions: fetal body parts stored in glass jars and staff refrigerators; filthy, blood-stained operating areas; women and teens maimed after Gosnell perforated a uterus or colon. 'Anybody walking into that clinic . should have known immediately that it should have been shut down,' said . Bernard Smalley, a lawyer for the family of Karnamaya Mongar. Philadelphia prosecutors accuse state . and local authorities of turning a blind eye to laws requiring regular . inspections. And they say the occasional complaints that trickled in, . one after an earlier patient death, went nowhere. House of horrors: A grand jury image shows what police claim are bags of body parts at the practice . The case drew national attention and prompted state lawmakers to tighten clinic regulations. Pennsylvania abortion clinics now have to meet the same standards of care required by ambulatory surgical facilities, and other states are also adopting that rule. Planned Parenthood and other providers complain that the cost of updating facilities to meet ambulatory clinic rules can be prohibitive and further restricts women's access to abortions. Pennsylvania already required parental or judicial consent for minors, a 24-hour waiting period and a ban on abortions after 24 weeks gestation. Mongar had fled Bhutan and spent 19 . years in refugee camps, some in Nepal, before arriving in the U.S. in . 2008 with her husband and three children. 'Filthy': Investigators say Gosnell's clinic, the Women's Medical Society, catered to minorities, immigrants and poor women. It was also allegedly the site of unimaginable filth . Scene: A police car is seen outside the the Women's Medical Society in 2011 following Gosnell's arrest . When she discovered she was pregnant, she went to a clinic in Virginia, where she lived, but was referred to Gosnell because she was in her second trimester. She was 19 weeks pregnant when her adult daughter brought her to Gosnell's Women's Medical Center. The thin, 4-foot-11 Mongar, who spoke no English, was allegedly given a lethal dose of Demerol and other drugs before Gosnell, the only licensed doctor on staff, ever arrived. Gosnell earned kudos by returning to the area after medical school, when he could have set up shop in the suburbs. He worked out of a storefront he bought in the run-down Mantua section. But Gosnell came to operate under the radar, relying on unlicensed medical school graduates, untrained clerical staff and even a teen working after school to administer anesthesia and help perform abortions, usually on poor and immigrant women paying a few hundred dollars in cash.

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 12:08 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:35 EST, 18 March 2013 . Evelyn Agbeko says she was 'confused' when she wrote her notes . A nurse at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital claimed an elderly patient was asleep when the woman was dead, a hearing was told today. Evelyn Agbeko, with colleague Theresia Van Der Knaap, allegedly failed to provide 'basic life support' when they discovered the 81-year-old unresponsive. As the pensioner's life drained away they did not even start chest compressions or summon the hospital's resuscitation team, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Agbeko later claimed in her notes that the woman was asleep between 4am and 6am, when she had passed away at about 3am. The woman, referred to as Patient A, was on dialysis and had been admitted to A&E at the hospital at 9.25am on April 15, 2010, suffering from shortness of breath. But when her condition did not improve she was admitted to Ward 11 where Agbeko was the nurse in charge. At 2.30am on April 16, registrar Dr Helen Steed began considering whether or not to impose a 'Do Not Attempt Resuscitation' order, in light of the patient's chances of survival if she arrested. Dr Steed decided she wanted to see the woman first, but before she could review Patient A, Susan Voss, acting hospital site manager, received a call stating she had died. 'Ms Voss received a telephone call from Ward 11 at approximately 4am and she believes that this telephone call came from Ms Agbeko. 'She was informed in this call that Patient A had passed away. She asked if the patient was expected to die, and she was informed that the patient was for resuscitation,' said Hannah Stephenson, for the NMC. 'Ms Voss will state that she informed that nurse that she should not have called Ms Voss, but she should have called the resuscitation team to tend to the patient. 'Ms Voss will state that the nurse then . argued the point with her and stated that the patient has been dead for . approximately five minutes,' she added. The nurses deny making inadequate medical notes and failing to provide basic life support for the Stafford Hospital patient . Ms Stephenson told the panel that the expected procedure would have been for Agbeko to press the emergency alarm and commence chest compressions until the resuscitation team arrived. Samantha Adams, a nurse who was working that night, allegedly went for a break at 3am and around 15 minutes later Van Der Knaap went to her and told her that Patient A had died, the hearing was told. 'She commented to Ms Van Der Knaap that the patient was for twos, which meant that the patient was for resuscitation,' said Ms Stephenson. She added that this was a reference to extension '222', which was the number for the resuscitation team. Ms Stephenson said: 'Ms Van Der Knaap repeated that the patient had already died. 'Ms Adams will state that she was shocked by this and informed the nurses that the call should have been put out if there was no Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order in place.' Agbeko, who knew Patient A had already died, subsequently made two entries in woman's medical notes stating she was asleep at 4am and 6am. The nurse admits this, claiming that she was simply confused at the time of making the entries. She and Van Der Knaap deny all other allegations against them including making inadequate medical notes and failing to provide basic life support when they found the pensioner unresponsive. Stafford Hospital was the subject of a two-year public inquiry, which concluded last month, into its appalling standards of care. Official documents suggest up to 1,200 more patients than expected died at the Weston Road site between 2005 and 2008. Sir Robert Francis QC, who chaired the inquiry, has said the true figure may never be known. The central London hearing, which Agbeko is attending, but Van Der Knaap is not, continues.

But the mother-of-two has completely turned her life around and is backing a new initiative to help stop forced marriage in Scotland. Sameem has now completely turned her life around and is backing a new initiative to help stop forced marriage in Scotland . She said: ‘I was raised in a children's home until I was seven and it was a fabulous place. But then I was suddenly taken home. ‘I was used as a domestic slave and beaten if I didn't do what I was told. ‘The children's home had raised me to be an individual and think for myself but that part of my personality was soon beaten out of me.’ Sameem, whose family lived in Birmingham, told her school what was happening and a social worker was sent to her home. At the age of just 13 Sameem Ali was taken from Glasgow to Pakistan and made to marry a man more than twice her age . But a family member, who beat her nearly unconscious for alerting the authorities, brought the family to Glasgow in a bid to escape suspicion. Sameem's family settled in Pollokshields and, although her brothers went to school, she was kept at home and forced to cook and clean. When she was 13 Sameem was told she and a family member were going on holiday to Pakistan. The 44-year-old said: ‘I was told I was going on holiday and I was really excited, at the children's home we used to go the beach and it was great fun, so I assumed the holiday would be like that. ‘But when we got to Pakistan I was introduced to two guys and told, “Of these two guys, which one do you like best?” ‘One was chosen - he was much older than me, in his late 20s - and I was married to him in a very quick ceremony.’ Sameem said she had no idea what was happening and she was told she would be allowed to return to Scotland only if she was pregnant. She said: ‘I didn't know how to get pregnant so I prayed to God that I would. I was told me to let my husband do whatever he wanted to me. ‘Eventually I became pregnant and, at two months gone, we came back to Glasgow.’ Sameem's new husband wanted to move to the UK and it was thought having a British-born child would help his visa application. Back in Glasgow the teenager attended GP visits and saw a midwife throughout her pregnancy, but medical staff had no suspicions that anything was wrong. She said: ‘I made all my GP visits, I saw a midwife. If one person had asked me if I was okay then I would have told everything, but my family constantly told me to be quiet and I was slapped if I spoke up so there was no way I could tell anyone without being asked first.’ Sameem with one of the councilors Soryia Siddique who will support victims of forced marriage in Scotland . Completely alone, she felt there was nowhere to turn and no way to escape. But her life changed when a family friend from Pakistan visited. She said: ‘The friend was interested in women's rights and he could see how badly I was being treated. ‘One day I was taken to a solicitor to sign papers to have my husband in Pakistan come to Scotland. ‘I was terrified. I didn't want to see him again and I didn't want him to come here. ‘It was a tipping point and the family friend said he was leaving - and would I come with him? ‘So we left and I moved into a homeless hostel in Manchester.’ Her brother was furious that she had, in his eyes, disgraced the family, and hired four hit men to find her. He paid them £50 each to carry out the job. Councillor Soryia Siddique and Sameem Ali hope that hearing Sameem's story will help others in similar situations come forward . Sameem said: ‘That's what my life was worth. £50. I was terrified because I knew what my brother was capable of. ‘I had disgraced the family honour and it is the culture that honour must be restored by the head of the family.’ The first Sameem knew of the attempt on her life was when police arrived at her house. Officers had been tipped off and arrested the men, who were found to have baseball bats and nunchucks in the boot of their car. They, and her brother, were imprisoned. The family friend who rescued Sameem is now her husband.

She said: ‘We both worked in the same factory - we had taken any jobs we could get as we didn't want to go on benefits. ‘We married and returned to work afterwards. And now we've been together for 26 years.’ Sameem has nothing to do with her family in Glasgow.

But it took her a long time before she could talk about her story - and it was her son who prompted the turn around. She said: ‘My son came home from college one day and said, “Are you ashamed of me?” ‘I asked him what he meant and he said he worried I was ashamed of him because I had never spoken about what happened to me. ‘He said I should speak up to help other young women and so that's what I decided to do.’ Sameem works in Manchester to highlight forced marriage and she is now supporting a new learning resource developed by Glasgow Life that will be rolled out to teachers, youth workers and charity staff. It aims to help professionals spot the signs of forced marriage in young people. The pack is backed by the Scottish Government and forms part of a country-wide campaign to help those at risk of forced marriage.

A suspect has been arrested in connection with the execution of American journalist Daniel Pearl in Pakistan 11 years ago. Qari Abdul Hayee, also known as Asadullah, was taken into custody following a swoop by Pakistani paramilitary forces in Karachi on Sunday. Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and later beheaded by terrorists while working on an investigation in Pakistan four months after 9/11. A grisly video of his death was later posted online. New leads: A suspect was arrested on Sunday in relation to the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl who was abducted and beheaded in Pakistan 11 years ago . Abduction: The kidnap and subsequent murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl by terrorists in 2002 sent shock waves through the international community who had vehemently campaigned for his release . Hayee is under interrogation and then will be handed over to Pakistani police, authorities told ABC. Officials told the network that they do not believe the suspect carried out the murder but was 'privy' to information. Hayee, a former leader of the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi militant group in the southern Sindh province, was involved in other attacks in Karachi, according to authorities. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is a radical Sunni Muslim militant group that has carried out many attacks in Pakistan, especially against minority Shi'ite Muslims. 9/11 terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed reportedly confessed to murdering Daniel Pearl in 2007 but proof of his involvement is unconfirmed and he has never been charged for the crime. Mohammed is currently being held at Guantanamo Bay where he in on trial with four accomplices for their roles in the September 11 attacks on the Twin Towers which killed close to 2,800 people. Daniel Pearl was working as South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal when he disappeared on January 23, 2002. He had been investigating the story of British 'shoe bomber' Richard Reid who had allegedly tried to detonate explosives on a flight from Paris to Miami a month earlier. Days before he was abducted, Pearl had learned that his wife Mariane was expecting a baby boy. Telling his story: Mariane Pearl (second left with her son Adam) wrote a memoir about her late husband which was made into a film starring Angelina Jolie and Dan Futterman (right) Mariane remained in Pakistan and campaigned for her husband's release throughout his capture. Daniel Pearl's death was confirmed on February 21, 2002. There were outpourings of grief from political and religious leaders, along with ordinary people around the world, who had campaigned for his release. Three months later, Mariane gave birth to the couple's son Adam. Four kidnappers were convicted of Pearl's murder on July 15, 2002 but authorities have always believed that others were involved in the journalist's death. Marianne Pearl wrote a memoir entitled A Mighty Heart about her late husband's life which was adapted into a film starring Angelina Jolie as Mariane Pearl and Dan Futterman as the journalist.","Qari Abdul Hayee captured in Karachi, Pakistan on Sunday ."

Double tragedy: Judge Peter Fenn, 56, lost his battle to cancer just a few hours after his wife Maxine was found dead at their home in Ipswich . The devoted wife of a judge has died in a suspected suicide hours before he lost his battle with cancer. The body of Maxine Fenn, 46, was found at the couple’s home as her husband, Peter Fenn, 56, lay in a hospice bed. She was said to be ‘mentally and physically exhausted’ after caring for Mr Fenn throughout his three-year cancer ordeal. Friends described the deaths as ‘an almost Shakespearean tragedy’ and said the judge passed away in the hospice without knowing that his wife had died before him. Mr Fenn, who had been a judge at Ipswich Crown Court, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010 but carried on hearing cases until he fell ill during a trial last November. Friends contacted police last Thursday evening after Mrs Fenn, a keen horsewoman, failed to respond to text messages and phone calls. Officers broke down the front door of the couple’s house in Ipswich and found her dead inside with her two collie dogs alive and well beside her. It is believed that she had taken an overdose of pills. Mr Fenn, who was being cared for at St Elizabeth’s Hospice in Ipswich, died the next day. Yesterday friends said Mrs Fenn had cared tirelessly for her husband. Carol Hipkin, chairman of the Colne Valley Riding Club in Essex, where Mrs Fenn organised cross-country events, said: ‘They were a very close couple and she worked extremely hard looking after him and supporting him when he was ill. ‘She was a tower of strength to her husband. It was awful for her and towards the end she was mentally and physically exhausted. Talented: Maxine Fenn, 46, who was a talented and passionate horse-rider, was found dead at her home on Thursday night. Police are not treating her death as suspicious . ‘It was an ordeal for both of them. I like to think her spirit left her body and was at her husband’s bedside when he died.’ Mrs Hipkin said her friend had never talked about suicide, but added: ‘A couple of weeks ago, she did talk about what she wanted to happen if something happened to her. She was talking about who would look after her horses and how the dogs would possibly go back to the breeder.’ Cases at Ipswich Crown Court were halted on Monday while barristers, judges and court staff gathered to hear resident judge David Goodin pay tribute to Mr Fenn, who was an accomplished musician and director of music at his church in Stowmarket. Judge Goodin described him as ‘intelligent, dedicated, straightforward and respected’ and praised him for his ‘patience, fairness and authority without pomp and arrogance’. Discovery: Mrs Fenn was found dead at the couple's home, pictured, in Ipswich, Suffolk, around 8.40pm on Thursday night . Former colleagues of Mr Fenn paid tribute to the talented judge during a hearing at Ipswich Crown Court . He added: ‘In Maxine he had a wife who supported him through his judicial career and latterly through the gruelling illness he bore so bravely and for so long. 'As a couple they were dedicated to each other and shared a love of horses, dogs and travel.’ Barrister Martyn Levett, who was a close friend of Mr Fenn, added: ‘In his final days I asked if there was anything he would like to change or whether there was ever a time he felt like giving up. “Never”, he said, “I have done more than most. I have loved and been loved. I have good friends and my only wish is that I could spend more time with those who I will leave behind”. ‘By a cruel irony, almost Shakespearean in its tragedy, Maxine, ten years younger, predeceased him by no more than 24 hours in an untimely death herself.’ The couple, who married in 2000, had no children. An inquest into Mrs Fenn’s death will be opened next week.","Judge Peter Fenn, 56, died at St Elizabeth Hospice in Ipswich on Friday .

A schoolgirl has been dubbed a 'human rag doll' because she suffers from a debilitating condition that sees her joints dislocate up to ten times a day. Kitty Richardson, 12, has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the collagen proteins – building blocks that support tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, bones and blood vessels - in her body meaning that her bones and joints are weak. The budding musician started breaking bones when she was six-years-old, and by October 2011 her knees were giving way on a daily basis causing her to keep collapsing and falling over. Scroll down for video . Kitty is a descendant of the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, and has always dreamt of performing on stage . The budding musician started breaking bones when she was six-years-old . In October 2012 she was finally diagnosed with EDS, which only affects one in 15,000 people. Talking about the condition, her mother Abigail Richardson, 42, said: ‘We were in casualty nearly every week. ‘It was a family joke – “there's Kitty's school photo with her in a cast”. ‘But in October 2011 her knees started giving out on a daily basis and she was collapsing and falling over at school all the time and the way her legs go she just falls like a human rag doll. ‘She tried to make light of the falls and the pain because we had spent so much time in casualty and I was at the end of my tether with it.’ However, as time went on the condition has become so bad that Kitty struggles to walk without a stick. Kitty Richardson, 12, has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the collagen proteins in the body . ‘The other kids at school had to carry her around from class to class, and she would even crawl sometimes,’ Ms Richardson said. ‘She was so exhausted when she got home from school from just walking around and getting from class to class. ‘At one point she actually couldn't walk but that was only short-term, fortunately. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the connective tissues. Most types of the genetic condition affect the production of collagen, which gives tissue strength and allows it to stretch. Collagen is found in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, bone, blood vessels, the gut and the spine. It means joints are loose and unstable and prone to dislocating. Swelling, sprains and hyperextension are also common. Skin is soft and fragile and bruises easily. This leads to slow and poor wound healing. There is no known cure for EDS. Treatment may help to manage symptoms, such as surgery to repair muscle damage and medication for pain. Sufferers can wear joint braces, do . physical therapy to strengthen joints, avoid very physical activities . and wear sunscreen to reduce the risk of harm. ‘Kitty then got a walking stick just so that she could help support herself.’ However, the condition has not stopped the talented youngster from working towards her dream of becoming a professional piano player. Kitty, from Oakham, Rutland, is a descendant of the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, and has always dreamt of performing on stage. Ms Richardson, a magazine editor, said: ‘She has always been a keen musician and a natural talent. ‘She has always tinkered on the piano and when she was just five-years-old she wrote a short song on the piano about summer holidays. ‘But she decided to teach herself properly six months ago, and we got her signed up for lessons. ‘She downloads things like Mozart and just learns it all self-taught. ‘At seven she started violin lessons, and was very good, but she had to give that up when she was 11 because she was in so much pain. ‘It was a real shame, and no-one really believed Kitty that she was in that much pain and thought she was just giving up and being lazy.’ Kitty said: ‘I really didn't want to give up the violin, but I was in so much pain. ‘It was either give it up or suffer with the agony.’ Soon after being forced to give up the violin, she set her sights on learning the piano but has to contend with her knuckles frequently dislocating as she plays. Kitty said: ‘I love the piano more than the violin and it is frustrating that my EDS halts my progress, but in the times I can't actually play I am learning theory so that I keep learning.’ Kitty's mother, Abigail Richardson (pictured), says her daughter ended up in A&E almost once a week . Kitty, who lives with her mother, her father Peter, 46, and younger brother, Luc, seven, is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Edvard Greig, and plans to compose her own pieces. She said: ‘It's something I want to do because I can't perform properly all the time. ‘My EDS is a part of me, but it isn't the biggest part of me. This isn't what I thought everything would be like, but it means that I have to work that extra bit harder to get what I want in life.’","Kitty Richardson, 12, from Oakham, Rutland, has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome .

An antiques collector who sold a Chinese bowl may have lost out on £150,000 after forgetting he had another that would have made a lucrative pair. Tony Evans and his family were thrilled when his antique 'rice' bowl from the 18th century fetched a staggering £235,000 at auction. But it wasn't until after the sale that the family remembered a matching piece Mr Evans had given to son Simon 30 years ago. Tony Evans sold an antique rice bowl for £235,000 but had it been offered as a pair with another bowl he owned (pictured) experts believe the value would have increased by a third to nearer £650,000 . The second bowl is now set to command a . similar price when it sells as a single lot, making a total of nearly . £470,000 for the pair. But experts believe that had the items been offered together they could have fetched over £600,000. Mr . Evans, from Kent, had inherited the two Imperial porcelain bowls from . his father Fred who had brought them back from working in China in the . 1920s. The extremely rare . bowls are six inches in diameter, are decorated with pheasants and were . made for the Chinese Emperor Kangxi in the 1720s. Simon . Evans, a 55-year-old chartered surveyor, had no idea what his bowl was . when given it and has stored it in a box in the back of a cupboard for . three decades. Mr Evans, from East Anglia, said: ‘My jaw hit the floor when I found out my father's bowl sold for a six-figure sum. ‘A few days after the sale he suddenly announced that he thought there might have been a pair of them. ‘He had completely forgotten about giving it to me and I had also forgotten about receiving it. The second bowl is set to fetch a similar price when it sells as a single lot, making a total of nearly £470,000 . ‘It was my wife, Clare, who said 'oh . yes, we do have a Chinese bowl in a box' that prompted us to get it out . and low and behold there was the twin of the first bowl. ‘I had just put it in a cupboard for safekeeping and simply forgot about it. ‘I've decided to sell it not because I need the money but because I'm anxious about having something so valuable in the house. ‘It . is easy to wonder with the benefit of hindsight just how much a pair . would have been worth had we sold them together. A pair being sold . together must be extremely rare. ‘But it seems rather pointless to think like that now because it has been and gone.’ The . first pheasant bowl was sold last year by the Canterbury Auction . Galleries in Kent that had put a pre-sale estimate of £8,000 to £12,000 . on it. But because the . market for Oriental antiques is booming at the moment due to the . newly-rich Chinese buying back their heritage, bidding on it took off. It . eventually went to an anonymous Chinese buyer, who saw off 11 other . rival bidders to net it for £195,000. With the fees added on he would . have paid £235,000. Auctioneer Cliona Kilroy with the second Kangxi bowl which is due to be sold later next month . The same auction house is now selling the second bowl. Although the estimate is £150,000 there is no reason why it will not sell for a similar price. Tony Evans' father started collecting Oriental porcelain in 1925 during the time he worked for an Anglo/Chinese mining company in the port of Tientsin near Beijing. His son, now aged in his 80s, began his own collection in the 1960s and 1970s from top London dealers. Alastair Gibson, an expert of Chinese porcelain and consultant to the Canterbury Auction Galleries, said: ‘We obviously didn't know about the existence of the second bowl. ‘After the first sold for the significantly high price the vendor popped up and said he might have had a twin to that bowl. ‘Had we known it would have been nice to have the two bowls together in a single sale. Sadly, we didn't know.’ The auction for the second bowl takes place on April 16-17. A traditional chinese 'Phoenix' marriage bowl has sold for a whopping £260,000 at auction.

Britain could be hit by postal chaos ‘in the next few months’ after postmen yesterday voted to boycott up to half of all the letters posted every day. Around one in two letters delivered through your letterbox are currently handled by one of Royal Mail’s privately owned rivals. Royal Mail is only responsible for the ‘final mile’ of the delivery. Potential chaos: Unionised Royal Mail workers are angry about delivering post that has been handled for some of its journey by rival companies . But major companies such as BT, Thames Water, E.On, Sky, Barclays, Npower, O2 and Talk Talk currently use the postal giant’s rivals to handle all or some of their mail. Yesterday members of the militant Communication Workers’ Union voted unanimously to ‘boycott’ any mail which has been handled by its rivals, such as TNT Post and UK Mail. The CWU warned postmen will ‘refuse to handle third-party mail in the next few months’. A date will be announced at its annual conference in Bournemouth next month. It raises the threat of vast mountains of post piling up in Royal Mail’s delivery offices around Britain. Militant: Deputy general secretary of the CWU Dave Ward said 'competition is being allowed on the basis of low pay' Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the CWU, said: ‘Competition is being allowed on the basis of low pay and unreliable job security in private companies. ‘That will be a disaster for the sector, if it continues. We will take this action to protect jobs and services if the regulator doesn’t fulfil its duty.’ Since 2005, Royal Mail has rapidly lost its key business customers, according to data published recently by Ofcom. Just 5.2 per cent of all letters had been handled by a rival in 2005. Last year, it hit 44 per cent and Royal Mail says it is now close to 50 per cent. The CWU fears the haemorrhaging of business to its rivals will hit the universal service obligation, and could lead to the all-important service being diluted. This is the promise that Royal Mail will pick up and deliver letters six days a week for a uniform price anywhere in Britain from the Shetlands to St Austell. There is a significant pay gap between Royal Mail and its rivals, which concerns the CWU which warns of ‘a race to the bottom on the pay and conditions of postal workers.’ Last night, a Royal Mail spokesman said it is ‘fully committed’ to delivering its rivals’ mail, adding: ‘All of our customers’ mail is important to us and needs to be delivered.’ Yesterday an Ofcom spokesman said: ‘Ofcom has not made proposals to reduce the universal service requirement from six days a week, and nor do we have any legal powers to implement such a change. ‘To say we are consulting on such a proposal is simply untrue.’ Boycott looming: A date will be announced at the CWU annual conference in Bournemouth next month . A Department for Business spokesman said the Government is totally committed to the current universal service obligation, and said it could not be diluted without a vote in Parliament. TNT Post currently poses an even bigger threat to Royal Mail because it began a trial of its own postal service in west London last April in which it no longer uses Royal Mail postmen at all. Around 300,000 families and businesses in areas such as Ealing, Hammersmith and Victoria currently get some of their mail delivered by TNT’s 600 postmen dressed in a distinctive orange uniform. They have no obligation to meet strict targets set down by the regulator, such as the rule which says Royal Mail must aim to deliver 93 per cent of first-class mail the next day.","Union members voted to boycott any mail handled by Royal Mail's rivals .

Benjamin Pierce Bishop, 59, who worked in intelligence in Hawaii, appeared in court to face one count of communicating national defence information to a person not entitled to receive it and one count of unlawfully retaining national defence documents and plans. According to the complaint filed in Honolulu, Bishop met the woman at a conference on international military defence issues and passed her the information by email after beginning a romantic relationship with her. The complaint said the 27-year-old woman . 'may have been at the conference in order to target individuals such as . Bishop', who had top secret security clearance since 2002.

US Attorney Florence Nakakuni said Bishop had been charged with giving defence secrets to his Chinese lover . She allegedly began an intimate relationship with Bishop in June 2011, and the authorities say he passed on the information to her in an email in May, and also in a phone call in September, when he told the woman about the deployment of US strategic nuclear systems and about the ability of the US to detect other nations' low- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Bishop is accused of hiding the relationship from the government even though his position and security clearance requires him to report contact with foreign nationals. Authorities conducting a covert search of Bishop's home in the Honolulu suburb of Kapolei found 12 individual documents marked 'secret' although he was not authorised to keep classified papers at home, court documents said. The woman asked Bishop last month . what western countries knew about 'the operation of a particular naval . asset of People's Republic of China', the complaint said, though the . topic fell outside Bishop's regular work assignments.

US Magistrate Judge Richard Puglisi conditionally appointed Bishop an attorney after hearing arguments that his finances weren't sufficient to cover the costs of defending himself. Bishop's court-appointed attorney Birney Bervar, said Bishop was a lieutenant colonel in the US Army Reserve. He said: 'Colonel Bishop has served this country for 29 years.  He would never do anything to harm the United States.' Bishop's lawyer Birney Bervar said his client would never do anything to intentionally harm the United States . Bart DaSilva, a neighbour of Bishop's, said the man lived alone and was initially friendly when he moved in about three years ago. DaSilva said Bishop once brought over a woman and a girl he said were his wife and daughter from Thailand. But he said he never saw Bishop with other visitors, and noticed that Bishop increasingly began to keep to himself. The complaint filed against Bishop at the court in Honolulu does not refer to the Chinese woman by name, calling her instead 'Person1' 'I kind of felt: ""What did we do?""' DaSilva said. 'It was almost like he switched off.' No-one was available for comment at Bishop's brown, two-storey home in a hilly neighbourhood overlooking Pearl Harbor and downtown Honolulu. Bishop, who faces a maximum potential sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted, was scheduled to appear in court this Friday for a hearing on whether he will remain in detention during the case.

The teenage actor, who cannot be identified because of his age, is accused of forcing himself on the 14-year-old boy, a fellow pupil at a stage school, during a rehearsal at a theatre. He allegedly grabbed the boy, dragged him down the stairs to a fire escape and performed a sex act on him. Court hearing: A 17-year-old child soap star is on trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, for allegedly molesting a fellow student at a stage school in London over two months in 2010 . The next day the actor’s girlfriend blocked the doors in the same stairwell and watched as he raped the boy, a court heard. Just before the second alleged attack, . the actor told the boy that they ‘needed to show (his girlfriend)’ what . they had done. The actor’s girlfriend had also urged the boy to ‘do it . for me’, Blackfriars Crown Court in London heard. Giving evidence yesterday, the boy said: ‘I said we didn’t need to show her anything, I said I need to get out.’ Timothy Forster, prosecuting, asked: ‘Could you get out?’ The boy replied: ‘No, (the girlfriend) was sitting against the doors. She was saying “do it for me”.  I said I didn’t want to.’ The boy told the court he only stopped the attack by biting the actor and forcing his way past the girlfriend and fleeing. After the alleged attacks, the  boy said he felt shocked, scared  and embarrassed. Asked why he did not immediately tell . anyone about what had happened, he replied: ‘I was just scared and . worried what other people would think. I was more scared that I would . not know how to say it.’ The attacks are said to have taken place in July, 2010. The court was told that the actor had also approached the boy and sexually assaulted him in a toilet in September 2010. The prosecutor told the court that . further incidents took place on a weekly basis over a six-month period, . ‘none of which he wanted’. The boy collapsed while giving evidence behind a screen in court on Monday and so yesterday gave evidence via video. Jurors heard how the TV actor’s . girlfriend first approached the boy during a rehearsal and broached the . subject of the boy’s sexuality. The same day the actor told him he was ‘bi’ and asked him to ‘come downstairs’, but the boy refused, the court heard.

Tyler Rathjen was frantically driving to hospital last Sunday as Ashley Rathjen delivered their son beside him and Iowa City Police were flashing their lights behind their SUV. The man recalled to KCRG.com that he thought: 'I should stop but I’m not going to, I’m going to get to the hospital.' When he was made to pull over, Iowa City police officer Kevin Wolfe was immediately required to act as a maternity nurse. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Wolfe said that by the time he reached the passenger door of the couple's black SUV, the baby's head and arms were already out. 'We were all having a different experience,' the officer told KCRG. While the officer was preparing to stop a speeding driver, Tyler was ready to explain his actions to police.

Wolfe helped deliver the newborn after pulling an SUV over for speeding . Ashley remembered: 'I kept saying: there’s no break (in contractions) there’s no break. He was coming at that time.' Thankfully for Ashley, the delivery was definitely quick and, in the circumstances, relatively easy. The couple, both of Williamsburg, had made it to within two blocks of Mercy Iowa City hospital when their baby boy, Owen, appeared into the world for the first time.

The Prime Minister sent Oliver Letwin as the only Conservative representative at late-night talks on the new Press regulation deal – unaware that campaign group Hacked Off would also be present. Cabinet Office minister Mr Letwin agreed to go to Labour leader Ed Miliband’s offices in the House of Commons late on Sunday to rubber stamp a Royal Charter deal. What Downing Street did not know was that four senior officials from Hacked Off, the campaign group fronting demands for a Press law, were there too – including co-founder Brian Cathcart and former Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris. Four senior officials from Hacked Off, the campaign group fronting demands for a Press law, including former Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris (centre), were present when the Royal Charter deal was rubber stamped . Professor Brian Cathcart from the 'Hacked Off' campaign was also there. There was no one from the newspaper industry present . There was no one from the newspaper industry, which played no part in drawing up the Royal Charter and only saw it for the first time when it was published at 4.30pm yesterday. Labour politicians in attendance included Mr Miliband, deputy leader and media spokesman Harriet Harman, her special adviser Ayesha Hazarika, former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer and Labour chief whip Rosie Winterton. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was also present for most of the discussion. Fuelled by Kit Kats and delivery pizza, the talks lasted until 2.30am. Tory sources insisted Mr Letwin had discussed the Prime Minister’s ‘red lines’ with him beforehand and made only ‘tiny’ concessions. Downing Street dismissed the idea that Mr Cameron had been asleep, saying he had been in touch with the Cabinet Office minister ‘throughout the night’ and was last in contact at 3.20am. The Prime Minister then took part in a conference call with senior colleagues to discuss the deal shortly after 6am. The Prime Minister sent Oliver Letwin as the only Conservative representative at the late-night talks . However, aides admitted he had not been aware that Hacked Off would be present, a fact they described as ‘not ideal’. Mr Letwin told Number Ten that Hacked Off had not been in the room as the deal was finally struck, but Labour insisted it  had been. Some sources suggested the Cabinet Office minister may have spent some of his time in an ‘ante-room’, accounting for some of the confusion. Conor Burns, a Tory MP who has been a leading member of the campaign to protect press freedom, said Hacked Off’s presence at the negotiations suggested a ‘grubby’ deal. But Dr Harris said: ‘We think it is a very wise move by [Mr Cameron] to accept essentially the Royal Charter proposed by Labour, Liberal Democrats and members of his own Conservative party which we much preferred in the negotiations. ‘It delivered cross-party support and that means it is much harder for the press to make politics out of this by divide and rule. ‘It is true to say that in the negotiations last night concessions and gains were made by him in terms of scope and the timing of exemplary damages – those are the only significant changes that were made that they had requested.’ As well as Dr Harris, the other Hacked Off members at the talks were co-founder Professor Cathcart, who lectures in journalism at Kingston University and is former deputy editor of the Independent on Sunday; Martin Moore, who founded the group and its predecessor, the Media Standards Trust; and chairman Hugh Tomlinson, QC, a barrister specialising in media law who has represented phone hacking victims.","It included co-founder Brian Cathcart and former Lib Dem MP Evan Harris .

A Halloween rapist kidnapped an 11-year-old boy at knifepoint as he walked home after trick-or-treating with friends, a court heard yesterday. Simon Heritage, 38, of Coventry, West Midlands, was arrested within hours of the sex attack after giving the young victim his home address. Heritage was jailed for 12 years at Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa yesterday, pleading guilty to two charges of raping the boy. The boy went out trick-or-treating with friends and when they separated at 6.45pm he set off to walk home, where he was expected by 7pm. But he felt a knife in his back as Heritage told him: ‘Don't make noise or I'll kill you’, prosecutor Aliya Rashid said. The boy tried to get his phone to dial 999, but Heritage snatched it from him and, threatening to kill him if he moved, held the knife to his neck and ordered him to walk. When the boy stopped, he told him to keep moving and pulled him onto the driveway of a house where he ordered the boy to take off his clothes. At that moment the boy's phone rang and Heritage handed it to him. He told him to tell his mother he would be two hours and to hang up, which he did. His mother called back, but he again said he would be home in two hours and hung up, after which Heritage told him to turn off his phone. In the darkness the boy asked Heritage 'why me?' and asked what he was going to do, at which Heritage said he was going to have sex with him. The boy pleaded with him to stop but Heritage sexually assaulted and raped him. Heritage gave the boy his home address, before letting him go and telling him to visit the next day. Sentence: Heritage was jailed for 12 years at Warwickshire Justice Centre (pictured) in Leamington Spa . The boy told his parents what happened and the police arrested Heritage at his home that night. Heritage admitted what he had done and said he was 'eight out of ten drunk' after going to a funeral. He said he had then gone home, got a knife and went out looking for someone to sexually assault, explaining that he 'would prefer a girl, but didn't mind'. Asked why, he said it was because he felt 'left out' because everyone else was doing it. Mrs Rashid added that as a result of . his ordeal, the boy says he is now scared to go out in the dark, has . flashbacks which makes it difficult for him to sleep and finds it . difficult to concentrate at school. Denis . Desmond, defending, said there was a psychiatric report on Heritage . which made it clear he had 'significant learning difficulties'. He pointed out that Heritage had no . previous convictions and, having acted 'completely out of character, had . made full admissions at the police station'. 'He had been abducted from the street and you used a knife to press home your attack. The extent of the damage to the boy is unknown, but will be lasting' Judge Marten Coates . Heritage had also admitted kidnapping the boy, causing him to take part in sexual activity and possessing a knife. Jailing Heritage, Judge Marten Coates, said: ‘The aggravating features are that there was premeditation and planning on your part, and the attack was sustained. ‘He had been abducted from the street and you used a knife to press home your attack. The extent of the damage to the boy is unknown, but will be lasting.’ The judge ordered him to register as a sex offender for life and imposed a sexual offences prevention order banning him from having unsupervised contact with children. He also banned him from ever doing any paid or unpaid work which could bring him into contact with children.","Simon Heritage, 38, of Coventry, was arrested within hours of sex attack .

"By . John Lee and John Breslin . UPDATED: . 22:04 EST, 20 August 2011 . More than $400m of compensation to American victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests was paid with loans and guarantees from Allied Irish Bank, it has ben revealed. The funds, in the form of loans, guarantees and lines of credit, were given specifically to pay clerical abuse victims, and led to AIB being dubbed the 'Vatican's banking arm' in U.S. legal circles. The revelation that a comparatively small Irish bank based on another continent was used to pay off victims will raise questions about AIB's links to the church. Corrosive links: Allied Irish Bank became known as the 'Vatican's banking arm' in U.S. legal circles . One of the payments, of $250m to the Los Angeles diocese, emerged in a new book entitled 'Render Unto Rome: The Secret Life of Money in the Catholic Church', by Jason Berry, which outlines extraordinary links between the bank and the church. But an investigation by the MoS has established that in a few short months in 2007 AIB emerged as the lender behind abuse settlements for four separate dioceses, and the true figure was almost twice as high. It also emerges that while AIB was used to pay the bulk of the Church's abuse claims, the dioceses were able to hold on to most of their properties. Berry also claims that out of 194 Catholic dioceses in America, 45 banked with AIB. In the book, he asks: 'Was AIB a pass-through for Vatican funds to help certain dioceses while others had no such advantage?' Many American dioceses, confronted in recent years with compensation cases, have filed for bankruptcy and negotiated settlements with victims. But instead of being funded by the Vatican, which is fighting court cases by denying any legal responsibility to pay, almost half a billion of the money paid out in America was borrowed from AIB in Dublin. Top men: The then- Allied Irish Banks director Eugene Sheehy, left, and the chairman of AIB at the time was Dermot Gleeson, right . Many other agreements may have been made out of court, in secret. The MOS has confirmed that all of the loans were agreed by the bank's headquarters in Dublin, and amount to as much as a quarter of AIB's €2bn exposure in America the following year. The MoS has also discovered that the loans are now being quietly repaid. In a revelation that will prompt further questions about whether the Vatican is behind the international deals, the supposedly-indebted dioceses have begun to pay off the AIB debts with money from other, unnamed, institutions. Just last month a $40m line of credit to the Diocese of Portland in Oregon was taken over by an un-named creditor. Bob Krebs, a spokesman for the diocese for many years, declined to name the new lender. Asked why AIB had been used to help fund its abuse compensation cases, he said he did not know who 'found Allied Irish for us'. Of the deals, by far the largest line of credit was for Los Angeles, for $256m. The diocese avoided going into court with abuse victims by reaching a settlement in advance. Teen victim: Esther Miller was abused by a young deacon in Los Angeles . It emerged afterwards that AIB loans and guarantees accounted for almost half of total settlement. The deal included $175m in cash and another $25m to pay the interest, and helped Los Angeles avoid selling the bulk of its properties or reveal the true value of its total assets. In San Diego AIB gave cash and credit of some $100m, almost half the $198m paid out to 144 victims. That diocese filed for bankruptcy on the eve of the first civil trial against it, a case involving Monsignor Patrick O'Keeffe, originally from Kilkenny. The Diocese of Portland, in Oregon, also filed for bankruptcy because of compensation actions. Of a $129m settlement for victims $40m came from AIB. The loan effectively allowed the diocese to close the bankruptcy proceedings without selling any assets. A loan document obtained by this paper details the loans in Portland. On AIB headed paper, it details how the loans were being specifically made to trusts set up to pay known and future abuse claims for the diocese. The letter was written one day before a similar letter giving credit to the Diocese of Los Angeles, again signed by its LA-based senior vice president Charles Lydon and London-based vice president John McGrath. U.S. lawyer Jim Stang, who sat on nine bankruptcy committees charged with looking after victim creditors, said: 'We joke that AIB is the bank of the Catholic Church.' The bank is still exposed on some of the loans. It is owed almost $10m by the diocese of Wilmington in Delaware. An AIB spokesman said: 'AIB's business focus in America was in the 'Not for Profit' areas and this included churches. 'Any loans advanced were approved in accordance with AIBGroup policy.' An AIB source said they were 'standard commercial loans'. A spokesman for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles said the allegation of Vatican involvement 'is complete rubbish'. 'The Archdiocese initiated the loan discussions with AIB and other potential lenders in the summer of 2007. An arrangement was closed with AIB in November 2007,' he said. 'Settlement related financing was undertaken as a way to allow an orderly liquidation of surplus assets by the Archdiocese, and provided time for the Archdiocese to formulate a post-settlement recovery plan. Financing arrangements with AIB or any other potential lender had no impact on the settlement timing or terms. The AIB loan was repaid in full during the 2011 fiscal year.' By John BreslinEsther Miller was a teenager living in Los Angeles when she was repeatedly forced to commit sexual acts with a priest who went on to abuse other young girls. That period in her life still haunts her as she enters her fifties. The man who abused her – a young deacon still at seminary college – groomed her by getting close to her parents. Over the course of two years, until she was 17, the priest forced himself on her. He was later appointed principal of a Catholic high school despite questions over his behaviour. He told Esther to go to confession, but only to a particular priest. He called her evil. He later turned out to be a serial abuser of boys too. She mentioned some details of the encounters to her mother, who slapped her and told her never to speak ill of the clergy. The abuse had a profound effect on the next two decades of Esther’s life. She was married four times and had dozens of jobs. Only after the revelations in the Boston diocese in 2002 did she set off on the long road to forcing the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to reveal what it knew. Esther’s case was one of hundreds, which were finally settled in mid 2007 for $660m. ‘I was surprised at the dollar amount. I had no idea of the insurance and other ways of raising money.’ And she had no idea until this week that Allied Irish Bank had helpfully stepped in with guarantees of hundreds of millions. The deal allowed the Archdiocese to avoid going to court and opening all its documents to scrutiny.","Allied Irish Bank behind pay-outs for four U.S. dioceses in 2007 .

But finally – after a private prosecution, landmark public inquiry, years of police investigations  and a murder conviction – Gary Dobson has admitted his guilt. The 37-year-old yesterday abandoned his appeal against that conviction – a development that raises hopes of him turning ‘supergrass’. Why's that then? Gary Dobson (left) has dropped his appeal against his murder conviction for killing Stephen Lawrence (right) Detectives are expected to consider visiting him in prison to urge him to turn in the rest of the gang that killed Stephen in 1993. David Norris, the second murderer jailed last year, is continuing with plans to appeal against his conviction but police are confident the 36-year-old gangster’s son will fail. Dobson’s decision was welcomed by Stephen’s mother Doreen. In a moving statement, she spoke of the ‘pain and heartbreak’ of the years she has spent waiting for his confession. Mrs Lawrence said: ‘It took me and my family almost 20 years to get justice for my son Stephen when Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of the murder in January 2012. ‘In those years I had put my grieving on hold and had to struggle against police racism. It would have been a great comfort to me and my family if Gary Dobson or his accomplices had admitted what they had done. ‘Now that Gary Dobson has dropped his appeal I can only assume it is because he has finally admitted he murdered Stephen. ‘He could have done this much earlier and avoided the pain and heartache me and my family have had to suffer over so many years. ‘I now hope that David Norris will do the same and avoid prolonging my pain. I also hope that those others who were involved on the 22nd April 1993 follow Gary Dobson’s lead and admit their own involvement.’ Dobson’s decision is a huge boost to Mrs Lawrence and her family as they prepare for a memorial service that will mark exactly two decades since Stephen’s murder. And it is likely to re-energise the Metropolitan Police’s marathon quest to lock up the entire gang of five suspected of stabbing the 18-year-old to death in Eltham, South-East London. Yesterday, a senior Scotland Yard detective said the inquiry remains ‘live and active’. The Daily Mail has campaigned for 16 years for justice for Stephen. In February 1997, we published pictures of the five suspects – including Dobson and Norris – under the headline ‘Murderers’ and challenged them to sue us if we were wrong. No legal action was ever taken. We repeated the same front page in July 2006, and yet again none of the race-hate yobs issued proceedings. Our acclaimed campaign exposed police failings and led to the setting up of a public inquiry that branded the Met ‘institutionally racist’. Behind bars: David Norris is continuing to fight against his conviction for the1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence . It also sparked legal changes that allowed Dobson, previously acquitted of Stephen’s murder, to stand trial again. After both were found guilty in . January last year, Dobson was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years and . two months, while Norris was given a minimum of 14 years and three . months. Father-of-two . Dobson and Norris, who has five children from various relationships, . were finally trapped following an expert review of forensic evidence . from the original investigation. Fibres and hairs linked them to their . victim. Dobson’s appeal focused on challenging the integrity of the forensic evidence. Ever since his conviction, his legal team has tried in vain to undermine its credibility. Sources . say Norris is appealing on the basis that the use in evidence of a . surveillance video showing him to be racist was unfair. Last summer, . applications for permission to appeal by both men were rejected by a . single judge who considered the papers from the case. But Dobson and Norris still had the right to renew their applications before judges sitting at the Court of Appeal. A spokesman for the Judicial Office confirmed yesterday that Dobson had shelved his appeal. He . could receive a significant reduction in his prison sentence if he . testifies against fellow, unconvicted members of the murder gang. Police . believe they have exhausted all opportunities to gather new forensic . evidence in the Lawrence case, meaning their best chance of nailing the . other gang members is if a new witness comes forward – or Dobson tells . the truth. Because he . pleaded not guilty at his trial, Dobson would have to come up with . compelling new evidence to have any chance of a sentence reduction. In . 1994, Stephen’s family brought a failed private prosecution against . Dobson and Norris and brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight. Dobson . and Norris are believed to have spent up to £1million of public money . on defence costs before and during their murder trial. But the Legal . Services Commission has blocked a request for information as to how . much.

'I think we have learned that athletes . are different from us in some ways,' said University of Illinois . psychology professor Arthur Kramer, who . led the study with graduate student Heloisa Alves. Juliana Silva of Brazil: Experts studied the 87 top-ranked Brazilian volleyball players, some medalists in the Beijing and London Olympics, and found they excelled in how fast their brains take in and respond to new information . 'We found that athletes were . generally able to inhibit behavior, to stop quickly when they had to, . which is very important in sport and in daily life,' Kramer said. 'They were also able to activate, to . pick up information from a glance and to switch between tasks more . quickly than nonathletes. 'I would say these were modest differences, but they were interesting differences nonetheless.' Overall, the athletes were faster at memory tests and tasks that required them to switch between tasks. They were quicker to notice things in their peripheral vision and to detect subtle changes in a scene. And in general, they were better able to accomplish tasks while ignoring confusing or irrelevant information. The team also found that being an athlete minimizes the performance differences that normally occur between women and men. Emanuel Rego and Ricardo Santos (R) of Brazil : Researchers also found that being an athlete minimizes the performance differences that normally occur between women and men . Female athletes, the researchers . found, were more like their male peers in the speed of their mental . calculations and reaction times, while nonathletic females performed the . same tasks more slowly than their male counterparts. The study appears in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, and the researchers say they are still unsure if the skills or learnt, or athletes were born with them. 'Our understanding is imperfect because . we don't know whether these abilities in the athletes were 'born' or . 'made,' "" he said. 'Perhaps people gravitate to these sports because . they're good at both. 'Or perhaps it's the training that enhances their . cognitive abilities as well as their physical ones. 'My intuition is that . it's a little bit of both.'","Experts studied the 87 top-ranked .

Police were embroiled in a row today after they allowed an Olympic star to fire a Taser for a publicity stunt. Officers were accused of breaking the law by allowing hockey player Sally Walton to blast a tin-foil target with the fearsome 50,000 volt weapon. The resulting footage and photographs were proudly placed on West Midlands Police’s website to promote its work with women officers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Publicity stunt gone wrong: Sally Walton is shown how to use the Taser gun during the training day . But they were hurriedly removed after police chiefs learned of the stunt amid fears that their staff had broken the law. Taser stun guns are classified as a firearm and it is illegal for anyone to possess one unless they are a police officer or ‘Crown servant’. Tough laws designed to prevent the spread of potentially lethal weapons mean anyone caught with a firearm faces a minimum five year jail sentence. One critic said he was 'astonished' that a celebrity had been allowed to fire a Taser and said police may well have broken the law. Put through her paces: Olympian Sally Walton was allowed to fire the a Taser which could have broken the law . West Midlands Police dispute that Miss Walton broke the law as she was 'fully supervised' when she used the gun . Sally Walton was part of the womens' field hockey team who beat New Zealand 3-1 to claim bronze at the London Olympics . Richard Taylor, a Cambridge-based campaigner who has examined the use of the weapons, suggested police are becoming 'complacent' about their use. He said: 'Strict safeguards are in place which ought to control the police use of weapons. 'Police officers need to be authorised to carry Taser weapons, members of the public shouldn't be getting their hands on them under any circumstances.' But West Midlands Police dispute that Miss Walton broke the law as she was ‘fully supervised’ when she used the gun. The incident came amid mounting concern about the increased use of Taser weapons by police officers across the country. Many forces are ramping up the number of officers allowed to use them and investing in extra equipment claiming it will make police and the public safer. But critics have expressed fears that the weapons are being used inappropriately and in trivial confrontations that could be resolved without force. The Daily Mail has revealed how . prisoners have been Tasered for refusing to remove their underwear and . several cyclists have also been shot. Miss . Walton, a member of Team GB’s bronze medal winning hockey team, joined . police officers for a training day at an training indoor centre. One critic said he was 'astonished' that a celebrity had been allowed to fire a Taser and said police may well have broken the law . The Olympian was allowed to blast a tin-foil target with the 50,000 volt weapon during the training day . Miss Walton later wrote on Twitter that she had enjoyed her day with West Midlands Police . She swapped her hockey stick for a baton as she confronted violent ‘criminals’, smashed a door down and was petrol bombed during a mock riot. The 28-year-old was also filmed as she examined and fired a live Taser weapon, of the same kind worn by officers on the streets. Referring to the red laser dot sight, a burly instructor tells her to ‘take the safety off and then you can light someone up’. Olympian: Sally Walton, left, celebrates with Hannah Macleod after scoring a goal against Japan during their women's hockey competition preliminary round match at the 2012 Olympics . Sparks can then be seen as she discharges a five second burst of electricity into a tin-foil target in the shape of a person. Under the Firearms Act 1968 a Taser is defined as a prohibited weapon, alongside other stun guns and CS gas canisters. It states that a Taser can only be possessed by someone ‘authorised by the Secretary of State’, in this case Home Secretary Teresa May. The only exemptions are the police or ‘other persons in the service of the Crown’, for example personnel in the Armed Forces. Anyone found with an unauthorised firearm faces a minimum five year jail sentence, except in exceptional circumstances. Experts said the question of whether Miss Walton has committed a crime is a ‘grey area’ and it is extremely unlikely she would be prosecuted. This is because the definition of ‘possessing’ the weapon is ambiguous and because she was on police premises and under close supervision at the time. Speaking afterwards she said: ‘I . think it helped, obviously accuracy is massive in my sport … it was . useful and it was good to transfer my skills into this.’ Miss Walton, who lives in Solihull, posted pictures of her brandishing and firing the Taser on her personal Facebook page. She later wrote on Twitter that she ‘enjoyed every minute of it’ and offered her services to her local police team. But West Midlands Police quickly changed its publicity photographs and video to remove all references to the Taser. Mr Taylor added: 'I don't think we should be glamorising police use of Tasers or firearms. 'Use of force by the police must be proportionate and a last resort. 'I want to continue to live in a country where the police are largely unarmed and proud of their restraint when it comes to using the weapons they do have available to them. 'I think showing off their Tasers in celebrity videos would be completely at odds with the culture of policing we have, and which I would like to see maintained.' Assistant Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: ‘West Midlands Police was happy to host local Olympian Sally Walton at a recent public order training event to demonstrate the rigorous training that officers undergo in order to carry out their varied range of duties. ‘During this time, Sally was given the opportunity to use a Taser whilst being carefully guided and directed by a highly-trained Taser instructor in a safe, controlled environment. ‘At all times Sally was wearing protective equipment and fully supervised by a specialist instructor. ‘Sally used the firearm in a safe, controlled environment at the discretion of the officers on the day we do not accept that it was an ‘illegal’ use.’ The Home Office confirmed that West Midlands Police did not obtain any special dispensation to allow Miss Walton to use the weapon. A spokesman said under the Firearms Act Tasers can only be possessed by someone authorised by the Secretary of State, except police and people ‘in the service of the Crown’. Miss Walton said: ‘It was a privilege to join West Midlands Police for the day and showcase the work carried out by officers.’ The hockey player made her international debut in 2005 and has gone on to win more than 100 caps for England and Great Britain. The defender was part of the womens’ field hockey team who beat New Zealand 3-1 to claim bronze at the London Olympics.","Sally Walton allowed to blast target with the 50,000 volt weapon .

The British father who died with his son on Mont Blanc was  yesterday criticised for going on a perilous hike with the wrong equipment. Peter Saunders, 48, plunged to his death with 12-year-old Charlie after trekking along a precipitous, snow and  ice-covered path on Western Europe’s highest mountain. They fell up to 1,000ft after slipping on the treacherous trail overlooking the vast  Bossons Glacier, near Chamonix. Peter (left) and Charlie (right)  Saunders were wearing shoes fit for the summer when they fell to their deaths . EXCLUSIVE PICTURE: The helicopter rescue of Peter and Charlie Saunders who died whilst . walking in Chamonix on Saturday afternoon. The pictures show one of the . victims being winched with a rescuer aboard the rescue helicopter with . the Glacier des Bossons as a backdrop . The bodies of the father and son were found after a photo taken of them earlier in the day was used to locate them . Yesterday professional guides questioned why the pair, from Buckingham, ventured out without ropes, crampons and ice axes. Robert Beale, a British mountain . guide based in Chamonix, said: ‘You’ve got to ask yourself, “Would you . really want to take your 12-year-old son up a trail covered in snow and . ice to look at a glacier? Is it a sensible thing to do?” ‘The father was foolish at best to attempt that ascent with his son. Things can go wrong very quickly on the mountain.’ Mountain expert Jean-Louis Verdier . added: ‘They should have had crampons, ice axes and been roped together . to make their way across the hard-packed snow that covers these slopes.’ The pair had arrived only hours earlier, flying into Geneva and then hiring a car, for a ‘weekend of adventure’. Earlier this month no fewer than 10 people - including mountaineers and off-piste skiers - died in the Mont Blanc area . Tragedy: They plunged down a mountain at . Chamonix-Mont-Blanc . Mr Verdier, a professional guide and a . Chamonix councillor responsible for mountain security, described the . pair’s footwear – summer hiking boots – as like ‘trainers with modified . soles’. He added: ‘The father, Mr Saunders, . made a terrible error. They simply got off the plane and raced straight . up the mountain without asking advice and without the right equipment.’ Chamonix Mayor, Eric Fournier, added: . ‘They should not have attempted that hike which is not sign-posted in . winter. If they had taken the trouble to ask for advice from the . mountain centre, we would have told them not to go. We would have . offered them a different route.’ The trail they were attempting to . follow – ‘La Jonction’ – begins in the valley close to the entrance of . the Mont Blanc tunnel and climbs through thick woodland. Captain Patrice Ribes of the French Mountain Police said: ‘This is the real mountain. The tragic pair died in the popular skiing destination of Chamonix in the French Alps . ‘There is no rope to hold on to and the signs, which are clearly visible in the summer, are now completely covered in snow. ‘It is inconceivable that someone . would attempt this route in winter. There is ice everywhere and it is . impossible to stick to the trail because of the snow. ‘No one uses this trail until the end of spring – when the snow has melted.’ He added that accident investigators were examining the theory that the pair had turned back after getting into difficulties. Mr Saunders, a businessman, rang . police at 2.55pm on Saturday to tell them Charlie had fallen into a . gully and he could not see him. The father is believed to have lost his own footing minutes later as he frantically searched for his son. The Britons’ bodies were found on Sunday morning, lying 150ft apart in the deep Couloir des  Pyramides gully. Charlie’s mother, Sandra, 44, and his sister Kate, 15, paid tribute to the pair in a statement released by the Foreign Office. It said: ‘Charlie was always full of life, had a really happy temperament and loved spending time with his father. ‘Peter was fantastic at making things happen, resourceful, with a positive approach to life. ‘They will both be sorely missed by friends and family alike.’ At 15,780ft, Mont Blanc is notoriously dangerous and features some of the most technically difficult climbs in the world. So far, ten skiers and mountaineers have been killed in the area this month. The father and son are thought to . have reached a high altitude by taking the chair lift from Bossons . village to the approaches of the Bossons Glacier, at 1400m. From . there, they are thought to have set off on the well-known La Jonction . (Junction) hike, which is hugely popular with tourists, especially in . the summer months. La . Jonction is a rocky spur from which hikers can look out towards the . Bossons and Taconnaz glaciers. It was is on the route taken by the . Frenchmen who first ascended Mont Blanc in 1786. The . slopes around Mont Blanc, the highest peak in western Europe, are . notoriously dangerous, with scores of mountaineers, skiers and hikers . dying on them every year. Not . only is the fabled ‘White Mountain’ 15,780 feet high, but the climbs . around it are some of the most technically difficult in the world. Despite this, it is often mistakenly claimed that people can enjoy an easy stroll up the slopes.Hundreds . set off on paths every day without ice axes or crampons, let alone . other basic equipment like extra food supplies and tents. Many of the 20,000-plus people who attempt to reach the summit each year are inexperienced or completely novice climbers.

A former Pennsylvania pastor has been sentenced to life in prison . without parole in the fatal bludgeoning of his second wife in 2008. Arthur 'A.B.' Schirmer was sentenced in Monroe County Court on Monday, nearly . two months after a jury convicted him of first-degree murder in the . death of Betty Schirmer. The conviction brought an automatic life . sentence. Prosecutors say he clubbed his wife on the . head with a crowbar, then loaded her into their car and staged a . low-speed accident in an effort to conceal the crime. Schirmer is also charged with killing his first wife, Jewel Schirmer, in 1999. He awaits trial in that case. In September, a grand jury concluded that he killed both women with blunt objects. Jewel Schirmer, 50, died at Hershey Medical Center of a traumatic brain injury from an alleged fall down a flight of stairs. Schirmer said he came home on April 23, . 1999, to find Jewel lying at the bottom of some steps and bleeding from . the head. She died the next day. Police . and prosecutors reopened the probe after her husband came under . investigation in the 2008 death of his second wife, Betty, in the Pocono . Mountains.

Police later said the damage to the . car was too minor to have caused an injury that produced as much blood . as paramedics found in the car. Last year a Lebanon County grand jury cited medical testimony that revealed Schirmer used blunt objects to kill both his wives.

A woman who escaped from Warren Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints cult has told how couples are banned from having sex, as she showed off images of the moment she was reunited with her children. The revelation came after a former member of his church was able to escape from the cult along with her six children. Ruby Jessop was just 14-years-old when . she was deemed 'sexually mature' by polygamous sect leader Jeffs and . forced to marry her second cousin Haven Barlow. Just days ago, she was finally reunited with her six children after the state's attorney general intervened and prevented Barlow from keeping them away from her. Happy to be together: With the help of state police officials, Ruby Jessop was recently reunited with her six children . Former family: Jessop's estranged husband Haven Barlow (left) tried to keep the children from her . Freedom: Ruby Jessop spoke for the first time since she was able to run away from the control of the FLDS . She told a CNN reporter . that over the last year, husbands and wives were not allowed to have . any form of intimate contact because of the edict. 'The only relations you could have with your husband was a handshake and no longer than three seconds,' she told CNN. Jeffs, who heads the FLDS Church, reportedly said that . married men and women were not to have sexual relations with one another . until he says otherwise because he does 'not want any child to be born . in this wicked generation'. Ruby, now 26, managed to escape from the sick and twisted sect last month and has now been granted temporary custody of the children aged from two to ten, who were being held 'hostage' by the group, her sister said. Polygamist Warren Steed Jeffs before he was sentenced to life in prison on bigamy and child sex charges (left) and in court (right) but he still exerts control on his followers using the local police force . Escape: Ruby said that she was forced to marry her husband Haven Barlow (center) when she was 14-years-old, even though he is her second cousin . The religious group is divided between . the sister towns of Colorado City, Arizona- where Ruby lived in a . walled compound- and Hilldale, Utah located just across the state line. Because . Colorado City is an incorporated township, there have been many . complaints that the local police force- dubbed The Marshalls- are . effectively security guards who enforce Jeffs' laws and help him . maintain control even though he is behind bars facing child sex assault . charges. There is now a . criminal probe investigating the Marshall's office as the state's . attorney general asserts that there are many more young mothers in . Ruby's situation who are being forced to stay in their suppressive . relationships. Priorities: Now Ruby is going to move on with her life and hopefully retain legal guardianship of her six young children . 'What they . do is say, ""Everybody watch her so she won’t run away."" Then she can’t . leave. Women who wanted to escape have been forcibly held by the . marshals against their will,' attorney general Tom Horne said. Attorneys for the two towns and the Marshal’s Office adamantly denied the charges, calling Horne’s words 'inflammatory'. Lawyer . Blake Hamilton said: 'I can’t speak for the FLDS but the bottom line is . the Marshal’s Office absolutely does not hold people against their . will.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:05 EST, 21 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:06 EST, 21 March 2013 . A man charged with killing a woman and raping her 10-year-old daughter after a carjacking at a New York mall last week was able to remove his court-ordered electronic monitoring bracelet before carrying out the brutal attacks. A senior probation officer told a New York court earlier this week that David Renz, 29, managed to cut the device from his ankle and put it back together so quickly that it didn't prompt BI, the company in Colorado that makes the monitors, to notify court officers in Syracuse. Now an expert in offender tracking technologies has spoken out to say the blame in this case lies not with the tracking device, but with the protocols of the pretrial unit assigned to monitor Renz. Expert George Drake denies that the GPS device could have been at fault in the case of David Renz, right, who has been charged with first-degree rape, murder and kidnapping, as well as second-degree murder . ‘As soon as the ankle bracelet comes off . the ankle, it creates an event. But the pretrial services in Syracuse . decided, for some reason, to not make it an alert unless an event . persisted for some period of time,’ said George Drake, president of corrections technology firm Correct Tech. ‘There was a hole in the security fence and someone found it and walked right through it,’ Drake told ABCNews. ‘They should close that hole.’ In the federal court system, 51,170 defendants have been supervised on pretrial relief in the past 12 months, with nearly 9,000 defendants placed on electronic monitoring. Drake said in the vast majority of those cases a GPS bracelet is a perfectly acceptable means of monitoring suspects but it had been a bad choice in the case of Renz. According to Chief U.S. Probation Officer Matt Brown, officers had told BI not to notify them when the ankle monitor's signal was interrupted for a short period of time because the officers had been getting tampering alerts every time the devices were knocked against bathtubs or walls. ‘We finally figured out that the circuit can be interrupted because of something as simple and innocent as that,’ Brown told Syracuse.com. Since the incident BI has admitted to Brown that this isn’t the first time someone had tampered with one of its monitors this way. The company’s contract is being reviewed by the U.S. Office of Probation and Pretrial Services in Washington as a result of this incident. A tracking device similar to the one Renz removed from this ankle on Thursday evening before he allegedly killed a school librarian and raped a 10-year-old girl . Probation officers . didn’t know Renz had slipped their leash until more than two hours . after state police say he attacked school librarian Lori Bresnahan and . her daughter outside Great Northern Mall, tied up Bresnahan, raped the . girl, stabbed Bresnahan in her car and fled on foot as the girl ran . away. When . Renz was arrested shortly after police said he killed Bresnahan, he was . not wearing the ankle monitor, which he had left at his home to prevent . it from sounding an alarm. There . was no alert to probation officers from BI until 11:30 p.m. That only . occurred because the monitor hadn’t moved in more than four hours. At . 12:30 Friday morning, state police alerted Brown that Renz had been . arrested. In 2003, BI, also known as 'Behavioral Interventions,' was found to be partly responsible for the death of a Texas woman who . was killed by an ex-boyfriend who snipped off his ankle bracelet. BI . paid the woman’s family $200,000, according to news reports. Renz was beaten and suffered a broken nose during his first night in jail, authorities said. When he appeared in federal court on Friday to face a probation violation charge, he had a swollen face and tissues stuffed up both nostrils. His attorneys, James Greenwald and Kenneth Moynihan, said Renz was assaulted by other inmates at the Onondaga County Justice Center, where he was taken following his arrest. Sheriff Kevin Walsh said he was looking into why Renz was put into a holding area with other prisoners - not the usual practice in holding someone facing such accusations. Suspect: New York State Police lead David Renz out of the North Syracuse state police barracks Friday, March 15, 2013. Renz, 29, abducted a school librarian and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class . Walsh said Renz has been segregated from other prisoners and is being watched around the clock. 'We're dealing with a man who is innocent until proven guilty,' he said. 'He's got to be protected.' Renz . was arraigned Friday morning at a court in East Syracuse on charges . that he abducted the mother and daughter as they left a gymnastics class . in the Syracuse suburb of Clay. Police said Renz raped the girl and stabbed the mother to death before fleeing into some woods. The 10-year-old girl escaped and was found by a passing motorist, who dialed 911. Renz was captured a short time later. He had abducted the school librarian . and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class at a mall in the . Syracuse suburb of Clay, about 150 miles west of Albany, on Thursday . night. Renz bound both victims, raped the girl and . drove a short distance to a spot where the girl escaped and was found by . a passing motorist, troopers said. The motorist told 911 dispatchers he saw a . man running away from the scene, allowing police to quickly send in . officers on the ground and a sheriff's helicopter in the air. Renz was . caught a short time later near a wooded area. They believe . Renz tied up the woman and the girl and then raped the 10-year-old in a . deserted area of the mall parking lot shortly before 9pm on March 14. It was unclear how the girl escaped or when her mother was killed, authorities said. Police . are still piecing together the timeline of the crime, but their best . guess is that after assaulting the girl, Renz drove down a nearby rural . road. Crime scene: New York State Police investigate a car involved in a fatal carjacking on Verplank Road, Clay, N.Y . That’s where they think the woman, 47, who worked at an elementary school, was stabbed to death. The . girl managed to escape the scene and run down the road and was aided by . a passing driver. The child's name has not been released. The girl sustained injuries from the attack and is currently being treated at a hospital. Her mother died from multiple stab wounds. Police seem sure, however, that the suspect did not know the victims personally. Following his court appearance, the 29-year-old suspect was returned to jail, but placed into protective custody. Renz is also being guarded for now, but he will not be transferred to a different facility. The 29-year-old had been charged in . January with possession of child pornography and allowed to remain free . under terms that included staying off the internet and away from places . including schools, parks and arcades. He lost his job at a supermarket, . moved in with his mother and hadn't been able to find other work after . his arrest, according to court documents. According . to an FBI criminal complaint, agents who went to the North Syracuse . apartment where Renz was living in June found in his bedroom four . computers that he told them he used to view adult pornography. Agent . Alix Skelton said Renz eventually admitted using the internet for the . past six years to download child porn to a drive on one of the machines, . which he turned over to the agents. Technicians determined in November . that it had an encrypted hard drive, and Skelton said Renz provided the . encryption key. Agents . reviewing the drive in December found about 100 gigabytes of child porn . comprising more than 500 videos and more than 3,000 images, according to . the complaint. Among the . images were two showing sex acts involving prepubescent girls, said . Skelton, a member of a unit that targets people involved in online . exploitation of children. Renz was charged on January 9 in federal court with possession of child pornography. On Jan. 29, a judge granted a prosecutor's request for an extension of the time required for grand jury action so investigators could continue going over 'numerous items of electric media' for additional evidence. Renz, who authorities said had no prior police record, was released after agreeing to stay at home at night with an electronic monitor and away from any place he might encounter children. Late Friday afternoon, state police turned Renz over to federal authorities, who will hold him for violating the terms of his release, court documents said. Duncan said the cases against him will continue in federal and state courts. In an interview with Syracuse.com on Friday, a former manager and trainer of David Renz described him as a courteous and intelligent employee who had worked at the James Street Wegmans since his teens. The manager recalled that the 29-year-old was always willing to help customers and was 'trusted' by his superiors.","Suspect David Renz was arrested in January on child porn charges .

She was clutching the label from her underwear and was very excited. ‘Look, Daddy!’ she beamed. ‘There’s a lovely story in my pants!’ The ‘lovely story’ was, in fact, a four-inch long, flapping label covered in writing. You may well have noticed the same thing with an item of clothing you’ve bought recently. Made of a man-made fibre, it tends to make you itch, often leaving a red mark on your skin. Its length means it’s often visible through the fabric. Sometimes there are up to four labels joined together. The answer, usually, is to cut it off. Up to scratch: Clothes labels are to get longer and wordier . The reason for this unwanted piece of material is the fact that many High Street clothing firms now sell their products to a large number of countries. Thus they use the same label — describing the material and washing instructions in up to ten different languages. So you will get the word ‘cotton’, for example, translated into Slovenian, Italian, Portuguese, Estonian etc. That is precisely the case with our daughter’s underwear. Mothercare, where we bought the garment, sells the same product across Europe. If it makes things easier for them, and does not inconvenience customers, who can have any complaint? But soon it may be impossible to buy a garment without such a label. From next year, it’s likely that almost every item of clothing you buy will contain a label with 23 languages. Yes, you’ve guessed it. This madness is the brainchild of the European Union. EU Directive number 1007/2011 was quietly passed 18 months ago and is officially due to come into force in 2014. To give it its full title, the directive is on ‘Textile Fibre Names and Related Labelling and Marking of the Fibre Composition of Textile Products’. In typical Brussels gobbledegook, it states that ‘the labelling or marking [of clothes] shall be provided in the official language or languages of the Member State on the territory of which the textile products are made available to the consumer, unless the Member State concerned provides otherwise’. Official languages: Clothing will be labelled in the languages of all EU Member States unless they opt out . In plain English, it means that any product sold in, say, Germany must have labels written in German; any sold in Estonia must be in Estonian; anything sold in Poland must be in Polish, and so on. Although not due to be introduced for several months, the directive is already having an effect on the British clothing industry. John Miln, chief executive of the clothing industry trade body, the UK Fashion And Textile Association, says the result will be that clothing sold in this country will have labels that identify the fibres in 23 languages. Mr Miln says: ‘If you’re making 10,000 shirts, it makes no financial sense to keep stopping the production line after every few hundred items to put new labels in.’ In any case, at that stage in production, you may well not know whether this particular shirt is destined for Belgium or Bulgaria. ‘All the companies I have spoken to think this is nuts,’ says Mr Miln. ‘As for customers with smaller garments that fit tightly against the body, a large label is offensive.’ Drapers, the fashion industry newspaper, reports that one wholesaler has been told by retailers that they may not be able to accept deliveries that do not already comply with the regulation. For under the rules, it will be the retailer who is legally responsible — and some of the clothing being delivered to shops now might still be on shelves in 2014. Undoubtedly, the new rule is bound to befuddle many customers when confronted by washing instructions for their new jumper which are written in Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German and Swedish. 'Silly': UKIP MEP Roger Helmer asks: 'Where do you stop? in covering all the European languages . Roger Helmer, UKIP MEP for the East Midlands, says: ‘Frequently, in many of these languages the word is virtually the same. But people tend to be terribly defensive about language, and if there’s a one-letter difference in the spelling, they want to know: “Why is it in your language and not my language?”’ In any case, he asks, will the EU stop at 23 languages? Only 300,000 people speak Maltese, which is an official language of the EU, while around 10 million speak Catalan, which is not.‘Where do you stop?’ asks Mr Helmer. ‘The whole thing just becomes silly.’ The MEP first became aware of the issue when he visited a sock factory in his constituency and the owner told him that customers in Germany are already saying they wouldn’t accept any more stock without the new-style labels. Mr Helmer says: ‘They were faced with the dilemma, and cost, of having to take it apart, attach new labels and repackage it.’ Another firm that imports a well-known brand of shirt from the Far East told Mr Helmer that the directive meant it had to take the shirts apart, attach the new multi-language labels and then sew them back together. Clearly, the problem is widespread. When I asked more than half a dozen household-name British clothes companies about the problem, not one of them wanted to speak publicly about the new rules. Most declined even to issue an official ‘no comment’. A spokesman for Marks & Spencer said: ‘Our clothing care labels currently carry advice in 12 languages. We’re now working with our suppliers to assess the implications of the new European legislation and the actions we need to take.’ Not surprisingly, much lobbying is going on to try to get the directive repealed, or for a dispensation that will allow the 23-language labels to be in the form of a peel-off sticker. The UK Fashion And Textile Association has told the European Commission that it plans to go ahead with stickers unless it hears that they would be unlawful. It has not had a reply. Meanwhile, John Miln is resigned to the fact that it will soon be almost impossible to sell a woollen jumper without it carrying a label declaring it to be ‘laine’, ‘wolle’, ‘uld’, ‘villa’ and so on. And we clothes buyers will have to be resigned to more unsightly, long labels and more itches on our skin.","Almost every item will contain labels in 23 languages .

A man who won the lottery twice, scooping over £1.16 million in total, joked that he was not 'that bothered' by the wins and wanted more. George Traykov beat odds of one-in-438 million when he picked up a £160,873 EuroMillions prize this year to add to the £1 million sum he won in the Millionaire Raffle in September 2011. But the Bulgarian property developer, who lives in Ilford, Essex, joked that his windfall could have been even bigger. Scroll down for video . George Traykov beat odds of 1 in 438 million to win a second Euromillions fortune of £160,873.80 after winning £1 million in September 2011 . 'I missed the big jackpot by one number,' said the 45-year-old, who was just one digit short of claiming £12 million. Adrenaline junky George said the thrill of his second win did not compare to his real passion, skydiving. He said: 'I wasn't really that bothered. Nothing compares with skydiving.' It is a hobby many fathers may not encourage their 13-year-old daughter to do, but not so for Mr Traykov, who was once a member of the Bulgarian skydiving team. 'The first win enabled me to make a few changes in my life, most importantly sending my daughter Elaine to private school and maintaining her skydiving training sessions,' he said. Mr Traykov, who never picks his own numbers and always plays the lucky dip, was so laid back about his second big money win that he didn't even claim it until two months after the prize draw in November. He added that he could be sitting on even more money, saying he had a few more tickets he had not yet checked. Mr Traykov, 'happily divorced' in his own words, lives alone but was accompanied to a photo shoot to celebrate his win by a mysterious young brunette who kept hold of his 11-month-old pug puppy, called Muffin. He moved to Ilford in 1995 and does not plan to move away from the area. Making history: George Traykov (pictured with a cardboard cutout of himself) was given another big cheque after winning Euromillions a second time . 'I didn't know anyone at that time and I didn't have much money and the only place I could afford a home was Ilford,' he said. 'The place, the area, it is very safe, I have lovely neighbours.' For clean-living Mr Traykov, some of the trappings of a millionaire's lifestyle will take some getting used to. Thinking back to his first win, he said because he is teetotal he had difficulty mastering the typical technique of celebrating by spraying a bottle of champagne. 'I don't drink and I don't smoke so I had to waste a whole box of champagne until I got it right,' he said. This year, he did jet off to Cancun, Mexico, for a few weeks to ponder his fortune and said he wanted to renovate his own three bedroom 'normal' home this time. 'I've always worked very hard and never spent more than I have so money has never been a major problem for me,' he said. Mr Traykov bought his winning ticket at a Tesco store in Barking and could maybe one day make it a hat-trick of wins as he said he planned to carry on playing.","Geroge Traykov, 41, won the EuroMillions twice in just three years .

Mr Davies was also accused of making 'fake representation' by fraudulently claiming an insurance payment of £132,000 after her death. But the prosecution at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday offered no evidence against Mr Davies after new witnesses came forward. Mr and Mrs Davies and her husband were married in 2003 and went on a delayed honeymoon to India 14 months later. Her body was found in a ravine  near the town of Gaura. Collette Davies, 39, plunged 80ft to her death from a viewing platform over a steep gorge at an Indian beauty spot in February 2004 . Police in India investigated the death at the time and concluded that there were no suspicious circumstances. Her body was flown back to her home town of Bridgend, South Wales, where she was cremated after an inquest recorded an open verdict. But a fresh police inquiry was launched and Davies, of Milton Keynes, Bucks, was arrested and charged in November 2011.

The leader of Mid Devon Council said he would be recommending to the ruling cabinet that the policy was changed so that apostrophes would again be used. Councillor Peter Hare-Scott said he did not find it acceptable that incorrect grammar was being used on the council's street signs.

It means apostrophes such as the one seen on an avenue in Devon will also be placed on new signs . It followed a storm of protest last week when the policy to ban apostrophes was revealed. 'The convention not to use apostrophes when naming new streets has been in place since long before this administration took over,' councillor Hare-Scott  said. 'Personally I'm not happy about using English that's incorrect and don't find this acceptable. 'We are reviewing the situation and I shall be recommending to cabinet on March 28 that they amend the policy so that street names may indeed in future have apostrophes.'

It was billed as the tough cop-tough cop double team – veteran Miriam O’Callaghan and rising star Claire Byrne – that would wring the truth out of the protagonists in the big stories of the day. But the first controversy of RTÉ’s revamped current affairs flagship Prime Time pitched the two hosts against each other – and it was the younger woman who came off the winner. Both main anchor Miriam and newcomer Claire arrived for the first show wearing red. But in a breach of protocol and good manners, which observers say should have meant the younger woman being asked to change what she was wearing, sources have revealed that it was Miriam who was asked to change her outfit. Claire Byrne is given permission to stand out in red, while current affairs queen Miriam blends into the background in a blue blouse . RTÉ insiders have told the Irish Mail on Sunday that producer David Nally asked Miriam to change her clothes. ‘David came onto the studio floor and said, “Girls, you are both in red”. He turned to Miriam and asked her would she change her outfit. Miriam appeared not too happy and basically said, “Are you serious?” But she went ahead and changed.’ RTÉ have played down the incident, a spokeswoman saying that Miriam changed because she was wearing a red jacket and it was easier for her to swap outfits. ‘Claire and Miriam were dressed in similar colours, variations on red and pink. Claire had a red dress and Miriam was wearing a pinky-red jacket. We shot the promo [a short publicity clip promoting what would be on the programme later that evening] but it didn’t look right with the women in similar colours,’ she said. Miriam looking brighter in a scarlet red dress and black boots . ‘As Miriam was wearing a jacket, it was logical to ask her just to take it off. And she did so professionally and without any fuss at all. There was no issue.’ However, sources in RTÉ say Miriam was less than happy at being asked to change. The on-set exchange has become the talk of Donnybrook. Industry sources have also remarked that Miriam subsequently went on air in a blue blouse that made her almost invisible against the blue screen backdrop in the Prime Time studio. ‘Television rules dictate that you never wear the same colour as the background because the person basically disappears,’ said one. ‘If you look at the pictures of Miriam she is not clearly defined from the waist up as her blue blouse blends in with the blue screen behind her. In contrast, Claire’s red dress really stood out.’ It is understood that RTÉ presenters are no longer dressed from the station wardrobe but now wear their own clothes on air. This can give rise to co-presenters turning up in similar styles or colours, causing clashes – though the station’s conservative culture appears not to apply the same stricture to its hordes of ­sombre-suited male presenters. When it was announced last month that Miriam was to be joined by Claire and Pat Kenny in a merger of Prime Time and The Frontline, Miriam said she was delighted to welcome her new ­ co-anchors. ‘I’m really looking forward to working with both of them. I know Claire well and we’ve done different events together. But it’ll be great to have two women in the Prime Time studio,’ she said at the time of the announcement. Reaction to the new format has been broadly positive but RTÉ has yet to release figures. Mother-of-eight Miriam has presented Prime Time since 1996 and has made the current affairs show her own. However, Claire, 36, is seen as RTÉ’s star-in-waiting and has been given experience in a variety of roles and formats, including a short run hosting The Daily Show with Daithí Ó Sé. She also has her own show on RTÉ Radio 1 at lunchtime on Saturdays. Approached by the MoS, she declined to comment about the colour clash, while Miriam also said ‘no comment’ when contacted.","Veteran broadcaster Miriam blended into the background .

Caves owned the Beechcraft Premier I twin-jet that clipped one house before slamming into two more on Sunday afternoon. Caves had a pilot's license, but it was not immediately clear if he was flying the plane when it crashed. The plane leaked enough fuel to force the evacuation of hundreds of people from surrounding homes, but most residents were allowed to return Monday morning. Frank Sojka, 84, who lives in the first home that was struck, went back to his home Monday morning so he could retrieve some items. A total of eight homes remain under mandatory evacuation. 'I'm surprised people survived that,' he said as he sat in his car with his son, waiting for police to move the barricade on his street. Sojka said he was in the front bedroom of the home he's lived in for 55 years when he heard a loud, dull sound. 'I got up and went into the living room and I could see the sky through the ceiling and all kinds of debris in the far end of the living room,' he said.

South Bend Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Maggie Scroope said Monday that Jim Rogers was in serious condition and Christopher Evans was in fair condition. A woman who neighbors said lived in the middle house that was struck, Diana McKeown, was in fair condition, Scroope said. The plane began its journey in Tulsa, Okla. It is registered to 7700 Enterprises in Helena, Mont., which does business in Tulsa as DigiCut Systems and is owned by Caves. Spoo said he did not know the connection between Davis and Caves. Davis went 32-1-1 as the Sooners' starter from 1973 to 1975, starting every game of Barry Switzer's first three seasons as head coach. South Bend firefighters work at the scene, where the plane crashed on Sunday, near the South Bend Regional Airport, Indiana . Oklahoma tied Southern California in the second game of the 1973 season, and then ran off 28 straight victories with Davis under center. The Sooners went 11-0 in 1974. They won the national title again the following year after going 11-1. Davis had joined the about 3,600-member congregation a couple of decades ago, but his travels and work took him elsewhere, Scroope said. He noted that in the last few years, Davis had become a more active member of the church. 'As followers of Jesus, we have two commands: One is to love God; the other is to love people, and Steve fulfilled those commands with excellence,' he said. Mike Daigle, executive director of the St. Joseph County Airport Authority, said the plane attempted a landing at the South Bend airport about 4:15 p.m., then went back up and maneuvered south to try another landing, but eight minutes later, the airport learned the plane was no longer airborne.

While he insists Ryan 'didn't appear drunk,' Kalinoski admits he was 'severely intoxicated.' 'I could barely walk,' he told The . Daily. 'I couldn’t drive home so I passed out in my car. That’s the type . of environment it became.' 'He was drinking quick': His friend reveals that Dunn was buying shots of whiskey for the entire bar hours before his death . Kalinoski says his own friends and family were concerned when they learned of the fatal crash on Monday morning. He said: 'My phone started ringing. People thought that I was in the accident. They said, ""Are you OK? Are you OK?""' Chester County Coroner's Office have confirmed from autopsy that the cause of death for Dunn and his passenger Zachary Hartwell, 31, was 'blunt and thermal trauma due to a motor . vehicle accident and that the nature of the deaths was accidental.' The report states that the accident in . Dunn's Porsche 911 was so violent that it was impossible to determine . whether they died from the initial impact of the crash or the fireball. High spirits: The 34-year-old posted this picture of himself (left) and passenger Zachary Hartwell (right) drinking with another friend at Barnaby's . Their injuries were such that Dunn was identified by his tattoos and hair, while there was a considerable delay in confirming that the passenger was Hartwell, who was also drinking at the bar on Sunday night. A . toxicology report, which will reveal the role of alcohol in the crash, will take four to six weeks. Kalinoski says that before leaving the bar around 2am, Dunn was encouraging his fellow revellers to tune into his new TV show Proving Ground, and spoke of how proud he was of best friend and co-star Bam Margera. 'He was just so excited for the future,' Kalinoski says. 'He was talking about all of these good things that were . happening - and then it’s over.' Overcome: Dunn's best friend and Jackass co-star Bam Margera visited the crash site yesterday and paid tribute to his friend, saying that his death is 'not right' Dunn also discussed his former addiction to painkillers with Kalinoski, telling him he 'was in a bad way' the last time they saw each other in Baltimore in 2006. 'He said back then he was having some problems. He was addicted to Vicodin and Adderall,' Kalinoski says. Dunn's best friend Margera visited the crash site today and gave an emotional interview to local news station WPXI. A weeping, and clearly overcome Margera said: 'It was the worst phone call I ever got in my life waking up to that. I've never lost anybody that I cared about. It's my best friend. Wreckage: The charred remains of the Porsche 911 GT3 is towed away - a police chief told reporters this 'unbelievable' crash was the worst he'd ever seen . 'He (Dunn) was the happiest person ever, the smartest guy. He had so much talent, and he had so many things going for him. This is not right, not right.' Police say Dunn was travelling at around 130mph in a 55mph zone when his Porsche 911 flew off the road at around 2.30am on Monday morning in Pennsylvania. West Goshen Police Chief Michael Carroll, who was involved in the accident reconstruction, described it as the worst crash he had ever seen. 'He was buying for the whole bar': Kalinoski reveals Dunn was drinking 'picklebacks' - whiskey shots chased with pickle juice - at Barnaby's . Mr Carroll told RadarOnline that the Porsche - which can hit speeds of up to 190mph - was going at a very high speed when it collided with a  guardrail, before landing in the woods and catching fire. He told the website: 'I've never seen a car destroyed in an automobile accident the way this car was even before it caught on fire,' Carroll said. 'The automobile actually came apart. It was unbelievable and I've been on a lot of fatal accident scenes. This is by far the worse I've ever seen.' Do you have a story about a celebrity?

The Connecticut State Police investigation into Adam Lanza's killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School has revealed that he studied other mass killings from around the world intently . Adam Lanza planned his Sandy Hook massacre in meticulous detail on a chilling 7ft long spreadsheet that police believe was used to keep score of killings, it was revealed today. Connecticut State Police found the 4ft wide document in Lanza's harddrive that was so big it required a special printer after the December 14 attack that left 26 people dead. It contained Lanza’s obsessive research - in nine-point font - about mass murders of the past, and even attempted murders. Among the tragedies Lanza studied were the 2006 mass shooting . carried out by Charles Carl Robert IV in which he killed five . Amish school girls as well as the 2011 massacre of 77 people in Norway . by Anders Behring Breivik. Investigators revealed they have found . reams of articles about multiple shootings, leading them to speculate he . intended to outdo them all. Police have also discovered evidence that . Lanza became extremely efficient in his mastery of his AR-15 Bushmaster . assault rifle - leading them believe he had been planning his assault for a . long time. Officers outlined the findings at the International Association of Police Chiefs and Colonels mid-year meeting in New Orleans last week, a law enforcement veteran told the New York Daily News. According to the officer: 'We were told (Lanza) had around 500 . people on this sheet. Names and the number of people killed and the weapons that were used, . even the precise make and model of the weapons. 'It had to have taken . years. It sounded like a doctoral thesis, that was the quality of the . research. 'They don't believe this was just a spreadsheet. They believe it was a score sheet,' he continued. 'This was the work of a video gamer, and that it was his intent to put his own name at the very top of that list. 'They believe that he picked an elementary school because he felt it was a point of least resistance, where he could rack up the greatest number of kills. That's what (the Connecticut police) believe. 'They believe that (Lanza) believed that it was the way to pick up the easiest points. It's why he didn't want to be killed by law enforcement. 'In the code of a gamer, even a deranged gamer like this little bastard, if somebody else kills you, they get your points. They believe that's why he killed himself.'

Tragedy: A woman waits to hear about her sister following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in December . Lanza's killing . spree lasted less than five minutes and during that time he fired 152 . bullets into two classrooms in the Connecticut elementary school. Lanza also had hundreds more rounds of ammunition on him and in the car that he drove to the school in. Arriving at Sandy Hook Elementary . School at 9.35 a.m., Lanza, 20, shot through the glass windows at the . school entrance and immediately encountered Principal Dawn Hochsprung . and school psychologist Mary Scherlach, who had been alerted by the . gunfire. He shot them both to death on sight. Two teachers were also injured by ricocheting bullets from that initial burst of gunfire. One had been in the school's meeting room with Hochsprung and Scherlach and was wounded in the leg. The other was further down the hallway outside her classroom after rushing out on hearing the shots and was hit in the foot. Police investigating the home of Adam Lanza in Sandy Hook Connecticut have uncovered a dossier regarding every mass murder inside and outside of the United States that he had compiled . The . member of staff who had been shot in the leg managed to crawl and call . the police, which explains the rapid response time of law enforcement to . the school. Continuing . down the corridor it was then that Lanza apparently walked by the . classroom of Kaitlin Roig, who had closed her classroom door on hearing . the gunfire. The school had recently performed a . practice lockdown drill and the black construction paper that had been . put up on the door had been left there - leading Lanza to think the . classroom was empty. Roig and her class, sat in petrified silence while they heard Lanza continue past their door. Lanza . then walked into the classroom of substitute teacher Lauren Rousseau to . find her and the terrified children huddled together at the back of the . room trying to hide in a bathroom. The deranged shooter killed Rousseau and all but one of her class. The . little girl escaped by playing dead and emerged from the school with . her clothes covered in blood saying, 'Mommy, I'm okay, but all my . friends are dead.'

Kept under wraps for half a century for fear of creating controversy, the entire contents of the ‘Bureau of Military History 1913-1921’ have been digitised by Ireland's Military Archives. The bureau was set up by the then minister for defence, Oscar Traynor, in 1947 to capture first-hand recollections from virtually all the surviving figures from the formation of the Irish Volunteers in 1913 until The Truce in 1921. Many of those involved were growing old and the State was anxious to record their memories before it was too late. Witness statements were taken from members of organisations including the Irish Volunteers (subsequently the IRA), the Irish Republican Brotherhood, Cumann na mBan, Sinn Féin and the Irish Citizen Army. The project took a total of 10 years and was completed in 1957. Present arms: A group of armed volunteers drilling in Dublin's Kilmainham Gaol .

In July 1921, both sides agreed to a ceasefire. The Easter Rising in 1916 resulted from the Volunteers - who declared a republic - launching an insurrection with the aim to end British rule and found an Irish Republic. More than 400 people died during the rising, which was confined to Dublin. The response of the British was to execute the leaders of the insurrection and arrest thousands of activists, which gave support to the separatist Sinn Fein. Irish public opinion was shocked by some of the actions of British troops and by the time of the November 1918 election, alienation from British rule was widespread.

Jailed: Brian Fraser was cleared of shooting his former lover outside her country home but has been jailed for possessing a gun without a licence . A former master of foxhounds who was cleared of shooting his former lover outside her country home has been jailed for eight months for possessing a firearm without a licence. Brian Fraser, 63, was found not guilty last month of the attempted murder of Louise Leggatt, 55, and also of causing her grievous bodily harm with intent. Prosecutors had claimed he shot Mrs Leggatt as she went to tend her horses at Apple Pie Farm in Benenden, Kent, after she rejected his efforts to rekindle their romance following the end of their five-year relationship. Following a two-week trial, married Fraser, a former joint master of the Ashford Valley Hunt, was found not guilty of shooting his former girlfriend at around 9.30pm on March 15 last year. But at Maidstone Crown Court today, Fraser, of Shadoxhurst, near Ashford, was jailed after earlier pleading guilty to possessing a firearm without a licence. Judge Charles Byers said Fraser will serve up to half his jail term and the remainder on licence. He also imposed a restraining order banning him from contact 'directly or indirectly' with Mrs Leggatt or any member of her family. Jailing Fraser, the judge told him it was 'the most serious case of its type' and that the public expects the highest control of firearms and ammunition. Judge Byers said: 'The criminal law applies to everybody and the whole point of licensing those who possess firearms is so that the authorities know where those weapons are and that they are being kept responsibly.' The judge said that, had Fraser applied for a firearms licence, he may well have been granted one because of his background in farming. Brian Fraser, a former joint master of the Ashford Valley Hunt, kept a gun under a bale of hay and was given ammunition by friends so he didn't have to go to a gunsmith to purchase it . 'Instead, you kept that gun under a bale of hay in an open barn where it could have been discovered and used by anyone for any purpose. 'The offence is aggravated because, when it was discovered, it was found with 40 rounds of ammunition of the correct calibre for that gun. 'The ammunition was given to you by people rather than you having to go to a gunsmith to purchase it where you would have had to produce a licence to show you were entitled to possess it.' The judge added: 'It could have fallen into the hands of children and one can only imagine what could have happened if they chose to experiment with it.' Judge Byers said that Fraser, of previous good character, continued to lie to police about owning the gun until his DNA was discovered on it. Fraser initially told police he had not owned a shotgun for 20 years. Nanette Fraser, wife of Brian Fraser (left) and Louise Leggatt (right) outside Maidstone Crown Court . When officers disclosed that one was found on his land, he suggested he was being framed. Later, following the disclosure that his DNA had been found on it, he admitted he did own the gun, telling officers it had been handed down to him by his father. He said he 'panicked' in the initial police interviews because he had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Mrs Leggatt and because he did not have a firearms licence. But he 'categorically' denied being responsible for blasting Mrs Leggatt, from whom he said he had split amicably and still considered a friend. Mother-of-two Mrs Leggatt - who worked in a veterinary surgery - was shot as she went to do her routine evening checks on her horses in the picturesque Kent village. Hidden: The shotgun found by police was stored between bales of hay on Brian Fraser's farm . She told the court that her dog was barking and seemed unsettled, 'as if there was something there that he didn’t like', as she stepped outside from her patio door. As she shone a torch across the garden and shut the patio door, she was shot once, leaving her peppered with shotgun pellets in her bowel and pelvis. She screamed that she had been hit and managed to stumble back inside her rented home before crawling to her landline telephone to dial 999. Mrs Leggatt said: 'First of all, I heard the sound and then I had a horrendous pain in my leg and hip, and I realised what had happened.' Her experience of going on shoots and of her two sons’ involvement with clay pigeon shooting led her to believe she had been targeted with a shotgun. She added: 'I was absolutely terrified. I had never been so terrified in all my life. I was really, really scared that whoever had done it was going to come back in and I couldn’t get back to lock the door.' Scene: Prosecutors had claimed Brian Fraser shot Mrs Leggatt when she went to tend her horses at Apple Pie Farm in Benenden, Kent . A firearms unit was deployed before paramedics were allowed to reach Mrs Leggatt, who was taken to Pembury Hospital in Tunbridge Wells for surgery. She told how she met Fraser through hunting circles in the early 2000s. Mrs Leggatt, who finalised a divorce from her husband, Philip Gorringe, in 2007, allowed Fraser to move into her home in 2006. Over time their relationship hit difficulties, with disagreements about finances, the lack of time they spent together and Fraser’s long working hours, Mrs Leggatt told the jury. By 2011, they were sleeping in separate rooms. He moved out of her home in November of that year and later went back to his wife, Nanette. Following the sentence Detective Sergeant Rebecca Benson, of The Kent and Essex Serious crime Directorate, said: 'This case reflects an irresponsible approach to firearms ownership. 'Storing a working shotgun alongside ammunition in an open space where anyone could have got their hands on it is nothing short of reckless. 'I hate to think of what may have happened if the weapon had been found by children or someone intent on committing a crime. 'This sentence reflects the seriousness of the offence and will no doubt warn others of the need to licence their guns and store them in a responsible manner.'","Brian Fraser found not guilty of the attempted murder of Louise Leggatt .

Poachers have killed 86 elephants in one week in a single central African country in the worst mass slaughter of the animals this year, officials said yesterday. Armed gangs in Chad reportedly killed the elephants, including 33 pregnant females, before hacking out and stealing their tusks. Wildlife officials said the killings took place last week near Chad’s border with Cameroon. Shot en masse: Armed poachers slaughtered 86 elephants in a single week in Chad, a year after poachers slaughtered around 630 elephants in neighbouring Cameroon (pictured) Céline Sissler-Bienvenu, of the . International Fund for Animal Welfare, said the slaughter ‘is evidence . of the callous brutality demanded to feed the appetite of the ivory . trade’. She added: ‘Elephants in central Africa continue to be under siege from unscrupulous poachers.’ IFAW said it believed the killings . were not reported for several days amid a dispute between local people . and the government about the presence of wild elephants in the area. Last year's killing spree: Armed gangs rode on horseback from Chad and Sudan to Cameroon's Bouba Ndjida National Park before shooting the animals, around half of the huge park's population . High demand: Mass poaching incidents were particularly common during the region's dry season when heavily-armed groups of poachers used military-issue automatic and semi-automatic weapons to launch coordinated attacks on herds . The organisation’s Jason Bell said the incident showed some regions of Africa faced losing their entire elephant population. He added: ‘The poaching of elephants . for their ivory is an issue of global significance, and needs a global . response if we are to turn the killing fields of central Africa into . safe havens for elephants. Illegal trade: Selling and exporting ivory is banned in an attempt to protect elephants but remains in high demand especially in China and Japan . ‘This cannot happen in a vacuum. Ivory-consuming nations – notably China – have to make a concerted . effort to reduce the demand for  ivory in their own back yards. Otherwise, the battle to save elephants will be lost.’ Last week’s slaughter in Chad comes a year after poachers killed around 630 elephants in neighbouring Cameroon.

A sixteen-year-old high school star athlete was shot and killed on the weekend when he entered a house just two doors down from his own home in the middle of the night and was taken for an intruder. Details remain murky as to what Caleb Gordley was doing in the neighbour's house so late on Saturday night, and police have not yet released an official statement. Friends of the teen's are calling the fatal shooting a terrible accident and saying that after a night of drinking, he must have mistaken the house for his own seeing as they are almost identical from behind and he had only lived in the area for a year. Fallen: Caleb Gordley, 16, was shot and killed at around 2.30am on Sunday morning when he entered his neighbour's home two doors down from his own, seemingly by mistake, after a night of drinking with friends . 'Knowing Caleb, he wouldn't have bad intentions,' said one in an interview with WUSA9. 'He was a good kid.' Those who know Donald West Wilder II, the homeowner of the property where the incident took place, meanwhile spoke highly of the community-minded firefighter, adding further mystery to the alleged mix-up. According to sources at Park View High School where Gordley was a student, the victim had been out drinking with friends until late on Saturday night and had been dropped off at the quiet Sterling, Virginia cul-de-sac where he lived,  at around 2.30am. Close: Because of the proximity of the houses and the fact that they appear similar at night time, investigators think he may have accidentally gone into the wrong home at the time he was shot . Lookalikes: The star athlete lived in this Sterling, Virginia cul-de sac in the house on the right and may have thought his neighbour's home was his own according to friends . Tragic error? Donald West Wilder II, the owner of the house just two doors down (left) shot the teen thinking he was an intruder after calling 911 but details are still murky as police continue to investigate . For reasons unknown, however, the . popular basketball player and promising rapper went to Mr Wilder's house . and tried to enter instead of his own. Some reports suggest that he may have entered through a back window and set off a security alarm. Though the Loudon County Sheriff's office continues to investigate before confirming details, one law enforcement official told the Washington Post that Gordley had attempted to walk upstairs where the family were sleeping before he was shot. Hearing an intruder, Mr Wilder called 911 to report the break-in but by the time authorities reached the property, a large mansion-style two-storey home on the 45900 block of Pullman Court, Gordely was already dead. Mystery visit: An unidentified man tried to talk to someone at the house where the incident took place but after gesticulating wildly was shut out . Escape: After fleeing in his car, he backed up the street in reverse and ran into the house where Gordley lived with his family . Virginia law permits homeowners to use deadly force if they feel threatened inside their own homes. Neighbour . Joanna Roman, could not understand the tragedy. She described Mr Wilder . as 'a great neighbor, a helper, someone who spends spare time . volunteering to help others. He's an active member of our community. He's a good person.' Similarly, another Pullman Court resident, Khang Nguyen, called Mr Wilder a 'very nice gentleman, very quiet, too.' Star: Gordley was described by students and coaches as an excellent athlete, a popular boy and a gifted rapper who had good intentions . Meanwhile, students and friends of the slain teen have rallied to his defence, calling the shooting 'shocking'. 'He was on the basketball team, baseball... he brought happiness to the whole team,' said one friend.

Seance: Acorah 'channeled' various spirits in the episode, including a headless drummer boy and the ghost of someone killed in the Tower of London . Ofcom said that the programme's 'consistently dark and menacing' tone could have distressed younger viewers.

Ofcom ruled that the broadcast breached two rules of the programme code by being screened so early in the evening. The code is supposed to protect children from unsuitable material and to prevent demonstrations of the paranormal before the watershed. Sky argued that Most Haunted was established as an 'entertainment' programme and it did not have a sizeable audience among children. However, Ofcom said a 'significant number' of children could have been watching at that time. While adults may have realised the show was designed for entertainment, younger viewers may not have understood. Ofcom said the ruling only applied to that edition of the show, screened on October 17 last year, rather than the whole series because the content differed from programme to programme. It is not the first time Acorah's 'psychic' powers have caused controversy.

When B&B owner Robert Gray found a stuffed cat among the dust in his attic, he assumed it was some kind of bizarre antique. But after taking the pile of rags to a vet for an x-ray, it emerged the artefact is actually a 2,000-year-old Egyptian mummy. Images revealed the outline of a perfectly preserved ancient cat - complete with face, ears, spine and brain. Piece of history: The cat which Mr Gray found in his loft, left, was revealed to be a perfectly mummified pet after being x-rayed, right . Mr Gray, 56, of Portscatho, Cornwall, said the object had belonged to his late father Peter Gray who was an Egyptologist. Ancient: Mr Gray said the cat had belonged to his late father but he never realised it was a genuine artefact . But he had never realised the cat was a genuine piece of history and is worth several thousand pounds. Robert . said: 'My father acquired the cat in the 1970s as a token of thanks . from a museum. It's been in the loft languishing there for 50 years. 'It's . perfectly bandaged up and a very interesting item. Apparently interior . designers love this sort of thing, as ghoulish as it sounds. 'It could fetch a couple of thousands pounds but I will probably donate it to a museum.' Experts at the Royal Cornwall Museum have now verified the remarkable find. Ancient Egyptians mummified animals . as religious offerings or to ensure their beloved companions would . follow them into the afterlife. Mr Gray said his research has suggested that often the mummys would be a fake. He said: 'You went to the mummifiers . and said you wanted to send goodwill to the afterlife but some would . take your money and stuff a bunch of rags inside.' Cats were particularly popular subjects during the Ptolemaic period from 305 BC to 30BC because they were believed to represent the war goddess Bastet. Mr Gray's x-ray images show the neck . of his mummified moggy is still intact, suggesting it was a prized pet . rather than a sacrifice to the gods. Jane Marley, curator of archaeology and world culture at Royal Cornwall Museum, said: 'It was very exciting to see the X-ray. 'It's a lovely face and the wrapping is very good. It's been very well kept.' The chief embalmer wore the mask of Anubis - the God of the dead . Ancient Egyptians were firm believers in the afterlife when someone died. But they thought to get there, the body needed to be recognisable, so that the dead person could repossess it. The chief embalmer was a priest wearing the mask of Anubis - the jackal-headed God of the dead. First the brains would be pulled out of the person through the nose using a hook. Then all the internal organs would removed, including the lungs, stomach, intestines and liver and placed in jars. The heart would be replaced. The inside of the body would be rinsed with wine and spices before being covered with salt for 70 days. After 40 days it would be stuffed with linen to give it a more humane shape. At 70 days it would be wrapped in bandages and placed inside a brightly-painted coffin. Mainly wealthy people were mummified because poorer people could not afford it. Animals were also sometimes mummified as gestures to the Gods or so that they could accompany their owners in the afterlife.

Savers will continue to be hammered by the rising cost of living after it emerged the Government will not offer inflation-busting accounts for at least a year. Small print buried in the Budget revealed the Treasury will not relaunch National Savings and Investments index-linked certificates until April 2014 at the earliest. The popular tax-free deals are a lifeline for savers, especially the elderly who need to protect their fixed incomes from price rises. Savers will continue to be hammered by the rising cost of living after it emerged the Government will not offer inflation-busting accounts for at least a year . Some 900,000 thrifty households already have £25billion stored in these accounts, which pay interest matching inflation – currently 2.8 per cent – plus as much as 1.35 per cent on top. However, they have not been available to new customers since September 2011. The decision not to reintroduce them for another year means millions of savers will lose out. Currently, no ordinary bank or building society account’s interest rates can beat  the rate of inflation – meaning savers’ earnings will be outstripped by the rising cost  of living. Basic-rate tax-payers need a savings account paying 3.5 per cent to beat tax and inflation, while a higher-rate earner needs 4.67 per cent. However, analysis by the website Savingschampion.co.uk found that the average rate paid on an easy-access savings account is just 0.77 per cent. Only a handful of cash ISAs pay inflation-beating returns – but to benefit you need to be prepared to tie your money up for years, or have a huge lump sum to simply qualify. Anna Bowes, Savingschampion.co.uk’s director, said: ‘What’s happening is an absolute travesty for savers, and it’s only set to get worse. ‘Those who have done the right thing for the future by saving have been hammered hard – and now there is even less incentive for future generations to save.’ National Savings & Investments pulls in public money through a mix of savings deals, including index-linked certificates, and premium bonds. Small print buried in George Osborne's Budget revealed the Treasury will not relaunch National Savings and Investments index-linked certificates until April 2014 at the earliest . It is backed by the Treasury, so customers’ cash is guaranteed to be safe, even if savings exceed £100,000. However, the Government can raise funds more cheaply on the money markets, and so has little incentive to offer juicy index-linked deals. Attempts to kick-start the economy have also hurt savers. The Government’s £80billion Funding for Lending scheme has pumped cheap credit into banks, and so they too do not need to offer tempting rates to attract savers’ money. The low base rate has also hit savers, causing them to miss out on more than £100billion of interest since the Bank of England cut it to 0.5 per cent in March 2009. To make matters worse, changes to the way the Bank of England works could effectively guarantee that interest rates will stay low for years even if inflation stays high. Ros Altmann, a former Downing Street adviser on savings, warned: ‘Savers simply cannot beat inflation – and will clearly continue to lose out. ‘The inflation forecast has been revised upwards, while the Chancellor made it clear that he expects interest rates to stay very low for a long time.’ Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson . Income tax receipts are to soar by a third thanks to an army of workers dragged into the higher rate tax bracket. The amount raised through income tax will rise from £150.5billion this year to £198.9billion in 2017/18. Part of the increase is down to higher wages, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. But the vast increase in the number of workers forced to pay the higher rate of tax will also have an effect. More than five million are expected to be in the 40p tax bracket by the next election in 2015 – two million more than at the 2010 election. ‘The higher rate is no longer something faced only by the highly paid few,’ said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Mike Warburton, an accountant at Grant Thornton, said: ‘We’re getting to a point where well over 60 per cent of all the income tax receipts we receive are going to be from higher rate taxpayers. ‘Some of that is going to be from those at the very top, but some will also be from the huge numbers of people who are being dragged in to paying higher rate tax.’ The point at which workers start paying the 40p rate of tax has been kept artificially low by the Government as part of its policy of increasing the amount anyone can earn before paying tax to £10,000. The increase in the so-called personal allowance from £6,475 in 2010 to £10,000 in 2014 means 2.7million people will have been lifted out of paying income tax altogether. Workers will pay 20p in tax for every pound they earn above £10,000. But the IFS said the point at which the 40p band kicks in will be nearly £5,000 lower than it would have been in April 2014 if the Government had let the threshold rise with inflation. IFS analyst Stuart Adam said raising the threshold to where it would have been without government intervention would cost the Treasury £4.5billion in 2014/15 alone. Stephen Herring, senior tax partner at BDO, said the Chancellor deserved ‘full marks’ for raising the personal allowance to £10,000. He added: ‘A raspberry however for continued erosion of the basic rate tax band.’","National Savings and Investments index-linked certificates won't relaunch until 2014 .

Arrested: Abu Qatada has been arrested for allegedly breaching his bail conditions hours after his home was raided by counter-terror police . Abu Qatada was back in jail last night over fears the terror suspect was trying to communicate with associates, in breach of bail conditions. Qatada had his bail revoked by a senior judge in an emergency hearing, following a raid on his home. The judge said there was ‘strong evidence’ the Islamist cleric had breached strict bail terms by allowing mobile phones to be switched on at his North-West London house or letting electronic storage devices such as memory sticks be brought inside. Security sources said the investigation had implications for national security but declined to say if Qatada had been trying to contact known jihadists. Mr Justice Irwin ruled that Qatada be taken to high-security Belmarsh prison last night, ahead of a further hearing in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) next week. The decision will be seen as a boost to Home Secretary Theresa May – who broke the news during her speech to Tory party activists yesterday – ahead of another attempt in her long-running bid to send Qatada back to Jordan. Granted asylum in 1994, Qatada, 52, has since been described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe and is feared to have inspired a generation of terrorists. A secret MI5 dossier revealed last year by The Mail on Sunday claimed he had ordered ‘jihad’ against British and US citizens in the wake of 9/11. However, UK security services have never found enough evidence to charge him. Qatada has been found guilty of terrorism offences in his absence in Jordan. But SIAC ruled Jordan had not proved Qatada’s retrial would be free of evidence obtained by torture. Mrs May will challenge this decision in front of three Appeal Court judges on Monday. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Service Counter Terrorism unit said: 'There was material before SIAC suggesting he had breached his bail conditions. Police inspected the hate preacher's London home as the radical cleric was arrested for allegedly breaching his bail conditions . Officers had completed their searches of all four properties today and no hazardous materials had been found . Searches were carried out in connection with ongoing inquiries by the Counter Terrorism Command . As part of the 25 conditions, Qatada has a 22-hour home curfew.

'There will be a further hearing in . the matter on March 21, giving both sides the opportunity to submit more . evidence in the matter.' In . his ruling, Mr Justice Irwin said there was 'strong prima facie . evidence' that Qatada had breached a bail condition which prohibits him . from having mobile telephones switched on in his house while he is . present. It also bans . communications equipment such as digital media devices, re-writable CDs . and pen drives being brought into his house. Further consideration of bail will be brought before SIAC on Thursday March 21, he added. A . Home Office spokesman said: 'We are pleased the Special Immigration .

'We will vigorously argue our case at the next hearing on March 21.' Officers . completed searches at four properties today in connection with ongoing . inquiries by the Counter Terrorism Command but found no hazardous . materials, Scotland Yard said. No arrests have been made in connection with the police investigation. Qatada, who has been convicted of terror charges in Jordan, is due to appear at the Court of Appeal on Monday for Home Secretary Theresa May's bid to overturn a judge's decision to allow him to stay in the UK. The arrest came after Qatada’s house had been raided by specialist officers from the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command on Thursday. Officers carried bags of evidence from the 52-year-old’s £450,000 North London home after a 12-hour search. The Al Qaeda fanatic, once described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, was released from jail in February 2012 on condition of abiding by some of the strictest bail restrictions possible under English law.

Plans to redefine marriage in Scotland could mean that Jedi Knights could perform ceremonies, a church has claimed. The Free Church of Scotland has described plans by the Scottish Government to create a third category of marriage as 'completely nonsensical' ahead of a consultation on the proposals later this week. Reiterating its opposition to gay marriage, the Free Church said today that the proposals to establish 'belief' ceremonies alongside religious and civil ones could raise the prospect of Star Wars Jedi officiating marriage. May the force be with you: Star Wars fanatics in San Francisco are pictured learning Jedi moves at a special class. The Scottish Free Church has claimed that new government marriage proposals could see Jedi Knights performing marriage ceremonies . But the government defended its plans saying that the reputation of Scottish marriage would be protected and that the move would help groups such as humanists who are classed as a religious entity. A spokesman for the Free Church said: 'The proposal to create a third category of belief marriage ceremony alongside the current religious and civil ones is an indication of the increasing confusion that we can expect in the coming months and years. 'Humanists are already able to perform marriages under the religious category and we see no reason why this should not continue. 'Instead we are faced with the Scottish Government seeking to create a new category for something which already happens under the current system, which is completely nonsensical. 'We would also question whether this category only includes humanists or will it allow for any belief? 'Could the Jedi Knights or members of the Flat Earth Society be registered as belief celebrants? Devout fans: Some 14,000 people cited their religion as Jedi in the 2011 census, taking their inspiration from the Star Wars films, including Episode II Attack of the Clones (pictured) 'We believe that once the legislation is passed, the issues and complications will not go away.' The Scottish Government said however, that it would protect marriage by ensuring that a religious or belief body would have to meet a number of tests before a ceremony can take place. A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'Our current consultation covers not only the introduction of same-sex marriage but also the detail of important protections in relation to religious bodies and celebrants, freedom of speech and education. 'As part of the consultation, we have outlined the reason for suggesting a third type of ceremony. 'At the moment, marriage ceremonies by bodies such as humanists have been classed as religious, even though the beliefs are non-religious. 'It also makes clear that we are determined to ensure the continued reputation of Scottish marriage ceremonies. We are proposing the introduction of tests which a religious or belief body would have to meet before they could be authorised to solemnise marriage.' The Free Church of Scotland is a Presbyterian and Reformed denomination. It currently has over 100 congregations in Scotland, as well as two in London, five in North America, and sister churches founded by mission work in India, Peru and South Africa. In the 2011 Census, around 14,000 Scots named their religion as Jedi, inspired by characters from the fictional Star Wars films. Jedi values have often found themselves adopted as modern philospohical path or religion, with movements such as the controversial Jediism spawned. A knights school in San Francisco California also offers classes in Jedi skills.","The church described proposals as 'completely nonsensical'

Controversial: Coronation Street's Bill Roache suggested in an interview that sexual abuse victims are being punished for their 'previous lives' Bill Roache triggered fury yesterday after saying child sex abuse victims were being punished for past sins. The Coronation Street star was forced to issue an apology for remarks which also claimed people should be ‘totally forgiving’ of paedophiles. In an interview, the 80-year-old, who has played Ken Barlow for five decades, called for anonymity for those accused of child sex offences until they had been convicted of any charges. He said celebrities can sometimes be caught in a trap by ‘sexually active groupies’ who, he appeared to suggest, are younger than they look. Roache, whose soap colleague Michael La Vell is currently awaiting trial over hotly contested child sex allegations, made his comments in an interview with TV New Zealand’s One News. Discussing the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal, Roache – a member of the spiritual Pure Love Movement – said: ‘If you accept that you are pure love, and if you know that you are pure love and therefore live that pure love, these things won’t happen to you.’ His interviewer commented: ‘To some people that sounds perhaps like you’re saying victims bring things on themselves – is that what you’re saying?’ Roache replied: ‘No, not quite, and yet yes I am, because everything that happens to us has been a result of what we have been in previous lives or whatever.’ He went on to call for anonymity for all those accused of child sex offences because of the stigma they faced even if innocent. He said: ‘Paedophiles should be sought out, rooted out and dealt with. ‘But there’s a fringe of people who, particularly pop singers, they have these groupies, these girls, who come, they’re sexually active, sexually mature, they don’t ask for their birth certificate, they don’t know what age they may be. Scroll down for video . Row: Reporter Garth Bray (right) asked the actor if he was saying 'victims bring things on themselves' and he replied 'No, not quite, but then yes I am' ‘But they’re certainly not grooming them and exploiting them, but they can be caught in this trap. ‘These people are instantly . stigmatised, some will be innocent, some will not, but until such time . as it’s proven there should be anonymity for both.’ He added: ‘If someone has done . something wrong, the law will take its course. But even so, all of them, . whether they are proven guilty or not, we should not be judgmental . about anybody, ever. ‘We shouldn’t go around condemning, unforgiving. We should all be totally forgiving about everything.’ His comments drew stinging criticism . from the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, which . called them an insult to abuse victims. Outspoken: Coronation Street's Bill Roache is facing a storm of controversy today after claiming that sex abuse victims bring it on themselves during an astonishing TV interview . Dr Jon Bird, from Napac, condemned . Roache’s ‘hippy-dippy’ spiritualist beliefs, saying child sex abuse left . people with horrific physical and mental scars. The NSPCC described the actor’s . comments as ‘bizarre’ and ‘not helpful’. Jon Brown, head of the NSPCC’s . sexual abuse programme, said: ‘We should be concentrating on helping the . thousands of children sexually abused every year who need therapy to . re-build their lives.’ Roache, who has been in New Zealand . promoting a Coronation Street stage show, later said he was ‘very sorry’ for any offence that has been caused as a result of his comments. ‘I would never say that victims of . sexual offences are in any way responsible for the abuse they have . suffered and I offer my deepest apologies if anything I have said has . been misunderstood in this way,’ he added. But in an interview with Sky News, . Roache said: ‘Life is what you make it. 'We do come in to life to learn . from certain experiences and broadly some of the major experiences we . have asked to go through, this is my understanding of life.’ The actor is not the first celebrity to get into hot water over controversial remarks about the effects of alleged ‘past sins’. In 1999, England football manager . Glenn Hoddle lost his job after suggesting disabled people were being . made to pay for previous misdemeanours. By Francesca Infante . Despite an illustrious career in television, Bill Roache has never been far from controversy. He made memorable headlines when he claimed to have slept with 1,000 women during his youth, admitting he regularly cheated on his first wife Anna Cropper. He also admitted to having a fling with Coronation Street co-star Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie Tanner, but later dismissed it as a ‘one off’. The star has made many outlandish statements during interviews, many based on his spiritual beliefs with the Pure Love Movement. On life philosophy he has said: ‘We are love, love solves everything, love is everything.’ Break up: The Coronation Street star split up with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, his 44-year-old partner of three years, to focus on the soap and his spiritual side rather than sex and relationships . His comments on being ‘forgiving’ towards paedophiles chime with remarks he has made about Hitler. He said: ‘No one is naturally bad, everyone is inherently a very beautiful, spiritual being. Everybody, Hitler included.’ On Anders Breivik, he said: ‘If you want to get rid of that evil you don’t let him rot in prison. If we throw real love at him eventually he will realise what he did wasn’t right.’ At the end of the nineties Roache ended up bankrupt following a libel battle with The Sun for calling him  ‘boring Ken Barlow’. He won the case but was judged to have wasted court time with the law suit and was awarded only £50,000, the amount the paper had offered him to settle out of court. He was left with huge legal bills which he compounded with the decision to sue his lawyers over the case, landing him in up to £600,000 of debt. Around the same time he also launched a board game called Libel, which he invented himself and which proved a spectacular failure. Earlier this year it was revealed he ended his two-year relationship with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, 44, so he could explore a ‘mystic message of love’ linked to his membership of Pure Love. In what he calls his ‘search for truth’ he has dabbled in druidism, donned white robes at Stonehenge, and experimented with Buddhism. Last week he took part in a psychic reading in the hopes of communicating with his two pet dogs live on TV. Appearing on This Morning he said he believed all people are telepathic and telepathy will be the means of communication in the future.

A bronze and enamel cockerel placed in the grave of a two year old Roman girl as a message to the Gods has gone on display after a 'stunning' restoration. Archaeologists made the discovery in Cirencester two years ago, and say it is only of only eight known in the Roman Empire. They believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave by loving parents hoping it would ease their daughter's transition into the 'next world'. The magnificent cockerel was found in child's grave in Roman Cirencester - and has been painstakingly restored. It goes on show in the historic town today . The cockerel had special significance to the Romans and there is a known connection to the god Mercury. Statues of this god, including one in the Corinium Museum, commonly show a cockerel at the base. The association probably stems from Mercury’s role as the messenger to the gods and that of the cockerel as ‘announcer’ of the new dawn. Mercury was also the ‘herdsman for the dead’, guiding newly deceased souls on their passage to the afterlife. It is therefore possible that the cockerel was an offering by a devotee of Mercury and expresses a parent’s particular concern to ensure safe transit of a loved one into the after world. The child was buried wearing hobnailed shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel and the remarkable enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel. The cockerel stands 125mm high and the breast, wings, eyes and ‘comb’ are inlaid with enamel, which now appears blue and green. There is a separately moulded tail plate, also enamelled, with ‘openwork’ decoration. The beak is shown open, in the act of crowing. Today the restored bird went on show in the Cotswold town where it was found. Its finders, the Cotswold Archaeology group, say it 'looks absolutely fantastic.' The 12.5cm bronze figure is thought to have been placed in the child's grave as a message to the gods. It is believed that the Romans gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with Mercury. Experts say it was Mercury, a messenger to the gods, that was also responsible for conducting newly-deceased souls to the afterlife. The conservation work took four months to be painstakingly carried out by experts. Archaeologist Neil Holbrook, from Cotswold Archaeology, said the work had 'exceeded expectations', particularly for highlighting its fine enamel detail. 'It reinforces what a fantastic article this is and how highly prized and expensive it must have been,' he said. 'This must have cost, in current money, thousands of pounds to buy and countless hours to make, and so to actually put this into the grave of a two or three-year-old child is not something that you would do lightly. 'It really shows that this was a very wealthy, important family, and signifies the love that the parents had for the dead child.' The cockerel was found during excavation work at the former Bridges Garage site on Tetbury Road in Cirencester - or Corinium as it was known when it was the second largest town in Roman Britain.

A burial site was unearthed at the . site including more than 40 burials and four cremations; something . experts said was the largest archaeological find in the town since the . 1970s. This . particular figurine is one of only four ever found in Britain, with a . total of eight known from the whole of the Roman Empire. Mr Holbrook added: 'Without a doubt this is the best Roman cockerel ever found in Britain. 'This is the best find that I have seen come out of Cirencester in 30 to 40 years and is of national significance.' The . object is believed to have been made in northern Britain, with evidence . pointing to a workshop in Castleford, West Yorkshire, which made enamel . artefacts. Talks are under way to find a permanent display site for the cockerel, possibly at the Corinium Museum in Cirencester. Only eight similar cockerel figurines are known from the Roman world, including four from Britain. The similarities in construction and decoration suggest that they were made at roughly the same time and could have come from the same workshop. Our example is the only one from Britain to have come from a grave and the only one from any location to have survived with a tail. The two which are closest in form are from Cologne in Germany and Buchten in the Netherlands. In these examples the enamelling survives in the original colours of yellow, blue and red and it is probable that the Cirencester example was originally just as brightly coloured. Britain produced some of the finest enamelled objects in the Roman Empire and these were traded as far afield as Germany, France, Spain and Italy. The four enamelled cockerels from the continent all come from Germany and the Low Countries.","Enamelled bird was was found in a child's grave in Cirencester two years ago - and is is only of only eight known in the Roman Empire.

"PUBLISHED: . 12:09 EST, 18 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:53 EST, 18 March 2013 . Researchers have unveiled the nearest thing yet to a real-life transformer - a human sized robot that can walk, climb walls and even turn into a tank to move across tough terrain. The Carnegie Mellon University Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform, or . CHIMP, is designed to primarily move like a tank using tracks to cover . tough terrain. However, when it needs to, it can simply stand up - and even use . built in 'claws' to climbs ladders, scale buildings and even hold a . car's steering wheel. The latest entrant to DARPA's $2m Robotics Challenge is a four-limbed robot with near-human strength and the dexterity to climb ladders or use tools . Like a chimpanzee, each extremity is equipped with a manipulator that enables it to grasp objects . Its developer say it can: . Move across tough terrain like a tank . Stand up to access higher objects . Climb walls using 'claws' Climbs ladders . Use claws to operate power tools . Open valves and control steering wheels . Its normal mode of locomotion will be much like that of a tank, with the tracks of all four limbs on the ground, the team says. This configuration would offer a particular advantage when moving over debris and rough terrain. But CHIMP also can move on the treads . of just two limbs when needed, such as when it must use one or more . limbs to open a valve, or to operate power tools. CHIMP will be able to perform complex, physically challenging tasks through supervised autonomy. A remote, human operator will make . high-level commands controlling the robot’s path and actions, while the . robot’s on-board intelligence prevents collisions, maintains stability . and otherwise keeps the robot from harm. The robot also will be pre-programmed . to execute tasks such as grasping a tool, stepping on a ladder rung or . turning a steering wheel without step-by-step direction from the human . controller, circumventing the lag between command and execution. 'Humans provide high-level control, . while the robot provides low-level reflexes and self-protective . behaviors,' said Tony Stentz, NREC director and Tartan Rescue Team . leader. 'This enables CHIMP to be highly capable without the complexity associated with a fully autonomous robot. The CMU Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform (CHIMP) from Carnegie Mellon University uses mounted tracks on each triple-jointed limb to move like a tank over roads . As well as tracks, the Chimp robot has triple-fingered manipulators to climb up ladders, remove debris, or even turn a steering wheel . 'This type of robot has tremendous potential,' he said. The robot will compete in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, in which robots will have human-like capabilities to respond to calamities such as the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster. Climbing ladders and driving vehicles are among the obstacles robots will face in environments engineered for people. The NREC entry, Tartan Rescue Team, is one of seven selected by DARPA for DRC Track A, in which each team will develop its own hardware and software. CHIMP is designed with static stability; it won’t fall down even if it experiences a computer glitch or power failure. 'When we walk or stand, our brains are actively controlling our balance all of the time,' Stentz said. 'This dynamic balance makes people nimble and enables them to run.' When necessary, however, the operator can control CHIMP’s individual joints, enabling it to adapt its motion to particular circumstances or extricate itself from tight spots. 'In a pinch, it can do anything,' Stentz said. The robot can move like a tank over roads and rough ground, but can rise up onto two tracks to use the triple-fingered manipulators to climb up ladders, remove debris, or even turn a steering wheel .","Carnegie Mellon University Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform, or .

The Obama administration is 'considering' building a Death Star after an online petition reached the 25,000 signatures it needed to be accepted by the White House. The online petition, which calls for the U.S. government to 'secure resources and funding, and begin construction of a Death Star by 2016' now has more than 27,000 signatures. First seen in the sci-fi classic Star Wars, the Death Star is a spherical, moon-sized space station that is capable of destroying entire planets with a single energy beam blast. The Galactic Empire's ultimate weapon: Now the White House is 'considering' building its own Death Star after an online petition calling for its construction passed 25,000 signatures within 30 days . Commanded by Grand Moff Tarkin, played in Star Wars by Peter Cushing, it is the Galactic Empire's ultimate weapon, and is used to obliterate Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. The petition on the White House's We The People website for the U.S. to build its own Death Star was started by a Colorado man identified only as John D. A statement reads: 'By focusing our defense resources into a space-superiority platform and weapon system such as a Death Star, the government can spur job creation in the fields of construction, engineering, space exploration, and more, and strengthen our national defense.' The We The People website claims that any petition which attracts 25,000 signatures within 30 days will be guaranteed as assessment by White House staff. 'If a petition gets enough support, White House staff will review it, ensure it’s sent to the appropriate policy experts, and issue an official response,' it says.

Students from  Lehigh University of Pennsylvania in February calculated that, in today's economy, it would cost  $852quadrillion to build a 140m diameter Death Star. At current production rates, it would take 833,315 years to mine enough steel to begin work on such a weapon, they estimated. The Galactic Empire's Death Star was eventually destroyed by Luke Skywalker leading a squadron of fighter pilots from the Rebel Alliance.","Online petition signed by 27,000 calls on U.S. to begin building by 2016 .

President Obama says Iran is ‘over a year or so’ away from developing nuclear weapons and that he will use ‘all options’ to stop them. In the lead-up to his first ever presidential visit to the country next week, Obama sat for an interview with Israeli television. ‘Right now, we think it would take over a year or so for Iran to actually develop a nuclear weapon, but obviously we don't want to cut it too close,’ he told Israel’s Channel 2 news March 14, according to ABC News. Prepping: Ahead of his visit to the country, Obama sat down with the Israel's Channel 2 news and discussed the hot topic of nukes in Iran . Israel’s concerns over Iran’s nuclear program are expected to be the major focus of Obama’s trip to the country. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been vocal about his belief that Iran is developing nuclear technology at a clip much faster than what Obama describes and the differing timelines are expected to be a sticking point in talks between the two leaders. In addition to outlining what US intelligence believes they know about the Iranian nuclear program, Obama made clear that his first course of action to stop Iran from building the bomb is through diplomacy. The president called diplomacy ‘a more lasting solution’ and said this message is the same one he’s given to Prime Minister Netanyahu in the past. Disagreement: While Obama said Iran could be capable of building a nuke in 'a year or so,' Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu believes they're much closer . All options: While Obama maintains his desire for diplomacy, last week Joe Biden said the president will use military action if forced . However, Obama also hinted that he’s prepared to take US intervention in Iran a step further than diplomacy. ‘I continue to keep all options on the table,’ he said. Those options may include the military, if recent words from Vice President Joe Biden are any indication. He said as much earlier in March while speaking to the powerful pro-Israel lobby American Israeli Public Affairs Committee. No plans: Iran maintains its nuclear program is only for producing electricity at power plants like this one and has no plans for a nuclear weapons program . ‘If God forbid the need to act occurs,’ Biden said March 4, ‘it is critically important for the whole world to know that we did everything in our power, we did everything that reasonably could have been expected to avoid any confrontation.’ Meanwhile, President Obama maintained that non-military tactics at limiting Iran’s nuclear program are ‘having a significant effect.’ The president also made clear in the interview, reports the New York Times, that Iran’s time to comply with international demands is finite. ‘There is a window,’ he said, ‘not an infinite period of time, but a window of time where we can resolve this diplomatically.’","Ahead of his visit to the region, the president assured Israel in a television interview he will use 'all options' to stop Iran .

Tens of thousands of U.S. college students are flocking to the Mexican city of Cancun this years rather than travel to other popular tourist hotspots, which have been deemed too dangerous. City officials said Friday that they expected thousands more visitors than the 25,000 who came to the Caribbean coast resort last year. They said at least part of that boost in visitors could be attributed to people avoiding Pacific Coast resorts such as Acapulco, which have been hit by high-profile incidents of criminal violence in recent years. Soak up the sun: Mexican Navy sailors patrol the beach as revelers relax during spring break last year . Revelry: Cancun is regularly one of the top picks for American Spring-Breakers and is said to be the most popular choice of destination for students this year . Cancun tourism director Maximo Garcia Rocha said some major tourist agencies were expecting as many as 43,000 spring breakers, but the major influx was only beginning Friday. The Cancun Hotel Association said occupancy was at 90 per cent citywide. With vacationers arriving en masse in Cancun, local officials have stepped up patrols of marines, soldiers and special tourist police in zones packed with hotels and bars. Brad Madani, a 24-year-old from Toronto, said he had come to Cancun for the second time and was drawn by the beaches, discos and bikini contests. While many Canadians think Mexico is dangerous, Madani said, he felt safe in Cancun, particularly with the heavy presence of marines. Speaking in halting Spanish, he added, ‘Hay muchas chiquitas bonita,’ or ""There are many pretty girls."" Garcia said city authorities were distributing flyers at the 10 main spring break hotels giving numbers for the U.S. Consulate and advising spring breakers not to drink or urinate in the streets, use drugs, start disturbances or destroy property. While some risk management companies have attempted to change the image of Mexico as a crime-ravaged country, it appears that the travelers’ fears are not unfounded. On patrol: Mexican navy marines were out yesterday to ensure there was no trouble among Spring Breakers in the resort . Mexico is on the U.S. State Department ‘Current Travel Warnings’ list. Diamante, the popular tourist area where six Spanish women were tied up with their bikinis, raped and robbed last month, ‘has been less affected by violence,’ according to the State Department's website. The Obama administration issued a travel warning in November 2012, noting that resort areas and tourist destinations generally do not see the levels of violence and crime reported in other areas of Mexico, but ‘crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country and can occur anywhere,’ NBC reported. The website lists general and state-specific security information. Due to the number of kidnappings and disappearances in Mexico, it advises travelers to ‘lower your profile and avoid displaying any evidence of wealth that might draw attention.’ For the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located, avoiding non-essential travel in certain areas, and best times of day and routes to travel are addressed. Tourists in certain cities, including Acapulco ‘should exercise caution and stay with in tourist areas.’ This year, Cancun was found to be the number one destination for students looking to enjoy the typically wild week-long holiday, which got to an early start in February.

His father, also called Paul, told the inquest: 'I kept the three drugs in a kitchen cupboard - Paul had never expressed any interest in taking the medication. 'He was a wonderful human being and always saw the good side in people. The inquest heard that Paul's death was the result of his own actions, even though it was unintentional . 'The only thing he ever wanted was to be loved - he brightened up everyone's life.' Paul was found dead at his home in Wellington, Hereford, in November last year. The Hereford inquest heard younger Paul suffered from the medical condition dyspraxia which caused him to have a lack of awareness of danger and a 'sense of invincibility'. Detective Sgt Tim Powell told the inquest that Paul's death was the result of his own actions, even though it was unintentional. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. Dyspraxia is a life-long common disorder that affects movement, co-ordination and social skills. It is also known as developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD). Dyspraxia affects basic motor skills - such as walking - and fine motor skills -such as writing - in children and adults, the NHS says. Adults with the condition can suffer social and emotional difficulties, as well as problems with time management and organisation. The condition is believed to affect around five to six per cent of people in the UK. Men are more disposed to suffer from it, and it tends to run in families.","Student was found unconscious no a beanbag in his Hereford home .

Drones have become the latest must-have tools for security forces across the world, providing a watchful eye in the sky. But a team of engineers could extend the vehicles' watching brief - developing a claw-like leg that would allow drones to snatch objects while in flight. Engineers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia based their design on the bald eagle, replicating the bird's ability to clutch fish from water while in flight. Snatch: Engineers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia have developed a grabbing arm that can be attached to a drone . Inspiration: The team based their design on the bald eagle's ability to snatch fish from water mid-flight . Grabbed: An arm attached to the drone is able to lag behind the vehicle's centre-point, like an eagle's legs . The gripping device, comprising three talon-like arms, has been tested on a tiny unmanned aerial vehicle. Situated on the end of a attached leg, the claw can drag slightly behind the drone's centre of mass - much like an eagle's legs as it flies - allowing the path of flight to continue uninterrupted. The scientists noticed that the slight delay and detachment from the eagle's body meant it had an extra split-second to effectively grab objects. At another Philadelphia university software is being developed that hopes to stabilise drones with arms while in flight.

The team at Drexel University hope the software will allow drones to pick up objects without seriously affecting flight, by redistributing the weight. The software could be used to allow drones to pick up medication, use hand tools and even prune trees. Developer Christopher Korpela told the New Scientist: 'A UAV with arms could perform the same tasks as a ground robot, but with a three-dimensional workspace.

A petition on the White House website accuses the television presenter of undermining the 'rights of Americans.' Any petition posted on the site that attracts more than 25,000 signatures guarantees a response from the U.S. government. Last week Mr Morgan repeatedly attacked pro-gun guests on his nightly CNN shows following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20 children and six staff died. Scroll down for video . Divisive: A petition has been launched to deport Piers Morgan after he has taken a strict stance on gun laws . He called Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners for America, an 'idiot,' 'dangerous' and an 'unbelievably stupid man' after he argued . that more guns would cut crime. In another debate on gun controls, an exasperated Mr Morgan shouted down . economist John Lott, author of More Guns, Less Crime and accused him of 'lying' over gun crime trends in foreign countries including Britain. Gun rights advocates, who have been forced on the back foot by public . outrage over the Connecticut school killings, were furious over the . attacks - particularly as they came from a foreigner. The petition on the White House website reads: 'British citizen and CNN . television host Piers Morgan is engaged in a hostile attack against the . U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment [the right to keep and . bear arms]. Speaking out: The petition had already garnered more than 65,000 signatures by Tuesday .

White House website and the administration has to respond if it collects . at least 25,000 signatures within 30 days. Morgan has made it clear in TV debates that he was not attacking the . Second Amendment, which gun advocates insist protects a citizen’s right . to bear arms. But the American establishment is usually terrified of doing anything . that could be deemed anti-constitutional and even Morgan’s on-air CNN . colleagues looked taken aback by the force of his anti-gun outbursts. Morgan, who also writes a column in the Mail on Sunday's Live magazine, has refused to  back down. Hitting back: Morgan has responded to the growing petition with a series of tweets . Outspoken: Morgan called gun advocate Larry Pratt 'an unbelievably stupid man' on his show last week . On Twitter, the former Daily Mirror editor insisted that 'wanting . America to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines isn't ""anti-consitutional"" – it’s called ""common sense.""' He also joked that, if deported, he was thinking of anchoring his CNN show from Jamaica. CNN has said it has no immediate comment on the petition but media . pundits believe the publicity won't damage a network which is struggling . to win audiences. Prior to the row, there had been speculation that Morgan might lose his prime-time slot. Independent publicist Howard Bragman said that the controversy was . likely to get Morgan noticed and may translate into higher ratings. 'A lot of it comes from his being British, he's seen the differences . between the U.S. and UK, he's passionate and authentic in taking this . issue on, and it's probably only going to help him attract more people . to his show,' Mr Bragman said.

Shadia Alvarez, principal of the Collegiate Institute for Math and Science in the Bronx, stuck up a poster warning the pupils that unless all 140 students graduated, the senior prom would be cancelled. Principal Shadia Alvarez: Threatened to call-off the high school senior prom unless students worked hard and grades improve . Jose Abreu, a senior at the school told Fox News: 'It was a scare tactic basically for seniors to get their butts in gear.' Scroll down for video . Some kids at the school considered the possibility that Principal Alvarez might be faking it, but they didn't want to take their chances. Grades have apparently improved since the poster went up and now a new notice has gone up stating the prom is back on. When the Department of Education inquired about the unorthodox approach, Ms Alvarez denied there was any ultimatum. She said the school had high expectations and that the prom would only be cancelled if the students didn't at least try and pass. Administrators only made the announcement after they noticed grades had begun to slip. Collegiate Institute for Math and Science in Bronx, New York: The school is already one of the highest performing in the area but this year they're aiming for a 100% graduation rate . Student Joseu Abreu: The principal said cancelling prom was a scare tactic but it seems to have worked and everyone's now working harder . According to the New York Post, the school is on track to have a 90 percent graduation rate, higher than the city average of 66 percent. Many seniors at the school believe the principal did the right thing in giving them a wake-up call to buckle down as graduation nears. Prom night: This American rite of passage is something all seniors look forward to. No wonder the threat of cancellation made them work harder . The prom: One of the most important rituals of American youth . 'We the seniors knew we could be doing better than we were doing,' said Lala-Marie Perez. Now the students can look forward to wearing their tuxes and ballgowns along with their diplomas.","Students were told that prom wouldn't happen if pupils flunked their tests .

Fawlty Towers was hardly the best advert for the hotels of Torquay, but the Devon resort does have some of the best places to stay, says a survey. Torquay – the setting for Basil Fawlty’s chaotic hotel in the classic TV comedy – has come fifth in a UK league table for best service in hotels. It scored 8.21 points out of 10 to put it only a little behind the 8.46 achieved by Sheffield at the top of the list compiled from thousands of reviews by the hotel.info company. Not so bad: Fawlty Towers depicted hotels in Torquay as shambolic but hotels in the town came fifth for offering the best service in a table compiled by hotel.info . Second, on 8.39, was Norwich, with Leeds third, on 8.29, and York fourth, with 8.24. London trailed in at joint-22nd position, with 7.36 points. Compared with European hotels, the UK fared poorly, failing to make it into the top 20. This list was headed by Finland and Germany, both with 8.36 points. Austria was third with 8.35, while Hungary came fourth after scoring 8.31. The UK's neighbour Ireland was in 11th place with 8.12 points but the UK, with only 7.56 points, was below the 20th-placed nation, the Netherlands, on 7.82 points. Coastal: Torquay finished closely behind Sheffield in first place, Norwich in second and Leeds third . A hotel.info spokesman said: 'From rats in the restaurant to cream being poured over a guest’s head, Fawlty Towers gave Torquay a less-than-positive image, as far as hotel stays go. 'However, nearly 40 years have passed since then and our latest service quality survey has revealed that the British seaside favourite actually makes it into fifth position for service levels nationally.'

Low-cost airlines, estate agents and gyms are among businesses that face being taken to court over the fairness of hidden charges under proposals put forward by the bodies which recommend law reform. British courts should be empowered to scrutinise the fairness of costs tucked away in small print, the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission said. Under current laws, courts have the power to assess the fairness of a contract but are unable to look at the price. Hidden charges: Law reforms could mean future challenges to unfair extra costs in contracts to support customers against nasty surprises . The Commissions recommend that courts should not interfere with prices which are 'transparent and prominent' - but when charges are hidden in small print, they should be given the power to assess them for fairness. David Hertzell, the Law Commissioner leading on the project for England and Wales, said: 'The current law is baffling - so much so that consumers and regulators are reluctant to challenge unfair charges. 'Both traders and consumers need clearer law. If a price is transparent and prominent, the courts should not interfere - but other charges need to be fair.' He added: 'Our approach gives traders control over what charges are exempt from review - provided they put them upfront.' The Commissions said that the rise of price-comparison websites has piled pressure on traders to advertise low headline prices, while earning profits through other charges. Angry customers: Budget airline Ryanair is well-known for hitting consumers with charges outside the headline price, such as last minute baggage penalities . They said small print is not 'just about font size' - it also includes poor layout, densely phrased paragraphs and legal jargon. Dublin-based Ryanair is among companies well-known for hitting consumers with charges outside the headline price, such as for excess baggage, while mobile phone contracts and payday loans also face increased scrutiny under the proposals. The Commissions said the current law was 'unacceptably uncertain', which risks damaging businesses as well as consumers. Businesses face reputational damage and substantial legal costs if a charge is later found to be unfair, they said. Transparency: Companies offering payday loans, often at huge levels of interest, would also be scrutinised if the proposals were accepted . Other recommendations from the Commissions include more powers to remove legal jargon from the contracts entered by consumers when they purchase computer software, designed to limit the product's use. The so-called end user licence agreements (EULAs) should be expressed in 'plain, intelligible language'. Professor Hector MacQueen, Scottish Law Commissioner, said: 'The software industry has argued that consumer legislation does not apply to some EULAs as they are 'licences' rather than 'contracts'. Our recommendations close this supposed loophole.'","Law reform may bring an end to nasty surprises in small print of contracts .

Confession: Sir David Nicholson has revealed that dozens of NHS staff have signed gag clauses . Hundreds of NHS staff forced to sign gagging clauses to stop them revealing poor care and abuse they witnessed in hospitals will at last be free to speak out. Head of the health service, Sir David Nicholson, has admitted that a new ban on the silencing agreements will also be applied retrospectively, allowing whistleblowers who were suppressed for years to reveal the truth. The embattled NHS boss yesterday was questioned by MPs about why £15million was handed over to 400 departing doctors, nurses and managers in an attempt to ensure their silence. He confirmed that 44 former members of staff had signed confidentiality agreements this year at a cost of £1.3million, even though the clauses are no longer valid. The controversial chief executive said that if necessary he would write to the affected workers to tell them they were now free to speak out. 'If it means writing to all individuals who are involved in this to explain arrangements, that’s what we’ll do,' he told the Public Accounts Committee. The Mail revealed last week that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had banned gagging clauses with immediate effect to prevent whistleblowers being silenced from raising issues in the public interest such as patient safety, death rates and poor care. It was confirmed yesterday that these will apply retrospectively to all NHS staff already subjected to them, raising the prospect of an flood of damaging stories about poor care being made public. The new rules were inspired by the Stafford Hospital scandal, which many believe could have been detected earlier if workers had been allowed to speak out. Departing staff will be given a new legal right to raise issues that could be in the public interest, such as patient safety, death rates and poor care. Ban: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week announced that gag clauses would no longer be allowed . ‘There has been a culture where people felt if you speak up about problems in the NHS you didn’t love the NHS. Actually, it’s exactly the opposite,’ Mr Hunt said last week. ‘We need a culture of openness and transparency if we are going to stop another Mid Staffs from happening. 'The era of gagging NHS staff from raising their real worries about patient care must come to an end.’ Senior figures in the NHS had warned that the case of whistleblower Gary Walker, who broke a gagging clause to speak to the Mail about high death rates, was the tip of the iceberg. Mr Walker claimed he was sacked as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals on a trumped-up charge after raising concerns about patient safety. The father of two said he accepted a so-called supergag as part of a settlement package of an unfair dismissal claim, reported to be at least £500,000, in 2010. He broke the terms to speak out last month about a ‘culture of fear’ in the NHS. He claimed Sir David Nicholson ignored him when he raised concerns about patient safety in 2009. Sir David was yesterday quizzed by MPs over the £48,900 he racked up in expenses over the course of last year. He insisted he needed to travel in first-class trains even when going home to his wife, so that he could work on the journey.","Sir David Nicholson tells MPs 44 departing workers signed gag clauses .

Three members of a sex bondage ring were ordered to stand trial . Monday after six days of lurid testimony during which investigators . outlined how they believe a Camp Pendleton Marine's wife was unwittingly . lured to a violent death when she agreed to go on a dinner cruise. Superior . Court Judge K. Michael Kirkman said evidence suggested that 22-year-old . Brittany Killgore was the victim of a plan to act out a fantasy. He . ordered Louis Perez, 46, Dorothy Maraglino, 37, and Jessica Lopez, 25, . to face trial on charges of murder, kidnapping, torture, attempted . sexual battery and conspiracy. Going forward: Louis Perez, 46, Dorothy Maraglino, 37, and Jessica Lopez, 25, will face trial on charges of murder, kidnapping, torture, attempted sexual battery and conspiracy . Tricked: Brittany Killgore, 22, never wanted to participate in the bizarre sex games that she was subjected to before her murder, prosecutors say . Despite . the discovery of Killgore's blood in Perez's car the day after her . disappearance, defense attorneys argued that physical evidence was . lacking. Lopez's attorney, Sloan Ostbye, called her client 'the . perfect slave' in the triangle and said her role explained why Lopez . authored a handwritten letter taking full blame for Killgore's death. In . the letter, Lopez claimed she killed Killgore out of fear that the . woman would steal Perez, whom she described as her 'master.' 'It's not a confession letter, it's an exoneration letter ... to help mistress and master,' Ostbye said. Killgore . disappeared in April 2012 after borrowing a purple evening gown for the . cruise, according to prosecutors. Her nude, strangled body was four . days later near Lake Skinner, north of San Diego. Defendant: Dorothy Maraglino, also known as 'Dee', owned the San Diego house and was responsible for most of the decision making, even though Louis Perez was her 'sex master' Contract of terms: Maraglino ran the household when Louis Perez - who was only there sporadically - was away . Defendant: Jessica Lopez is also accused of the kidnap and murder of Brittany Killgore, 22, wife of a Camp Pendleton Marine . Earlier Monday, . the lead detective testified that a document attributed to Maraglino . identifies her as a participant in a beating and asphyxiation. 'We . had the best of intentions and any injury or loss of life should be . considered an accident,' read the document recovered from a CD. Detective . Brian Patterson, who read the document aloud, said investigators also . found whips, paddles, videos and other evidence of a sex bondage . activity at Maraglino's home in Fallbrook, north of San Diego. Another . San Diego County sheriff's detective, Daniel Pierce, testified that . cellphone towers traced Lopez's phone to the area where Killgore's body . was found. The phone was located in the area shortly before 4 a.m., . several hours after Killgore disappeared. Alternate lifestyle: Prosecutors say Louis Ray Perez led a bondage sex ring and was active in playing out violent sex fantasies with his two lovers . Suspects: Prosecutors say Dorothy Maraglino (left) and Jessica Lynn Lopez (right) were part of a bondage sex ring and helped to torture and murder Killgore . Last week, Elizabeth . Hernandez, who was identified in court as the victim's best friend, . testified that she and Killgore became acquainted with the defendants in . 2011 after Hernandez responded to an ad selling a fertility monitor on a . website used by military families. She said they used to socialize with . them but never participated in their alternative lifestyle in which . Perez played the master, Maraglino was the mistress and Lopez was the . slave. Hernandez testified that she and Killgore had a falling out . in 2012 as the victim prepared to divorce her husband, Lance Cpl. Cory . Killgore, who was serving in Afghanistan at the time of his wife's . death. She said Brittany Killgore started dating Hernandez's brother, and they started referring to her as 'the disease.' A woman who lived in the same house . testified Tuesday about the bizarre relationship between the trio - . including who was the 'master' and who controlled the house. The unidentified woman said that defendant Dorothy . Maraglino, also known as 'Dee', owned the San Diego house and was . responsible for most of the decision making, even though Louis Perez was . her 'sex master'. All three defendants are believed to have participated in an alternative lifestyle that included bondage and sadomasochism. They engaged in those activities in . the house, prosecutors have said, the same house where Killgore is . believed to have been killed. 'I believe that Dee did most of the . controlling in the house,' the witness testified on the second day of a . preliminary hearing, and added that there was a 'contract' that laid out . the rules of their relationship. Estranged: Brittany Killgore, right, filed for divorce from husband Cory, left, three days before her disappearance . Fears: Cory, right, returned from Afghanistan after hearing about the disappearance of his wife, left . Maraglino ran the household when Perez - who was only there sporadically - was away. 'It’s her house so she would make the rules in his absence,' the woman said. Prosecutors and investigators have . said that Killgore was not involved in the alternative lifestyle . described in court, according to UT San Diego. The three have pleaded not guilty to . killing Killgore, who vanished last year . while her estranged husband was serving in Afghanistan. Prosecutors contend that Killgore met . the trio when she and a friend went to a home in Fallbrook, north of . San Diego, to buy an item being sold online, according to the North . County Times. Killgore . turned down Perez's offer. However, later in the day, she sent him a . text message asking if she knew anyone who could help her move. 'Party with me tonight & you’ll have five guys there in the morning,' he replied. Killgore was last seen April 13 in a . borrowed purple evening gown, three days after she filed for divorce . from Lance Cpl Cory Killgore. Authorities have cleared him of any . involvement in her death. Authorities contend that Killgore was . kidnapped and made an unwilling participant in bondage and torture . before she was strangled and her nude body left in a ditch near Lake . Skinner in Riverside County. San Diego County sheriff's detectives . said they found 'bondage-type sex apparatuses, toys and tools' in the . Fallbrook home where the trio lived. Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton US Marine base . Newly unsealed documents listed numerous bondage objects seized as evidence from the house of Louis Perez, Dorothy Maraglino and  Jessica Lynn Lopez. A partial list follows: . Unsealed Court documents previously revealed that police seized whips, sex toys, rope and pulleys, a document . titled 'Slave Rules', duct tape, a stun baton and other bondage . instruments from the house. Investigators . found Killgore's blood and hair on several of the items. Investigators said they believe all . three were with Killgore at the home shortly after she apparently sent a . desperate text message to a friend that simply said: 'Help'. In an affidavit filed in court last year, a detective said the trio may have targeted Killgore for 'unusual sexual fetishes'. Perez was arrested on April 15 on suspicion of possessing a stolen assault rifle and was later charged with murder. Lopez was arrested on April 17 at a San Diego hotel where she was discovered with self-inflicted cuts. They also found a letter in which . Lopez allegedly claimed that she killed Killgore out of fear that the . woman would steal away Perez, whom she described as her 'master'. Lopez said she tried to chop up . Killgore's body with power tools before dumping it near the lake, but . the body was found hours later. The letter also contended that Perez . and Maraglino weren't responsible for the killing.

A spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said the reactors were not affected by the power outage and said staff were preparing a back-up system in case the repairs did not fix the problem. New aerial photo of the Fukushima plant shows the reactor buildings that were damaged by the 2011 tsunami . Masayuki Ono said: 'If the worst comes to the worst, we have a backup water injection system.' The command centre at the plant suffered a brief power failure just before 7pm local time (10am GMT) yesterday, knocking out the cooling facilities for four fuel ponds. Electricity was quickly restored to the command centre, and by Tuesday afternoon (this morning, London time) the cooling system had been restored at one of the pools, but three - the pools in reactors 1, 3 and 4, were still broken at 6pm in Japan (9am GMT). Having investigated the cause of the power cut, the company concluded that it might be due to problems with each of the switchboards for the pools., and began to prepare spare switchboards for use if it could not fix the original ones. TEPCO said that while the temperature in the affected pools had risen slightly, it was still well below the target control temperature. It said the reactors were unaffected and no other abnormalities were found. This image from 2011 shows a spent fuel storage pool at one of the damaged reactors in the power plant . The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the plant's power and cooling systems, causing three reactor cores to melt and fuel storage pools to overheat. Since then, the plant is now using makeshift systems.  This latest incident is a major test for TEPCO to see if it has learned anything from 2011's disaster. TEPCO, which has been accused of a string of cover-ups, was heavily criticsed by local media today for waiting hours before disclosing details of the power cut. Its spokeman Mr Ono acknowledged that the plant was vulnerable, saying: 'Fukushima Dai-ichi still runs on makeshift equipment and we are trying to switch to something more permanent and dependable, which is more desirable. The March 2011 tsunami crippled the Fukushima plant when waves destroyed cooling facilities and reactors overheated . 'Considering the equipment situation, we may be pushing a little too hard.' Mr Ono said the utility did not immediately try to switch to a back-up cooling system because doing so without finding and fixing the cause could lead to a repeat of the problem. There is a backup cooling system but no backup outside power, he said. Regulators have previously raised concerns about the makeshift equipment, and have urged the plant to switch them to a more permanent arrangement. The operator still has to remove melted, fatally radioactive fuel from the reactors before fully decommissioning the plant, which officials say could take 40 years. The tsunami on 11 March 2011 saw huge waves knock out the cooling facilities at the nuclear power plant.  As a result the reactors overheated and went into meltdown. The plant has since been stabilised but the full effect of the disaster is yet to be ascertained. Yoshihide Suga, the chief government spokesman, sought to allay concerns today, saying: 'In a sense, we have put in place measures that leave no room for worry.'","Temperatures are rising at three fuel storage ponds at Fukushima Dai-ichi .

Footballer Shane Duffy faced criticism online after a tweet sent from his account showed support for the IRA . Everton and Ireland defender Shane Duffy has apologised after support for the IRA was sent from his Twitter account during a St Patrick’s Day booze-up. The 21-year-old, who switched from playing for Northern Ireland to the Republic in 2010, apologised to his followers on Twitter, claiming that someone else had accessed his account. The tweet, which was retweeted on Duffy’s account, read: ‘UP THE RA’ and prompted followers to  berate him for supporting the organisation. The tweet was originally posted accompanied by #COYBIG, which stands for ‘Come on You Boys in Green’. The defender, who also posted  a picture of two pints of Guinness and a photo of him out celebrating St Patrick’s Day with friends, apologised, saying that it wasn’t  him who retweeted support of  the IRA. After a barrage of abuse, the under-21 Ireland captain tweeted earlier today: ‘Haha wow this Wernt me!!!!’ He wrote again later, adding: ‘Sorry everyone some little paddy had my phone last night tweets wernt me.. sorry if it offended anyone!! cant leave ur phone anywhere now!!’ Commenting on the amount of abuse he was getting on Twitter following the posting, he wrote: ‘Wow so much hate on something I didn’t do. 'Fair enough gotta take it because its my twitter. And again It was not me who tweeted...And retweeted loads last night! Really am sorry if it offended anyone..

It’s making it a million times worse.’ The defender replied: ‘u want me to make a lie up? It’s what happened!!!’ He said that most of the abuse he was getting was from Rangers and Northern Ireland fans, adding: ‘Mostly all rangers and Northern Ireland fans giving me abuse? Give it a rest.’ Shane Duffy posted a series of apologies for the retweet, which said 'UP THE RA' and claimed it was not him who reposted the message . Last night Under-21s manager Noel King said he had no comment to make about the row. Last May, Sunderland and Ireland winger James McClean quit Twitter after being targeted by online sectarian death threats. The 23-year-old, from Derry, deleted his Twitter account. At the time a source close to the player added: ‘He has decided to stop using it as a direct result of the abuse and death threats posted. He is unlikely to use it in future.’ He returned to Twitter again, but deleted his account after tweeting that rebel anthem The Broad Black Brimmer by the Wolfe Tones was his favourite song.

The GP known as Dr Death wants to set up Britain's first suicide 'support group', it emerged today. Dr Michael Irwin, who was given the name after helping people visit a euthanasia clinic, is launching 'Die-alogue' which will share advice on euthanasia, Swiss suicide clinic Dignitas and end-of-life care. Retired Dr Irwin, who lives in Surrey, said he hoped members of the club, which is due to launch next month in Hove, East Sussex, would help each other travel abroad to commit suicide if necessary. Plans: Dr Michael Irwin, who was given the name after helping people visit a euthanasia clinic, is launching 'Die-alogue' which will share advice on euthanasia, Swiss suicide clinic Dignitas and end-of-life care . The 80-year-old doctor said: ‘The topic of rational suicide should be discussed. I want people to provide one another with financial, moral and emotional support. ‘People could support each other by travelling abroad to the Dignitas clinic. Sometimes the person who wants to go to Dignitas has no one to help them. This group would aim to help that.’ Dr Irwin does not advocate suicide in healthy people but believes those who assist people with a terminal illness should not be prosecuted for doing so. The group will also discuss care plans should a person suffer a serious illness, such as locked-in syndrome or a stroke. Dr Irwin said: ‘Some people want to stay alive - they want all the care they can receive - whereas others do not. This group would help people make these decisions while they can.’ Controversial: Around 150 Britons are thought to have died at Dignitas, which exploits liberal Swiss laws . Dr Irwin told how the idea for the group came from the Brighton and Hove Fabian Society, where he gave a talk recently. 'Some people want to stay alive - they want all the care they can receive - whereas others do not. This group would help people make these decisions while they can' Dr Michael Irwin . He has also been in contact with an 83-year-old dementia sufferer who plans to die at Dignitas. The British man would be the first to end his life at the Swiss clinic purely because of dementia. In 2011 Dr Irwin revealed how a 91-year-old from Eastbourne had contacted him about Dignitas. He did not take her to Switzerland but police officers interviewed him, making no arrest. Dr Irwin has been investigated in the past over assisted suicide – an offence carrying a 14-year jail sentence – but has never been arrested. Around 150 Britons are thought to have died at Dignitas, which exploits liberal Swiss laws on assisted dying. A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'The Suicide Act 1961 states that a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, shall be liable to prosecution. We have an obligation to investigate any specific offence that is alleged to us.'","Dr Michael Irwin: 'Die-alogue' group set to be launched in Hove next month .

A Formula One car that was 'forgotten about' in a warehouse for almost three decades is expected to fetch more than £5million at auction. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 - described as 'one of the most significant motor cars of the 20th Century' - was driven by five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio. The German-made car contains many features which were innovative at the time, including a fuel-injected engine, lightweight chassis and improved brakes. The 2.5 litre Mercedes-Benz, being inspected by auction house chairman Robert Brooks, was driven by Juan Manuel Fangio during his 1954 World Championship winning Formula One season . The car, pictured being driven by Fangio, contained innovative features including fuel-injected engine . Racing historian Doug Nye said: 'The fist time I saw this car I needed oxygen. It's landmark technology and it was driven by a landmark driver.' Secrecy surrounds the owner of the iconic car and auction house Bonhams would not comment on where the car was found. It will be sold in its current condition with noticeable blemishes and dirt. Mr Nye said: 'What's so special about it is that it has this wonderful, untouched patina. 'Some people think it looks grotty - that's not the point - the really rare cars today are the unrestored ones. 'Every car that's restored has lost a part of its history because it's been obliterated by repainting or by rebuilding. Nothing's been obliterated on this, it's just a beautiful survivor.' He added that he did not mind if the car was bought by an individual or an institution, but he hoped it would go to 'an owner who really understands and an owner who really cares'. Fangio won both the 1954 Swiss and German Grand Prix in the famous car . The car will be sold at the Goodwood Festival and experts say it could go for more than its £5million estimate . Juan Manuel Fangio dominated the first decade of Formula One racing and is one of the legends of the sport. The Argentine won five Formula One World Drivers' Championships titles. That record was only broken by Michael Schumacher 46 years later. Fangio took the title in 1951 and then every year between 1954 and 1957. He is also the only Argentine driver to have won his country's Grand Prix. In the 1954 season, he began racing for Maserati until Mercedes-Benz entered the competition in mid-season. He won eight out of the 12 races that year, including both the German and Swiss Grand Prix in the iconic car. Fangio requested a car - chassis '00006' - had open wheels to cope with the twisty 14.2-mile Nurburgring road circuit. He then repeated the feat at the Swiss Grand Prix. After his retirement, Fangio became Mercedes-Benz Argentina Honorary President for Life and sold cars. He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990 and died in 1995 at the age of 84. The car was unveiled last night by Bonhams at its New Bond Street sale room. Auction house chairman Robert Brooks said: 'This is my fifth decade in the business and it was the most exciting discovery that I've made. 'We've had a couple of cars that have made over £5million and our thought is that this will exceed that.' Mr Brooks would not comment on where the car was found, but said he hoped the highest bidder would take it back to Germany to enable it to be driven again. 'It's been stored in a warehouse and largely forgotten about for nearly 30 years. 'Before it went into storage it had been recently run and run well. 'It's complete, and essentially a trip back to the Mercedes-Benz works - which would be the perfect place to get the thing running again - would probably see it back on the track or on the road in demonstration. 'It's all there to be put back together.' The car will be sold by Bonhams at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July. Fangio drove the 2.5 litre straight-9 Mercedes in his victories at the 1954 German and Swiss Grand Prix races. They were the first victories to be achieved in succession by the Mercedes-Benz factory after the war. Mr Brooks said: 'My motoring auction career spans five decades and I have been privileged to have handled some of the world's most desirable and important motor cars. 'To handle the sale of this legendary W196 Grand Prix Car – the only one out of captivity– could well be the pinnacle.'","The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 driven by racing legend Juan Manuel Fangio .

A bigamist attorney who secretly married his stripper mistress in Jamaica but was caught when his original wife opened the letter containing the marriage licence, has been suspended from practising law for six months. From the outside Joseph Rosenzweig seemed every bit the honest, successful, hard-working family man. Born into a wealthy family, he had married original wife Theresa in 1985 and the couple had gone on to have two daughters together, setting up home in a plush apartment in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York. Encounter: Bigamist lawyer Joseph Rosenzweig met his second wife Radiah Nunez at the New York Dolls Strip Club . But everything would change during . what he would later describe as a 'boys' night out' to the New York . Dolls strip club on the Fourth of July weekend in 1995. It was there that the then 38-year-old Rosenzweig met 23-year-old striptease artist Radiah Givens Nunez for the first time. Rosenzweig was smitten and became a regular visitor to the club to watch her perform. She told him she had moved to New York . from Colorado after receiving a scholarship from the Alvin Alley Dance . Company and was stripping to pay the bills. After a few months they started sleeping together. According to a report in the New York Daily News, Nunez . quickly became his mistress. The couple took expensive holidays . together. He gave her a credit card, paid for all of her bills and even . provided an allowance. Paradise wedding: Bigamist lawyer Joseph Rosenzweig married stripper . Radiah Nunez in Negril, Jamaica in 2004. But his other wife opened the letter . containing the marriage licence . In 2000, Rosenzweig bought her studio . apartment in Chelsea, then two years later, he upgraded her to a better . Seventh Ave. studio. Rosenzweig . appeared so helplessly in love with Nunez, that he turned a blind eye . to the fact she was a Santerian priestess and would perform animal . sacrifices in the apartment as a key part of the Afro-Caribbean . religion. He later told a court how she had set up a 'very large altar with all kinds of unusual things upon it,' inside the apartment. In around 2002  Rosenzweig first suggested to Nunez that they should get married. Second life: Rosenzweig conducted his affair in secret while living with his wife Theresa and their two daughters in a plush apartment in Tribeca . He . told the court referee: 'I wanted to demonstrate to her my commitment . to her in terms of our relationship and the way that I thought I could . do that was by marrying her even though we both knew it was not a valid . marriage.' They couple . married at the luxurious Rockhouse hotel in Negril, Jamaica in 2004 with . Rosenzweig, completely disregarding the potential possible consequences . of lying on amarriage certificate, and claiming he was a bachelor. Back at home they planned to continue to conduct the relationship in the same way with Rosenzweig living with his original wife and daughters, but would spend most of their . But just a few months later their secret was out when FedEx sent the Jamaican marriage certificate to the Tribeca flat and Theresa opened the letter. Like Rosenzweig, Theresa had also come form a wealthy background and had insisted on a prenuptial agreement. Theresa confronted her husband about the certificate. He tried to deny it at first but was evebntually foprced to tell all. By April 2005 Rosezweig had stopped seeing NUnex and had cut off financial support. Their marriage was finally annulled in 2007. Two years later he attempted to sue Nunez, claiming two mortgages which he had taken out on the property had constituted a loan to Nunez. However Nunez, who now runs an online radio station spirituality, won and the pair reached a settlement. Last month, Rosenzweig was suspended from practising law for six months by the state court system’s Departmental Disciplinary Committee. He vowed to be 'honest, trustworthy, and not engage in any conduct that would reflect badly on myself or the profession, ' telling the court: 'I betrayed the people who love me, who trust me, and everybody who knows me,' he said.","Father-of-two Joseph Rosenzweig married original wife Theresa in 1985 .

Roberto Charles Troyan, 63, who was known as Robert, died on March 8 at his flat in Mount Street, Mayfair, central London. Police believe that he was attacked at some point before 4pm that day, and are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward. Trusting: Friends of Mr Troyan described him as a 'larger than life' character, who 'trusted strangers too much' Murder probe launched: The body of Robert Troyan, 63, was discovered at his luxury flat in this apartment block in Mount Street, Mayfair . Last night they arrested the . 36-year-old on suspicion of Mr Troyan's murder and he is being . questioned at a police station in south London. Mr Troyan's friend Sean McGuigan told the Evening Standard last week that he believed the 63-year-old was 'too trusting'. Mr Troyan was discovered with a gash to his head in a pool of blood in the kitchen of his luxury rented Mayfair flat . He said: 'A lot of people around him . were after his money.

A post-mortem examination confirmed he died of head injuries. His . mother, Marie, 83, described her son as 'one in a million' but said . there had been a 'terrible change in circumstances' after the death of . his late partner, architect and interior designer Anthony Feldman - . whose clients included Princess Michael of Kent and former Tory Cabinet . minister Jonathan Aitken. The couple were the first to become civil partners, and the ceremony was held just a month before Mr Feldman’s death at 52. Friends of Mr Troyan described him as a 'larger than life' character, who 'trusted strangers too much'. Mr Troyan was born in Italy to a wealthy . family but lived in the US for most of his youth. Mr Troyan studied art . at college in Boston before moving to Britain, where he met Mr Feldman . in 1983. An obituary in the Times after Mr .

Johannesburg as an 18-year-old to study and went on to become an . internationally successful interior designer and architect who took on . commissions in London, Paris, New York, Hungary and Turkey. Affluent: Flats on the street sell for £2-3million, while a nine-bedroom property on Mount Street is currently on the market for £32million . Mr Troyan and Mr Feldman worked on . many design projects together, but their most cherished one was the top . two storeys of the 1782 Henry Holland house in Mayfair they shared, . where they painted the floors and fireplace in eight shades of pale grey . and several shades of white.

They became the first to take part in a . civil partnership in Westminster in 2005 after being given dispensation . to pre-empt the official start date because Mr Feldman had terminal . cancer. He died aged 52 eight days after the ceremony. About six years after Mr Feldman’s . death, Mr Troyan moved out of that flat and into the flat, also in . Mayfair, where he was found murdered. A neighbour in his former flat said: . ‘He [Mr Troyan] came from a very moneyed background in America. 'He was . totally devastated by Anthony’s death.

A dedicated family doctor, described as the 'perfect GP', killed himself after becoming severely depressed over his son needing a kidney transplant, an inquest was told yesterday. Dr John King, 51, was so anxious about his son Michael's renal failure diagnosis that he could 'barely speak' and had suicidal thoughts. But just ten days before Michael was due to have his operation, Dr King hanged himself at the family home. His wife of 25 years Pamela . discovered him in the garage of their house in . Congleton, Cheshire. Dr Pamela King, 52, who is also a GP, told an inquest into her . husband's death that the night before he died on September 11, last year, she cuddled up to Dr King and told him she loved him. She said: 'I asked him ""do you love me?"" And he said ""well who wouldn't"". Dr King was on sick leave from Biddulph Medical Centre where he was a senior partner. His wife told the hearing at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court: 'The following morning, I went to work. 'I had asked him ""What are you going to do today?"" 'He just smirked and said ""I'm doing dusting aren't I?"" I came back home and then I found him.' Dr King was described as an 'old school' doctor who talked at length with patients about their conditions rather than 'bat them away with pills.' The hearing was told the GP was badly affected when Michael was diagnosed with kidney problems. He had twice previously threatened to kill himself after putting a knife to his neck. Despite having no history of mental health issues, Dr King was taken to a health centre in March last year where he admitted to doctors he was developing suicidal thoughts. He suffered sleep problems and he appeared to be 'genuinely stressed.' Dr Pamela King said her husband also suffered from cognitive difficulties and was unable to make decisions. It was decided he stay in hospital and was discharged on May 30. She said: 'He actually couldn't make that decision - he actually couldn't speak. 'His mental state deteriorated . rapidly. He had low mood and was getting upset about trivial matters. He . suffered low confidence and negative thinking.' After he left hospital he was put on medication and remained on sick leave from the surgery. He received continued care from the mental health team but social workers said he did not want to engage in treatment. Dr King was on sick leave from Biddulph Medical Centre, pictured, at the time of his death . The hearing was told the GP felt particularly anxious as the family waited for news on whether Michael could have a kidney transplant. Dr Pamela King said: 'He didn't think he was ever going to get better. In his own mind, there was never any glimmer of hope. 'If I told him he was getting better, he didn't want to hear it. He didn't engage with the mental health team.' The family were told Michael's operation would take place on September 21, but Dr King took his own life on September 11. Social worker Samantha Harris, who visited Dr King weekly, said he did not fully engage in their activities and instead spent a lot of time in bed.

A sister who betrayed the trust of her bed-ridden brother by plundering his life savings has been jailed for two years. Christine Davies, 57, offered to take . control of her brother Keith Hardman's finances in 2007 when he went into adult . social care after suffering a stroke. But Lancaster Crown Court yesterday heard how she stole £22,000 from her brother's money over the course of four years while he was in a care home. Jailed: Christine Davies, 57, pictured left, has been sentenced to two years in prison after she admitted stealing £22,000 from her brother Keith Hardman, right, who entrusted her with his finances after suffering a stroke . Speaking after the court case, Mr Hardman, 62, said: 'I never want to see her again, I can't forgive her. That was my money, I earned that. I'm never going to get my money back - that is what I wanted most.' Mr Hardman, a former gas worker, was admitted into adult social care in 2006 following a stroke which left him with limited speech and movement. A year later Davies offered to help her brother by taking control of his finances but then stole his money to spend herself. Last month Davies pleaded guilty to stealing £22,000 from her brother. A total of £37,500 was unaccounted for, the court heard. Speaking with the help of carers, he told of the shock of discovering his own sister had been stealing from him as he lay unaware in his care home bed. It wasn't until an anonymous letter was sent to police that Davies' deceit was uncovered, a letter which Mr Hardman says he will always be thankful for. Before being caught, Davies frequently told Mr Hardman he didn't have the money for treats or trips out of the home. Davies managed to swindle thousands from the hard-working Manchester United fan's bank account. Mr Hardman said: 'I was angry. I was shocked. I was upset.' Betrayed: Keith Hardman, 62, says he will never forgive his sister who took control of his finances when he went into adult care and then stole thousands of pounds of his money . The court was told that during the four years she stole the money from her brother his income was £77,000. Police financial investigators worked . out about £40,000 of this had been spent 'legitimately' by Davies on . buying items for her brother. However, more than £37,500 was unaccounted for. Davies admitted stealing £22,000 of this. Judge Tony Lancaster said he had to send Davies to prison in light of the 'serious nature of the breach of trust'. DC Lindsey Bolton, lead officer on the . case, said after the hearing: 'This is a serious crime of financial . abuse on a vulnerable adult. 'The victim in this case is bed bound, he has suffered multiple strokes and can only . communicate with gestures and limited . words. He had placed trust in his sister in order to sort out his . finances for his care, as his disability and health had prevented him . from doing it. 'The crime first came to the attention . of the police when there was an outstanding bill for the victim's care . at the nursing home. This debt could have influenced the amount of care . he could receive even though he had sufficient money of his own to pay . for it. Unbeknown to him the money had been spent by the defendant.' Since her arrest Mr Hardman has refused to see his scheming sister but has received a Christmas card. Since Davies' crimes have been uncovered, staff at the home claim the terrible discovery has given Mr Hardman a new lease of life and he has started to treat himself and take part in social trips to the zoo and the cinema.","Keith Hardman went into adult social care in 2006 after suffering a stroke .

A legal professor has found himself on the other side of the law after he was arrested and following a bizarre tirade against students. Adjunct University of Oregon professor James L. Olmsted was captured on video engaging with students holding a pro-immigration demonstration, pushing them, and pocketing one of the student’s phones. During his six-minute profanity-laced outburst, he chastised the students, saying: ‘If you want this country back, start a f****** war. Get a gun, shoot me first, I’m right here.’ Scroll down for video . Confrontation: Adjunct University of Oregon law professor James L. Olmsted, left, confronted a group of student protestors on March 14, telling them to 'f****** start a war' Gloves off: During the exchange, Olmsted took off his jacket and pushed a student after the student tried to come between the professor and a female protestor . In the video, which was uploaded by a student, Olmsted is seen confronting a group of students from the Students Against Imperialism group had put up a mock-border and were stopping passers-by to alert them of issues at the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as the Palestinian border. Legal eagle: Olmsted got his J.D. from the University of California at Davis School of Law in 1987 . At the beginning of the video, Olmsted can be seen approaching the students and telling them while their efforts are well-intentioned, no real change would come from four or five students making a mock checkpoint. ‘Start a f****** war… stop being p******!’ he shouts to the group of students during the March 14 incident. ‘Do something! ‘To make something happen, you need lots of people in action, and get hurt,’ he continued, referring to when Native Americans ‘took over Alcatraz. Very brave.’ The group Indians of All Tribes (AIT) occupied the prison in San Francisco Bay from 1969 to 1971.Olmsted can then be seen removing his leather motorcycle jacket and aggressively challenging a male student. ‘What do you want to talk about?’ he asks, removing his glasses and throwing them to the sidewalk. The young woman recording the incident, Diana Salazar, says at one point: ‘This is an aggressive tone. I’m feeling a little threatened right now.’ Ms Salazar was pushed out of the way when Olmsted reached for his glasses. The faculty member then grabs the woman’s phone, though several more minutes of audio can be heard with students saying they feel threatened in the emotionally-charged environment. As The Oregonian reports, Olmsted, 58, was arrested and charged with two counts of physical intimidation and second-degree theft. In your face: Olmsted seemed to be trying to make a point that the protestors needed to make a bigger statement to instigate change; one of the protestors later called his demonstration 'racist' He was also given a letter of trespass, which means he is not allowed to enter the campus for at least 18 months. University spokesman Phil Weiler told the paper that the teaching responsibilities of Olmsted, an adjunct professor, have been reassigned to another faculty member. Ms Salazar, the group’s co-founder, told student newspaper the Daily Emerald that they were prepared for controversy, but not for a ranting professor. She also said that while there has been support from the University of Oregon faculty and staff, the group has also been accused of provoking the law professor. Historic: The University of Oregon is located in Eugine and was founded in 1876 . Olmsted’s attorney, Mike Arnold, told the student paper that not every vantage point of the story has been told. ‘Even with the ability to record parts of a situation with audio and video, you’re still going to have huge gaps in the story,’ he said, adding that there are legal issues under Oregon state law over concealed recording devices.

Hearing: Latifa Bouabdillah is suing Commerzbank for £1million after the firm sacked her when they found out she was taking her former company to an employment tribunal . A high-flying female City banker was compared to a criminal and sacked from her job because her boss discovered she was suing her old bank for sex discrimination, a tribunal heard. Latifa Bouabdillah resigned as vice president and director of financial giant Deutsche Bank at the end of 2011 and launched a bid to sue the company for £1million over claims men were promoted ahead of her and received bonuses up to three times larger than hers. She then moved to rival banking giant Commerzbank AG, but claims she was sacked from the firm when her bosses found out about her sexism case against her former employer when an article was published about it. Miss Bouabdillah told the Central London Employment Tribunal that she kept her claim secret from her new employers because she feared they wouldn't offer her the £150,000 a year post as head of product engineering and sales in their Exotic Vanilla Funds Team if they knew. When her new employers found out about the suit they told her that she had put their reputation 'at risk' and that the matter had been escalated to 'very senior' people in the bank's German head office, it is claimed. In a witness statement submitted to the tribunal she said: 'So I understood that this was causing big issues internally. This worried me a lot. I could see that this was potentially very damaging to my career with the respondent and my career in general. 'They asked me if this was the first time I had sued an institution, I said yes and I am not intending to do it again and that the job with the respondent would allow me to move on with my life.' She claims she was likened to a common criminal by the bank's senior HR partner Nigel Marsden and was left feeling 'distressed, demeaned and humiliated' by her bosses who interrogated her, it was said. She said: 'Towards the end of the conversation Nigel compared me to someone who had been shoplifting and said that should be disclosed. 'I was shocked and said how could he compare me to a shoplifter, and said there was no similarity between my case and shoplifting. 'I said that I was the victim in my . claims. I said that I didn't understand why this was such an issue for . them. It seemed to me that they were just looking for an excuse to . dismiss me. 'I felt . rejected. People who had been very sympathetic had completely changed, . so I said I would leave the bank if they wanted me to. 'The . meeting upset me a lot. I had been compared to a criminal. I felt that . for him I was guilty until proven innocent. I left the meeting feeling . terrible, humiliated and very worried about my future.' Taking action: Ms Bouabdillah launched a bid to sue Deutsche Bank for sexual discrimination over claims men received bonuses three times larger than hers . Suing: Latifa Bouabdillah leaves Kingsway Employment tribunal in London today. The former vice president and director is suing Commerzbank for £1 million saying male colleagues got up to three times the bonus she got . At a meeting on June 11th last year, Miss Bouabdillah was dismissed from her job - less than a month after she was appointed to the post. She is now suing the bank for sex discrimination and victimisation. Commerzbank denies the allegations and claims it dismissed the banker because she had broken their trust. In a statement Guy Middleton, head of . sales trading at the Exotic Vanilla Funds Team, said he was suspicious . about why she had left Deutsche Bank and repeatedly asked her . recruitment consultant, but was reassured it was because she wanted to . move to a smaller team. New case: Ms Bouabdillah was then sacked by her new employer Commerzbank AG when they found out about the case. She is now suing the firm for unfair dismissal . He said: 'I was initially unsure whether Latifa should remain in the team as I initially thought that the trust between her and the team might be recoverable. 'But as time went on I felt that she had made a conscious and considered decision to withhold information which made me feel that she could no longer be trusted.' The hearing has been adjourned while the tribunal considers its judgement. A Commerzbank spokesman said: 'We believe this claim has no merit and are defending it accordingly. 'Ms Bouabdillah’s employment was terminated because of a clear breach of trust and confidence by the employee.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Latifa Bouabdillah resigned as vice president of the Deutsche Bank in 2011 .

A 19-year-old American musician has been jailed for at least five years after being convicted of murdering an Irish exchange student in Japan. US musician Richard Hinds, 19, from Memphis, Tennessee, was said to have drugged 21-year-old Nicola Furlong in a bar after meeting her and a friend as they returned from a Nicki Minaj concert in Tokyo. He and a friend, who was also American, then took the unconscious girls back to the Keio Plaza hotel in the city's Shinjuku district in wheelchairs where they sexually assaulted them. But their plan was scuppered when Nicola awoke from her stupor, at which point Hinds strangled the exchange student with a towel or tank top to cover her cries for help, the court heard. Following the sentencing today, Nicola's mother Angela today reacted angrily, declaring: 'Nicola's life was worth more than that.' Scroll down for video . Jailed: US musician Richard Hinds, left, 19, from Memphis, Tennessee, was said to have strangled Nicola Furlong, right, when she awoke as he sexually assaulted her in a hotel room . She added: 'It's good that they (judges) cleared her name. Nicola has done nothing wrong. It was all him and his lies that brought us out here. 'We still don't know the truth of what happened in that room but we know Nicola did nothing wrong, we knew that coming out anyway.' Hinds was on trial as a minor. The death penalty was not an option for judges and possible sentence was limited to up to 10 years. Nicola's father Brendan said the family had been made aware that possible sentences were limited. Popular: Nicola (left, centre) and her friend (not pictured), who is also Irish but whose . name was withheld in court, went to the city to see a concert by US . rapper Nicki Minaj (right) Family in grief: Andrew Furlong, left, his wife, Angela, right, and their daughter, Andrea, leave Tokyo District Court in Tokyo today . 'When we found out he was on trial as a minor we knew it was not going to be a hanging,' he said. Hinds stood silently as he was found guilty of strangling the student in what the presiding judge called a 'vicious' attack. His evidence was also described as at times not credible and irrational. The court ruled that Hinds had tried to taint Nicola's memory and that he had shown no remorse. Hinds and another American were accused of taking Nicola, 21, and one of her friends to the hotel after they had passed out in a bar. The Tokyo District Court ruled that Hinds strangled Nicola to keep her quiet when she regained consciousness in his hotel room. A second American man, James Blackston, a 23-year-old dancer from Los Angeles, was seen with Hinds bringing Nicola and her unnamed friend unconscious into the hotel on CCTV footage which was played to the court. He was convicted last week of sexually assaulting the second girl and sentenced to three years in jail. Nicola's sister Andrea said she felt let down by the Japanese criminal justice system. 'I'm absolutely disgusted and so angry and so hurt,' she said. Grief: Mr Furlong said the family was at least glad they managed to clear Nicola's name in court . With friends: After the concert, Nicola (top, second left) and her unnamed friend met Hinds and Blackston and went with them to a bar where both of the women passed out. Prosecutors suggested they were drugged . 'We had so much faith in the Japanese doing justice for us and I don't feel we got it.' Nicola had been studying and living about 62 miles (100km) north of Tokyo, at Takasaki City University of Economics as part of an exchange programme. According to evidence in both trials, Nicola and her friend, who is also Irish but whose name was withheld in court, went to the city to see a concert by US rapper Nicki Minaj. After the concert, the two met Hinds and Blackston and went with them to a bar. At some point both of the women passed out. Prosecutors suggested they were drugged. Security camera footage presented as evidence showed Blackston sexually assaulting Nicola's friend in a taxi on the way to the hotel, where the men borrowed wheelchairs to get the unconscious women to the rooms. Let down: Nicola, right, with her sister Andrea who said she felt 'let down' by the Japanese justice system . Fun times: Nicola poses with friends at a Japanese theme park . Prosecutors claimed Hinds strangled Nicola, a Dublin City University student from Curracloe, Co Wexford, with a towel to keep her quiet after she regained consciousness. The defence, in an attempt to explain the girls' unconscious state, claimed that they had been drinking excessively. In evidence Nicolas unnamed friend said she could not remember anything after taking a drink given to her during the evening. Nicola's mother said their belief in their daughter never wavered. 'It never faltered with us. We knew what type of little girl Nicola is. She always will be a very special little girl to us,' she said outside the court in Tokyo. 'She's not what that person (Hinds) tried to make her out to be. The whole nation, the whole world can see that now.' Spiked? In evidence Nicola's unnamed friend said she could not remember anything after taking a drink given to her during the evening. Here Nicola is pictured in a Japanese pool hall, left, and with brother Danny, right . Mr Furlong said: 'There wasn't anything we agreed with the defence, but then we are biased with Nicola. But the way they tried to paint her, not a hope in hell was she like that. 'All her friends and anyone who knew her, and I hope anyone that didn't know her, can see she was not anything like they were trying to make out. 'We got her name cleared. 'I don't want to ever hear his (Hinds') name mentioned again. I've no interest in him whatsoever.' The family said they expected to feel a sense of emptiness on returning home to Ireland after a nine-month quest for justice. Mr Furlong added: 'That's probably our start of grieving for Nicola, and she can rest in peace, hopefully she is, please God.' Hinds denied the charges against him. During his evidence he admitted lightly pressing on the 21-year-old's neck in the hotel room but denied killing her intentionally. Hinds was 19 and a minor under Japanese law when he was arrested, but was being tried in an adult court. Although murder in Japan can carry the death penalty, prosecutors sought a maximum jail sentence of 10 years.","Richard Hinds, 19, from Memphis, Tennessee, killed Nicola Furlong last May .

Russia's Foreign Ministry accused Syrian rebels of using chemical weapons to kill 16 people in an attack on a rural area near Aleppo today, calling it an extremely alarming and dangerous development. A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said: 'A case of the use of chemical weapons by the armed opposition was recorded early in the morning of March 19 in Aleppo province. 'We are very seriously concerned by the . fact that weapons of mass destruction are falling into the hands of the . rebels, which further worsens the situation in Syria and elevates the . confrontation in the country to a new level.' Scroll down for video . Syrians carry an injured man from a building that was hit by a Syrian forces airstrike in Aleppo today . Syria's President Bashar al-Assad's government and rebels blamed each other for launching a deadly chemical attack which, if confirmed, would be the first use of such weapons in the two-year conflict. Today the Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoabi insisted that the country's armed forces would never use internationally banned weapons, after the government and rebels argued over who was behind what both sides said was a chemical weapon attack near Aleppo. Speaking at a televised news conference, Mr Zoabi said: 'Syria's army leadership has stressed this before and we say it again, if we had chemical weapons we would never use them due to moral, humanitarian and political reasons. 'Our armed forces absolutely could not use, not now, nor at any time, nor in the past, any weapon banned by international law.' Britain said it was aware of such reports and said if they were true, it would 'demand a serious response' from the international community. A statement from the Foreign Office said: 'We’re aware of today’s press reports alleging that a chemical weapon was fired in the north of Syria and are looking into them. A boy, affected in what the government said was a chemical weapons attack, is treated at a hospital in Aleppo . Syrian residents inspect houses destroyed by Syrian forces in the al-Marieh area of Aleppo province . 'The use of chemical weapons would be abhorrent and universally condemned. The UK is clear that the use or proliferation of chemical weapons would demand a serious response from the international community and would force us to revisit our approach so far.' Meanwhile an international anti-chemical weapons body said it had no independent information about any use of such arms in Syria, but said it was 'closely monitoring' the situation. Ahmet Uzumcu, director general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), said it would look at media reports about what had happened and 'try to identify the symptoms which may be detected' in order to make an assessment. Residents and medics transport a Syrian Army soldier, wounded in what they said was a chemical attack near Aleppo, to hospital today . Mr Uzumcu told reporters: 'I don't think we know more than you do at the moment. Of course we have seen those reports and we are closely monitoring the situation.' Addressing a seminar held by the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, he earlier said reports that Syria had large stockpiles of such arms was a 'major source of concern'. The OPCW, the Hague-based organisation founded to oversee a ban on the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, has 188 member nations, but has struggled to bring on board countries in the Middle East. Because it has not signed the chemical weapons ban treaty and the United Nations has not intervened, Syria is under no international obligation to declare its chemical weapons, give them up or allow inspectors to monitor them. Mr Uzumcu said he would not want to send experts to a conflict zone.

Unhappy: Natasha Duffy with the lump of meat which she found in a Tesco cheese and onion pasty . A disgusted vegetarian has slammed Tesco after she found meat in her cheese and onion pasty. Natasha Duffy, 21, bought the food from a Tesco branch in Tovil, near Maidstone, Kent, but only noticed the contamination half way through eating one of two in the pack. The shop assistant said the £1.50 own-brand product is labelled suitable for vegetarians and became physically sick after realising what she may have eaten. 'I put one slice in the oven and got to eating it half way when I noticed tiny pieces of pinky coloured meat on my plate,' she said. 'So I lifted up the remaining pastry and found more pieces. They gave off a foul smell on closer examination. I wanted to throw up. 'I was quite shocked. My partner Benjamin Turner took a sniff and he too thought it didn't smell right. 'I won't be going back to Tesco anytime soon. I'll now be sending the evidence to Tesco for examination.' The supermarket chain has been experiencing a torrid time with revelations of horse meat found in products. It resulted in their shelves being cleared of thousands of items and a pledge from Tesco's top boss to source more of its meat from the UK. Chief executive Phillip Clarke told a UK farming conference last month Tesco wanted to 'reconnect' with Britain's meat industry - provided it can meet the demand. Nasty taste: Natasha said she almost vomited when she found the meat in the pasty-style slices - halfway through eating one . Now the supermarket chain have promised a thorough investigation into their latest slip-up. A spokesman said: 'We were concerned to hear about this issue, and if our customer is able to return the product to the store, we will begin a thorough investigation with the supplier. 'Alternatively, we can arrange to pick up the product at the customer's convenience.' A mum-of-two was fuming today after finding a cigarette butt in a supermarket ready meal. And furious Ellouise Maginnes said: 'This is not just any fag end, it's a Marks and Spencer fag end.' Ellouise, 37, was tucking in to a dish of root vegetables when she was hit with an 'overwhelming' stench of cigarettes. The mother-of-two realised she was chewing on something tough and when she took it out of her mouth saw what she claims is a cigarette end. Dhe said: 'The smell hit me first - it’s the kind of smell you notice straight away. 'Then there was a horrible, smoky taste in my mouth that couldn’t have been anything else but a cigarette. 'I took it out of my mouth and knew straight away what it was.' Ellouise and her husband David, 43, from Cardiff, bought the root vegetables as part of a Marks and Spencer meal deal. Ellouise said: 'I had to get my husband to check I wasn’t imagining it. 'As soon as he smelled it, he threw it down in disgust clearly realising what I said was true.' Marks and Spencer were investigating today after Ellouise made an official complaint. A company spokeswoman said: 'We’re sorry to hear about our customer’s complaint. 'Quality is extremely important to us, so we’ve asked the customer to send us the product and packaging as soon as possible so we can investigate further.'","Natasha Duffy was halfway through her meal when she found the meat .

'Lady in the Lake' killer Gordon Park read an official report into the prison suicide of mass murderer Harold Shipman more than a year before he was found dead in his own cell in Lancashire, an inquest has heard. Park was jailed for life in 2005 for murdering his teacher wife Carol with an ice axe 30 years earlier - ending what had been one of Britain's most notorious unsolved cases. But the killer was found hanged in his cell at HMP Garth, Lancashire, on January 25, 2010 - the morning of his 66th birthday. Inquest: Convicted murderer Gordon Park, pictured left, was found dead in his cell at HMP Garth in Lancashire in 2010 - a year after he read a report into how serial killer Harold Shipman, right, committed suicide in prison . Carol Park vanished in July 1976, but her badly beaten, weighted-down body was found dumped in Coniston Water, in the Lake District in 1997. Her husband was eventually convicted of her murder following a trial - but always maintained his innocence. At an inquest into his death at Preston Coroner’s Court today heard that prison staff became concerned about his mental state and put Park on prison suicide watch in July 2008. Around the same time, he had asked his third wife Jenny to send him the Prison and Probation Ombudsman’s report into serial killer GP Dr Harold Shipman’s suicide in Wakefield prison. According to Mrs Park, her husband 'didn’t think it was necessary' to be on the watch but did not discuss with his wife why he wanted the Shipman report. Staff at HMP Garth the opened a second report into the state of his mind when his appeal against his conviction failed in November 2008. The lady in the lake: Carol Park vanished in 1976 but her body was found dumped in Coniston Water in the Lake District more than 10 years later in 1997 . His wife - who married her husband in 1993 - told the inquest: 'He was very concerned about the appeal and I was very worried that if the appeal failed he might take his own life. 'It was the fact that if the appeal failed he would not want to continue living in prison because he could see no future for him to be released.' Mrs Park said this was discussed during their regular telephone calls, but that he 'settled down' again after a few weeks. The inquest heard how Park seemed 'shocked' by the decision and began giving his possessions away to other inmates. But Park told concerned prison officers that he was just 'having a clear out' and was taken off suicide watch again in December 2008. Mrs Park said that her husband was a 'very religious man' and enjoyed visits from a friendly pastor, George Harrison, of the Pendlebury Evangelical Church in Swinton, Manchester, while incarcerated. Mystery: Park was arrested following the discovery by divers of his wife's body in the beauty spot Lake Coniston but was not tried and convicted of her murder until 2005 . Mr Harrison had housed the Parks during his 10-week trial at Manchester Crown Court in 2005. But when Mr Harrison’s visits were abruptly stopped by prison bosses in December 2009, Mrs Park said it seemed like 'the final straw' for her husband. She told the inquest: 'He gained something from those visits that I couldn’t give him. I don’t know what that was. 'He just couldn’t understand it [when the visits were stopped]. His whole demeanour when I saw him was that this was the last straw really. 'It was another thing he had no control over and couldn’t do anything about. 'He seemed much sadder somehow. He was not as interested in anything said to him or going on around him.' The Parks launched another appeal to the Criminal Courts Review Commission, which Mrs Park told the inquest was her husband’s 'only hope'. But he was found dead on January 25, 2010. Evidence: Park's widow and third wife Jenny, pictured left leaving Preston Coroners Court today, told the inquest she became concerned about the mental state of her husband Gordon, pictured together right outside Manchester Crown Court in 2004, after he lost his appeal against his murder conviction in 2008 . Mrs Park said: 'It was a huge shock.' Coroner Dr James Adeley asked her what the significance was of Park choosing his 66th birthday to apparently commit suicide. She replied: 'I think it was so I would not have two days to remember'.Asked by Mr Harrison - who is acting as the family’s advocate - what Park found difficult about prison, Mrs Park replied: 'The regime, the routine, not seeing his family, the lack of freedom, lack of hope.'The inquest is due to last four days and will hear from the Prison and Probation Ombudsman report into Park’s death.Mrs Park was supported in court by Park’s son Jeremy, now 42, from his marriage with Carol. However the family have chosen not to stay for the rest of the inquest and left the court following Mrs Park’s evidence. The retired schoolmaster was accused of bludgeoning his wife Carol to death with an ice axe in July 1976 and dumping her body in the lake near the family home in Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness. Notorious: The murder of 'lady in the lake' Carol Park remained one of Britain's most well-known unsolved murder cases for many years . He claimed he had taken their children on a trip to Blackpool on the day she vanished to live with another man when she was aged 30. Her body had come to rest on an underwater ledge and was found by amateur divers 11 years later. She was found wearing her blue baby doll night-dress, arms bound tightly and with tape over her eyes. Park was arrested and charged with her murder but the case against him was dropped in January 1998 when the Crown Prosecution Service said it did not have enough evidence against him. A second police investigation uncovered fresh evidence by linking him to the killing with the knots meticulously used to tie up the body and a piece of Westmorland green slate used to weigh it down that matched the stone used to build the family home. The 2005 guilty verdict at Manchester Crown Court brought an end to one of Britain’s most notorious unsolved murders. Park was jailed for life to serve a minimum of 15 years. However, Park had always maintained his innocence and wrote letters to the media from jail. His family, including third wife Jenny and his children Jeremy and Rachel have continued campaigned for his conviction to be overturned posthumously. The case became known as ‘Lady in the Lake’ after the Raymond Chandler novel of the same name.","Gordon Park was jailed for life in 2005 for murdering his teacher wife Carol .

'Evil': Donna Wright, 33, was spared a jail sentence for sending vile internet abuse to family of a missing girl . A family targeted by an internet hoaxer posing as their missing daughter told of their outrage yesterday after she was spared jail. Donna Wright, 33, was branded 'pure evil' after sending a string of online messages to the parents of Katrice Lee, who went missing on her second birthday   in 1981. A court heard she gave the family false hope by claiming to be their daughter. But when a DNA test proved she was lying, she began bombarding them with insults. In one of the most hurtful messages, she blamed the Lees for losing their daughter, adding: 'You make me sick.' She also told Katrice's mother, Sharon, 59: 'You silly old bitch, you thought you had seen harassment. You have not seen harassment yet.' Katrice's father Richard, 63, branded her 'sick' and asked why she had not been sent to jail. Mr Lee, of Hartlepool, said: 'I do not believe Donna Wright got her just deserts. I had hoped for a prison sentence. 'It will not be long before she is at it again. She has put my family through purgatory. 'I would ask her to put herself in my shoes just for one day.' Katrice went missing as her mother was buying crisps at a shop near the Army base in Paderborn, Germany, where her father was stationed with the King's Royal Hussars. Believing she was snatched, the couple – who divorced 20 years ago – later set up a Facebook page dedicated to finding her. Their hopes were raised when Wright made contact on Facebook in December 2011 to say she might be Katrice, Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court in County Durham was told. Harassed: Katrice Lee, left, has been missing since she disappeared from a shopping centre in West Germany in 1981. Her father Richard Lee, right, described her as a 'very sad and sick individual' Upset: The sister of missing Katrice Lee, Natasha, said she is 'filled with dread' every time she logs on to Facebook . Compensation: Donna Wright was ordered to pay £400 in compensation to the family of Katrice Lee and told her contact with them 'must stop' But even after the negative DNA test, . Wright continued to send messages, despite being warned by police. She . was eventually arrested last December. Wright claimed her mother had said . that an uncle had 'brought her a little girl because her family did not . want her'. Another message said: 'I was brought over from Germany. Will . you please help me look into this. It's a cover-up.' Most offensively, she told Mrs Lee, of Gosport, Hampshire: 'You lost your daughter over a packet of crisps, you make me sick.' Katrice's sister Natasha, 39, who . helps her parents run the Facebook page, said Wright was 'pure evil'. She added: 'Every day is like a waking nightmare for me. 'Devastated and heartbroken, I grew up not knowing where my sister is. This is even harder to bear because of Donna Wright.' Wright, from Spennymoor, County . Durham, admitted harassment without violence. She received a restraining . order and a suspended 12-week jail sentence, and was told to pay £200 . compensation each to Katrice's mother and sister.

Storm surges as devastating as those caused by Hurricane Katrina could happen 10 times more often if global temperatures rise by just two degrees, new research warns. An estimated 1,836 people lost their lives and millions more were left homeless by the cyclone, the worst to ever hit the U.S., after it submerged New Orleans and other Gulf of Mexico communities in 2005. Much of the devastation was caused by storm surges whipped up by fierce winds, which saw sea levels rise by between 24 and 28 feet along a 20-mile stretch of the Mississippi coast. Devastating: A Red Cross truck sits flooded with other vehicles in front of a hotel just off Interstate 10 in Pascagoula, Mississippi, as Hurricane Katrina battered the area in August 2005 . A 27.8ft surge at Pass Christian, Mississippi was the highest recorded in U.S. history. The new research suggests that even moderate climate change is likely to make such extreme storm surges as much as 10 times more frequent than they are today. Since 1923, there has been a Katrina-magnitude storm surge roughly every 20 years. Researchers calculated that with less than half a degree Celsius of global warming, this frequency would double. A 1C rise produces a three to four-fold rate increase and if temperatures rise by 2C - the 'safe' limit for temperature change set by climate experts - extreme storm surges will become 10 times more common. Submerged: Floodwaters from Hurricane Katrina flow over a levee along Inner Harbor Navigaional Canal near downtown New Orleans. Some 1,836 people were killed and millions more left homeless by the cyclone . Shocking new images revealed by Nasa show the Arctic is becoming lusher and greener as temperatures rise. 'Vegetation growth at Earth's northern latitudes increasingly resembles lusher latitudes to the south' the agency said after releasing a new study based on a 30-year record of land surface and newly improved satellite data sets. The images show how the extreme of the Northern Hemisphere is changing, with previously frozen areas now showing lush green grass and trees growing. Show temperature and vegetation growth at northern latitudes now resemble those found 4 degrees to 6 degrees of latitude farther south as recently as 1982, researchers found. 'This means there will be a Katrina . magnitude storm surge every other year,' said Danish climate scientist . Dr Aslak Grinsted, from the University of Copenhagen, who led the . research. The study compared historical storm surges with a range of different climate model predictions, taking into account natural phenomena such as El Nino, which warms the eastern Pacific and affects global temperature. 'We find that 0.4 degrees Celsius warming of the climate corresponds to a doubling of the frequency of extreme storm surges like the one following Hurricane Katrina,' said Dr Grinsted. 'With the global warming we have had during the 20th century, we have already crossed the threshold where more than half of all ""Katrinas"" are due to global warming. 'If the temperature rises an additional degree, the frequency will increase three to four times and if the global climate becomes two degrees warmer, there will be about 10 times as many extreme storm surges.' He added that under normal conditions sea levels around the world were expected to rise as a result of global warming, making storm surges even more extreme and destructive. Findings were reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Two degrees celsius warming is the 'safe limit' set by climate scientists .

A police officer accused of plotting to cook and eat women has demanded that prosecutors give him the names of 20 other suspected cannibals. Gilberto Valle, who served with the NYPD, insisted he needed to contact the alleged criminals to prepare his defence, because he was accused of being in league with them. Police apparently have 'hundreds of thousands of e-mail and instant-message communications in which Mr Valle and others talked about their violent sexual fantasies.' 'Sick discussions': Gilberto Valle, who served with the NYPD, says he needs to contact others with whom he engaged in perverted online chats to prepare his defence . Hearing: Valle's defence lawyers have pointed out that no women were hurt, although among his named ¿victims¿ are women who the FBI have established did know him . However, prosecutors have so far identified only three of the 20-plus alleged perverts Valle chatted with as potential 'co-conspirators'. This does leave open the possibility that there may be more, according to the Manhattan federal court filing seen by the New York Post. The three are identified in court papers as Michael Vanhise, 'Moody Blues' and 'Ali Khan.' Public defender Julia Gatto wrote: 'Three weeks before trial, the defence needs to firmly know the identity of Mr Valle’s alleged co-conspirators so that it can conduct its pre-trial investigation. 'Indeed, effective trial preparation could uncover facts critical to Mr Valle’s defence in that the individuals with whom Mr Valle was chatting likely will corroborate that they were engaging in fantasy role play with no intention of acting on their fantasies.' Police declined to comment. Gilberto and his estranged wife Kathleen Cooke Mangan, 28. It was Kathleen's discoveries on Valle's computer that led FBI agents to her husband .

Files found on the father of one’s computer included one titled: ‘Abducting and Cooking Victim I: A Blueprint’. It listed materials required including chloroform and rope as well as chronicling the practicalities of fitting a victim into an oven – her legs, he noted, would have to be bent. Valle also expressed a desire to cook one particular victim slowly – ‘tying her onto some form of apparatus’ and trying to ‘keep her alive as long as possible’. In a particularly chilling section of the internet transcripts read out in Manhattan Federal Court during his bail hearing, Valle shared his hunger for ‘girl meat’ on Thanksgiving in an email exchange with an alleged co-conspirator. His defence maintain these were nothing but fantasies and have pointed out that no women were hurt, although among his named ‘victims’ are women whom the FBI have established did indeed know Valle.

HIV has been turned against itself in the laboratory in a breakthrough that could permanently quash the virus that leads to AIDS, say scientists. A researcher in Australia worked out how to modify a protein in the virus, so that it instead provides strong, lasting protection from the infection. 'This is like fighting fire with fire,' David Harrich from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, in Brisbane said. 'If this research continues down its strong path, and bear in mind there are a many hurdles to clear, we’re looking at a cure for AIDS.' HIV budding in human lymphatic tissue. The breakthrough could keep the virus in a latent state in the body . Associate Professor Harrich invented the 'Nullbasic' protein by mutating an existing HIV protein. He said it has shown remarkable abilities to stop the virus replicating in a lab environment. Animal trials are due to start this year. 'I have never seen anything like it. The modified protein works every time,' he said. 'You would still be infected with HIV, it’s not a cure for the virus. But the virus would stay latent, it wouldn’t wake up, so it wouldn’t develop into AIDS. With a treatment like this, you would maintain a healthy immune system.' The successful development of this type of one-off treatment would also have economic implications. HIV patients must take a regime of drugs for the rest of their lives once their immune system is compromised, which can be a significant financial burden. Indeed, a study released by Imperial College London has suggested patients should start taking antiretrovirals as soon as they are diagnosed as this could slow the damage to the immune system. The latest research has been published in the current issue of Human Gene Therapy and marks three decades of work by Harrich. Current anti-retroviral medicines suppress the replication of HIV by blocking the enzymes HIV uses to replicate itself . Associate Professor Harrich has been researching HIV for thirty years, since starting as a research assistant at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the early 1980s when the first cases of HIV/AIDS emerged. 'I’ve come close to giving up in the past. But today I’m so encouraged. I feel very fortunate because not a lot of scientists are able to stay in the same game long enough to see these sorts of developments. It involves perseverance, dedication and, of course, sustained research funding.' Deborah Jack, Chief Executive of the National AIDS Trust: ""The Australian study is very interesting and we'll definitely be monitoring how the research continues. 'It's great that these sorts of studies are getting the funding and support they need and that we appear to be getting closer to understanding how HIV works, and what might in future become a cure. 'This is one of a number of promising avenues in cure research, all of which need as appropriate continued discussion, funding and support."" There are an estimated 32.2million HIV-infected people worldwide. The Terrence Higgins Trust estimates that 100,000 live in the UK, with around a quarter unaware they have the infection.","Technique modifies a protein in the virus to that is provides protection from infection .

The Government is to reduce or stop disability allowance for hundreds of thousands of claimants in a bid to end unchecked ‘welfare for life’. The clampdown comes as new figures suggest that seven in ten of those claiming the benefit go through the system without proper checks. Ministers intend to reassess an initial 560,000 claimants, and expect that 330,000 – nearly 60 per cent – will get no award or a reduced sum after the checks. There are currently 3.2million adults claiming disability living allowance (DLA), costing Britain £13.2billion a year – equivalent to the entire budget for the Department for Transport. The number of claimants has more than trebled since the benefit was created in 1992. Disability minister Esther McVey said without reform, one in every 17 adults would be claiming DLA by 2018. The Tory minister said the vast majority of claimants – 71 per cent – get the benefit ‘for life’, often having filled in an initial claim form about their capability themselves. She added that about a third of people with a disability had a change in a condition in a year – some for the worse, but many for the better. This suggests that in many cases claimants may no longer need the full benefit or any allowance at all. The first 560,000 claimants will be reassessed by October 2015. The group consists of those who report a change in circumstance or who have been given a time-limited award that comes to an end. In a concession to critics, the Government will slow down the timetable for checks on the remaining claimants, which will begin in 2015. It is not clear that the same proportion  will see benefits reduced in the second stage as in the first. An independent review of the first stage of reform will be conducted in 2014. The Government has already identified £630million in overpayments and £190million in underpayments, highlighting the turmoil in the welfare system. Miss McVey said: ‘It has been considered a . static benefit, not a dynamic one. But there will be people getting . better thanks to medical advances or who overcome an impairment. So we . need new and more regular assessments. Condemning: David Cameron called Labour the party of 'unlimited welfare' as he faced criticism over the benefits clampdown at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday . ‘DLA is an outdated benefit introduced over 20 years ago. ‘At the moment the vast majority of people get the benefit for life without systematic checks to see if their condition has changed.’ The Coalition is replacing DLA with a new benefit, called the personal independence payment. It will be designed to target more generous support towards ‘those who need it most’. The new system will involve a medical expert assessing a claim in a face-to-face appointment, and regular later checks. Last night, charities voiced a chorus of protest at plans to slash the disability benefit bill. A poll by campaign group Disability Alliance found that 9 per cent of survey respondents said losing the disability living allowance ‘may make life not worth living’. The group has also protested that the . Government had identified cuts in spending before consulting on which . elements of benefits needed to be reformed. The . clampdown on disability benefit emerged as the Conservatives and Labour . traded increasingly bitter blows over efforts to cut the vast welfare . budget. Challenge: Labour Leader Ed Miliband's claim that the new benefits system will lower-income families in work was disputed by David Cameron . At Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, David Cameron condemned Labour as the party of ‘unlimited welfare’. Ed Miliband made clear Labour will oppose Government plans to cap most out-of-work benefits and tax credits to a below-inflation 1 per cent increase for the next three years. Labour claims that the squeeze will hit lower income families who are in work but in receipt of tax credits as well as the unemployed, but the Prime Minister insisted that such concern is misplaced. Working families would be more than compensated by other measures, most notably, a record increase in the basic rate income tax threshold to £9,440, Mr Cameron said. Officials say the average working family would be £125 a year better off next year once the income tax break, the tax credit squeeze and the cancellation of a 3p rise in fuel duty are taken into account. Savings from the welfare cap are so significant that it would take a 1p rise income tax to plug the gap. Mr Miliband accused the Government of seeking to ‘divide and rule’, by portraying benefit claimants as ‘scroungers’.","New figures show 71 per cent of claimants do not go through proper checks .

Nicolas Maduro was sworn in Friday as Venezuela's acting president, using the occasion to launch blistering attacks on the U.S. as well as the political opposition, which objected that the ceremony violated the country's constitution. Late President Hugo Chavez designated Maduro as his successor before he died Tuesday of cancer. Maduro had been Chavez's vice president. The country's 1999 constitution says the National Assembly speaker becomes interim president in the event of a president-elect's death or inability to be sworn in. The constitution also says a presidential election should be called within 30 days. New president: Nicolas Maduro was sworn in Friday as Venezuela's acting president, using the occasion to launch blistering attacks on the U.S. Maduro has been picked as the presidential candidate of Chavez's socialist party. Opposition leader Angel Medina said earlier Friday that the opposition would boycott the swearing-in ceremony, and the vast majority of opposition legislators did not attend. Former U.S. presidential candidate, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, attended the ceremony as did Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa. Stray fireworks exploded above the capital of Caracas as soon as Maduro was sworn in as president. Both Maduro and National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello pledged to follow Chavez's example and push his socialist-inspired agenda. 'I swear by the most absolute loyalty to comrade Hugo Chavez that we will fulfill and see that it's fulfilled the constitution ... with the iron fist of a people ready to be free,' Maduro said. He also echoed accusations he made shortly before Chavez's death that the U.S. had caused the leader's fatal cancer. On Friday night, he referred to 'this illness very strange for the speed of its growth and for other scientific reasons that will be known in their moment.'

Maduro lays a replica of Simon Bolivar's sword on the coffin of Venezuela's late President Hugo Chavez . Maduro and National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello pledged to follow Chavez's example and push his socialist-inspired agenda . He later duplicated Chavez's penchant for slamming 'the empire,' his term for the United States. 'We tell them: Sooner than later, the imperialist elites who govern the United States will have to learn to live with absolute respect with the insurrectional people of the ... Latin and Caribbean America,' he said. Maduro also claimed the allegiance of Venezuela's army, calling it 'the armed forces of Chavez' as he pumped his fist in the air, a gesture that was reciprocated by the defense minister watching from the gallery. Critics have voiced increasing concern about the overt support the military has shown to the ruling party since Chavez's death, despite a ban on the army's participation in politics. He later named Science and Technology Minister Jorge Arreaza, Chavez's son-in-law, as his vice president. Arreaza had frequently been at the side of the dying president in his final weeks, sometimes providing updates about his health. Shortly before the swearing-in, opposition leader Henrique Capriles said Maduro had used Chavez's funeral earlier in the day to campaign for the presidency. Capriles is widely expected to run against Maduro in the coming vote. A former bus driver and union leader, Maduro had served as Chavez's foreign minister and was often seen on television accompanying the president during cancer treatments in Cuba. Chavez named Maduro his No. 2 after winning his third re-election in October. Since the death, Maduro was seen Wednesday leading a massive funeral cortege through the streets of Caracas as well as welcoming foreign dignitaries and delivering the eulogy at Friday's funeral.","Nicolas Maduro was sworn in Friday as Venezuela's acting president .

Players were invited to experience the games tutorial mode and then given free reign with an hour's maximum gameplay. If you enjoyed the beta as much as we did, an hour wasn’t nearly enough time. SimCity have been generous with their gameplay videos and screenshots so gamers have known what to expect when they sank their teeth into this city-building monster. The tutorial takes you through the basics of gameplay and how to set the foundations for your city including how to manage your power, water, waste and sewage systems – vital attributes if your city is going to flourish. The game is powered by the GlassBox engine and is visually beautiful. Just by using the mouse, players can tilt the camera angle, zoom in and see ‘Sims’ going about their business and zoom out to admire the growth of the city. Overlay maps allow players to see better areas to place water towers, areas of high crime or sewage. These feedback views are a great way for city-builders to plan and react to the natural growth of their city. Whilst some aspects of the game were locked in this build, most players will agree that more than enough fun could be had in the hour given. Plus, the addition of curved roads is a much demanded aspect missing from previous games. Release is scheduled for March 5. NOW WATCH SIMCITY'S GLASSBOX ENGINE IN ACTION: .

The former head of transportation . security says a new policy that allows small knives on commercial planes . doesn't go far enough, and should include weapons such as 'battle axes' and 'machetes.' Kip Hawley, the former chief of the . Transportation Security Administration, said anything that wouldn't be . able to harm an aircraft's functionality should be allowed on board. 'In retrospect, I should have done . the same thing,' Hawley told CNN of the rule, which has caused widespread . confusion and outrage, especially among the families of . victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kip Hawley, the former chief of TSA, says a new policy that allows small knives on commercial planes doesn't go far enough, and should include weapons such as 'battle axes' and 'machetes' New rules: Flight attendants are balking at the new changes that will lift a number of prohibited items and allow travelers to carry on small knives on board . Remaining restrictions: TSA officials hope that by keeping some banned it will instill less fear in flyers . 'They ought to let everything on that . is sharp and pointy,' Hawley said. 'Battle axes, machetes ... bring . anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able . to commit an act of violence, you will not be able to take over the . plane. It is as simple as that.' Hawley added, 'So my position would . be, bravo on the 2.6 inch knife. But why not take it all the way and . then really clean up the checkpoint where officers are focusing on bombs . and toxins, which are things that can destroy an airplane. And it would . smooth the process, cost less money, and be better security.' The TSA's announcement of the new policy has upset many families who lost loved ones in the 9/11 terror attacks. 'I'm really horrified and I would say . the majority of 9/11 family members are really shocked by it,' said . Sally Regenhard, the mother of firefighter Christian Regenhard who died . trying to save people in the World Trade Center. The TSA said effective April 25, it . would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in . length and less than 1/2 inch wide. Explaining why axes and machetes . wouldn't do harm on an airplane, Hawley said, 'What are you going to do . when you get on board with a battle ax? Are you pull out your battle ax . and say, ""I'm taking over the airplane?"" You may be able to cut one or . two people, but pretty soon you would be down in the aisle and the . battle ax would be used on you.' Tragic: Sally Regenhard stand at a September 11 Memorial event with a picture of her firefighter son Christian. She is one of the many family members of victims who is outraged at the new TSA changes . He added, 'You can commit acts of violence on an aircraft with what is allowed now. With a Coke can, a key, a ruler, and some duct tape, you can make a 12-inch razor-sharp sword. And every eighth-grader would be able to do that.' Ms Regenhard told MailOnline about a recent flight she took to Los Angeles where the security screener stopped her because she had a small container of yogurt onto a flight. 'Yogurt's more dangerous than a pen knife and a golf club!' she said. 'I am vehemently against anyone bringing a pen knife. I don't think there is another 9/11 family who doesn't get on a plane with a lot of trepidation and fear. 'I always think of 9/11. I always think ""Is there someone on here who is going to be here who is going to be a terrorist?""' Another relative, Debra Burlingame, says small pocketknives can be just as lethal as the box cutters that are still banned. Ms Burlingame's brother was the pilot of the hijacked plane that crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. The hijackers wielded box cutters. The families of victims are not the only ones who are upset: the former colleagues of victims are as well. Specific: The TSA says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures . Exemptions: Only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all . The Association of Professional . Flight attendants 'categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of . any kind in the cabin,' and they don't understand why 'such a momentous . decision' was made without any consultation. As . for some of the larger items that they will now allow, like the sports . equipment, increases 'the potential for passengers getting hit with . these items during boarding and deplaning. It's a recipe for disaster,' said the APFA representative. 'This is part of an overall Risk-Based . Security approach, which allows Transportation Security officers to . better focus their efforts on finding higher-threat items such as . explosives,' he said. Hawley said he understands and respects their opposition, 'but from a security strategy point of view this is absolutely the right decision.' 'The air marshals and the flight attendants have legitimate concerns, certainly, for their own safety, but the threat of taking over a plane with a small, sharp instrument is zero,' Hawley said. 'You cannot necessarily prevent violence on an airplane, but that is not the TSA's mission. TSA's mission is to prevent a successful, catastrophic terrorist attack, and you cannot get a successful, catastrophic terrorist attack with a small knife or a Wiffle ball bat.' Travelers will now be allowed to bring . golf clubs, ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since . aviation officials have announced significant security changes. Other items that will be allowed on . board again as part of a passenger's carry-on luggage include billiard . cues, ski poles, hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks. Items that had been prohibited like razors, box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board. The restrictions about liquids are . still in place as well, meaning that anything under 3-ounces must be . declared at the security checkpoint. Loosening the reins: TSA officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on April 25 . No longer a threat? Billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now . The . Flight Attendants Union Coalition, which represents nearly 90,000 flight . attendants from carriers across the country, called the decision a . 'poor and shortsighted decision' by the TSA. 'As the last line of defense in the cabin . and key aviation partners, we believe that these proposed changes will . further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers . we work so hard to keep safe and secure,' the coalition said in a . statement. TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the . decision was made to bring U.S. regulations more in line with . International Civil Aviation Organization standards and would also help . provide a better experience for travelers. Castelveter said the TSA has implemented a . number of safety measures including reinforced cockpit doors, allowing . some pilots to be armed and federal air marshals on board airplanes.

Initially set 25 years after the events of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate follows the story of Gabriel Belmont's ancestors, and is being released exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS. Trevor Belmont, a knight of the Brotherhood of Light, sets out to avenge the death of his mother, at the hands of his own father, who has now returned from years of exile to take up residence in a mysterious castle. Gabriel Belmont is now a powerful vampire called Dracula after being corrupted by an ancient evil called The Forgotten One. He's declared war upon the Brotherhood, setting the scene for a showdown between father and son. Brother in arms: Concept art showing how Trevor will look in the final game . We caught up with Dave Cox, producer of the Lords of Shadow saga, and quizzed him about what fans can expect in Mirror of Fate. 1. Tell us about the game. How is the story told? Cox: 'The plot centres around the blood feud with the Belmont's but this time from Dracula's perspective. The story is told backwards like Chris Nolan's Memento and it's not until the very end  of the game that everything becomes clear. 'We wanted to show that the fate of each character and the choices they make have a direct impact on those closest to them. I think once all is said and done players will have some sympathy with our villain.' 2. The original was a beautiful-looking game, although there were frequent gripes with drops in framerate. What improvements can we expect to see in this version? Cox: 'This game is very much a combination of the old and the new.It has the modern sensibility of he first game but harks back to the classics in a more cohesive way. 'We want to screw around with player perception, on the surface this looks like a classic side scrolling Castlevania game but look deeper and you will see a very combat focused game that utilises the stereoscopic 3D effects to the max. 'Often we put the camera into the game world and in several places the game is shown as a third person perspective. It's this constant melding of old and new that will surprise players.' 3. Does gameplay stay true to the very first games, or does it follow in Lords of Shadow's footsteps? Cox: 'This is very much a sequel to Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and in that respect gameplay is consistent with that game. 'It's much more about combat which is deep and intense like the original. Of course, we have incorporated some of the features of the classics and exploration plays a much big role this time. 'In some ways we see this as a spiritual successor to Castlevania 3: Dracula's Curse with its multiple characters and branching pathways.' 4. Are there any plans to bring Lords of Shadow to the Wii U? Cox: 'This game is only planned for 3DS and we have no plans to bring to Wii U.' 5. How long will the game last? Cox: 'Average playthroughs are around 16 hours but you won't have collected or seen everything the game has to offer. Usually this would take around 20 hours.' 6. What inspired you when designing the levels / beasts? Cox: 'It's really the classic games from the NES and SNES era in particular the original Castlevania and Dracula's Curse. We often check those designs when redesigning our world. 'We all grew up on those early classics and it's those games that have inspired us in redefining the Castlevania universe.'

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:00 EST, 6 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:00 EST, 6 March 2013 . U.S. cardinals have been banned from talking about the Catholic church's internal deliberations ahead of the conclave to elect the next pope. Cardinals attending closed-door discussions imposed a media blackout Wednesday, forcing the cancellation of the popular daily press briefings by U.S. cardinals. The official reason for the blackout was that some details of the secret discussions about the problems in the church appeared in the Italian newspaper La Stampa. Media blackout: U.S. cardinals have been banned from talking about the Catholic church's internal deliberations ahead of the conclave to elect the next pope . But speculation mounted that the underlying aim of the blackout was to silence the Americans, who have been vocal in their calls for disclosure about allegations of corruption and dysfunction in the Holy See's governance before they enter the conclave to elect a successor to Benedict XVI. As a result, the conflict appears to be a microcosm of the likely battle lines heading into the election: American and German cardinals have indicated they want a pope who will impose some order on the Vatican's inner workings, while the Vatican-based cardinals are defending their record and seeking to end the discussion. One Italian cardinal said the Curia, or the Vatican bureaucracy, had been sorely maligned and that he could 'only say good things about it.' 'In the Curia, the pope has a docile tool that does exactly what he wants and tries to help him in the best of ways,' Italian media quoted Cardinal Giovanni Lajolo, the retired administrator of the Vatican City State as saying during a book launch Tuesday. 'Of course it can always be improved.' That picture is at odds with evidence of turf battles, Machiavellian machinations and allegations of corruption and cronyism that were exposed last year when private papal documents were leaked to an Italian journalist. The documents paint a portrait of an utterly dysfunctional, ungovernable Italian bureaucracy. Silenced: Cardinal Roger Mahony of the U.S. attends a prayer at Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. The blackout has forced U.S. cardinals to cancel their popular daily press briefings . The Vatican denied it had exerted any pressure on the American cardinals to keep quiet and cancel their briefings. But the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, made clear that the Holy See considered this week's pre-conclave meetings to be secret and part of a solemn process to choose a pope, suggesting that he didn't necessarily appreciate the Americans' candor. 'The College (of Cardinals) as a whole has decided to maintain a line of an increasing degree of reserve,' he said. The debate played out as the Vatican awaited the arrival of the last voting-age cardinal: Vietnamese Cardinal Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man, who was expected in Rome on Thursday. With his arrival, the College of Cardinals was expected to be able to set a date for the start of the conclave, where 115 men will select the next pontiff. The spokeswoman for the U.S. cardinals, Sister Mary Ann Walsh, said Wednesday's briefing and all cardinal interviews were canceled after other cardinals expressed concern about the content of articles in Italian daily La Stampa, which over the past several days reported details of comments individual cardinals made in the closed-door meetings. Denial: The Vatican denied it had exerted any pressure on the American cardinals to keep quiet and cancel their briefings . La Stampa reported Wednesday, for example, that the head of the Vatican's legal office had told the cardinals of the need for improved coordination among the various Vatican offices and better communication between the Holy See and local dioceses. None of those details came from the American briefing, where the U.S. cardinals took pains to stress the secrecy of the actual proceedings. 'I don't think anyone was angry at the Americans. They were angry at La Stampa,' Walsh told The Associated Press. 'In true old-style Catholic school teacher fashion, someone talks and everybody stays after school,' Walsh said. She added that the Americans had been assured that the Vatican was pleased with their briefings. Perhaps. But Lombardi's palpable irritation suggested otherwise. Italian media reported that Vatican-based cardinals wanted the election to take place quickly and speculated that Italian cardinals in particular were displeased with the Americans for making clear they were requesting more information about the Vatican's internal governance problems. The implication was the Rome-based cardinals didn't want the Vatican's dirty laundry aired out. Conflict: American and German cardinals have said they want a pope who will impose order on the Vatican's inner workings, while the Vatican-based cardinals are defending their record . Cardinals Daniel DiNardo of Texas and Sean O'Malley of Boston said in Tuesday's briefing that they favored taking a longer time for pre-conclave discussions to gather more information. 'We need to give it the time that's necessary,' O'Malley told the packed press conference at the North American College, the U.S. seminary up the hill from the Vatican. 'I believe the feeling of the cardinals is that we want to have enough time in the general congregations so that when we go to the conclave itself it's a time of decision.' Drawing laughs, O'Malley added: 'And it is hard to get a bad meal in Rome.' German Cardinal Walter Kasper also called for more time. 'Among the cardinals, we barely know one another,' he told La Repubblica newspaper. 'There's no hurry.' Italian newspapers and international media, including The Associated Press, have reported on the Americans' unique briefings and how they contrasted with the near-silence from other cardinals and Lombardi's comparatively sedate Vatican briefings. During Tuesday's briefing, DiNardo and O'Malley held a lively and informative 30-minute chat with some 100 reporters and two dozen television crews from around the globe. They revealed no details of their closed-door discussions. But they nevertheless provided journalists with insight about the process from two people actually involved. 'We're trying to help people have a greater understanding of what the process is and the procedures and background information,' O'Malley told reporters. 'Right now that's about all we can share with you but we're happy to try to do it.'","Cardinals imposed media blackout Wednesday, forcing cancellation of American cardinals' popular daily press briefings .

Winning an Emmy can add nearly three years to a actor's life thanks to the opportunities it gives them to improve their careers, a new study claims. However the stress of being U.S. president, on the other hand, shortens the lives of those who wriggle so far up the greasy pole of politics by as many as five years. Researchers from Columbia University, New York, investigated life's winners and losers to see how success could be linked to mortality. Difficult job: A new study claims that the stresses associated with being president, like Barack Obama, can shorten a person's life by as many as five years . Studies have long linked high socio-economic status with better health, but what has remained unclear is whether this is more to do with access to resources or the glow of higher social status relative to others. Scholars call the latter 'relative deprivation.' A team led by Dr Bruce Link studied Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, Emmy Award winners, and former Presidents and Vice Presidents, comparing each to nominated losers in the same competition or election. They found no consistent advantages for winners. Indeed, in some cases such as winning the presidential election, the victory robbed the winner of several years. Dr Link and his associates found the following effects of winning versus losing in the three groups: . 'The relative deprivation theory would predict that losers would consistently be at a disadvantage for health and longevity compared to winners, but this is not what we see,' said Dr Link, a professor of Sociomedical Sciences. A more likely explanation, he notes, is that the advantages and disadvantages of winning depend on the mix of opportunities and stresses that they bring. Homeland actor Damian Lewis brandishes his Emmy in September last year: Winning an Emmy can add nearly three years to a actor's life thanks to the opportunities it gives them to improve their careers, the study claims . Winning an Emmy often leads to significant career opportunities that might not have been otherwise available. The paper quotes actor John Larroquette saying, 'There's no doubt that having an Emmy precedes you through the door.' On the other hand, Baseball Hall of Fame induction occurs after playing careers are over and therefore has little bearing on career opportunities and earnings. As for presidential and vice presidential candidates, life circumstances do change for members of this elite club, but winning also brings significant risks: assassination threats and extreme stress from two of the world's most demanding jobs. The 15 men who led the U.S. during the 20th century but died by the year 2008 lived an average of 1.9 years less than the average American male of the same age. 'Our findings provide an important correction to an overemphasis on relative deprivation as an explanation of health inequalities,' said Dr Link. 'Relative deprivation likely plays some role in health inequalities, but it is not as important as the life circumstances and opportunities that result from one's socioeconomic position.' Findings are published online in the American Sociological Review and will appear in the April 2013 print edition.","Researchers investigated how success was linked to mortality .
Previous studies have linked high socio-economic status with longer life .
Winning an Emmy helps actors to have better, more successful careers .
However, being President comes with stress that takes a toll .
Emmy-winning actors enjoyed 2.7 more years of life than nominees who did not snag the trophy. Though Emmy-winning screenwriters were, mysteriously, at a three-year disadvantage.
Baseball Hall-of-Famers enjoyed no advantage in longevity over non-inducted nominees.
Presidents and Vice Presidents lose, on average, 5.3 years from their lives compared to the candidates they bested. While some of this is due to the impact of assassination, the disadvantage persists even when assassination is taken out of the equation."

Japan has become the first country in the world to succeed in extracting methane gas from a previously untapped off-shore fossil fuel resource that has been dubbed 'fire ice'. Methane hydrate, a sherbet-like substance buried beneath continental shelves around the world, has been tipped by energy experts to be the next major energy resource. Consisting of methane trapped in ice, it was previously believed to only exist in the outer reaches of the solar system - but now scientists are saying it could be 'the new shale gas'. Fire ice: Balls of methane hydrate are set . alight as part of a demonstration. Japanese scientists have become the first to work out how to extract pure gas . from the substance found under the continental shelves . State-run Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp (JOGMEC) said the gas was tapped from deposits of methane hydrate near the country's central coast. Japan, which imports nearly all of its energy needs, has since 2001 invested several hundred million pounds in developing technology to tap methane hydrate reserves off its coast. Japan is the world's top importer of liquefied natural gas and the lure of domestic gas resources has become greater since the Fukushima nuclear crisis two years ago triggered a shake-up of the country's energy sector. Japan's trade ministry said the production tests will continue for about two weeks, followed by analysis on how much gas was produced. It is hoped that they can achieve commercial production within six years. 'The new shale gas': An aerial view shows deep-sea drilling vessel ""Chikyu"" in the Pacific, off Aichi Prefecture, central Japan, as it hunts for methane hydrate reserves to exploit . Gas flames expelled from a burner on the Chikyu: Methane hydrate, a sherbet-like substance buried beneath continental shelves around the world, has been tipped by energy experts to be the next major energy resource . Methane is a major component of . natural gas and governments including Canada, the U.S., Norway and China . are also looking at exploiting hydrate deposits as an alternative . source of energy. In . February last year UK government ministers and experts suggested that . massive quantities methane hydrate could also be locked beneath the . coast of western Shetland. Energy . Minister Charles Hendry said at the time that the government believes . it is ‘possible’ that the substance is buried in Scottish waters. ‘The presence of methane hydrates in deep waters west of Shetland is possible, but has not been established,' he said. 'In . the absence of any commercial technology for exploiting such resources, . no estimate of reserves can be made at the present time.’ That could be about to change thanks . to the new method developed by Japanese scientists to extract gas from . methane hydrate reserves off their country's coast. Methane hydrate is formed within marine sediments or beneath permafrost where chemical reactions or microbes break down organic matter to produce gas which then freezes under high pressure . Distribution of known and suspected methane hydrate accumulations around the globe: It has been tipped by energy experts to be the world's next major energy resource . Methane hydrate has long been regarded by oil and gas companies as a nuisance, because it can block marine drilling rigs. The substance is formed within marine sediments where the gas is generated by chemical reactions or by microbes breaking down organic matter. The gas then works its way up to the sea bed where sediments tend to be much cooler. The cooling allows the methane molecules to form weak chemical bonds with the surrounding water molecules, producing solid methane hydrate. However, such bonds also require high pressure - so methane hydrate forms only in deep water. Engineers used depressurisation to turn methane hydrate to methane gas, a process thought by the government to be more effective than using the hot water circulation method the country had tested successfully in 2002. In 2008, JOGMEC successfully demonstrated for the first time a nearly six-day continuous period of production of methane gas from hydrate reserves held deep in permafrost in Canada, using the depressurisation method. Methane hydrate, is formed from a mixture of methane and water under certain pressure and conditions. A Japanese study has estimated the existence of at least 40trillion cubic feet (1.1 trillion cubic metres) of methane hydrates in the eastern Nankai Trough off the country's Pacific coast . That's estimate to equal about 11 years of Japanese gas consumption. Japan's LNG imports hit a record 87.3million tonnes last year after Japan shut down most of its nuclear power plants following the Fukushima nuclear disaster two years ago.","Methane hydrate has been tipped as the next major energy resource .

Heartless: Christine Stevens posed as a counsellor to take money from a grief-stricken mother who had suffered two miscarriages . A conwoman posing as a counsellor took money from a vulnerable mother who was grieving over two miscarriages. Cold-hearted Christine Stevens, 47, advertised herself on Facebook and duped vulnerable Lisa Williams, 39, into paying £185 for nine counselling sessions. A court heard she claimed to be head of a council's therapeutic services and even used the authority's logo on emails and invoices. She also put the initials of the . British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) on her . correspondence to imply she was an accredited member of the body.

'This was a lady going for help and believing she would pay for a service and would receive one. She gave out confidential information which has caused her substantial anxiety.'

Stevens for a few sessions before asking for her office number and the name of her manager . to make a complaint. Yesterday South Cheshire Magistrates Court was told that Stevens decided to end the sessions and, during that time, Mrs Williams had asked for contact details for her manager at Cheshire East Council – the authority Stevens claimed she worked for. Mrs Williams said she had been unhappy over the way the counselling was going and wanted to make a complaint to the authority. But it was not until she underwent further treatment with another counsellor that she found the confidence to follow up her complaint with the authority. Sentence: Stevens was ordered to repay the cash and carry out 120 hours of unpaid work at South Cheshire Magistrates' Court (pictured) After the council confirmed Stevens . was not an employee, Mrs Williams -  who lost her first baby last . January at six weeks and her second child at 12 weeks in May last year - . got in contact with the police who later made an arrest. She said: 'I had undergone some . hypnotherapy. People think it is all about having a clock waved infront . of you but it is nothing like that. 'It is about unlocking your . subconscious.

He said: 'She is adamant that when she spoke to Lisa she said she was a . private counsellor but certain e-mails were sent that would give her . the impression she was working for the council. 'Lisa was her first client. I don't think my client set out to deceive anyone.' Stevens was ordered to repay the money and carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.

Most young couples could only dream of buying a luxury four-bedroom apartment in the center of Manhattan. But Chelsea Clinton, 33, and husband Marc Mezvinsky, 35, are about to swap their $4 million pad for a huge new $10.5 million one nearby. The former first daughter and Mr Mezvinksy - who married in 2010 - are believed to have spotted the 5,000 sq ft property while out walking in the area. Couple: Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky, seen here last November, have bought a luxury $10.5 million penthouse in Manhattan . The apartment is located in The Whitman building next to Madison Square Park, one of the most desirable corners of Manhattan's Flatiron District. They signed a contract for the property, which has stunning views of the park, last month, according to the New York Post. Her father, former US President Bill Clinton and mother - ex-Secretary of State Hillary . Rodham Clinton - are understood to have run their eyes over the couple's home during a visit last week. Her famous parents even agreed to pose for photographs with tradesmen who were carrying out work there, the Post reports. The building, which is being marketed by Douglas Elliman Real Estate, has one apartment on each floor and boasts various security features, including a key operated lift. Luxury: Overlooking Madison Square Park the couple's new home is beautifully finished and boasts state-of-the-art appliances . Beauty: The apartment features high ceilings and elegantly decorated rooms. Built in the new-Georgian style in 1924, the property has been completely renovated . Comfort: The building has been fitted with a top-of-the-range kitchen complete with the latest high quality appliances . Space: There is plenty of room for the couple's toothbrushes in the apartment's huge bathroom, which is fitted out in Italian marble . Ms Clinton and Mr Mezvinsky's level has four bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, a home office and a den. It also has a 252 sq ft planting terrace and a private storage unit is included with the property. The five-story building also boasts 'top-of-the-line' amenities, including a full time doorman, residents' only gym and a refrigerated package room. The couple's apartment has a massive living area with timber floors and is flooded with natural light thanks to floor to ceiling windows. The property's kitchen would be any amateur cook's dream, with a glass splash-back, a large marble worktop and state-of-the-art appliances. The spacious bedrooms in decadent New York home are equally doused in natural light with large windows overlooking the street. And the bathrooms, covered in grey marble tiles, are roomy and ultra modern. Ms Clinton married Mr Mezvinsky in Rhinebeck, . New York at a ceremony attended by many of America's most powerful . figures. She was first reported to be in a relationship with Mr Mezvinsky in 2005, and became engaged to him over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009. The couple's current flat on Fifth Avenue is far from shabby either - boasting three bedrooms, two bathrooms as well as a gym and doorman. The 1,922 sq ft condo is in the Grand Madison - a building that has been dubbed 'the most elegant and historical building downtown.' They will presumably sell the $4 million home, which boasts 'unforgettable views' over downtown Manhattan including Madison Square Park, the Flatiron Building and the Clock Tower - an extraordinary domed white marble building on 25th Street at Madison. According to a Douglas Ellisman listing, the couple's 'starter pad' has a powder room, an open chef's kitchen with beautiful Bluestone countertops, oak floors, Italian marble bathrooms, huge windows, 10' ceilings and scores of luxury finishes. But their already hefty mortgage payments - around $18,460 a month if they paid a 20 per cent downpayment - are set to skyrocket. Assuming Ms Clinton and Mr Mezvinsky put down a $2.1 million deposit on the their new $10.5 million home, their monthly mortgage bill will be in the region of $52,000 and closer to $60,000 if the couple also handed over a 10 per cent downpayment. Position: The apartment block is in East 26th Street, one of New York's most exclusive addresses, and boasts views over Madison Square Park . Connections: The couple pose with Ms Clinton's parents, Bill Clinton and Hilary Rodham Clinton at their wedding in 2010 .","Couple spotted four-bedroom apartment while out walking in Manhattan .

Falkland Islanders are preparing to go to the polls to decide their future - as Argentina steps up its sovereignty claims to the disputed territory. It is thirty-one years since Britain and Argentina went to war over the Falklands, and tensions between London and Buenos Aires are running high. That has only served to strengthen patriotic feeling among the 2,500 islanders - who are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of remaining a British overseas territory in Sunday's referendum. Momentus: Falkland Islanders go to the polls on Sunday to decide whether to remain a British overseas territory . Just 1,649 Falklands-born and long-term residents are registered to vote in the two-day referendum - with a near-unanimous 'yes' vote expected, prompting Argentina to dismiss it as a publicity stunt. Bookmaker Ladbrokes described the result as 'the biggest certainty in political betting history' and said no one had placed a bet on a 'no' vote. But a high turnout is expected as islanders embrace the ballot as an opportunity to make their voices heard. 'People feel strongly about this. It's our chance to make a unified stand on something that affects us deeply,' said Kerri Jamieson, a Falklands-born small business owner who has been selling commemorative referendum T-shirts.

'For the Argentines, it's just an academic exercise, but for us, it affects us enormously,' Ms Jamieson said.","Islanders to vote on remaining British overseas territory on Sunday .

Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has home the first close-up image of the massive asteroid Vesta after a four-year, 1.7billion-mile journey to get there. The robot surveyor is preparing to begin a study of a surface that may date to the earliest era of the solar system. Its entry into orbit on Saturday morning occurred while the spacecraft's antenna was pointed away from Earth, so mission controllers had to wait for Dawn to re-establish contact to confirm its success. Craters visible: The Dawn spacecraft has sent back the first close-up image of the massive asteroid Vesta after a four-year, 1.7billion-mile journey to get there . The capture was estimated to have occurred at at 6am GMT on Saturday, when Dawn was 9,900miles from Vesta and 117million miles from Earth in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, said Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Christopher Russell, from the University of California, Los Angeles and the mission's lead scientist, said: 'We are beginning the study of arguably the oldest extant primordial surface in the solar system.' Nasa said that after the orbital capture, Dawn sent an initial close-up image taken for navigation purposes. Before the Dawn mission, images of Vesta were obtained by ground and space-based telescopes but did not show much surface detail. Distant journey: An artist's impression of the ion-drive propelled space probe Dawn arriving in the asteroid belt .

Vesta's gravitational pull on Dawn will be measured to more accurately determine the asteroid's mass. The spacecraft will eventually get as close as 110miles from the surface. Smash and grab: The view of Vesta from Dawn a month ago, showing the asteroid's lop-sided appearance.

If you like to drive fast you may want to avoid a village in Ohio where more than 6,000 drivers are caught speeding each month. Nearly $1.5 million worth of fines have been issued to motorists since two traffic cameras were installed in Elmwood Place, near Cincinnati, last September. But a judge ruled yesterday that the devices, which issue 6,600 fines a month - at $105 each - violated drivers' constitutional rights. Complaints: Two speed cameras installed in Elmwood Place, Ohio, (pictured) have been issuing fines at a rate of 6,600 a month, or three times the number of people who live in the village . Ruling: Judge Robert Ruehlman has ruled that the fines violate the constitutional rights of drivers who he said are unable to effectively appeal against them . Village officials first approved the speed cameras last July. The firm controlling the cameras gets 40 per cent of the revenue, while the rest goes to the village. But opponents of the cameras - which issue 'civil penalties' and do not add points to driver's licences - said they were just a money making scheme, and launched a legal challenge against them. And their campaign appears to have paid off, after a judge ruled yesterday that the devices 'violate drivers' rights under the state constitution.' Hamilton County Judge Robert Ruehlman's . said the cameras violated 'due . process guarantees' under the Ohio Constitution, Fox News reports. Victory: Attorney Mike Allen - who represented opponents in their legal fight against the fines - said the ruling is the first of its kind in the US . He said hearings held for drivers to contest the fines, are 'nothing more than a sham' as they would effectively be arguing against a written report 'produced by the company that owns the speed monitoring unit.' Attorney Mike Allen, . whose firm brought the case, said this is the first time such a ruling has been made on speed cameras in the US. Up to 18,000 vehicles a . day pass through the village, police said. The cameras' supporters claimed they are effective helping cut speeding in the area. Local police chief William Peskin said last year that the cameras have been installed in the interests of public safety. A spokesman for Optotraffic, the firm which owns and operates the speed cameras, told ABC News in January that the devices are an 'efficient and accurate way to control speed.'","Nearly $1.5m worth of fines handed out to drivers since cameras installed .

Samantha Puleston always felt her husband Andy lived in his own world. Even during the most emotionally charged moments of their relationship, he could appear oddly detached and preoccupied with irrelevant practical details. 'Our daughter Sophie is 18 weeks old, and I had an extremely difficult labour which resulted in an emergency Caesarean,' says Samantha, 41. 'I was terrified, but Andy seemed unaffected by the danger. He was calm and even cracking jokes, which made me angry. But I know he wasn't being like that on purpose - it's simply how he is.' To many women, Samantha's frustration at her husband's insensitivity will sound all too familiar. Yet the traits she finds most frustrating in Andy are due to more than just stereotypical male behaviour. She now knows they are the result of Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism sometimes referred to as a 'hidden disability' because the symptoms are not always immediately apparent. It means Andy, 46, an accountant from Honiton, Devon, can have problems with social interaction and communication. People with Asperger's can often misread signals and say or do what many people would regard as inappropriate. Sam says: 'He is very precise and pedantic - if you ask him how he is, he will tell you in great detail. Or if you ask him how something works, he will give you so much information and talk for such a long time it can be baffling. I'm used to it, but I can see people who don't know him looking bewildered.' Andy says: 'Growing up I knew I was different, but I was never diagnosed. I didn't fit in. At the age of eight, I had a reading age of six. I also had a speech problem in that I spoke much too fast, and I was diagnosed with dyslexia. But I never let it hold me back, and I was always excellent at maths.' One in 125 people in Britain have been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and experts are seeing a marked increase in the numbers of adults being diagnosed with Asperger's, particularly men, who are affected four times as often as women. Asperger's sufferers are often highly intelligent and their forensic attention to detail and ability to focus can make them extremely successful in their careers. Yet the condition can have a damaging impact on personal relationships. They often struggle to pick up emotional signals from their partners and find it hard to understand how they can make them happy. For some men, getting a diagnosis of Asperger's can mean the difference between their relationship breaking down - or not. 'A lot of men in their mid-40s are being diagnosed,' says Caroline Hattersley, from the National Autistic Society. 'We've got much better at identifying the condition in young people, and often it's the case that a child will be diagnosed and then the family will recognise the traits in the father, too. 'Asperger's can make navigating two people's needs in a relationship difficult. If women don't understand why their husbands appear unfeeling, it can be hurtful. Often, a diagnosis brings relief to the person with Asperger's and their family, because it helps explain problems they've faced.' Samantha said of her husband Andy: 'He is very precise and pedantic - if you ask him how he is, he will tell you in great detail. Or if you ask him how something works, he will give you so much information and talk for such a long time it can be baffling' When Andy discovered he had Asperger's, it made sense of the behaviour Samantha had noticed since their relationship began a decade ago. 'When we met, I was struck by his intelligence, but I also noticed he has problems remembering instructions or retaining the order of a list,' she says. 'He is extremely precise, which is why he's such a good accountant, and he is never happier than poring for hours over his spreadsheets. He's very good with money and running the family budget.' Samantha says Andy is a loving, hands-on father to their five children; Reuben, seven, Georgia, six, Noah, four, Barney, two, and baby Sophie. It was after Noah was diagnosed with autism at the age of two that Andy realised he was on the Asperger's spectrum, and Samantha believes his condition has helped him bond with Noah. 'But his behaviour can be frustrating,' she says. 'When you say something to him, he will often take it literally, and when people ask him a question, he'll give an extremely fulsome answer.' Caroline Hattersley, from the National Autistic Society, outlines ten symptoms to watch out for: . 1. Difficulty in expressing emotions2. Limited interests or preoccupation  with a subject3. Low understanding of the reciprocal rules of conversation; interrupting, dominating, not participating or  shifting the topic4. Insensitivity to the non-verbal cues  of others (stance, posture, facial expressions)5. Repetitive routines or rituals6. Literal interpretation of instructions 7. Scrupulous honesty and bluntness8. Clumsiness9. Forensic attention to detail10. Compelling need to finish one task before starting another . Andy says: 'It was a shock to discover I had Asperger's, but things fell into place. I know people can be bewildered about how I function. It has helped me understand the way I am, and it helps Samantha make allowances for the way I react in certain situations.' Not every couple manages Asperger's so successfully, however. Maxine Aston is an author and therapist who specialises in marriage counselling for couples in which one or both partners has the condition. She says: 'I see a number of highly intelligent, successful men including pilots, policemen and company directors. Often they're the expert at what they do, but when they get home, they're in an emotional environment and out of their comfort zone. They often retreat - perhaps by spending hours on the computer, or leaving the house for a few days - which can send their wife into a state of confusion, assuming it's because of them. The men would love to make their wife happy, but they simply don't know how.' Many couples are referred to Maxine after counselling has failed. 'It can be damaging, because it focuses on trying to get men to talk about their emotions and think about the impact of their behaviour on their partner's feelings, but people with Asperger's can't do that. Their wives are left thinking: “He's not making an effort to make things better.” Marriages are pushed to breaking point.' Joanna and Nick Lewis's marriage was in crisis when they began visiting Maxine for counselling. The couple, both 52, from Coventry, realised Nick had Asperger's when their youngest son was diagnosed with the condition at the age of ten. As an electronics engineer, Nick was successful, but found socialising difficult and was struggling to communicate with his wife. She says: 'I knew he was a sensitive man, so I couldn't understand why he would behave like an inconsiderate idiot. I'd ask him to do something and he wouldn't; he couldn't put himself in my shoes. It was as though I was speaking English and he was speaking German.' Asperger's sufferers are often highly intelligent and extremely successful in their careers, yet the condition can have a damaging impact on personal relationships . Joanna once found her husband's trousers in the freezer. It was a hot day and he'd thought it was a sensible way to cool them down before putting them on. When they were listening to a radio concerto, he said halfway through: 'The lead violinist has changed.' Afterwards, the presenter said one of the strings on the lead violinist's bow had snapped so the second violinist had taken over. 'He'd noticed the change because his hearing is so acute. If he's listening to music, he has to have silence around him, or he feels bombarded by noise and can't cope.' If Joanna is watching TV in another room, she has to have it turned down low and the door closed. He has to sleep with ear plugs in and the windows shut. 'He has had jobs where he's struggled because he sees no need to say hello to people every morning, for example - he feels if he's said it to someone once, what's the point in repeating it day after day. He has no concept of social niceties.' She says he can come across as defensive to the point of aggression. 'He hates socialising and is very literal - if I asked how I looked, he'd tell me in frank terms. But he wouldn't understand why I got upset when he told me I looked fat, for example.' But Joanna says Asperger's has also given Nick attractive qualities, such as his phenomenal memory, his drive and passion for music. She felt Nick depended on her, yet her emotional support was not reciprocated. Counselling helped them communicate. Joanna says: 'I've learned to be more direct when I'm speaking to Nick, and I've also found it easier to accept his behaviour for what it is. I know it's not his fault he responds logically rather than emotionally. It can be lonely giving support and not getting much back. I cope because I love him.' Samantha has come to view Andy's Asperger's as a blessing in disguise. 'When Noah was diagnosed, we did some online tests to check for autistic tendencies. I found I am at the other end of the spectrum to autism - I'm creative, impulsive and emotional. So Andy's calmness, precision and air of detachment balances me out. 'I feel lucky to be married to Andy. He's a wonderful husband and father. He's worked hard over the years to understand emotions better and be a good listener, and I find his unique way of looking at the world fascinating. I'd never change him.'","Samantha and Andy Puleston from Devon discovered he had Asperger's .

The stunning photograph is one of a series of crystal-clear shots of insects taken after the morning dew had settled on a garden in Indonesia. Amateur photographer Nunu Rizani was inspired to pick up his camera after watching insects clambering over some of his children's marbles left on a wet garden table. Looking good: The tiny ladybird dangles on the tip of a plant stem and appears to gaze at its reflection in a shallow pool . Mr Rizani, 42, also snapped the ladybird and a snail perched on a plant stem and reflected in a perfectly still pool of water below in his garden in Bandung, West Java. 'When I saw a spider on the wet garden table I was interested in immortalising it,' he said. 'For a second the spider seemed to be trying to escape from the marbles, and was apparently afraid of the water. But when he realised it wasn't deep he continued to revolve around the marbles quite happily. 'A little while later I returned him to his natural habitat in some plants nearby,' he said. The photographer reached for his camera upon seeing the insects clambering over some of his children's marbles left on a wet garden table .

Mr Rizani, who works for a finance company, took up macro photography - extreme close-ups of small subjects - last year. 'I like macro photography because you see many amazing things about insects' behaviour,' he said. It takes a lot of patience on my part though. 'In this situation, I watched the insects and waited for that wonderful moment when they would play on the marbles or twigs. 'Normally they avoid water, but when they know it's not deep and that they can walk on it they are happy to. 'You need a bit of luck to catch the insects showing a beautiful and natural moment at the same time as the water produces a good reflection,' added the photographer, who said his favourite pictures were those of the ant and the spider with the marble.

Suspect: David Renz, 29, has been charged with murder, rape and kidnapping in connection to a deadly carjacking or a woman and her daughter . A man charged with killing a woman and raping her 10-year-old daughter after a carjacking at a New York mall last week was able to remove his court-ordered electronic monitoring bracelet before carrying out the brutal attacks. David Renz, 29, managed to cut the device from his ankle and put it back together so quickly that it didn't prompt BI, the company in Colorado that makes the monitors, to notify court officers in Syracuse, according to Chief U.S. Probation Officer Matt Brown. He said that officers had told the company not to notify them when the ankle monitor's signal was interrupted for a short period of time because the officers were getting tampering alerts every time the devices were knocked against bathtubs or walls. ‘We finally figured out that the circuit can be interrupted because of something as simple and innocent as that,’ Brown told Syracuse.com. Since Thursday, BI has admitted to Brown that this wasn’t the first time someone had tampered with one of its monitors this way. The company’s contract is now being reviewed by the U.S. Office of Probation and Pretrial Services in Washington as a result of this incident. Probation officers didn’t know Renz had slipped their leash until more than two hours after state police say he attacked school librarian Lori Bresnahan and her daughter outside Great Northern Mall, tied up Bresnahan, raped the girl, stabbed Bresnahan in her car and fled on foot as the girl ran away. When Renz was arrested shortly after police said he killed Bresnahan, he was not wearing the ankle monitor, which he had left at his home to prevent it from sounding an alarm. There was no alert to probation officers from BI until 11:30 p.m. That only occurred because the monitor hadn’t moved in more than four hours. At 12:30 Friday morning, state police alerted Brown that Renz had been arrested. Suspect: New York State Police lead David Renz out of the North Syracuse state police barracks Friday, March 15, 2013. Renz, 29, abducted a school librarian and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class . In 2003, BI, also known as 'Behavioral Interventions,' was found to be partly responsible for the death of a Texas woman who . was killed by an ex-boyfriend who snipped off his ankle bracelet. BI . paid the woman’s family $200,000, according to news reports. Renz was beaten and suffered a broken nose during his first night in jail, authorities said. When he appeared in federal court on Friday to face a probation violation charge, he had a swollen face and tissues stuffed up both nostrils. His attorneys, James Greenwald and Kenneth Moynihan, said Renz was assaulted by other inmates at the Onondaga County Justice Center, where he was taken following his arrest. Sheriff Kevin Walsh said he was looking into why Renz was put into a holding area with other prisoners - not the usual practice in holding someone facing such accusations. Walsh said Renz has been segregated from other prisoners and is being watched around the clock. 'We're dealing with a man who is innocent until proven guilty,' he said. 'He's got to be protected.' Renz was arraigned Friday morning at a court in East Syracuse on charges that he abducted the mother and daughter as they left a gymnastics class in the Syracuse suburb of Clay. A tracking device similar to the one Renz removed from this ankle on Thursday evening before he allegedly killed a school librarian and raped a 10-year-old girl . Police said Renz raped the girl and stabbed the mother to death before fleeing into some woods. The 10-year-old girl escaped and was found by a passing motorist, who dialed 911. Renz was captured a short time later. He had abducted the school librarian . and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class at a mall in the . Syracuse suburb of Clay, about 150 miles west of Albany, on Thursday . night. Renz bound both victims, raped the girl and . drove a short distance to a spot where the girl escaped and was found by . a passing motorist, troopers said. The motorist told 911 dispatchers he saw a . man running away from the scene, allowing police to quickly send in . officers on the ground and a sheriff's helicopter in the air. Renz was . caught a short time later near a wooded area. They believe . Renz tied up the woman and the girl and then raped the 10-year-old in a . deserted area of the mall parking lot shortly before 9pm on March 14. It was unclear how the girl escaped or when her mother was killed, authorities said. Police . are still piecing together the timeline of the crime, but their best . guess is that after assaulting the girl, Renz drove down a nearby rural . road. Crime scene: New York State Police investigate a car involved in a fatal carjacking on Verplank Road, Clay, N.Y . That’s where they think the woman, 47, who worked at an elementary school, was stabbed to death. The . girl managed to escape the scene and run down the road and was aided by . a passing driver. The child's name has not been released. The girl sustained injuries from the attack and is currently being treated at a hospital. Her mother died from multiple stab wounds. Police seem sure, however, that the suspect did not know the victims personally. Following his court appearance, the 29-year-old suspect was returned to jail, but placed into protective custody. Renz is also being guarded for now, but he will not be transferred to a different facility. The 29-year-old had been charged in . January with possession of child pornography and allowed to remain free . under terms that included staying off the internet and away from places . including schools, parks and arcades. He lost his job at a supermarket, . moved in with his mother and hadn't been able to find other work after . his arrest, according to court documents. According . to an FBI criminal complaint, agents who went to the North Syracuse . apartment where Renz was living in June found in his bedroom four . computers that he told them he used to view adult pornography. Agent . Alix Skelton said Renz eventually admitted using the internet for the . past six years to download child porn to a drive on one of the machines, . which he turned over to the agents. Technicians determined in November . that it had an encrypted hard drive, and Skelton said Renz provided the . encryption key. Agents . reviewing the drive in December found about 100 gigabytes of child porn . comprising more than 500 videos and more than 3,000 images, according to . the complaint. Among the . images were two showing sex acts involving prepubescent girls, said . Skelton, a member of a unit that targets people involved in online . exploitation of children. Renz was charged on January 9 in federal court with possession of child pornography. On Jan. 29, a judge granted a prosecutor's request for an extension of the time required for grand jury action so investigators could continue going over 'numerous items of electric media' for additional evidence. Renz, who authorities said had no prior police record, was released after agreeing to stay at home at night with an electronic monitor and away from any place he might encounter children. Late Friday afternoon, state police turned Renz over to federal authorities, who will hold him for violating the terms of his release, court documents said. Duncan said the cases against him will continue in federal and state courts. In an interview with Syracuse.com on Friday, a former manager and trainer of David Renz described him as a courteous and intelligent employee who had worked at the James Street Wegmans since his teens. The manager recalled that the 29-year-old was always willing to help customers and was 'trusted' by his superiors.","Suspect David Renz was arrested in January on child porn charges .

Detained: British TV reporter Mark Stone reports live as he is detained by police van in Beijing today for filming in Tienanmen Square . A British TV reporter was seized in China today as he tried to film in Tienanmen Square and managed to broadcast live from the back of the police van. The detention of Sky News journalist Mark Stone in the capital Beijing came as the country's new communist leader takes charge. The Asia correspondent and cameraman, Andy Portch, had been reporting on the leadership change from Tiananmen Square but were confronted by police. Officers took the journalists to a nearby police station, although a Sky News spokesman has said they have since been released and returned to company's office in Beijing. Mr Stone reported live from the back of the police van and as they arrived at the station, and explained how officers had approached the news team and asked them to stop filming. He said the authorities had intervened after they heard him refer to the student-led protests in the square in 1989. Speaking as he was removed from the van, Mr Stone said: 'This is just a little insight really into the way reporting works in China. 'Most of the time things are fine and for most of the day no problems at all, but then every now and then this happens.' Mr Stone, who was also being filmed by . the police, described it as a 'surreal experience', and added: 'It may . look like a set up, I assure you it isn't.'

Held: The journalists were then led into a room, while being filmed by the Chinese authorities . Shutdown: A police officer eventually asked for the Sky News camera to be switched off . He said the police were unaware that he was live on air and that they believed he was recording footage for later on. Mr Stone added it was 'remarkable' he was allowed to film, and said: 'I should make the point, throughout this the police have been entirely civil with us but none the less they are detaining us.' The reporter and cameraman were led into a room filled with desks and chairs, and Mr Stone said he thought they were in the Forbidden City, just north of the square. As Mr Stone tried to leave the room, an officer stopped him and said they did not have permission to film inside the 'park'. He told the news team to wait . 'patiently' because officials were coming to speak to them. The officer . also offered to translate for them but asked them to turn the camera . off. Authority: The police said Sky news did not have permission to film but the broadcaster insists it did . 'Civil': Mr Stone said the police had been 'entirely civil' to him throughout the incident . Big brother: Unaware that she is being broadcast live on Sky News, a woman films Mr Stone and his team . A Sky News spokesman said: 'Mark and Andy were told the reason for their brief detention was that they were not displaying their special press accreditation passes allowing them to film on Tiananmen  Square in a 'visible manner'.' But the broadcaster has insisted it did have permission to film in the historic square.

A pregnant woman with severe learning difficulties should be forced to have an abortion, the High Court will be told this week. Doctors are applying for an order to allow them to terminate her pregnancy as they say it is endangering her life. The woman, whose identity is kept secret for legal reasons but is described as having 'significant learning impairment', has had a series of strokes because she suffers from sickle cell disease. Case: The mentally disabled woman should be forced to have an abortion, the High Court will hear . Medics say she does not have the ability to make the decision herself and have described the need for an abortion as 'urgent'. Condition: The unnamed woman has sickle cell disease, where red blood become deformed (pictured) and can clog blood vessels causing breathing problems and even strokes . The woman's sickle cell disease is very serious and the baby must be . terminated very soon to reduce the risk of her losing her life, they say. Her condition means that her red blood cells develop abnormally, preventing oxygen being supplied around the body properly. The cells' shape can also clog blood vessels, affecting . breathing and leading to anaemia, severe respiratory problems, strokes . and in some cases death. Around 250,000 people in the UK are believed to have it, and it is more prevalent among ethnic minorities. The case will be argued by an NHS trust in southern England in the Court of Protection, sitting at the High Court in London. Until recently the Court of Protection sat in secret and is charged with ruling on 'life and death' cases where patients are deemed incapable of making a decision themselves. But it has also been criticised for some of the rulings it has made. The authorities have previously stopped a dementia patient going on the holiday of a lifetime because it was deemed too dangerous and forced another individual to use contraception. This latest case contrasts the plight of Savita Halappanavar, the . Indian dentist who was refused an abortion of her dying foetus in Ireland. She later died of blood poisoning and the case led to heated debate about whether abortion should be legalised in certain circumstances.","The NHS say that the termination is 'urgent' and her life is in danger .

And are you bored of never knowing whether to plump for a small, medium or large in Zara? A revolutionary 'virtual tape measure'  - known as Body Shape Recognition For Online Fashion - promises to make badly fitting clothes (and even badly lit fitting rooms) a thing of the past, advising the user on which size dress, trouser or top they should buy in every retailer. Currently, between 30 and 60 per cent of all clothes bought online are returned to the shop, and the new virtual tape measure aims to reduce the amount . The web-based body-scanner would take detailed measurements of the body via webcam or smartphone, create a 3D image of the user, then advise on which size garment to buy whenever they visit the website of a participating retailer. Taking multiple measurements of the body, the system aims to ensure the best possible fit, saving shoppers and retailers millions of pounds a year in return postage costs, as well as eliminating the need to send back clothes that are the wrong size or fit. Currently, between 30 and 60 per cent of all clothes bought online are returned to the shop. The new process could revolutionise online clothes-shopping for both the retailer and the consumer . Body scanning is already starting to make . a mark in the clothing retail sector, but these often involve the user stepping into a machine that 'photocopies' the body. The new software - being developed by London College of Fashion and computer vision experts at the University of Surrey - requires only a photo of the user in their underwear, their height, and an internet connection. Philip Delamore from London College of Fashion said: 'The potential benefits for the fashion . industry and for shoppers are huge. 'Currently, it's common for . online shoppers to order two or three different sizes of the same item . of clothing at the same time, as they’re unsure which one will fit . best.' Professor Adrian Hilton from the . University of Surrey says: 'It's unrealistic to expect online clothes . shoppers to have the time or inclination to take a series of highly . accurate body measurements of themselves. The new system makes it all . very easy.' The 18-month project Body Shape Recognition for Online Fashion is being developed in collaboration with body-mapping specialists Bodymetrics and digital creative agency Guided. Some £18,000 of funding is being provided by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). The research builds on previous work by the University of Surrey in developing 3D body-shape templates from single-view images, which has been used commercially in creating animated representations of people for games such as The Sims.

An American stuntman has become the first person in more than a century to cross the Niagara Falls on a tightrope. Nik Wallenda, 33, was watched by an estimated one billion TV viewers and more than 125,000 sightseers at the famous gorge. He took 25 minutes to traverse the 1,800ft gap from Canada to the US on a 2 in-thick steel cable on Friday night. The water crashed over the precipice at 65mph, 200ft below him, and he was buffeted by swirling clouds of spray. But ignoring the No  1 rule of tightrope-walking, he looked down as he walked, rather than straight ahead. To aid his balance, he held a 40ft pole, attached by a brace to his neck. He also wore a safety harness attached to the cable. ‘This is what dreams are made of,’ said Wallenda shortly after he stepped off from a platform on the American shore. ‘I hope what I just did inspires people to reach for the skies.’ American James Hardy, 21, made several crossings of the gorge in 1896, but it was further from the waterfall and not as dangerous as Wallenda’s walk. Feat: Nik Wallenda walks across the Niagara Falls in an attempt to be the first man ever to complete the walk . Danger: Mr Wallenda was finely poised above the surging waterfall which has taken many casualties in the past . Relief: The daredevil punched the air when he made it to the other side after 25 minutes . Epic: Mr Wallenda described the view over the Falls, which he is the only person ever to have seen, as 'breathtaking' Torrents: The skilled tightrope walker never broke his concentration, even when surrounded by the rush of thousands of gallons of water . Spray: The water coming off the Falls was just one of several weather phenomena which Mr Wallenda had to contend with . Scale: From afar, the walker is barely visible against the background of the mighty Niagara Falls . Breathtaking: The spectacle enjoyed by Mr Wallenda during his unique experience is unlike that granted to anyone else . Setting out: Mr Wallenda pictured just a couple of minutes after starting his walk, when he was still walking downhill into the 'valley' of the rope . Wallenda, whose next stunt will be an attempt to traverse the Grand Canyon, took steady, measured steps across the . mist-fogged brink of the roaring falls. The daring . acrobat set off around 10.15 to whoops and cheers from the huge crowd at . the atmospheric event. An estimated crowd of 125,000 people . on the Canadian side and 4,000 on the American side watched. Along the . way, he calmly prayed aloud. Afterwards, he said he accomplished . the feat through 'a lot of praying, that's for sure. But, you know, it's . all about the concentration, the focus, and the training.' The seventh-generation member of the . famed Flying Wallendas had long dreamed of pulling off the stunt, never . before attempted. After he made it to the Canadian side . of the falls, Mr Wallenda said that at one point in the middle of the . stunt, he thought about his great-grandfather and the walks he had . taken: 'That's what this is all about, paying tribute to my ancestors, . and my hero, Karl Wallenda.' Scenic: Those who made the journey to watch Mr Wallenda were awarded with a once-in-a-lifetime view . Nearly there: Mr Wallenda became visibly more cheerful, though tired, when he was in sight of his Canadian destination . Home stretch: Mr Wallenda showboats for the crowd as he reaches the final few yards of his amazing walk . Coming in: The acrobat was delighted to find an eager crowd waiting for him when he arrived in Canada . Departure: Crowds in New York state watch Mr Wallenda start his quest to cross the Falls, unsure if he would make it all the way . Packed: There was barely enough space for all those who wanted to watch the feat to do so . A festive crowd started to gather on . both sides of the border on Friday afternoon, spreading blankets and . setting up folding chairs under picture-perfect blue skies and . summer-like temperatures. 'We're here on a lark. We're looking . for an adventure,' said Carole Halls, who with her husband pulled their . nine- and 11-year-old kids out of school early to stake out space on a . grassy slope across from where Mr Wallenda finished his walk on the . Canadian side. Ms Halls, of Oakville, Ontario, was . all in favor of the tether, Mr Wallenda's one safeguard, designed to . keep him out of the water if he falls. 'I think we have enough gore on TV,' she said. Route: This graphic shows how Mr Wallenda plans to make his way from the U.S. side of the Falls to the Canadian side . Waiting for him: The tightrope across Niagara Falls pictured ahead of Nik Wallenda's attempt to walk across it on Friday night .

The first to cross the gorge: French acrobat and tightrope walker Charles Blondin was the first ever person to cross a section of Niagara Falls on a 1,000 foot long tightrope in 1859, but chose a calmer spot downstream .

A . C-shaped clamp trailed behind him on the walk, designed to allow . free passage over the pendulum anchors. If he had slipped, he would dangle by his . waist about eight feet below the wire to wait for rescue. ABC, . which televised the walk, insisted on it. Mr Wallenda said he only . agreed because he was not willing to lose the chance and needed ABC's . sponsorship to help offset some of the $1.3million cost of the . spectacle. Conditions were . good leading up to the nationally televised stunt scheduled for Friday . night. When he left terra firma about 10.15pm, the temperature was in . the low 60s with winds under 10mph from the east, roughly at his back. 'I think it's a crazy idea,' said . Maurice Wang, 59, he drove from Toronto to watch the walk from the . Canadian shore. 'Someone has to be really committed. You can't just say, . ""Oh, I want to try it."" He's got my respect for that.' On . the U.S. side of the falls, cars lined the road into Goat Island as . people jockeyed for good spots to watch Mr Wallenda's 1,800-foot walk on . a two-inch wire through the mist rising from the falls. For the 33-year-old father of three, the Niagara Falls walk was unlike anything he has ever done. Because it was over water, the two-inch wire did not have the usual stabiliser cables to keep it from swinging. Pendulum anchors were designed to keep it from twisting under the elkskin-soled shoes designed by his mother. The Wallendas trace their roots to 1780 Austria-Hungary, when ancestors traveled as a band of acrobats, aerialists, jugglers, animal trainers and trapeze artists. In 1928, the family gave its inaugural performance at Madison Square Garden and earned a 15-minute standing ovation from an astounded audience, who marveled at them performing without a safety net. And the clan has been touched by tragedy, notably in 1978 when patriarch Karl Wallenda, Nik's great-grandfather, fell to his death during a stunt in Puerto Rico. About a dozen other tightrope artists have crossed the Niagara Gorge downstream, dating to Jean Francois Gravelet, aka The Great Blondin, in 1859. But no one has walked directly over the falls and authorities have not allowed any tightrope acts in the area since 1896. It took Mr Wallenda two years to persuade U.S. and Canadian authorities to allow it and many civic leaders hoped to use the publicity to jumpstart the region's struggling economy, particularly on the U.S. side of the falls.","Nik Wallenda is the first person to walk over the Falls at their greatest extent and took just 25 minutes to do it .

Two pagans were sentenced to more than a decade in prison today after being found guilty of abusing children in bizarre sex rituals as part of a witches' coven. Peter Petrauske and Jack Kemp were said to have worn ceremonial robes and pagan paraphernalia while they abused young girls in Cornwall during the 1970s. Police believe one of their victims may have been as young as three when the abuse started. The judge described the victims' experiences as 'nothing less than harrowing' as he condemned their 'utterly horrifying' crimes, sentencing Petrauske to 18 years in prison and Kemp to 14. Convicted: Peter Petrauske, left, and Jack Kemp, right, have been found guilty of sexually abusing young girls . The pair, aged 72 and 69, showed little emotion as they were led from the dock at Truro Crown Court and into custody. Petrauske, who described himself as the high priest of a white witches’ coven in St Ives, was convicted of one count of rape, one count of aiding and abetting an attempt to rape, and one count of indecent assault. Kemp was found guilty of indecent assault and indecency with a child. He was found not guilty of four other sexual offences, following more than 11 hours' deliberation. 'I am satisfied that you have both had a lifelong sexual interest in young female children,' judge Graham Cottle told the defendants during sentencing. 'You were two of the surviving members of a paedophile ring. Together with others whose names have been repeatedly featured in this trial, you were members of a ring that operated in the Falmouth area in the 70s and 80s. 'During the course of this trial some of the evidence in this case in relation to the offences committed against young children has been nothing less than harrowing - it has featured ritualistic sexual abuse of young children.' Guilty: Kemp, right, had denied the abuse claims and said he was not involved in pagan rituals at all . Witch: Petrauske has described himself as the high priest of a white witches' coven . He added that many of the pair's . victims had little prospect of recovering from their experiences and had . suffered years of emotional problems including flashbacks. The judge described their offences as 'utterly horrifying', say they were 'terrifying events' involving 'defenceless children'. 'Finally the truth about your lies and your undoubted propensities has caught up with you,' he concluded. The jury of nine men and three women are still considering their verdicts on several other sexual offences. Mr Cottle said he would accept a majority verdict on the remaining charges. Peter Solheim, with a large sword, performing a druid ritual at ST Merryn Stone Circle in North Cornwall, with Rose Parish, left, and an unamed woman, right . Deadly relationship: Peter Solheim, left, who was killed by his girlfriend Margaret James, right, was also believed to have been involved in the pagan sex crimes . Ritual: Solheim, centre, and James, right, performing a pagan ceremony at Merryn stone circle in Cornwall . The pair’s victims gave harrowing . evidence from behind a screen during the three-week trial. They said . they were abused by their tormentors, then given money and sweets to buy . their silence. In a dramatic twist, witnesses also . named murdered pagan Peter Solheim and notorious Cornish paedophile Stan . Pirie as among their abusers. Solheim . was a 56-year-old parish councillor whose body was found five miles off . the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall by fishermen on June 18 2004. He . had been drugged and mutilated by a machete or an axe, and his . girlfriend Margaret James was later convicted of conspiring to murder . him, though her accomplice was never discovered. Pagans: The jury at Truro Crown Court, pictured, heard from victims about the ritualistic sex abuse . The child abuse was only investigated . further by police last year when Kemp was arrested in connection with . another incident, causing rumours to spread around his home town of . Falmouth and prompting the alleged victims of the historic offences to . contact detectives. The other charges include indecent . assault and other sexual offences, and were believed to have been . committed much more recently. Petrauske was backed up by female . members of the coven who said that while children were occasionally . present, nudity never played a part in the ceremonies. One female friend . also described him as 'a gentleman'. Kemp denied any involvement in . paganism, saying it 'wasn't his cup of tea', and claimed he was the . victim of a bizarre conspiracy. He said the girls were wrong to name him . in the case. The jury have retired to consider verdicts on the remaining counts. The two men are set to be sentenced this afternoon.

The latest round of energy price rises will leave another 300,000 families struggling to pay their heating bills this Christmas, the Government's adviser on fuel poverty warns today. In a devastating report, the ­independent Fuel Poverty Advisory Group said Government initiatives were 'completely inadequate to tackle the scale of the problem' and warned that ministers were doing too little to 'soften the blow' of costly green ­measures which are forecast to send energy bills even higher. It warns that the number of households struggling to pay their bills is expected to hit more than nine million by 2016 – the date by which the last government pledged to end fuel poverty. Toxic cocktail: Derek Lickorish blames wholesale prices, cost of reforms and cuts in income . It is estimated that four million households are currently in fuel poverty, or forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income to keep their home warm. Around half of those are pensioners, while a further fifth contain at least one child aged five or under. In a separate report published today, the Institute for Public Policy Research warns that an initiative to force energy firms to insulate the homes of poorer customers could add up to £116 to the average bill. The FPAG's study suggests that average gas bills have increased by 40 per cent in the past five years, with electricity bills up by 24 per cent. Recent price rises are expected to push bills up by a further 7 per cent, taking the average dual fuel bill to £1,365 a year. Those living in homes not connected to mains gas pay an average of £2,100 a year. The price rises are expected to leave a further 300,000 families in fuel poverty. Derek Lickorish, chairman of the . FPAG, which was set up to provide advice for ministers, said: 'Millions . are living in misery due to high energy bills. 'Yet time is running out for the Government to poverty-proof the homes of those on the lowest incomes. Radical reform: Mr Lickorish's group has dismissed Government initiatives as 'inadequate' Action needed: The Mail has been highlighting the growing energy crisis facing millions of households . 'A . toxic cocktail of rising wholesale prices, the high cost of energy . reforms and cuts in incomes for many households means fuel poverty . levels are set to skyrocket without radical action.' Mr . Lickorish, a former energy company executive, said green measures . driven by Brussels would add £63billion to bills in the next 15 years – . equal to more than £4billion a year. He said the money should be used to fund a drive to insulate Britain's ageing housing stock. On top of that, industry regulator Ofgem also warned today that planned improvements to the UK's gas and electricity network will add an average £12 to energy bills over the next eight years. Ofgem's final recommendations, outlined today, will allow firms such as National Grid to shell out £24.2billion on new and improved infrastructure. The regulator had previously recommended improvements of £22.7billion in July, but the latest figure still falls short of the £29.4billion originally requested by energy companies raising the prospect of a referral to the Competition Commission. National Grid will respond to Ofgem's recommendations by March, but in the summer it accused Ofgem of not going far enough to incentivise companies to carry out the work needed. The cost of the work, which will include laying undersea cables linking Scotland with England and Wales, will see tariffs rise by an average of £8.50 in 2013/14, £7.30 the following year and soaring to as high as £15.10 in 2020/21. The UK's high voltage electricity grid, high pressure gas network and some of its low pressure gas networks are run by National Grid. The rest of the low pressure gas network and the low voltage electricity network are run by other companies. These companies pass on fees to consumers and households via energy suppliers, which will rise under the proposals. The majority of the money - up to £15.5 billion - would be used to upgrade and renew the high voltage electricity network in England and Wales and the high pressure gas network across the UK, creating some 7,000 jobs in the supply chain. A further £7 billion would be spent on making sure the gas networks to homes and businesses remain safe and reliable and would connect 80,000 households to the gas network for the first time. Under pressure: Environment secretary Owen Paterson is facing strong calls for action . Today's news comes after the . Government recently announced proposals to require energy firms to . provide only four tariffs for each fuel and to place all customers on . the cheapest price available for their chosen tariff. But critics have warned that the . plans could see an end to cheap deals, stop consumers switching . suppliers, reduce competition and push up bills in the long run. Mike O'Connor, chief executive of the . consumer watchdog Consumer Focus, said research shows 6million . households plan to cut back on heating this winter due to fears about . costs. Mr O'Connor, who backed the call to . use revenues from green taxes to insulate homes, said: 'Current . ­Government plans for energy ­efficiency schemes are inadequate to deal . with the scale of the fuel poverty problem. 'Millions of older people, families . and people with disabilities will be left living in cold homes and . struggling to afford their bills unless extra measures are taken.' Figures released this week by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which advises the Treasury, suggest that energy prices will rise by a further 5 per cent next year. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said two million households were already set to benefit from Government help on heating costs, including one million pensioners who will get £130 off their bill. The spokesman said: 'We have also already announced our intention to launch a new fuel poverty strategy next year to make sure we are targeting help at those who need it most. 'The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group has an important part to play in helping us assess our progress in this area and we will now carefully consider the recommendations set out in their annual report.'","Fuel Poverty Advisory Group slams 'inadequate' Government initiatives .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 10:10 EST, 13 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:43 EST, 14 December 2012 . Jailed: Wlodzimierz Umaniec has been sentenced to two years in prison for vandalising a Rothko painting . The self-proclaimed artist who vandalised a Mark Rothko painting in what he said was an act of 'yellowism' was today sentenced to two years in prison. Wlodzimierz Umaniec, 26, also known as Vladimir Umanets, defaced the mural, worth around £5million to £9million, at the Tate Modern gallery on October 7. He has said he carried out the crime in an attempt to spread the principles of the obscure artistic movement which he helped create. Umaniec, a Polish national living in . Worthing, West Sussex, admitted criminal damage to the value of in . excess of £5,000 - but estimates suggest the restoration of the painting . will cost around £200,000. The . vandal stepped over a barrier in the art gallery and daubed his name . and the words 'a potential piece of yellowism' before fleeing. The . court heard that he went to the gallery intending to put his . 'signature' on a picture, but decided to damage the Rothko painting only . in the moment he saw it on display. The gallery was then put into 'operation shutdown' with people prevented from leaving or entering the building. Umaniec . has argued that his actions were themselves a work of art, as the rules . of 'yellowism' dictate that anything can be an example of the genre as . long as it is endorsed by a member of the movement. But . judge Roger Chapple said of 'yellowism' that it was 'wholly and utterly . unacceptable to promote it by damaging a work of art' which he called a . 'gift to the nation'. Art? Umaniec claimed that his vandalism was in itself a powerful artistic statement . Speaking . at Inner London Crown Court, he told Umaniec: 'Your actions on the 7th . of October of this year were entirely deliberate, planned and . intentional.' He said . it was 'abundantly clear' that Umaniec was 'plainly an intelligent man' and told the court he had described Rothko as a 'great painter' in a . letter he had written to him. The judge also said the incident had led to galleries reviewing security arrangements at a cost to themselves and the taxpayer. 'The effects of such security reviews is to distance the public from the works of art they come to enjoy,' he said. Supporter: Umaniec was accompanied by Ben Smith, who attempted to explain the principles of 'yellowism' Gregor McKinley, prosecuting, said: 'The work required to restore this picture will be complex and lengthy. 'Complications to this work include the unique painting technique used by the artist and the fact the ink used by Mr Umaniec has permeated the paint layers and the canvas itself.' Mr McKinley said work to restore the painting will take about 20 months and cost 'something around £200,000'. Paintings by Russian-born artist Rothko often fetch tens of millions of pounds. Earlier this year, his Orange, Red, Yellow sold in New York for £53.8million - the highest price paid for a piece of post-War art at auction. The defaced painting, called Black On Maroon, was donated to the Tate in 1969 by Rothko himself. Outside court before the sentencing, Ben Smith, who called himself a 'yellowist', attempted to explain the concept: 'Everything is equal. Everything is art. Everything is a potential piece of yellowism.' After the sentencing, Mr Smith, who had come along to support Umaniec in court, said Umaniec's time in prison would be 'one of the most creative points for him' and will 'give him a greater understanding of humanity'. Speaking about the incident he said: 'This was not an act of destruction. It was an act of creativity. 'Now yellowism is a global phenomenon.' A spokeswoman for the gallery said: 'Tate is pleased that the court has recognised the severity of this incident and its consequences when sentencing Wlodzimierz Umaniec to two years in prison.'","Wlodzimierz Umaniec, 26, claimed vandalism was itself a piece of art .

The Newport West MP also gives tips on how to get a seat in the House of Lords once your Commons’ career is over. In a guide to sex and booze in Westminster, Mr Flynn says flings are ‘inevitable’ and he writes of ‘furtive encounters in parliamentary offices when resistance levels are falling and testosterone levels are rising .  .  . serial seducers of both sexes roam the corridors’.

Dr Alex Moulton CBE , who invented Moulton bicycles, photographed at home in his estate in Bradford on Avon. He died on Sunday, aged 92 . Dr. Moulton's revolutionary small-wheeled, full-suspension Moulton bicycle was unique. It proved popular among commuters as it has suspension, which uses rubber and can be easily taken apart for transport. The design uses a 'F' design, and can be seperated easily so commuters can stow it in a boot.The bicycle is still built by hand in Bradford on Avon by a loyal team of engineers, technicians and craftsmen overseen by general manager and Alex's nephew Shaun Moulton. His death was announced on the website of the Mouton Bicycle Company, which still handmakes and sells bikes based on his iconic design. 'It is with great sorrow that Shaun Moulton and The Moulton Bicycle Company announce the news that Dr. Alexander Eric Moulton CBE, distinguished engineer and inventor, passed away peacefully in the company of his family and staff on Sunday evening, 9th December 2012, at the age of 92. 'Dr. Moulton was an inspiration for generations of engineers, designers and inventors,' it says. 'Educated at Marlborough and Cambridge, Alex Moulton worked at Bristol Aeroplanes as assistant to Sir Roy Fedden during WW2. 'He joined Bradford on Avon rubber manufacturers Spencer Moulton in 1945, leading a new research team. 'His collaboration with Sir Alec Issigonis resulted in Moulton suspension, including ‘Hydrolastic’ and ‘Hydragas’ systems, being employed in over twelve million British cars from the original Mini to the MGF.' The Moulton led to a cycling revolution in the 60s.

Dr Alex Moulton with the Mini he designed the suspension system for. The radical gas system was later used in other iconic British cars such as the MGF. The great-grandson of rubber pioneer Stephen Moulton, Dr Moulton was educated at Marlborough and later at King's College, Cambridge where he graduated in engineering. In the late 1950s, he worked with Sir Alec Issigonis - the man who designed the Mini - to create a suspension system which allowed the car's overall small size. Sir James Dyson, inventor and entrepreneur. 'The most extraordinary thing about Alex Moulton was that he was a designer and an engineer who invented two of the most iconic products of our age: the wheels and suspension for the mini, and the Moulton bicycle. 'I first met Alex as a student in the sixties. 'What immediately struck me was that he was someone who put engineering first and yet still considered the whole product. 'That perspective has helped guide me throughout my career. 'Over the years, we regularly met for dinner to discuss our products and engineering difficulties -  He was an inspiration to me. 'Without having met Alex, I would not have had the courage to be both a designer and an engineer. 'The interesting thing about Alex was that he stuck to suspension and bicycles, two finite fields in which he became a world expert. 'Through iterative development, he created the most extraordinary, unusual products culminating in the beautifully thin stainless steel space frame bicycle. 'I think it is an important lesson to learn that sticking to one thing and reinventing yourself leads to a place that no one else can ever get to.' It was a huge success, and was used in later cars, including the MGF. However, he was best known for his bicycle, which was unveiled at the 1962 Earls Court Cycle Show. Dr . Moulton said the unique design, was 'born out of my resolve to . challenge and improve upon the classic bicycle, with its diamond frame . and large wheels, which has locked bicycle design into that form since . the pioneering work in England of Starley and others at the end of the . 19th Century.' At events . held to marks the 50th anniversary of the design last month, Lord Norman . Foster hailed it as an icon ""synonymous with the Mini, the mini-skirt - . the mini bike. The Moulton family were originally law stationers in London, and Stephen Moulton became involved in the rubber business more by accident than design. He acquired a licence to manufacture vulcanised rubber from the American Charles Goodyear, with a view to selling it on and making a profit on the transaction. When he hawked round his licence, however, the British rubber industry was unmoved, so eventually he went into the business himself. Sir James Dyson paid tribute to Dr Moulton for setting a 'good example to our [Dyson] engineers'. British engineer and inventor, Dr Alex Moulton, who invented Moulton bicycles, photographed at home in his estate in Bradford on Avon with a model of his iconic design . The design also sparked a revolution in cycling in London in the 60s, and according to the firm 'all of today's small wheeled cycles owe a debt of gratitude to the original Moulton 'F' frame design which not only introduced and proved the concept of full-size bicycles with small wheels, but also, right from launch in 1962, have utilised front and rear suspension systems for improved comfort and performance.'

Nasa today released two new images taken from its Dawn spacecraft as it left the giant Vesta asteroid. The first set of images is a color-coded relief map of Vesta's northern hemisphere, from the pole to the equator. Nasa's Dawn mission has revealed the topography of the northern and southern hemispheres of the giant asteroid Vesta. Vesta was discovered in 1807, the fourth . asteroid to be identified in the great belt of rocky debris orbiting . between Mars and Jupiter. At the time, its great scale meant it was designated as another planet . but it later lost this status as researchers learnt more about the . diversity of objects in the Solar System. It incorporates images taken just as . Dawn began to creep over the high northern latitudes, which were dark . when Dawn arrived in July 2011. The other image is a black-and-white mosaic that shows a full view of the giant asteroid, created by synthesizing some of Dawn's best images. 'Dawn has peeled back the veil on some of the mysteries surrounding Vesta, but we're still working hard on more analysis,' said Christopher Russell, Dawn's principal investigator at UCLA. 'So while Vesta is now out of sight, it will not be out of mind.' The images mark the end of Dawn's year-long encounter with the 330mile-wide asteroid Vesta, making the mission the first to enter orbit around a main-belt asteroid. The main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, 117million miles from Earth. The asteroid looks like a punctured football, the result of a colossal collision sometime in its past that knocked off its south polar region. Dawn will now depart for its second destination, the dwarf planet Ceres. This will make it the first spacecraft to orbit two solar system destinations beyond Earth.

The money has been used to fund the Islamic state’s security and border forces in an effort to stem the supply of drugs into Europe. But campaign group Reprieve, which carried out the investigation, said recent spending had coincided with a huge surge in the number of alleged traffickers executed for their crimes. The number arrested and executed . by the Iranian state has been described as a ‘killing spree of . staggering proportions’ by another campaign group, Amnesty . International. Over a four-year period when Britain has been handing its anti-drug aid, Iran has executed more than 1,000 alleged traffickers. There . are also fears that the spending on security equipment such as 4x4 . vehicles, night-vision goggles and mobile phone scanning devices could . be used to crack down on dissent. The revelations come days after David . Cameron mounted a spirited defence of his  policy of increasing foreign . aid, saying Britain had a ‘moral obligation’ to help the world’s poor, . even during times of austerity at home. The . Prime Minister acknowledged it was ‘difficult’ to make the case, but . said specific programmes, such as those directed at tackling disease or . child malnutrition, were producing tangible benefits. He said the British people were ‘very . generous’, but said it was in the UK’s wider interests to ensure that . troubled states such as Somalia did not descend into chaos and fuel . illegal immigration and terrorism. However, . the fact that millions has been spent on aid to Iran will heighten . public concern that taxpayers’ money is being wasted or used unwisely. Concern: 488 people were hanged in Iran for drug offences in 2011 (file picture) Reprieve . investigator Maya Foa said: ‘It’s outrageous that Britain, which is . supposed to be committed to the abolition of capital punishment, should . in fact be funding executions for drug offences in Iran. Given the . country’s appalling record on human rights, there will be real concerns . about how the equipment and support provided by Britain is being used. ‘Hundreds . are being hanged every year, including children, vulnerable people and . innocent scapegoats; that Britain should have played a part in this . tragedy is shameful.’ Iran borders Afghanistan, which is responsible for around 90 per cent of the world’s opium production. In 2008 Iran executed 96 people for drug trafficking. The following year that rose to 172, then 360 in 2010 and 488 in 2011. Three quarters of all executions carried out in the country are for drug offences, and those sentenced to death include a 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy. Reprieve said arrests had soared during a £750,000 joint UK-France investigations project in Iran in 2010-11 and several of those arrested had been sentenced to death. Partnership: David Cameron's government funds a scheme administered by the Iranian regime of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, right . Between 2007 and 2010 Britain, France, Belgium and Ireland jointly funded a £1.73million border control project, which paid for security equipment, personnel training and paid for body scanners, sniffer dogs and other equipment. Britain also paid up £117,000 for equipment including motorcycles, software and mobile telephone interception equipment, the investigation found. Since 1998 the UK has provided at least £3.6million for anti-drug programmes. The Government has refused to provide a breakdown of funding in recent years. Much of the funding goes through the UN Office on Drugs and Crime – making it even harder to track where it ends up. In September 2011 Foreign Secretary William Hague met the Iranian foreign minister at the UN in New York and said he wanted ‘deeper cooperation’ with Iran on fighting drug trafficking. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘Taxpayers expect the aid budget to be directly helping the world’s vulnerable and needy, not spent on beefing up borders in Iran.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We provide aid to a range of partners to tackle the international drugs trade and minimise the threat it poses to the UK. ‘We take human rights very seriously and provide clear guidance to our officials. It is our policy not to disclose details about specific programmes or locations as to do so may reduce the effectiveness of this work.’ The Prime Minister has stuck to his pre-election pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on foreign aid. In a letter to G8 leaders yesterday Mr Cameron called for a major drive against corruption in the developing world. He said showing that aid money was well spent was ‘vital’ in securing lasting support for it in the West. But at the weekend an Ipsos/Mori poll revealed that only one in four people now back the Coalition’s aid policy. More than 60 per cent said most of the money spent on aid was ‘wasted’.","Reprieve said money coincides with surge in alleged trafficker executions .

Thousands of passengers aboard a Carnival cruise ship could finally say goodbye to their tortuous 'vacation.' The first flights of passengers from the Carnival Dream began arriving to Orlando International Airport on Friday relieved and shockingly not that irritated at being stranded in the Caribbean. The Carnival Dream had been in St Maarten on the final stop of a seven-day Caribbean cruise when the crew announced a 'mechanical issue' with a diesel generator, passengers said. Passengers from the Carnival Dream await their luggage as they finally get back to the Orlando International Airport . After arriving at Orlando's airport, passengers will be transported via shuttle to Port Canaveral, Florida, where the cruise ship was originally supposed to dock . Passengers made their way to buses that Carnival had booked for them outside of the Orlando airport . According to passengers, they were not allowed to disembark the ship when it had docked in St Maarten. Nine charter flights will be arriving in Orlando on Friday and Saturday. Earlier this week the company announced that it would be making 'comprehensive reviews' to all their ships. After leaving St Maarten many of the Carnival passengers looked weary as they headed home early from the Caribbean cruise via the airport.. Thousands of travelers crowded into the small international airport on St Maarten as Carnival began the logistical nightmare of getting everyone off the island on flights as it became apparent that no one was sailing back to Port Canaveral in Florida. Scroll down for video . Deja-vu: Weary passengers from the Carnival Dream cruise ship wait at the international airport in Philipsburg, Sint Maarten to catch flights home after their trip was cut short . Sent packing: Passengers from the Carnival Dream had their holiday come to an abrupt end following mechanical problems with the ship . Trouble in paradise: The Carnival Dream, pictured on Thursday, is flying passengers back to the U.S. from St Maarten after it reported problems with its propulsion system leading to overflowing toilets . Late on Thursday, the company . announced that another ship, the Carnival Legend had 'a technical issue' affecting the sailing speed, forcing the cancellation of a stop in . Grand Cayman Islands. The . ship is expected to arrive in Tampa as scheduled on Sunday following a . seven-day cruise. Passengers will get a $100 credit, refunds on . pre-purchased shore excursions in Grand Cayman and half off on a future . cruise. In an official statement to . MailOnline, Carnival said: 'Legend is experiencing a technical issue . with one of the ship’s Azipod units that is affecting the vessel’s . sailing speed. The ship's safety systems and hotel services are all . functioning normally. 'Because . of the reduction in sailing speed, today’s visit to Grand Cayman has . been cancelled and the ship will proceed to its homeport of Tampa, where . it is expected to arrive on Sunday as scheduled.' The . Dream, which is docked in St Maarten, was forced to fly passengers home . after the ship experienced overflowing toilets and power outages. Carnival . said that only one public restroom had an overflowing toilet and there . was a separate request for cleaning of a bathroom in a guest's cabin. Guests on the ship said that there had been minor disruptions to power and water, lasting between  ten to 20 minutes. The . recent plague of problems on board Carnival ships comes after the . Carnival Elation was helped back to port in New Orleans by tugboat last . Saturday. Officials reported a 'minor issue' with steering. Going home: The Carnival Legend has had a 'technical issue' with its sailing speed and is heading back from Grand Cayman Islands to Tampa, Florida today . It comes a month after sister ship, the Carnival Triumph, was stranded for five days in the Gulf of Mexico. Carnival announced on Thursday that guests are being flown off the island of St Maarten where the Dream is moored. Passengers will be refunded for three days of the trip and get a 50 per cent discount on future voyages. The cruise ship, which has a capacity of 3,646 passengers and 1,367 crew, is docked at Phillipsburg in the Caribbean on the last leg of a seven-day cruise from Florida. Party's over: Passengers have been flying home after their seven-day cruise on the Carnival Dream was cut short on Thursday . Dream's captain alerted authorities of possible trouble with the ship's propulsion system on Wednesday, a U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman in Miami said. Several passengers told CNN that guests had been held on the boat despite the fact toilets were overflowing and unusable on Wednesday. Gregg . Stark, who is on vacation with his wife and two children, said 'human . waste' was sloshing on to the floors of some of the ship's bathrooms. He added: 'The elevators have not been working. They've been turning them on and off, on and off.' Other passengers said that crew had . announced over the tannoy system that generator problems would take an . hour to fix but that seven hours later, the unsavory situation remained. Lights out: The Carnival Dream appeared to have darkened decks on Thursday as passengers made their way to the airport to fly back to Florida . Back to reality: Thousands of passengers on the Carnival Dream are being flown back to Florida which takes around two hours . Trouble at sea: The Carnival Dream has reported problems with its propulsion system leading to overflowing toilets at port in St Maarten, Caribbean (stock image) The ship had been due to leave the Caribbean island at 5pm on Wednesday after making the trip from Port Canaveral. Passengers will now fly the two hours back to Florida on both commercial and private charter flights. Petty Officer Sabrina Laberdesque said the ship has functioning sewage and power systems, adding that officials are working to correct the problems. She said the Coast Guard is not involved because the ship is moored. Carnival shares fell 1.3 per cent on Thursday morning to $35.24 after the cruise cancellation was announced. The Carnival Dream has a technical issue with the ship’s back-up emergency diesel generator which our engineering team is currently working on. Yesterday, during regularly scheduled testing of the ship’s emergency diesel generator, a malfunction occurred. At no time did the ship lose power and the ship’s propulsion systems and primary power source was not impacted. The ship is at dock in St. Maarten. All guests are safe and comfortable. There were periodic interruptions to elevators and restroom services for a few hours last night. However, all hotel systems are functioning normally and have been functional since approximately 12.30am. While personnel continue to work on the technical issue we are making arrangements to fly all guests home via private charter flights and scheduled flights from St. Maarten. Guests on the current voyage will receive a refund equivalent to three days of the voyage and 50 percent off a future cruise. We are also cancelling the ship's next voyage which is scheduled to depart on Saturday, March 16. Guests scheduled to sail on this cruise will receive a full refund and 25 per cent off a future seven-day cruise. Guests who re-book will have their current rate protected on the future sailing.Additionally, any non-refundable transportation related expenses will be reimbursed. Yesterday was a scheduled port of call visit to St. Maarten. Guests were able to spend the full day in port and have the option of continuing to do so until their scheduled return home. All of the ship's activities and facilities are fully operational. We are very sorry for this disruption to our guests' vacation plans and extend our sincere apologies. We look forward to welcoming them back on another Carnival cruise. The Carnival Dream was on the last leg of a seven-day cruise and was docked in St. Maarten when the technical problem arose. The ship is based in Port Canaveral, Florida.

Several lawsuits have been launched against Carnival - but whether complainants will have any success is doubtful as the cruise company has a legal structure that shields it from big-money lawsuits.

Facing jail: Kamran Ajaib used Y-fronts to clean his premises, Hamza Poultry Limited in Bristol . A meat distributor supplied up to 30 tons of filthy chicken to takeaways every week from an unlicensed processing plant - which had no knife steriliser or hand-washing basin. Kamran Ajaib, 27, used Y-front underpants to clean his premises, Hamza Poultry Limited in Bristol, which operated as a makeshift butcher’s, Bristol Crown Court heard yesterday. The chicken was distributed to kebab shops and  takeaway restaurants across the city - and even as far afield as Swindon, Cardiff and Swansea. Council officials raided the plant after a customer found metal wire in their takeaway chicken. Ajaib’s premises had none of the necessary food hygiene approvals or licences to work with meat. He pleaded guilty to 16 charges of failing to comply with food hygiene regulations between June 2010 and May 2011, but denied any knowledge of cutting chicken on the premises. He told a previous hearing, held at the city’s magistrate’s court last year, that the chicken arrived in boxes from European Union-regulated factories and was left in those boxes. But city council principal environmental health officer John Barrow said equipment used in meat preparation had been found during a raid on the premises, along with off-cuts of meat. Mr Barrow said council officers and police found work tables, a saw often used to cut meat, knives, and a chainmail glove - used by butchers to prevent accidental injuries while chopping meat. Open wheelie bins containing meat debris and bones were also discovered in the search. Council investigators estimated the unit processed ‘in excess of 20 to 30 tons a week’ of chicken. Hygiene issue: The court heard that the pants were clean and came from a next door business, which had a surplus of old stock, and had been used as cleaning cloths at the chicken plant . Dirty gloves: The chicken was distributed to takeaway restaurants and kebab shops across Bristol and even as far afield as Swindon, Cardiff and Swansea . The court was also shown a photograph of a box of meat with a pair of underpants draped over it. It heard that the pants were clean and came from a next door business, which had a surplus of old stock, and had been used as cleaning cloths at the chicken plant. Bristol City Council successfully applied for an order from magistrates to destroy more than four tons of chicken seized in a raid on the unit in May last year. Mr Barrow said a member of the public complained to the council after finding a piece of metal wire in a chicken takeaway. A council probe into the takeaway’s suppliers led them to Hamza Poultry. From mobile phones and receipts seized in the raid they realised the meat was being distributed across the South West to what were described in court as ‘KFC clones and kebab shops’. Needing cleaning: Bristol City Council successfully applied for an order from magistrates to destroy more than four tons of chicken seized in a raid on the unit in May last year . Premises: Hamza Poultry Limited in Bristol, from which the chicken was distributed around the South West . Asked what the premises needed to comply with safety standards, Mr Barrow said it lacked washbasins by work areas, a knife steriliser and any kind of safety management system. 'It doesn’t matter whether this meat is fit for human consumption or not. It is simply because they have not got the right licences in place' Kate Burnham, Bristol City Council . Kate Burnham, who brought the application to destroy the meat on behalf of the council, said: ‘It doesn’t matter whether this meat is fit for human consumption or not. It is simply because they have not got the right licences in place.’ Ajaib told the earlier court hearing that he had stepped in at short notice to help his family, taking over the business from a brother who had been ‘locked up’ some months before the raid. He said he had not known he needed a licence, and that the equipment he had on the site had come from a butcher who owed him money. Ajaib faces a possible jail term when sentenced next month.","Kamran Ajaib, 27, operated Hamza Poultry Limited as makeshift butcher's .

A singer has admitted carrying out a glass attack that resulted in her band being kicked off the X Factor. Girl-group Quantro reached the boot camp stages of the competition before bosses threw them out after band member Lucie Slater was accused of attacking her ex-boyfriend William Scott Aitken. Horrifying photos taken in hospital of his injuries showed several cuts across his nose and cheek and the right-hand side was swollen due to a large gash. Scroll down for video . Attacked: Scott Aitkin, who performs as a DJ under the name 'Scottie Hollywood' was the victim of a glass attack by Lucie Slater, in June this year . Sentenced: Slater, 21, left, of Ryton, Gateshead, was charged with wounding with intent, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, after the  incident at Mr Aitken's right, home in Northumberland . Slater, 21, of Ryton, Gateshead, was charged with wounding with intent, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, after the incident at Mr Aitken's home in Northumberland. Before her trial was due to start at Newcastle Crown Court  today she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of unlawful wounding, which has a maximum sentence of five years behind bars. Her barrister Peter Schofield said Slater accepts 'at the point this took place she had a glass in her hand.' Axed: At the time of the attack former fellow member Hannah Gray said her and the rest of Quantro were left devastated by the decision of the X Factor bosses to remove the whole group from the show . Mr Schofield asked for the curfew condition of Slater's bail to be lifted to allow her to do night time promotional work. Mr Recorder Toby Hedworth QC agreed to lift the condition and extended her bail with residence requirements and orders to stay away from Mr Aitken and his place of work. The judge warned 'all of the court sentencing options' will be open to him when Slater is back in court next month. And he added: 'Were there to be any further difficulty in the period before Sentence is imposed it would have a significant bearing on the eventual outcome of the case.' Admittance: Before her trial was due to start at Newcastle Crown Court today she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of unlawful wounding, which has a maximum sentence of five years behind bars . The judge ordered a pre-sentence report from the probation service to provide him with more information on Slater and her background before sentence is imposed. Mr Aitken, a DJ at the Tiger Tiger bar in Newcastle, needed medical treatment after the attack in June. At the time of the attack former fellow member Hannah Gray said her and the rest of the band were left devastated by the decision of the X Factor bosses to remove the whole group from the show. The 20-year-old from Ponteland, Northumberland, said: 'We got fantastic comments from the judges and we are just heartbroken. 'We have worked so hard to get to where we are. We can't thank people enough for the support we've been given and that's why the band is going to carry on.' After being disqualified from the show, the band tweeted: 'We'd like to thank everybody so so much from the bottom of our hearts for the support everyone gave us. 'It meant everything and will strive us to continue what we love. Keep your dreams alive xx.' The group, made up of Carly Ahmad, Emily Dyson, Hannah Gray and Lucie, impressed crowds outside the X Factor auditions with their rendition of Lloyd's Dedication To My Ex. An X Factor spokesman said the group could not continue as a three-piece as it was too far into the competition, but that they could re-audition for the show next year.

Nick Boles has fired a shot at the Liberal Democrats, warning that their push for green energy should not be used as an 'excuse' to impose the eyesores in the countryside . Planners should not ‘ride roughshod’ over local communities in a rush to approve and build windfarms, the planning minister has said. Nick Boles has fired a shot at the Liberal Democrats, warning that their push for green energy should not be used as an ‘excuse’ to impose the eyesores in the countryside. In a letter to the department for Energy and Climate Change, Mr Boles warns that the spread of onshore windfarms is ‘bitterly resented’ by affected communities. Mr Boles issued his broadside in a formal response to the Energy Department’s public consultation on the future of wind energy. He has very pointedly sided with energy minister John Hayes, who is campaigning to block the approval of future onshore wind farms, against Lib Dem energy secretary Ed Davey, who insists that they are a cornerstone of Britain’s renewable energy policy. In his letter Mr Boles says the government should do more to support local communities fighting planning battles over the location of windfarms. ‘We should be working with communities rather than seemingly riding roughshod over their concerns,’ he writes. ‘Proposals allowed on appeal by planning inspectors can be bitterly resented. ‘Wind farms are not appropriate in all settings.’ Mr Boles’ Department for Communities and Local Government has pioneered plans for local communities to be compensated with new facilities if they accept renewable energy developments. Mr Boles has previously called for no windfarm to be built within 1.4 miles of people's homes. In a letter to the department for Energy and Climate Change, Mr Boles warns that the spread of onshore windfarms is 'bitterly resented' by affected communities . But his latest intervention is significant since it forms an official response to the consultation at DECC. The Coalition split over green energy has led to furious exchanges over the past few months. The Lib Dems say windfarms are vital to ensure that Britain hits its green energy target to generate 15 per cent of energy from renewable resources by 2020. But senior Tories say that target will be easily met with windfarms ‘already in the pipeline’ - those with planning permission or awaiting approval. The Lib Dems reacted with irritation to Mr Boles’ letter. A source close to Mr Davey said: ‘No one ever said we wanted to ride roughshod over anyone.’","Boles: Lib Dems' push for green energy should not be used as an ‘excuse’ to impose eyesores in countryside .

A revolutionary new treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) has had its global launch in the UK. Wet AMD is a disease that causes blindness in the  centre of the eye and  affects 420,000 Britons. The condition develops when abnormal blood vessels cluster under the macula – the part  of the eye responsible for detailed central vision – and leak, so obscuring vision. New hope: A treatment called Oraya therapy could help improve the condition of diseased eyes . Wet AMD is the most serious form of AMD because without treatment sight can deteriorate within days. Standard treatment involves an injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) into the eye, which prevents further blood vessels developing. The procedure needs to be carried out between every one and three months and only prevents vision from worsening. The non-invasive Oraya therapy is a one-time treatment and can improve the vision of a diseased eye. It involves a low-dose but precisely focused X-ray beam on the macula to inhibit the growth of blood vessels. The ray also has the benefit of reducing inflammation and scarring. Each session takes 20 minutes. ‘Each time the vessels leak,  it triggers inflammation, which leads to scarring of  the macula,’ says Mr Andrew Luff, consultant ophthalmic surgeon at the Optegra Specialist Eye Hospital group, which offers the treatment. ‘This is a giant leap forward for those suffering with Wet AMD,’ says Luff. ‘Oraya will dramatically improve the quality of life  for the patients.’ Although not available on the NHS, private treatment is available from £5,145.","Non-invasive Oraya therapy inhibits blood vessel growth - reducing inflammation and scarring of the eye .

At a camp in Maaret Ikhwan, near Idlib, recruits are trained in combat situations as the rebels try to fashion a disciplined fighting force. Idlib has been an opposition stronghold since the Syrian civil war broke out against Assad's government nearly two years ago. Last week footage emerged of a recent MiG air strike by the Syrian Army as it continued to pound the town. Scroll down for video . Standing up to the state: Syrian rebels attend a training session in Maaret Ikhwan, near Idlib, Syria . The training is part of an attempt to transform the rag-tag rebel groups into a disciplined fighting force . Idlib has been an opposition stronghold since the Syrian civil war broken out against Assad's government nearly two years ago . Today, clashes between Syrian rebels and an armed Palestinian group loyal to President Assad raged inside a Damascus refugee camp as opposition fighters pushed deeper into the capital, activists said. The NBC network meanwhile announced that its chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel and his production team were released unharmed after being held captive for five days inside Syria by an 'unknown group.' The rebels fighting to topple Assad's regime have made significant tactical advances in the past weeks, capturing air bases and military installations in and around Damascus. Their offensive in the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk in southern Damascus, which began Friday, is aimed at driving the pro-government Palestinian gunmen out of the camp, which would be another blow to Assad and his loyalists. When the revolt against Assad's rule began in March 2011, the half-million-strong Palestinian community in Syria tried to stay on the sidelines of the conflict. But as the civil war deepened, most Palestinians backed the rebels, though some groups - such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command - have been fighting on the government side.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights meanwhile said the violence in Yarmouk is forcing an exodus of Palestinian refugees and Syrians who came to the camp in past weeks to escape violence elsewhere in the city. The Observatory relies on reports from activists on the ground. Camp residents said several mortar rounds landed inside Yarmouk and gunfire has echoed around the area. By Tuesday afternoon, the Syrian military deployed several tanks along camp's main entrance. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety. They said there were no Syrian government troops in the camp and that most of the fighting was between rebels and gunmen from the PFLP-GC. The group is led by Ahmed Jibril, Assad's longtime ally.

Syrian pro-government Al Watan newspaper said Tuesday the army could be preparing an operation 'to cleanse the Yarmouk camp of gunmen.' On Monday, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem claimed the clashes at the camp were triggered by the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra group, which was designated by the Obama administration a terrorist organization last week. Al-Moallem warned Palestinians inside the camp not to harbor terrorist fighters. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in Syria said it was 'gravely concerned' for the Palestinian refugees in Yarmouk who 'have experienced particularly intense armed engagements involving the use of heavy weapons and aircraft,' UNRWA said in a statement.

There are also 'waves of significant displacement' as about 150,000 Palestinian refugees in Yarmouk and thousands of Syrian residents of the camp 'scramble to seek safety amid continued fighting,' the agency said. UNRWA is housing over 2,600 displaced persons in its facilities and Damascus area schools, and the number is growing rapidly, the agency said in a statement that was posted on its website late Monday. On Tuesday, an UNRWA official told The Associated Press that the situation in Yarmouk is 'chaotic' and movement of the agency's staff inside the camp has been restricted. Civilians continue to leave the camp, with some heading to UNRWA installations around Damascus. Others are fleeing to other Syrian cities and many are headed to the Lebanon-Syrian border, said Sami Mshasha, spokesman for the agency. Taking aim: The rebels look out over Idlib, Syria, as part of the training role-play . There were no immediate reports of casualties from Tuesday's fighting. At least eight people were killed in an airstrike on Yarmouk on Sunday, according to Syrian activists. U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said Monday the United States is 'deeply concerned' by reports that dozens of civilians were killed or wounded in Yarmouk as a result of aerial bombardment and fighting. The U.N. humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, who was just in Damascus meanwhile warned of a growing humanitarian crisis in Syria. The 21-month battle to bring down the Assad regime has already forced some three million Syrians from their homes, according to a new estimate, and cold, wet winter weather is making life increasingly unbearable for the displaced. Among those who left their homes are more than 500,000 who fled to neighboring countries like Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Amos told reporters Monday after briefing the U.N. Security Council on her trip that she asked the Syrian government to allow the U.N. to import fuel so the organisation can move around Syria, and to allow 10 additional international humanitarian groups to work in the country to scale-up the U.N.'s work. NBC meanwhile said that Engel and members of his production crew have been freed unharmed following a firefight at a checkpoint after five days of captivity inside Syria. NBC News said on its website that 39-year-old Engel and his team were kidnapped shortly after crossing the border from Turkey into Syria on Thursday. They were blindfolded and bound, but otherwise not physically harmed. The group was transported in the back of a truck to a location believed to be near the small town of Maarrat Misrin in northern Idlib province. On Monday, the group was being driven to a new location when the kidnappers ran into a checkpoint manned by members of the Ahrar al-Sham brigade, a Syrian rebel group. A firefight ensued, killing two of the captors, the report said. 'We are pleased to report they are safely out of the country,' NBC said in a statement. The Syrian government has made it difficult for foreign journalists and citizens to report on what is happening in Syria. Those journalists whom the regime has allowed in are tightly controlled in their movements by Information Ministry minders. Other foreign journalists sneak into Syria illegally with the help of smugglers. The kidnapping of foreigners has been rare, but as Syria descends further into chaos the abduction of Syrians has become increasingly common across many parts of the country. In related developments, Russia's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that two Russians were kidnapped alongside an Italian in Syria and that their captors have asked for a ransom for their release. The three, who worked at a Syrian steel plant, were kidnapped late Monday on the road between Tartus, where Russia has a naval base, and Homs, the ministry said in a web-posted statement. It did not specify the amount. Russia has been the key international ally of Assad, whose embattled regime is fighting rebel forces since March 2010 in a civil war that killed an estimated 40,000 people.","Recruits are trained in combat situations in Maaret Ikhwan, near Idlib .

"By . Tom Gardner and Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:11 EST, 25 June 2012 . It has been almost two years since Aesha Mohammadzai arrived in America having been brutally ortured in Afghanistan by her husband. He hacked off her nose and ears after she tried to escape their abusive forced marriage leaving her mentally traumatised and horrifically disfigured. With the move to the United States came the promise of reconstructive surgery but it has been delayed as she battles with the psychological torment of her ordeal, and of leaving her homeland for a country where she speaks very little of the language. Touching: Aesha (right) has found a close friend in Miena Arsala, the daughter of the family caring for her . Aesha is expected to undergo six . operations, over the course of the next two years, the first of which . took place on Thursday morning at Walter Reed National Military Medical . Centre in Bethesda, Maryland, CNN reported. It began the process of expanding the skin in her forward for future use in rebuilding her nose. Aesha’s treatment at the military . centre was secured by U.S. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett and his office. He said: . ‘People know we take care of wounded soldiers. ‘That's kind of an obligation; what . else could you do?' he told CNN. 'But this – you don't have to do this. It puts a real . human face on our military. How can your heart not go out to Aesha?’ The 22-year-old was accompanied to . the hospital by Mati and Jamila Arsala, a couple who have been caring . for her. They have set up a website called Aesha’s Journey where . messages of support and donations can be posted. Speaking before the operation Aesha . told the news site: ‘I'm not scared. I'm happy. I suffered a lot in my . life. Now I feel that a light comes into my life.’ The Arsala’s have a 14-year-old daughter, Miena, in whom Aesha has found a close friend. Resilient: Aesha Mohammadzai relaxes at her new home in America where she is building a new life . Miena said of her adopted sister: ‘I'm pretty sure, once she gets all her surgery, she'll have a lot of guys drooling.’ The family reported that the first operation was a success, but they have apprehensions for what is to come. Aesha will face looking far worse . before she begins to look better, and the surgeries will bring about . severe pain and discomfort. The young girl’s story was first told . by Time magazine, who published a harrowing photograph of her on the . front page, horrifying people around the world. In 2011 she won political asylum in the U.S where she had fled a year earlier. She was given a prosthetic nose, but . full plastic surgery had to be delayed because it was thought she was . still not yet emotionally stable to cope with the painful and lengthy . surgery required. Those who close to spoke of her . displaying volatile mood swings – oscillating between violent tantrums . and displaying deep affection to people around her. Beginning the surgery is a sign of just how far Aesha has come. Brave: Aisha, now 22, pictured wearing a type of prosthetic nose often used by film actors. Her nose and ears were hacked off by brutal in-laws after she was promised in marriage aged 12 . Psychologist Shiphra Bakhchi, 31, who has helped treat the 22-year-old for post-traumatic stress disorder believes the trauma of her disfigurement may have caused deeper mental scars than physical ones. ‘I really hope at some point she’ll be a functioning young lady that had a terrible trauma,’ the private practitioner told CNN. When Aesha was 12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a debt. She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to sleep in the stable with the animals. The UN estimates that nearly 90 per cent of Afghanistan's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse. When she attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were hacked off by her husband as punishment. 'When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out. In the middle of the night it felt like there was cold water in my nose. 'I opened my eyes and I couldn't even see because of all the blood,' she told CNN reporter Atia Abawi. New beginning: Before the surgery was able to begin Aisha was fitted with a prosthetic nose . Left for dead in the mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house and her father managed to get her to an American medical facility, where medics cared for her for ten weeks. They then transported Aesha to a secret shelter in Kabul and in August 2010, she was flown to the U.S. by the Grossman Burn Foundation to stay with a host family. She was taken in by a charity in New York called Women for Afghan Women who supported her and helped pay for her eduction. But Aesha soon became unhappy and her behaviour gave rise to concern. During one outburst during, she threw herself to the floor and slammed her head against the ground, grabbing at her hair and biting her fingers. Her primary guardian figure at the centre Esther Hyneman, who witnessed the tantrum said no one was able to prevent her from inflicting the injuries and they had to call 911 for help, Ms Hyneman  said during the CNN interview. Recovering: Aisha has received counselling following her traumatic experiences . Aesha was admitted to hospital for 10 days following that episode. Those who knew her said Aesha craved the close-knit family environment the centre was unable to provide. She left in December 2011, to live with with Mati Arsla and Jami Rasouli-Arsala, from Fredrick, Maryland - who are relatives of a Women for Afghan Women former board member - where she now appears to be adapting to home life. Ms Hyneman - who Aesha affectionately used to call 'grandma' - told CNN: ‘When she first came to us, she was an emotional wreck. ‘By the time she left, she was a different human being... So we’re all happy if she’s in the right place to further her development, but we miss her.’ Facing reality: Aisha's photo was on the front cover of Time Magazine in August 2010 . During the momentous few years since arriving in America, Aesha has had a prosthetic nose fitted at the non-profit humanitarian Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital in California as part of her eight-month rehabilitation. Dr Peter H Grossman said they hoped to give Aesha a more 'permanent solution', which could mean reconstructing her nose and ears using bone, tissue and cartilage from other parts of her body. Dr Grossman's wife Rebecca, the chair of the Grossman Burn Foundation, said Aesha was just one of the thousands of women who are treated with appalling harshness. She said: 'Aesha is reminded of that enslavement every time she looks in the mirror. But there are still times she can laugh. And at that moment you see her teenage spirit escaping a body that has seen a lifetime of injustice.'","Aesha Mohammadzai was horrifically disfigured and left for dead for trying to flee abusive forced marriage .

The first picture of the transsexual beauty queen who made international headlines after her dismissal and subsequent reinstatement from Miss Universe Canada has emerged - and she's a 13-year-old boy called Walter. Pictured with a blonde bob as a Grade 8 student at Vancouver's Killarney secondary school, Jenna Talackova, 23, was then known as Walter Page Talackova. Jenna, who learned this week she is now eligible to compete in the Miss Universe Canada pageant after originally being thrown out last month for being born a boy, made international headlines after it was revealed she lied about her natural gender on her application form. Scroll down for video . Transgender Miss Universe Canada contestant Jenna Talackova as Grade eight student Walter Page Talackova . Miss Talackova will be interviewed about the saga by veteran TV journalist Barbara Walters, set to be broadcast on ABC in the US on Monday . Ms Talackova talked about the saga in an exclusive interview with ABC journalist Barbara Walters and said her mother still calls her Walter. In the interview, which will be aired on ABC's 20/20 tonight, she said: 'As soon as I was conscious, I just always . knew that I was not what they were saying.  It wasn’t right. I thought . that I was in the wrong body.' Ms Talackova was thrown out of the . pageant, owned by billionaire Donald Trump, after organisers learned she . had undergone surgery to become a woman. He was later criticized for having the 'natural born female' rule at all. She revealed to Barbara Walters that though the gender . reassignment surgery at the age of 19 and subsequent hormone treatments were intense and painful, it was ultimately 'rewarding'. 'It was terribly painful, but seeing something on your body for that . long and not being able to look at myself in the mirror because I . couldn’t stand seeing the other part, it was actually very rewarding, . too,' she said. First interview: Jenna Talackova talks to Barbara Walters on tonight's 20/20 about her transgender surgery and always feeling different . Confused: Jenna said that even when she was a young boy called Walter, she felt like she was in the wrong body . The Trump organization later released a statement saying that pageant . rules had 'been modernized to ensure this type of issue does not occur . again'. Jenna now wants to use her situation to help others: 'I feel like the universe, the creator just put me in this position as . an advocate. And now it’s like this, and I’ll take that . position. 'If it’s helping anybody else, my story and my actions, then I . feel great about it.' Her mother told Barbara that she had always wanted a daughter, but when Jenna was born she thought, 'Ok that's it I guess. I have four boys. But now I have four sons and a daughter.' Classmates recalled how Jenna's looks and behaviour sparked intrigue about her gender even back in their high school days. With a slender frame and effeminate mannerisms, she stuck out. 'It was very obvious,' Teruko Walker told The Vancouver Sun, recalling her looks and behaviour when she was in her early teens. 'It wasn't like she looked like a boy, but acted like a girl. She very much looked like a female,' said Walker, who was in Grade 11 at the high school at the time. Acceptance: Jenna Talackova's mother said she always wanted a daughter after having having four boys but said now she has three sons and one daughter . She has been a veteran beauty pageant competitor since undergoing sexual reassignment surgery at the age of 19 and has competed in a Miss Universe competition before. Ms Talackova's story sparked outrage on social networking sites including Twitter after people claimed the organisation was being discriminatory. More than 20,000 people signed a virtual petition on Change.org demanding that she be re-instated. She had already reached the finals of the Miss Vancouver pageant before officials stepped in and banned her from the competition. The only requirement stated on the Miss Universe Canada website is that to enter, women must be a Canadian citizen and between the ages of 18 and 27. The application form makes no mention of rules regarding sexual reassignment surgery. Ms Talackova's case was taken on by celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred who is famous for representing clients including a string of Tiger Woods' ex-lovers and Nicole Brown Simpson's family during the O.J. Simpsopn trial. In a YouTube video interview, Ms Talackova said she knew she was a female at the age of four and began hormone therapy ten years later. 'I regard myself as a woman with a history,' Ms Talackova says, winking to the camera. Transgender Miss Universe Canada finalist, Jenna Talackova, of Vancouver, was disqualified from the competition before being re-instated this week . Ms Talackova's family, who live in east Vancouver and the Northern British Columbia, have supported her throughout her transition. Vancouver-born Talackova made it to the final with 64 other contestants before learning of the organisation's U-turn last Friday. But she has another shot at being crowned winner of the contest, which will be announced on May 19 in Toronto next month. She could then go on and represent Canada in the international Miss Universe Pageant later this year. Mr Trump overturned the decision to dismiss the Canadian after a wave of publicity surrounding the move. Ms Allred claimed this week that questions should be posed to Mr Trump's organisation about the rule rather than focusing on Ms Talackova's gender, pointing to the letter 'F' for female on her passport. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .","Transgender beauty contestant who caused international headlines was a boy called Walter Page Talackova .

House Speaker John Boehner has said today that he ‘can’t imagine’ his conservative views on gay marriage will ever shift, even if he had a son who was gay. The Ohio Republican told ABC News’ Martha Raddatz for ‘This Week’ that he could not possibly see a situation where his views would change. Rep. Boehner’s firm stance goes directly against the remarkable about-face of fellow Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who publically said he supports gay marriage after his own son came out.

'Change of heart:' A family Christmas card shows Sen. Rob Portman and his wife, Jane, with their children, from left, Jed, 22, Will, 21, and Sally, 18. Sen. Portman announced he would embrace gay marriage in a shocking reversal on the issue . Speaking on ABC News’ ‘This Week,’ Rep. Boehner said: ‘Rob’s a great friend and a long-time ally.’ He went on to explain in the exclusive interview: ‘(But) I believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman… It’s what I grew up with. It’s what I believe. It’s what my church teaches me. ‘And I can’t imagine that position would ever change.’ Traditional: Boehner, R-Ohio, said he still believes marriage is between a man and a woman . Ms Raddatz pushed the speaker to explore if there ever could be a situation, like that of Sen. Portman, where his views would shift. ‘Listen,’ Rep. Boehner responded. ‘I think that Rob can make up his own mind, take his own position. 'But I’ve made clear my position.’ Sen. Portman, who was on former presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s short list of running mates in the past election, made the surprising announcement on CNN last Thursday, as well as in an op-ed in the Columbus Dispatch. Doing so made him the first Republican senator to publically embrace the right of same-sex couples to marry. His son Will, a 21-year-old student at Yale University, came out to him two years ago. During the interview, Rep Boehner talked about striking a possible ‘grand-bargain,’ a measure to address the $16 trillion in U.S. debt and heralded the president’s recent efforts to promote bi-partisanship. But in the speaker’s mind, ‘the talk about raising revenue is over,’ adding that President Obama already raised taxes, effective January 1. ‘It’s time to deal with the spending problem’ and address the ‘looming’ debt crisis, he said. Old pals: When asked if Boehner trusts President Obama, he responded: 'Absolutely' When Ms Raddatz asked if he trusted the president, Rep. Boehner said: ‘Absolutely.’ ‘The president and I, as I have made clear, have a very good relationship,’ he said. ‘We’re open with each other.‘We’re honest with each other. But we’re trying to bridge some big differences.’ During the interview, Rep. Boehner touched upon several other hot-button issues, including gun control, the recent CPAC conference, and the election of Argentinian Pope Francis, the first South American pope in history.

Labour’s deputy leader revealed she has read the erotic bestseller for ‘research purposes’ but was left cold by its tales of sado-masochism. In an extraordinary passage in her speech closing Labour’s party conference, Ms Harman told delegates most women want is ‘not a man who ties you to the bed, but one who unstacks the dishwasher’. Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said Fifty Shades of Grey was 'unrealistic' Ms Harman has been married to Jack Dromey, a former union official and now fellow MP, for 30 years. A staunch campaigner for women’s rights and sexual equality, she told party activists that in her new role as Shadow Culture Secretary she was always asked what she is reading. ‘Just the other week, I had an awkward moment when a journalist asked me if I'd read ""that"" book.

A terrified teenage girl predicted her own death on Facebook just minutes before she lost her life at the hands of a drunken driver, a court heard today. Kayleigh Lawrie, 14, pleaded to be allowed to get out of the car being driven by her father's friend because she was so scared by his ‘Formula One’ style driving. Kayleigh, who had already posted a message on Facebook saying ‘I think I’m going to die’, was told by her father Scott Lawrie not to be so stupid. Kayleigh Lawrie, 14, asked to get out of the car and wrote on Facebook 'I think I've going to die xx luv you all'. She was a passenger in a car being driven by HGV driver Steven Hayter who was twice over the legal limit. Moments later the driver Steven Hayter - who was twice over the drink-drive limit - lost control of his Renault Clio on a country road near Kayleigh’s home in Willoughby, Lincolnshire. He was attempting to retrieve a cigarette he had dropped in the foot well. The car skewed across the road into a ditch and then flew 60ft through the air before crashing down. Kayleigh, who was on the back seat, died instantly. A 13-year-old boy in the car suffered a fractured skull and facial injuries. Lincoln Crown Court was told that Hayter had been on a seven-hour drinking session the previous night and then after a few hours sleep drank wine before setting out on his journey to visit a bank in the resort of Skegness. Andrew Scott, prosecuting, said that on the night before Hayter drank four pints of lager in his village local before driving to the nearby town of Alford where he had another four pints and several double vodkas and coke. Steven Hayter, who was twice over the drink-drive limit and was jailed for six years . Then, during the early hours he had a large glass of wine before downing a second large glass half an hour before setting off with Scott Lawrie, 37, and the two teenagers. Hayter twice almost went off the road within minutes of setting off and then forced an oncoming pick-up onto the verge when he took a bend on the wrong side of the road. Mr Scott said ‘At Alford the car stopped. The teenagers remained inside. Kayleigh posted a message on her Facebook page saying ‘I think I’m going to die. xx. luv you all’. ‘Kayleigh told him (Hayter) at the time she posted the message because she was scared.’ Hayter then called at a filling station and clipped the central pump island before reversing back and almost hitting another vehicle. He tried to fill up with diesel instead of petrol. Mr Scott said ‘While the defendant paid for his petrol the boy and Kayleigh told Scott Lawrie they wanted to get out of the car because they were so frightened. Scott Lawrie told them not to be so stupid. ‘The defendant returned to his car. When he drove away from the petrol station he accelerated away at a speed so great that his wheels span.’ ‘He started driving like a Formula One driver cutting up all the corners. The 13-year-old boy’s attention was focused on the speedometer which he read as 65 mph. As the vehicle reached the ditch there were screams and then the impact.’ Hayter himself suffered injuries and was taken to hospital. Tests taken more than four hours after the collision showed he was almost twice over the limit with a reading of 147 mgs of alcohol per 100 mls of blood. Hayter, a professional HGV driver, of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, admitted causing death by careless driving while over the limit. He was jailed for six years and disqualified from driving for two years. Recorder Timothy Spencer QC told him ‘Kayleigh lost her life because of your appalling driving. This was a wholly avoidable and wholly unnecessary tragedy. ‘The only explanation for what happened must be drink. Your alcohol level must have been extremely high indeed. I am not convinced about the necessity for the journey at all. ‘Chillingly Kayleigh realised just how bad your driving was and before you left the petrol station had already sent a Facebook message which foretold of the tragedy to come.' David Eager, defending, said Hayter had been left full of remorse. ‘He accepts he was solely responsible for Kayleigh’s death. That will lie heavily on his conscience for the rest of his life.’ Kayleigh’s mother Charlotte Buxton, in a tribute to her daughter, said ‘Kayleigh was a bright, happy, bubbly and loving 14-year-old, who lived life to the full. She loved animals, which included her rag doll cat, Sapphire, and her dog, Luna. ‘Kayleigh was strong-willed and knew what she wanted out of life. Kayleigh loved fashion and wasn’t afraid to experiment with her looks, although it often got her into trouble with school. She was good at French and loved cooking, especially cup cakes. ‘Kayleigh will be missed and loved always by all who knew her.’","Kayleigh Lawrie, 14, died when travelling in car of HGV driver Steven Hayter .

Channel 4 said later that there was no implication that anything had happened with the child, who was also clothed, in the comedy, to be shown late at night. It said that the joke was on the female character being so drunk that she could not remember the night. A spokesman said: 'London Irish is a new comedy series based on a group of 20-something Irish friends living in London always on the lookout for ‘the craic’ that will screen on Channel 4 later in the year. 'The clip, shown at Channel 4’s programme launch press event today, briefly introduced the characters as they woke facing exaggerated comedic scenarios playing on what had happened the night before. 'The joke is directed at the character’s inability, because of drink, to remember the night before.' The broadcaster’s chief creative officer Jay Hunt said London Irish was 'standout comedy'. London Irish features Sinead Keenan, of Being Human fame, and Kerr Logan from Game of Thrones . She added: 'We have a role to play in pushing the boundaries. It’s not pre-watershed.' London Irish is written by Irishwoman Lisa McGee and is described on the broadcaster's website as being about 'a hard-drinking, hard-living ex-pat community of Northern Irish twenty-somethings who live in London'. It continues: 'For these four friends it's not easy navigating their way through London life, particularly when they’re too drunk to know where they’re going, or remember where they’ve been. 'They have rubbish jobs, no money, and are surrounded by English people. In fact there's only one thing worse than living in London with the English – and that's living in Ireland with the Irish.' * Channel 4 also confirmed at its season launch that it will be broadcasting proceedings from a Scottish court following three years of negotiations. The broadcaster has been given access to the case of Nat Fraser, who was convicted for the second time of murdering his wife Arlene.","New comedy London Irish features the controversial clip .

Calls were growing last night for the embattled head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, to quit . Calls were growing last night for the embattled head of the NHS to quit after he admitted misleading MPs over a whistleblower. Sir David Nicholson – described by critics as the Man With No Shame – received a letter from former trust boss Gary Walker four years ago raising concerns about patient care. But on Monday Sir David told a Commons committee that Mr Walker ‘didn’t identify himself as a whistleblower ... nor did he raise with me any issues of patient safety’. Yesterday the NHS chief executive issued a humiliating correction after the original letter, which contradicted Sir David’s account, emerged. The admission is damning for Sir David as it suggests Mr Walker, who broke a £500,000 gagging clause to reveal poor standards of care and a ‘culture of fear’, may not have been offered adequate protection as a whistleblower. Sir David’s climbdown came on the same day that a leaked letter emerged revealing he has asked senior managers awaiting ‘substantial’ redundancy payouts to wait six months before reapplying for NHS jobs. One of the aims, says Sir David, is to avoid ‘reputational damage’ to the health service. The letter will be seen by his critics as further evidence that Sir David is presiding over a culture of secrecy within the NHS as he effectively urges managers to keep quiet about their pay-offs. He is already facing calls to step down over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly. Yesterday he wrote to Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge to ‘correct one specific point of detail’. He wrote: ‘In response to a question from Stephen Barclay MP about Gary Walker, I said that when he initially wrote to me, I thought that he did not identify himself as a whistleblower. ‘I have now had the opportunity to review the correspondence and would like to confirm that when Gary Walker wrote to me in July 2009 he did indeed ask to be considered as a whistleblower.’ He continued: ‘However, I would reassure you that the action I took at the time in response to Gary’s letter was appropriate. ‘As I explained yesterday, I immediately commissioned a comprehensive independent investigation into the allegations that had been made.’ Mr Walker, former head of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, was sacked in 2010, allegedly for swearing in a meeting. Cure the NHS protestors campaigning for the resignation of Sir David. A leaked letter emerged revealing he has asked senior managers awaiting 'substantial' redundancy payouts to wait six months before reapplying for NHS jobs . He maintains the real reason was his refusal to prioritise waiting list targets over emergency care for patients. Tory MP Charlotte Leslie said it was now ‘impossible’ for Sir David to remain in his post. She wrote a letter to the Prime Minister telling him Sir David should go ‘with all speed’. Insisting she had the support of 60 other MPs, she wrote: ‘I am deeply concerned that the man who currently leads the largest employer in the country has not only overseen a culture that has damaged our NHS, but has now given a false account to a Select Committee in this way. ‘Therefore there are serious questions of integrity to be answered. ‘If, however, Sir David was really aware of none of this, it draws such questions over his competence and memory that he cannot be a man to oversee crucial reforms.’ Yesterday Mr Walker contradicted Sir David’s account when he gave evidence to MPs. In his 2009 letter, he wrote: ‘I assume the Department of Health has a policy on whistleblowing and would therefore like this letter to be considered in that context.’ He also mentions the ‘significant risk to patients’ he believes was raised by attempts to force him out, and warns: ‘This is the sort of behaviour that gave the country a Mid Staffordshire.’ The letter also described a ‘culture of avoiding accountability and blaming and harassing others’. Steve Barclay, who sits on the committee said: ‘He misled a Commons committee after being specifically asked about this twice. On Monday, Sir David was criticised by MPs over his NHS expenses. Last year he racked up £50,000 in claims, the cost of employing two nurses for a year, on top of his £211,000 salary . ‘He may have been woefully unprepared – or not expecting written evidence to catch him out.’ In response to Mr Walker’s letter, Sir David commissioned the Goodwin Report into ‘allegations of bullying and harassment’ at the hospital trust. All staff were cleared of the allegations and Sir David said they ‘acted appropriately throughout’. Last night Mr Walker said: ‘He lied when he said I was not a whistleblower, and that my concerns were investigated as I raised concerns about patient suffering and they were not investigated.’ Earlier he told MPs: ‘If people had put allegations like I misled a select committee and that I had lied... I would expect to be suspended and investigated.’ Anyone judged to have lied to a Commons committee could face jail after being charged with ‘contempt of the House’. Sir David is backed by David Cameron and Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt but insiders believe he will resign within months. On Monday, Sir David was criticised by MPs over his NHS expenses.

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 19:17 EST, 19 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:14 EST, 20 March 2013 . £4.8bn move: The Chancellor George Osborne will agree to unlock billions in child trust funds and allow parents to transfer their investments into more generous junior ISAs . The savings of more than six million children are to be rescued and the remaining elderly victims of one of Britain’s biggest financial scandals compensated in a twin Budget boost for young and old. Chancellor George Osborne will today agree to unlock £4.8billion in child trust funds and allow parents to transfer their investments into more generous Junior ISAs. His move follows a long-running Money Mail campaign. The Chancellor will also use his Budget statement to announce that thousands of elderly people who lost up to half their life savings when Equitable Life came close to collapse a decade ago will receive compensation. Policyholders over the age of 60 who bought annuities from the world’s oldest insurer before September 1 1992, who have previously been excluded from a repayment scheme, will receive up to £10,000 each. The Chancellor’s fourth Budget will be delivered against a grim economic backdrop, with flatlining growth putting his deficit-reduction plans under great strain. He is expected to scrap a planned 3p fuel duty rise due in the autumn, and increase the threshold for income tax to £10,000, benefiting 24million basic rate taxpayers. Treasury sources told the Daily Mail that one key move to boost savings will be an announcement that funds will be allowed to be transferred from child trust funds to Junior ISAs. Many parents and grandparents have contributed thousands of pounds to child trust funds on the back of promises from the last Government that they would prove ideal long-term investments for their child. But Coalition austerity measures meant the £250 being paid to every newborn to start a fund was stopped and the trust funds scrapped, to be replaced by Junior ISAs with no state contribution. Pressure: The Chancellor's move to rescue the savings of more than six million children follows a long-running campaign by Money Mail . Those with a child trust fund – children born between September 1, 2002, and January 2, 2011 – have not been entitled to open a Junior ISA or transfer their cash to one. But there have been growing concerns that the £4.8billion in the funds could be condemned to years of poor returns. Experts have warned that investment firms no longer able to attract new customers have little incentive to put their best managers in charge, while banks and building societies have paid derisory interest rates. Crucially, the rates paid on Junior ISAs are much better, and there are thousands of funds to choose from. Mr Osborne will announce a 12-week consultation on how to allow transfers of funds from child trust fund accounts into Junior ISAs. These transfers could be voluntary or mandatory. The Chancellor will also extend compensation for Equitable Life policyholders – the subject of another Daily Mail campaign. Up to a million victims lost out when Equitable Life closed to new business. Victims: Mr Osborne will also extend compensation for Equitable Life policyholders who lost money when the firm collapsed in 2000 . The Government was obliged to pay compensation to some policyholders following a series of scathing judgements. Parliamentary ombudsman Ann Abraham concluded there were ten instances of maladministration between 1998 and 2001 at the Department of Trade and Industry, the Government Actuary Department and the Financial Services Authority, which contributed to the firm’s collapse. Currently, policyholders who bought a with-profits annuity from Equitable Life before September 1, 1992 are not included in a compensation scheme announced in 2010. Campaigners have asked that a specific group of 9,000 elderly policyholders should be included. Now, those over the age of 60 will get £5,000, with an additional £5,000 for those in receipt of Pension Credit.","Chancellor to unlock £4.8bn in child trust funds in Budget statement .

Amber Jackson, 19, was partying with friends when they dared her to pose for a picture in the toddler seat. She climbed into the metal-framed chair but her legs became wedged forcing her to call emergency services after developing severe pins and needles. When a prank goes wrong: Amber Jackson started to develop severe pins and needles after she got stuck in the chair . Firefighters used specialist cutting equipment to free Amber, who was initially unable to stand up because of blood loss in her legs. Amber, of Hove, East Sussex, said: 'People have been saying they think I'm stupid but I was drunk. 'I do not think it was funny that fire engines were called and I do feel bad. 'But when I was that drunk I did not think about the consequences or what would happen. 'I thought my friends would get me out. They tried pulling it but I just couldn't get out. 'I do wish I didn't do it but when you look back it is funny.' This could be awkward: Amber Jackson climbed into the tiny chair at a house party but unfortunately got stuck . Crews were called to a property in Hove at 11.45pm on Sunday and the rescue took about 15 minutes. After being released Amber, who is unemployed, needed help standing up as the circulation to her legs had been limited. She said: 'I phoned the ambulance at first as I did not know who I needed and they told me to phone back for the fire. 'They had to cut it off as my leg was swelling up. 'I don't normally get stuck in things, although I did get my hand stuck in a jam jar the next day. 'At least I could get out the jam jar; I couldn't get out of the high chair.' Mark Rist, head of operations at East Sussex Fire and Rescue, put the incident down to 'youthful exuberance'. 'She was quite clearly stuck in and was not going to get without the help of fire crews,' he said. 'She was reported to be having a party and it was all quite chirpy. It probably came about out of youthful exuberance. 'She was stuck for some time and they did not have the tools to deal with it. 'We're certainly not classifying it as a hoax call.' Standard fire brigade call-outs cost £250 per hour but Mr Rist said the cost of this is 'minimal'. He said: 'There is a full-time cost of being on duty anyway. 'Crews were not diverted away from any other call and at that time on a Sunday a night they would not be doing any training.' But some locals criticised Miss Jackson for wasting public funds. Mick Hepworth wrote on a local website said: 'I hope she's sent a hefty bill from East Sussex Fire and Rescue for wasting time.'","Amber Jackson was partying with friends when she climbed into the seat .

A would-be University of Central Florida gunman had a checklist in his dorm room that described how he would carry out a campus massacre. James Oliver Seevakumaran's list began with him getting prepared by drinking heavily, included pulling the fire alarm to send all of the students in his dorm outside and ended with the words 'good luck + give them hell.' However, Seevakumaran never carried out his plan. After he pulled the fire alarm on Monday, he shot himself in the head. Scroll down for video . Tense: The officer who burst through James Oliver Seevakumaran's dorm room door found him dead at the foot of his bed after he committed suicide . The officer checks the students pulse before backing out of the room to ensure that the crime scene is not disturbed . Campus police released a helmet camera video from one of the officers who discovered Seevakumaran lying dead at the foot of his bed . 'Is he dead,' the officer with the camera asks. 'Yup, we gotta take a pulse,' responds the officer who had burst through Seevakumaran's door moments earlier. He holsters his pistol, bends down and puts his fingers on the student's neck. Would-be killer: UCF student James Oliver Seevakumaran was planning a campus killing spree before killing himself, cops said today . The officers then back out of the room and wait, presumably for their superiors to secure the crime scene. On the floor are a .45-caliber handgun and a semiautomatic .22-caliber rifle made to look like German assault rifle. Detectives later found hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a backpack filled with improvised explosives and weapons training videos. Police believe Seevakumaran might have been preparing for a Virginia Tech-like campus shooting and had pulled the fire alarm to get the students outside before his attack. Authorities hailed Seevakumaran's roommate as a hero after he called 911 to report that Seevakumaran was armed with a rifle. Arabo 'BK' Babakhani says that he was the man who called police after his roommate, James Oliver Seevakumaran had just pulled a fire alarm, and raised a gun to Babakhani's face just after midnight on Monday. At a press conference on Monday evening, UCF Police Chief Richard Beary said that Babakhani's call, combined with the quick response time of UCF officers, 'may have changed [Seevakumaran's] ability to think quickly on his feet.' Pulling the fire alarm was the first step of an elaborate campus massacre plot by Seevakumaran, police have said, but as officers approached, he shot himself in the head in his bedroom. There, cops found Seevakumaran's body, two guns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a backpack filled with improvised explosives. Babakhani told the UCF student newspaper Knightly News that he darted into his bedroom and called 911. He told the paper: 'I got away from the door in case he barred into it. I crouched in front of my chair in case he fired into the door. I crouched in front of my chest of [drawers] in case he fired into a wall... I just didnt know where he was gonna fire.' Babakhani also described Seevakumaran . as a loner, and said isn't sure he and his roommate ever locked eyes . before pointing an assault rifle at him. He . told the paper: 'I don’t know if he’s got any family. I've never heard . him talk on his cell phone or I don't know if he’s got any family. I . don’t know if he’s got any friends cause I've never seen them.' Babakhani added in the interview: 'For Thanksgiving... he didn't invite anyone. He just cooked a whole Thanksgiving meal for himself.' Knockoff: The rifle found in the gunman's apartment is was a GSG-522 a cheap, .22-caliber imitation of a German assault rifle . Death on campus: Cops investigating a report of a man with a gun found the body of Seevakumaran after he had shot himself in the head . Shooting: University of Central Florida police block off a street near the Tower 1 dorm after explosive devices were found while investigating a suicide in the dorm . Plotter: Seevakumaran's roommate described the 30-year-old as a loner, who once cooked an entire Thanksgiving meal for himself . As police investigated, they found writings in Seevakumaran's room that detailed a plan of attack. A list found along with his dead body included getting drunk at a bar near campus before pulling the fire alarm. Beary says the final item was 'give them hell.' About 500 students were evacuated from the dorm on the Orlando campus after the fire alarm was pulled at about 12:21am, Beary said. Beary added that Seevakumaran had not . yet paid his school fees for this semester, and a process had begun to . kick him out of the dorm. He . had no prior disciplinary record at UCF, but he was arrested in 2006 . for misuse of a temporary tag and driving with a suspended license. His . writings indicated that he had been planning the attack since February, . and he had bought his weapons in an Orlando-area gunshop, police said. More details emerged Tuesday about Seevakumaran's solitary lifestyle. Seevakumaran's family said he was a loner who didn't have a history of violence in a brief statement released by authorities. Beary told the news conference that he acted alone and didn't have any friends. 'He didn't like to talk to people,' Beary said.

Response team: Various police agencies are seen during an investigation of a Seevakumaran's suicide on the University of Central Florida campus . Grisly scene: Arriving officers found a student dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a residence at the Tower 1 dorm . Investigation: About 500 students were evacuated from the dorm as police examined the explosives found inside . Just after noon on Monday, the explosives were removed from the dorm and classes resumed as scheduled. The school utilized text message alerts to keep students informed about the situation. Scare: Students were evacuated from the tower and moved to an open area about 1,000 feet from the UCF Arena . Antonio Whitehead, 21, a junior from . Hollywood, Florida, said he heard the fire alarm go off after midnight . and thought it was a routine alarm. He headed outside where he saw a crowd already heading across the street from the dorm. 'All . of a sudden, I felt the crowd move a little faster. And a police . officer with a machine gun or something told everyone to start moving a . lot faster,' he said. Whitehead, who has lived in the dorm . for two years, said the students were moved to an open area about 1,000 . feet from UCF Arena. Grant . Hernandez, 20, a sophomore from Orlando who also is a resident at the . dorm, said he woke up sometime after midnight when police were . evacuating the building. 'We weren't allowed to get our cars.

A trunk full: The elephants had to be evacuated from this trailer after it caught fire and their trainer gave them vodka to keep warm . Disaster: The trailer was left ruined on the side of a Siberian highway with temperatures as low as -40C . His answer was to dilute 10 litres of vodka diluted in warm water and made sure they drank the whole lot. 'They roared like it was the jungle…They must have been happy,' a district official told news agency RIA Novosti. The Indian elephants, aged 45 and 48, were part of a travelling Polish circus that was headed from Novokuznetsk to Omsk late yesterday. Trunk and disorderly: Elephants Madga and Jenny are part of a Polish circus travelling around Russia . The blaze started when hay in their trailer caught fire from the diesel engine heating the cargo section. A local official said a trainer made the animals jog before giving them two cases of vodka to drink. Emergency minister spokesman Alexander Davydov said the elephants were then delivered to a warm gym at a local community college. They were later examined by a veterinarian who said only the tips of their ears had suffered frostbite. Novosibisk zoo director Rostislav Shilo claimed the vodka saved the animals from frostbite and . pneumonia, without harming or even intoxicating them. The handler was also treated in hospital for frostbite.

Still friends: The pair were last pictured together last month and their relationship apparently became more of a friendship, with them sleeping in separate bedrooms . 'As two mature adults, they came to the difficult decision to go their separate ways while continuing to remain friends.' Jason . also acted as Britney's manager, and the pop star has now changed . management, indicating the pair are also severing ties in their business . relationship. Jason has reportedly resigned as Britney's co-conservator, but her father Jamie Spears will remain as conservator. Further reports claim Jason has already moved out of the home the couple shared together, according to Radar Online. While other sources claim the pair split over their differing opinions about wanting more children. Keeping close: Britney assures fans that she and Jason will 'remain great friends' and added that she will 'always adore him' TMZ.com claim Britney was keen to increase her brood and have children with Trawick, but he wasn't keen to do so. The website states that Jason is 'in another place' and doesn't want to start a family - although 'loves' her boys Sean Preston and Jayden James, her sons with ex Kevin Federline. TMZ also claims the pair argued as Trawick felt being with Spears 'took away his individuality', while he wanted to expand his business and take on more clients - something Spears allegedly wasn't happy with. The split announcement comes the same day as Britney confirmed she had quit her role as a judge on the X Factor. Severing all ties: Jason used to act as Britney's manager but the star, seen with Jason in October, has now changed management . According to the official statement released today, the 31-year-old pop star put in her resignation for the talent competition series on Friday. 'I had an incredible time doing the show and I love the other judges and I am so proud of my teens but it's time for me to get back in the studio,' Britney said, referring to her eighth album. 'Watching them all do their thing up . on that stage every week made me miss performing so much! I can't wait . to get back out there and do what I love most.' However, the Grammy winner's team has reportedly already begun 'serious talks' for lucrative sitcom and Las Vegas concert deals. 'It was a very difficult decision': Britney Spears is rumoured to be planning Vegas show after confirming she quit The X Factor on Friday . According to TMZ, Spears and her . people have been in serious negotiations with one of the Caesars group . properties for 'a while.' The former Mouseketeer is likely . being wooed to star in her own long-running show at the Colloseum at . Caesar's Palace since that is where Cher and Celine Dion also held . residencies.

She actually has very natural comedic talents and is very funny, in an airhead sort of way.' Simon Cowell, 53, was reportedly disappointed with his $15 million contracted employee on the talent competition since he wanted 'crazy Britney, but he got boring Britney.' According to Us Weekly, the network 'paid all that for her to say ""amazing"" and offer half-claps' for her four protegees. The December 20 second season finale was watched by only 9.6 million viewers, down 18 percent from the first season finale. Vegas baby!

"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 10:33 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:15 EST, 20 March 2013 . The closed-circuit television footage showing a double-amputee Marine going through a TSA checkpoint does not show him being forced to remove his prosthetic legs, the government agency claimed today, going directly against the complaint a congressman filed against the government agency earlier this week. On Monday, Rep Duncan Hunter (R-California) wrote a terse letter to Transportation Security Administrator John Pistole asking why Cpl Toran Gaal was forced to remove his prosthetic legs and later had to stand on them without the use of his wheelchair in what the congressman called a ‘humiliating’ experience. However, the TSA has fired back with their own account, saying that initial CCTV footage shows Cpl Gaal passing through the security checkpoint at Arizona’s Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on March 13 without removing his prostheses. Scroll down for video . Humiliated: Marine Cpl Toran Gaal, pictured, lost both of his legs in an IED explosion in Afghanistan; a congressman wrote the TSA to say he was 'humiliated' at a recent security check after he was forced to remove his prostheses . Disputed: The TSA says after a preliminary review of CCTV footage, the Marine was not forced to remove his prosthetic legs (file photo) Cpl Gaal, who was not named in the letter Rep Duncan sent the TSA agent, lost both of his legs to an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in Sangin Province, Afghanistan. The Marine currently lives in San Diego and serves in the Wounded Warrior Battalion out of Camp Pendleton. He and other wounded Marines were flying back after a spring training fundraiser, according to NBC San Diego. The TSA told the Arizona Republic in a statement: ‘Preliminary review of CCTV indicates there was no removal of prosthetic limbs.’ They added that the two men who conducted the March 13 screening are veterans themselves – one, a former Marine and the other, an 18-year veteran of the Air Force. Joe Kasper, Rep Hunter’s Deputy Chief of Staff, spoke to . MailOnline by phone from the congressman’s headquarters in Washington. He said that . the TSA is trying to throw a red herring into the greater argument of how the . war-wounded are treated at airport security. ‘Here’s the thing – TSA’s going to make you think what they . want you to think,’ he said. ‘The Marine never complained. It was the people . who were escorting him. They felt disrespected, they felt mistreated. The . problem here is the situational awareness in the tone and lack of awareness. ‘There has to be a part on TSA to acknowledge there is an . issue – not the leg issue, but the bigger problem that he and other veterans . and the war-wounded need extra help. That’s what it’s all about and that’s what . Mr Hunter was getting at,’ he said. In transit: Cpl Gaal and other wounded Marines were in Phoenix for a spring training event; the alleged incident happened on March 13 when they were flying back to San Diego . He said that Mr Hunter, a combat veteran himself who served . in Fallujah, is passionate about fighting for the rights of U.S. military . members and veterans. ‘He understands what’s involved and there’s nothing that . bothers him more than seeing servicemen mistreated.’ The larger issue, Mr Kasper added, is the lack of respect . and professional courtesies by TSA agents towards those who need extra . assistance – something that is difficult to legislate. 'The . problem here is in the tone and lack of awareness. There has to be a part on TSA to acknowledge there is an . issue, the bigger problem that he and other veterans . and the war wounded need extra help. That’s what it’s all about.' -Joe Kemper, Rep Duncan Hunter's chief of staff . ‘As federal agents themselves, they’re the ones who should . know better, first and foremost,’ he said. ‘Hearing back from the TSA is going to be important,’ he . added, saying that he’s heard no official response from the government agency . since sending the letter via fax on Monday, though he added that the process . can sometimes take weeks. When asked if he could definitively say whether Cpl Gaal was . forced to remove his prostheses, Mr Kasper answered that the other veterans who . were traveling with him would ‘stand by it. ‘Witnesses said he took off his legs,’ Mr Kasper said. ‘At a . bare minimum, he was at least asked to take off his legs.’ Servicemen: Cpl Gaal lost his legs after an explosion in Afghanistan; he is currently stationed in the 'Wounded Warrior' battalion out of Camp Pendleton . He concluded: ‘All the problems with TSA is indicative of . the bigger problems they refuse to address,’ he said. Fight: Rep Duncan Hunter has been vocal in his support of the rights of servicemen . The TSA has not yet responded to MailOnline’s request for . comment. The government agency currently offers a ‘Wounded Warrior’ program where injured service members are allowed to go through an . expedited screening process, but said it would expand its screening . options. Neither Sky Harbor nor the TSA said they received a complaint from the alleged incident. In . his original complaint, Rep Hunter wrote: ‘These Marines had an . unfortunate experience, which is worthy of your attention and any . explanation you can provide.’ In his letter, he included two photographs of the Marine, saying they corroborated Cpl Gaal’s complaint. As the Marine Times notes, Cpl Gaal and his fellow Marines were initially escorted to the wrong checkpoint. Rep Hunter wrote that no TSA officers offered to help him to the correct security checkpoint. ‘I would like to know what discretion a TSA officer has in this situation as well as the ability of TSA officers to assist and individual between screening locations, especially if that individual is unable to walk or move on his or her own,’ he wrote. Rep. Hunter asked in his letter for more sensitivity and awareness when examining military workers.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:44 EST, 9 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:49 EST, 9 July 2012 . Killer: Taped conversations between Mohamed Merah and police negotiators have been leaked to a French TV station . Toulouse terrorist Mohamed Merah told police he would keep on killing and that he 'loved death more than they loved life' as he was hiding under siege in his flat, it has emerged. Taped exchanges between the Al Qaeda-inspired gunman and police reveal he also said he had not planned on being caught and 'was ready for all of the tactics negotiators would try'. The chilling words, recorded during a 32-hour stand-off at his apartment after he killed seven people, were broadcast on French national television station TF1 yesterday. Their airing has sparked outrage from relatives of the victims, and an investigation into how the audio was obtained has also now been launched. In the clips, the 23-year-old can be heard defying the police and declaring he was not afraid to die. Merah eventually died in a shootout as police tried to storm his apartment. He said: 'I know that there's a chance you could kill me, that's a risk I'm taking. So there we are, know that you are up against a man who is not afraid of death.' After his first two attacks on March 11 and March 15 left three French uniformed soldiers dead, Mohamed Merah shot and killed Rabbi Jonathan Sandler. He also gunned down his two young sons Gavriel and Aryeh, and another young girl, Miriam Monsonego, outside the Ozar Hatorah school on March 19. Scene: A general view of the block of apartments in which Mohammed Merah was shot by police . He also told negotiators he wanted to carry out more attacks on sites he happened upon, as he did the Jewish school. He said: 'I would leave everything to chance and proceed without any preparation.' And he revealed his 'goal in these attacks was to kill soldiers engaged in Afghanistan, and all manner of their allies, be it the police, gendarmerie, everything.' Of the school shooting, he said: 'I took the scooter and I went just like that, it was not premeditated. At the end of the day it was my intention, but the morning when I woke up it was not my objective.' Interior Minister Manuel Valls condemned the broadcast of the extracts in a statement issued shortly after the programme aired. Victims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, 30, Abel Chennouf, 25, and Mohamed Legouade, 26 were killed by Merah . Tragedy: Rabbi Jonathan Sandler (left) and his sons Arieh, 5, and Gabriel, 4, were gunned down. Miriam Monsonego, daughter of the school's headteacher, was also killed . He regretted it had come at a time when court proceedings relating to the killings were still ongoing and said it showed a lack of respect to relatives of the victims. The police unit responsible for internal investigations, the IGPN, would be launching an investigation, the interior ministry added. Emmanuel Chain, the producer of 'Sept a Huit', the programme that broadcast the extracts, defended decision to run the tapes, said it had a 'high news value'. He added: 'We acted responsibly. We learn how Merah trained with Al Qaeda, his determination. We learn a lot of things, it has been very much put in context.' It was precisely because they had the feelings of relatives of the victims in mind that they had decided not to run other parts of the tape, he added. Bullet holes line the wall of the apartment of Mohamed Merah, the self-proclaimed Islamic extremist who killed seven people, after a 32-hour siege . But a lawyer for relatives of Imad Ibn Ziaten, the first soldier killed by Merah, said he had filed a complaint for violation of the secrecy of an investigation and receipt of stolen goods. 'The family is outraged, because these murders are not a show and the documents are part of judicial proceedings,' said Mohan Mouhou, who represents the victim's parents. Samia Maktouf, another lawyer representing relatives of those killed, said they would go to court to get an order banning any further broadcast of the tapes on any medium. She said: 'The victims are outraged to learn the contents of these negotiations on television. 'At this rate, the videos of the killings will end up on the Web and the damage then will be irreversible.' Merah filmed his killings and in March the pan-Arab television channel al-Jazeera received a copy on a USB memory key at its Paris bureau. The channel decided not to run the footage and the main French television networks also said they would not run the material if it became available.","Merah, 23, killed seven in March during week-long rampage .

A six-month-old baby girl who died after she was shot sitting on her father's lap in his van was buried amid emotional scenes in a Chicago church yesterday. As the tiny body of Jonylah Watkins lay before mourners in an open coffin, Reverend Corey Brooks, who led the service, called on local gang members - with whom her father was allegedly connected - to change. And the baby's maternal grandmother Mary Young read a poem pleading for the local community to change, saying: 'My neighbours of Chicago, what have thou done?' In his eulogy Reverend Corey Brooks called on gang members to use Jonylah's death as a catalyst to change their lifestyles . Tragedy: Jonylah 's murder has shocked Chicago - a city where gun violence in some neighborhoods has become routine . Jonylah's parents Jonathan Watkins, left, and Judy Young, right, say goodbye to their six-month-old daughter before closing her casket yesterday . Jonylah died last week when she was struck by a bullet police say was intended for her father, former offender Jonathan Watkins, 29. The bullet tore through several organs in her body in what was the second time the infant had been a victim of gunfire: when her mother Judy, 20, was eight months pregnant, she was shot in the knee as she walked home with a group of women. Jonylah's father was shot twice in the attack that killed his daughter but survived. Frustrated by the lack of progress in their murder investigation, police say no-one has come forward to help from the local community. At yesterday's funeral, Jonylah's grandmother hit out at the culture of silence in a poem she had written for the service. She said: 'My neighbours of Chicago, our youth is in danger on the streets of the town with the false code of silence while they shoot each other down. A family member is consoled during Jonylah's funeral at the New Beginnings Church in Chicago .

Jonylah had been sitting in her father's lap in the driver's seat of a parked minivan on March 11 when a gunman opened fire. The baby, whose mother was working at McDonalds at the time, died the next morning from her wounds after surgeons spent hours trying to save her. Reverend Corey Brooks broke down during his eulogy, while family and friends dressed in tribute to Jonylah . Friends and family members dressed in white and pink in honour of little Jonylah in emotional scenes at her funeral . The church was packed with mourners paying their last respects to the girl who never made her first birthday . Murdered: Jonylah Watkins was shot as she sat on her father, Jonathan's lap. She survived a separate shooting of her mother Judy when she was still in the womb . Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said the shooting appeared to be gang-related, though detectives don't have a specific motive. Despite the shocking crime, neighbors are refusing to cooperate with police. 'We don't have one individual who's stepping up to help us,' McCarthy said. Horrified: Jonylah's mother Judy Watkins, 20, was at work at McDonald's when she shooting happened. She was shot and wounded when her daughter was still in the womb . Chicago continues to struggle with devastating gun violence at some of the highest rates in the nation. The city had 57 murders in January and February - including 43 in January alone, the most violent month in a decade. The number grabbed national headlines at a time when Congress was debating tougher gun control laws. Many - if not most - of the killings are the result of gang-related violence that is largely concentrated on the city's south side. The 43 murders in January in Chicago compare to just 24 in New York for the same month - despite the Big Apple being three times the size of the Windy City. The killing of Jonylah Watkins is only the latest high-profile Chicago murder to shock the nation. Just days after she performed at President Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony in Washington, Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was killed on the street near her home. Still, there is good news. In February the city charged just 14 murders - the lowest number since 1957. Mr Watkins told the Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital room that he was devastated by the death of his infant daughter. 'I was trying to help. I was trying to help. I was trying to help her,' he said, breaking down. Still, he claims he has no idea who shot him or why he was targeted. The fatal shooting came months after Jonylah's mother Judy, 20, was hit by a gunman when she was pregnant with Jonylah. Her family said Mrs Watkins was hit in the knee when she was eight months pregnant as she walked home with a group of women. In January and February this year, 57 people were killed in Chicago - most of them victims of gang-related shootings on the south side of the city. Chicago gained national attention when its murders for January spiked to 43, the highest rate in years - making the city even more dangerous than when mobster Al Capone ruled the streets. In February killings dropped to 14 for the month - the lowest since 1957. Police said Mr Watkins,had links to the Gangster Disciples clique, though his family denies he has ties to gangs. The gunman shot at the father and baby from an alley and hit Mr Watkins in the cheek and buttocks, Chicago police spokesman John Mirabelli said. The gunman then got into a nearby blue minivan and fled the scene, according to DNAinfo. Dominique Young, 21, Mr Watkins' sister, said she heard the gunfire and arrived at the van within seconds to find the windows had been shot through. She told DNAinfo: ‘They knew she was in there and they tried to take my niece's life, and it's so wrong.' Rev Brooks' church New Beginnings Church of Chicago is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest. The family have called on the 'cowardly' gunman to turn himself in.","Six-month-old Jonylah Watkins buried in Chicago a week after being shot .

Scott Wilson took a £7,000 cello and an £8,000 violin belonging to members of the Europe Orchestral Ensemble which were due to perform at Customs House in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, on February 9. The owner of the Muller cello said he was left devastated after the theft because it stopped him from being able to perform and make money. This Muller cello (left) which was stolen by Scott Wilson (right) to fund his drug habit in South Shields . He told detectives: 'I can no longer complete our European tour with the orchestra. 'The cello is my life and my livelihood. This has had a great impact on my life.' The stolen violin was a rare Lorenz Neudorf, made in 1878, which was in a case with two Fretschner bows. Its owner said: 'My violin is everything to me. It is almost impossible to replace.' Precious: The violin stolen from a member of the Europe Orchestral Ensemble was made in 1878 . It was only after the thief saw an . appeal to trace the precious items that he realised what he had done and . contacted police himself. Vic .

Wilson, of no fixed address, admitted burglary at the performance venue as well as at Flagg Court Health Centre in South Shields where he stole a £300 iPhone from a worker’s pocket and the Mecca Bingo in the town where he stole a £350 television set, both in February . Wilson asked for 13 other burglaries to be taken into consideration by the judge. The court heard they all, except one, happened in February when Wilson targeted public buildings including hospitals, a funeral parlour, a hotel and the Sage music and arts centre in Gateshead. He had been given a community order for shoplifting and criminal damage just nine days before the Customs House raid. Judge Penny Moreland sentenced Wilson to a total of 19 months in jail. The judge told him: 'In respect of the Customs House you stole extremely valuable, unique instruments, causing, no doubt, great distress to those who owned them. 'Though, I accept, and it is to your credit, you facilitated the recovery of them once you realised what it was you had stolen.' Mr Laffey told the court Wilson was homeless and owed money for drugs at the time. He said: 'The background to all these offences is essentially the same, this young man is a drug addict.

She was hosting regular music and poetry nights, introducing established performers such as Ed Sheeran, and her talent even led to a meeting with Tony Blair. But aged 23 she suffered a stroke and brain infection which robbed her of the ability to write. Poet: Jodi Ann Bickley set up a website called 'a million lovely letters' after suffering a stroke to remind total strangers just how amazing they are . The 24-year-old from Kings Heath, Birmingham was bitten by a tick while performing at the music and arts festival Bestival in summer 2011. Sadly for Jodi she was one of the one-in-200,000 for whom the bite developed into encephalitis and within three weeks she was struck down with headaches and vertigo which triggered a stroke that left her partially paralysed down her right side, leaving her unable to walk or write. But the writer refused to let her ill health steal her passion and in secret she learned to write again and is now touching the hearts of hundreds of strangers by writing them lovely little letters to let them know just how special they are. On her website, onemillionlovelyletters.com, Jodi explains that since being taken ill with a brain infection she suffers really bad headaches, dizziness . and she feels . like she's 'strapped to a lead balloon', spending much of her time indoors. One million lovely letters: Jodi has already sent out 500 letters to people to brighten up their day and encourages people to contact her on her website . She writes: 'I have to spend a lot of time . in bed and in my house and have a tendency on my good days to want to . get everything I possibly can done, which I soon get reminded by my . brain isn’t possible,' 'When given so much time you can do one of two . things you can sit and let the pain and the rubbish that comes with it . consume you or you can do something ace.' She continues: 'I’ve recently been blessed with a lot . of time. We always say we don’t have enough of it – how we would love . more of it and how it seem to flies. 'I know that . sometimes people just need a little reminder by someone that they are . just amazing and that’s what I want to do with the time that I’ve been . given.' Talented: Not letting her illness get the better of her, Jodi decided to put her time to good use and taught herself to write again . Jodi then decided to put her time to good use by writing complete strangers a little letter, or 'hug in an envelope' as she puts it, to remind them of just how amazing they are. She writes: 'In the UK alone there are 62,641,000 . people, in the whole wide world there are 7,038,044,500. The average . person has 3 close friends and 19 “mates” so take that off and you are . still left with seven billion thirty-eight million forty-four thousand . four hundred and seventy eight strangers. 'And all of those strangers . have at least one day where they could use a little lift.' She encourages website visitors to email her, include their name and address and why they would like a letter, for example: 'I’m feeling a little glum'. Pen and paper: Jodi has gone back to the old school method of communication and rather than writing virtually, she has penned these lovely notes to people then posted them across the country . 'Anything really, just why you need a little cheering up or a reminder that actually you are really lovely,' 'I think everyone deserves to know that they are thought of and they are loved. 'Even if it is by a complete stranger,' she adds. And it seems that the kind-hearted poet's idea is really paying off. One user wrote on her website: 'I have just received one of your lovely letters, two days before going to court to have my home repossessed, and though I have tried to remain positive your letter, though it made me cry, really helped. 'I want to say thank you. Houses come and go, but love is what really matters and that is what I will hold onto'.

A shamed teacher who was caught in a car with a 17-year-old pupil yesterday admitted that she had sex with the youth. A court heard how Eppie Sprung Dawson, 26, had agreed to give the dyslexic teenager extra help with his lessons at the Catholic secondary where she worked. But the married English teacher, who was only four years into her career, drove him to the countryside, stopped in a lay-by and had sex with him. They were spotted together by police officers on a routine patrol. At Dumfries Sheriff Court yesterday, Dawson admitted that on December 21, while she was in a position of trust, she engaged in sexual activities with, or directed towards, a person under the age of 18, and that she had sexual intercourse with him. Procurator fiscal depute Lyndsay Hunter said that Dawson had met the youth in Dumfries and then drove him to a lay-by on the Cummertrees to Hoddam Road. She said that at around 5.20pm, police noticed the car, which had condensation on its windows. The fiscal added: ‘The officers remained in their vehicle and spotted the couple in the passenger seat of the car. ‘They left their vehicle and approached the parked car where they saw the couple having sexual intercourse. Happily married: Eppie Sprung Dawson with her husband Ranald Dawson on their wedding day . Dawson admitted that while she was in a position of trust as a teacher she had sex with one of her pupils . 'The police officers knocked on the car door and then saw the accused and a male, both naked from the waist down.’ Mrs Hunter said that Dawson was spoken to and it became clear that she was a teacher. The fiscal added that she made no reply when  cautioned and charged. Sheriff George Jamieson deferred sentence until May 1 and called for reports, including a psychiatric assessment. Dawson, of Dumfries, who taught at the town’s St Joseph’s College, was placed on the sex offenders’ register. Responsibility: Dawson taught at St Joseph's College and was four years into her career .

"By . Emma Reynolds . UPDATED: . 06:34 EST, 1 November 2011 . JK Rowling nearly killed off Harry Potter or one his two best friends midway through writing the books, the writer has revealed. Halfway through the wildly popular series, Miss Rowling said she 'seriously' considered 'polishing one of them off'. And it was ginger-haired joker Ron Weasley who seemed the most likely candidate for the axe, Miss Rowling admitted in a no-holds-barred interview with the star of the films, Daniel Radcliffe. Confession: JK Rowling with young stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint at the world premiere in London of Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 . The British author, who is apparently worth £530million, said she considered having Ron die 'out of sheer spite'. She said she had never originally intended to kill off one of the three main characters, and thought the fact she even considered it showed she 'wasn't in a very happy place' at that point. 'I think in my absolute heart of heart of hearts, although I did seriously consider killing Ron, I wouldn't have done it,' she told the actor in their interview on a new DVD. A fan wrote on The Leaky Cauldron fan site: 'Ron cannot die because he's Hermione's true love.' Another said: 'Well she killed off three of my favourites: Sirius, Snape and Dobby, so I suppose I should be grateful she didn't kill Ron.' Miss Rowling served up some brutal treatment for some of her best-loved characters.

'Funnily enough, I planned from the start that none of them would die,' said the author in the special feature on the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 DVD. The interview was leaked online ahead of the DVD's release later this year. The writer goes on to say: 'Then midway through, which I think is a reflection of the fact that I wasn't in a very happy place, I started thinking I might polish one of them off. 'Out of sheer spite: ""There, now you definitely can't have him any more.""

On his way: Nancy Gonzalez, who became pregnant with an inmate's baby, has gone into labor . A 29-year-old prison guard who became pregnant during an affair with convicted cop-killer Ronnell Wilson has gone into labour, her lawyer has revealed. Nancy Gonzalez was excused from a court date in New York on Wednesday because she is having contractions, her attorney Anthony Ricco told the court, the New York Post reported. The former Metropolitan Detention Center guard was charged with having unlawful sex with an inmate and later failed a drugs test, admitting she had taken cocaine to deal with the stress of her arrest. Gonzales is facing 15 years in prison after being arrested on suspicion that she . had hatched a plot with Ronnell Wilson to help save his life. The convicted killer . allegedly impregnated Gonzales to avoid the death penalty and had been so desperate to father a child . that he offered to confess to the murders of two detectives, according to his . former lawyer. Attorney Ephraim Savitt said that in 2006, his then-client . Ronell Wilson was poised to accept a plea deal as part of which he would accept . responsibility for the 2003 slayings of undercover detectives Rodney Andrews . and James Nemorin and be sentenced to a life in prison. Illegal liaison: Gonzalez, left, was arrested after police say she had an illicit affair with convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson, right, and became pregnant with his baby to save him from execution . Explanation: Gonzalez allegedly said in a recorded phone conversation that she was 'vulnerable' when she decided to start a relationship with Wilson in a bid to give him some 'hope' 'Wilson advised me that he would take the life deal - as . long as he could have conjugal visits - because he was determined to leave this . earth with a child of his own, to give his wasted life some meaning,' Savitt . told the New York Post. For Wilson to be . allowed to meet with women behind . bars, he would have had to be sent to a state prison, but his former . attorney . said that the negotiations with the prosecution never went that far . because Attorney general Alberto Gonzalez rejected the proposed . agreement. Gonzalez was arrested on . charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the . night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the . law. She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, . according to court papers. On her Facebook page, Gonzalez posted . a photo last month depicting herself proudly showing off her swollen . pregnant belly in a tight yellow T-shirt with the world 'Love' printed . across the front. Victims: Detectives James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, right, were gunned down by Wilson during a drug bust gone awry in Staten Island in 2003 . Legal complications: Wilson's death sentence was thrown out after an appeals court found that a prosecutor had vilified the convicted killer . Wilson was found guilty in December . 2006 of shooting detectives James Nemorin, 36, and Rodney Andrews, 34, . in the back of their heads in a car March 10, 2003 in Staten Island. The . following year, he was sentenced to death, making him the first federal . defendant in New York to face capital punishment since 1954. However, . an appeals court reversed the sentence in 2010 claiming than a . prosecutor violated Wilson's constitutional rights by making him out to . be a villain. A new jury must decide his fate. But . replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers . seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty . because he is mentally disabled. Military career: Before taking a job as a federal corrections officer, Gonzalez served in the U.S. Army . 'Stressed out': She failed a drugs test at her arrest and said she took cocaine as she was 'stressed' Gonzales was taken into custody at her Long Island home. She could face 15 years in prison if convicted. According . to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted . killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants. One inmate said he witnessed the female guard moving away . from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down. CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners. Insanity claim: Wilson's defense argued that he cannot be executed because he is mentally handicapped . The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen. The corrections officer came clean . about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August . 2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving . time in a state prison. 'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to . come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly . said.

Adam Wyatt (left) whose heart stopped on the rugby pitch was saved by medical student Luke McLennan . A rugby player who collapsed and 'died' for 22 minutes during a match was brought back to life - by an opponent who is training to be a doctor. Medical student Luke McLennan, 22, came to the rescue when opposing prop forward Adam Wyatt, 51, slumped to the ground during a line-out. The fifth year medical student put his training into practice and calmly kept Mr Wyatt alive with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until paramedics arrived. The father-of-two heart was eventually re-started with a defibrillator on the fourth attempt - 22 minutes after he collapsed unconscious. The consultant paediatric nurse spent more than a month in hospital and has now been re-united with his saviour. Modest Mr McLennan, who is studying medicine at Peninsula Medical School in Exeter, Devon, said: ‘It happened very quickly, I have never seen anything like this on a pitch before. ‘Any student in my position with my knowledge would have done the same thing - it was more luck than management, to be honest. ‘He was dead for 22 minutes, and if you look at the statistics, not many people will survive that so it is pretty amazing.’ Mr Wyatt, who has no memory of the incident, is so shocked by his brush with death that he has decided to hang up his playing boots. He said: ‘The heart attack was completely out of the blue, I have never had any problems with my health or my heart before. ‘I am so thankful for Luke for what he has done for me and my family, massively thankful, I really can't thank him enough. Adam Wyatt, 51, was saved by medical student Luke McLennan after his heart stopped for 22 minutes . ‘To be dead for 22 minutes is a bit . scary, it just puts everything into perspective of what I could have . lost, I have finally now decided to hang up my boots and retire.’ The . incident happened on January 27 as Mr Wyatt played for home team . Paignton RFU's veteran team against Withycombe RFU from nearby Exmouth. Mr McLenna, of Exeter, was playing in his debut game for Withycombe and came on a substitute full back after 20 minutes. He explained: ‘I had been on the pitch for around five or ten minutes and the game had been going on for around 20 minutes. ‘There . was a line-out and then all of a sudden some of the guys were suddenly . standing around Andy shouting for people to call an ambulance. ‘I . walked over and they were putting him in the recovery position which I . didn't feel was adequate so I asked if they were medical and they . weren't so I decided to take charge. ‘I . felt for a pulse and couldn't find one so I put him on his back and . began CPR, I probably did that for around 15 minutes before the . ambulance arrived. ‘I . carried on while they did what they had to do and they administered . shocks, it was on the fourth one that his heart was started again and . then a few hours later I got a text to say he was okay.’ Mr . Wyatt, who lives near Bovey Tracey and works at Langdon Hospital near . Exmouth, was rushed to Torbay Hospital where he spent a month . recovering. He said: ‘I can't remember a thing from that day, not even going to the match. The match in which Adam Wyatt collapsed with cardiac arrest took place at Paignton Rugby Club in Devon . ‘I woke up in hospital and stayed in there for about a month, I was pretty confused when I woke up but was filled in about what happened and that the match was abandoned. ‘The period of time is just a blur to be honest, I asked my friend where I was and I was told I had a heart attack, so I had to take that in. ‘My family weren't at the match luckily, but someone from the club gave my wife a call to let her know what had happened, she was pretty shocked.’ The pair were re-united at Paignton's Queens Park ground where the incident happened. Adam's wife Camilla, 55, said: ‘We are both so thankful for Luke for what he did, every single day I think about what could have happened, he saved my husband's life. ‘It is so lucky that he is a medical student and knew what he was doing, he told me that his eyes were rolling into the back of his head and he knew that something was wrong. ‘On the morning before the match he was fine, there were no signs that this was going to happen, just normal, I think that is why it was such a shock.’","Adam Wyatt, 51, had a heart attack on the pitch and 'died' for 22 minutes .

Across Britain, campaigners have been battling with local authorities to prevent the closure of their cherished libraries faced with Government cuts. But one English town has found itself in a unique position - with locals battling against the opening of a new £2million library. Residents in Glossop, Derbyshire, have argued that an existing library, housed in a 19th century gothic revival hall should remain, despite being in need of major renovation. Conflict: Derbyshire County Council has proposed the building of a new library 'that is fit for the 21st century' in Glossop. But a campaign group wants the existing library in Victoria Hall (pictured) to remain . The affinity displayed by some locals for Victoria Hall has prompted a complicated debate over the future of public reading in the town. The ground floor of Victoria Hall, constructed in 1888, is leased to Derbyshire county council for free by High Peak borough council, which is its trustee. The county council plans to build a new library offering 'new, enhanced and extended services' on the site, which was previously a primary school and currently serves as a county council social services building. The proposed build, which includes 'ancillary accommodation' and 'garden space', will be considered by the council's planning committee on Monday. Campaign group Glossop Soul (Save . Our Unique Library) said that it will take a favourable planning decision to judicial review, claiming that 97 per cent of 1,000 residents questioned were opposed to the plans. The group has expressed concern that the hall will fall into disrepair if the library is removed and queries whether it would cost as much to repair as has been mooted. Offer: The county council's leader Andrew Lewer said he wanted to 'provide the best possible library' for Glossop (pictured) Challenge: Campaign group Glossop Soul (Save Our Unique Library) said that it will take the planning decision to judicial review, claiming that 97 per cent of 1,000 residents questioned were opposed to the plans . The listed building is in desperate need of renovation and the county council argues that any proposed redevelopment of it would be limited by a covenant. Having been built on land donated by 2nd Lord Howard of Glossop, he stipulated that it should only be used for 'the purpose of the erection of a public free library and public hall thereon'. The borough council, controlled by Labour, has offered to transfer ownership of the hall to the Conservative-run county council, hoping that it will spend the £2million pot on the existing library. But the county council's leader . Andrew Lewer said he wanted to 'provide the best possible library'. He said: 'I find it deeply disappointing that party . politics ahead of a tense county council election has led to efforts to . portray the building of a new library in Glossop as somehow bad news.' Denying that council was planning the move without adequate consultation, he told the Guardian: 'Elsewhere in the country libraries are closing and here we are making this exciting and forward-looking investment. 'The county council wants to provide . the best possible library, the borough council would like to unload one . of the large number of expensive 19th-century buildings it owns that are . underused and costly. 'Saving Victoria Hall and saving – or . rather improving – Glossop library are both worthwhile but it does not . follow that they are one and the same thing.' A spokesman for Derbyshire County Council said: 'The current building – Victoria Hall – is just not suitable for a 21st century library. The plans we have are for a much bigger, lighter, brighter library for the town giving space for more books and computers for public use. 'We only occupy one of three floors of Victoria Hall and this floor needs around £500,000 of essential repairs. 'This would not improve the service we provide or refurbish the top floor which is currently empty, or the basement which is used by a local youth group. 'There is a restrictive covenant on the building that would prevent us from using the other floors in a way that would meet our accommodation requirements in Glossop.'","Derbyshire county council wants to build the new library in Glossop .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:31 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:31 EST, 9 January 2013 . American officials blamed the Iranian government for a series of coordinated hacking attacks that targeted U.S. banks. The hackers purposefully targeted bank databases and flooded their systems causing major disruptions and even complete shutdowns of company networks. No money was stolen and no individual accounts were breached as the hacks were merely meant to disrupt business for the banks, which officials say is a trademark of a government-lead attack. Targeted: A series of cyber attacks have disrupted service to the data centers for a long list of U.S.-based banks like Citibank, but because they only effected the websites and did not steal money, officials believe they were government-backed . 'There is no doubt within the U.S. government that Iran is behind these attacks,' former state department official James Lewis told The New York Times. Distrust: American officials believe that the hacks were approved by Iranian government forces, headed by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Mr Lewis, who now works as a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that the unparalleled to any prior government-backed attacks. Though the attacks have been kept relatively quiet- largely because the lack of stolen funds caused little concern to individual bank users- a shocking amount of financial institutions have been targeted. So far, Bank of America, HSBC, Capital One, PNC, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank have all been disrupted. A hacking group named Izz ad-Din al Qassam Cyber Fighters claimed responsibility for the attacks in an online message board, but the U.S. government says that group is simply a puppet organization run by the Iranian government. Government-on-government virtual attacks are not unheard of, and the U.S. has actually perpetrated their own against Iran in the past. According to a different New York Times story, the U.S. teamed up with Israel in 2010 to target the computer facilities at a Iranian nuclear facility. Iranian . government officials deny having any connection to the latest string of . attacks, saying that they would not stoop to the American's level. Excuse? The hacking group that claimed responsibility for the attacks said that they were done because the U.S. government refuses to completely remove the offensive anti-Islam film made by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula (center) 'Unlike . the United States, which has per reports in the media given itself the . license to engage in illegal cyber-warfare against Iran, Iran respects . the international law and refrains from targeting other nations’ economic or financial institutions,' Alireza Miryousefi, an . Iranian-United Nations envoy, told The New York Times. In the online post which boasts of plotting the attacks, Izz ad-Din al Qassam Cyber Fighters say that the attacks are due to the American government's refusal to remove an anti-Muslim film from the internet. 'But the american profiteer rulers' insistence and persistence in disregarding this reasonable demand of all Muslims of the world and not taking an action to remove this offensive film shows these tyrants insist that continue to insult Muslim saints,' the group wrote in a document on hacker-friendly site Pastebin. U.S. officials differ, however, saying that it simply a ruse and the true reason is the continued implementation of economic and political sanctions against Iran.","American banks targeted in string of disruptive hacking attacks .

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 10:40 EST, 20 October 2011 . You'd have thought there's not a lot that can go wrong when putting up a huge road sign. But council workers in Oldham showed just how tricky it can be when they installed a 'Welcome' sign ... upside down. After stepping back to admire their handiwork on Lees Street in Chadderton and not realising anything was a amiss they then packed up and headed off to their next job. What happened next is a bit of a mystery as local resident Andrew Robinson, who took a picture of the error, says it stayed that way overnight while council officials insist it was turned the right way up within an hour of being wrongly fitted. Whoops! Staff working for Oldham council failed to notice their wonky sign blunder on Lees Street in Chadderton . Mr Robinson said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw two workmen packing up after replacing the sign with a new one upside down. 'I checked again in the morning and took some photographs because I thought I'd either dreamt it or can't have seen it properly. 'I really can't believe the level of . incompetence shown by Oldham council and find the tag line 'working for a . co-operative borough' ironic. 'Surely they can't have left without looking at it? How hard is it to put up a sign?' A council spokesman said: 'A genuine . error was made by staff. We were notified by the public that same day . and it was rectified within an hour.' The new sign was designed to show the . Chadderton crest. Michael Lawson, of Chadderton Historical Society, . which campaigned to have the crest included, said: 'I understand . councillor Jim McMahon is making a big impression on the borough and . turning things upside down but we didn't think he was going this far. Mistake: Workmen spent two hours carefully creating a road marking only to mis-spell it as 'Loading OLNY' in Lynmouth, Devon . 'On a serious note we think that he is doing a great job and he has our full support. It's marvellous to see the crest up. 'It makes us proud of the township and the metropolitan borough and shows we are all moving in the same direction.' Meanwhile, workmen spent two hours carefully creating a road marking only to mis-spell it as 'Loading OLNY'. The glaring error, written in clear, white paint, was left in the centre of the village of Lynmouth, Devon. Parking rebels in the village are refusing to obey the message claiming it is not enforceable because of the mistake. Jo Backhouse, from Lynmouth Stores, said: 'Not a lot of people noticed the mistake at first as it is not that obvious until you cross the road.

Accusations: David Cameron is said to have signed Britain up to a blueprint for a Euro Army . David Cameron was accused yesterday of signing Britain up to a blueprint for a Euro Army. European leaders agreed plans for greater defence co-operation at a summit in Brussels that will force Britain to consult fellow EU nations over defence planning, with defence chiefs having to co-ordinate capabilities and procurement. The plans appear to duplicate the role of the Nato alliance, which Tories have traditionally credited with sole responsibility for European defence. The communique issued at the end of the summit also featured calls for a co-ordinated policy to boost development of defence technology across Europe. In language that Eurosceptics last night denounced as a power grab, the document calls for ‘a more systematic and longer term European defence co-operation’, including through ‘pooling and sharing of military capabilities’. And it demands that EU countries should be ‘systematically considering co-operation from the outset in national defence planning’. A review will be conducted by Britain’s commissioner in Brussels, Labour peer Baroness Ashton, who will report by September, and EU leaders will agree plans at a summit in December 2013. Downing Street insisted the plans are welcome since they will encourage smaller countries to make more useful defence contributions at a time when budgets are tight. Officials stressed that the UK already co-operates closely with France, Europe’s other main military power. A senior source said: ‘We are very relaxed about this. Nato will still have primacy.’ But Eurosceptics demanded reassurances that the plans would not undermine the Atlantic alliance. Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘The Conservative Party position has always been that Nato is the bedrock of the defence of Europe. A communique issued at the end of the EU summit calls for a coordinated policy to boost development of defence technology . ‘The idea of a European defence force is something that we’ve absolutely been against. Even if this is only a first step, it is worrying. ‘Slice by slice they [the EU] will expand their influence and what begins as co-operation will end up as a Euro Army.’ Douglas Carswell, MP for Clacton, said: ‘If anyone seriously believes that it is in our national interest to hand over our defence to the people running the euro, they need their head examined.’ Britain is likely to help arm the Syrian rebels early in the New Year, David Cameron signalled yesterday. The Prime Minister won approval from his 27 fellow European Union leaders to tear up the current arms embargo over the next few months if the rebels cannot oust dictator Bashar al-Assad alone.In a dramatic move, leaders ordered foreign ministers ‘to work on all options to support and help the opposition’. Mr Cameron said everything including military action was ‘robustly on the table’ and that indifference over the slaughter in Syria was ‘not an option’. The leaders also signed a statement that the Assad regime is ‘illegitimate’ and should be replaced by the rebels. Britain and France are in talks with America and other countries about providing military assistance to the rebels, which could see them join Arab states in supplying small arms, ammunition and shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles.","Plans appear to duplicate role of Nato alliance which Tories credit with responsibility for European defence .

Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, was buried at sea today with a full military service. The ashes of the ‘reluctant’ icon of the 1960s Space Race were transported on the guided missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and were committed to the Atlantic Ocean. Yesterday, Armstrong was praised in a memorial service at the National Cathedral as a humble hero who led mankind into space. Scroll down for video .

In an immensely moving moment, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Paul Nagy and Armstrong's wife Carol, committed the remains of Neil Armstrong to sea while members of the ceremonial U.S. Navy guard offered a final salute. After the ceremony, Mrs Armstrong accepted an American flag from the captain folded 13 times. It is always given to family members of the deceased following the service. Armstrong flew in nearly 80 combat missions for the Navy during the Korean War before joining forces with NASA. The ceremony was in accordance with Navy burial procedures, NBC News reported, and included remarks from Navy chaplain Donald Troast, and three volleys of ammunition were set off by a firing squad. In addition, Taps was played while family members and sailors looked on. NASA didn't give the location of the private ceremony. However, the ship's home port is located in Mayport, Florida. Armstrong, who died on August 25 from heart surgery complications, made it clear that he wished to be buried at sea, though because of his stature, he could have had a memorial in Arlington National Cemetery in Washington.

As commander of the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. The legendary astronaut was born on August 5, 1930, near Wapakoneta, Ohio. He went on to work in the military, fighting in the Korean War. Later, he would pilot planes for NASA, and eventually, spacecrafts. During the historic mission on July 20, 1969, nearly half a billion people tuned in to watch the black and white mission to the moon, where Armstrong, joined by Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin, spent some two hours loping around on the eerie grey surface. He radioed back to Earth the historic news of 'one giant leap for mankind.' 'The sights were simply magnificent, beyond any visual experience that I had ever been exposed to,' Armstrong once said. Lunar landing: Astronauts Neil Armstrong, left, and Buzz Aldrin, right, place an American flag on the lunar surface as taken from the Eagle Lunar Module . The moonwalk marked America's victory in the Cold War space race that began October 4, 1957, with the launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, a 184-pound satellite that sent shock waves around the world. Although he had been a Navy fighter pilot, a test pilot for NASA's forerunner and an astronaut, Armstrong never allowed himself to be caught up in the celebrity and glamor of the space program. 'I am, and ever will be, a white socks, pocket protector, nerdy engineer,' he said in February 2000 in one of his rare public appearances. 'And I take a substantial amount of pride in the accomplishments of my profession.' However, his Apollo 11 moon mission turned out to be Armstrong's last space flight. The following year he was appointed to a desk job, being named NASA's deputy associate administrator for aeronautics in the office of advanced research and technology. He left NASA a year later to become a professor of engineering at the University of Cincinnati.

Luka Magnotta, 30, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the gruesome slaying and dismemberment of Jun Lin last May. He is accused of killing the university student and posting a video online that shows him stabbing and having sex with the dismembered corpse. Scroll down for video .

Wearing a black sweater with colored . stripes, Magnotta appeared distressed during a video evidence session . this morning. The evidence is subject to a publication ban, until it is . determined that there is enough evidence to go to trial. He held his hand over his mouth and asked the guard in his glass-enclosed defendant's box for a five-minute break. He stood up and collapsed on the floor just after the judge agreed to an extended lunch break. According to Canadian Press, he was all of a sudden lying on his right side, crumpled into a fetal position, in the courtroom, still handcuffed and shackled. Overcome: The suspect, pictured in court sketch, held his hand over his mouth and asked the guard in his glass-enclosed defendant's box for a five-minute break . 'You might want to make room for an ambulance,' the Crown prosecutor, Louis Bouthillier, told the guards outside the courtroom. 'Somebody's collapsed.' Canadian Press said Magnotta's eyes were fixed on the ground not on the screen where the, presumably gruesome, video evidence was being shown. When he began covering his mouth, his lawyers came to check on him and 10 minutes into that segment of the hearing he asked the baliff to his side to request the break. As well as first-degree murder, Magnotta is also facing four other charges relating to the case. He is accused of dismembering Lin and mailing parts of his body across Canada, before leading police on an international manhunt before he was finally arrested in Germany.

The . porn actor first appeared in court last Monday as his lawyers . unsuccessfully sought to close pre-trial proceedings to the press and . public. Magnotta has observed all hearings from a glass enclosure in the packed Montreal court room. During the proceedings, which are expected to last another one to two weeks, prosecutors are outlining the case against 30-year-old Magnotta and seek to persuade a judge they have enough evidence for the case to go to trial.

'We had so much hope for Jun Lin.' Police say the video, which they believe is genuine, showed a man stabbing his victim to death before dismembering the corpse and then eating part of the body. Lin's hands and feet were mailed in May to the offices of political parties in Ottawa and to schools in Vancouver. His torso was found in a pile of garbage behind Magnotta's Montreal apartment, and his head was discovered in a Montreal park in July. Lin was a student at Concordia University in Montreal. Initial arguments revolved around an unusual defense request to exclude the public and the media, which was denied. The court imposed a publication ban on the evidence presented.
