"Which country boasts the world's fastest growing clean energy investment? Germany? No. United States? Think again. Jumping from a few hundred million dollars to $5.7 billion, South Africa recorded last year the world's highest growth in renewable energy investment, according to the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP). The spectacular surge, led largely by investments in solar power projects, comes as South Africa moves to reduce its dependency on coal, which accounts for around 86% of its energy. To achieve that, the country has set the ambitious target of generating 18 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy by 2030. As a result, a series of investments have trickled into the country, including Google's first foray into Africa's solar power market. The internet giant, which has spent more than $1 billion in renewable energy projects in the United States and Europe in recent years, announced in late May its decision to back the Jasper Power Project, a 96 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant in Northern Cape, with a $12 million investment. Read this: 'Solar sisters' spreading light in Africa . ""We only pursue investments that we believe make financial sense,"" said Rick Needham, Google's director of energy and sustainability. ""South Africa's strong resources and supportive policies for renewable energy make it an attractive place to invest."" Abundance of sun . Once completed, Jasper is expected to be one of the biggest solar installations in the continent, capable of generating enough power for some 30,000 homes. It's no secret that Africa has plentiful sunshine, with many parts of the continent enjoying daily solar radiation of between 4 kWh and 6 kWh per square meter. But it's no secret, either, that Africa has the world's lowest electricity access rates, with more than half of its countries experiencing daily -- and costly -- power outages. Amid such conditions, experts say investments in large-scale solar power projects could transform a continent faced with fast-rising populations and increasing demand for energy to support its economic growth. ""Six out of the 10 fastest economies in the world (over the past decade) were in Africa, and that requires much more energy, at a faster-growing pace than we've seen before,"" says Frank Wouters, deputy director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency. Ambitious projects . And some countries have already taken notice. While South Africa is clearly setting the pace, projects are being announced across the continent as more countries look to unlock their massive solar potential. In late April, Mauritania launched what's described as Africa's biggest solar PV plant so far, a 15 MW facility that is designed to account for 10% of the country's energy capacity, according to its developers. In early May, Morocco began the first phase of the construction of a 160 MW concentrated solar power technology plant near Ouarzazate as part of the country's efforts to produce 2,000 MW of solar energy by 2020. And late last year, British company Blue Energy announced plans to build the Nzema Project in Ghana, a 155 MW facility. Construction at the $400 million project is expected to begin in the first quarter of next year, while the plant should become fully operational by the end of 2015. Obstacles . Yet, despite such ambitious schemes, experts say the continent is far from exploiting its massive solar energy potential. According to the International Energy Agency, coal, oil and gas together accounted for 81% of  Africa's total power generation in 2009, with nuclear power making up 2%, hydropower 16% and all other renewable sources accounting for just 1%. Read this: Harnessing pedal power to light up Africa . Wouters says that a lack of awareness about the current price competitiveness of solar technology, coupled with wider inefficiencies in the performance of most power utilities across the continent, is preventing African countries from scaling up their solar energy production. Another problem is financing, as higher up-front capital costs, longer payback periods and a lack of solar-project experience in the banking sector make access to funds more challenging. ""You need to involve banks and for many banks in Africa this is also new, so again you have to raise awareness,"" says Wouters. ""Money typically comes with a risk premium which makes it more expensive than necessary."" Actions . Others say, however, that it's inadequate policies and a lack of political commitment that prevent solar from taking off. ""The governments in Africa should change their attitude of thinking that solar is too expensive,"" says Dickens Kamughisa, chief executive of Uganda-based NGO Africa Institute for Energy Governance. ""Every decision should be based on research that can help in allocating the energy budgets."" Last year, a UNEP report said that Africa's power sector needs to install an estimated 7,000 MW of new generation capacity each year. It warned that ""unless stronger commitments and effective policy measures are taken to reverse current trends,"" half the population of sub-Saharan Africa will be without electricity in 2030. Mark Hankins, director of Kenya-based African Solar Designs, says that in order for Africa to tap its clean energy potential, solar must take center stage in the continent's energy discussions. ""There needs to be a serious reassessment of how to do policy and finance to help solar meet its potential in Africa,"" says Hankins. ""This means not just addressing the needs of poor people -- it means using solar to address the energy sector needs for on and off grid and ... using it to help business,"" he adds. ""Solar needs to be at the table, with all of the other technologies.""","Solar power projects are increasingly being announced across Africa .
Experts say that Africa can use solar power to fuel its future growth .
Lack of awareness and financing are still major challenges .
Industry insiders also call for new policies to help the sector to take off ."
"""Sesame Street's"" YouTube channel was back online and spreading wholesome, child-friendly messages Monday, a day after hackers appeared to have reprogrammed the venerable children's show pages with porn.

"A 16-year-old transgender girl in Connecticut is at the center of controversy after she was transferred to an adult prison, where she has been held for more than a month without criminal charges. ""Jane Doe,"" as she is listed in court documents, has been in the York Correctional Facility in Niantic, Connecticut, since April 8, spending the majority of her time there in solitary confinement, her attorney said. ""I tell myself that this is just a nightmare, but it doesn't end. I know that I need to work on my issues and I want to, but this is not the place,"" she wrote in an op-ed published in the Hartford Courant in late April. She was ordered to the women's prison after the state Department of Children and Families concluded that she was ""dangerous to ... herself or others or cannot be safely held,"" according to the memorandum of the judge's decision. DCF exercised a rarely used state law to persuade a judge to transfer the teen from its custody to the Department of Corrections. The court's decision cited a ""history of assaultive behavior while in placement facilities,"" which included at least 11 assaults against her peers and staff during her more than five years in DCF custody. The option to transfer ""Jane Doe"" was set in motion by DCF Commissioner Joette Katz after the teen's latest assault on a female staff worker during an out-of-state stint at a juvenile facility in Massachusetts. The incident left the staffer with a concussion and bite marks, according to reports, though no charges were pressed for the assault. ""Her behavior was more severe than other residents ... (and) made her especially dangerous and difficult to secure,"" according to testimony by a juvenile detention supervisor. 'We're not in Abu Ghraib' A grassroots movement has been launched for the teen, demanding her release from prison. ""We're not in Abu Ghraib. We're in Connecticut, in a constitution state. This is nothing short of human rights abuse,"" Aaron Romano, the teen's attorney, told CNN. ""My client is an emotionally distressed child who has been victimized by people over and over again. She's not charged with a crime, yet she was locked down in isolation, with a concrete block for her apartment, watched by guards 22 hours a day, even while she showered ... isolated from the rest of the world,"" Romano said. This week, the teen was moved to a separate facility within the prison with ""a bedroom, private bathroom and a programming/recreation area,"" DCF spokesman Gary Kleeblatt said. Doe's case has drawn attention statewide and beyond, with her supporters launching protests in New York and outside DCF headquarters in Connecticut. The hashtag #Justice4Jane was trending this month on Twitter. ""I think from the statements the (Connecticut Department of Children and Families) commissioner has made, it's clear on a fundamental level she does not understand Jane in a sympathetic light. She does not see her as a vulnerable person -- she sees her as a monster essentially,"" Chase Strangio, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT & AIDS Project, told CNN. ""You can see they are just using solitary confinement as default placement so they don't have to figure out questions about where to safely house transgender individuals,"" Strangio said. ""But we have federal law and we have our constitution that requires that these institutions and agencies take seriously the obligation to keep people safe. Placing people in solitary confinement does not meet that obligation."" Governor's support . Despite the controversy surrounding the DCF commissioner's suggestion to transfer the teen to an adult prison, Katz has received support from Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, who oversees the agency. ""The governor thinks the commissioner has done phenomenal work to transform an agency that is one of the most difficult in state government,"" Andrew Doba, a spokesman for Malloy, told CNN. ""No one thinks this is a good option for the teen, and we're working on a good resolution,"" he added. ""I admit that I have acted out and got into fights,"" Doe wrote in her op-ed in the Hartford Courant. ""I am not saying it was OK, but I have a lot of stuff built up inside me and don't know how to deal with it at times. They tell me that trauma changes people and makes them act out. Believe me, it does. I haven't agreed with everything DCF has done, but I thought they were supposed to be on my side,"" she wrote. Romano, Doe's attorney, says he is suing the state for her release. ""We are looking at other options for Jane that will better meet her treatment needs,"" DCF spokesman Kleeblatt said. The transgender community: Legally invisible no more?

"When we last saw South Carolina Congressman Francis Underwood on Netflix's ""House of Cards,"" he was being offered an appointment to the vice presidency of the United States. How much trouble can that cause? Given what Underwood did in the first season of the show, probably more than anybody anticipates. Don't expect him to be the glad-handing, funeral-attending type of VP; Underwood is more likely to be holding a knife or two, the better to stab people in the back -- or, if it's necessary, in the front. ""House of Cards,"" which helped establish Netflix as an original programmer -- rather than those folks who send you DVDs in red envelopes -- returns Friday for its second season. Like the first, it will be available for download all at once, which may mean that a lot of Valentine's Day dinners grow cold while fans binge on watching 13 straight episodes. As the second season begins, Kevin Spacey's Underwood reveals that the vice presidency won't change his cold, pragmatic cardiac muscle. ""One heartbeat away from the presidency and not a single vote cast in my name,"" he says at his swearing-in. ""Democracy is so overrated."" 'He believes ideology is a form of weakness' It's a long way from the beginning of the first season, when Underwood was denied his desired job as secretary of state. But in a long-running game of ""don't get mad, get even,"" Underwood -- with help from Doug Stamper, his subtly brutal chief of staff (Michael Kelly); Claire, his devoted and equally conniving lobbyist wife (Robin Wright); and Zoe Barnes, a pliable, ambitious reporter (Kate Mara) -- managed to knock down his obstacles and maneuver his way up the Washington food chain. If a few bodies were left in his wake -- figuratively and, in one case, literally -- well, the ends justify the means. As Underwood noted in the very first episode as he put a wounded dog out of its misery, ""I have no patience for useless things."" But that's not to say that Underwood doesn't also want to make the system work. In an interview last fall with CNN, showrunner Beau Willimon explained that Underwood, at heart, is ""an optimist,"" though he understands the darker view. 'House of Cards' creator Willimon plays a solid hand . ""Where I think people mistake his optimism for cynicism is that he's unapologetically self-interested. He believes ideology is a form of weakness -- a form of cowardice,"" Willimon said. The writer and producer observes that one of the character's models is Lyndon Johnson, known for his shrewd knowledge of the legislative process both as a senator and as president. Willimon added that ""House of Cards"" isn't necessarily a show about politics, despite its Washington setting. It's a show about power -- in all its manifestations. ""That power is displayed in our love lives, or our work environments, the way we comport ourselves when randomness brushes up against us,"" he says. And, he adds, power can be more useful than money: ""Power has no limits if you're willing to go far enough in order to get as much of it as you can."" 'Mr. Macbeth Goes to Washington'? Naturally, Willimon and his stars have been tight-lipped about how far Underwood will take things in a show The Kansas City Star nicknamed ""Mr. Macbeth Goes to Washington."" Trailers and tidbits, however, offer some tantalizing hints. There's a suggestion that Underwood could be implicated in a murder investigation. Perhaps Barnes might be locating her ethics. A New York Times Magazine profile of Willimon mentioned a ""super-duper-double-major spoiler."" And Underwood appears headed for a showdown with wealthy industrialist -- and fellow power broker -- Raymond Tusk (Gerald McRaney), a friend of the president. Just as intriguing is the future of Underwood's wife, Claire. In the first season's early episodes, she seemed more troubled by unethical behavior than her husband; after all, she was a lobbyist for environmental issues. But that changed as she found her own livelihood threatened. In this, she is much like her husband, said Wright. ""She is a pragmatist in the art of war,"" the actress told The New York Times. However the second season concludes, ""House of Cards"" has already been a winner. Netflix spent $100 million to produce the show's first two seasons. In return, the show was nominated for eight Emmy awards last fall, winning three, and Netflix's subscriber base and stock price have both hit new highs. The service has quickly become a major player for original programming, with last summer's ""Orange Is the New Black"" also earning raves. The company recently renewed ""House of Cards"" for a third season. In the meantime, one can only wonder whether a better Shakespearean parallel for Underwood is ""Othello's"" Iago, dropping poisoned hints in the president's ear. All Willimon will promise is the show will hold on to its darkness. ""There are people who don't like the level of darkness, who find the characters unsympathetic,"" he told the Times Magazine. ""And we need to own that.""","""House of Cards"" returns for second season on Friday .

"Britain's Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is going back to work, taking on a new role as an air ambulance pilot. The duke will start training in September, a year after leaving the Royal Air Force, where he flew search and rescue helicopters. He will have his first air ambulance shift in spring 2015. It's the first time a royal who's in direct line to the throne has taken a civilian job. The East Anglian Air Ambulance is operated by a private company, Bond Air Services, but the Duke will donate his salary to charity. He'll be based near his country home on the Queen's Sandringham Estate, which should allow him to remain a hands-on dad to his one-year-old heir Prince George. A palace spokesman said Prince William was ""hugely excited and motivated"" by his new job. ""The Duke sees this as a true form of public service, helping people in their most difficult times,"" the spokesman said. ""He regards his work with the RAF search and rescue force as having been an exceptional privilege and the Duke wanted to make his own contribution to the outstanding work of the air ambulance service."" The high-profile royal would have had to weigh up the risks of taking on a civilian, as opposed to military, role. Public interest could  affect not only his work, but potentially also that of medics and patients on board his aircraft. There is the heightened possibility of phone footage emerging of his rescues which could compromise privacy and security. There's also the risk of additional hoax calls. These were not a major issues whilst Prince William was a military search and rescue pilot because he was working in a remote part of west Wales and over water. The two air ambulances in East Anglia are the most widely used in the UK and operate in a built-up area. Their usual landing spots include school playing fields; residential gardens; car parks; beaches and any open space deemed possible by the pilot. William is currently on what officials have described as a ""transitional year,"" focusing on his royal duties and charitable work. He always planned to return to work and was keen that it would involve flying. Most air ambulance pilots have a military background like the Duke, who joined a squadron based at RAF Valley after qualifying as a search and rescue pilot in 2010. He undertook 156 search and rescue operations, resulting in 149 people being rescued. He is highly skilled. Andrew Egerton Smith, chairman of the East Anglian Air Ambulance said: ""Having the Duke of Cambridge as one of our pilots is marvelous news as he brings much experience to the charity after his successful career as a search and rescue pilot.  We have an outstanding track record of attending people in their hour of need which is recognized and  generously supported by our local communities."" William will spend the autumn and winter in training with the East Anglian Air Ambulance and, once qualified, will start co-piloting in the spring of next year. He will work from Cambridge and Norwich Airports doing both day and night shifts. The Duke is then expected to progress to the position of helicopter commander. The palace said the pilot role would be the Duke's ""primary occupation."" Its statement added: ""But his roster will take into account the duties and responsibilities he will continue to undertake on behalf of The Queen, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. The Duke will also continue his work with his patronages and with the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry."" The Duke has always been keen on a role beyond his royal duties whilst he is still second in line to the throne. This job will allow him to balance both positions whilst having his young family close-by. The Cambridges' country house, Anmer Hall, is being renovated and is set in idyllic rural surroundings which affords the family more privacy than their official residence at Kensington Palace, London, which is constantly monitored by photographers.","Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, has taken on a new role as an air ambulance pilot .

"A firm old English friend, an elderly one now, who lived through the Blitz, told me this when I lived in London: There is a difference between government and state. The Houses of Parliament was government and did the work. The queen was state, and represented the government free of ideology, and therefore could be a living embodiment of neutrality and frosty maternal concern for all. I didn't see it while I lived there. I was a radical Republican (anti-royalty) simply because I'm an American. But in the years since we in the Unites States have begun to cry ""impeach"" at the slightest grammatical slip of our leader, who happens to be head of both government and state, I have begun to see the practicality of a figurehead leader who has no political power, but is more eminent, always, than government. Opinion: Baby helps make a monarchy better . We have one too: She is called the Statue of Liberty. But she doesn't give birth to a real human young. The Statue of Liberty is copper, and blind. The current old Queen is blinkered, and human, and revered for her humanizing failings as well as her work ethic. There is so much about the royal family that doesn't work, but one thing it does do well is prove is that generations of squabbling citizens can indeed survive their differences and continue, persevere as a nation. The royalty is a testament to longevity of the nation, if it is nothing else. And so now there is a new baby boy. By dint of holy ignorance, a newborn child can have nothing to do with the longevity of England. The child of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and her husband, Prince William, makes immediate claim on our hope and our ability to splash out blessings simply because he is royal. But so too does any child: He or she declares the future for us. Opinion: How to raise a royal baby . Children testify to longevity, to continuity. Children, as my friend, the writer Jill Paton Walsh, once wrote, ""stand in a different relationship to time"" than we do. They have eternity where we have actuarial tables. This particular baby, with the Lion and the Unicorn hand-stitched into his nappies, this child too stands in for that nation's hope for all children: that they will thrive, somehow, against all odds. By extension, because babies provide us older types a kind of vitamin nutrition we can get from no other source, we have to smile, too. We Americans love our children as much as the British. We love to hope for their future, for all of them.","Gregory Maguire: In UK, Parliament is government, queen is 'state' -- concern for subjects .

"In Wimbledon's second week, tennis seems to be all over the place, even in the sewer.  On Thursday, engineers arrived in the English town of Melton Mowbray to unclog a blocked sewer intake that was causing floods in the area.  The root of the problem left experts puzzled, according to BBC News.  Piled up in a grate, under a layer of waste, were hundreds of tennis balls. ""We expect sewers to get blocked with fats or baby wipes,"" said sewerage network manager Scott Burgin to the BBC.  ""But not tennis balls."" Staff from the Severn Trent Water firm were dispatched to clear the blockage, using both shovels and their hands.  But if history is any indicator of what is to come, they will soon be back. ""How on Earth people have managed to flush quite so many (balls), I don't know, but this is just one example of amazing things we find blocking the sewers,"" Burgin said. According to The Independent, the list is nothing short of ""staggering.""  Perhaps the most ironic denizen of the British sewers was a large Pooh, a stuffed Winnie the Pooh teddy bear, that is. Pooh's subterranean counterparts found blocking drains and manholes include a pair of trousers, a snake, a traffic cone, a tractor tire, a still-functional clothing iron, a live badger, a mattress and a fully grown dead cow, The Independent reported. These drains are not large, either. ""The wastewater drain which runs from your house to the public sewer is usually only about four inches wide, which is less than the diameter of a DVD,"" Chris Wallace, director of communications at Scottish Water, told The Independent. According to the BBC, Severn Trent Water said around 75% of sewer blockages stem from foreign objects (see: Winnie the Pooh, hundreds of tennis balls) introduced into the system.","Tennis balls cause sewer blockage, flooding .

"(CNN)The mother of Chinese tennis Li Na is expecting a baby. The two-time grand slam champion, who retired from tennis in 2014, chose to start spreading the news about her pregnancy at the Australian Open in the Rod Laver Stadium. ""Me and Dennis, we are so excited,"" the 32-year-old Li said, referring to her husband, in an on-court ceremony at the Melbourne tournament where she won her second grand slam in 2014. ""I think Dennis is doing a good job,"" she added, before quipping, ""He just made one ace."" Often the butt of Li's sense of humor, her husband  was in the stands as China's pioneering tennis player revealed the impending arrival of the couple's first child this summer. After retiring in September 2014 due to chronic knee problems, the tennis star has made having a family a priority, telling CNN's Pat Cash in an interview on Sunday that ""family for me is the most important thing."" Li triumphed at both the French (2011) and the Australian Open (2014) to become the highest ranked Asian player the world has seen, peaking at number two in the world.. She later took to Facebook to talk more about her excitement at the prospect of becoming a mother. ""This summer, Dennis and I are expecting our first child. We are overjoyed!"" she wrote. ""I've been feeling great and Dennis and I have been doing some traveling and enjoying this special time in our lives. We can't wait to become parents and start this new chapter together."" Referring to the Melbourne crowd, she added: ""It really feels like this baby is going to enter the world already having about 15,000 friends."" Not just 15,000 friends -- there's also China's 1.3 billion population after Li's sporting success made her a household name in the country of her birth. It's estimated that over 100 million Chinese watched the live TV coverage of her 2011 French Open win, reportedly the biggest TV audience for a single sports event in China. Back at the Australian Open all eyes were on Li after decision to announce her news at the Melbourne event.

"(CNN) -- Serbia is ""ready to talk"" with Kosovo and ""we will do so in good faith,"" Serbia's president told the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday. ""Soon the two parties will be talking to each other for the first time in many years,"" said President Boris Tadic. ""We must be patient and seek out those issues which allow confidence to be built on each side,"" he added. ""There will be many issues to discuss and some of them will be complicated. You all can contribute to an atmosphere that creates trust."" Kosovo had long been a restive province of Serbia with a majority ethnic Albanian population until it declared independence in Feburary 2008. This followed a civil war that raged in the 1990s between Kosovo Albanian insurgents and Serb security forces and Belgrade-backed Kosovo Serb paramilitaries. After that, the region operated under a U.N. mission and a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Serbia and many ethnic Serbs staunchly opposed the Kosovo independence move regard Kosovo as Serbian territory and refuse to recognize its sovereignty. Tadic said ""Serbia's position remains unchanged"" and that the ""unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo"" won't be recognized. Kosovo is recognized by dozens of countries, including the United States. But Russia backs Serbia in rejecting its independence. Russia, a traditional Serb ally, also opposed NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999. The U.N. General Assembly recently adopted a landmark resolution calling for talks between Serbia and Kosovo, and the International Court of Justice recently ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence ""did not violate general international law."" Serbia, which says ""statehood has never been attained without the consent of the parent state,"" says there is not yet a ""clear settlement"" of the Serbian-Kosovo matter. He said it is critically important that the U.N. member states that have not recognized Kosovo's independence ""to stay on the course of non-recognition"" during talks. ""This will be a significant contribution to ensuring that unilateral attempts to impose outcomes to ethnic and territorial disputes are not legitimized,"" he said.","Boris Tadic delivers address to U.N.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Four people were killed Saturday and more than 43 others were injured, four critically, after a Russian passenger jet caught fire shortly before takeoff, authorities said. One of the engines aboard the Tu-154B-2 caught fire as the plane taxied toward the runway in Russia's Siberian city of Surgut, Russia's Investigation Committee said in a statement on its website. The blaze quickly spread throughout the cabin, forcing passengers to evacuate as the aircraft became engulfed in flames. After the passengers evacuated, the fuel tanks exploded, causing massive devastation to the aircraft, a spokeswoman for the local branch of the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said on state television. Photos on state-run newswire RIA-Novosti's website showed only the tail of the plane recognizable amid a huge plume of black smoke. The aircraft, which was destined for Moscow, about 1,800 miles away, was carrying 135 people -- 117 passengers and 18 crew members, the Russian Health and Social Development Ministry said. Earlier, it was reported that 124 people were on board. A popular Russian pop group, Na-Na, was on the flight. The plane was flown by Kogalymavia Airlines, according to RIA-Novosti. The aircraft's last overhaul was in 1998, according to Russian state television. A pre-flight check found it to be in good condition, state TV said. Authorities have launched a criminal investigation based on charges of violating transport and fire safety rules, the investigative committee said. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report .","Russian pop music group was on flight .

"The sometimes violent protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and the law enforcement response has sparked a debate about what some call the ""militarization of police,"" after armored vehicles, stun grenades and high-tech weaponry were brought in to calm the violence. Some of the equipment may be military surplus that came from the federal government through a program from the Defense Department's Defense Logistics Agency, which provides military equipment to local police departments across the country. The DLA's law enforcement support program was created in 1999. ""This is a program legislated by Congress which allows the secretary to transfer some excess military property to local law enforcements,"" said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby on Tuesday. Kirby said since 2007 the Ferguson Police Department has received two Humvees, one generator, and one cargo trailer. Over the same time period, the St. Louis County Police Department received six pistols, 12 rifles, 15 weapon sites, an explosives disposal robot, three helicopters, seven Humvees (two used by Ferguson Police), and two night-vision devices. ""It's still up to local law enforcement to determine how and when and where and under what circumstances they use excess military equipment,"" said Kirby,  but Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ""has been mindful of the public debate and discussion about this issue and asked his staff this morning about some additional information about this program."" According to Kirby, Hagel has received an information paper with more details on the program, but has yet to order a formal review.  Hagel wants a better understanding of the law and regulations governing the transfer program and what parts of that program are the responsibility of the Defense Department. The program has been in place for several years with little controversy and attention, but has grabbed the national spotlight with the unrest in Ferguson, where police have used what looks like tactical military gear and vehicles, although it's not clear what equipment may have actually come from Pentagon inventories. Complete coverage on Ferguson shooting and protests . Pentagon officials say a key issue for the department is the fact that once the equipment is transferred, the military has no control over how a local agency uses it. Many police departments also get funding for military-style equipment from Homeland Security and the Justice Department, which operate programs aimed at beefing up police capability in the event of a terrorist attack. President Barack Obama called for a review of the program on Monday. ""I think it's probably useful for to us review how the funding has gone, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars to make sure that what they are purchasing is stuff that they actually need. Because there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement and we don't want those lines blurred, that would be contrary to our traditions and I think that there will be some bipartisan interest in reexamining some of those programs."" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee, said his committee would ""review this program to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended.""

"(CNN) -- The alleged terror incident aboard a passenger flight from Amsterdam to Detroit has raised questions as to how a  Nigerian man carried explosives through stringent security measures. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab has been charged with attempting to destroy a passenger plane after he detonated a device on board a jet on Friday. Authorities in the United States are investigating whether Abdulmutallab had any connections with terrorist organizations or was acting alone. Airports intensify security after plane attack . With Dutch officials scrutinizing security procedures at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport that allowed the 23-year-old man to smuggle the explosives on the aircraft -- here are some of the key questions still hanging over the incident. Where did the explosives come from? The man charged with igniting the device claims he obtained the explosives in Yemen, along with instruction on how to use it. He carried these onto a flight from Lagos, Nigeria, to Amsterdam, Netherlands where he transferred to Northwest Flight 253 to Detroit. Was he on any security watch lists? U.S. authorities say they were contacted by the man's father ahead of the attack, but whether he was placed on any so-called No-Fly list maintained by the United States is unclear. Dutch officials say the passenger's name appeared on a manifest supplied by the airline, which was passed to U.S. authorities, who cleared the flight to depart. Were the proper security checks performed? Yes, say Dutch authorities, who say he passed through normal procedures and that ""security was well-performed."" He is known to have passed through a metal detector and his luggage was X-rayed. Extra attention is normally applied to passengers arriving from Nigeria because of concerns over fraud and smuggling. Nevertheless airports around the world have stepped up security procedures in the wake of the incident, increasing pat-downs and secondary searches. So how did the explosives get through? Dutch authorities are at pains to point out that if the passenger had powders concealed upon his person or secreted bottles of liquid somewhere else, they certainly would not have been picked up by the metal detector. Is there any way of detecting these kind of explosives? A preliminary FBI analysis indicates the device contained PETN, also known as Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate, a highly explosive chemical. Experts say this would have been picked up using a swab commonly used in secondary screening. A body scan, particularly the new 3D imaging scanners being trailed at some airports, would also have spotted something strapped to his body, even in the crotch area. Why were there no U.S. air marshal security officers on the flight? U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CNN federal air marshals are not posted on all flights. She said this was not due to budgetary constraints, but down to standard procedures, which see marshals posted randomly on certain routes. CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Richard Quest and Barry Neild contributed to this report.","Dutch authorities say normal security procedures were carried out .

"Earlier this month Formula One's governing body punished Pirelli and Mercedes for holding an unsanctioned tire test  -- at the British Grand Prix it was Pirelli meting out punishment to the elite racing series. British home hope Lewis Hamilton lost the lead when the left-rear tire of his Mercedes began to unravel on the eighth lap at the demanding Silverstone circuit. It was the first of four incidents as Ferrari's Felipe Massa, Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne and McLaren's Sergio Perez also had their races ruined by failures to the exact same tire. Hamilton -- and the 130,000 British fans who streamed into Silverstone to support the 2008 world champion -- were left counting the cost more than most. His problem handed Sebastian Vettel the race lead and Red Bull's defending world champion marched ominously towards the checkered flag. But there was a final twist -- and a dash of retribution for Mercedes -- as Vettel's Red Bull ground to a halt with 10 laps to go. ""We had a gearbox issue,"" said the German, who now leads the championship by 21 points from Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. ""Fifth gear broke and it was not possible to carry on. It was quite disappointing to stop and retire."" The Mercedes of Nico Rosberg inherited the lead from Vettel and the German, who celebrated his 28th birthday this weekend, raced to his first British GP victory and second of the season. ""When Seb stopped, I won't lie, I wasn't disappointed,"" smiled Rosberg, winner of the Monaco GP. ""I definitely feel sorry for the British fans as it would have been a great ace for Lewis. ""But there were too many tire failures today and they need to look into that."" Mark Webber, who announced he was retiring from the sport at the end of the year, recovered from a dismal start to claim a brilliant second in his last-ever F1 race on British soil. ""The start was a big negative for us and then [Romain] Grosjean touched my front wing at Turn One and the race reset from there,"" Webber explained. ""I pushed very hard to do the business and in the end it was a very, very good result. It's been a real highlight for me to race at this circuit."" Ferrari's Fernando Alonso followed the Australian home and the Spaniard said he considered himself ""lucky"" to have avoided the tire issues that hit other drivers. ""It was a lucky race for us,"" said Alonso. ""We recovered some points but we need to raise our game as our pace is not good enough."" There was some world-class racing in the final laps. Hamilton fought his way back through the field to finish fourth ahead of Lotus driver Kimi Raikkonen, who is nine points ahead of the Briton in the championship. Rosberg reprimand . But regardless of the driving drama, tire failures dominated the fall-out from the British race --- even Vettel's first retirement in 12 months seemed to dip under the radar. In the immediate aftermath of the race, Pirelli responded to serious safety concerns as the drivers questioned whether they were pushing themselves and their cars to the limit in safe conditions. ""Someone could've crashed,"" said Hamilton. ""I was thinking behind the safety car that it's only when someone gets hurt that something will be done about it."" Massa, who was running in fourth before his tire failure, added: ""What happened is unacceptable. ""It was very dangerous for all of the 22 drivers racing. In order for us to race we cannot have these problems. They need to do something for our safety."" In a short media conference after the race, Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery explained: ""Today wasn't foreseen. We've seen a different type of problem. ""We are still doing our analysis so we have to go away and understand what's happened and get to the core of the issue. We take these things seriously. It was one tire, the left rear. When we have the answer we'll let you know."" Pirelli had wanted to introduce a new tire construction at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier this month but failed to get all the teams to agree to the change at a meeting in Monaco. The weakness of the tires had been masked in Montreal but the high-speed nature of the Silverstone circuit in the heart of England brutally exposed their frailties. ""Pirelli appeared to come up with a solution with a different construction and that was being offered from Montreal,"" said Red Bull's chief technical officer Adrian Newey. ""Two or three teams vetoed that because they were worried it would suit other teams more than them and because of that short-sightedness we have F1 putting on the worrying performance it did today and concerns over driver safety."" The sport's governing body, the FIA, are coming under pressure to force through a change in tires with or without the consent of the teams. As a result, the issue is due to be on the agenda at a meeting of the Sporting Working Committee on Wednesday ahead of the German Grand Prix with Pirelli invited to attend by the FIA. Later Sunday Rosberg was subsequently handed a reprimand after the race for failing to reduce his speed under yellow flags, which are waved to warn drivers to slow down, but no further sanction was imposed.","Nico Rosberg wins British Grand Prix for first time .

"(CNN)Even though Rafael Nadal had beaten his first-round opponent at the Australian Open, Mikhail Youzhny, five straight times, the Spaniard wasn't sure what to expect when they played Monday. After all Nadal last competed at a major at Wimbledon and had lost both singles matches that he contested this year as he returned from appendix surgery. Nadal -- who also suffered from back and wrist injuries in 2014 -- cast doubt on his Australian Open participation just last week. Youzhny, too, owned four victories over the 14-time grand slam champion. But in a score that is sure to have his rivals taking note, the Spaniard crushed the former top-10 regular 6-3 6-2 6-2. ""Very positive result for me,"" Nadal told reporters. ""I think very good start. ""Always before the first match you have the doubts, especially in this situation I'm arriving here. Never easy, but it was an important match for me. Was a comfortable victory that give me some confidence."" Nadal habitually lingers on court even when he wins in straight sets but he needed just one hour, 50 minutes to dispose of the veteran Russian. He only faced one break point, dropped four points behind his first serve and struck 22 more winners than unforced errors. ""I think I returned well,"" said the 2014 finalist. ""My return worked really well. The serve, too. I served, I think, the right way, with only one break point during the whole match. And in general I played with not many mistakes."" Nadal could face Roger Federer in the semifinals, and the Swiss began his charge with a 6-4 6-2 7-5 win over Yen-Hsun Lu. Lu has upset the likes of Andy Murray, Andy Roddick and David Nalbandian in the past but he only really challenged the 17-time grand slam winner in the third set. An attacking Federer -- appearing in a record extending 61st straight major -- approached the net more than 40 times, winning 70% of those points. Nadal and Federer were joined in the second round by two-time grand slam winner Murray, although an outside contender for the women's draw, Ana Ivanovic, fell. There was a time when many thought the former No. 1 would never return to the top 10 and top five but 2013 and 2014 saw the Serb re-climb the rankings. And last week, she extended Maria Sharapova to three sets in a final in Brisbane. Her goal in 2015, she said, was to perform her best at the grand slams, yet Monday's 1-6 6-3 6-2 loss to Czech qualifier Lucie Hradecka means she still hasn't figured things out. Ivanovic heavily contributed to her downfall, hitting 10 double faults. It's now only one grand slam quarterfinal for Ivanovic in her past nine attempts. ""It's really disappointing,"" Ivanovic told reporters. ""It's probably the worst thing that could happen. ""I really have to now sit and work on few things and just maybe try to have a different approach to this kind of event and try to see what was lacking."" Ivanovic admitted to nerves prior to the encounter, as did third-seed Simona Halep ahead of her match against Karin Knapp. But the fast-rising Halep overcame the nerves and eased past the Italian 6-3 6-2. Sharapova, bidding for a first major outside the French Open in seven years, defeated Petra Martic 6-4 6-1. Halep's reward is a second-round clash with Aussie Jarmila Gajdosova, who snapped a long drought at her home major. Having lost all nine of her previous matches in Melbourne, the big-serving Gajdosova ousted Halep's fellow Romanian Alexandra Dulgheru 6-3 6-4. ""I was talking to my coach and I told him I actually did feel like I won the Australian Open,"" Gajdosova said. ""It was just the first round but it's been such a long time coming. Not to be able to do it in your home Grand Slam was very devastating for me."" Later, there was more joy for Australia as two of its brightest prospects won five setters. First Thanasi Kokkinakis upset 11th seed Ernests Gulbis 5-7 6-0 1-6 7-6 (2) 8-6. Kokkinakis -- who saved four match points in the fourth -- celebrated by doing a victory lap. Not long after and past midnight in Melbourne, Nick Kyrgios -- Nadal's conqueror at Wimbledon -- edged Federico Delbonis 7-6 (2) 3-6 6-3 6-7 (5) 6-3.","Rafael Nadal crushes Mikhail Youzhny at the Australian Open .

"After years of thinking it over, Floyd Corkins finally had a plan. He'd bought a gun and learned how to use it. He'd loaded three magazines. And he had stopped by Chick-fil-A to pick up 15 sandwiches, which he planned to smear in the dying faces of staffers he expected to kill at the Family Research Council in Washington. It would be a statement, he said, ""against the people who work in that building,"" according to documents filed in U.S. District Court, where Corkins pleaded guilty on Wednesday to three charges related to the August shooting at the conservative policy group. Corkins told Judge Richard Roberts that he hoped to intimidate gay rights opponents. The shooting came amid intense debate over remarks against gay marriage by an executive with the Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A restaurant chain and the company's support for groups considered hostile to gay rights. The research council, a Christian group that focuses on family, anti-abortion and religious liberty issues and views homosexuality as harmful, backed Chick-fil-A in the ensuing controversy. ""They endorse Chick-fil-A and also Chick-fil-A came out against gay marriage, so I was going to use that as a statement,"" prosecutors quoted Corkins as telling investigators. Corkins, 28, pleaded guilty to committing an act of terrorism while armed, interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition, and assault with intent to kill while armed. Prosecutors dropped seven other charges. The charges carry sentences of up to 70 years in prison. However, the sentence could be shorter because Corkins has no prior criminal record. Corkins will be sentenced April 29, prosecutors said. The act of terrorism charge alleges that Corkins wanted to kill building manager Leo Johnson and other Family Research Council employees ""with the intent to intimidate and coerce a significant portion of the civilian population of the District of Columbia and the United States."" It is a District of Columbia law passed in 2002 but never before used. According to prosecutors' account of the attack filed on Wednesday, Corkins got into the Family Research Council's building by telling Johnson that he was there to interview for an internship. After Johnson asked for identification, prosecutors say, Corkins reached into his backpack, retrieved a handgun and leveled it at Johnson's head. Johnson ducked and lunged at Corkins before he could fire a shot, according to prosecutors. As the two struggled, Corkins fired three times, hitting Johnson once in the arm, before the building manager was able to wrestle him to the ground, disarm him and hold him at gunpoint until police arrived. As he lay on the ground, Corkins said something to the effect, ""'It's not about you.' It's about the FRC and its policies,"" according to the prosecution account. Corkins -- who had chosen the research council as his target after finding it listed as an anti-gay group on the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center -- had planned to stride into the building and open fire on the people inside in an effort to kill as many as possible, he told investigators, according to the court documents. If he'd been successful and escaped, his plan was to go to another conservative group to continue the attack, prosecutors said. A handwritten list naming three other groups he planned to attack was found among his belongings, prosecutors said. According to the documents, Corkins had thought about such an attack for years but ""just never went through with it."" He purchased the gun used in the attack a week before at a Virginia gun store, where a French television crew taped him while doing a story about the widespread availability of guns in America, according to prosecutors. He also went to the store the day before the attack for two hours of training. U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen said Corkins' guilty plea ""makes clear that using violence to terrorize political opponents will not be tolerated."" At the time of the shooting, Corkins lived with his parents in Herndon, Virginia, and volunteered at a Washington center for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. In August, FBI investigators said in an affidavit that investigators had interviewed Corkins' parents after the shooting, and they said their son ""has strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner."" The Southern Poverty Law Center has listed the Family Research Council as a hate group since 2010, pointing to what it describes as its anti-gay propaganda and legislative agenda. On his nightly radio show on Wednesday, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins mentioned the plea deal and accused the Southern Poverty Law Center of playing a role in the shooting by inciting hatred and violence rather than fighting it -- a claim he has repeatedly made since the shooting. ""The Southern Poverty Law Center is dangerous. They are inciting hatred, and in this case a clear connection to violence,"" he said on the radio broadcast. ""They need to be held accountable, and they need to be stopped before people are killed because of their reckless labeling and advocacy for homosexuality and their anti-Christian stance."" A spokeswoman for the center declined to comment on the plea deal or the research council's comments, but referred to a statement from the organization last year, standing by its designation of the Family Research Council as a ""hate group."" ""As people who care about human dignity, we have a moral obligation to call out the FRC for its demonizing lies and incendiary rhetoric about the LGBT community,"" the statement said. ""The fact that we list the FRC as a hate group because of its demonizing propaganda does not make us the hateful one. Spreading demonizing lies is what is dangerous, not exposing them.""","The president of the FRC accuses the Southern Poverty Law Center of ""inciting violence""

"(CNN)Income inequality is like the weather: Everyone talks about it, but no one does much about it. Now comes President Obama in his State of the Union Address, hoping to do more than just talk about it. The President tackles this perennial conundrum by proposing that the tax code be changed in two very distinct directions: 1) Provide extra money to low- and middle-income families in the form of tax credits for children and working couples. 2) raise taxes on upper-income taxpayers, especially the fabled ""one percent"" through various cutbacks and increased restrictions on savings. It is certainly easy to dismiss his suggestions given the makeup of the new Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, but stranger concoctions have been enacted when major tax overhauls are undertaken. So what does the President suggest? First, he wants to triple child care tax credits for children under age 5, thereby supercharging an existing provision that Republicans and conservatives have generally championed to make the tax system more ""family-friendly."" Second, he proposes a $500 tax credit for married couples when both spouses are employed, an idea that essentially replicates a provision that was enacted during President Ronald Reagan's first year. The majority party in Congress may not be particularly enthralled with President Obama's caveat that this credit phase out when a family's annual income reaches $120,000, but such parameters can be negotiated as legislation gets developed. The tax changes on upper-income taxpayers are more likely to generate partisan resistance. As a general matter, Republicans want to lower or even eliminate taxes on capital gains, and this position has been party dogma since the first Bush administration. In contrast, President Obama proposes to raise taxes on capital gains received by married couples with incomes exceeding $500,000 per year. That income level may be above most people's conception of ""middle class,"" but it is far below what it takes to be a ""one-percenter."" Nevertheless, if one wants to address anomalies like Warren Buffett and Mitt Romney paying lower effective tax rates than their employees, then raising tax rates on capital gains is a necessity. But President Obama goes much further and attacks the so-called ""step-up in basis"" rule -- which the White House calls the ""trust fund loophole"" -- that allows gains on inherited property to go untaxed, regardless of amount. Targeting this longstanding tax rule takes aim not at those who have worked hard to create businesses and build wealth, but at those whose pathway to riches was having the right relatives. Obama's proposal, in other words, seeks to reduce wealth disparities without disincentivizing the job creators among us. Along these lines, he also proposes that no tax be due on inherited family-operated businesses until they are sold. That said, this proposal is no slam dunk. As recent battles over the estate tax have demonstrated, Americans do not particularly like the federal government claiming to level the proverbial playing field by confiscating family wealth. Surveys repeatedly show that resentment of the rich is simply not as strong as some politicians seem to believe. In any case, the ""step-up in basis"" rule was effectively repealed in 1976, but Congress then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively.  Nearly two decades later, an effort very similar to President Obama's proposal was put forth during President Clinton's first few months in office, but the response then was also swift and negative. Will this time be different? Perhaps the sense among some citizens that the system is ""rigged"" will produce a different result this year, but income inequality is fundamentally not a problem that is exclusively or even primarily about taxation. Causes range from globalization and unfair trade agreements to falling educational achievement and the decline of private sector labor unions, among others. Tweaking the tax code, even in the substantial and perhaps radical ways that President Obama is due to propose on Tuesday, can go only so far in addressing this issue. On the other hand, the U.S. tax code is one part of the puzzle that the federal government can control and do something about in fairly short order. Tackling tax reform more broadly could be a pathway to bipartisan cooperation that creates a genuine achievement for both President Obama and the new Congress. In that context, repealing the ""step-up in basis"" rule and perhaps equalizing tax rates on capital gains and regular income would go a long way to simplifying tax planning and return preparation while allowing the market to allocate capital without the often nonsensical preferences embedded in the current tax code. That is certainly a worthy project. But it is a very different focus than trying to ameliorate income inequality. Regarding the latter, even if President Obama's tax proposals are enacted exactly as he set out, they may not do much about income inequality in the United States, but they at least do more than just talk about it.","Richard Kaplan says tax law changes can reduce inequality to a degree .
He says Obama's effort to end ""trust-fund loophole"" is a tough sell .

"(CNN)Gov. Bobby Jindal has been speaking in London recently, and he startled quite a number of people in the House of Commons when he talked about ""no-go zones"" in Britain, places where Sharia law trumps British law. He announced confidently to a group that included a number of British parliamentarians that the police in the United Kingdom don't dare to tread in these zones, where Sharia law is widely used.  ""Nonassimilationist Muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of Sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home,"" he said. This is the sort of ill-informed fantasy that plays well in certain right-wing circles. This probably works for Jindal back home in Louisiana. Oddly enough, Fox News got into trouble recently on the ""no-go zone"" nonsense, too, as when Steve Emerson, a so-called terrorism expert, explained to the American masses that Birmingham, a major British urban center, was populated entirely by Muslims and that ""non-Muslims just simply don't go in."" British Prime Minister David Cameron correctly labeled him ""a complete idiot,"" and Emerson's remark caused a spokesperson for the network to admit that Muslim ""no-go zones"" don't actually exist, not in Britain, not in Europe. Needless to say, there are places where a lot of Muslim immigrants live in close proximity, and outsiders might feel uncomfortable walking around.  The same would be true for parts of America where you might feel uncomfortable walking around if you were, say, black or white -- it would depend on the neighborhood.  (An African American colleague of mine recently told me that her sons, in their 20s, often feel threatened in white neighborhoods, and I don't doubt the truth of this.) It's not unusual for socio-economic, even racial or ethnic, groups to cluster.  My own grandparents came to the United States as immigrants in 1912, and they lived for some years in Italian ghettos in New York.  Most immigrant groups start in ghettos somewhere, and many of them never get out. But the question of Sharia law is interesting.  Unofficial Sharia courts will be found in Europe, here and there.  But these arbitration bodies don't trump the legal system of the country where they occur.  An article in The Economist noted, in fact, that there have long been rabbinical courts in Jewish neighborhoods in Britain -- not a dissimilar sort of thing. There are even places in the United States where Christians can work out their disputes in a kind of extrajudicial manner. Family law, for instance, is often the issue here, and there are cultural values that play into the need for this kind of culturally inflected arbitration. That in some Muslim neighborhoods there might be an accommodation to Sharia law seems not surprising, and this doesn't mean that sooner or later we can expect adulterous women to be stoned to death in Birmingham or thieves to have their hands lopped off in East London. Blasphemy will not soon lead to the gas chamber in Europe -- indeed, capital punishment is not legal in any European country (or any civilized country, for that matter, except for the USA). Getting back to Gov. Jindal, one has to wonder what prompted his ignorant outburst.  Was this a lame attempt to play into the broad public fears of radical Islam that have arisen in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo killings?  If so, that's not good enough for a politician with any shred of integrity. In my view, Jindal immediately disqualified himself from ever holding a national political office by making such a bizarre statement, though it hasn't stopped any number of American politicians with bizarre notions from winning major national offices in the past.  Such behavior does, however, embarrass this country in the court of world opinion. The British, and most European countries, have struggled to accommodate Muslim immigrants, but they have nevertheless welcomed them in large numbers. For the most part, these immigrants have behaved well, despite the fear of their traditions and beliefs that leads to crazy exaggerations by politicians such as Jindal. There have been isolated and gruesome incidents of terrorism -- the murder of a British soldier, Lee Rigby, in the spring of 2013 comes to mind, or the vicious attacks in London of July 7, 2005, which left 52 dead and over 700 injured. The British have had to confront terror, and they've done so without vilifying large parts of their own population.  Indeed, they've been forced to come to terms with what I would call British Exceptionalism -- the old imperial feeling that nobody who is not British can possibly lead a civilized way of life.  (As Americans, of course, we struggle with our own feelings of exceptionalism, preferring to think that our ways are always the best and truest ways.) Jindal was apparently on a 10-day ""fact finding"" mission designed to bolster his credentials for a possible run at the White House in 2016.  He's not as stupid as he sounds, in fact.  (Indeed, he was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, where he must have learned something.) Let's hope that he is a quick study, and that he learns how not to say idiotic things in public that cause a good deal of offense, if not harm, to unsuspecting people, fueling hatred rather than coming to terms.","In Britain, Gov.

"Carlos Enrique Londoño laughs at the Ku Klux Klan recruitment flier recently left on the driveway of his suburban New York home. It's unlikely the group would accept him. ""I'm Colombian and dark-skinned,"" said Londoño, a painter and construction worker who has lived in Hampton Bays on Long Island for 30 years. The flier was tucked into a plastic bag along with a membership application, the address for the KKK national office in North Carolina, a list of beliefs and three Jolly Rancher candies. The packages appear to be part of a wider recruitment effort by the Klan across the country, Ryan Lenz, senior writer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, told CNN on Saturday. Similar fliers have turned up in dozens of U.S. cities over the past six months, Lenz said. The SPLC was founded by civil rights lawyers, and is known for tracking and exposing the activities of such groups. The SPLC says the Ku Klux Klan is the most infamous and oldest of American hate groups. African-Americans have been the main target of the historically violent group, but the Klan also has targeted Jews, immigrants, gays, lesbians and Catholics. The center estimates that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 Klan members nationwide, divided among dozens of divergent and warring groups. ""Since the 1970s the Klan has been greatly weakened by internal conflicts, court cases, a seemingly endless series of splits and government infiltration,"" the SPLC says on its website. The Klan's Loyal White Knights, the same group touted on the applications sprinkled on front lawns in Hampton Bays, has started major recruitment efforts, according to Lenz. Renewed efforts after Ferguson shooting, unrest? Lenz suspects the Klan may be seizing on a moment when the issues of race and immigration are dominant in the national debate. The group may be seeking to capitalize on growing racial tension to garner support, he said. Some Klan members even vowed to head to Ferguson, Missouri, to stand in the solidarity with a white police officer who shot an unarmed black teenager on August 9, Lenz said. The shooting death drew international attention as the St. Louis suburb erupted with sometimes violent protests and a heavy-handed police response. Calls seeking comment from Klan headquarters in Pelham, North Carolina, were not returned Saturday. In New York, the Southampton Town Police said it had contacted the Suffolk County Police Department's hate crimes unit about the fliers. Londoño said the Klan appeared eager to send a message in the predominantly white town. ""It seems they want the white community to know that Latinos are moving in,""  he said. ""People are coming here for the work and that does not sit well with them and they feel intimidated."" Hampton Bays resident Karen Fritsch said the fliers included faded-ink ""crude (and) ridiculous"" caricatures that appeared aimed at blacks, Latinos and Jewish people.

In Orange, California, just south of Angel Stadium, residents last month received fliers in sealed plastic bags, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. The message on the fliers was ""Save our land, join the Klan"" and included a phone number and website in Pelham, KTLA reported. The group said it was focused on illegal immigration from Mexico. The voicemail on the hotline associated with the flier closes with the message: ""Always remember: If it ain't white, it ain't right. White power."" In Seneca, South Carolina, some residents last month received bags with fliers and candy, CNN affiliate WHNS reported. The packages directed people to a ""Klan Hotline"" number that ended with the same recorded ""white power"" message, the station reported. Robert Jones, the ""Imperial Klaliff"" of the Loyal White Knights sect, told WHNS that the effort was part of the Klan's ""national night ride"" -- a recruitment event that happens three times a year. Jones said recruitment efforts were not aimed at specific people and that residents ""shouldn't be fearful unless they're doing something that the Klan considers morally wrong,"" according to WHNS. In Katy, Texas, residents early last month received fliers inviting them to ""join the fight to protect U.S. borders,"" according to CNN affiliate KPRC. Damian Neveaux, who is African-American, found a flier and called the number because he, too, was concerned about border security, KPRC reported. He reached a Klan representative who told him he would not be allowed to join.

"Days before he became the first person diagnosed with Ebola on American soil, Thomas Eric Duncan answered ""no"" to questions about whether he had cared for a patient with the deadly virus. Before leaving Liberia, Duncan also answered no to a question about whether he had touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease, said Binyah Kesselly, board chairman of the Liberia Airport Authority. Witnesses say Duncan had been helping Ebola patients in Liberia. Liberian community leader Tugbeh Chieh Tugbeh said Duncan was caring for an Ebola-infected patient at a residence in Paynesville City, just outside Monrovia. Earlier Thursday, Kesselly told CNN that the authority ""will seek to prosecute"" if Duncan lied on his health screening questionnaire before leaving West Africa. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told Canadian public broadcaster CBC on Thursday that she would consult with lawyers to decide what to do with Duncan when he returns home. ""The fact that he knew (he was exposed to the virus) and he left the country is unpardonable, quite frankly,"" Johnson Sirleaf told CBC. ""I just hope that nobody else gets infected."" ""With the U.S. doing so much to help us fight Ebola, and again one of our compatriots didn't take due care, and so, he's gone there and ... put some Americans in a state of fear, and put them at some risk, and so I feel very saddened by that and very angry with him, to tell you the truth."" Duncan's family said he hadn't mentioned any exposure to Ebola in Liberia. His girlfriend says he told her he hadn't been in contact with anyone with Ebola. Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, said Thursday that he doesn't believe Duncan knew he had Ebola when he left Liberia for the United States. But he said it isn't out of the ordinary to come to the assistance of suffering people. Asked about whether Duncan had contact with Ebola patients, he said, ""(it's) what we do in Liberia -- our tradition is to help somebody who needs help."" Ebola reaches U.S.: A tragedy of errors . Complete coverage on Ebola . Screened several times before leaving Liberia . The health questionnaire typically contains questions about the passenger's recent contact with Ebola patients. Passengers also are asked whether they've experienced any symptoms consistent with Ebola, such as vomiting, diarrhea or joint pain, in the past couple of days. Duncan was screened three times before he boarded his flight in Liberia to Brussels, Kesselly said. ""The first screening was at the gate, before you get to the parking lot. The second time is before you enter the terminal building and the third is before you board the flight. At every point your temperature is scanned."" His temperature at those checkpoints was a consistent 97.3 degrees Fahrenheit, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Thomas Frieden told reporters Thursday. ""Basically, he didn't have a fever,"" Frieden said, noting that the Ebola patient's temperature was taken by a trained CDC health care worker with a thermometer approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Kesselly said airport authority would seek to prosecute Duncan ""if it is determined that he made a false declaration during the health screening questionnaire."" ""We cannot make the (Ebola) risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in West Africa,"" said Frieden. He went on to say that isolating West African countries completely through travel restrictions would make it more difficult to assist in controlling the outbreak, and would eventually put the United States at greater risk. Family quarantined . Duncan is in serious condition at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. So far, no one who had contact with Duncan has shown any indication of having contracted Ebola, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins told reporters Thursday. Smallwood said that when Duncan first visited Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, neither Duncan nor the hospital knew then that he had Ebola. This was Duncan's first time in the United States, Smallwood said. The Liberian national was visiting his son and his son's mother in Dallas, Smallwood said. The partner of Duncan has been quarantined in her Dallas apartment where Duncan became sick with the virus, the woman told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Louise, is quarantined with one of her children who is younger than 13 and two nephews in their 20s. The four of them were in the apartment when Duncan became ill, Cooper said. Louise and her family are in isolation with sheets and towels used by the Ebola-stricken Duncan, Cooper said. Louise did use bleach to clean her apartment, ""but it's not clear to me how systematic the cleaning was,"" he said. Authorities are working to find ""more suitable living arrangements"" for the family, Jenkins said. Up to 100 people being contacted . Health officials are reaching out to as many as 100 people who may have had contact with Duncan, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of State Health Services said Thursday. These are people who are still being questioned because they may have crossed paths with the patient either at the hospital, at his apartment complex or in the community. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we're starting with this very wide net, including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient's home,"" spokeswoman Carrie Williams said. ""The number will drop as we focus in on those whose contact may represent a potential risk of infection."" The number of direct contacts who have been identified and are being monitored right now is ""more than 12,"" a federal official told CNN on Thursday. ""By the end of the day, we should have a pretty good idea of how many contacts there are,"" the official said. Being ""monitored"" means a public health worker visits twice a day to take the contact's temperature and ask them if they are experiencing any symptoms. None of the people being monitored has so far shown symptoms. Most are not being quarantined, though Dallas County health officials have ordered four close relatives of the patient to stay home and not have any visitors until at least October 19. ""The family was having some challenges following the directions to stay home, so we're taking every precaution,"" Texas Department of Health spokeswoman Carrie Williams said about why the state had issued a legal order. Two things are still spreading in Dallas: fear and frustration. Some parents are scared to take their kids to the schools that his girlfriend's children attended. Attendance at those schools Thursday was down to about 86% on Thursday, said Mike Miles, superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District. Custodians are stepping up cleanup work at the schools, he said. ""We don't think there's any virus at any of those buildings, but we'll take that off the table, so we're doing extra cleaning and disinfecting,"" Miles said. Others are upset at the hospital where Duncan first sought care, which sent him home and raised the possibility he could infect others for at least two additional days. U.S. President Barack Obama contacted Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings on Thursday to make sure Dallas was getting the federal resources it needs ""to treat the patient safely, and control this case so that it does not spread widely,"" the White House said. Your Ebola questions answered . Should Americans worry about getting Ebola? How Ebola spreads . Hospital: 'Flaw' in electronic records hid travel history . On September 24, four days after he arrived in Dallas from Liberia, Duncan started feeling symptoms. That day is significant because that's when he started being contagious.  Late the following night, he went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas with a low-grade fever and abdominal pain, the hospital said. Duncan told a nurse he had been in Africa. But ""regretfully, that information was not fully communicated throughout the full team,"" said Dr. Mark Lester, executive vice president of Texas Health Resources. Duncan was sent home with painkillers and antibiotics, only to return in worse condition on September 28. That's when he was isolated. ""It was a mistake. They dropped the ball,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the miscommunication at the hospital. ""You don't want to pile on them, but hopefully this will never happen again. ... The CDC has been vigorously emphasizing the need for a travel history."" Why didn't doctors know Duncan had been to Liberia? The hospital said Thursday night that a ""flaw"" in its electronic health records prevented doctors from seeing Duncan's travel history even though he shared it on his first visit to the hospital. Duncan told a nurse he'd been in Africa, but that information was entered into a document that isn't automatically visible to physicians, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas said in a statement Thursday. After discovering this, the hospital says it has changed the system so doctors and nurses will see travel history documentation. ""We feel that this change will improve the early identification of patients who may be at risk for communicable diseases, including Ebola,"" the hospital said. The hospital released a detailed description of what it said was the chain of events when Duncan first came to the hospital on September 25. ""In the interest of transparency, and because we want other U.S. hospitals and providers to learn from our experience, we are, with Mr. Duncan's permission, releasing this information,"" the hospital said. Nurses and doctors at the hospital followed protocols, the hospital said. ""When Mr. Duncan was asked if he had been around anyone who had been ill,"" the statement said, ""he said that he had not.""","""Flaw"" in electronic records hid Thomas Eric Duncan's travel history, hospital says .

"Watch out for bare butts when traveling in Machu Picchu -- incidents of ""naked tourism"" at the 15th-century Inca citadel are on the rise, and getting under the skin of Peru officials. According to the Peruvian Times, four American tourists were detained on March 14 for getting naked and posing for photos at the site. In a pair of separate incidents earlier in the week, two Canadians and two Australians were detained for stripping down for pictures at Machu Picchu. The bare-it-all episodes followed a 2013 incident in which a naked couple was videotaped by other tourists while streaking across Machu Picchu's grass field and bounding down a stone staircase like a pair of adolescent antelopes. The website My Naked Trip features images of an Israeli man named Amichay Rab posing in the buff at sites around South America, including Machu Picchu. Rab's long, curly hair and bold poses have won him a cluster of followers. The photos and video have made the rounds on social media. Peruvian officials are not amused. Crackdown . Peru's Ministry of Culture has denounced the spectacle of nude visitors at Machu Picchu as ""disrespectful"" and ""unfortunate events that threaten cultural heritage."" ""There are places in the world that people can get naked, but not all places are (appropriate) for getting undressed,"" Alfredo Mormontoy Atayupanqui, director of archaeological resources for Peru's Ministry of Culture, tells CNN. According to Mormontoy, park rules printed on the back of admission tickets warn visitors against being nude in public. ""Tourists should comply with local rules and regulations when they are traveling, otherwise there will be thousands of problems,"" he says. Meanwhile, Cusco's regional director of culture, Ricardo Ruiz Caro, has issued a statement saying that park guards at Machu Picchu and other historic sites in the region will increase surveillance and crackdown on naked tourism. New rules announced but yet to be put in place are also meant to address the issue of overcrowding at the site. According to the Peruvian Times, ""All foreign visitors to Machu Picchu will soon have to hire an official guide to enter the Inca Citadel, follow one of three predetermined routes through the complex and face time limits at specific points to keep the traffic flowing, under new rules promulgated by the Ministry of Culture in Cusco."" ""Machu Picchu is visited by tourists of different ages, religions and ideologies,"" says Mormontoy. ""Nude behavior may bring pleasure to a small percentage of people, but it causes discomfort and anger to others. We need to make sure other tourists don't feel awkward.""

"Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a strongman in the troubled Horn of Africa and a key United States ally, has died, his government announced Tuesday. Meles had not been seen in public in months, sparking intense international speculation about his health. The government revealed neither the cause nor the location of his death Monday at the age of 57. Meles came to the forefront as a leader of a guerrilla insurgency against dictator Haile Mengistu Mariam in 1991 and cemented power in the ensuing decades. Seen by admirers as a force for stability in a region with Islamist insurgencies in Somalia and Yemen and a history of famine, he was also criticized for cracking down on political opposition and the press. ""He came to power at the barrel of a gun, but he made the transition from rebel leader to political leader very quickly,"" said Ayo Johnson, a writer on Africa and director of Viewpoint Africa. But he never overcame his ""mindset as a rebel leader,"" and his democratic credentials were ""poor,"" Johnson said. ""The West turned a blind eye to many aspects of his game that were not up to scratch,"" he added. That's partly because of his action against Islamist movements in the region, including an invasion of Somalia in 1998, Johnson said. ""He supported everything that the United States wanted to do against terror,"" he explained, such as give American drones based in the region permission to use Ethiopian airspace on their way to targets in Somalia. And ""he was able to address the fundamentals -- health care, education, reducing the poverty rate,"" Johnson said. U.S. President Barack Obama praised Meles' ""unyielding commitment to Ethiopia's poor"" in a statement Tuesday, citing his ""personal admiration for (Meles') desire to lift millions of Ethiopians out of poverty through his drive for food security."" But in June, U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, highlighted a different aspect of Meles' rule -- the case of journalist Eskinder Nega, who was then before a court in Addis Ababa. While praising the prime minister's work in ""containing the real threat of terrorism in the region and making gains against the region's recurring famines,"" Leahy accused him of ""trying to silence those who do not toe the official line."" His Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front took all but one seat in parliament in elections in 2010, Africa expert Jason Mosley pointed out in the wake of Meles' death. ""Nearly 200 people were reportedly killed, and tens of thousands detained"" in the previous elections in 2005, said Mosley, who is with the Chatham House think tank in London. Last year, Ethiopia found two Swedish journalists guilty of supporting terrorism and sentenced them to 11 years in prison. Meles died at 11:40 p.m. Monday from an unspecified infection, spokesman Bereket Simon said.  Deputy Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn is now in charge. There will be no elections before the next scheduled ballot in 2015, Bereket said. Meles had been scheduled to step down in 2013 as part of a transition process, Mosley said, but questioned whether he genuinely intended to relinquish power. Meles was out of the country when he died and members of his family were with him, according to Bereket. He did not say what country Meles' body was in or when it would return to Ethiopia, except that it would be soon. The spokesman acknowledged the prime minister had been sick for some time but didn't immediately seek treatment. The news came almost a week after the government said Meles was ""recovering well"" after treatment for an unspecified illness. Bloggers launched a counter of the number of days he's been missing, while citizens took to social media to discuss his whereabouts and exchange conspiracy theories. The secretive nation had released little information about his whereabouts, prompting rumors and opposition claims that he was dead or facing a life-threatening illness. The government held a news conference last month and announced Meles received treatment for an unspecified illness. His absence was more evident last month when Ethiopia hosted an African Union summit in its capital of Addis Ababa. Meles, a key player in talks on the tensions between Sudan and its rival neighbor South Sudan, did not attend. Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Ethiopia under Meles had ""played a key role in both the region and the African continent."" ""I hope that his successor will continue to be a driving force on a wide range of issues, from brokering peace negotiations to shaping development relationships,"" Annan said. Ethiopia, a key Western ally often lauded for effective use of aid money, is surrounded by unstable nations such as Somalia and Sudan. Meles has been credited with working toward peace and security in the region, and the Ethiopian army sent peacekeepers to battle the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia.

"The trial of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy on charges of inciting the murders of at least three protesters in 2012 has been postponed until February 1 because he did not appear in court Wednesday. Morsy is charged alongside 14 other members of the Muslim Brotherhood. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. The second session in their trial was due to take place Wednesday, after a chaotic opening hearing in November. But according to a letter read by the judge in court, the helicopter that was transporting Morsy from prison could not take off due to poor weather conditions -- despite earlier reports in state media that the ousted President had arrived in court. One of Morsy's co-defendants, former Parliamentarian Essam el-Erian, told reporters from the stand before the session that the trial was a ""political vendetta."" El-Erian, the vice chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, was arrested in October. He said Morsy is still the legitimate elected President and is still not being allowed to meet with lawyers or family. ""Our stance is still the same. This is an unjust trial. This is an unconstitutional trial,"" el-Erian said. The judge made the public prosecution responsible for bringing Morsy to the hearing on February 1. Lawyer Ramy Ghanem told CNN it's up to the judge to decide whether or not to proceed with a hearing if a defendant already in custody is not present. Morsy has yet to accept legal representation, so he had no lawyer to represent him in court Wednesday. A lawyer appointed by the Freedom and Justice Party to represent him did not show up. Egypt's interim Cabinet officially labels Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group . Morsy supporters, security forces clash . A number of Morsy supporters gathered Wednesday morning outside the police academy where the trial session was to be held. Some were arrested because of skirmishes with police, according to Nile TV. Hundreds of protesters also staged a pro-Morsy demonstration after prayers at al-Salam mosque in Cairo's eastern Nasr City area. According to state media and the Muslim Brotherhood's website, they clashed with security forces that fired tear gas. According to the state-run newspaper Al-Ahram, the protesters had planned to march to the nearby police academy. Meanwhile, roads leading to Cairo's Tahrir Square, the scene of many mass public protests, were closed after calls from pro-Morsy forces to march in support of the ousted President during the trial. Morsy, who was deposed by the military amid widespread protest of his rule, has been in detention since early July. The charges stem from December 2012 protests over a constitution that Morsy shepherded into effect. Egyptian authorities have accused the former President and his staff of ordering supporters to attack protesters outside the presidential palace after guards and members of the Interior Ministry refused to do it. Morsy has said he doesn't recognize the court's authority, claiming he still is Egypt's legitimate President. Muslim Brotherhood members have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization. Egypt is due to hold a referendum on January 14 and 15 on a new constitution that would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military.","The second session in the trial of Mohamed Morsy is postponed until February .

"The national controversy over a surge of Central American immigrants illegally crossing the U.S. border established a new battleground this week in a Southern California small town where angry crowds thwarted detained migrants from entering their community. In a faceoff Tuesday with three buses carrying the migrants behind screened-off windows, the demonstrators chanted ""Go back home!"" and ""USA"" and successfully forced the coaches to leave Murrieta, CNN affiliate KFMB reported. The buses instead took the 140 or so undocumented immigrants to U.S. processing centers at least 80 miles away, in the San Diego and El Centro areas, federal officials say. Counter-protesters squared off with the demonstrators, and a shouting match erupted over the nation's immigration system, which recently has been overwhelmed with a tide of Central American minors illegally entering the United States alone or with other children. A mix of poverty, violence and smugglers' false promises is prompting the Central American inflow. Unlike undocumented Mexican migrants, who are often immediately deported, the U.S. government detains and processes the Central Americans, who are eventually released and given a month to report to immigration offices. Many never show up and join the nation's 11 million undocumented population, says the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents. The Latin American immigrants rejected by Murrieta protesters were initially held in Texas, where U.S. facilities are so overflowing that detainees are sent to other states for processing. The government doesn't have the room to shelter the children with adults: there's only one family immigration detention center, in Pennsylvania. To assist the unaccompanied children, President Barack Obama's administration opened shelters last month on three military bases because federal facilities more designed for adults were overrun with minors. Tuesday's busloads of detained Central American immigrants didn't include any unaccompanied minors, said Murrieta Police Chief Sean Hadden, who put the number of protesters at 125. The children on the buses were apparently in the company of relatives or other adults, said an official with the National Border Patrol Council. 'Deport! Deport!' The protesters, who shouted ""Impeach Obama!"" and ""Deport! Deport!"" confronted the buses a day after the town posted a notice on its website: ""Murrieta Opposes Illegal Immigrant Arrival."" ""This is a failure to enforce federal law at the federal level,"" Mayor Alan Long said in a statement Monday about the pending arrival of the 140 immigrants to the U.S. Border Patrol station. ""Murrieta continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local border patrol office."" Long spoke to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" later Wednesday. ""It's not against the immigrants,"" he said. ""They're trying to leave a less desirable place and come to the greatest nation in the world. We can't blame them for that ... No one's protesting that. What we're protesting is the product of a broken system that finally reached the doorstep of our community."" Long said that neither side in the national debate is coming up with a solution: ""The problem still is there. The problem is in Washington, D.C."" The local controversy was to continue with a town hall meeting scheduled for 6:30 p.m PT Wednesday. The U.S. government is scheduled to send another group of undocumented immigrants to Murrieta for processing on Friday, the union official for Border Patrol agents said. Chief Hadden also said he was told to expect 140 immigrants every 72 hours, with the next group scheduled to arrive on Friday, the Fourth of July. Earlier Wednesday, immigration rights advocates denounced the protesters. ""It is deplorable that people espousing anti-immigrant hate language created unnecessary tension and fear for immigrant mothers and their children,"" Pedro Rios, a community representative of the San Diego Immigrant Rights Consortium, said in a statement. ""Even more concerning is that elected officials in the City of Murrieta instigated this tension. Mothers and their children on these buses have suffered through enough trauma."" At a Murrieta City Council meeting Tuesday night, Long seemed more conciliatory than his statement posted a day earlier on the city's website. Long thanked police and others. ""Please remember these are human beings that are fleeing the violence in their home countries,"" Long said. ""The problem is that they need to come into this country the legal way."" Journey from Texas . The U.S. government earlier flew the 140 Central American immigrants from south Texas to San Diego. Federal agents were busing them to Murrieta for processing at the Border Patrol station when the standoff took place Tuesday, CNN affiliates reported. After the buses turned around, the 140 immigrants were taken to the U.S. Border Patrol's San Ysidro station in San Diego, said Ron Zermeno of the National Border Patrol Council . On Wednesday, Zermeno told CNN that at least 136 immigrants were fed and screened. Among the group, 10 children were taken to local hospitals, though it's unclear why, Zermeno said. Seven more children were diagnosed with active scabies, an itchy and highly contagious skin disease. Those children are being kept separate from the others at the San Ysidro station, he said. Seventeen of the immigrants were taken to the Boulevard station in eastern San Diego County, Zermeno said. The U.S. government is struggling to detain and accommodate an influx of undocumented immigrants, particularly a wave of unaccompanied children from the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The U.S. government doesn't have enough beds, food or sanitary facilities. Authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House has called an ""immediate humanitarian crisis."" To help relieve crowded facilities in Texas, undocumented immigrants are now being sent elsewhere to be processed. But Zermeno contended that processing immigrants, rather than enforcing the borders, is only making the situation worse. ""My concern is they are going to be eating in the same holding cells as someone sitting five feet away using the bathroom,"" he said. Intense debate . The furor in Murrieta illustrated the conflict between protecting the borders and ensuring the safety of detained immigrants and children. Protester Ellen Meeks said the country's identity has eroded with an influx of undocumented immigrants. ""I just wish America would be America again because it's not, and it's not just pointed to the Hispanics,"" Meeks said. ""Everybody needs to go through the legal ways."" Other protesters told CNN affiliate KGTV said they wanted immigrants to follow the legal process to enter the United States. ""Everybody that wants to come to this nation is entitled to, but they should come the right way,"" Bob Cuccio told the news outlet. ""You bring in all these children and they're going to take over our schools,"" Bel Reeves added. ""What's going to happen to the kids that were born and raised here?"" But immigration rights advocate Enrique Morones likened the migration to a refugee crisis and suggested racial antipathy was motivating protesters. ""If these children were from Canada, we would not be having this interview,"" Morones said. ""The parents have had enough. They are saying, 'If I don't send my child north, they are going to die.'"" Last month, the Obama administration unveiled a plan to spend almost $100 million in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help reintegrate the undocumented migrants whom the United States will deport, and to help keep them in their home countries. The administration also will set aside $161.5 million this year for the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) programs in an effort to ""help stem migration flows as well as address the root cause of the migration,"" the White House said. The Obama administration has accused syndicates in Latin America of waging a deliberate campaign of misinformation about relocating to the United States that has caused people in poor Central American countries and Mexico to risk their lives to cross the U.S. border illegally.

"If you're serving burgers and Bud Light at your backyard wedding, don't worry. You and your spouse may have the last laugh. A new study found that couples who spend less on their wedding tend to have longer-lasting marriages than those who splurge. The study, by two economics professors at Emory University, found a similar correlation between less-expensive engagement rings and lower divorce rates. The study's authors didn't examine why, although they floated a few theories. ""It could be that the type of couples who have a ... (cheap wedding) are the type that are a perfect match for each other,"" said Professor Hugo M. Mialon, who co-authored the study with Andrew M. Francis. ""Or it could be that having an inexpensive wedding relieves young couples of financial burdens that may strain their marriage,"" he said. The research was based on a detailed survey completed by 3,151 adults in the United States who are, or have been, married. The authors believe theirs is the first academic study to examine the correlation between wedding expenses and the length of marriages. Specifically, the study found that women whose wedding cost more than $20,000 divorced at a rate roughly 1.6 times higher than women whose wedding cost between $5,000 and $10,000. And couples who spent $1,000 or less on their big day had a lower than average rate of divorce. The study won't be cheered by the booming wedding industry, which encourages couples to spend freely on everything from invitations and flowers to videographers and Champagne. Couples in the United States spent an average of $29,858 for their big day in 2013 -- a record high -- according to a survey of 13,000 brides and grooms by wedding website TheKnot.com. ""The wedding industry has long associated lavish weddings with longer-lasting marriages. Industry advertising has fueled norms that create the impression that spending large amounts on the wedding is a signal of commitment or is necessary for a marriage to be successful,"" Francis told CNN in an e-mail. ""Overall, our findings provide little evidence to support the validity of the wedding industry's general message that connects expensive weddings with positive marital outcomes,"" he said. Planning a wedding? In addition to slashing costs, you might want to invite those extra co-workers and far-flung cousins, too. The Emory study also found that the greater the number of people who attend a wedding, the lower the rate of divorce. ""This could be evidence of a community effect, i.e., having more support from friends and family may help the couple to get through the challenges of marriage,"" Francis said. ""Or this could be that the type of couples who have a lot of friends and family are also the type that tend not to divorce as much.""","Study: Couples who spend less on their wedding have longer-lasting marriages .

"Le Bourget, France (CNN) -- Once upon a time, the airship was hailed as the future of flight: as glamorous, luxurious and fashionable as the Art Deco era which marked its heyday. But a series of disasters, not least the crash of the Hindenburg in New Jersey, in 1937, with the loss of 36 lives, put paid to the dreams of intercontinental Zeppelin travel. Blimps are still a familiar sight in advertising, but those who design and build these aircraft believe there's much more to them -- and to their future -- than simply signposting the local car dealership or giving TV audiences a better view of the football field during the big match. Now, 90 years after the launch of America's first airship, the USS Shenandoah, dirigibles and aerostats are undergoing something of a renaissance. Among those hoping to lead the charge is California-based Aeros, which is developing what it hopes will be a revolutionary new cargo airship, the Aeroscraft, combining elements of regular 'lighter-than-air' (LTA) craft and traditional fixed-wing planes. In addition, it has a magic ingredient: the vertical take-off and landing capabilities of a helicopter, meaning it has no need for a runway or airfield. Read more: Test your aviation knowledge . The idea was developed by Kazakhstan-born engineer Igor Pasternak, who moved to the U.S. in 1994 and set up in business building advertising blimps. He's spent the past two decades working to solve the problems posed by traditional airships. ""I understand airships well,"" he told CNN. ""I've built a lot of them."" His Aeroscraft is a rigid-hulled dirigible measuring a whopping 169 meters in length, with a payload of 66 tonnes (and plans for a 250 tonne version), a cruising speed of up to 120 knots, and a range of 3,100 nautical miles. ""It's a little bit like my dream vehicle,"" he said. ""In natural disasters and other situations where infrastructure is non-existent, the Aeroscraft could be used to bring in emergency supplies: food, water, blankets -- 66 tonnes of relief at a time,"" explained the company's communications director John Kiehle. And while its primary purpose is likely to be logistical, moving cargo, military troops and humanitarian relief supplies into remote and inhospitable terrain, the company admits that down the line there may be other uses for the technology, from ""floating hotels"" to ""sky yachts for millionaires."" Read more: 50 years of Paris Airshow . So far, the company has created a scaled-down version of the aircraft to prove that the design can work; the next step is a full-size prototype. The aim is to have the first Aeroscraft flying by 2016, and the initial fleet of 24 vehicles up and running by 2020 to 2021. ""This truly is a game-changer,"" said Bill Feeley, the company's director of strategic finances. ""It's a real shift in industrial technology, on a par with the building of skyscrapers, or the creation of nuclear energy."" Pasternak and Kiehle say one of the Aeroscraft's biggest advantages is that it runs on regular diesel, rather than expensive aviation fuel which can be tough to get hold of in the world's more inaccessible regions. But another airship project currently in research and development could end up being even cheaper and easier to power: innovation and engineering consultancy group Altran's Sun Cloud is a dirigible powered by solar energy. It's an area the company has some experience in, having already worked on Solar Impulse, the world's first plane powered solely by the sun. Like Aeros' airship, the Sun Cloud is designed to carry large loads of cargo over long distances -- but the Sun Cloud is missing one component likely to be key to the Aeroscraft's success: the pilot. Altran's feasibility study is examining whether it is possible to move payloads of up to 250 tonnes from place to place in what is effectively a super-sized drone. Read more: On your marks, jet set, go! ""We're not looking to replace traditional forms of cargo transportation,"" explained the program's manager, Ali Jafaar. ""Container ships can carry 500,000 tonnes at a time -- we're not looking to do that."" Instead the idea is to be able to move large items, such as plane parts, long distances from one factory to another. Reliance on solar power means the aircraft would be far slower than a regular plane, traveling at just 25km an hour, but the fact it is is unmanned means it could potentially remain airborne, at high altitudes, for lengthy periods of time. ""It's all about speed, and optimizing energy,"" said Jafaar. ""What uses up energy is going fast. Humans always want to be going faster but we're not going to be carrying humans, so the slower speeds can be tolerated."" If and when the Sun Cloud gets off the ground -- which Jafaar admits is not likely to happen for some years yet -- it may well find it isn't the only airship hovering around above us. U.S. defense contractor Raytheon is already planning to put its own aerostats (airships which are tethered to the ground) into the skies above the U.S. capital, Washington. Read more: Paris airshow's incredible moments . But instead of carrying troops or manufacturing supplies, Raytheon's blimps will be loaded with surveillance equipment, to watch for the threat of attacks. The catchily-titled Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor, or JLENS for short, is designed to scan the skies, the seas and the streets below for signs of danger, be it from incoming missiles and drones, or suspicious boats or trucks. ""An airplane can only stay up for so long, but JLENS is persistent,"" said Raytheon's Keith McNamara. ""Because it's tethered, with its power source on the ground, it can stay up there 24/7 for 30 days at a time. ""And because it's so much higher up than radar on the ground, it can see much further, hundreds of kilometres, as opposed to tens of kilometres."" While Raytheon's blimps will be equipped with all the latest technology, the idea itself is nothing new: hydrogen-filled balloons were used for surveillance during the American Civil War. It seems that some 260 years after the Montgolfier brothers first ascended into the skies above Paris in a hot air balloon, the glory days of the dirigible may be yet to come.","U.S. company Aeros developing massive airship to carry heavy cargo long distances .

"Deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy on Sunday taunted court officials who placed him in a soundproof glass box during his trial on conspiracy charges, a proceeding cut short by his lawyers' objections. ""If this farce continues, leave the trial,"" Morsy told his lawyers through a microphone. ""Those who are afraid of my appearance before the people have no public support,"" he added. Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, was toppled in a military coup in July and faces trial on a variety of charges -- the most recent being allegations that he spied for an unnamed foreign power. Sunday's session marked the second time he was placed in a glass enclosure. When he was hauled into court along with nearly three dozen co-defendants, his lawyers complained the soundproof enclosure hindered their ability to communicate with their client. ""The glass dock is to humiliate the defendants,"" said Mohamed Selim El-Awa, his lead attorney. ""This is unprecedented in the world."" El-Awa told CNN that the defendants can't hear inside the glass-enclosed dock and that presiding Judge Shaaban el-Shamy isn't the only one controlling the sound. The judge refused requests to discuss this issue in private, making it impossible for the lawyers to do their job, he said. And Ahmed Morsy, the ex-leader's son, said, ""This is what the coup authorities want."" With defense lawyers refusing to participate, proceedings were adjourned until February 23. The judge threatened to appoint new lawyers, and the defense attorneys appeared divided over whether they should return. El-Awa said the withdrawal would remain in effect until the glass barrier is removed. ""What is important is that I haven't gone against my conscience,"" El-Awa said. But defense spokesman Mohamed El Damaty said that given the court's threat to appoint new attorneys, Morsy's lawyers may have to submit to the ""bitter reality"" and continue their defense in later sessions. The trial is one of several that Morsy is facing amid Egypt's seesaw power struggles. The latest charges against him include spying for foreign organizations outside Egypt, committing terrorist acts inside the country, disclosing classified defense information to a foreign country and funding terrorism. He already has been charged with inciting the killings of political opponents and organizing a 2011 jailbreak by members of his then-banned Muslim Brotherhood. Morsy, the former head of the Brotherhood's political arm, won office in 2012. Shortly after he was elected, he resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party in an effort to show he would represent all Egyptians. But he was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule, with opponents accusing him of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of counts, including organizing attacks on Egyptian troops in the Sinai Peninsula and fueling ""sectarian sedition with the aim of igniting civil war in Egypt."" The Brotherhood had long been suppressed during the 29-year rule of former strongman Hosni Mubarak. But it became the most powerful political force in Egypt after the popular revolt that toppled Mubarak in 2011. Supporters say the military-backed government that replaced Morsy has returned to the authoritarian practices of Mubarak.","Those who fear his appearance ""have no public support,"" Morsy declares .

"In a dramatic shift toward a major Arab ally, the Obama administration announced a suspension of significant military aid to Egypt on Wednesday over the bloody crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood. The move, involving hundreds of millions in U.S. assistance to the Egyptian military, is the culmination of months of debate within the administration about how to respond to the July 3 ouster of former President Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected leader. ""As a result of the review directed by President Obama, we have decided to maintain our relationship with the Egyptian government, while recalibrating our assistance to Egypt to best advance our interests,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. The Obama administration has still not labeled Morsy's removal from office a coup. Such a designation would require a cut in all but humanitarian aid, a step Obama has been reluctant to take. Last month, the president's top national security advisers recommended he cut most of the aid to the military. Officials have said Washington wants to maintain its relationship with the Egyptian military and interim government, and the statement noted the United States and Egypt still ""have a ""longstanding partnership and many shared interests."" But after U.S. calls for Egyptian military restraint over the past few months were met with a crackdown on Morsy supporters, Obama canceled a joint military exercise and announced the review of all American aid to Egypt. Death toll rises as violence rages on in Egypt . Some military aid was suspended and military shipments from the United States were slowed while the review was underway. The United States will ""continue to hold the delivery of certain large-scale military systems and cash assistance to the government pending credible progress toward an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government through free and fair elections,"" Psaki said in the statement. ""The United States continues to support a democratic transition and oppose violence as a means of resolving differences within Egypt,"" she added. Senior administration officials briefed reporters on details of the decision. The United States will halt a $260 million cash transfer to Egypt and suspend large-scale military systems, like the F-16 aircraft, M1A1 tank parts, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and Apache helicopters. Some of the aid will be ""repurposed"" to benefit the Egyptian people. One of the officials said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called Egyptian army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to advise him of the decision. Hagel told him the United States would continue military training and education, a symbol of the long-term relationship. The aid cut is meant to be temporary with the hope that the Egyptian military will take steps toward restoring democracy. The United States also plans to meet its commitments for Egypt-related work being performed by contractors. Non-military assistance for programs like health, education and private sector economic development programs will also continue, Psaki said, adding that the United States would put a premium on assistance going forward that ""directly benefits the Egyptian people."" ""The United States wants to see Egypt succeed, and we believe the U.S.-Egypt partnership will be strongest when Egypt is represented by an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government based on the rule of law, fundamental freedoms and an open and competitive economy,"" she said. The move does not include funding toward security in the Sinai Peninsula and along the Egyptian border with Gaza, as well as assistance for counter-terrorism, Psaki said. In September, an Egyptian court banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, drawing complaints from the international community. At the United Nations General Assembly, Egypt's interim foreign minister sought to quell these concerns. Nabil Fahmy said Egypt will hold elections in the spring. He also argued that the political process is open to all ""as long as they are committed to the renunciation of violence and terrorism and acts of incitement to them."" But violence has continued throughout the country. Dozens of people were killed last weekend when Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with their opponents and security forces. The statement issued on Wednesday suggested the move could be reversed if the govern0ment took steps to restore democracy. ""We will continue to review the decisions regarding our assistance periodically and will continue to work with the interim government to help it move toward our shared goals in an atmosphere free of violence and intimidation,"" Psaki said. On Tuesday, Amnesty International sent a letter to Obama urging the United States to not facilitate arms for Egypt. ""The U.S. government needs to stop providing arms or allowing back door sales of weapons or equipment that Egypt's security forces will likely use to violate human rights,"" Frank Jannuzi, the group's deputy executive director, said. ""Before sales resume, Egyptian authorities must investigate and prosecute those responsible for recent incidents of excessive force. Otherwise, the Obama administration will be giving a 'get out of jail free' card to those who have violently suppressed peaceful protestors,"" he said. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman said in the short-term, the U.S. decision could have a positive impact in Egypt. ""Immediately, probably, the Egyptian government is going to find it's going to gain somewhat in terms of local public opinion,"" Wedeman said. ""Egyptians I've already been in touch with about this decision or announcement from the United States that it's going to cut aid seem to react positively. There seems to be a lot of frustration with the United States, given its role in Egypt over the last two-and-a-half years since the revolution."" But don't expect to see Egypt's military hurting financially, Wedeman said. ""For the Egyptian government, a cutoff in U.S. aid is symbolically significant, but in terms of the actual amount of money they're getting, it will not make a big difference,"" he said. Wedeman said Gulf states have been pouring billions into Egypt since Morsy's ouster. A move to cut off aid would likely anger those allies who have urged the United States to support the military and warned against stopping assistance. Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who chairs the appropriations panel that funds U.S. assistance to Egypt, said federal law ""is clear"" and requires that aid be severed in the event of a coup. ""Rather than encourage reconciliation and restore democracy as it promised, the Egyptian military has reinstituted martial law and cracked down on the Islamic opposition, which has also used violence,"" he said in a statement. ""The administration is trying to have it both ways, by suspending some aid but continuing other aid. By doing that, the message is muddled.  If they want to continue aid to the Egyptian government they should ask Congress for a waiver.""","Obama administration decision is a dramatic shift toward a major Arab ally .

"A federal judge on Friday ruled that Michigan's prohibition on same-sex marriage violates the U.S. Constitution, ordering the state to stop enforcing the ban. ""Today's decision ... affirms the enduring principle that regardless of whoever finds favor in the eyes of the most recent majority, the guarantee of equal protection must prevail,"" U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman wrote. Michigan is the latest state in which federal judges have struck down state constitutional bans on gay marriage. Similar rulings recently have been issued in Texas, Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Utah, though in those cases judges have put off enforcement of the decisions until higher courts can weigh in. Friday's decision is different in that it opens the door for same-sex couples to get marriage licenses in Michigan very soon. Barb Byrum, the elected county clerk for Ingham County and a Democrat, said she is eager and ready to do so once her office opens at 8 a.m. Monday. ""This is a wonderful decision,"" Byrum said. ""Many Michiganders have been waiting for equality in our great state, and I look forward to the opportunity to issue marriage licenses to all loving couples."" That day may not come so fast. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican whose term expires later this year, announced Friday evening he's filed an emergency request for Friedman's order to be stayed and appealed. ""In 2004, the citizens of Michigan recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable,"" Schuette said. ""Michigan voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution, and their will should stand and be respected."" He was referring to the year that voters in Michigan, along with those in 10 other states, passed state constitutional amendments restricting ""marriage or (a) similar union"" to between one man and one woman. Whether same-sex couples should be allowed to wed was a hot-button issue then and in subsequent years, with polls showing that most Americans favored restrictions. But public opinion shifted over time. An ABC News/Washington Post survey released earlier this month found that 59% of Americans favor allowing gay or lesbian couples to legally wed. Michigan's amendment, specifically, states the rationale for its restrictions is ""to secure and preserve the benefits of marriage for our society and for future generations of children."" Friedman -- like federal judges in other recent, similar cases -- ruled Michigan's ban violates the Equal Protection Clause  in the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment. He said, ""The court finds the (Michigan Marriage Amendment) impermissibly discriminates against same-sex couples in violation of the Equal Protection Clause because the provision does not advance any conceivable state interest."" The plaintiffs in the Michigan case, April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, sued in part because Michigan law also ""restricts adoptions to either single persons or married couples."" They had hoped to jointly adopt three children under their care. Friday's ruling, then, would seem to open the door to same-sex couples jointly adopting children, since now they could be legally married. In the ruling, Friedman cited  the Supreme Court's landmark decisions last June rejecting parts of the Defense of Marriage Act while ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. The justices didn't go as far as saying that all states must allow such marriages to take place within their borders, but a number of lower federal courts did subsequently step into the fray. In addition to United States v. Windsor, Friedman also pointed to Loving v. Virginia -- in which the Supreme Court ruled that Virginia's ban on interracial marriages was unconstitutional. ""Both the Windsor and Loving decisions stand for the proposition that, without some overriding legitimate interest, the state cannot use its domestic relations authority to legislate families out of existence,"" the judge wrote. Keeping their own family together is and was DeBoer and Rowse's No. 1 goal, they said. ""Jayne and I do want to get married, but this case is about the protection of our children,"" a joyful DeBoer said. ""It is not about individuals, it is not about her or my relationship. It is about ensuring that our children will remain together no matter what happens to her and I.""","Winning plaintiff says, ""This case is about the protection of our children""

"Thomas Perez has climbed America's ""ladder of opportunity"" and now can help others do the same, President Barack Obama said on Monday in nominating the assistant U.S. attorney general as labor secretary. The son of Dominican immigrants who worked different jobs such as collecting garbage to help pay for college, Perez has dedicated himself to fulfilling the promise of equal opportunity for all, Obama told a White House ceremony to introduce Perez, 51. CNN's Jessica Yellin reported earlier this month that Obama would name Perez to the Cabinet position. If confirmed by the Senate, the lone Hispanic Cabinet selection of Obama's second term so far would succeed Hilda Solis, who resigned in January. In brief remarks, Perez thanked Obama in both English and Spanish for what he called the honor of the opportunity. He pledged to work with ""our partners"" in organized labor, the business community, grassroots organizations and Congress, adding that he looked forward to meeting with senators from both parties to discuss the way forward. ""True progress is possible if you keep and open mind, listen to all sides and focus on results,"" Perez said. Obama urged that Perez be confirmed ""as quickly as possible."" Perez's nomination comes as the economy continues a sluggish recovery from recession, with unemployment hovering near 8%. The Labor Department, among other things, oversees analysis and reporting of unemployment statistics as well as occupational safety and other wage and employment issues. While some indicators show improvement, economists warn some fragility remains and political leaders are divided on policy prescriptions for stronger growth. Obama and Democrats call for a combination of stimulus spending, budget cuts and reforms to the tax system and entitlement programs to reduce chronic federal deficits and debt while maintaining government support for education, research and other areas they consider vital to economic development. Republicans seeking to shrink government say that reducing its cost is the fastest and best way to prompt growth by reducing regulations and lowering taxes. They call for spending cuts and entitlement reforms, as well as changes to the tax system that would reduce rates without increasing revenue. In nominating Perez, Obama called on him to continue efforts by Solis and her team on helping returning war veterans get jobs, improving worker safety in coal mines and other steps to strengthen workers' rights. ""Like so many Americans, Tom knows what it is like to climb the ladder of opportunity,"" Obama said, adding that Perez made protecting the promise of equal opportunity for all ""a cause of his life."" The Labor Department would likely play a role in new employment programs under any comprehensive immigration reform. Perez's nomination pleased unions and workers' rights groups, but rankled Senate conservatives due in part to his record at the Justice Department. ""This is an unfortunate and needlessly divisive nomination. The top priority of the secretary of labor should be to create jobs and higher wages for American workers. But Mr. Perez has aggressively sought ways to allow the hiring of more illegal workers,""  said Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican and a senior member of the Judiciary Committee. ""Mr. Perez has also had a controversial tenure at the Department of Justice where he has demonstrated a fundamentally political approach to the law."" Perez, who has overseen the agency's civil rights division, has been active in several high-profile cases in recent years. In 2010, he launched a probe into the law enforcement tactics of Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio after the lawman's hard line anti-immigration policies led to accusations of civil rights violations. The Justice Department determined that Arpaio had engaged in ""pattern or practice of wide-ranging discrimination against Latinos and retaliatory actions against individuals who criticized"" his department's activities. Arpaio condemned the investigation as politically motivated and a ""witch hunt"" provoked by the Obama administration's disfavor of the state's controversial immigration law. Perez also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from Republican legislators and became the target of a Justice Department inspector general's report. The watchdog concluded that that DOJ's voting rights section lacked professionalism and pointed out pervasive warring between employees who disagreed politically. The case stemmed from a complaint against members of the New Black Panther Party who stood outside a polling station in Philadelphia on Election Day dressed in boots and berets and carrying a nightstick. Civil charges for attempted voter intimidation were sought by the Bush administration, but later dropped against three of four defendants after Obama took office. Republicans accused the DOJ's political leadership of interfering in the decision. Though Perez had not yet been confirmed to oversee the civil rights division when the decision was made, he said in testimony to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in May 2010 that politics played no part in the decision. Horowitz was not satisfied with Perez's account of the situation, saying in his report that Perez should have tried to get more information before testifying. Perez was not accused of any wrongdoing, but he has been criticized for not doing enough to improve what the inspector general described as a dysfunctional department. Before rising to the Justice Department position, Perez led Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. That office is charged with ""safeguarding workers, protecting consumers, providing a safety net and cultivating a thriving workforce,"" according to its website. He also spent 12 years as an attorney in the Justice Department's civil rights division, rising to become deputy assistant attorney general in the 1990s. Perez also worked for the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and spent the final two years of the Clinton administration as head of the Health and Human Services Department's civil rights office.","Perez thanks President Obama in both English and Spanish .

"(CNN) -- Thank you Kim Kardashian. Because of the reality star and her naked backside, we heard the phrase ""break the Internet"" more than we would have imagined in 2014. Of course, no one thing actually ""broke"" it, but here are 10 of the memes and hashtags that tried: . 1. Kim Kardashian's Paper magazine cover . Of course we have to start with this one, but what is really left to say? She did her booty duty by posing nude and oiled on the cover. What followed was an embarrassment of meme riches, with the ""peach emoji booty"" being one of the most innocent. 2. The Solange/Jay Z/Beyonce elevator incident . It was the fight watched 'round the world. Video of superstar rapper Jay Z being pummeled by his sister-in-law, singer and fashionista Solange Knowles in an elevator gave birth to sooooo many memes. Some were funny, some were rude, but all were creative. 3. It's none of Kermit's business . Kermit loves his tea. This meme was all about the world's most famous Muppet offering snarky social commentary while sipping his beverage and ending with the line ""But that's none of my business."" 4. #YesAllWomen . This social media campaign got started in response to postings by Elliot Rodger, who went on killing spree in Isla Vista, California, in May. His anger toward women sparked the hashtag women used to share their stories and thoughts on violence and misogyny. 5. Ice Bucket Challenge . The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge very quickly raised more than $100 million and awareness about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often referred to as ""Lou Gehrig's disease."" Hundreds of celebs and thousands of nonfamous folks posted videos of themselves being doused for the cause. According to Google, there were more than 90 million searches for the term in August. #IceBucketChallenge was everywhere from Twitter to Instagram and Facebook. 6. #AlexfromTarget . Alex Lee was just your typical 16-year-old working a part-time job at Target when a picture of him went viral after it was tweeted thanks to his handsome visage. Quicker than you could say ""Internet sensation,"" the kid was everywhere. Based on a New York Times profile, he seems to have taken it all in stride. 7. #BlackLivesMatter . The hashtag has exploded since the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin and the more recent deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner after encounters with police officers. It's helped lead the online discussion of race relations in America. 8. Things Tim Howard could save . Howard performed magnificently during the USA-Belgium World Cup match and his goalie skills inspired memes listing other things he could save. The U.S. team may not have won the World Cup, but Howard definitely won the internet. 9. Nude celeb hack . Months before the now famous Sony hack, celebrities such as actress Jennifer Lawrence and model Kate Upton had to deal with their iCloud accounts being compromised and personal photos disseminated. The FBI quickly got on the case, but not before the world had seen way more of some stars than they ever anticipated. Many of the memes aren't suitable for work, but they are out there for you to peruse after you clock out. 10. #WeCanLandOnACometButWeCant . After a mechanical space traveler called the Philae probe landed on a comet in November, the Internet started theorizing about other things that are surely easier to accomplish than a comet landing but aren't happening. The jokes were endless but, seriously, why can't you order breakfast at McDonald's after 10:30 a.m.? So many of the suggestions made total sense and we co-signed many of them, except ""#WeCanLandOnACometButWeCant UnCat the Internet.""

"Human rights lawyers filed a class action law suit in a U.S federal court accusing the United Nations of gross negligence and misconduct on behalf of victims of a cholera outbreak in Haiti in 2010. ""The claims are that the U.N. engaged in reckless and gross negligence and misconduct bringing cholera to Haiti,"" said Ira Kurzban, a lawyer and board member with the Boston-based Institute for Justice and Development in Haiti. The group is demanding financial compensation for the 8,300 Haitians who died as a result of the cholera epidemic as well as some 650,000 more survivors of the illness. How women are lifting up Haiti . U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq expressed to CNN ""it is not the United Nations' practice to discuss in public claims filed against the Organization."" Earlier this year, however, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared the United Nations could not receive claims for compensation from Haitian cholera victims, arguing that the organization had legal immunity according to an international convention. In October 2010, a cholera epidemic exploded in Haiti, striking as the island country was still reeling from a deadly earthquake earlier that year which killed tens of thousands of people. The cholera bacteria, which is not indigenous to Haiti, spread rapidly, ultimately killing an estimated 8,300 people. The epidemic sparked riots in several cities and towns against the force of some 8,000 U.N. peacekeepers deployed there. Haiti transitions from relief to rebuilding . Several scientific and medical investigators eventually concluded that one of the likely sources of the outbreak was sewage leaking from a U.N. base housing Nepalese peacekeepers. The base was perched above a tributary stream leading into the Artibonite River near the town of Meille. ""The way we understand disease transmission today, there is no other good explanation for how a (cholera) strain that was present only in the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent traveled 9,000 miles to Haiti and happened to end up in a river next to a base with U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal, said Jonathan Katz, a former Associated Press reporter who was one of the first journalists to investigate the source of outbreak in 2010. Katz, who further investigated the U.N.'s response to the outbreak in his book ""The Big Truck That Went By: How the World Came to Save Haiti and Left Behind a Disaster,"" accused the United Nations of covering up its responsibility for the cholera epidemic. ""In 2010, the U.N. didn't want anyone to talk about this,"" Katz said, in a phone interview with CNN. ""They were directly castigating anyone who would bring up the topic."" In September, the prime minister of Haiti raised the issue during a speech before the U.N. General Assembly. ""The United Nations has a moral responsibility for the eruption of the epidemic,"" said Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe, according to a U.N. transcript. Lamothe argued that the current efforts made by the U.N. to eradicate cholera were far from sufficient. He called for the creation of a joint commission to further study the disease. In a briefing to journalists on Wednesday, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said as a result of the Haitian epidemic, the organization was in the process of adopting steps to prevent the further spread of the disease. ""Part of our lessons learned from this has been to screen peacekeepers for cholera,"" Haq said. Health authorities continue to document thousands of cholera cases a month. At least 182 Haitians died of cholera between April and August 2013, according to the World Health Organization.

"The Washington Redskins find themselves under (deserved) fire for their name, which many Native Americans and others find to be a racial slur.   Previously the target of protests and opprobrium, the Redskins have now lost their federal trademark registration for the name, as it was deemed too disparaging to remain protected.  There are two issue to consider here: one is technical and the other is one we should all find troubling. The first: This case was about a trademark, and the primary purpose of trademark law is to protect the public so that the public can accurately know the source or origin of goods and services. But headlines that say the Redskins lost their trademark are inaccurate. All they lost was their trademark registration, not the right to use the racist term to identify their team -- and that is a key point.  In the United States, trademark rights flow from an organization using the trademark; technically, you don't need to register a trademark in order to have trademark rights.  (In other countries, you need a registration). With its common law rights intact, the team is free to continue to call itself the ""Redskins.""  Moreover, it can still sue you for selling counterfeit Washington Redskins gear, and it can still block someone from starting a Washington Redskins dodgeball team.   The Washington Redskins still have trademark rights, and strong rights at that. If the team owners still have rights in the trademark, why is losing the registration a big deal?  What does a registration give you? It gives you a few statutory presumptions in the event that you go to court over enforcement of your trademark. It gives a presumption of ownership and validity. In simple terms, the cancellation only means that if there is a trademark infringement lawsuit, the Washington Redskins team is going to have to pay a bit more in attorneys' fees to win its case. Opinion: Is end near for Redskins? It's about time . But nobody can seriously argue that Dan Snyder's football team is not the owner of the still-intact trademark rights, nor that the public associates his team with the racist name. The second issue: There is something even more offensive than the team's name:  The fact that this case happened at all.  The decision, I believe, has First Amendment implications that we shouldn't ignore. I do not care whether you like or dislike the Washington Redskins' name. I think it's a pretty dumb thing to call a football team. If Native Americans believe that ""redskin"" is offensive to them, then it is. Most people agree that it is about as offensive as using any other ethnic slur. I respect their position and their argument. Seattle Times gets rid of 'Redskins,' joins rising tide against name . Nevertheless, here are my criticisms of this decision: Section (2)(a) of the Trademark Act bars the registration of any trademark that is ""immoral"" ""scandalous"" or ""disparaging.""  In other words, a civil servant executing the registration is allowed to be the arbiter of morality.  Do we really want that? Trademarks propose a commercial transaction. When you see or hear a trademark, you immediately receive information in a short-hand way that communicates where the products come from, or what level of service you can expect.  Trademarks are First Amendment protected expression.  There should be no issue with limiting their use to mislead the public.  After all, what point do they serve if they do not propose a truthful association with their owner?  And what rational governmental purpose does it serve to deny a benefit to a business because it might be deemed ""immoral"" by someone? And why are we even arguing the point? The government should not be in the business of deciding what is moral, immoral, or offensive. This section of the trademark act is a leftover from Victorian times, and is used now primarily to promote social agendas with coercive censorship. To justify such censorship, the government must demonstrate that the harms it seeks to address are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree. In addition,  the courts have found, such a restriction ""may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose.""  These mandates are ""critical,"" for otherwise ""[the government] could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression."" In this case, what is the governmental purpose in depriving the Redskins of their trademark registration?  Is it that the government is serving as a morality teacher?  Is it choosing a favored position, and then enforcing it by only giving government benefits to companies that agree with that orthodoxy? Do you trust any government to tell you what your morality should be?  If so, do you trust this government to do that? Remember, even if you're one of the well-intentioned many who think that the name is disgusting, do you want to surrender your First Amendment rights to the next group who might find your morality to be outside the norm? I do not.  While I think that Dan Snyder should change the name of his football team, I think that the government should remain neutral in the matter.","Marc Randazza: Redskins lost trademark registration for name.

"Rodney King's death in June was the result of accidental drowning, although alcohol, cocaine, marijuana and PCP found in his system were contributing factors, authorities said Thursday. King, whose beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 was caught on camera and sparked riots after the acquittal of the four officers involved, was found dead in the swimming pool at his Rialto, California, home on June 17, authorities and his fiancee said. He was 47. King was ""in a state of drug and alcohol-induced delirium"" and ""either fell or jumped into the swimming pool,"" said the autopsy report released by the San Bernardino County coroner Thursday. Family, friends remember Rodney King at funeral . ""The effects of the drugs and alcohol, combined with the subject's heart condition, probably precipitated a cardiac arrhythmia and the subject, thus incapacitated, was unable to save himself and drowned,"" the autopsy summary said. ""There is nothing in the history or autopsy examination to suggest suicide or homicide, and the manner of death is therefore judged to be accident."" No foul play is suspected and the police investigation of his death is closed, Rialto Police Capt. Randy De Anda told CNN. The autopsy findings are consistent with the police investigation's conclusion, De Anda said. Timeline of events in Rodney King's life . King's fiancee, Cynthia Kelly, found him at the bottom of the pool and called 911 for help at 5:25 a.m. on that Sunday morning, police said. Police removed him from the pool and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital, police said. Kelly, who was a juror in King's lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles in 1994, told police that King was an ""avid swimmer"" but that she was not, De Anda said. Kelley told investigators King was ""heavily intoxicated,"" and she went to sleep at 2:45 a.m. while he was still awake and drinking.  She later ""woke up to hear the subject pounding on the closed rear patio sliding glass door,"" the autopsy report said. ""She described him making grunting and growling sounds and have frothy secretions coming from his mouth."" King yelled to his girlfriend ""Baby come and help me,"" according to the report. ""The subject at that time was wearing his underwear down around his knees and then apparently fell backwards into the planter on the plant covering just east of the patio sliding glass door,"" it said. Kelley went back into the home to get her cell phone to call 911 for help, but she then ""heard a splash in the pool and went out to the backyard to find the subject face down on the bottom of the deep end of the pool,"" it said.  ""The girlfriend was not a good swimmer so she used a pitchfork and a hoe from the backyard to try to jab at the subject to arouse him."" King's brother, Zhan Paul King, told investigators that King has ""been doing very well and was happy"" as he traveled to promote a book for the 20th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots.  He ""seemed to have his life in order,"" the coroner's report said. He said his brother ""was no longer abusing hardcore street drugs or using Phencyclidine (PCP),"" the report said.  PCP was among the combination of drugs found in his blood during the autopsy. Nearly a year after the rioting in Los Angeles, four officers stood trial in federal court on civil rights charges. Two were found guilty and sentenced to 30 months in prison, and two were acquitted. King also sued the city of Los Angeles and was awarded $3.8 million in damages. Comments: 'Rodney King had demons.

"(CNN)For decades, U.S. climate change policy amounted to a hypocrisy associated with bad parenting: ""Do as I say, not as I do."" That began to change Monday when President Barack Obama's administration announced its boldest step yet to reduce the nation's biggest source of pollution blamed for global warming -- carbon emission from power plants. A proposed new Environmental Protection Agency rule would reduce such emissions 30% by 2030, compared to the levels in 2005. The move announced by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy was intended to show the world that the United States would walk the climate change talk, and establish Obama's environmental legacy as he enters the final third of his presidency. ""For the sake of our families' health and our kids' future, we have a moral obligation to act on climate,"" McCarthy said. ""When we do, we'll turn risks on climate into business opportunity. We'll spur innovation and investment, and we'll build a world-leading clean energy economy."" Obama later made a similar case in a conference call with the American Lung Association, noting that power plant pollution contributes to asthma and other diseases suffered by American kids, especially black and Latino youngsters. ""This beautiful blue ball in space"" ""This is something that is important for all of us,"" he said, urging support for efforts to work together to help protect ""this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space there we're a part of."" The announcement, expected for months, prompted immediate protests from the energy industry, Republicans and some Democrats from coal and oil states who complained the proposed EPA rules would harm the economy and raise energy prices. ""All the major legislative and regulatory proposals to combat global warming kill jobs and disproportionately hurt lower income people and minorities,"" the conservative National Center for Public Policy Research argued in a list of ""top 10 reasons Washington should not impose new global warming laws or regulations."" Nonsense, Obama shot back, noting how similar warnings always greeted major environmental progress in the past, but eventually proved untrue. ""What we've seen every time is that these claims are debunked when you actually give workers and business the tools and incentive they need to innovate,"" he said, citing previous government moves against air pollution and acid rain. Carbon pollution that increased dramatically since the industrial revolution of the 19th century corresponds to the warming of the global climate, and scientists predict rising oceans, volatile weather patterns, changing agriculture zones and other impacts in coming decades that will affect everyone on the planet and require an increasing percentage of national budgets to prevent catastrophic results. Energy industry campaign . A multimillion-dollar campaign backed by the energy industry has sought to debunk the science of climate change, but polls show most Americans believe the planet is warming. Almost a third of America's carbon emissions comes from electricity generation, and the proposed EPA rules announced Monday would give states a variety of options to meet the goal of an overall 30% reduction in such pollution by 2030. Some of the ideas already being used include improving energy efficiency at plants, changing how long they operate each day and increasing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar production. EPA officials concede some of the dirtiest power plants now operating, such as older coal-fired plants, will end up shuttered as the nation shifts its reliance from traditional fossil fuel sources to cleaner alternatives. Coal supplied 37% of U.S. electricity in 2012, compared to 30% from natural gas, 19% from nuclear power plants, 7% from hydropower sources such as dams and 5% from renewable sources such as wind and solar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By 2030, just over 30% of U.S. electricity will come from coal and about the same amount from natural gas, with wind, solar and other alternative sources providing about 9%, according to the EPA officials who spoke to reporters on Monday on the condition of not being identified. According to the EPA, the proposed new rules would reduce carbon pollution by the same amount as removing two-thirds of all cars and trucks form American roads. It put the cost as high as $8.8 billion a year, but noted health gains such as fewer premature deaths and respiratory diseases along with other benefits would be worth tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy. Higher costs or more opportunity? While critics contend the EPA rules will mean higher electricity costs, Obama and members of his administration argued the transformation to a more energy efficient power sector would bring lower electricity bills in the future. For Obama, another key motivation is to give the United States standing to pressure emerging economies in China, India and other countries to also adopt cleaner energy policies. Until now, U.S. calls for all players to participate in global climate change agreement went unheeded because developing countries argued America and other industrialized powers got rich while polluting, and now they should have the same chance to develop. At home, enemies of climate change legislation complained any U.S. steps would be meaningless, putting America at a disadvantage for policies that would do little on their own to reduce overall global emissions. White House spokesman Jay Carney told CNN on Monday that in order to get the kind of global buy-in necessary to achieve the kind of overall cuts in carbon emissions required to make a difference, the United States ""has to lead, first of all, and this is an indication that the United States will lead on this very important challenge posed by climate change and global warming."" The EPA will hold a public comment period and then revise the proposal over the next year. Under the proposed rule, states would have until June 30, 2016, to submit plans for achieving the reduced emissions target. States that need more time can submit an initial version by that date and explain the need for more time, with a final version due one or two years later, ""as appropriate,"" the proposed rule says. ""This is something we put off"" According to the EPA , the regulation will  ""reduce pollutants that contribute to the soot and smog that make people sick by over 25 percent."" The agency projects the reductions will avoid 2,700 to 6,600 premature deaths and 140,000 to 150,000 asthma attacks in children. ""This is something we can't put off, and the President deserves huge credit for making this his legacy,"" said David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Opponents were equally effusive in their condemnation. ""The administration has set out to kill coal and its 800,000 jobs,"" Sen. Mike Enzi said in the GOP weekly address Saturday. The Chamber of Commerce, a business federation, estimated the new regulations will cost the economy $50 billion a year. Obama's move could affect competitive Senate races in coal industry states such as Kentucky, North Carolina and Colorado at a time when Democrats are trying to keep control of the upper chamber. ""By imposing these draconian new rules on the nation's coal industry, President Obama and every other liberal lawmaker in Washington who quietly supports them is also picking regional favorites, helping their political supporters in states like California and New York while inflicting acute pain on states like Kentucky,"" said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is facing a re-election battle in November in the Bluegrass State. ""The impact on individuals and families and entire regions of the country will be catastrophic, as a proud domestic industry is decimated â€” and many of its jobs shipped overseas."" Some Democrats doubting . Some Democrats from fossil fuel states who face tough re-election battles, such as Sens. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Mark Pryor in Arkansas, expressed concern Monday with the proposed EPA rule but stopped short of condemning outright the need to address rising carbon emissions. Democratic Sen. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire, who also has a tough re-election challenge from former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, took her own regional approach to the matter, saying the EPA rule was needed to balance regulation of power plants. ""For too long, the Midwest has been allowed to lag behind New Hampshire and other New England states in addressing carbon pollution,"" she said, referring to acid rain regulations that affected her region. ""The draft EPA rules will get Midwest power plants to do what power plants in New England have already done and will decrease the air pollution that moves from the Midwest to our states."" Shaheen added that  ""we are already seeing the impact of climate change in New Hampshire, threatening many of our traditional industries and the health of our children,"" saying she would ""carefully review the proposed EPA rules to ensure they protect New Hampshire, but the time for national action is long overdue.""

"Kanye West has been called many things, but these days the best description -- according to him -- is family man. The 36-year-old rapper appeared on Kris Jenner's daytime talk show ""Kris"" on Friday to discuss his relationship with Jenner's daughter, Kim Kardashian, and their new addition, North. But if Kanye was smart, he'd hire Jenner as part of his PR team. The reality TV momager, who has extended her family's brand from E! to Fox with this test run of her talk show, reiterated several times that the stone-faced and difficult Kanye portrayed in the media is not the man she's come to know. (Kanye, after all, is now living in her home.) ""I'm so excited that I've gotten to know you like I have,"" Jenner said. ""There are a lot of things that people don't know about you that are so interesting to me that I want other people to hear."" Kanye spoke about the effect of the birth on his outlook. ""To me it's such a blessing, and I feel like it's going to give me the stability that I need to really create and really do God's work in the way I should,"" Kanye, wearing a ""what would Jesus do"" bracelet, told Jenner. ""Someone to be accountable, someone to be responsible for. After I lost my mother there were times I felt like I would put my life at risk, I felt like sometimes I didn't have something to live for. Now I have two really special people to live for, a whole family to live for. I want people, when they remember me and my family, their thought association to be someone who helped, someone who brought joy."" He did bring plenty of joy to Jenner's show, as she beamed while displaying North's photo for the audience. North, who was born June 15, has her mother's eyes and father's cheeks, according to Jenner. ""The thing I think about as a dad is just protection. That's my only goal, to Kanye said his goal is ""to protect my daughter. That's my instinct."" ""To give my daughter as many opportunities to just be a child. Of course, a big thing that plagues us is this idea of the paparazzi chasing a 5-year-old around and screaming at them. ... You have enough things to deal with and to learn being a new parent and you add that on top of it, and it becomes really intense."" According to Jenner, Kanye's been into his girlfriend for a long, long time, and would even use Photoshop to draw himself into the yearly Kardashian-Jenner Christmas card. (Seriously -- Jenner showed proof.) Although he couldn't quite remember the first time he met Kardashian, 32, Kanye did know it was love at first sight. ""I'm trying to remember if the first time we met was her being in the studio when she was Brandy's assistant, and I think she brought us in, like, something to drink,"" he said. ""Or it might've been when I was doing Brandy's video and I remember asking my manager, 'Who is that girl right there?' ... I was in love with her before I even got to talk to her."" Kim, he said, was always someone he dreamed about being with, but more importantly, he feels that they're ""equally yoked."" ""Being in the limelight, you have to have a match, or someone that's equally yoked,"" he told Jenner. ""It's difficult, because there's people that you would date who would try to date you to maybe be more famous, or people who would want you to be less famous than you were, and just not accept who you are in life. And when I would be on the phone with her, even at my lowest moments, she'd give me energy and remind me of who I was. And I needed that support at all times."" Kanye knows that there are those who think he and the Kardashian family wouldn't have much in common. But he's trying to grow both spiritually -- ""I'm a Christian,"" he said, ""That's what's important to me, that I grow and walk and raise my family with Christian values."" ""People feel that me and my girlfriend's mother are of different brands in a way,"" he said. ""But it's not about any of us being at odds, it's about us helping each other and improving each other. I might be one of the only guys in the world that knows how to pick out a pair of shoes for a girl, but I have improvements that I need to make as a human being ... the way that I talk to people, being too sharp with people, or being too edgy. As a creative guy, sometimes it's hard for me to small talk. ...  And that's something that (the Kardashian) family and Kim are teaching me, helping me to be a better person."" Given the negative press he's had -- from that infamous mic-jacking at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to more recent run-ins with the paparazzi --  does he have any regrets? Not exactly. While there are things he wishes he could change, he also believes that ""everything happened for a reason, and I've grown from it,"" he said. ""I feel that I'm very, very, very blessed, and with that comes great responsibility. With the way my parents raised me and the information that they gave me and this feeling that I have that I want to help, I think anything that could be considered a mistake will help me to make better decisions in the future.""","Kanye West appeared on Kris Jenner's talk show Friday .

"A trumpeter played a Mariachi-style ""Star-Spangled Banner"" as protesters sparred around him in an Arizona city that's become the latest flashpoint in the national immigration debate. Oracle will soon house several dozen detained unaccompanied immigrant children from Central America. In the city about 100 miles north of the Mexico border, word of their impending arrival fueled passionate demonstrations Tuesday from supporters who welcomed them and critics pushing for their deportation. Video from CNN affiliate KPNX showed a man holding a neon poster with the famous phrase inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty written with a marker: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Another demonstrator held a sign that said, ""Send 'em to Coyote Obama,"" describing the U.S. President with a popular term used for smugglers who help immigrants illegally cross the border. ""I'm protesting the invasion of the United States by people of foreign countries. This is about the sovereignty of our nation,"" Oracle resident Eldon Rhodes told CNN affiliate KVOA. ""You're just lucky. You're not better,"" a pro-immigrant demonstrator shouted at protesters, according to KPNX. ""None of you are better than them."" Have you witnessed protests or taken part? Share your images . Demonstrators who supported the immigrants said they were worried that protests would create a negative national image for their town. ""We are concerned that Oracle not be viewed as monolithically anti-immigrant, anti-children. We think the angels of our better nature need to be reflected through efforts like this one,"" Frank Pierson, a 35-year resident who's also president of St. Helen Catholic Church parish council, told CNN affiliate KGUN. The face-off is taking place after a similar demonstration in Murrieta, California, led to vitriolic exchanges about how the U.S. immigration system is being overwhelmed by a tide of Central American migrants. The Murrieta protesters blocked three busloads of detained immigrants from entering the town for federal processing. The demonstrations in Oracle come as activists organize a nationwide movement protesting the immigration surge with at least 260 protests scheduled this weekend. ""We are being invaded!"" says a flyer distributed by 11 groups organized as National Day of Protesting Against Immigration Reform, Amnesty and Border Surge. ""Our Border Patrol is overwhelmed by the massive flow of illegal aliens crossing our border daily."" Local sheriff worries . In Arizona, protesters were lining up on both sides of a road where the vehicles of detained juvenile migrants were expected to pass. Protesters positioned themselves to block the road and held ""No open borders"" signs. Counterprotesters, however, held ""Bienvenidos Welcome"" signs. Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said he told protesters to stop blocking the road. But the sheriff has entered the fray by expressing concern about how the federal government hasn't told his agency about the transfer of the detained youths to his county. He's also drawn criticism for publicly revealing the location where the minors are being taken. ""I believe the public has a right to know,"" Babeu told CNN's AC360 Tuesday. ""I would rather err on that side, rather than to be secretive, as this whole operation was initially done."" Babeu has said he wants the federal government to provide more information about the migrants. Some of them, he said, may have gang affiliations. ""My question to Homeland Security was, 'Give us a sense of the profile of these individuals,'"" he said. The Pinal County Sheriff's Office was recently ""informed by 'whistle blowers' in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security they plan to transfer between 40 and 60 unaccompanied illegal minors to the 'Sycamore Canyon Boys Ranch' in Oracle,"" the office said in a statement on its Facebook page. ""If you're going to send unaccompanied juveniles to another state in another jurisdiction, there's legitimate concern that other members of this community have about public safety and public health,"" the sheriff said. ""Give us the information."" The Sycamore Canyon Academy in Oracle aims to help young men who may be struggling at home or in school. But it's not where the expected group of immigrant children should go, Sheriff Babeu said. ""These children should be returned to their home country -- not to Oracle, Arizona paid for by American taxpayers,"" Babeu said in the statement. ""We understand there will be protesters who support and oppose ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) bringing the foreign juveniles to Oracle. The Sheriff's Office will work to ensure the peace is maintained at these lawful assemblies."" A mix of poverty, violence and smugglers' false promises has led to an influx of Central Americans -- including minors -- illegally entering the United States. Tuesday's protest came a day after the federal government deported its first group of the recent wave of undocumented Central American immigrants to Honduras. They were about 40 adults and children who had been recently held at a facility in Artesia, New Mexico. More deportations to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are expected soon, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said. Not alone . The tensions in Oracle mirror the strife this month in Murrieta. On July 1, a wall of angry protesters blocked three buses of undocumented immigrants from entering their community and forced them to turn around. Demonstrators in Murrieta quarreled with counterprotesters over the country's immigration system. ""I just wish America would be America again because it's not, and it's not just pointed to the Hispanics,"" protester Ellen Meeks said. ""Everybody needs to go through the legal ways."" But immigration rights advocate Enrique Morones likened the migration to a refugee crisis and suggested that racial antipathy was motivating protesters. ""If these children were from Canada, we would not be having this interview,"" he told CNN. ""The parents have had enough. They are saying, 'If I don't send my child north, they are going to die.' "" A national protest day . This weekend, at least 11 groups are organizing what they describe as ""the largest coordinated protest against all forms of amnesty, comprehensive immigration reform, and the government's failure to enforce immigration laws and secure our borders will begin, all across America."" At least 260 protests will include demonstrations at state capitols and Mexican consulates and on freeway overpasses. Groups in California, Texas and Florida scheduled the lion's share of events. Among the sponsoring groups are the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, which describes itself as a resource on illegal immigration; and the Tea Party Community, which calls itself ""a conservative hub for sharing ideas."" Their flyer makes strong assertions: ""Illegal aliens with communicable diseases and conditions such as tuberculosis, scabies, and head lice are entering our country unabated. There is a very real security risk to Americans from drug cartels, gang members, and terrorists -- all of whom can cross our border with no resistance. Adding insult to injury, American taxpayers are being forced to pay for transportation, housing, schooling, legal assistance, and more for the illegals crossing our border."" The organizers didn't immediately respond to a CNN e-mail seeking further comment. Michigan protest . On Monday, residents in Vassar, Michigan, protested against any undocumented juvenile immigrants coming to Tuscola County under a local social service agency's proposal, according to CNN affiliate WJRT. At a special Vassar City Council meeting Monday, members of Michigan Immigration Control and Enforcement told elected leaders they don't want the juveniles in their town, the station reported. Vassar Mayor Pro Tem Dan Surgent also opposed any local agency's plans to house the youths and blamed Obama for the crisis, saying he is ""a President that you can't trust, you can't believe him,"" the affiliate reported. ""We are not insensitive, we are not a bunch of white racists out here, like they like to portray us. We love children. Otherwise, if we didn't care of about kids, we wouldn't have let Pioneer Work and Learn 22 years ago,"" Surgent said, according to WJRT. He was referring to the Pioneer Work and Learn Center, which is a youth program of Wolverine Human Services, the agency proposing to house the youngsters, the affiliate said. Federal officials couldn't be immediately reached for comment. One welcoming place . Not everyone is protesting the immigrants. More than 40 miles north of Murrieta, residents in Fontana, California, have been welcoming. Share your immigration stories . Last Thursday, 46 immigrants carrying temporary visas arrived at St. Joseph Catholic Church aboard a Homeland Security bus. That church is providing temporary housing in a former convent beside the church. The migrant children were accompanied by their mothers, and the diocese said the families have been issued temporary visas. Many of the migrants are waiting to be reunited with their families in the Midwest and on the East Coast. Petra Alexander, director of Hispanic affairs at the San Bernardino Diocese, said it's important to help the immigrants. ""We have hope and we have received a lot of support and have been criticized, but we are sure that God's dream is that we all live like a family,"" Alexander said. ""We are always going to come across people who are opposed. This is nothing new, and the church is supporting everyone, no matter the religion or your race."" Poll on President, Congress . A new national poll indicates that a majority of Americans approve of Obama's short-term remedy, but most give the President and his Republican critics in Congress a thumbs-down on how they're handling the crisis along the country's southern border. An ABC News/Washington Post survey, conducted July 9-13 and released Tuesday, found that 53% support the White House plan to spend $3.7 billion to immediately deal with the situation, with 43% saying they disapprove of the proposal. The survey shows an expected partisan divide, with two-thirds of Democrats supporting the Obama plan. That number drops to 51% among independents and down to 35% among Republicans. Hispanics questioned in the poll support the proposal, 54% to 43%. Even though a majority back the President's proposal, only a third of Americans give Obama a thumbs-up on how he's handling the issue of undocumented immigrants entering the country, and only 23% of those questioned say they approve of how congressional Republicans are dealing with the crisis. Even Republicans are divided (48% approval to 45% disapproval) on how federal lawmakers from their own party are handling the issue. The poll questioned 1,016 adults nationwide by telephone. Its sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

"The parents of North West have made it official. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West tied the knot at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, on Saturday, Kardashian's publicist told CNN. People reported Kardashian was walked down the aisle by Bruce Jenner while Andrea Bocelli sang ""Con te Partiró""; and Kris Jenner was seen in the front row wiping her eyes during the ceremony. Guests reportedly broke into applause twice during the ceremony: first when the couple kissed and when the newlyweds were presented. The wedding capped off a weekend of extravagant European affairs, starting with a brunch hosted by fashion designer Valentino in Paris on Friday. Later that evening, hundreds of guests were invited to the Palace of Versailles for a private tour and a surprise performance by Lana Del Ray. According to E!, the couple then flew guests to Florence for the wedding ceremony. The city has special meaning to them; Kanye said they conceived their daughter, North, there ""among the masterpieces of the Renaissance. This is the third marriage for Kardashian and West's first. The couple got engaged in October 2013, as seen on TV, after Kardashian gave birth to their daughter. But theirs was apparently a love affair years in the making. Reportedly it took the rapper nine years to finally win the woman of his dreams, but it was in March 2012 when they appeared together at Paris Fashion Week together that they were officially an item.

"It's starting to feel like Groundhog Day for women in corporate America. Another year, another story of zero growth for women when it comes to holding corporate board seats and executive office positions, according to a new report by Catalyst, a nonprofit focused on women and business. For the eighth year in a row, the group found no significant change in the number of female members of corporate boards, with women holding 16.9% of board seats in 2013 versus 16.6% last year. And while there was big news earlier this week when Mary Barra was named GM's new chief executive officer -- the first woman to head a major U.S. automaker -- there has been no uptick in the total number of female executive leaders for the fourth year in a row, according to Catalyst. Last year, women had 14.3% of executive officer positions, and this year the percentage is nearly the same, 14.6%. ""I would look at the numbers and say, for those companies who are not making the advancement of women to leadership a priority, they should really be embarrassed,"" said Deborah Gillis, Catalyst's chief operating officer, who will take over as president and chief executive officer in January. ""There is absolutely no excuse in 2013 to continue to have women underrepresented to this degree in the leadership of Fortune 500 companies."" Consider Twitter, where women weren't just underrepresented on the company's board -- they didn't exist. That is, until earlier this month when the company, after criticism of its all-male board, named its first female board member: Marjorie Scardino, the former chief executive officer of a London-based education and media conglomerate. Why no change for women at the top? The big question is: Why so little movement for women? Why -- at a time when women make up half the labor force, when there has been plenty of research on how a diverse board and leadership team of men and women improves a company's bottom line and when women have been thinking more about ""leaning in"" through marriage and motherhood -- are we finding absolutely no change for women at the top? Tom Falk is chairman and chief executive officer of Kimberly-Clark Corp., one of the 20% of companies where women hold one-quarter or more of executive officer positions. In fact, at Kimberly-Clark, four out of 10 executive officers are women and 25% of the board's seats are held by women. In his view, the issue isn't about equity or fairness, but attracting the best talent, which benefits a company's bottom line. ""Malcolm Gladwell tells a very simple analogy,"" said Falk, a Catalyst board member, during a phone interview. ""If you and I were going to pick an all-star team and we had a room with a hundred people in it and you got to pick your share of the team from the whole hundred people and I only got to pick from 50 people on the right side of the room, who would have a better team? You would,"" he said. ""For some reason, I think lots of management teams aren't seeing it that way. They're picking the best athlete for a role, but they are not really insisting on a diverse slate and looking broadly to make sure they've got talent from all the best pools that are available to them,"" said Falk, a 30-year company veteran. What stands in the way of women . Charlotte Laurent-Ottomane is executive director of The Thirty Percent Coalition, a national advocacy organization focused on getting 30% of board seats in the United States to be held by women by the end of 2015. One big stumbling block for women, she said, is the length of term limits on boards, which, on average, are about 10 years. ""If you are not renewing your board, regardless of who your candidates are, except for every 10 to 20 years, then you are obviously not going to bring any new candidates in."" Laurent-Ottomane also said the composition of many boards is a problem: ""If you take a board (where) the leadership is only considering sitting or former CEOs of their industry, which I think most corporate governance experts would agree ... is not a healthy approach ... obviously, you are not going to get women because it goes all the way down the food chain."" Part of the challenge, too, is convincing male leaders there's not a limited supply of strong female candidates. Men and women see different reasons for why there aren't more women on corporate boards, according to a survey of more than 1,000 board members from around the world in 2010, 2011 and 2012 by Harvard Business School professor Boris Groysberg and researcher Deborah Bell. ""When it came to trying to understand ... why we are not making as much progress having more women on boards, you had male board directors who basically said, 'You know what, there's not enough supply,'"" said Groysberg, who created a class at Harvard Business School focusing on ways to get more women on corporate boards. ""Then you have another side -- you have female boards of directors who are basically saying it has nothing to do with supply. What's happening is that it's impossible to get on boards. So you have two very different explanations,"" he said. Falk, the CEO, shared a story from an executive many years ago who wanted to hire a female sales rep on his team. ""His group that was doing the hiring came back and said, 'You know what, we've looked and looked and we just can't find good female sales reps. Can we just hire from our usual sources?'"" ""He said, 'Well, I'll tell you what: I want to first interview all the females that you've rejected.' So guess what? They went out and found some female sales reps."" What works to add female leaders . While the story for women in corporate America hasn't changed much over the last several years, there's a completely different narrative for women in many other countries. ""The bottom line is countries around the world are paying attention,"" said Gillis of Catalyst. ""The key is, they're saying this is a priority and we need to act now."" In Australia, the country launched a ""Male Champion of Change Initiative,"" which, among other measures, includes having companies publicly disclose their gender diversity targets. Since then, women's share of executive officer positions jumped from 8.3% in 2009 to 16.6% in 2013, Gillis said. In England, after a call for companies to voluntarily increase targets for the number of women in leadership, women's representation in the FTSE 100 Index or the ""footsie"" -- the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange -- jumped to almost 19% from 12.5% in 2011, according to Catalyst. Some European countries, like Norway, have gone further, mandating controversial quotas, requiring a certain number of seats of every company's board be filled by women. Laurent-Ottomane of The Thirty Percent Coalition likes much of what other countries are doing, but said she believes quotas wouldn't be effective in the United States. ""Quotas basically force companies to bring in candidates just to achieve (a) goal, and I'm not sure that's necessarily the most healthy way to put a board together,"" she said. The key, Laurent-Ottomane said, is getting the commitment and engagement of corporate leaders themselves. ""If corporate leaders engage and work together and try to determine tactically how we do this, I think that we will be successful,"" she said. Putting diversity on the agenda . Falk, who has been leading Kimberly-Clark for 10 years, said he probably didn't put enough emphasis on the issue of advancement for women early in his tenure as CEO. ""I had women on my team. I was supporting the diversity, but it wasn't enough on my leadership agenda. I wasn't pushing hard enough on it so my board pushed me to say, 'Hey, you've been going sideways for a couple of years on this. What are you going to do to get it on your agenda?'"" Groysberg's new class at Harvard focuses on what women can do to build their careers, what organizations can do to create more inclusive cultures and what governments can do to help. For many reasons, he sees a personal stake in the future. ""I have four children, two are girls and they're pretty young,"" he said. ""I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that I helped to build companies in 10 years that will be much, much more receptive to my daughters than the companies that I know exist in 2013.""

"He was a 20-year-old man who, by multiple accounts, was incredibly smart and quiet. He didn't appear to have any run-ins with the law. But Adam Lanza's seemingly innocuous life was thrust into the spotlight when authorities said he perpetrated the second deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. On Friday morning, Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, dressed in black battle fatigues and a military vest"" and began firing, according to a law enforcement source. By the time he was done, 26 were dead -- 20 of them young students. The bloodshed ended when Lanza's own life did. He was found dead in a classroom with three firearms: a .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle and two pistols, a Glock and a Sig Sauer. Before Friday's rampage, authorities said, Lanza killed his mother in their home in Newtown's Sandy Hook community. Comforting survivors: 'Hug them' and 'cry with them' The mass tragedy left people in the Connecticut town, around the country, around the world asking questions. Who was this man, and why did he do this? Lanza moved to Connecticut from Kingston, New Hampshire, with his parents and older brother Ryan, according to a booklet for the town's Newtown's Bennetts Farm neighborhood. He enjoyed soccer, skateboarding and video games, the publication said. In September 2009 -- when Lanza was 17 -- his mother and father divorced, court documents show. What happened after that for him isn't clear, except that he lived in the picturesque, 300-year-old Connecticut town. His father, Peter, remarried and lived not far from Newtown, an official said. He was questioned by authorities after the shooting. So, too, was his 24-year-old brother Ryan. Authorities have offered few details about Lanza. He had no known criminal record, a law enforcement official said. Slain Connecticut principal just implemented new security system . One of Lanza's aunts, Marsha, described him as a ""quiet, nice kid,"" but he had issues with learning, she said. Her husband is Lanza's paternal uncle. ""He was definitely the challenge of the family in that house. Every family has one,"" she told CNN affiliate WLS. ""They have one. I have one. But never in trouble with the law, never in trouble with anything."" She said Lanza's mother ""battled"" with the school board and ended up having her son home-schooled. ""She had issues with school,"" the aunt, who lives in Crystal Lake, Illinois, said. ""I'm not 100% certain if it was behavior or learning disabilities, but he was a very, very bright boy. He was smart."" Alex Israel was in the same class at Newtown High School with Lanza, and lived a few houses down from him. ""You could definitely tell he was a genius,"" Israel told CNN, adding she hadn't talked with him since middle school. ""He was really quiet, he kept to himself."" Others in Newtown who knew Lanza said they had no idea he'd ever be responsible for such horror. His former bus driver, Marsha Moskowitz, told CNN affiliate WABC that he was ""a nice kid, very polite"" like his brother. ""It's a shock to even know (the family),"" she said. ""You can't understand what happened."" A relative told investigators that Lanza had a form of autism, according to a law enforcement official, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation. But a national autism committee cautioned against speculating about any link between autism and violence. ""Some public comments have drawn potentially inaccurate and stigmatizing conclusions about a link between the diagnosis and a propensity for violence and lack of empathy,"" according to a statement from the Autism Research Institute's Autistic Global Initiative Project. ""Autism is not a mental health disorder - it is a neurodevelopmental disorder. ... The eyes of the world are on this wrenching tragedy -- with 1 in 88 now diagnosed, misinformation could easily trigger increased prejudice and misunderstanding."" A former classmate told CNN affiliate WCBS that Lanza ""was just a kid"" -- not a troublemaker, not anti-social, not suggesting in any way that he could erupt like this. ""I don't know who would do anything like this,"" the classmate said, before walking away distraught. ""This is unspeakable."" How do we stop the violence? The suspect's father was also at a loss for explanation. He sent his condolences to the families of victims in a statement released Saturday. ""Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy,"" he said. ""No words can truly express how heartbroken we are. We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can.""","Officials: Lanza killed 26 people at a school and his mother before he was found dead .

"The first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome believed to be transmitted within the United States has been identified in an Illinois man who was infected and is no longer sick, a doctor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday. The unidentified Illinois man had ""extended face-to-face contact"" during a 40-minute business meeting with an Indiana man who was diagnosed with MERS after traveling from Saudi Arabia, Dr. David Swerdlow told reporters during a telephone briefing. A blood test confirmed the Illinois man had been previously infected, and he reported suffering only mild cold-like symptoms and did not seek or require medical care, Swerdlow said. ""We think that this patient was likely infected with MERS. But technically he doesn't count as an official case of MERS,"" he said. The case does not meet the World Health Organization definition of an active case, which requires evidence of a live virus, according to Swordlow. Even so, U.S. health officials appear to be treating it as one. MERS: 5 things to know . U.S. investigation . The case was discovered as part of an investigation by U.S. health officials to track people who came in close contact with the Indiana man, who became the first person diagnosed with MERS in the United States. He was diagnosed with the virus on May 2. MERS, first found in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, is a coronavirus -- the same group of viruses as the common cold. It attacks the respiratory system. Symptoms, which include fever and a cough, are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have also been seen, according to the WHO. There is no vaccine or special treatment, and it can be fatal in up to one-third of cases, Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general for the U.S. Public Health Service told CNN recently. To date, there have been more than 570 confirmed cases of MERS, including 171 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The number of countries with confirmed cases expanded to 18, with a case in the Netherlands, according to the WHO. Many of the cases are in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. No one knows exactly how the virus originated, but evidence implicating camels is emerging. In a recently published study in mBio, researchers said they isolated live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. They found multiple substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient. 2 health care workers exposed to MERS patient . Indiana case . The Illinois case was discovered as part of an investigation by U.S. health officials who tracked the movements and contacts of the Indiana man, who was an American health care provider who had been working in Saudi Arabia and was on a planned visit to Indiana to see his family. He traveled April 24 from Riyadh to London, then to Chicago, and took a bus to Indiana, officials said. The Indiana man ""had extended face-to-face contact with a business associate (Illinois man) on April 25, and then another brief contact on April 26,"" Swerdlow said. The Indiana began experiencing shortness of breath, coughing, and fever on April 27, the Indiana State Department of Health has said. He was admitted to Community Hospital in Munster, Indiana, on April 28, the same day he visited the emergency department there, the health department said. The man was released from the hospital last week. Health officials tested 53 health care workers, six family member and an additional business associate. The MERS virus appears to have presented differently in the Illinois man, who reported only mild-like cold symptoms. ""There is a broader spectrum of MERS than first thought... you can have no symptoms,"" Swerdlow said. There are no travel restrictions to the Arabian Peninsula; however, the CDC suggests that people who visit there monitor their health and watch for any flu-like symptoms. If you do feel unwell after such a trip, be sure to tell your doctor about your travel. Second MERS case confirmed in Netherlands .

"Twenty-two years later, she has a name. The little girl known only as ""Baby Hope,"" whose abused and decomposed body was found in an ice chest by the side of a New York roadway in 1991, is 4-year-old Anjelica Castillo, New York police announced Saturday. Police also announced the arrest of the man they say killed Anjelica and dumped her body along the Henry Hudson Parkway. The man, Conrado Juarez, 52, is the girl's cousin. He has been charged with murder. Detectives from the New York Police Department's Cold Case Apprehension Squad never stopped searching for answers in the case. Each year, on the anniversary of the July 23, 1991, discovery of her body, they would canvass nearby neighborhoods, handing out fliers and asking people for information. Who was the girl? Who was her family? Who killed her? It was an anonymous tip called in after the latest canvass in July that helped crack the case, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. It led detectives to Anjelica's sister, now an adult; from there, they identified the woman believed to be the girl's mother, he said. ""That individual's actions were the catalyst for this most recent lead,"" Kelly said, referring to Juarez's arrest. He is Anjelica's cousin on her father's side. Police arrested Juarez after questioning him near the Manhattan restaurant where he worked as a dishwasher, Kelly said. He was expressionless as police led him in handcuffs past reporters. Juarez admitted to the crime Saturday morning, Kelly said. ""Today, NYPD investigators have given young Anjelica her due justice,"" said Chief of Detectives Phil Pulaski. Construction workers found the body of Anjelica -- who was never reported missing -- bound and in a garbage bag, hidden under some soda cans inside a blue and white cooler. She had been smothered and sexually molested, and her body was so badly decomposed that several sketches were made to suggest what she looked like. Two years after she was found, the girl was laid to rest in a donated plot, buried in a white dress bought by a detective's wife, with a tombstone paid for by detectives. ""Because we care"" is the inscription at the bottom of the tombstone, Pulaski said. Juarez, who was 30 at the time of the crime, said he went to an apartment in Queens shared by seven of his relatives and saw Anjelica in the hallway, Kelly said. Juarez told police he smothered her with a pillow while raping her. When the girl went motionless, Juarez told police, he summoned his sister from another room. It was the sister who told Juarez to get rid of the body and who provided the cooler, Kelly said. He then ""folded the girl in half,"" tied her, placed her in a garbage bag inside the cooler and placed soda cans on top of her body, said New York Assistant District Attorney Melissa Mourges during Juaraez's arraignment Saturday night. Juarez and his sister hailed a cab to Manhattan, dropped the cooler off in a wooded area near the parkway, and then went their separate ways, authorities said. The sister, Balvena Juarez Ramirez, is deceased, Kelly said. Retired Det. Jerry Giorgio, who worked on the case from the start, said he was ""elated"" at news of the arrest. ""You know the expression, 'I'm on cloud nine'? Well, that's where I am right now,"" Giorgio told reporters. Giorgio told CNN the killer's identity was out of the blue. He said he was certain the killer was Anjelica's mother, father, or both. Changes in forensic science also helped propel the investigation, Kelly said. The girl's body was exhumed in 2006, and a DNA profile was built in 2011. Earlier this month the office of the chief medical examiner made a DNA match between the girl and her mother. From there, investigators constructed a family tree, and the trail led them to Juarez, Kelly said. Kelly praised the ""phenomenal persistence"" of the detectives who originally worked on the case and those now working with the cold case squad. ""They were unrelenting,"" he said.","Juarez, the girl's cousin, is charged with murder .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama wished the nation a happy Thanksgiving on Thursday and also used his weekly address to renew his call for bipartisan cooperation on addressing major issues facing the nation. In the remarks usually delivered on a Saturday, Obama said the first family will have the same kind of holiday experienced by millions of Americans -- filled with friends and relatives, good food and football. ""And just as folks have done in every Thanksgiving since the first, we'll spend some time taking stock of what we're thankful for: the God-given bounty of America and the blessings of one another,"" the president said. The White House menu Thursday featured traditional Thanksgiving fare, including turkey, ham, two kinds of stuffing, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie, along with macaroni and cheese, greens and five other kinds of pie. Obama called for Americans to think about those less fortunate and saluted the ""countless"" Americans serving their country and communities, from soldiers on guard around the world to volunteers at local soup kitchens and food pantries. On Thursday morning, Obama called 10 members of the military -- two from each the Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Navy -- deployed in the U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the White House said. The president ""thanked each of them for their service and sacrifice and wished them and their families a Happy Thanksgiving,"" the White House statement said. The day before, the first family spent an hour handing out Thanksgiving dinner packages to people at Martha's Table, a local aid organization. Such service is ""emblematic of what Americans have always done,"" Obama said in his weekly address. ""We come together and do what's required to make tomorrow better than today,"" he said. ""That's who we are."" That means supporting the nation's soldiers and working together to help spur faster economic recovery from the recession, he said. ""But we won't do it as any one political party,"" he said. ""We've got to do it as one people. And in the coming weeks and months, I hope that we can work together, Democrats and Republicans and independents alike, to make progress on these and other issues."" Noting his scheduled meeting Tuesday with congressional leaders from both parties, Obama said it was time for ""a real and honest discussion, because I believe that if we stop talking at one another and start talking with one another, we can get a lot done."" ""For what we are called to do again today isn't about Democrats or Republicans,"" he said. ""It's not about left or right. It's about us. It's about what we know this country is capable of. It's about what we want America to be in this new century.""","NEW: President Obama calls troops on Thanksgiving .

"(CNN)Two Muslims were burnt alive and another beaten to death in eastern India following the murder of a Hindu man. Muslim-owned houses in a village in Bihar state's Muzaffarpur district were attacked and set on fire Sunday after the body of a Hindu man, reported missing since January 11, was discovered in a field, police spokesman Gupteshwar Pandey told CNN. The victim's father claimed his son was abducted for an apparent relationship with a Muslim woman, Pandey said. At least 14 arrests have been made so far, Pandey said. Muslims make up almost 13% of India's 1.2 billion mainly Hindu population. But the two communities have a history of violent -- occasionally deadly -- clashes. In 2002, more than 50 people were killed in the western state of Gujarat after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was set alight, allegedly by local Muslims. Eleven people were sentenced to death and 20 others were jailed for life for their roles in the attack, which sparked days of rioting across the region that left more than 1,000 people dead. In September 2013, more than 60 people -- most of them Muslim -- died during sectarian rioting in the Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh state.","Three Muslims killed in attacks following the murder of a Hindu man in India's Bihar state .

"The U.S. House on Tuesday approved a 10-year extension of a federal law requiring that all guns be detectable by metal screening machines. But partisan wrangling could still mean the Undetectable Firearms Act, approved 25 years ago, will expire next Monday. The law prohibits guns that don't contain enough metal to trigger screening machines commonly found in airports, courthouses and other secure areas accessible to the public. It has become an issue with the advent of 3-D printers, which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives recently said its tests showed are capable of producing lethal firearms entirely made of plastic. ATF tests show 3-D guns lethal as metal detection law expires . A one-sentence bill by Rep. Howard Coble, R-North Carolina, was approved easily by House lawmakers and sent to the Senate. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats want any extension to also deal with potential loopholes for 3-D-printed guns, which the House bill does not do. Currently, plastic guns made using 3-D printers comply with the law by inserting a removable metal block. That has led to worries that plastic guns could pass through metal detectors without being flagged by simply removing the block, which isn't required for a 3-D-printed gun to operate. Plastic components have become common in popular guns, but commercial manufacturers often use metal as a permanent part of the gun to comply with the law. Proposals to extend the law have languished for months. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats want an extension to also take into account the new technology, by making all guns be required to contain metal in the functioning parts of the firearm. The White House said it supported reauthorization of the ""commonsense gun safety"" measure. ""But Congress should work to close any loopholes that make it possible to evade the law with new technologies,"" said White House spokesman Matt Lehrich. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, is sponsoring a one-year extension of the law, arguing it would give lawmakers time to come up with a new measure that would tighten the rules to require metal parts in guns. Texas company makes metal gun with 3-D printer . Schumer has said he'll try to get his bill passed next week. ""The House bill is better than nothing, but it's not good enough,"" Schumer said. ""We absolutely must close the loophole that allows anyone to legally make a gun that could be rendered invisible by the easy removal of its metal part. Under current law, it is legal to make a plastic gun so long as it has some metal in it, even if it is easily removable. The bill we'll try to pass in the Senate would fix that."" Republicans say Democrats are refusing to work with them to pass a longer-term extension of the law. ""The (Democratic) majority is playing politics with public safety,"" Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley said last week after Democrats tried a legislative maneuver to pass Schumer's one-year extension. ""It doesn't meet the common-sense test to only reauthorize an extension of the Undetectable Firearms Act for a short year,"" Grassley said. With the Senate out on a break and not returning to work until Monday, it remains unlikely legislation will be ready to take its place.","Law requiring all guns include enough metal to be detected during screening to expire .

"They have money, youth, ample amounts of free time and now a bit of fame. So what's next for the much maligned people featured on the hit site Rich Kids of Instagram? Some are grounded from over-sharing on the Internet, others embarrassed by the attention and some might be heading for TV. The Tumblr blog sprung to life on July 13 and was an instant hit. It is a collection of photos found on Instagram that capture young wealthy people enjoying a life of minimally employed opulence: They're on lavish vacations, taking the most expensive modes of transportation, showing off designer belongings and doing all manner of things with and to champagne. Mixed in with the fun (seriously, who wouldn't want to water-slide off a yacht?) are less creative attempts to brag, like sepia-shaded photos of exorbitant restaurant receipts. ""A few glasses of wine and some misspelled Instagram searches led to its creation,"" the anonymous brains behind Rich Kids of Instagram, or RKOI, told CNN. Many of the images featured on the Tumblr were tagged with keywords on Instagram that made them easy to find, like #wealth, #mansion and #yacht. There's a Hilton, a Trump and a Brant in the mix, but many of the smartphone-photography enthusiasts are relatively unknown, for now. Tony Hawk fights crime with Instagram . While the reaction to the Tumblr has been largely one of disgust and anger -- ""Pretty sad how those Rich Kids of Instagram will never know the value of a hard days OH MY GOD I HATE THEM SO MUCH,"" tweeted Josh Hara -- some of the kids are enjoying the attention. The blog's creators said they've had requests from people who want to be featured on the site. Many Instagramers are unselfconsciously tagging their photos with the #rkoi hashtag, hoping to get featured on the blog. ""I believe that the people who are outraged may be a little jealous,"" said Tom Ierna, a 19-year-old self-described ""entrepreneur, New Yorker, blogger, mogul."" Ierna's photos have been featured on RKOI multiple times -- one shows him in front of a large yacht in the Hamptons and another is an image of a Versace gold-plated AK47. (He does not own the gun; he just snapped a photo of it in an East Hampton boutique.) The public's fascination with these kids has not gone unnoticed by Hollywood, where wealthy personalities are a huge draw on shows like ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" and the ""Real Housewives"" series. Naturally, a reality TV casting agent has been reaching out to many of the blog's subjects. ""They seem to have huge personalities and would be amazing on TV,"" said Lexi Shoemaker, a casting agent who has worked on hits like ""The Biggest Loser"" and Bravo's ""Tabatha's Salon Takeover."" She would not share any details about her current project, but said the kids she had contacted had been receptive so far. ""I would consider doing a reality show, it would be a very smart business decision,"" said Ierna, who said he has been offered a spot on a reality TV show in the past but turned it down. He did not say if he was contacted by Shoemaker. 'Real World' star found dead . Not everyone is interested in the fame. The Tumblr's creators have received a few requests to remove images and other photos have been deleted from Instagram by their owners. Luckily, most of the originals live on in all their gilded glory on the RKOI site. ""My friends and I don't want to be associated with this. This is very embarrassing,"" Annabel Schwartz told ""Good Morning America."" The 19-year-old posted an image of herself and four friends in front of a helicopter while on vacation in Saint-Tropez. She has not deleted the public photo from her Instagram. Alexa Dell, daughter of Dell CEO Michael Dell, had her social media presence quickly scrubbed from the Internet after a photo of her brother on a private plane to Fiji, feasting on a spread of fruit 3-feet deep, made it to the RKOI blog. Bloomberg Businessweek dug into a Dell regulatory filing and reported that the Dell family pays approximately $2.7 million a year for personal security. Between her active Instagram and Twitter accounts, Alexa Dell was leaving a trail of information, including locations and timing of trips, that could have been used by kidnappers or burglars. Andres Morales,15, thinks being on the blog is a chance to promote his real passion, being a pilot. ""Aviation is my life,"" Morales told CNN. In his RKOI Instagram photo, he is standing in front of a Quest Kodiak airplane, which typically costs about $1.7 million. It's not his, but he is checking it out ""for future interest."" Though only in the 10th grade, Morales has spent much of his life perusing aviation and flying, starting when he was eight. He is proud of his hobby -- he has 300 hours of flight experience and wants to be a commercial airline pilot when he's older. He's also proud of his lifestyle. ""Yes, my lifestyle is a jet-setter lifestyle,"" he said. ""I travel a lot and love to fly private and in first class."" Morales thinks the interest in the Rich Kids of Instagram blog is because ""people cant find anything else to do with their lives so they stalk other people's photos and make a big deal out of it."" Ierna speculates the blog has become popular because people are ""intrigued to see how the 1% lives."" He said he was amused with all the attention at first, but that it has become a headache. Ierna has family money -- both his father and grandfather were successful businessmen -- but he also has his own brand and career plans. He'd like to attend NYU and study business, eventually opening high-end nightclubs, restaurants and clothing boutiques around the globe. ""I think it accurately represents my lifestyle to some extent,"" said Ierna of his photos. ""For the most part I live a very normal life.""

"In the wake of criticism over a two-game suspension for Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, the NFL has established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Thursday. A second incident would be punished by a lifetime ban from the league, Goodell said in a letter and memo to the owners of the league's 32 teams. Without referring to Rice by name, he acknowledged in his letter that he made the wrong decision in that case. ""I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better. And we will,"" he wrote. The policy, which is effective immediately, also applies to other types of violence. ""Violations of the Personal Conduct Policy regarding assault, battery, domestic violence or sexual assault that involve physical force will be subject to a suspension without pay of six games for a first offense, with consideration given to mitigating factors, as well as a longer suspension when circumstances warrant."" Goodell said the circumstances that would warrant a longer suspension include incidents that predate a person's time with an NFL team or acts that involve choking, repeated blows or a weapon. They also include violence against a pregnant woman or in view of child. Lifetime bans may be appealed after a year. The players union issued a response. ""We were informed today of the NFL's decision to increase penalties on domestic violence offenders under the Personal Conduct Policy for all NFL employees. As we do in all disciplinary matters, if we believe that players' due process rights are infringed upon during the course of discipline, we will assert and defend our members' rights,"" the NFL Players Association said in its statement. Read the letter and memo . Rice was suspended for two games after video showed him dragging his unconscious fiancee -- whom he later married -- from an elevator. Rice resolved the charges stemming from the incident with his now-wife, Janay, and entered a pretrial intervention program in May, the NFL said. Under the program, he won't be prosecuted, and the charges will be expunged after a year, the league said. The punishments, both from the NFL and from the criminal justice system, were widely decried as too light, and the issue quickly spiraled into debates over domestic violence and victim-blaming. Opinion: NFL, apologize to women for Ray Rice . Goodell's letter tells teams to distribute a memo about the new policy to each player and all members of the organizations. The NFL's Personal Conduct Policy states that employees are ""held to a higher standard"" of conduct. ""Persons who fail to live up to this standard of conduct are guilty of conduct detrimental and subject to discipline, even where the conduct itself does not result in conviction of a crime,"" the policy states.

"Egyptian authorities have served Al Jazeera with a charge sheet that identifies eight of its staff on a list of 20 people -- all believed to be journalists -- for allegedly conspiring with a terrorist group, the network said Wednesday. The 20 are wanted by Egyptian authorities on charges of conspiring with a terror group and ""broadcasting false information and rumors to convince the international community that Egypt was undergoing a civil war,"" according to Egypt's state-run media. The eight Al Jazeera journalists include three -- Australian Peter Greste, and Eygptians Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy -- who have been held by authorities since December 29, the network said in a written statement. The charges against the journalists come amid a military crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood following the ouster of the country's first democratically-elected president, Mohamed Morsy. Egyptian authorities say the three jailed Al Jazeera journalists held illegal meetings with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was declared a terrorist group in December. Western leaders, human rights groups and journalists have repeatedly called on Egypt to release the men, saying their arrests were a violation of human rights and media freedoms. In the statement, the Qatar-based Al Jazeera said it ""has finally been officially served, allowing the network to comment on the case for the first time."" ""Eight network staff are on the list of twenty, meaning most of those named are not employees of Al Jazeera,"" it said. Al Jazeera English managing editor Al Anstey called for the charges to be dropped, saying the allegations were ""unjust and unacceptable."" ""Journalists exist to cover and challenge all sides of every story, so the idea we would broadcast 'false news' is not only totally wrong, it is also a challenge to journalism itself and the critical role journalism plays in informing people worldwide what is really going on,"" Anstey said in a statement released by Al Jazeera. Anstey stood by the network's coverage, saying all of its videos were available online. ""Everyone can clearly see they are accurate, comprehensive, balanced and underpinned with quality and integrity. The reports tell all sides of the complex story in Egypt,"" he said. In addition to Greste, British journalists Sue Turton and Dominic Kane and Dutch journalist Rena Netjes were named on the charge sheet, according to Al Jazeera. ""I am astounded that a warrant is out for my arrest because of my reporting in Egypt last year. I didn't treat the situation there any differently to every other story I've reported on in almost 25 years as a TV reporter,"" said Turton, who worked for Britain's SkyNews, ITN and Channel 4 before joining Al Jazeera. Kane, who worked for BBC before joining Al Jazeera, said they were doing a difficult job under ""trying circumstances."" ""I have always sought to cover the events I witness with impartiality and accuracy. I trust that all who watch my reports will see that,"" he said. Of the other Al Jazeera employees named, Al Jazeera identified them only as Egyptian producers and engineers working for the network in Doha, ""all of whom refute the charges against them,"" the statement said. It is not immediately clear who the remaining 14 people are.

"Google is knocking at your front door. It wants to come inside, make itself at home, and quietly turn all of your boring home devices into ""smart"" connected gadgets that learn about your patterns and preferences, talk to each other, collect data about your habits and make life easier by assisting with daily tasks. On Monday, Google announced it was buying smart-device company Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in cash. This is Google's first major foray into connected homes, and news of the deal ignited a flurry of speculation about what the Silicon Valley giant really wants from Nest, as well as some privacy concerns. Nest currently only sells two products: a smart thermostat that learns your habits over time and adjusts the temperature accordingly, and a personable smoke and carbon monoxide detector that doesn't panic when you burn toast. While the devices have been popular, on the surface they don't seem like they move enough units to be worth such a hefty investment, even at $130 to $250 each. It's what's behind the scenes and inside the gadgets that makes Nest a coveted get for Google. Nest makes impeccably designed hardware powered by clever algorithms. Its staff comes from major companies like Apple, Sling and Logitech and is experienced in machine learning, product design, artificial intelligence and robotics. Nest is a standout in the increasingly crowded connected-home market. It may only have two products, but those devices are considered some of the best in the field. For now, Nest is expected to continue operating as its own brand headed by co-founders Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, but down the line Google could tap the team's expertise to help with its own hit-and-miss attempts at creating and selling devices (remember the Nexus Q?). The Nest thermostat uses motion, light, temperature and humidity sensors to collect information about what's going on in the home and uses that information to control heating and cooling and predict patterns. The end result is a customized, more energy efficient home. Like any good smart device, it can be controlled from a smartphone or tablet so your house can be prewarmed before you get out of bed or return from work. ""It's amazing to see how they have taken important but unloved devices and made them beautifully simple and useful,"" said Google CEO Larry Page in a brief post announcing the deal. Aside from the financial windfall, there's a lot Nest could gain from having Google as its parent company. Nest has been slow with product releases so far. The first thermostat came out in the fall of 2011, and the company didn't release a new product for another two years, when it announced the Nest Protect smoke and CO detector. With Google resources, Nest can ramp up its design process and develop more projects. New products will come faster and roll out in more locations globally. Google also wants to be a player in the connected home. The trend of connecting previously ""dumb"" devices to each other and the Internet is sometimes referred to as the ""Internet of things."" As regular objects get connected, they gain the ability to collect information about mundane happenings around them. That data can be used to learn about a person over time and offer a customized, automated experience. At home, that can mean a refrigerator that knows what food is inside and when it expires, or security systems that send your smartphone a push notification when they detect anything unusual. Google has cultivated a diverse and seemingly random set of interests since starting out as a search engine and advertising company. It dabbles in e-mail, smartphones, self-driving cars, social networking, smart glasses, television and robots. Nest is the latest in a string of intriguing acquisitions, following a handful of robotics companies. In the near future, these interests may not seem so disconnected. Today's emerging technologies will eventually blend together. The divisions between smartphones, home automation, cars, smart glasses and watches and fitness trackers will fall away, and our gadgets and data will work together for a seamless experience. All of your devices will communicate with each other. Where one drops off another will pick up. Your self-driving car will share push notifications from your smartphone, turn it over to your Google Glass when you park and start walking, and then a smart home can take over when you walk through your front door. (Thanks to GPS on your phone and car, the house knew exactly when you were arriving and turned on your favorite TV show.) Streams of data from all these devices will be collected in one place where a company like Google will analyze it and learn about you over time, programming hardware and software to meet your unique needs. A few years from now, you might even connect your smart devices to your brain. Dean Aslam, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Michigan State University and a senior member of IEEE, is working on miniaturizing single electrode devices that can be placed in your hair and read electrical activity from the brain  through a technology called electroencephalography, or EEG. ""It can read the brainwaves which determine the state of our minds, like whether we're healthy or unhealthy. A lot of information can be obtained [from EEG],"" Aslam said. He says in the future, smart homes will pick up on cues from the body and brain to adjust things like temperature. It if detects you're in a deep REM sleep, a home might increase the level of security. The technology wouldn't be limited to smart homes and could expand to include personal heath care systems. If this is the future, it's no mystery why Google would want to get into the business now. Google owning another tool that would allow it to gather more data immediately triggered privacy concerns. Fresh off of an unpopular decision to allow Google+ contacts to contact people in their circles through Gmail, Google already has users who are unsettled by the vast amounts of data the company can collect. Google has access to a person's data through the Chrome browser, Gmail accounts, Google search terms and the many advanced sensors on an Android smartphone. That wide reach is actually a good reason not to worry about a smart thermostat. Google can collect most of the same information through an Android phone. It already knows your location and your daily schedule. Samsung's Galaxy S4 Android smartphone even has a built-in temperature sensor. Google has access to much of your data. Now it wants to put it to use connecting your home, work and mobile life.","Google is purchasing smart-thermostat company Nest for $3.2 billion in cash .

"In defiance of Newton's law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, any discussion of legitimate controls on the use, handling and sale of firearms routinely yields an explosive overreaction of opposition. I learned that firsthand when I organized a voluntary gun buyback program for January 8 in Tucson, Arizona. It was the tipping point for me to change my party affiliation from Republican to Democratic. On January 8 in 2011, a seriously deranged young man murdered six people, including a 9-year-old girl, and wounded 13, including Rep. Gabby Giffords, during a 45-second shooting rampage in Tucson. He was finally subdued when he stopped to change clips in his semiautomatic weapon, after firing 31 rounds. In the immediate aftermath, our community came together as one in our grieving over the deaths and in our resolve to do what we could to prevent a repeat of the tragedy. But the irrational fears of the gun lobby succeeded in shouting down the debate, and in the intervening two years not a single piece of meaningful legislation has been adopted that would even begin to solve the problem. I was the target of some of that violent overreaction in the two weeks leading up to the buyback. Thinly veiled threats were leveled at me.  I was referred to as ""Hitler."" The response made it clear the event I was planning hit a nerve among a group who evidently believe the proper disposal of a firearm is tantamount to the desecration of a holy icon. Opinion: A father's murder, a plea on gun control . Guns are not fetish objects. The buyback was simply an offer to people who were uncomfortable with having a weapon in their homes to trade those weapons into the Tucson Police Department in exchange for a $50 grocery gift card. More than $10,000 in gift cards were distributed during the event. The money I used to buy those cards was donated in just under two weeks by Tucson residents, who still cling to the hope we will re-engage on the topic of rational gun control. They showed that the loud voices are not going to shout down the discussion this time around. But on the periphery of my buyback, and on the periphery of rational discourse, was a group of gun and NRA enthusiasts holding a ""cash for guns"" firearms flea market. They held it on the boundary of the police department parking lot in which my buyback was taking place. Obama's gun violence measures: Would they work? In Arizona, it is legal for a person to walk up to another on a street corner, hand him cash for a firearm and simply walk off with it, with no need for a background check into his psychological or criminal history. That was exactly what happened with those who came to my buyback to ""score some deals"" on weapons by outbidding the gift cards I was offering. I was a Republican at the time, but less than one week after the buyback, I chose to switch parties. I believe there is a centrist element among the rank and file in the GOP, but the leadership is led by the far right and openly beholden to the NRA and the gun lobby. It is that rigid ideology that is driving the party into irrelevancy. The overreaction to the gun buyback made it clear that, in Tucson at least, the Republican Party  is out of touch with the values of the community. The cash for guns event clearly highlighted that anyone, a criminal or someone who is mentally ill, can immediately buy a gun with no questions asked in Tucson. It's obvious that public safety demands that background checks be incorporated somehow in private, person-to-person purchases of guns. Newspaper removes online data of gun permits . That really is low-hanging fruit in the regulation of weapons sales. Legislators have got to stand up to the gun lobbyists who resist even this minimal change in the law and adopt it --  federally and immediately. Consider if the Tucson shooter had needed to change clips after just five rounds had been fired, or even 10. The carnage of the day would have been significantly decreased. Lives would have been saved. The size of gun magazines is also low-hanging fruit in this conversation. So is the need to stop selling armor-piercing ammunition on the open market. Unless the goal is to kill a police officer, certainly rational people can agree that restrictions on the manufacture and sale of this sort of ammunition is in order. NRA draws heat over shooting game . Over the past three years, the Arizona Legislature, with a Republican supermajority, has adopted statutes that have been offensive to Latinos, women and youth.  I have openly resisted those bills, and after the recent elections in which those three demographic groups rejected the Republican brand, I had hoped things would change, and that the party leadership would resist the continuing lurch to the far right. But even after 20 schoolchildren were killed in Newtown, leaders of the GOP have shown no inclination to resist the gun lobbyists who fund campaigns, but who come empty-handed when asked to craft reasonable gun legislation. Until the Republican Party hemorrhages more and more centrists, leaders will not wake up to the damage they're doing to themselves and the party. The  debate over rational gun control legislation is an opportunity for them to engage in a productive manner to make this nation safer.","Steve Kozachik organized a gun buyback in Tucson, the city where Gabby Giffords was shot .

"(CNN) -- Over the course of two June nights, attackers plundered villages in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. They stole medicine from the local health center, goats from farmers, cell phones, motorcycles and other property from residents. Before fleeing, they raped and beat more than 170 women. The women were as young as 17, as old as 90, according to a United Nations official, who was not named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The attacks took place in the villages of Nakyele and Abala. The humanitarian group Medicins San Frontieres reported Thursday that its medical teams in the Fizi area of Sud Kivu province had treated about 100 women for rape, abuse and trauma. It was the latest in many such incidents that have earned Congo the ignominious title of ""rape capital"" of the world. Martin Nesirky, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said the global body has received ""several worrying reports about incidents of an unknown number of alleged rapes and looting."" The United Nations mission in Congo dispatched peacekeepers to Fizi to investigate the incident. Fizi is eight hours by foot from the nearest U.N. base and, like other towns and villages in Congo, is difficult to access because of harsh terrain and a lack of infrastructure. ""People are in total despair,"" Jean Marie Ngoma, a member of the provincial parliament, said on U.N.-backed Radio Okapi. Amnesty International said the latest rapes were a result of the government's ""horrific failure of justice."" It said members of the same armed group were previously implicated in rapes in the same area in January. Amnesty cited local sources saying that a senior officer of the Congolese army, Col. Kifaru Niragiye, had recently learned that he was to be demoted and left a military training center June 9 with 150 soldiers. Amnesty said the group went on to raid the two villages near Fizi. Kifaru's deputy and eight other men were convicted by a military court for crimes against humanity for the rape of at least 60 women in the January attack in Fizi, Amnesty said. ""The inability of the Democratic Republic of Congo to bring to justice members of its own army and armed groups for crimes under international law has fostered a culture of impunity, leading to attack after attack against civilians,"" said Erwin van der Borght, Amnesty International's director for Africa. A five-year war in which more than 5 million people died ended in 2003, but violence is still widespread in eastern Congo. Sexual violence is especially prevalent, prompting Margot Wallstrom, the U.N. special representative on sexual violence in conflict, to call Congo the rape capital of the world. An extensive study conducted between 2006 and 2007 found that more than 400,000 girls and women were raped during a 12-month period. The United Nations documented 7,500 cases of sexual violence against women and girls in North and South Kivu over the first nine months of 2009. The fear was that many rapes had gone unreported. ""Most of the women and girls were gang-raped, some so violently that they later died,"" according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which said both the army and the rebels held women and girls as sex slaves, raped them repeatedly, and then mutilated and killed some of them. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Azadeh Ansari and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","About 100 women near the town of Fizi treated for rape, abuse and trauma .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge ruled in favor of NFL players on Monday, issuing an injunction that ordered the league's owners to lift their lockout. However, Greg Aiello, NFL senior vice president of public relations, said the league will seek an immediate stay of the ruling pending an appeal. A lockout was imposed after talks between the players and owners broke down last month and the players disbanded their union. An NFL statement said an appeal will be on the grounds that federal law prohibits injunctions in labor disputes. Your guide to the NFL talks . In her ruling Monday, U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson said the decision by the players to disband their union meant the case no longer came under federal labor law that prohibits injunctions, as claimed by the owners. Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, and seven other players filed the lawsuit on behalf of other current and eligible NFL players against the league to halt the lockout, which could affect the start of the 2011-12 season scheduled for September 8. The players also want a future trial to determine if the NFL lockout is in violation of federal antitrust laws. If the players are locked out from playing in September, it would be the first NFL work stoppage since 1987, with months of labor and legal maneuvering looming for football fans already confused about how a $9 billion industry lacks enough money to satisfy everyone. The heart of the issue between the players and the owners is how to divide the league's $9 billion in revenue. Right now, NFL owners take $1 billion off the top of that revenue stream. After that, the players get about 60%. The owners say that the current labor deal doesn't take into account the rising costs related to building stadiums and promoting the game. The players argue that the league has not sufficiently opened up its books to prove this. In addition, the owners also want to increase the season by two games, which the players are against because of the risk of injuries. NFL's dirty secret: Players suffer . While star players earn millions of dollars each year, the median NFL salary is $790,000 and the average career lasts about four years. A lockout also impacts the league's employees: the receptionists, ticket salespeople, and stadium workers. The New York Jets have announced that they will require all business-side employees to take a one-week unpaid leave each month during any lockout. The lockout will not stop the NFL draft, which will proceed as scheduled on April 28-30, the league said.","The NFL says it will file an immediate appeal .

"Another common household object is getting ""smart"" and hopping online. This time it's your smoke detector. Nest is releasing a new smoke and carbon monoxide detector called Nest Protect that will send a message to your mobile device when the alarm is triggered or when the battery is low, so you can be alerted to an emergency at home even while you are away. In addition to the usual loud beeping alarm sound, the Nest Protect has added a recording of a human voice that will describe the problem. This is the first entirely new product tche Silicon Valley company has introduced since its flagship Nest thermostat. Nest was started by ex-Apple designer Tony Fadell in 2010. Fadell said he was looking for a better way to make his Tahoe home more energy efficient. The Nest thermostat learns your patterns over time and automatically controls a home's heating and cooling systems for maximum efficiency. Old thermostats were wasteful, but what did Nest think was wrong with the traditional smoke and carbon monoxide detectors? Annoyance seemed to be first on the list. When the battery is low in a smoke alarm, the small white discs emit a low beep until the battery is replaced. Annoyance can be a safety issue. When a sensitive alarm is set off by everyday occurrences like burnt waffles, some people remove the batteries from their alarm to shut it up and are left unprotected. Nest Protect eases you into an emergency instead of immediately blaring every time kitchen experiment goes awry. When it first detects smoke or carbon monoxide, the device will turn yellow and the human voice will say where the smoke or carbon monoxide levels are high. Since most alarms are affixed to the ceiling, getting to them to turn off an alarm requires a tall person or a chair. Nest has added a sensor that lets you wave at the device to reset it or to get more information about an alarm. One of the selling points of smart objects is that they can talk to each other. The Nest Protect can connect with the Nest Thermostat so that when carbon monoxide is detected, the thermostat can power down the gas furnace to be safe. It also connects with other Nest Protect devices and can communicate which location is detecting a problem. This is not the first connected smoke alarm. Some existing ""smart home"" systems already include support for traditional fire and carbon monoxide alarms. You can connect a smoke alarm to a system like Smartthings or Lowe's Iris and set it up so that you get a text, phone call or e-mail notification on a phone or tablet when an alarm goes off. Those alarms are just connected versions of traditional devices and do not have features like human voices or wave controls. Connected home devices are a growing market, and most systems are focused on creating vast networks of inexpensive connected objects, like front door locks, motion sensors, power switches and thermostats. Nest's approach is different.

"(CNN)Catapulted into the international spotlight after the publication of a sensational biography in 2012, Shin Dong-hyuk became the most famous North Korean defector. A soft-spoken and shy man, Shin shared his harrowing story about escaping from a total control zone called Camp 14, giving Western audiences an accessible reading on North Korea. Over the weekend, Shin stated that parts of his stories are inaccurate, although he did not specify which aspects. He posted on Facebook that parts of his past ""that I so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden."" Blaine Harden, author of ""Escape From Camp 14,"" wrote on his website that Shin had admitted several inaccuracies, including the length of time he spent in Camp 14. For more: North Korean prison camp survivor admits inaccuracies . Shin's high-profile role and now admitted inconsistencies in his story raised concerns that it could undermine human rights advocacy efforts and distract from testimonies by other North Korean refugees. ""There are a lot of people who actually have been to the (prison) camp and experienced it. It will be wrong for their witness accounts to lose credibility because of this incident,"" said Ahn Myeong Chul, a former North Korean camp guard who knows Shin. Peter Jung, director of the human rights group Justice for North Korea, said he's ""worried that people testifying about North Korea will be called a liar"" but that Shin's new revelations can't challenge the fact that ""North Korea control camps exist."" Jung said that many North Korean refugees, such as Shin, suffer from major trauma after escaping the regime and called for support. ""I hope he gathers his courage and tells his story accurately and honestly, and we must help him do that."" Scrutiny on North Korea's human rights abuses . North Korean memoirs and testimonies cannot be verified -- there are no paper trails and investigators cannot interview or access witnesses in a closed society. Their stories are compared for consistency with other defectors and experts, but the process is far from foolproof. CNN has not been able to reach Shin, who noted in his social media apology that ""these will be my final words and this will likely be my final post."" Shin's admission of inaccuracies comes at a time of unparalleled attention on North Korea's human rights record following a landmark U.N. Commission of Inquiry report listing abuses of the Pyongyang regime. While ""Escape From Camp 14"" was not the sole reason for the creation of the commission, Navi Pillay, then the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, urged the probe after meeting Shin and another North Korean prison camp survivor in December 2012. Since the commission report's release in 2014, the U.N. General Assembly has called for more sanctions and a referral of those responsible to the International Criminal Court. The matter remains at the U.N. Security Council, where it's likely China would block referrals of Kim Jong Un and his leadership to the International Criminal Court. Double horror or triple horror? Michael Kirby, chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into North Korea, said that Shin's testimony consisted of only two paragraphs in the 400-page report and that he was only one of hundreds of North Korean witnesses. ""It's a very small part of a very long story. And it really doesn't affect the credibility of the testimony, which is online,"" he said. ""Lots of people took part (in) this inquiry. Their stories are powerful and convincing, and these stories do not only represent Shin but other people in North Korea."" In a reversal of his story told for years, Shin told Harden on Friday that he had been transferred to another prison, Camp 18, when he was 6, instead of spending his entire life inside North Korea at the total control zone Camp 14, the author says on his website. The distinction of whether Shin was imprisoned in Camp 14 or 18 was not a deal breaker for Kirby. ""It seems as if the issue is whether he was in the total control zone, or whether he was in an ordinary prison camp. In another words, it's whether triple horror or double horror,"" Kirby said. Pressures . Shin bears the physical scars of torture, including a missing fingertip and burn marks on his back, according to the book. And Harden noted in his book that during the interview process, Shin at times was unreliable and ""in many crucial instances, corrected his Korean memoir"" -- an autobiography that Shin wrote in 2007, called ""Escape to the Outside World,"" which was only published in Korean. North Korea had sought to discredit Shin. Last fall, a pro-North Korea government website released videos with English subtitles featuring a man whom Shin recognized to be his father, disputing the story that his son was ever in a prison camp. Shin responded with a statement, accusing the government of ""holding my father hostage."" It's unclear if the video had any bearing on the timing of Shin's admission. Ahn, the former prison camp guard who has known Shin for seven years, said he believes the crux of Shin's story is true and that torture in either camp is still the same. ""Shin became an icon for North Korean human rights. Whether he was in Camp 14 or Camp 18, he is definitely a person from a political prison camp. He was born there and tortured there."" CNN's Judy Kwon and KJ Kwon contributed to this report.","Shin Dong-hyuk, subject of best-selling book, admits part of his stories are inaccurate .
Advocates say it doesn't matter which North Korean prison camp Shin was in .
Some fear Shin's admission of inaccuracies will affect views of other defectors' testimonies ."
"The grave is in a cemetery on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, marked only by a number. The families haven't yet added the names of the two young men who were recently buried there together. Paulo Pinheiro da Silva, 21, and Luan da Silva, 18, (no relation) and two others, also teenagers, were shot to death by police in September. According to police, the four were killed in a shootout after being chased for more than 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) in a stolen car. Authorities haven't provided further details. Family and friends say the youths were last seen at a party in the poor suburb where they grew up. Some witnesses say they saw police detain them when they went for a walk outside. The next day, their desperate families learned they could find them in the morgue. Tereza Pinheiro still keeps her son Paulo's clothes neatly folded in the bedroom the whole family shares. ""I lost my son, I lost my son,"" she sobs. ""All I know is the police were involved. They say there was a shootout, but where was the exchange of fire? The bullets were all going in one direction."" The four young men died in September, and their families still haven't received forensic reports. But at the funerals friends and relatives say they started to receive anonymous messages on their cell phones with gruesome photos of the crime scene and also of cadavers riddled with holes. Luan's brother, Alan da Silva, says he thinks these were messages from the police. ""The police were the only ones in a position to take those pictures,"" he says. ""They wanted to intimidate us, intimidate the community and say, 'We're not fooling around.' "" The families say they believe the killings all point to torture. In the photos, CNN counted 13 bullet wounds on Luan's body, some forming a ring around his neck, and what looked like a smiley face carved into his chest. Relatives say some of the teeth were also pulled out at the root. ""I don't know why they did it,"" says Luan's mother, Antonia Maria Miguel. ""They were killed like animals."" But her eldest son, Alan, says police brutality is not uncommon in Brazil's poor shantytowns and suburbs. ""It doesn't matter if you're white, black, blue or gray. If you were born in poverty, you were born guilty,"" he says. The Sao Paulo public defender's office agrees. ""It's a serious case itself, but it's also representative of what happens in Brazil,"" Public Defender Samuel Friedman tells CNN. This month his office sent an urgent appeal to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to investigate the case. Friedman says that ""at the very least that the police used force illegally, but it also points that (the young men) might have been executed. It is likely they have been executed."" State officials have declined interview requests but say they are investigating. Brazilian police killed more than 11,000 civilians from 2009 to 2013, according to a recent report by the Forum on Public Safety, a group that collects and disseminates government safety data. The report concludes there is an ""abusive use of lethal force"" in Brazil. By comparison, the reports says, police in the United States killed roughly the same number of people over 30 years -- from 1983 to 2012. Alan da Silva says he hopes the United Nations will intervene and find out what really happened to his brother. And also step up pressure so that nothing like it happens to the baby son he left behind.","Police say four young men were killed in a shootout after a chase in a stolen car in September .

"(CNN)In just two years, Bonita went from full-time work to a part of the new underclass of unemployed. The longer it's been since she was forced to leave her job with the Boston Housing Authority, the harder it gets to return to the ranks of the employed. Even though the 46-year-old mother of five has an accounting certificate and a mind for numbers, prospective employers ""don't so much as look at me because of my age or because of my work gap,"" she says, referring to the period of time she's been unemployed. ""It's always like, 'OK, thank you, we'll call you within two weeks.' Then three weeks go by. And when you call them, they say, 'Oh, didn't you get a letter? We've found a more suitable candidate.'"" Two years after his release from prison, Travis was still struggling to find full-time, stable employment. He put out applications, but his phone didn't ring. The odd jobs, like cleaning cooking equipment for restaurants, helped, but after months of relying on his family for support with little to contribute in return, he felt like a bum. ""I wanted to be one of the people who get up and go to work every day without breaking the law and have a quality of life,"" he told Monica Potts in a story she wrote for the American Prospect. Yet with no other options in sight, he turned for a time to what he knew to be a reliable source of income -- selling drugs in his West Baltimore neighborhood—before finding help. The stories of Bonita and Travis stories aren't outliers -- more and more Americans are finding themselves relegated to the margins of the economy, despite their best efforts to escape that fate. It breeds hardship and hopelessness, and it also violates a basic tenet of our social contract when temporary setbacks become permanent obstacles. The numbers reflect the extent of that permanence; the longer you've been out of work, the harder it is to find it again. That's a troubling reality because for most Americans, the path to success isn't straightforward; it's punctuated with obstacles and pitfalls. To the immigrant in search of a fresh start, the entrepreneur in pursuit of a new business venture, or the countless families striving for a better tomorrow, it's the promise of a second chance that animates the American Dream. Many of the Sooners, forty-niners and other pioneers who built our country were running from failures back east. On Tuesday, President Obama will give his State of the Union address. One key issue he should address is the problem of long-term unemployment. While the unemployment rate has improved, there are many Americans who have fallen off the radar. To restore an economy capable of reaching its potential and renew our claim to be a nation that encourages its citizens to pursue their aspirations, we have to stop defining people by their failures. We need to rebuild the ""second-chance"" economy. As Bonita found out, in today's economy being unemployed now often makes you unemployable. One-third of the 10.5 million people who are currently jobless qualify as ""long-term unemployed,"" meaning they have been out of work for longer than six months. And in most parts of the country, discrimination against them is perfectly legal: just take a look at the map below. With three unemployed workers for every job opening, employers can be selective. In startling research, Rand Ghayad, a labor economist at Northeastern University, found that prospective employers consistently threw out resumes of applicants with a recent stint of unemployment in favor of applicants with consistent work histories -- even applicants with less education or no relevant work experience. It should be unsurprising, then, that Brookings estimates that in any given month, only 11% of the long-term unemployed will have attained steady, full-time employment a year later. And being consigned to the ""long-term unemployed"" category is more likely to result from bad timing than lack of talent. The single-greatest factor determining whether someone will bear the mark of ""long-term unemployed"" is what the unemployment rate was when he lost his job. Workers may invest years in their education and acquiring the skills that make them successful at their jobs -- only to be rejected because of factors beyond their control. Not only can this create a scarring effect that can permanently diminish their earning potential, it also results in a tremendous loss of human capital at a time when the economy is still struggling to recover. While discrimination against the long-term unemployed is permissible under the law, for individuals with a criminal conviction, it's often mandatory. A groundbreaking report by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers recently documented over 45,000 legal barriers faced by those with a criminal record  -- in employment, housing, student financial aid, access to a business license or a driver's license, or even the right to vote. Though targeted restrictions in the interest of public safety are needed, many others -- such as New York state's prohibition against employment as a bingo caller -- are simply arbitrary and punitive. The impact of these barriers is massive and disproportionately affects communities of color (that's partly because, as you can see below, communities of color have a much higher chance of going to prison than their white counterparts). Since 1980, the number of incarcerated Americans has more than tripled -- reaching the highest rate in the world -- and one out of every 34 Americans is either behind bars, on probation, or on parole, many for non-violent drug offenses. The striking breakdown between the types of crimes is below. In all, according to the National Employment Law Project, at least 65 million Americans, totaling more than one in four adults, have a criminal record, that subjects them to these mandatory ""collateral consequences"" (such as being unable to get a driver's license or to qualify for student financial assistance) on top of their formal sentence. These policies keep ex-offenders on the outside of their families and communities, as well as of the economy and democracy. And, in the era of big data, the past doesn't stay there. Instead, past missteps and misfortunes will linger in permanent and public view. With the click of a button, information from employment histories and civil and criminal records to credit reports and foreclosures can be summoned and used to deny access to employment, housing, or the public assistance needed just to put food on the table. This data -- often full of inaccuracies -- will leave scars on millions of people, in many cases inflicted by automated processes that another human being never touches. What can be done? To start delivering on the promise of a second-chance economy, policy efforts must focus on four key principles: . -- Employers must stop discriminating against applicants without a job . That means removing employment status as a requirement in job postings and making sure human resources representatives aren't discarding the resumes of unemployed applicants on sight. Some states have passed laws prohibiting  discrimination against the unemployed. And in December 2013, a House bill was introduced that offered tax incentives to employers of the long-term unemployed. Though the bill was ultimately unsuccessful, laws alone aren't the answer because they're so difficult to enforce and monitor. Beyond legislation, the government could fund programs that build partnerships between corporations, local community colleges or workforce development organizations to align training of the currently unemployed with the jobs most needed within the company. It could also prioritize the long term unemployed in its own hiring practices. -- Entering the criminal justice system shouldn't be a one-way street out of the economy . Through ""ban the box"" laws (in other words, prohibiting the use of boxes applicants must check to indicate they're unemployed), states and cities across the country are already limiting the impact of past incarceration on employment prospects. States could strengthen these efforts by both reducing first-time incarceration and taking a more holistic approach to reentry that connects ex-offenders with the basic tools they need to get jobs and manage money. For starters, states should provide each individual leaving a correctional facility with a state-issued ID—a prerequisite to employment, opening a bank account, and accessing a range of other services and opportunities. -- Give people who have encountered adversity the financial tools they need to start over . Everyone needs a safe, affordable place to store and transfer money. New York is working with major financial service providers to remove barriers to bank accounts imposed by ChexSystems, a database that banks use to estimate risk posed by potential customers. The city's Department of Consumer Affairs estimates that this and similar databases have prevented more than 825,000 residents in New York City alone from opening an account, often as a result of isolated mistakes, like overdrafts, rather than the fraud it was intended to detect. -- Big Data shouldn't be a tool for economic exclusion . In an era of increasingly automated decision-making, we need to both ensure the privacy of those interacting with data systems, and strengthen the integrity of those systems. We can start by following this set of guidelines laid out by a high-profile coalition of civil rights groups. Among them -- give individuals control over how a corporation can gather data from them; allow people to ensure that the data used to make decisions about them is accurate. We've all heard about the ""right to be forgotten"" ruling in Europe. Although it raises important concerns about the freedom of information, the response to that ruling shows that all of us -- and particularly those with blemishes on their record -- need a chance to make a fresh start. These are just a few examples of how we can begin to replace our policies and practices that double down on disadvantage with ones that restore second chances. A real second-chance economy will not only benefit those who are shut out of economic citizenship, but will also restore the dynamism and growth to our economy that will create jobs for everyone who wants to work.","In President Obama's State of the Union address, he should look at solutions for the jobless .
The longer people have been out of work, the harder it is to find a job .
We must have policy that stops discrimination against the long-term unemployed ."
"(CNN) -- A man shot up a federal courthouse and a Mexican consulate -- which he also seemingly tried to set ablaze -- in Austin, Texas, early Friday before being shot dead outside police headquarters, that city's police chief said. The shooter fired ""over 100 rounds"" in a roughly 10-minute span, but he did not hit anyone even though the bullets ricocheted at a typically busy time in downtown Austin, when streets fill with people after bars close for the night. ""This Thanksgiving ... weekend, I give thanks that no one but the suspect is injured or deceased,"" police Chief Art Acevedo said. ""That's something that we should all take a lot of comfort in."" The shooter was identified in a tweet from Austin police as 49-year-old Larry McQuilliam . Acevedo said he was an Austin resident who had a criminal history. Authorities have not offered a motive, but the police chief said that the shooter's ""violent anti-government behavior"" -- as evidenced by attacking buildings that belong to Mexico's government, the U.S. government and, in the police headquarters, the city government -- may have come from ongoing and often vitriolic debates in society. ""Our political discourse has become very heated and sometimes very angry, and sometimes the rhetoric is not healthy,"" Acevedo said, adding that the divisive immigration debate ""comes to mind,"" given that the federal courthouse and Mexican Consulate were targeted. ""I would venture, based on my training and experience, that the political rhetoric might have fed into some of this."" The first 911 calls about gunshots came in at 2:22 a.m. Friday, with some reporting a ""possible automatic weapon being fired"" a few minutes later. Very soon after that, police started to hear about gunfire near a recently opened federal courthouse and then at the city's nearby Mexican Consulate. Acevedo later said the suspect -- using small cylinders often used for camping -- is thought to have ignited a fire at the consulate, though those flames were extinguished before any extensive damage was done. The police headquarters ""came under attack"" about 2:32 a.m., Acevedo said, at which time a sergeant with the department's mounted police unit happened to be outside, putting away horses. ""As he held two horses with one hand, he discharged ... at least one round with a single-handed shot,"" the chief said. ""That would have been one heck of a shot. So part of our investigation will be whether the suspect died from our gunshot, from a self-inflicted gunshot or from a combination of both."" After the gunman went down, officers spotted ""suspicious cylinders"" inside his van. And when they dragged the gunman away, officers noticed ""some type of vest on the suspect"" -- something that Acevedo said could have been ""simply a protective vest or potentially an IED suicide-type vest that is known to be used around the world."" Authorities immediately called in the bomb squad and closed off the surrounding area, including for a time stopping all traffic on a stretch of Interstate 35. A few hours later, they determined there were no explosives at the site. The suspect's residence ""has been secured and is safe,"" according to Acevedo's twitter account. Acevedo said that investigators, including FBI agents, ""will be looking at everything,"" even social media accounts, to try to determine what the gunman was thinking. The chief also said that he hopes the incident -- coming at a time of much-publicized, deep-seated anger at police after a Missouri grand jury's decision not to charge a Ferguson police officer in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown -- prompts people to think about the dangers that police face, and overcome, every day to keep residents safe. ""We are under siege at times,"" Acevedo said. ""And it's important for people to realize that the men and women in this profession are (the public's defense) when it comes to ... any type of threat, from terrorists or the common criminal."" CNN's Tina Burnside and Joshua Berlinger contributed to this report.","NEW: Police have identified the deceased as 49-year-old Larry McQuilliams .

"(CNN) -- Police officers do heroic, often frightening work. And they do it for our sake -- to protect us. So, first of all, thank you. But the fact is that police in the United States are killing far too many people. That has to change. In the aftermath of Michael Brown's killing in Ferguson, there has been much discussion about race relations, the justice system, gun ownership and other factors that may have played a role in the incident. But the most urgent issue, the one that demands the most immediate attention, is the frequency with which police in this country shoot suspects, guilty or not. The difference in the number of killings in the U.S. and the rest of the world is startling. While police in other major countries typically kill a few people every year, the numbers here are enormous. (More on that in a moment.) In the U.S., hundreds of people are killed by law enforcement every year. A large percentage of them are mentally ill. And although all ethnic groups have become victims, minorities are getting shot in numbers much greater than their proportion in the population. How many people are shot by police every year? Nobody seems to know the exact number (something that is itself disturbing -- no official government agency tracks the full data for the entire country). The FBI, compiling voluntarily submitted data from 750 out of 17,000 law enforcement agencies, reports about 400 ""justifiable homicides"" by police each year. That figure, of course, is incomplete and does not include killings deemed ""unjustifiable,"" or shootings that do not result in death. Police officers are not necessarily guilty of misconduct when someone is killed. In most cases, they are following training and protocol when they shoot. But unless you believe that it is acceptable for police to kill hundreds every year -- people who still deserve due process even if they are guilty -- there is surely a need to review and revise those protocols. Of course, there are situations in which police have no choice but to shoot to kill -- where members of the public or officers themselves are in imminent danger. But it should only happen when there is no other reasonable way to save the officer's life or other people's lives. In other cases, shooting to incapacitate -- or not shooting at all -- may be a better option. Unfortunately there are far too many cases where our consciences have been shocked. Take the case of a man widely reported to have had mental health issues, who was shot and killed not far from Ferguson after allegedly stealing a doughnut and a couple of energy drinks just two weeks after Michael Brown's death. He asked police ""Shoot me! Shoot me!"" What he likely needed was medical care. Many will have seen the images of a 12-year-old boy who was shot last month in Cleveland after someone called police saying he was pointing a gun at people. The caller reportedly added that the gun was probably fake. It was indeed a toy, but the boy is dead. There has to be a better way. Official nationwide statistics don't exist for the number of people who have been killed who were suffering from a mental illness, but my own analysis of 2,800 entries compiled by the private Fatal Encounters project suggests that almost 500 of those killed were mentally ill. Of those killed by law enforcement officials, 853 were white, 673 African-American, 305 Hispanic, 4 Middle Eastern. Many remain uncategorized, so the breakdowns are inexact, but the numbers are telling. Regardless of ethnicity, every one of these people, guilty of a crime or not, died without a trial. Some experts say police should aim not for the legs or arms but for the torso, the largest target in the body, which improves the odds of stopping an assailant. But the sheer number of deaths of unarmed suspects, or knife-wielding individuals who were not within reach of the officer, surely demands a rethink of the policy. In many cases, shooting to incapacitate would be sufficient and at least worth trying. Of course, a split-second decision is difficult in the heat of the moment. That's why thorough training is indispensable. On average, at least one person is killed by a cop every day in the U.S. In contrast, not a single one was killed in Britain last year, where police fired their guns a grand total of three times, according to The Economist. In 2011, when the FBI reported 404 justifiable law enforcement homicides in the U.S., police killed six people in Australia, two in England, six in Germany. It goes without saying that no two countries are exactly the same, and the U.S. has its own specific characteristics, and many of the factors raised in the wake of the Ferguson case are valid and deserving of attention. But in addition to the obvious costs in human lives and the weakening of trust in police and the legal system, the killings must surely be taking a toll on police officers. One can only imagine the emotional burden of having shot a civilian. Cops have incredibly stressful jobs, particularly in the U.S., where guns abound and thousands of people are shot to death every year. Last year, 30 police officers were killed. We should therefore consider ourselves in the debt, not only of the brave men and women who are putting their lives on the line, but their families as well. So we should not see it as putting cops on trial when we review the system as a whole. But it is also in the interests of officers themselves that we engage in a systemic quest for solutions. The first step in this process should be to start keeping proper and comparable statistics, which would allow us see where the problem is most severe, how the numbers are trending, and where police departments are doing a particularly good job, so that they might share best practice. This would make it easier to review procedures and protocols. Ultimately, our law enforcement officers should only kill people when there is no other alternative. Yes, in the heat of the moment mistakes will sometimes be made. But the scale of what is happening now is unacceptable.","Frida Ghitis: Police in United States are killing far too many people .

"New York (CNN) -- Protesters poured onto the streets of New York late Wednesday, upset over a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the death of Eric Garner. They marched at the same time U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that federal officials were moving ahead with a civil rights investigation. Garner, an unarmed black man, died in July after a white officer, Daniel Pantaleo, put him in a chokehold. Garner's death was later ruled a homicide. ""This fight ain't over. It just begun. I'm determined to get justice for my husband because he shouldn't have been killed in that way. He shouldn't have been killed in any way,"" said Esaw Garner, his widow. ""He should be here, celebrating Christmas and Thanksgiving and everything else, with his children and his grandchildren. And he can't. Why? Because a cop did wrong. Somebody that gets paid to do right did wrong and he's not held accountable for it. But my husband's death will not be in vain. As long as I have a breath in my body I will fight the fight till the end."" Protesters gathered at various points in Manhattan, including Times Square and Union Square, marching peacefully north as crowds formed near Rockefeller Center for the lighting of the Christmas tree. Columbus Circle was blocked for a time. There were demonstrations in other cities too, including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Oakland, California. ""No Justice. No peace,"" protesters chanted in New York. ""No racist police."" Garner's mother, who spoke alongside his widow, said she was disappointed by the grand jury's decision. She called for calm. ""We want you to rally, but rally in peace. Make a statement, but make it in peace,"" said Gwen Carr. On New York City's West Side Highway, a group of protesters stood face to face with rows of police officers, shouting, ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe."" The protesters sat down on the road, crying out, ""What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now!"" ""Ferguson is Everywhere,"" one demonstrator's sign read, referring to the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. 'I can't breathe' During the fatal encounter July 17 on Staten Island, Garner raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him. Seconds later, a video shows an officer behind Garner grab him in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. The New York City Police Department prohibits chokeholds. ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" Garner said repeatedly, his cries muffled into the pavement. Garner, 43, was pronounced dead that day. Police had suspected Garner of selling cigarettes illegally. The grand jury was made up of 14 white and nine nonwhite members, according to law enforcement sources. A total of 12 jurors who have heard all the evidence must be in agreement for a decision. The grand jury found that there was no ""reasonable cause"" to indict. The case became emblematic of longstanding tensions between police and minority communities, especially given that the majority of people stopped under the former ""stop-and-frisk"" police policy were African-American or Hispanic. A federal court ruled that stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional and tantamount to racial profiling. The Garner death led to demonstrations around the city and came weeks before the racially charged police shooting of Brown, who was unarmed, in Ferguson. 'National moment of grief"" President Barack Obama said the Garner case reflected a longtime ""concern on the part of too many minority communities that law enforcement is not working with them, and dealing with them in a fair way."" ""We are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust, and a strengthening of the accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement,"" he said. Standing outside the Staten Island store where his son was put into a fatal chokehold, Garner's father, Ben, told a crowd that he was hopeful about the federal investigation and urged demonstrators to remain peaceful. ""We want justice for Eric,"" he said. ""We ain't tearing up nothing. We ain't burning up nothing... The police is our problem. No violence. That is all I ask."" Mayor Bill de Blasio sought to allay tensions, saying that he had received assurances from Washington that the federal investigation of Garner's death would move forward ""expeditiously and with a clear sense of independence."" De Blasio said the grand jury decision has created ""a national moment of pain, a national moment of grief and searching for a solution."" Pantaleo, according to a statement from his union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said: ""I became a police officer to help people and to protect those who can't protect themselves. It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner. My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss."" Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan Jr. said the grand jury conducted dozens of interviews with witnesses, including 22 civilians, and met between September 29 and December 3. An attorney for Pantaleo said his client testified for approximately two hours on November 21 in front of the grand jury. U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens, called the decision ""a miscarriage of justice"" an ""outrage"" and a ""disgrace."" ""He was killed in plain sight for all of America to see because this was captured on video. And so it's inexplicable that this grand jury could not return a single charge,"" said Jeffries. Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said, ""there are no winners"" from the grand jury decision. ""It is clear that the officer's intention was to do nothing more than take Mr. Garner into custody as instructed and that he used the take-down technique that he learned in the academy when Mr. Garner refused,"" Lynch said. ""No police officer starts a shift intending to take another human being's life and we are all saddened by this tragedy."" Brown and Garner . The grand jury's decision came on the same day that the New York Police Department, in an attempt to bolster public confidence, announced plans to start having some officers wear body cameras. ""When something happens, to have a video record of it, from the police officers' perspective, is going to help in many, many ways,"" de Blasio told reporters. ""And God forbid, when something goes wrong, we are going to have a clearer understanding of what happened."" Parallels mark the deaths of Garner and Brown, both black, starting with crimes they were suspected of: Brown allegedly stole cigars from a convenience store; Garner was allegedly selling cigarettes tax-free. Another similarity that has become the hallmark of protests in Ferguson: Garner put his hands up in the air, as the crook of Pantaleo's elbow tightened around his throat. Some eyewitnesses have said Brown also made that gesture in surrender. But other witnesses contradicted them. No video was rolling, so doubts over that and other details will always hang over the moment that former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shot the unarmed teen. That has led Obama to call for law officers all over the country to record their operations with body cameras. In Garner's case, there can be little doubt what happened. Before he gasped what appeared to be his final breaths, someone hit record on a cell phone camera. The details of his takedown spread through the Internet as the video went viral. Wilson and Pantaleo . In the Ferguson case, Wilson argued before the Missouri grand jury that he shot Brown -- who Wilson said tried to wrest away his gun and then charged at him -- in self-defense. In the Staten Island cell phone video, Garner did not go after Pantaleo but had his back to him; the officer jumped him from behind then tackled him to the ground. The New York Medical Examiner has ruled Garner's death a homicide. The cause of death was ""compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police."" But the medical examiner also listed acute and chronic bronchial asthma, obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors in Garner's death. In Ferguson, Wilson went into hiding after death threats and kept his status of police officer but was placed on leave. He resigned shortly after the grand jury decision. After the chokehold, Pantaleo was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, and the NYPD's commissioner ordered an extensive review of training procedures. Two lawsuits have previously been filed against Pantaleo. The plaintiffs in both suits allege false arrest, unlawful imprisonment, civil rights violations and other charges. One suit from 2013 was dismissed in January 2014, while the second, from February 2014, remains open. Ferguson and New York . In both Ferguson and New York, mostly African-American protesters took to the streets for weeks after both men died to decry police violence. Demonstrators in New York have called the police response during Garner's arrest excessive and criminal, but during protests, the contact between police and demonstrators has been largely cordial. Missing were the tear gas canisters, assault rifles, armored vehicles and the lootings and flying bottles that marred the St. Louis suburb in the wake of Brown's death. When the Missouri grand jury declined to charge Wilson, violence returned to Ferguson, as shot were fired, stores were looted and cars were set on fire. CNN's Dana Ford, Catherine E. Shoichet, Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley, Ben Brumfield, Daniel Verello and Leigh Remizowski contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Make a statement, but make it in peace,"" says Eric Garner's mother .

"""Pack your bags you're going to South Korea.""  These are the words nine young North Korean defectors had waited years to hear having traveled thousands of miles. Unfortunately it was a lie. The tragic story of this group of youngsters aged between 15 and 23 takes us back a few years when one by one they managed to cross the heavily-guarded border from North Korea into China to search for food.  Most of them were orphans, while others had a parent unable or unwilling to look after them. A South Korean missionary living in China, known only as M.J. to protect his identity, tried to help the youngsters and has broken his silence to CNN. ""This one child used to live with his father,"" he explained. ""One day his father went into a North Korean military base trying to find food but was caught and beaten to death on the spot.  The child witnessed this ... his mother then told him not to come home and threw rocks at him to keep him away."" Rodents 'a luxury' The youngsters survived by foraging for scraps in trashcans. Fish bones and discarded rice were mixed to make a porridge, while rodents were considered a luxury.  When M.J. first met some of them in December 2009, they had frostbite on their hands and toes from living in an old abandoned building where temperatures plummeted to as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius.  Some of them had injuries from beatings by security guards and merchants when they were caught stealing food. One of the nine, a 20-year-old man, told M.J. he wanted to live in China as ""even beggars in China do not go hungry."" ""These kids were suffering from malnutrition and disease,"" recalled M.J.  ""They had been living in quarters with bad sanitation ... also they all seemed to have suffered in one form or another from tuberculosis.  Because they were suffering from malnutrition, their growth was stunted."" READ MORE: Report describes North Korea 'atrocities' M.J. and his wife offered to help the youngsters leave China for Laos -- a landlocked country in South-East Asia -- and then onto a third country, perhaps South Korea or the United States to claim asylum.  It is a route that is well traveled by defectors, and the missionary couple had already helped other North Koreans escape to a better life that way. Living in fear . The nine lived with the couple and several other North Korean defectors in China for almost two years in constant fear of being discovered by the authorities. They could never leave the house during this time. China doesn't treat North Koreans in its territory as refugees and usually sends them back across the border. ""The children had been fugitives for a long time so they were used to this situation,"" he said. ""We had a bed which was buttressed with quite a few books on the bottom as legs.  The kids would go under the bed and kick out the books, so the bed would sit low and it would not look like anyone was hiding under it."" The couple tried to organize adoptive parents for the youngsters in the United States but without success.  And so the long trip to the Laos border began. The youngsters experienced some firsts along the way: One defector celebrated his birthday for the very first time; they visited an amusement park, which was a new experience; and they played barefoot on a beach for the first time. Finally, they were able to enjoy simple pleasures many children across the world take for granted. READ MORE: Reunited after 40 years . ""As we lived with these children, I saw them change,"" M.J.'s wife, who also asked not to be identified, said. ""They started having hopes, they started dreaming and I know they were happier.  I was overjoyed to have done something worthwhile."" The escape . After successfully getting six other defectors out of the country to safety via other routes, the missionary couple paid a broker to transport the remaining nine across the China-Laos border because they had no papers or passports. On about May 10 this year, they embarked on a journey that would take them through the jungle in the dead of night to avoid detection. This journey would ordinarily take 40 minutes, according to the missionaries, but this time it took four hours due to heavier than usual border security that day. But crossing the border proved to be the easy part. On a bus en route to the capital, an unexpected police search changed the course of events. The youngsters were detained and then investigated for more than two weeks by Laotian immigration officials because of their lack of paperwork. M.J. admitted the police search surprised him as it had never happened with previous refugees he had helped pass through the country. M.J.'s wife said they repeatedly called the South Korean Embassy in Laos for help.  ""We pled our case with the embassy because this was not just about one life but nine lives of young people ... for the embassy it was extra work and a burden to them and why should they care about these children from North Korea?"" M.J. said embassy officials told them to wait and do nothing to jeopardize things as Laos authorities were working to process the youngsters.  He said no-one from the embassy visited them in eighteen days. Bitter truth . On May 27, the Laos authorities told the youngsters to pack as they were being sent to South Korea.  M.J. said they were so happy they all shouted for joy.  Years in hiding seemed to finally be over.  But the bitter truth of the situation soon became clear. The missionary couple was prevented from following the children and instead locked in a room at the immigration offices for two hours.  The United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, said the group had been sent back to North Korea via China. READ MORE: Defector lives with quarter of a century of guilt . Human rights groups were shocked.  The missionaries were devastated. ""In these children's minds, they were going to South Korea,"" said M.J.'s wife.  ""They never imagined after crossing the border to Laos they would be sent back to North Korea."" The children have since been used for propaganda purposes in Pyongyang, appearing on state-run television in June claiming they had been tricked into leaving North Korea and expressing thanks to leader Kim Jong Un for saving them and bringing them back. ""What I am concerned about is what is going to happen after the propaganda is gone and the rhetoric is over,"" said M.J.  ""If we don't pay attention, if we don't keep asking where these children are, then these children will be lost forever and we will never know what happened to them."" Laos was widely criticized for its actions by the U.N. and human rights groups but insists the youngsters were in their country illegally and that the missionaries were effectively human traffickers. South Korea's foreign ministry told CNN it prioritizes the life and safety of North Korean defectors and is ""inspecting the problems revealed from this incident and has improved and strengthened the overall support system."" But M.J. and his wife fear for the nine youngsters, who dreamed of a life without hunger and fear.","Missionary couple helped to hide young North Korean defectors in China .

"Former Hi-Five R&B singer Russell Neal is in custody after turning himself in to police on July 2,  saying his wife was dead in their Houston apartment. After Houston Fire Department paramedics forced entry into the apartment, they pronounced Catherine Martinez, 24, dead of multiple stab wounds and blunt force head trauma. Officer Richard Ridel of Houston Police Department's homicide unit initially questioned Neal, 40, when he turned himself in at the station. According to Ridel, after Neal was read his Miranda rights, he refused to provide further statements without a lawyer present. Neal did, however, say he and his wife had been in an argument before her death. Police don't know if Neal and Martinez's two sons, ages 3 and 4, were at the scene of their mother's killing. The children are now in the care of Neal's mother. Officers will interview the couple's family and neighbors to ""see what their relationship was like"" and ""whether or not they fought a lot,"" Ridel said. Neal is best known for Hi-Five's No. 1 song, ""I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)."" Debbie Egel, an attorney for Hi-Five, said, ""We are aware of the current situation in Houston, Texas, involving Russell Neal, former member of the legendary '90's R&B group Hi-Five.

"Suspicion that a Norwegian citizen was involved in the deadly Westgate Mall attack in Kenya last month ""has been strengthened"" but is not yet confirmed, Norway's security service said. The Norwegian citizen, said to be of Somali origin, is believed to have ties to Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, known as Ikrima, who is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab. The Norwegian security service, PST, said its investigations in Norway and Kenya were ongoing, and that despite some media outlets reporting a name for the possible Norwegian suspect, it was not ready to confirm his identity. ""It has not yet been determined whether a named Norwegian citizen actually took part in the attack or not,"" a PST statement said Friday. ""Based on the information that we have uncovered this far in the investigation, however, the suspicion of his involvement has been strengthened."" It has also not yet been determined whether the person in question is still alive, the statement said. Kenyan counter terrorism sources said Norwegian intelligence services in Kenya were investigating both Ikrima and the Norwegian citizen and have spoken to the latter's sister in Norway. But Trond Hugubakken, head of communications for the PST, told CNN on Saturday that the two Norwegian officers currently in Kenya are not investigating Ikrima, only the Norwegian citizen and his connections with Al-Shabaab, as they seek to establish whether he was in Kenya. He said the citizen's name would be disclosed by Norwegian authorities only if he's confirmed to be one of the gunmen killed in the mall attack, or if they have sufficient evidence to issue an international warrant for his arrest. Hugubakken said investigators were also questioning people  in Norway. Kenyan authorities suspect Ikrima, also wanted by the United States, of involvement with the Westgate Mall attack. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the bloody four-day siege at the upscale mall in Nairobi, where at least 67 people died. The Islamist group claimed another deadly attack Saturday, this time in the town of Beledweyne, in central Somalia. Somali police officer Isac Ali Abdulle told CNN at least 20 people were killed in the suicide blast at a cafe, although other officials gave a lower death toll. Mohamed Ibrahim Ali, deputy governor of Hiiraan province, said seven government soldiers were among the dead. Al-Shabaab said it was targeting Somali and Ethiopian army commanders in the area. Target of U.S. raid . U.S. officials said Ikrima was the target of a raid earlier this month by U.S. Navy SEALs on an Al-Shabaab compound near the town of Baraawe in Somalia. It's believed that he escaped after the U.S. troops came under heavy fire. A Kenyan intelligence dossier seen by CNN alleges Ikrima's involvement with Briton Samantha Lewthwaite, a terror suspect known as the ""White Widow,"" in a foiled Mombasa attack in 2011 with Jermaine Grant, a fellow British citizen currently held in Mombasa on terror charges. Kenyan intelligence sources say that Ikrima, who speaks six languages and grew up in Kenya, is the main ""point person"" between al Qaeda in Somalia and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and that he has helped pinpoint Kenyan targets. Friends of Ikrima who knew him from his time growing up on the Nairobi suburb of Eastleigh told CNN he traveled to Norway in 2003 and grew increasingly radicalized there. The sources, who had kept up with him over the years, said Ikrima traveled in 2007 to London, where they lost contact with him. In 2008 they heard he was in Somalia, where he has been based since. Arabic, English and Swahili are among the six languages spoken by Ikrima, and he studied French for two years at the Alliance Francais in Nairobi, his friends say. Al-Shabaab's growing reach . The possible involvement of the Norwegian citizen in the Westgate Mall attack has highlighted concerns about the widening reach of Al-Shabaab outside Somali borders. Kenyan counterterror sources told CNN that security camera footage of the attackers inside the mall shows them talking by cellphone to people apparently outside the mall -- who the sources believe were giving the gunmen instructions. Telephone intercepts have led all over the region, from Uganda to Somalia and even possibly to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the sources said. As for the Norway connection, many people have traveled from Scandinavia to Somalia to join Al-Shabaab, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. The leader of Al-Shabaab has been following a strategy aimed at transforming it from a regional insurgent outfit into a terrorist group, Cruickshank said. Ikrima, who is thought to have spent four years in Norway, appears to be central to that strategy, he said. He managed to escape the raid by U.S. Navy SEALs, ""so the concern now is that his credentials really will be burnished in the jihadist community globally, and he will be emboldened to commit more attacks potentially in the region,"" Cruickshank said. Ikrima told a western intelligence informant several years ago that one of his key goals was to carry out attacks back in the West, using recruits from Western nations who'd come to Somalia for training. He is believed to be a key link figure between different terrorist groups including al Qaeda and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and may have key intelligence on future plots. Norwegian suspect . Stig Hansen, a security expert based in Norway and author of the book ""Al-Shabaab in Somalia,"" told CNN that if the Norwegian suspect is who he believes him to be, he lived in a small town in Norway but had connections with a wider group, not all of Somali origin. He came to Norway at age 8 or 9 and stayed for a couple of years, during which time he gained Norwegian citizenship, Hansen said. He later returned to Somalia. Al-Shabaab became quite popular among some Somali community groups in Norway from 2007 to 2009, Hansen said, ""because they were wrongly seen as some kind of national resistance group."" Observers noticed contradictions between what the group said in its English- and Arabic-language messaging, he said, which contributed to ignorance within the diaspora about its real nature. ""But the terrorist attacks inside of Somalia made it easier for the wider ethnic Somali community to see that this was really a terrorist organization, and it distanced itself,"" he said, making it less popular now. However, this development brought its own problems, Hansen said, and not just in Norway. ""What you have to look out for, also in the United States and the United Kingdom and all these other Scandinavian countries, are these small, small networks that are in one sense detached also from the Somali community leaders -- radicalized groups of youths and radical preachers, sheikhs, that go traveling around the various countries to try to incite,"" he said. ""That's what we have to watch these days.""","Suspicion that a Norwegian was involved ""has been strengthened,"" security service says .

"An American woman has died after being stabbed by an unknown attacker in the restroom of a high-end mall in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, police said. Ibolya Ryan, 47, was taken to the hospital after the attack Monday on Reem Island but died of her injuries, Abu Dhabi police said. She worked as a schoolteacher and had 11-year-old twins who are being cared for by authorities until their father, the victim's ex-husband, arrives from abroad, police said. Authorities previously said she was 37. Ryan was stabbed with a sharp tool, later recovered by police, after a fight broke out in the women's restroom, according to Col. Dr. Rashid Mohammad Borshid, head of the Criminal Investigation Department of Abu Dhabi Police. The cause of the fight remains unknown; the suspect fled the scene immediately after committing the crime, he said. Authorities seek witnesses, clues . Police have appealed for help tracking down the killer. ""Investigations are still under way to identify the suspect's identity and gender,"" a police statement Tuesday said. ""Witnesses reported that the culprit was fully covered wearing an abaya, black gloves and face cover (niqab)."" The abaya is a black, full-length gown traditionally worn by local Emirati women. The suspect was also wearing a hijab, or headscarf. Embassy working with UAE authorities . The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi said it was ""working with all the appropriate authorities to seek further information"" about the killing of a U.S. citizen. ""We offer our condolences to those affected by this terrible tragedy,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""The safety and welfare of U.S. citizens abroad is one of the Department of State's highest priorities. We stand ready to provide all possible consular assistance."" The attack happened at the Boutik Mall on Reem Island, a newly developed area of Abu Dhabi where many Western expatriates live. The embassy had issued a statement, back in October, warning U.S. citizens of an anonymous Internet post that encouraged attacks against teachers at American and other international schools. The embassy was unaware of any specific, credible threat at that time, but called on citizens to be vigilant about their personal security. Video shows suspect . CCTV footage released by police shows the suspect, fully covered, walking calmly in through the parking lot entrance, speaking to security guards, picking up a paper and disappearing around the corner out of sight. It then shows the suspect running to the elevator, followed by others, and getting into the elevator, before another clip shows the person leaving the mall through the same parking lot doors. Violent crime in the UAE is rare and eyewitnesses have expressed shock at the incident. ""The Abu Dhabi Police will spare no effort in order to unveil this heinous crime and bring the culprit to justice,"" said Borshid.","U.S. Embassy in October issued a security message to teachers at international schools .

"(CNN)Goodbye, Stephen Colbert. We hardly knew you. In fact, that was the idea, wasn't it? Colbert -- the pugnacious, ""nation""-inspiring champion -- hosted his last ""Colbert Report"" on Comedy Central Thursday night. About six months from now, he will take a new role as host of CBS' ""Late Show."" It will be like Superman changing into Clark Kent -- or, perhaps, into Kal-El. For the Colbert we've been watching bears only a tangential resemblance to the real thing. The real Colbert, as revealed in profiles in the New Yorker and The New York Times, is a modest family man, a devout Catholic with three children who's ""extremely normal,"" one of his neighbors said. The Colbert of the ""Colbert Report"" is bombastic and ironic, equal parts Bill O'Reilly (who's referred to as ""Papa Bear"" on the show) and David Letterman, the man the real Colbert is replacing. Nevertheless, it's worth noting that bombast and irony have paid off handsomely for the onetime ""Daily Show"" correspondent and ""Strangers with Candy"" actor. In some ways, he has become the power he's ridiculed. Without Colbert, we wouldn't have a word for what's now called ""truthiness,"" the concept that if you feel it in your gut, it must be true. (It was Merriam-Webster's word of the year in 2006: the power of Stephen at work.) We wouldn't ""Know a District"" and the sometimes humorless people who are elected to them. And we wouldn't understand how to turn the other cheek to Internet activists who wanted to #cancelColbert. Colbert 'Late Show' staying in New York . Yes, occasionally the Colbert alter ego pushed boundaries a little fiercely. When he was the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner, his scathing jokes about President Bush, the Bush administration and the news media -- delivered with all mere feet away -- hit close to home.   (So close, in fact, that the entertainment for the 2007 dinner was provided by the much safer Rich Little.) And then there was the Colbert super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow. Colbert thought it would show the absurdity of campaign finance laws. It did -- but mainly because both Democrats and Republicans were willing to go along with it. Anything for money, it seems. It's a funhouse mirror that Colbert's partner in crime, Jon Stewart, has willingly supported. Both have found comedy gold through mockery, but if Stewart is the exasperated uncle, Colbert has been the mischievous nephew. By questioning reality through a character, Colbert has actually shown how absurd real reality often is. Obama fills in for Stephen Colbert . No wonder he'll be missed. Who else can symbolize America with a Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor, a NASA device and a minor league hockey mascot? Colbert IS the Real America. Even President Obama paid tribute. Occasionally he's shown us who he is underneath the character, of course. He answered a Reddit AMA very much as himself, and took the time to be a grown man for a Rookie magazine feature. He may be that guy when his ""Late Show"" stint begins. But we don't know who the new Colbert will be. Will he be full of smarm, like a Martin Short parody? A puckish intellectual, a la Dick Cavett? A rollicking Steve Allen type? Whatever he is, he's said he's leaving the ""Colbert Report's"" Colbert behind. Colbert's time slot will be well-cared for, thanks to Larry Wilmore and the ""Nightly Show,"" which will follow Stewart's ""Daily Show"" starting January 19. But his impact may never be equaled. Surprisingly, Colbert was worried that the character wouldn't sustain. As he told The New York Times, ""I thought topical stuff had an ephemeral quality -- it would be meaningless in a week. I wanted my character to be eternal."" No worries there, Stephen Colbert. We'll always remember.

"(CNN) -- Protesters are flooding the streets of New York and elsewhere -- chanting, blocking traffic and demanding change after the decision not to indict in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. Demonstrators staged a ""die-in"" in Brooklyn, New York, late Thursday. They lay in the middle of Atlantic Avenue. An eerie silence descended as the protesters, who had cardboard coffins, stopped chanting. The march was being led by three mothers, all of whom had lost a son to police. Protesters stopped other marchers from getting ahead of the women. They wanted them to walk in front. ""I'm so happy that people of all cultures, all ethnicities, came out to show their love and support, and basically we have to make a change because they're killing us off,"" a protester told CNN. A part of the Brooklyn Bridge was closed. Protesters marched up Broadway, and police used pepper spray on the West Side Highway near Houston Street. The vast majority of the demonstrations were peaceful. ""What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!"" protesters shouted in New York's Foley Square. They chanted Garner's final words: ""I can't breathe!"" Garner, a black man, died in July after a white officer put him in a chokehold on Staten Island. The case cracked open a wider discussion around policing practices in communities of color. ""I'm out here because the system has failed us too many times,"" Courtney Wicker, a protester, told CNN affiliate NY1. ""It makes me feel like there's no justice."" Demonstrations also erupted in Boston, Washington, D.C. and Chicago, where they shut down one of the major roads downtown. Robert Spriggs, 22, a young protester in Washington, told CNN: It feels like we're moving backwards, so if we have to march like it's the '60s, we will. Earlier in Pittsburgh, protesters marched and lay down in the middle of a street. ""It's happening in every city, every town. It's happening here in Pittsburgh,"" Julia Johnson told CNN affiliate WPXI. ""Police are racially profiling people. They are harassing people,"" she said. ""There is just no accountability and no justice for the victims."" The demonstrations raise the question: If the way we police in America is wrong, as many suggest, then what's right? That's the problem police and communities now face in the wake of three high-profile investigations that, collectively, have sparked a national conversation around changing the status quo. In Ferguson, Missouri, violence and chaos erupted after a different grand jury elected not to indict a white officer for killing a black teenager. A nearly two-year investigation by the Justice Department revealed a pattern of excessive force by police in Cleveland. And in New York, officials are still in the midst of grappling with what to do in the wake of Garner's death. His encounter with Officer Daniel Pantaleo was captured on video. Another video shows the dying man lying on the street for more than six minutes as officers calmly wait for an ambulance, showing no sign of urgency. ""Fundamental questions are being asked, and rightfully so, about how we respect peoples' rights -- how we reduce the use of force in the relationship between police and community, in each encounter between police and community -- how we get it right,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The mayor said: ""This tragedy is raising a lot of tough questions. There's tremendous resolve here in this city to answer those questions, to get it right."" Feds launch civil right investigation . Pantaleo may not stand trial in Garner's death, but he's not off the hook. Attorney General Eric Holder said that the U.S. Justice Department will conduct an ""exhaustive and fair"" civil rights probe into the incident. The New York Police Department is taking a fresh look at the case as well, escalating its internal investigation of Garner's death by interviewing more officers. Even if it's not illegal, the city's police department patrol guide states its officers ""will not use chokeholds,"" which it defines as any action pressuring the throat or windpipe. ""Whenever it becomes necessary to take a violent or resisting subject into custody, responding officers should utilize appropriate tactics in a coordinated effort to overcome resistance,"" the patrol guide says. Once this investigation is finished, it's possible that a negotiated settlement will be reached or that there will be a department trial. ""If there's a finding of guilt, a decision will be made as to an appropriate penalty or discipline for that,"" said police Commissioner William Bratton, who would decide on the punishment. Garner's family angry, calls for justice . So who was Eric Garner? Before his death at the age of 43, he was a father of six, as well as a grandfather. He was also someone with a history of run-ins with the law, including 30 arrests. When police confronted him in July, they suspected that he was illegally selling untaxed cigarettes -- something for which he had previously been arrested. But his family, and its supporters, can't understand how anyone could think officers' actions that day were justified. Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, wondered how the grand jury -- which was of mixed race and heard from dozens of police and civilian witnesses between September 29 and December 3 -- could decide there wasn't ""probable cause"" for an indictment after seeing the widely distributed video. And his widow, Esaw Garner, was angry that ""somebody that gets paid to do right did wrong"" and was not held accountable for it. ""But my husband's death will not be in vain. As long as I have a breath in my body I will fight the fight 'til the end,"" she added. Battalions of police watching the protesters wore no riot gear Wednesday night in New York and refrained from the show of armored vehicles and assault rifles that appeared in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. Officers -- on the lookout for people trying to block traffic for long periods of time -- ended up arresting 83 people. Bratton pointed out there was no violence, no vandalism, no looting. This was no accident. Garner's family wanted it that way, with father Ben Carr telling a crowd outside the store where his son gasped in the chokehold, ""We ain't tearing up nothing. We ain't burning up nothing... The police is our problem. No violence. That is all I ask."" Police union says officer just tried to tackle Garner . Pantaleo offered his condolences to Garner's family in a statement. ""I became a police officer to help people and to protect those who can't protect themselves,"" he said. ""It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner."" In addition to the internal investigation, Pantaleo has been the subject of two other lawsuits. In both, the plaintiffs allege false arrest, unlawful imprisonment, civil rights violations and other charges. One suit from 2013 was dismissed in January 2014, while the second, from February 2014, remains open. Speaking specifically about the Garner case, Bratton said he understood people's anger over the scenes on the video, but that he also trusted the legal process and the grand jury's judgment in spite of the images. ""As much as we think video is the final determinant, it is not,"" he said. The grand jury saw much more evidence and argument than the public or he have seen, he said. A judge ruled Thursday against releasing some of the testimony and evidence presented to jurors, one day after the Staten Island district attorney filed a motion asking for such a release, given the public interest in the case. Certain facts about the jury, however, were released. It sat for nine weeks and heard from a 50 witnesses, including civilians, officers and medical personnel. Sixty exhibits were admitted into evidence, including four videos. Pantaleo's police union defended his tackle, with Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch saying ""it is clear that the officer's intention was to do nothing more than take Mr. Garner into custody as instructed and that he used the takedown technique that he learned in the academy when Mr. Garner refused."" ""No police officer starts a shift intending to take another human being's life,"" Lynch said. CNN's Ray Sanchez, Athena Jones, Brooke Baldwin, Kyung Lah, Sarah Aarthun, Catherine E. Shoichet, Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley, Shimon Prokupecz and Daniel Verello contributed to this report.","Demonstrators block a major road in Chicago, stage a ""die-in"" in Brooklyn .

"(CNN) -- Police in Pennsylvania mounted an intense search Monday in the Philadelphia suburbs for a man suspected of killing his ex-wife and five former in-laws, the district attorney for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, said at a Monday night press conference. Bradley William Stone of Pennsburg killed his ex-wife and her mother, grandmother and sister, as well as the sister's husband and 14-year-old daughter, said District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman. But Stone didn't harm his two daughters, who were living with his ex-wife. He took them to a neighbor's residence in Pennsburg, the last place he was seen, Ferman said. ""We do not know where he is,"" Ferman said. ""We do not have vehicle information. We actually recovered his vehicle and his personal cellphone so we do not have information how he might be traveling."" She didn't provide a motive for the slayings. Stone was described as armed and dangerous. Late Monday night, police agencies descended on Doylestown, Pennsylvania, to investigate a possible sighting of Stone, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Doylestown is about 25 miles from Pennsburg. A ""shelter in place"" had been ordered in the surrounding area where the sighting occurred, according to the source, and K-9 units have been asked to respond to the area as well. Suspect led American Legion post . The killings broke the calm in several small towns in Montgomery County, the second wealthiest county in Pennsylvania and the 51st wealthiest in the United States, according to the county government web page. Stone served as a reservist in the U.S. Marines until 2011, mainly as a meteorologist, according to the Marines. He spent a few months in Iraq in 2008. William Schafte of Harleysville, who described himself as a friend, said Stone was a ""good guy"" who helped people who needed money or a hand, according to the Morning Call newspaper of Allentown, Pennsylvania. Stone served as president of the American Legion William E. Hare Post 206 in Lansdale about a decade ago, said the current post commander John Gillmer, the Morning Call reported. ""He was always on the honor guard and stuff like that for parades,"" Gillmer told the Morning Call. ""I was shocked, I couldn't believe it. ... I never would have thought it was one of our guys."" 911 hangup call started investigation . Ferman said the investigation started at 4:25 a.m. with a 911 hangup call directing police to the town of Lansdale, 28 miles northwest of Philadelphia. When police arrived, they found two slain women: Stone's former mother-in-law and former grandmother-in-law, Ferman said. At 4:55 a.m. a neighbor of Stone's ex-wife called 911, Ferman said. Police went to an apartment in Lower Salford and found Nicole Stone, 33, dead. Another neighbor, Michele Brewster said she heard a loud crash and shattering glass. ""Thought I heard a gunshot, but wasn't sure,"" she said. ""A few minutes later I saw flashlights -- it was the cops putting up police tape so I went outside."" Brewster said she asked an officer if gunshots had been fired. He said yes. ""I asked him if she was dead,"" Brewster said, ""but he said he couldn't tell me that."" At 5:30 a.m. Stone delivered his two daughters to a neighbor in Pennsburg, Ferman said. ""That was the last time he was seen by anyone,"" she said. ""I think it's of great significance the children are safe right now."" About 8 a.m., police went to the home of Nicole Stone's sister, Patricia Flick, in Souderton. Officers found Flick, her husband and the couple's 14-year-old daughter dead, Ferman said. The sister's 17-year-old son was wounded and was being treated at a Philadelphia hospital, Ferman said. Suspect may be wearing fatigues . Though last discovered, it appears the killings in Souderton took place first, the district attorney said. Ferman's office said Stone may be wearing military fatigues, in either sand or green color. According to Montgomery County court documents found online, the Stones divorced in 2009. In family court papers, Stone's ex-wife said he claimed in a 2011 hearing that he was ""permanently disabled,"" according to the Veterans Administration, but that he had not applied for Social Security disability benefits. The Marine Corps told CNN it has no record of Stone being injured. ""Earlier today we indicated that he does on occasion use a cane or a walker, but he may or may not be using those devices,"" Ferman said at the press conference. ""It's been indicated to us it may not have been necessary. ... If he has escaped he might be seen using a device or not."" CNN affiliate WPVI said police originally thought Stone was holed up inside the house in Lansdale, so officers surrounded the residence. Heavily armed SWAT teams tossed flash-bang devices into the house and stormed the residence, but police said Stone was not inside. Fast Facts: Rampage killings in the United States .

"Gunmen with the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab killed a Somali former lawmaker and injured a current Parliament member in a drive-by shooting in Somalia's capital Thursday, police said.  It marks the third deadly attack attributed to the group in as many days. The attack in Mogadishu killed former Somali legislator Liibaan Abdullahi. Mustaf Mayow, a current lawmaker, was seriously wounded, police Capt. Muse Farah told CNN. ""Al-Shabaab assailants in a vehicle blocked the (lawmaker's) car,"" Farah said. ""The attackers sped off."" An Al-Shabaab spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack and vowed to carry out similar shootings against Somali lawmakers. On Wednesday the Al-Shabaab militants attacked a United Nations convoy near Mogadishu's airport killing at least four people, according to police . Three of those killed  were civilians and another was a security force member, Police Col. Mohamed Hassan said. Two United Nations vehicles were damaged, a U.N. official said, but no U.N. staff members were killed or injured in the attack. The Mogadishu airport also acts as a staging ground for United Nations operations and for the African Union troops on a peacekeeping mission in Somalia. On Tuesday Al-Shabaab militants raided a quarry in neighboring Kenya, separating non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and executing them, a spokesman for the group said Tuesday. At least 36 bodies were found dumped in the quarry in the village of Kormey, near the Somali border, the Kenyan Red Cross said. Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for mosque raids that Kenyan security forces carried out last month to weed out extremists. The group has been active in East Africa for years, waging an armed campaign that initially aimed to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.","Al-Shabaab militants killed a former Somali Lawmaker Thursday, police say .

"So much for being underwhelmed. After Apple's two new iPhones -- the 5S and 5C -- disappointed some observers when they were unveiled last week, the first round of reviewers are now rendering their verdicts after spending time with the devices. And in contrast to initial reactions, which included yawns from tech sites and a dip in Apple's stock price, the first wave of reviews are largely singing the praises of the new phones -- particularly the top-of-the-line iPhone 5S, which comes packed with an upgraded 64-bit processor, souped up camera and Apple's first-ever Touch ID fingerprint-scanning system. Many noted that, like the iPhone 4S before, the 5S is more of an upgrade of the 5 than a radically new device, a fact that probably led to a lot of the mixed initial response. But under the hood, many say the iPhone 5S is truly different, and one reviewer is even calling it the best smartphone on the market. Here are some of those reviews. Unless otherwise noted, the reviewer is referring to the iPhone 5S. Walt Mossberg, All Things Digital . ""The iPhone 5s is the first digital device I've seen with a simple, reliable fingerprint reader -- one you can confidently use, without a thought, to unlock the device instead of typing in a passcode. ... It sounds like a gimmick, but it's a real advance, the biggest step ever in biometric authentication for everyday devices."" ""My biggest disappointment is that there have been only minor improvements to the keyboard. Unlike in Android, Apple still bars you from substituting third-party keyboards with better auto-correction ... .  Overall, however, the new iPhone 5s is a delight. Its hardware and software make it the best smartphone on the market."" Darrell Etherington, TechCrunch . ""Apple has worked some behind-the-scenes magic with its latest and greatest, and made some design changes for the better, too, all of which adds up to a new smartphone market king."" ""At first glance, it's easy to dismiss the fingerprint sensor as a whiz-bang feature designed to attract eyeballs and do little else. But this isn't that. ... It feels like a mature feature that actually enhances the overall experience of using an iPhone in a noticeable way that you encounter very frequently."" ""The hardware may resemble its predecessor in many key ways, as with the 4-inch Retina display, but it improves dramatically in areas like the camera where it makes the most difference to every day users, and in the addition of the fingerprint sensor, which is already a feature I miss when I switch back to older generation devices or the iPhone 5c."" Anand Lal Shimpi, AnandTech . ""Like the S-devices that came before it, the iPhone 5s is left in the unfortunate position of not being able to significantly differentiate itself visually from its predecessor. ...  I think gold is likely the phone I'd opt for simply because it'd be very different than everything else I have, but otherwise space grey is probably the best looking of the three devices to me."" ""It remains to be seen the impact display size has on iPhone sales. Anecdotally I know a number of die hard iPhone users who simply want a larger display and are willing to consider Android as a result. I still believe that users don't really cross shop between Android and iOS, but if Apple doesn't offer a larger display option soon then I believe it will lose some users not because of cross shopping, but out of frustration."" ""At the end of the day, if you prefer iOS for your smartphone -- the iPhone 5s won't disappoint. In many ways it's an evolutionary improvement over the iPhone 5, but in others it is a significant step forward. What Apple's silicon teams have been doing for these past couple of years has really started to pay off. "" David Pogue, New York Times . ""If we're reaching a point of diminishing returns in hardware breakthroughs, the software breakthroughs are only just getting under way.The new iPhones come with iOS 7, a redesigned operating system. ... This software looks nothing like the old iOS. It's all white and clean, almost barren. ... You might love this design, and you might loathe it. You also might get used to it. But in any case, iOS 7 is more efficient to navigate, because nothing on the screen is eye candy; everything is a button, so you spend less time hunting for things."" ""If you wanted to summarize ... here it is: Apple still believes in superb design and tremendous polish. The iPhone is no longer the only smartphone that will keep you delighted for the length of your two-year contract -- but it's still among the few that will."" On the iPhone 5C:  ""It's essentially identical to last year's iPhone 5, except that its back and sides are a single piece of plastic instead of metal and glass. It's a terrific phone. The price is right. It will sell like hot cakes. ... But just sheathing last year's phone in shiny plastic isn't a stunning advance."" Lauren Goode, All Things Digital . On the iPhone 5C: ""You've seen this phone before. Sure, it has a new name: iPhone 5c. And its plastic body comes in different colors. It also has an attractive price when tied to a wireless contract. But the 5c is really a slightly improved iPhone 5, which Apple is no longer offering. While the 5c looks and feels very familiar, it's still a good phone and an improvement over the 5. But its improvements are evolutionary, not revolutionary."" Myriam Joire, Engadget . ""Though it's easy to dismiss this handset as iterative, the 5s is the first smartphone with full 64-bit support and a capacitive fingerprint sensor, and it also ships with a fresh, revamped version of iOS. This might not matter to folks who were content with the status quo, but it matters a lot to Apple -- and to the company's future as well -- especially if the company wants to fend off an increasingly fierce pack of competitors."" ""The 5s is a solid effort from Apple, but its true worth is yet to be determined. If developers come up with clever ways to take advantage of the M7 coprocessor and the 64-bit support in iOS 7, the 5s will truly shine. If not, many people might just wait it out another year.""","Early reviews positive for the iPhone 5S .
""The best smartphone on the market,"" says one reviewer .
Some say fingerprint scanner is significant, not a gimmick .
iPhone 5C called ""iPhone 5, but colorful plastic"""
"(CNN) -- Who to believe about the CIA's program of enhanced interrogation -- aka, torture? On the one hand, the Senate's report states that it didn't produce any intelligence that could not have been gained by other means, that it amounted to brutality for the sake of being brutal. On the other hand, former Vice President Dick Cheney has asserted that the report is ""full of crap,"" and that he is personally satisfied that the program was necessary and useful. It seems as if an attempt to gain insight into what the state secretly does to those who threaten it is now being recast as a partisan debate. And that's tragic, because while some element of petty politics may indeed be involved -- as identified by former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey, no less -- it shouldn't distract from the national, moral challenge raised by this report. The challenge for the United States is how to best strike the balance between freedom and security. Cheney's big government conservatives would argue that liberty sometimes has to be surrendered in order to protect life and limb -- and that this trade-off is a no-brainer when the people being asked to make the sacrifice aren't even U.S. citizens and are self-evidently a threat to the United States. In short: Who really cares what happens to America's enemies? There are two problems with that perspective. First, immoral acts are immoral acts regardless of who they are carried out against. All people are owed their dignity. That principle is there in Genesis: ""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."" And it's there in the U.S. Declaration of Independence: All men are ""created equal"" and ""endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights."" So if the state does terrible things to foreigners, it is, logically, violating what are held to be the universal rights of all people. And make no mistake: The CIA violated rights when it practiced its ""enhanced interrogations."" The report contains examples of a prisoner being forced to play Russian roulette, threats to sexually abuse family members, and a detainee dying of suspected hypothermia due to neglect. Such moral outrages are no less outrageous because they happened to bad people who can't vote in a U.S. election. Second, faced with the gruesome details of this torture, we are compelled to question the idea that surrendering a little liberty to the state will result in increased security. It is true that there have been no more successful terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. But intelligence operations have not noticeably made the world outside America any safer, because they do not address the political, religious and economic factors driving Islamism. In my country of Great Britain, a soldier was virtually decapitated in the street by radicals -- both known, incidentally, to our security services. Iraq and Syria are fighting off a caliphate. American diplomatic personnel have been killed in Libya. It may well be true that the horrors could have been greater without the CIA's dirty work. But, things that did not happen cannot be properly assessed. How does Dick Cheney prove such an unknown unknown? Moreover, any state apparatus that operates beyond the law cannot truly be regarded as operating in the interests of the law. Covert operations in the 1970s designed to destabilize proto-communist movements did not produce healthy democracies, but resulted in the creation of authoritarian regimes that, without any regard for constitutional niceties, abused their own people. The very fact that so much secret activity is found to operate outside the bounds of congressional oversight and, potentially, the Constitution itself suggests that it is more anarchic than conservative. We can see the consequences of having too much faith in state institutions permitted to use violence in the recent riots over the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson, Missouri. A tendency towards confrontation and an over-armed police force did not bring order, but instead created the conditions under which the town descended into chaos. Do not presume, as Dick Cheney does, that the use or threat of state violence will guarantee civil peace. On the contrary, undermining liberty can also result in undermining stability. We may find that public interest in this scandal wanes. The 2016 elections will neither be determined by candidates' stances on the NSA surveillance controversy, nor, probably, will the fate of a few terrorists trouble primary voters. Remember that George H.W. Bush did not suffer in the 1988 election for his alleged role in Iran-Contra -- indicating that voters often tolerate what many regard as an excess of well-intentioned enthusiasm in defending the nation. But they ought to feel different. The proper functioning of a democratic republic does not exclusively rely upon having a moral leadership. It also requires having a moral citizenry that regularly scrutinize the things done in its name.","Timothy Stanley: Dick Cheney says torture report is ""crap,"" program was necessary, useful .

"(CNN) -- The families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and other unarmed black men felled by bullets or police force filled a podium in the nation's capital. ""This is a history-making moment,"" said Garner's mother, Gwen Carr. ""It's just so overwhelming to see all who have come to stand with us. Look at the masses -- black, white, all races, all religions. ... We need to stand like this at all times."" Invoking the familiar names of black men who died at the hands of police, tens of thousands marched throughout the nation on Saturday to protest what they see as rampant racial injustice. The throngs -- young and old, black and white -- took to the streets in major cities, including New York, Washington, Boston, San Francisco and Oakland, California. In Washington, a crowd of thousands snaked up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol in a protest that evoked memories of past civil rights marches. The crowds appear to represent a burgeoning movement sparked by the decisions of grand juries in Missouri and New York not to indict white police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men. Garner died in July when New York police officers on Staten Island wrestled him to the ground, with one of the officers wrapping his arm around Garner's neck. 'Sea of people"" ""What a sea of people,"" said Lesley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by a Ferguson, Missouri, officer in August. ""If they don't see this and make a change, then I don't know what we got to do,"" Thousands marched in Boston, starting at the Massachusetts State Capitol. Police arrested 23 people on disorderly conduct charges, according to the Massachusetts State Police. One man was charged with assault and battery on a police officer. From New York's Washington Square Park, thousands marched to police headquarters chanting ""I can't breathe"" -- Garner's last words -- and ""How do you spell racist: NYPD."" The march was largely peaceful, although a protester from a splinter group hurled a garbage can through the window of an NYPD traffic car. ""I stand here as a black man who is afraid of the police,"" said marcher Ahmad Greene-Hayes, ""who is afraid of never knowing when my life might end, never knowing when I might be ... gunned down by a vigilante or a security guard or a police officer."" Michaela Angela Davis, a writer and frequent CNN guest who participated in the march, said the demonstrations signal a lasting movement. ""The collective self-esteem that's happening with these young people is really powerful,"" she said. ""They know they are part of history."" Protesters demand change . In Washington, many carried signs with now familiar messages: ""Black lives matter,"" ""Hold cops accountable"" and ""I can't breathe."" ""It's systematic racism that is instilled in our government,"" said Shanna Lawrie, her hands in the air as she marched to the Capitol. ""We come in peace but we come strong,"" said Ashley Sharpton, daughter of the Rev. Al Sharpton, an organizer of the Washington march. ""We come with demands. We want the government to get involved."" Protesters are demanding a more aggressive federal response to racially charged incidents involving police. Another marcher was Samaria Rice, whose 12-year-old son, Tamir, was carrying a toy gun when a Cleveland police officer fatally shot him in a park. The local medical examiner ruled his death a homicide. Marc Morial, head of the National Urban League, said protesters are demanding body and dashboard cameras for police, special prosecutors to investigate police misconduct and laws against racial profiling. New York City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who marched in Washington, said the protest needed to move beyond police brutality and focus on issues such as housing, unemployment and better schools. ""That's where we need to steer the conversation,"" he said. ""That's where the anger is."" What the officers say . Daniel Pantaleo, the New York police officer shown on video wrestling Garner to the pavement with his arm around his neck, spoke with internal affairs investigators this week. His attorney says Pantaleo did not use a chokehold but a ""takedown technique"" he learned in the police academy. ""He said he never exerted any pressure on the windpipe and never intended to injure Mr. Garner,"" attorney Stuart London said. Police had confronted Garner on the sidewalk for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson resigned from the department last month. He testified to a St. Louis County grand jury that he shot Brown after the 18-year-old tried to take his gun and then charged at him. The results of autopsies, including one by a Justice Department medical examiner, showed that among Brown's multiple gunshot wounds was one to his hand at close range. That supports Wilson's account of a struggle at his patrol car but doesn't explain why Wilson continued shooting at least five more times.

"Protesters in New York City sang ""justice carols"" and demonstrators in several cities held more die-ins Sunday to show their anger over a grand jury's decision to not indict a police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. In New York City, a few hundred protesters gathered again at Grand Central station and Macy's in Herald Square -- sites of multiple die-ins over the past few days -- before barging through the nearby Toys R Us to lie on the floor en masse. One young couple made the event a family affair, lying on the floor with their toddler between them. A group went to Penn Station to sing ""justice carols,"" such as these lyrics to the tune of ""Little Drummer Boy:"" ""Help, he told them, . pa rum pum pum pum, . I cannot breathe, you see, . pa rum pum pum pum, . Our city's finest bring, . pa rum pum pum pum, . Death to this human being."" The mother of Eric Garner said Sunday she's proud people protesting the death of her son have been peaceful for the most part. ""The riots have been so beautiful, so nicely done,"" Gwen Carr said at her church on Staten Island, according to CNN affiliate NY1. ""And peace is the message. We don't want any violence but keep on moving on."" In Chicago, about 250 people gathered at Saint Sabina Church to chant ""black lives matter"" before lying down in silence, reported CNN affiliate WGN. ""I'll be wearing black and invite members to do so as well, as a sign of mourning for those who have lost their lives to violence,"" the Rev. Michael Pfleger of Saint Sabina said in a statement before the event. St. Louis Rams jerseys burned . In Imperial, Missouri, a group held a different kind of protest Sunday. They burned St. Louis Rams football jerseys because they're unhappy five players ran onto the field last Sunday making the hands-up-don't-shoot gesture, according to CNN affiliate KSDK. That gesture has become part of anti-police demonstrations following a grand jury's decision not to indict anybody in the Michael Brown slaying, . ""Why would you do something like that? It's utterly ridiculous,"" said Larry Magee. ""I think the Rams ought to pack their bags, and I'll give them a plane ticket back to L.A."" Early Sunday, protests turned violent in northern California when some masked demonstrators smashed windows while others pelted officers with rocks and bottles, authorities said. Police said about 200 people were on Berkeley streets for another day of protests over a grand jury decision not to indict New York City  Officer  Daniel Pantaleo for Garner's death on July 17. But as some broke windows at businesses in the city, other protesters implored them to stop the violence. Police in riot gear lined the streets while others hovered nearby on motorbikes. They warned crowds to disperse, but some vandalized various businesses, including a Trader Joe's and a Wells Fargo Bank, police said. Authorities used teargas to break up the crowds,  said Jennifer Coats, a spokeswoman for the Berkeley Police Department. ""A small portion of protesters have been violent. They started throwing rocks and other projectiles at our officers,"" Coats said. Two officers suffered minor injuries as a result, including one who was treated for a dislocated shoulder. Garner's mother to protesters: 'Keep on doing it, but do it in peace' Nationwide protests . Protesters have taken to the streets nationwide. ""What's happening in these cities in these last several days is incredibly important to show we have a unified voice,"" said Judi Flournoy,  who was participating in a New York protest. In New York, the victim's widow, Esaw Garner Snipes, has said watching the mass of demonstrators from her Staten Island home brings tears to her eyes. She said she told her son, ""Look at all the love your father is getting."" On Saturday, dozens of protesters staged ""die ins"" -- lying down on the ground in memory of Garner -- at Grand Central Station in Manhattan and Union Station in Washington. Meanwhile, New York officials said complaints against police officers fell significantly in the second half of the year, compared with July to November 2013. A report that tallied complaints said 1,813 were made so far since July 1 of this year, 26% fewer than the number of complaints filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board in the same period of the prior year. Excessive force allegations fell by 29%. The dip followed a slight rise in the first six months of the year, the report said. But overall, allegations have declined in 2014.

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania district attorney says there may never be closure in the case of a man suspected of killing his ex-wife and five former in-laws. ""There's no excuse; there's no valid explanation. There's no justification for snuffing out these six innocent lives and then injuring another child. This is just a horrific tragedy,"" Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told reporters Tuesday. The body of the suspect, Bradley William Stone, was found with what looked to be self-inflicted wounds. The former Marine reservist had been on the run since Monday's slayings shook small communities north of Philadelphia. Although a final report from the coroner is pending, Stone appears to have died from self-inflicted cutting wounds, in the center of his body, according to Ferman. His body was found in a wooded area about 1/2 mile from his home in Pennsburg. It was not immediately clear how long the remains had been there. ""When you look at the three different locations, the number of people killed, clearly we are looking at a premeditated killing -- a planned killing, an intentional, deliberate killing,"" said Ferman. The slayings . The killings broke the calm in several small towns in Montgomery County, the second wealthiest county in Pennsylvania and the 51st wealthiest in the United States, according to the county government web page. Early Monday morning, a hangup call to 911 first tipped off police to the bloodshed, directing them to Lansdale, 28 miles northwest of Philadelphia. When police arrived, they found two slain women: Stone's former mother-in-law and former grandmother-in-law, Ferman said. A short time later, a neighbor of Stone's ex-wife called 911, the prosecutor explained. Police went to an apartment in Lower Salford and found 33-year-old Nicole Stone dead. ""I heard three or four gunshots and I heard the kids yelling, saying, 'Mommy, no. No, mommy, no.' And he just said, 'Let's go. We gotta go,'"" a neighbor who did not want to be identified told CNN affiliate WFMZ. ""I heard him say, 'Let's go. We gotta get in the car.'"" ""They didn't have any coats on or anything,"" the neighbor said. ""They just had their pajamas on, and he just said, 'We gotta go.' He was like, 'She's hurt. She's hurt pretty bad. We have to leave.' And just got in the car and sped off."" In addition to Nicole Stone, her mother, grandmother and sister were found dead, as well as the sister's husband and 14-year-old daughter, Ferman said. The sister's 17-year-old son was being treated at a Philadelphia hospital. Ferman said that the teen, who sustained cutting injuries to his hands and head, was in serious condition. But Stone didn't harm his two daughters, who were living with his former wife. At about 5:30 a.m., he brought them to a neighbor's residence in Pennsburg, according to Ferman. ""That was the last time he was seen by anyone,"" the attorney said. ""I think it's of great significance the children are safe right now."" Ferman said Stone and his ex-wife had been involved with ongoing and contentious custody disputes. ""We learned that just last week he had made an effort in court to try to secure custody -- emergency custody of the children -- and that was denied,"" she said. Who is Stone? According to Montgomery County court documents found online, the Stones divorced in 2009. Fast Facts: Rampage killings in the United States . Stone served as a reservist in the U.S. Marines until 2011, mainly as a meteorologist, according to the Marines. He spent a few months in Iraq in 2008. William Schafte of Harleysville, who described himself as a friend, called Stone a ""caring guy"" who loved his country. ""I was totally shocked. I didn't really think that he was capable of doing such a horrific thing like this,"" he told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" ""He would ... go the extra mile to help anybody out. This is just, it's a total shock to me and to his other friends."" Stone served as president of the American Legion William E. Hare Post 206 in Lansdale about a decade ago, said current post commander John Gillmer, the Morning Call newspaper of Allentown reported. ""He was always on the honor guard and stuff like that for parades,"" Gillmer told the Morning Call. ""I couldn't believe it. ... I never would have thought it was one of our guys."" The Upper Perkiomen School District called off classes Tuesday. Following the announcement of Stone's death, it said schools would reopen at regular times Wednesday.

"When the cheers subside in Tahrir Square, Mohamed Morsi will assume an Egyptian presidency straightjacketed by the country's military, start work under intense international scrutiny and inherit a country on its back economically. He'll face the skepticism of people like Mohamed Saleh, one of the throng that waited for Sunday's declaration of Morsi's victory in Tahrir Square. Even as he cheered the result, Saleh said the real power in Egypt still lies with the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which took power after the ouster of longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak. ""They don't give us power. Mohamed Morsi is just a name of president,"" Saleh said. ""He doesn't have the power, SCAF has the power."" Egypt's electoral commission declared Morsi the country's president-elect Sunday after a runoff with Ahmed Shafik, a former air force general who served as Mubarak's last prime minister. With the announcement of Morsi's victory, cheers erupted in Tahrir Square, the Cairo plaza that was the center of the 2011 revolt that toppled Mubarak. Morsi urges unity in first speech . His supporters already are pushing for a confrontation with the generals, who recently ordered an elected, Islamist-dominated parliament dissolved and announced they would retain legislative power for an indefinite time. ""Will the military council respect the Egyptian will or not?"" asked Abdoul Mawgoud Dardery, a member of parliament from Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of Egypt's long-suppressed Muslim Brotherhood. ""If it respects it, we will be able to work together. If it does not, the military council knows very well where Mubarak is right now."" Dardery said the Brotherhood and its supporters would remain in Tahrir Square until they get what they want. Khaled Fahmy, a historian at the American University in Cairo, said that determination is born of the hard lessons that followed the ouster of Mubarak, who has been sentenced to life in prison for ordering the killings of anti-government protesters in the 2011 revolt. World leaders, regular folks react to Morsi's victory . ""We thought the revolution was over, that we won when we forced the president to resign, and we went back home,"" Fahmy told CNN. ""And obviously, the revolution was far from being over, and our demands were far from being answered."" SCAF dissolved parliament elected earlier this year following a ruling by Egypt's high court that the law governing the parliamentary elections was invalid. The generals said the new president would set a date for parliamentary elections and would have the power to appoint government officials, name ambassadors to foreign countries and grant pardons --  but the junta will keep legislative power and the budget in its hands until new lawmakers are elected. The Brotherhood and the secular liberal groups that launched the 2011 protests have to maintain that presence to keep pressure on the government, Fahmy said. Meanwhile, he said, the military's announcement that it would retain legislative and budgetary power ""is effectively a recipe for at best a paralysis in the executive branch of the government."" The Muslim Brotherhood explained . At worst, it could mean a fight with the generals at a time when Egypt's economy is still recovering from the nosedive that accompanied the revolution. ""They've lost 2 million jobs since February of last year,"" said U.S. congressman David Dreier, an election observer during the runoff. ""By virtue of that, they really need to get the economy growing and get people back to work."" Dreier, a California Republican, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he is backing a U.S.-Egyptian free trade bill in Congress in hopes of boosting Egyptian fortunes. Before the revolution, about 40% of Egyptians lived in poverty. Tourism was the bedrock of the country's economy, ""and it has come to standstill"" amid the past year's turmoil,"" Fahmy said. ""The unemployment rate has hiked up. There's not much inflation, but occasionally shortages in fuel and shortages of basic supplies,"" he said. Who is Mohamed Morsi? Morsi vowed to revive the economy in the speech he delivered to the nation late Sunday, telling Egyptians their resources were plentiful but had been ""squandered and mismanaged."" And Cairo's stock market jumped more than 3% on Sunday, which Fahmy called ""an indication of how sensitive the markets are for stability."" ""In a sense, it's a vote for the fact that it's democracy that brings stability rather than the military or the police,"" he said. ""It's not a flight of capital out of Egypt because of Islamists winning, it's the exact opposite. It's a vote of confidence not so much in the Brotherhood itself, but in the democratic process."" Egypt has long been the leading U.S. ally in the Arab world, receiving $1.3 billion annually in American military aid for decades. Its peace treaty with Israel is a cornerstone of regional diplomacy. Israel has reacted cautiously to the elections, issuing a statement Sunday that it ""appreciates the democratic process in Egypt and respects the results of the presidential elections."" ""Israel looks forward to continuing cooperation with the Egyptian government on the basis of the peace treaty between the two countries, which is a joint interest of both peoples and contributes to regional stability,"" the statement said. Despite his previous fierce criticism of Israel -- including calling Israeli leaders ""vampires"" and ""killers"" -- Morsi pledged Sunday night that Egypt ""will preserve all national and international agreements"" under his leadership. Edwin Walker, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, told CNN that abandoning the treaty was ""not going to be possible."" ""You can't just tear up the peace treaty and start over again,"" he said. And Fahmy said the hard realities of the economy and the still-unsettled revolution are likely to make revisiting the Egyptian-Israeli pact a distant prospect. ""I don't think foreign relations, or specifically relations with Israel, will be on the top of their priority list,"" he said. ""They are way too smart to open up this question now, and I don't think they're too keen on opening it on the medium front."" Why Hosni Mubarak's death wouldn't change Egypt's future . Morsi also may have to deal with a split in the ranks of his own party, between those who may advocate smoothing things over with the generals and others who want to cultivate ties with secular liberals and leftists. ""The Brotherhood is a huge organization. It is a very venerable organization. It is an old one,"" Fahmy said. ""But I think it is also facing its greatest threat, and it's a threat paradoxically prompted by its victory."" The group survived years of crackdowns by Egyptian rulers by staying underground, insisting on cohesion and secrecy and not tolerating dissent. But now, ""We're seeing youthful brothers who, in my reading, have much more in common with the secularist revolutionaries than with the elderly Muslim Brotherhood members."" Nevertheless, the arrival of a democratically elected leader is a moment Egyptians have awaited ""for the past 7,000 years,"" Dardery said. ""This is a great moment in history, and we're going to be making history from now on,"" he said.","Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's president-elect, now inherits a variety of problems .
Egypt's military still claims legislative and budget power, restricting his authority .

"(CNN)A Brazilian man has confessed to killing 39 women in the Rio de Janeiro region, police said Thursday -- shocking claims that, if confirmed, would make him one of the most prolific serial killers in the country's history. In an interview with Brazilian broadcaster TV Globo, the alleged killer, Sailson Jose das Gracas, said that he carried out the first slaying when he was 17 and continued to kill over the next decade. ""I started robbing purses and small things like that,"" he told TV Globo. ""And as I got older, I started having a different thoughts. My thoughts started changing. From stealing, I started thinking about killing."" Sailson, reported to be 26-years-old, said he didn't kill impulsively but stalked his victims. Rio police said they arrested Sailson on Wednesday on suspicion of killing a woman in the suburb of Nova Iguacu. He confessed to that homicide and then told police about the other killings, they said. Sailson described his need to kill as pathological. ""When I didn't kill, I would get nervous,"" he told TV Globo. ""I would pace around the house, and then when I killed, it calmed me."" Police chief Marcelo Machado told TV Globo that Sailson is also suspected of killing a 2-year-old boy, the son of one of the dead women. Fast Facts on serial killers . 'No regrets' Specialized police teams are carrying out an investigation into his claims. ""We must carefully examine, one by one,"" Machado said. Police said they had located four other cases from the homicide division that had the same modus operandi presented by Sailson, who told them he used knives to kill. Police said they had also arrested a man and woman, who Sailson said had told him to kill the latest victim. The self-declared killer said he had ""no regrets"" about his actions and would kill again if set free. ""What is done is done,"" he told the TV network.

"President Barack Obama prodded Congress to eliminate the United States' decades-old Cuba embargo Friday, saying that improving relations with the communist country will help open its ""hermetically sealed society"" -- even if changes come in ""fits and starts."" He said he doesn't expect lawmakers to strip the embargo away immediately, and that Congress will need time to digest a deal he struck this week to free American contractor Alan Gross, trade imprisoned spies and ease U.S. economic restrictions on Cuba in exchange for the release of dozens of political prisoners and expanded Internet there. His comments came during a feisty year-end news conference Friday, just hours before Obama and his family boarded Air Force One for a holiday vacation in Hawaii. ""I don't anticipate overnight changes. But what I know deep in my bones is that if you've done the same thing for 50 years and nothing's changed, you should try something different if you want a different outcome, and this gives us an opportunity for a different outcome, because suddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways that it has not been before,"" Obama said. ""The more the Cuban people see what's possible, the more interested they are going to be in change. But how societies change is country-specific. It's culture-specific,"" he said. Obama offered some notes of caution, saying a presidential visit Cuba or Cuban President Raul Castro coming to the United States isn't ""in the cards."" His moves have already triggered controversy among potential Republican 2016 presidential contenders. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who accused Obama of giving up leverage, is sparring with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who advocates a smaller U.S. footprint overseas. Obama said he expects a ""healthy debate"" to rage in Congress. ""I think that ultimately we need to go ahead and pull down the embargo, which I think has been self-defeating in advancing the aims that we're interested in,"" Obama said. ""But I don't anticipate that that happens right away."" Obama sounded an optimistic tone, saying he is ""energized"" and ""excited"" about the final two years of his presidency even after Democrats in Congress were shellacked in November's midterm election. ""My presidency is entering the fourth quarter,"" Obama said. ""Interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter. And I am looking forward to it."" The President immediately made headlines by saying Sony ""made a mistake"" canceling a movie after North Korea's hack. He also drew attention for calling on female journalists for all eight of the questions he took -- which White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said was intentional. ""The fact is, there are many women from a variety of news organizations who day-in and day-out do the hard work of covering the President of the United States,"" Earnest said. ""As the questioner list started to come together, we realized that we had a unique opportunity to highlight that fact at the President's closely watched, end of the year news conference."" Obama touched on the clashes that are guaranteed to come once Republicans take full control of Congress in January, setting up showdowns over Obama's signature health care law, the Keystone XL pipeline that conservatives would like to green-light, financial regulations and more. He identified international trade and tax reform as areas he might be able to find common ground with the GOP-led House and Senate, and said staff-level conversations will take place between Obama's White House and GOP congressional leadership between now and the Jan. 20 State of the Union address about individual and corporate tax reform. Obama said he'll issue proposals of his own to overhaul the corporate tax structure. ""Then there are other companies that are paying zero because they've got better accountants or lawyers. That's not fair,"" he said. ""There are companies that are parking money outside the country because of tax avoidance. We think it's important that everybody pay something if they are effectively headquartered in the United States."" But he threatened to veto any bills that would weaken the health care law or rolls back any of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial services reforms -- which were recently thrust into the spotlight after liberals howled over the roll-back of one of those reforms in a deal this month to fund the government. ""I think there are going to be some tough fights on those areas where we disagree,"" Obama said. ""If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me. If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no, and I'm confident that I will be able to uphold vetoes on those types of provisions."" Here's what Obama said about several other issues Friday: . KEYSTONE PIPELINE -- President Barack Obama said the Keystone XL pipeline -- which Republican congressional leaders have said they intend to approve legislation to authorize early next year -- is ""not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers."" Obama didn't threaten to veto a bill that would take approval of the 1,179-mile, Canada-to-Texas pipeline out of the State Department's hands. But he downplayed its potential effects and said that if Congress wants to create the kinds of construction jobs that could accompany the pipeline, it should instead approve bills to improve the country's infrastructure. ""There's very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices -- what the average American consumer cares about -- by having this pipeline come through,"" Obama said. ""And sometimes, the way this gets sold is, 'Let's get this oil and it's going to come here,' and the implication is, it's going to lower oil prices here in the United States -- and it's not. There's a global oil market."" RACIAL TENSIONS WITH POLICE -- Obama argued that ""really concrete, practical"" law enforcement reforms will result from a review his administration is currently producing, and sounded an optimistic tone about preventing deaths like Michael Brown's in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner's in New York City in the future. ""What I don't think is always captured in our political debates is, the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing. And people are basically good and have good intentions,"" Obama said. ""Sometimes our institutions and our systems don't work as well as they should. Sometimes you've got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and hasn't maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around."" ""But if you offer practical solutions, I think people want to fix these problems,"" he said. ""This isn't a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying. I think that troubles everybody. So there's an opportunity of all of us to come together and take a practical approach to these problems."" THE ECONOMY -- He called 2014 the ""strongest year for job growth since the 1990s"" and pointing to rising middle class wages, increased energy production and lower gas prices, and highlighted recent economic reports that have identified a 57-month streak of job growth, producing 11 million new positions. ""As a country, we have every right to be proud of what we've accomplished: More jobs, more people insured, a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy -- pick any metric that you want; America's resurgence is real. We are better off,"" Obama said. He said gas prices are 70 cents lower this year than they were last Christmas, and the Obama administration's bailout of the automotive industry is ""effectively over."" ""Yes, there were crises that we had to tackle around the world -- many that were unanticipated,"" Obama said. ""We have more work to do to make sure our economy, our justice system and our government work not just for the few but the many. But there is no doubt we can enter into the new year with renewed confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts."" NORTH KOREA'S SONY HACK -- Sony ""made a mistake"" in halting the release of its film ""The Interview"" after hackers that the FBI has linked to North Korea stole the company's documents and threatened theaters that showed the film,"" Obama said. ""We cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States, because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they'll do when they see a documentary that they don't like, or news reports that they don't like -- or even worse, imagine if producers or distributors or others start engaging in self-censorship because they don't want to offend the sensibilities of somebody whose sensibilities probably need to be offended,"" Obama said. ""So, you know, that's not who we are. That's not what America's about. Again, I'm sympathetic that Sony as a private company was worried about liabilities and this and that and the other. I wish they'd spoken to me first. I would have told them, do not get into a pattern in which you're intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks,"" he said.","President Barack Obama said Sony ""made a mistake"" canceling its movie release .

"In some of his broadest remarks on racism yet, President Barack Obama said Friday that he believes while there are ""some hidden biases that we all carry around,"" people are ""basically good"" and want to fix those problems, if given solutions. ""What I don't think is always captured in our political debates is, the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing. And people are basically good and have good intentions,"" Obama said during his year-end press conference Friday. ""Sometimes our institutions and our systems don't work as well as they should. Sometimes you've got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and hasn't maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around,"" he added. Obama referenced Eric Garner, the unarmed African-American man who died after he was put in a chokehold by a white police officer, saying that ""this isn't a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying."" ""I think that troubles everybody,"" Obama said. But he argued, ""if you offer practical solutions, I think people want to fix these problems."" His remarks came in response to a question on the state of blacks in America today, which he acknowledged remains problematic. He said African-Americans still face an income gap with whites, what he called ""a legacy of a troubled racial past."" African-Americans are ""starting behind"" because of this, Obama said, and Americans ""should be willing to provide people a hand up, not a hand-out"" to help improve those conditions. The still-fraught state of race relations in America has become a subject of national debate in recent weeks following the acquittal of two white police officers who shot two unarmed black men, in unrelated incidents in Missouri and New York City. Americans frustrated with what many see as unequal treatment of blacks by police officers have launched protests across the nation. And Obama created a task force to examine police tactics and propose what he called Friday ""concrete practical things...to rebuild trust between communities of color and the police department."" He said he'll implement them however necessary when he's given those recommendations. The events of the past month have contributed to the largest percentage of Americans saying racism is the country's most important problem since 1992, according to a new Gallup poll. It found that 13 percent of Americans chose racism, up from just 1 percent in November. But the president said, overall, the renewed discussion on race has ""been a healthy conversation we've had."" ""You're not going to solve the problem if it's not being talked about,"" he said.","President Barack Obama said there are ""some hidden biases that we all carry around""

"Former President Bill Clinton said that the African American man killed with a chokehold by a white police officer ""didn't deserve to die,"" and that while race relations have improved, Americans have to move beyond harmful preconceptions that are ""almost wired into"" their experience. In an interview with Fusion that aired Monday, a network aimed at younger Latino viewers, Clinton acknowledged that Eric Garner, the man who died by chokehold after police found him illegally selling loose cigarettes on the street, was ""obviously not well, overweight and vulnerable therefore to heart and lung problems"" and that he was ""doing something that was illegal."" But he added: ""He didn't deserve to die because of that."" RELATED: Bill Clinton on protests: 'We have to make people feel that everybody matters again' Clinton has spent much of the past week speaking on the killing of Eric Garner, telling CNN En EspaÃ±ol last Friday that the ""The fundamental problem you have anywhere is when people think their lives and the lives of their children don't matter, they they are somehow disposable, just like a paper napkin after a lunch at a restaurant or something."" ""If we want our freedom to be in deed as well as word in America, we have to make people feel that everybody matters again,"" Clinton said last week. The police officer in the case was not indicted, sparking a new wave of protests following months of unrest surrounding a similar incident involving Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen who was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. That officer was also cleared by a grand jury, and the two incidents have prompted a nationwide discussion surrounding race relations and attitudes in the United States. Clinton said in Monday's interview while Brown's killing ""may not be a crime ... it shows you the divide that exists between the community and the police."" He did say that economic opportunities have improved for minorities, that ""there are more opportunities for people, without regard to race, to be accepted into every business profession and avenue of American life than ever before."" But Clinton also said that there remain ""preconceptions that, when people are scared, are triggered again."" ""And when people like this get killed, the people in their neighborhoods, they feel almost that they're disposable ... like they're not really important, they don't really matter,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Not too long after a man ambushed and killed two police officers sitting in a patrol car in New York City, the finger-pointing started. Ismaaiyl Brinsley walked up to Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos on Saturday in Brooklyn as they sat in their patrol car and shot them in the head, authorities said. Police said he later used the same gun to commit suicide. Former New York Gov. George Pataki and police union officials quickly lashed out at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. The governor accused de Blasio of putting officers' lives at risk because the mayor supported recent protests over the killing of Eric Garner by a New York police officer who was not indicted. At a hospital where the slain officers' bodies were taken, a group of fellow officers turned their backs and faced a wall when de Blasio walked by them on his way to a news conference during which he condemned the slayings. Earlier, officers and New York Fire Department personnel saluted an ambulance carrying the two officers as it drove by. They stood at attention, some with tears rolling down their cheeks. Ex-governor blames mayor . Pataki, a Republican, cast disdain at the Democratic mayor and the U.S. attorney general in a post on Twitter. ""Sickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of Eric Holder and Mayor de Blasio,"" he tweeted. Pataki was referring to de Blasio's and Holder's support for peaceful protests that decried alleged police brutality in the killings of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, two unarmed black men. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Pataki was wrong for making those comments. ""That's a very damaging thing to say,"" Giuliani told CNN on Sunday. ""It's an overreaction. That is not true."" Other mayors have lost officers, Giuliani said, and officers were killed during his term as mayor. He added that his heart went out to Bratton and to de Blasio. Referring to the gunman, the ex-mayor said, ""This sounded like an insane man who was going to commit murder."" Hours before Saturday's attack in New York, suspected gunman Brinsley appeared to have made statements on social media suggesting he planned to kill police and expressing outrage over the deaths of Garner and Brown. Pat Lynch, the head of New York's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has vehemently attacked the mayor before and did so again the day of the shooting. ""There's blood on many hands tonight,"" Lynch said before making reference to the mayor's office. De Blasio did not respond to the denunciations against him, but he described the killing of the officers as an ""assassination."" Holder described it as a ""cowardly attack."" #BlueLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter . Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was joined by other New York borough presidents Sunday as he urged the public to refrain from protesting until the slain officers are buried. ""Blood is on the hands of one individual -- a sick man who did a sick act,"" he said. He urged that the community find ""the correct tone and professionalism"" in the wake of the slayings, adding, ""This is the painful day for all of us. ... We cannot allow anyone to assassinate public safety in this city."" Social media users joined the fray, with many objecting to blaming anyone other than the gunman for the killings. Some turned to hashtags #BlackLivesMatter for Garner and Brown -- and #BlueLivesMatter to show respect and support for police officers. ""Everyone who turned Michael Brown into a saint, the assassination of those cops is on you,"" username @mattcale52 tweeted. Akilah Hughes tweeted that, ""#BlackLivesMatter is a call for justice, not a call for retribution."" ""Do not pin the death of these two NYPD officers on a peaceful movement,"" she posted. David Simpson said supporters should not choose one side or the other. ""#BlackLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter,"" he tweeted. ""Recognize racism, push for justice for all."" Officials weigh in . The murders triggered reactions of condemnation and sadness from across the nation. Barack Obama . ""Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification,"" the President said in a statement. ""The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day -- and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day."" Bill de Blasio . In addition to calling the shootings an ""assassination,"" he said, ""It is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on everything we hold dear."" Eric Holder . ""This cowardly attack underscores the dangers that are routinely faced by those who protect and serve their fellow citizens. Our nation must always honor the valor -- and the sacrifices -- of all law enforcement officers with a steadfast commitment to keeping them safe."" Loretta E. Lynch . Obama's nominee to replace Holder as attorney general is the current U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. She pledged her district's support in the investigation. ""Today, two have fallen, in a stark reminder of the challenges and risks that our law enforcement officers face every day, both in New York City and throughout our nation,"" Lynch said. Michael Brown's family . ""We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot be tolerated. We must work together to bring peace to our communities,"" they said in a statement. The Rev. Al Sharpton . ""Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases.

"The family of a man who picked up a BB gun for sale at an Ohio Walmart and was shot dead by police has filed a federal lawsuit, claiming that the corporation and police are responsible for his death. John Crawford III was black, and his family's lawyers Tuesday mentioned Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Michael Brown as they announced the suit -- evoking cases that have stirred international outrage because the three also were black and killed by police officers. Grand juries chose not to indict officers in those cases, just as they decided not to indict police involved in Crawford's death in Beavercreek. The shooting happened August 5. Crawford was shopping at Walmart and picked up a BB gun that wasn't packaged and had been sitting on the store shelf for two days, the Crawford family's lawyers said Monday. Cops killed man at Walmart, then interrogated girlfriend . Attorney Michael Wright said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers; Beavercreek's police chief; the city of Beavercreek and its Police Department; and Walmart. Wright told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" Tuesday that race might have played a role in the shooting. ""We believe that had Mr. Crawford been white, he may have gotten a little bit more time to respond to the police officers,"" he said. ""These officers came in, saw Mr. Crawford and shot him on sight. They didn't give him the opportunity to live."" Officer with place in local history . The two officers are Sgt. David M. Darkow and Officer Sean C. Williams, who is also ""involved in the only other fatal police shooting in the history of the Beavercreek Police Department,"" according to the lawsuit. The officers and their attorneys couldn't be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Walmart spokesman Brian Nick expressed condolences to Crawford's family and to relatives of a mother who fled the scene of the police shooting with her daughter, had a heart attack and later died. The manner of death for shopper Angela Williams, 37, was ruled a homicide because she died while ""fleeing and running"" from the chaos inside the Walmart, Greene County Coroner's Office chief investigator William Harden told CNN affiliate WHIO. ""Our condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones,"" Walmart's Nick said. ""Out of respect for everyone involved, we believe it's not appropriate to discuss the specifics of this matter, but we can say that our associates acted properly. We take the safety and security of our stores very seriously so that Walmart remains a safe shopping experience for our customers."" In September, an Ohio grand jury decided not to indict the police officers. But Beavercreek City Manager Michael Cornell and police Chief Dennis Evers have requested that the FBI review the case to determine whether there were civil rights violations. The Justice Department is investigating the police shooting. Despite that willingness for a federal investigation, the city of Beavercreek and its Police Department expressed confidence they will prevail in the latest litigation. ""We acknowledge the family's right to bring this action and are confident the trial will be fair and impartial. We believe the evidence will prove that the officer's actions were legally justified,"" the city said in a statement. Ohio's open carry law . The lawsuit asserts Crawford was an innocent shopper whom police gunned down. ""Mr. Crawford never used, loaded or pointed the pellet rifle at anyone, was doing nothing improper or illegal, and never caused any harm or acted in a manner that would cause any reasonable person to believe that he may cause harm,"" the suit said. Williams and Darkow were responding to a 911 call about ""a gentleman walking around with a gun in the store,"" pointing it at people and ""waving it back and forth,"" according to a recording of the call. The suit contends that the two officers ""failed to take steps to assess whether any of the information provided by the 911 caller or dispatcher was accurate before Williams shot and killed Mr. Crawford, though they had an obligation to do so."" Ohio concealed carry laws don't regulate ""open"" care of firearms, so the open carry of firearms is ""a legal activity in Ohio,"" the state's attorney general office says. As such, the lawsuit contends, Crawford ""was doing nothing wrong and in violation of no law or ordinance in the moments leading up to his death"" and ""was doing what people do in stores -- shop."" When the two officers located Crawford, ""he was talking on a cell phone held in his right hand, with no other customers in his vicinity, and with his left side and back visible to the two police officers. Mr. Crawford was holding the Pellet Rifle in his left hand pointed down at the floor,"" the suit contends. Shot in a second . Williams shot and killed Crawford ""approximately one second after Defendant Williams or Darkow first made contact with him,"" the suit said. ""As a result, Mr. Crawford was shot before he even had time to react to the officer's presence, much less to comply with any verbal commands Defendants Williams or Darkow may have made."" The Crawford family is seeking at least $75,000 in compensatory damages and an unstated amount for punitive damages, the suit said. The family alleges, among other things, that the police officers did not use due diligence to determine that Wright wasn't a threat; that the officers didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon; and that Walmart was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf, unpackaged and unsecured, for at least two days, the family's lawyers said Tuesday. The suit also accuses the police chief of failing to properly train and supervise the two officers. Crawford was the father of a baby son, Jayden, born last March, the suit said.","John Crawford III may have gotten the chance to live if he'd been white, attorney says .

"(CNN) -- The contents of your pocket gleam up at you from the Newport, Rhode Island sidewalk like a sarcastic wink. You sit on the curb, surrounded by police cars, cuffs slicing your wrists, passersby whispering. You've told the cops you're an FBI agent. You'd been debriefing your supervising officer two states away at the time they allege you committed the crime. They check your ID what seems like a hundred times. They even look at it upside-down. Yet here you are, still waiting on them to finish checking out your story. You are, of course, black. You've heard folks say, ""If black folks would just take responsibility, stop blaming slavery, maybe they wouldn't be getting arrested and killed in the numbers they are."" But how much more personal responsibility can you take? You grew up without a dad and still became an undercover FBI agent. After the above incident, M. Quentin Williams, author of the upcoming ""A Survival Guide: How Not to Get Killed by the Police,"" went on to become a federal prosecutor, then in-house counsel for the NFL and NBA. How much more responsibility could Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. have taken -- beyond becoming one of the world's pre-eminent intellectuals -- that would have stopped officers arresting him at his own front door? How much more responsibility could President Barack Obama have taken -- beyond making history and achieving policy goals unrealized by his white predecessors -- that would stop some people from portraying him with a bone through his nose and calling him a terrorist? Where was St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch's personal responsibility to say, ""call a prosecutor from the other side of the state to build the case against a local officer?"" Where was the personal responsibility of Officer Daniel Pantaleo to stop choking Eric Garner when he kept saying he couldn't breathe? Why did he arrest him for the finable offense of selling loose cigarettes, or ""loosies?"" It's racism, whether we want to admit it as a society or not, that says: ""It's legal to kill unarmed black men."" The people marching aren't making it up. This is real. I know because I'm married to a black man. A man, who numerous times, has had an officer's gun on him, though he attended Harvard and has never been accused of committing a crime. The impunity with which officers (and even members of the neighborhood watch) can brutalize and kill black people reeks of the past. I can't sleep thinking my mixed-race girls will grow up in a society that values their lives less than mine. Still, I have friends and family who are officers. I see what they sacrifice to serve. I respect them and I need their protection. We have nowhere to go if each side paints the other with a broad and tainted brush. Dialogue is the only way forward. So I spoke to Williams, as well as to a white officer, Graham Campbell, a high school classmate of mine who became an NYPD officer in Harlem. Campbell vouches convincingly for the vast majority of officers: ""In the Academy, my lieutenant said to us: 'Ten percent of you are born to be officers. For 80%, this is a job. Ten percent of you are criminals.' "" Quentin Williams corroborates this: ""Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of cops are good."" He adds a caveat: ""But there are bad cops, like in any other profession. You should be able to indict a bad officer. With video evidence, you (should) get an indictment probably 100% of the time."" ""I don't think he meant to kill Eric Garner,"" Campbell says. ""Guys say they can't breathe all the time, especially if there's a crowd. It's a tactic."" This difference in perception makes me curious: Is there racial tension within the police force itself? Campbell states, ""There's no silent war between races on the job."" Williams parses the matter: A few minority officers ""might put their heads in the sand, but from my experience, a vast majority understand the issues very well"" and they're very concerned. But minority officers have to approach these issues with ""some sensitivity"" for fear of being ""accused of using the 'race card,' "" he said. Campbell admits that occasionally, he would hear casual use of the word ""animals."" He elaborates: ""No matter where you work, you're going to end up resenting that community because you play referee far more often than you end up playing police officer."" He adds: ""There are criminal cops. I wouldn't hesitate to report them: Cops who abuse, cops who steal and do drugs. But a cop who ends up spinning scenes up? I might not want him at my crime scene ... but I'm not going to ask him to be indicted."" But isn't it criminal to lose control to the point of killing an unarmed citizen? Not indicting officers who kill the civilians they've vowed to protect sends a message that they're above the law they've sworn to enforce. To make matters worse, when black people protest injustice, they're further vilified. The night of McCulloch's announcement of the Grand Jury decision, Campbell posted on Facebook that Ferguson dispatch said a white male with a flag bandana had set fire to a police car. Meanwhile, on the news, all I saw were images of black kids walking up to convenience stores with uncertain intent. Campbell acknowledges that the white male could have set fires to frame black protestors. We'll never know. The point is, white people overwhelmingly get the benefit of the doubt from our society, while black people's benefit to society gets doubted. When pressed if he thinks profiling exists, Campbell replies, "" If anything, it looks like white folks get the benefit of much more discretion. If you got locked up, you could have your parents call a high-powered attorney to get you out. ... Whereas if you're locked up in the bullpen with a public defender,"" it's a diferent story. A racial double standard exists in policing practices. According to ProPublica, black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. White America must face how its own prejudices inform whom they perceive as criminals and whom as victims. Campbell nails the heart of where white and black America diverge: ""In these discussions we don't have: 'If I stop a black guy on a drug block because I think he's buying, and he wasn't doing anything, it wounds his soul.' This is me doing my job. I don't think about the impact because it's not an impact I have to live with."" Williams admits that a certain amount of profiling is part of any police work, but holds firm that law enforcement leadership must do more to create an environment of sensitivity to -- and accountability for -- injustice. Meanwhile, the wound to the man's soul, we ignore at our peril. It has a history. It has a future. African-American culture disproportionately constitutes the soul of America. In wounding the souls of black folk, we wound our own. If we don't acknowledge those wounds, and officially atone for the crimes that caused them, we'll keep killing for loosies and putting the victims on trial.

"New York (CNN) -- The man who shot and killed two New York City police officers as they sat in their patrol car had posted angry messages on social media, ranting against the government and police, New York Police Department's Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said Sunday. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, also posted messages of self-loathing and despair and made reference online to Michael Brown and Eric Garner, African-American men who were killed by police. ""I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today. They Take 1 Of Ours, Let's Take 2 of Theirs,"" an Instagram post read, authorities said. Brinsley had a lengthy criminal record. He was arrested 15 times in Georgia for assorted crimes and arrested four times in Ohio, Boyce told reporters Sunday. He was in prison in Georgia between August 2011 and July 2013 for criminal possession of a weapon, Boyce said. Brinsley had an address connected to him in Georgia but that appears to be his sister's home, and they are estranged, Boyce said. The gunman's connection to Brooklyn is that his mother lives there, but they are also estranged, the chief of detectives said. On Saturday afternoon, Brinsley fired four rounds at officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. The officers, who were hit in head, were assigned from their normal downtown Brooklyn beat to an area of the borough with a high crime rate, authorities said. New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton said the officers were shot ""with no warning, no provocation."" Witnesses saw Brinsley walk to the car and assume what they described as a shooting stance. ""They were, quite simply, assassinated,"" Bratton said. At a nearby subway station, Brinsley was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. A message from a teenage son of Ramos' showed the heartbreaking devastation the crime has caused. ""Today is the worst day of my life,"" 13-year-old Jaden Ramos posted on Facebook about the slaying of his father, Rafael Ramos. ""Today I had to say bye to my father,"" the teenager wrote. ""He was (there) for me everyday of my life, he was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer. Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad."" The thin blue line . Family and friends of Ramos spoke to reporters Sunday, expressing support for police and a desire for change. ""We're just hopeful that this tragedy will not be in vain and that we will be able to heed the words of the Ramos family and bring the city together to heal,"" said U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents large sections of Brooklyn. Ramos had just turned 40; Liu had been married two months ago. Both had dreamed of being police officers, Bratton said. ""One of the unfortunate realities of policing is that you put that blue uniform on and you become part of the thin blue line between us and anarchy,"" Bratton said. He sent a memo to NYPD officers about the killings, saying the officers were ""targeted for their uniform, and for the responsibility they embraced: to keep the people of this city safe."" Liu and Ramos ""will be remembered,"" he wrote. ""They will join a line that is too long, a line of partners who served together and made the ultimate sacrifice together."" The memo then named other officers who have lost their lives. ""May God grant Officer Wenjian Liu and Officer Rafael Ramos rest. And to all members of the service, be safe,"" he said. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo directed that all flags on state government buildings in New York City be flown at half-staff. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Bratton met with the families of the victims. ""When a police officer is murdered, it tears at the foundation of our society,"" the mayor said. ""It is an attack on the very concept of decency."" President Barack Obama condemned the shooting, and called Bratton on Sunday to express condolences for the slain officers. ""Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification,"" Obama said in a statement. ""The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day -- and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day."" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the attack ""an unspeakable act of barbarism."" The suspect and his lethal travels . Brinsley arrived in New York from Baltimore but had a home in the Atlanta suburb of Union City, Georgia. Boyce said that there is no indication that Brinsley had any gang ties, and police have found no religious statements on social media accounts that investigators continue to pour through. Before he arrived in Brooklyn by bus, Brinsley had shot and seriously wounded an ex-girlfriend in Baltimore on Saturday morning, Boyce said. Shaneka Nicole Thompson, 29, was shot in the abdomen, Baltimore authorities said Sunday. She is in critical but stable condition at a hospital, authorities told CNN. Investigators were able to talk to her, Boyce said. She said that when Brinsley showed up at her apartment, they argued. Her mother called during that and heard the bickering but the phone hung up, according to Boyce. The first call to 911 came at 5:50 a.m. from a neighbor who heard shots fired. Brinsley later called the mother back and apologized for shooting her daughter, saying it was an accident and that he hoped she lived, Boyce said. Baltimore authorities communicated to New York police Sunday at about 2:10 p.m. when Baltimore County police made a phone call to the 70th Precinct in New York to tell police there that the phone of a suspect wanted in Thompson's shooting was pinging at a location in the 70th Precinct. The two police departments discussed an Instagram post, allegedly by Brinsley, that read, ""I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today."" The posting made reference, police said, to the high-profile deaths of African-Americans Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Police officers killed both men. ""They Take 1 Of Ours, Let's Take 2 of Theirs,"" the post said, according to authorities. The account also displayed a handgun and a message that said it might be the poster's last message. Baltimore County police also faxed a ""wanted"" poster to New York police with information about Brinsley. Records show Brinsley had a lengthy arrest record in Georgia, mostly involving charges of shoplifting and illegal weapons possession, records show. He was also charged with property damage and obstructing a police officer and pleaded guilty to many of the charges, according to police and court records. Reaction: 'This can't happen' The shooting shocked residents in the neighborhood. ""This can't happen. If you mad at somebody, be mad at the person that you are mad at. Now, we have two families that (are) missing somebody for the holidays,"" Shaniqua Pervis told CNN affiliate WABC. ""Where is your humanity? I know it's a war going on and shoutout to Eric Garner's family and everybody else who lost somebody, but you're not at his house, on his lawn. This is two (officers). You don't even know if (they were) good or bad. I don't condone this, and I'm not with it."" The woman was referring to the controversial July death of the unarmed black man after New York police officers on Staten Island wrestled him to the ground, with one of the officers wrapping his arm around Garner's neck in a chokehold. A grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer in the Garner case, as well as a separate grand jury's refusal to indict an officer in a controversial police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, led to nationwide protests against the police. Brown's family condemned Saturday's slayings. ""We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot be tolerated. We must work together to bring peace to our communities,"" they said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the officers' families during this incredibly difficult time."" In a statement, activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said the Garner family was outraged by the police officers' killings. ""Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases,"" the statement said. ""We have stressed at every rally and march that anyone engaged in any violence is an enemy to the pursuit of justice for Eric Garner and Michael Brown."" Tensions between the community and police have heightened around the country since the deaths of Brown and Garner. ""This could not have come at a worse time,"" City Councilman Robert Cornegy told CNN affiliate WPIX.

"(CNN) -- Some years ago I was the municipal prosecutor in a midsize New Jersey town. I had weekly ""night court"" duties, where we handled traffic violations, DUIs and other nonfelonies. I can say without reservation that during the years I worked as a prosecutor, I held the police in the highest regard and greatly trusted them. I felt this way for years after I stopped prosecuting. But those feelings are gone. Don't get me wrong, I don't view the police as the enemy. I simply don't trust them like I once did. I no longer give them the benefit of the doubt, meaning I can now just as easily believe the suspect's version of the facts as the police officers. And I can easily believe allegations of police misconduct. And here's what New York City police union leader Patrick Lynch and others like him in the New York Police Department don't get: I'm not the exception. In fact, my views about police put me in the company of a growing number of Americans. A Gallup poll released a few weeks ago found that 48% of Americans view the police as possessing high or very high levels of honesty and ethics. That number is not only down 6 percentage points from 2013, it's the lowest in almost 20 years. In contrast, 68% of Americans viewed the police as possessing high levels of honesty and ethics in 2001. That's an astounding 20-point drop in 13 years. To me, these falling poll numbers are tied, at least in part, to a case like Eric Garner, the unarmed man placed in a chokehold by a New York officer and who died a short time later. A recent poll found that 57% of Americans believed that the grand jury had made a mistake in failing to indict the officer who had choked Garner, with only 22% agreeing with the grand jury's decision. It's with that 22% of people where Lynch, president of the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, and his compatriots stand. Indeed, after the grand decision was announced a few weeks ago, Lynch made matters worse with two tone-deaf comments. First, he seemingly blamed Garner for his own death with the remark, ""Garner made a choice that day to resist arrest."" He then shockingly added that Garner's death is a ""tragedy for this police officer who has to live with that death."" A tragedy for the police officer?! The police officer is alive. Garner is dead. Yet to Lynch, we should have sympathy for the police officer who most of us believe should be facing criminal charges for homicide. And Lynch has not let up in his apparent efforts to drive a wedge between the public and the New York Police Department. On Saturday night, shortly after we learned of the horrific slayings of two New York police officers at the hands of a man who reportedly said he wanted to avenge the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown, Lynch released one of the most irresponsible statements I've ever heard from a person in his position. Lynch said there's ""blood on many hands"" in the cop killings. First, he blamed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio -- who has in the past been slightly critical of certain of the department's actions -- saying that the ""blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall in the office of the mayor."" (The NYPD's Sergeants Benevolent Association echoed Lynch's sentiment.) Then Lynch blamed the recent protesters who had taken to the streets to denounce the grand jury decision in the Garner case. Just so it's clear, a small number of protesters did -- despicably -- chant, ""What do we want? Dead cops."" But it's outlandish to blame the protesters for the actions of a man with a long criminal record who had shot his girlfriend only hours before killing the police officers. Lynch's comments sounded like a politician using a tragedy to score political points. In fact, former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican who is said to be considering a presidential run in 2016, made comments similar to Lynch's via Twitter, where he blamed de Blasio for the tragedy. Lynch is missing the big picture. Sure, for politicians such as Pataki, pandering to the base is the norm. But the leader of a union that represents more than 34,000 uniformed officers charged with protecting and serving the public needs to be better than offering up red meat to his supporters. Lynch is viewed by many as the spokesman for rank-and-file New York Police Department officers. Consequently, his remarks could result in an even fewer Americans viewing the police in a favorable light. That does not bode well for us a nation. If we collectively view the police as an untrustworthy adversary and not an ally, it undermines the very notion of community-based policing that is the cornerstone to effective policing. The question is: Will Lynch and his supporters change their tune, or will they make matters worse?","When he was a prosecutor, Dean Obeidallah trusted police; like many now, he does not .

"(CNN) -- Six people have died after a garbage truck collided with pedestrians in the center of the Scottish city of Glasgow, police confirmed Monday. Scottish police also promised further updates in a tweet Monday. Speaking to the BBC earlier Monday, Superintendent Stuart Carroll said it appeared the ""bin lorry"" had struck one pedestrian before going up onto the sidewalk and colliding with a number of others. Police said the truck crashed at the Millennium Hotel Glasgow at George Square. Carroll said ""at least seven"" people had been seriously injured. ""The driver has also been taken to hospital where he is receiving treatment,"" Carroll said. ""For now it does not look to be either a criminal or deliberate act,"" he said. Assistant Chief Constable Wayne Mawson said investigations into the circumstances of the ""tragic incident"" were ongoing. ""We can however confirm that this is not a terrorism-related incident,"" he said. Police earlier told CNN the incident was being investigated as a road accident. A Glasgow police spokesperson said the incident occurred just after 2:30 p.m. (9:30 a.m. ET) Monday. Diversions and road closures are in place and police have asked people to avoid the area.

"The point-blank shooting of two New York City police officers this weekend is testing whether Mayor Bill de Blasio's brand of unapologetic liberalism can work in a city that's spent decades under mayors who made law and order a top priority. De Blasio's pledge to reform police practices helped sweep him into office last year. And in recent weeks he's pushed for the right of demonstrators to gather to protest the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two unarmed African-American men, at the hands of white police officers. But critics -- including those in the police force -- are accusing him of fomenting an anti-police fervor that contributed to the killings of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. On Monday, de Blasio tried to reduce tension in the city. ""We have to get everyone to move away from anger and hatred,"" he said during an afternoon press conference. ""If there are differences, we have to address them peacefully. We have to give people faith that their concerns can be heard peacefully across the spectrum and we have to move forward."" He said New York will not ""be the kind of city it was meant to be if there is a division between our police and the community."" ""The police are our protectors and they must be respected as such,"" he added. He said the murders this weekend were ""an attack on all of us"" during luncheon remarks at the Police Athletic League shortly before his afternoon press conference. And the mayor also called for a hiatus from the protests that have gripped the city and the nation, saying the should focus instead on Liu and Ramos' families. ""It's time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time,"" he said. ""Let's accompany these families on their difficult journey. Let's see them through the funerals ... then the debate can begin again."" But during his afternoon press conference, he also pushed back against his critics, calling remarks from the head of the city's police union ""wrong and mistaken."" De Blasio also accused the media of contributing to the atmosphere of tension between police and protesters. ""What are you guys gonna do — are you going to keep dividing us?"" a visibly angry de Blasio asked reporters, asserting that the media had unfairly focused on a few examples of violence that did not reflect the majority of protesters. ""You all are part of this, too,"" he added. President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have spoken out on the killings of Brown and Garner, calling for Americans to open up a dialogue on race and law enforcement and sharing their own experiences with racism. Obama has launched a task force to examine cases where there may be uneven applications of the law and propose fixes. But a startling divide between how white Americans and minorities view the criminal justice system, revealed by a new CNN/ORC poll, underscores the challenge facing both de Blasio and Obama as they struggle to find a solution to broken relationship between the police and the communities they serve. The nationwide poll, conducted largely before Liu and Ramos were shot and released Monday, shows 57 percent of white Americans think none or almost none of the police in their area are prejudiced against blacks. Just a quarter of non-white Americans feel the same. And while 50 percent of white Americans say the criminal justice system treats blacks fairly, only 21 percent of non-white Americans agree. The shooting this weekend prompted police departments from Colorado to Washington, DC, to warn their officers to remain vigilant and watch out for potential copycat violence against them. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said this weekend on CNN that de Blasio had sparked ""intense, anti-police hatred"" with his support for protesters. Patrick Lynch, the head of NYPD's police union, also lashed out at de Blasio, saying that there's blood on the hands of those who have supported the protesters and it ""starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor."" While de Blasio tried to downplay the politics of the situation during a press conference this weekend, Giuliani and others — largely Republicans — have argued his policies are directly to blame. ""It is the right time to talk about [de Blasio's] policies. His policies of allowing protests to get out of control, and of his not emphasizing enough the importance of fatherhood, the importance of education, the importance of an alternative to a public education system that is failing the black children,"" Giuliani, a Republican, said on Fox News this weekend. Giuliani also placed the blame on ""propaganda"" from the President. ""We've had four months of propaganda starting with the President, that everybody should hate the police. I don't care how you want to describe it, that's what those protests are all about,"" Giuliani said. Others took aim at Holder. ""Sickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of #ericholder & #mayordeblasio,"" tweeted former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican. Still, tensions between the police and the city's mayors are nothing new, and indeed haven't yet reached the breaking point they saw under former Mayor David Dinkins, who oversaw — and was unable to control — an all-out riot by police in 1992. Then, much of the criticism from police was the same: ""He never supports us on anything,"" an officer quoted by the New York Times said at the time. New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Monday, however, that his first 10 years in the police force, in 1970, ""were around this type of tension."" Bratton cautioned against politicizing the tragedy, but agreed that the shooting of the two officers this weekend ""was a direct spinoff"" of the recent protests, and that de Blasio has work to do in rebuilding support within the police community. ""I think he has lost [the trust of] some officers,"" Bratton said.","Critics slam Mayor Bill de Blasio for rhetoric, blaming it for inciting violence against police .

"Internet access in Syria was restored Wednesday after a widespread outage that lasted more than 19 hours. Renesys, an Internet-monitoring company, updated a blog post Wednesday saying that Web service was back in the war-torn country. Other Web-monitoring groups said the same thing Wednesday, including Google, whose Transparency Report documents Internet accessibility around the world. Google removed Syria from its list of countries where service disruptions were ongoing. The Syrian government had said earlier it was working to repair the outage -- something opposition activists suspected could be an ominous sign. Internet connections across Syria went down Tuesday night, according to several global monitoring sites. On Wednesday, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said an optic-cable malfunction caused the outage. A repair was under way to restore services ""as soon as possible,"" SANA said, citing communications official Bakr Bakr. Google reported that its services became inaccessible in Syria around 9:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. ET) Tuesday. The Renesys, Akamai and BGPmon Internet tracking companies also reported the loss of Syrian Internet connectivity at that time. ""It seems Syria has largely disappeared from the Internet,"" Dan Hubbard, chief technology officer for Umbrella Security Labs, wrote in a blog post about the apparent outage. For a while, the website for Syria's state-run news agency and several government websites were not accessible. At one hotel in the capital, employees said the Internet was down ""in the hotel and all of Damascus."" Opposition activists said the communications cutoff could be an ominous sign. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said the activist network would put ""all responsibility on regime forces for any violation or massacres against civilians."" Hubbard said Syria has a history of Internet outages. ""Although we can't yet comment on what caused this outage, past incidents were linked to both government-ordered shutdowns and damage to the infrastructure, which included fiber cuts and power outages,"" Hubbard wrote. After a similar situation in November, U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford said Syria had shut down the Internet in the past. ""The Syrian government has been monitoring (the Internet) for years,"" he said. ""They have been using the Internet with Iranian assistance to track opposition activists, arrest and kill them."" ""That is the reason why our nonlethal assistance to the Syrian opposition, we put a special emphasis on communications equipment precisely to help the Syrian people tell the world what is going on inside Syria,"" he said. Technology has become a key weapon used by both sides of Syria's civil war to fight for their cause, with opposition activists using social media to report violence and a group of pro-Syrian government hackers known as the Syrian Electronic Army targeting major news organizations and activists.","Internet access in Syria was restored Wednesday after a widespread outage .

"A district attorney has decided against charges in the case of a police officer who fatally shot a mentally ill man more than a dozen times in Milwaukee. The officer, Christopher Manney, killed Dontre Hamilton during a confrontation in April. The officer says he opened fire when Hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it. Manney has since been fired for not following protocols, but he will not be charged. ""I've come to the conclusion that criminal charges are not appropriate in this case, and I am releasing all of the information related to this investigation so that you, the public, can see all the facts related to this decision,"" Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm told reporters Monday. In a report, he wrote that the officer's use of force was ""justified self-defense and that defense cannot be reasonably overcome to establish a basis to charge Officer Manney with a crime."" Chisholm anticipated that some might be upset with his decision and, in fact, protesters took to the streets Monday night. According to local media, the officer is white; Hamilton was black. ""On a human level, of course it's tragic. Anytime I have to tell a family that I can't bring justice to them when one of their loved ones has died, it's always tragic. It's terrible,"" Chisholm said. ""The reason that our job is unique is our obligation is not to tell people necessarily what they want to hear. We have to follow our ethical obligations and the law, and sometimes that's very difficult ... But it's a privilege to be able to do the job, and we're committed to doing it the right way,"" he told reporters. Following Chisholm's announcement, the U.S. Department of Justice said that it would conduct a federal civil rights review of the case, which comes amid ongoing protests around  race and law enforcement in America. ""There is a lot of media trying to fit this incident into the national conversation, but it is important to note that the individual who was shot was not unarmed.  He was armed with the officer's baton at the time that he was shot,"" said Lt. Mark Stanmeyer of the Milwaukee Police Department. Earlier this year in Ferguson, Missouri, a jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson, a white officer who shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Charges were also not filed in the death of Eric Garner, a black man, who died in Staten Island, New York, after an officer put him in a chokehold.","Dontre Hamilton died during a confrontation in April .

"New York (CNN) -- Amid criticism that he's fanned tensions between the public and police, New York's mayor met with the families of two slain officers on Monday. ""They are in tremendous pain,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, ""and they are worried deeply."" The mayor said speaking with Officer Rafael Ramos' two teenage sons made him think of his own children. ""You have two teenage, good young men, who no longer have a father because of an assassin,"" de Blasio said. ""I told them that I lost my own dad when I was 18, and that as painful and difficult as it is, families come together. People find a way forward,"" he said. ""I also told them that we would be there for them. That the NYPD family would be there for them and the people of New York City and the family of New York would be there for them, and we will be."" Officer Wenjian Liu's family also is devastated, de Blasio said. His parents are mourning the loss of their only child, and his wife of just two months is facing the heartbreaking reality of losing her husband in an instant. De Blasio repeated his calls to put aside debates and protests and focus on the officers' grieving families. ""It was an attack on every single New Yorker and we have to see it as such,"" he said. The slain officers are ""now our family and we will stand by them,"" de Blasio said. ""Our first obligation is to respect these families in mourning."" He also pushed back against his critics, calling remarks from the head of the city's police union ""wrong and mistaken,"" and accusing the media of contributing to the atmosphere of tension between police and protesters. Police investigators told reporters they're trying to piece together where the gunman who ambushed and killed the two officers Saturday was in the hours before the shooting. Officials told reporters Monday there's a roughly two-hour gap in the timeline they've assembled leading up to the shooting, and they asked for the public's help to pinpoint where shooter Ismaaiyl Brinsley was before the incident. Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters that investigators believe the gunman acted alone. So why is it so important to piece together his every move leading up to the shooting? ""We owe it to the families to find out what happened,"" Bratton said. ""That's why we're seeking to build this case up, so we know going forward exactly who talked to this man."" The backlash . Police say Liu and Ramos were sitting in their patrol car in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant on Saturday afternoon when Brinsley ambushed them. Authorities haven't established the gunman's motive, but they've noted that Brinsley, 28, broadcast his plans to kill police on social media. And in some of his posts, investigators have said, he mentioned the cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, African-American men who were killed by police. Brinsley's sister and aunt told CNN affiliate WCBS that he was estranged from them, deeply troubled and suicidal. But the family members said they don't believe the police officers he killed were targeted for what they represented, despite his social media posts before the shooting. ""This has nothing to do with police retaliation,"" said Jalaa'a Brinsley, the gunman's older sister. ""This was a troubled, emotionally troubled, kid. He needed help. He didn't get it."" Since Saturday's shooting, critics have taken aim at de Blasio's comments about the protests surrounding Garner, a 43-year-old who died in July after police in Staten Island placed him in what appeared to be a chokehold. A wave of protests erupted in New York City -- and nationwide -- after the officer involved was not indicted. The head of New York's police union said de Blasio had ""blood on his hands."" And, in the aftermath of Saturday's shootings, video showed officers turning their back on the mayor as he passed them. Others have said that de Blasio should not be blamed, arguing that the gunman is solely responsible for the weekend's bloodshed. Bratton told reporters Monday that tensions between New York mayors and police unions are decades in the making. ""Can you point out to me one mayor that has not been battling with the police unions in the last 50 years? .... So the experience of this mayor, in terms of some cops not liking him, it's nothing new. It's part of life, it's part of politics. And it is what it is. This is New York City. We voice our concerns and we voice our opinions,"" Bratton said. ""So what I suggest is ... that we will engage in dialogue once we get our officers respectfully mourned and buried, and return to dialogue where we can hopefully resolve whatever differences are out there."" 'We cannot take this lightly' But there's one thing New York's mayor said shouldn't wait. ""If you see something on social media that is a threat against a police officer, call 911 immediately,"" de Blasio said. ""We would much rather get too much information than too little."" Online threats against police officers must be taken seriously to stop future attacks, de Blasio said, referring to social media posts by the gunman who killed the officers. ""Once this individual posted on Facebook his intention, anyone who sees that has the obligation to call the police immediately and report it,"" he said. ""We cannot take this lightly."" Investigators have been combing through the gunman's social media posts and looking through his cell phone. Many of his Instagram posts show ""self despair,"" said Robert Boyce, the New York Police Department's chief of detectives. There are also anti-government tirades, he said. Among several thousand images on Brinsley's cell phone, investigators found footage of a recent protest in New York's Union Square Park, Boyce said. In the video, recorded around December 1, ""he is a spectator watching one of the protests,"" Boyce said. New threats . As they grieve the deaths of two of their colleagues, New York police must also deal with a spate of new threats. The department plans to increase security around the New Year's Eve Ball Drop in Times Square as a result of ongoing threats against officers, a law enforcement official said. The NYPD is investigating more than 15 threats to officers posted on various social media platforms, trying to determine whether any are serious or credible, a senior New York City law enforcement officer told CNN. The department's intelligence division continues to monitor social media for threats made to the NYPD. Officials have not released details about any potentially credible threats. But the troubling messages aren't just coming from New York. A Memphis, Tennessee, man has been questioned after allegedly posting threats against the NYPD, CNN affiliate WREG reported. ""Good job. Kill em all I'm on the way to NY now #shootthepolice 2 more going down tomorrow,"" an Instagram post read. The NYPD has already pulled all of its auxiliary officers off the streets in the wake of the killings of the two officers. Auxiliary officers are unarmed volunteer officers who help with traffic control or other minor situations. The victims . As they grapple with the shooting, de Blasio said Ramos' family remains united in their Christian faith, their strong sense of family and their belief in public service. Ramos had been scheduled to graduate later Saturday afternoon from a community-crisis chaplaincy program, according to the Rev. Marcos Miranda, president of the New York State Chaplain Task Force. ""He thought being a chaplain was something he could see himself doing as a full-time ministry when he retired from the NYPD,"" Miranda said. ""You just looked in his eyes and there was kindness all the way around."" A quote on the slain officer's Facebook page says, ""If your way isn't working, try God's way."" A funeral service for Ramos will be held on Saturday at Christ Tabernacle, the church he'd attended for nearly 14 years. A statement on the church's website described him as a family man who loved his wife and two sons and ""always talked about his kids and how well they were doing athletically and academically."" Liu's family is waiting for family to come from China to work out the details of funeral arrangements, Bratton said. In a statement released Monday night, his family said Liu was 12 when his parents emigrated with him in 1994, coming to the United States from Canton, China, in search of a better life. He majored in accounting in college, but he opted for a different path, joining the New York Police Department in 2007. He was proud to serve as an officer, his family said, using his Chinese language skills whenever they were needed. He got married in September and had been looking forward to having his own family. Tears streamed downed family members' faces as they stood before reporters in front of the family's Brooklyn home Monday evening. His widow thanked members of the community for their support and sent condolences to the Ramos family. ""This is a difficult time for both of our families,"" Pei Xia Chen said, ""but we will stand together and get through this together."" Shimon Prokupecz reported from New York; Catherine E.

"(CNN) -- A Missouri police officer shot and killed a teenager Tuesday night in Berkeley, Missouri, just 2 miles from the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, where Michael Brown was killed by police, an event that set off protests across the country. But even though both cases involve white officers and black teens, Berkley's mayor said the incidents are not the same. Surveillance video appears to show a person -- identified by police and his family as Antonio Martin, 18 -- pointing a gun at an officer in a gas station parking lot in Berkeley right before the officer fatally shot the teen, Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins told reporters Wednesday. St. Louis County Police released on YouTube videos from three different angles that captured parts of the scene. The shooting led to a tense couple of hours at the station, where scuffles with police broke out -- and what appeared to be lit fireworks were thrown -- as scores of people gathered to see what happened in an area still emotional over the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown. But Hoskins, who is black, said that this shooting cannot be likened to Brown's death, in part because unlike the Ferguson case, this one was captured on video and allegedly involves an armed teen. ""We reviewed the video and it appears that there was a gun pointed at the officer before the officer fired,"" Hoskins said. It ""does not appear that the police officer initiated"" the incident, he said. Hoskins promised a thorough investigation. ""I will not tolerate brutality of any policeman on our citizens,"" Hoskins told CNN. He added that people can ""rest assured that I will investigate this independently and make a complete report to the community."" Gov. Jay Nixon issued a brief statement saying, ""The events in Berkeley are a reminder that law enforcement officers have a difficult, and often dangerous, job in protecting themselves and law-abiding citizens."" A small group of protesters marched along some roads, including a highway, on Wednesday night, with some help from police. ""Police are actually blocking the intersections for the protesters,"" St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Nicholas J.C. Pistor tweeted. Still, six to eight protesters were nevertheless arrested for blocking off part of I-170 in Berkeley, CNN affiliate KMOV reported. Martin faced a series of criminal charges over the past 15 months according to KMOV, including assault, armed robbery, unlawful use of a weapon, armed criminal action and stealing. The station showed Martin's tearful mother Toni Martin saying her son was ""trying to get his life back together."" Police: Officer was investigating alleged theft . County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting was tragic, but stressed the teen pointed a gun ""straight out"" at the officer, who fired in self-defense. ""I understand the emotions ... but I think we need to understand the context of what happens ... with these types of situations,"" Belmar, whose department is investigating the shooting, told reporters. Belmar said the officer, a 34-year-old, six-year Berkeley police veteran, was responding to a report of a theft when he pulled into the parking lot of a Mobil gas station in Berkeley shortly before 11:15 p.m. He left his cruiser and talked to two men in the lot. Eventually, as the officer stood by the driver's side tire of his cruiser, one of the men backed away from the cruiser's passenger side headlight, then stepped forward again pointing a gun at the officer, Belmar said. The officer, whom police did not name, lost balance and fell as he moved back in reaction, but managed to fire what investigators believe were three shots, hitting the gunman at least once, Belmar said. The slain teen is not believed to have fired his weapon, a loaded 9 mm handgun that police recovered at the scene, Belmar said. Police later released a photo of the weapon. Meanwhile, there was a shooting in St. Louis on Wednesday. CNN affiliate KMOV reported one person was shot to death and three were in critical condition. No other details were immediately available. Surveillance video, but body camera wasn't worn . In the Martin case, video released by authorities showed a second man nearby who fled when the shooting occurred. Authorities are looking to interview him. Martin's father, Jerome Green, said his son had indicated he was going out to meet his girlfriend and had not mentioned any other person who might be with them. ""He was supposed to come home,"" Green said. ""We're getting ready for the holiday; everyone wanted to see him. My grandmother hadn't seen him for a while."" The officer involved was given a body camera before he left for patrol, but he wasn't wearing it during the shooting, possibly because he was distracted when a supervisor gave it to him earlier Tuesday, Belmar said. Hoskins said this didn't bother him, in part because the city, with three cameras for its 31 officers, had just started training officers to use them. The cruiser's dashboard camera also wasn't recording, because the car's emergency lights hadn't been activated, Belmar said. The officer will be placed on administrative leave until the investigation is completed. Green said Martin lived with his parents, brother and sister. Protest, scuffle . Protesters late Tuesday and early Wednesday gathered around an ethnically diverse group of dozens of police officers, who stood between them and the scene. People in the crowd screamed at police. Others spoke more calmly. What looked like a firework exploded near a gas pump, scattering people and temporarily filling the area with thick, white smoke, video from CNN affiliate KMOV showed. Four people were arrested on suspicion of assaulting officers, Belmar said. One police officer was sent to an emergency room after injuring himself while trying to get away from the firework, Belmar said. Another officer was treated at a hospital after being hit in the head with a rock or a brick, Belmar said. St. Louis Post-Dispatch photographer David Carson said some of the protesters damaged police cars. CNN showed images of one squad car with a large dent in its side. KMOV video showed a white plume rising at another location down the street. Belmar said someone had tried to set a fire at a nearby store, but someone extinguished it. Before sunup, protesters thinned out, and those remaining stood calmly behind police tape. Tuesday's incident came about a month after a St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting Michael Brown on August 9. Authorities said Brown, who was black, wasn't armed at the time, but that he tried to take Wilson's gun while the officer was in his vehicle during an encounter in Ferguson. Some witness accounts said Wilson left his car and eventually fired while Brown, 18, had his hands up in surrender, but others disputed this. Police said Wilson fired in self-defense as Brown charged him. Berkeley is a city of about 8,000 people flanked by St. Louis International Airport to the west and Ferguson to the east. CNN's John Branch, Sara Ganim, George Howell and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Berkeley police arrest 6-8 protestors for blocking highway .

"(CNN) -- As the country continues to debate police accountability and the all-too-routine killing of unarmed black men by white law enforcement, it's imperative to understand that this issue is not just about black people and white people. In fact, despite the available statistical evidence, most people don't know that Native Americans are most likely to be killed by police, compared with other racial groups. Native Americans make up about 0.8% of the population, yet account for 1.9% of police killings. When Native Americans are shot and killed by law enforcement, there's rarely much news coverage of those incidents. There are no outcries from any community other than our own. There are no white or black faces rallying around us, marching with us, protesting with us over this injustice. Why? Because we are a forgotten people. Take Mah-hi-vist Goodblanket, an 18-year-old Cheyenne and Arapaho youth, who died on December 21, 2013, after being shot seven times by two sheriff's deputies in Oklahoma. The two Custer County deputies alleged that Goodblanket had a knife during an incident at his parents' home in the city of Clinton. Custer County Sheriff's spokesman Bruce Peoples said Goodblanket threw a knife at the deputies and then attacked with another knife. They tried a Taser on him, which had no effect. But Goodblanket's girlfriend, Naomi Barron, who was present when he was killed, said in a statement that Goodblanket had no weapons when the two white deputies opened fire. ""He [had] his arms up and his hands were free ... he had no weapons,"" she said. Goodblanket was diagnosed in ninth grade with Oppositional Defiant Disorder -- a malady affecting 20% of boys. His mother, Melissa, said he experienced an episode when he thought that his girlfriend was breaking up with him that fateful night. The attorney for the Goodblanket family, Ray Wall, said the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation has refused to release the police report regarding the incident. ""Withholding an official police report ... I think that's a violation of the Freedom of Information Act,"" Wall told me when I reached out to him. Goodblanket's mother, Melissa, said she can't comprehend why mainstream media does not report on the killings of unarmed Native Americans, and why the killing of her son has failed to spark a national response. ""Our 18-year-old son was murdered -- [shot] seven times, once in the back of the head,"" she said. ""This [incident] in itself should initiate an outrage among those who value life."" But the outrage isn't to be found -- at least not outside of Native American communities. What's hard to believe is that the two white deputies both received the Medal of Honor and one received the Purple Heart by his department months after Goodblanket's death. On the Custer County Sheriff's Office Facebook page, a post said the awards were in ""recognition of their performance above and beyond the call of duty while disregarding their own personal safety and exhibiting exceptional courage in a life threatening situation, stemming from a domestic call they responded to in December of 2013 ..."" It is notable that medals were given to the two white deputies in a county named for the infamous murderer and Indian fighter George Armstrong Custer no less. Imagine if Darren Wilson or Daniel Pantaleo received commendations associated with the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. There would be protests dwarfing any that have occurred to date. But giving out medals after the killing of a Native American? That doesn't seem to bother anyone but Native Americans. History provides various unjust examples. Just think of the 20 U.S. cavalrymen who were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor after they indiscriminately murdered an estimated 300 Lakota -- 200 of whom were women and children -- during the Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29, 1890. Those medals have yet to be rescinded. Could it be that Hollywood and pop culture have made dead Indians and the killing of the ""savages"" too commonplace for people to flinch? Many old Western movies from Hollywood didn't portray Native Americans in a positive light. Contemporary designers such as Ralph Lauren continue to sell clothes with images of dead Indians emblazoned on them. We've all seem them -- it's the image of a skull donning a feather headdress. There's another incident recently that outraged the Native American community. On October 4 in Pierre, South Dakota, four officers surrounded an irate 70-pound Sicangu Lakota girl and tased her after concern that she would harm herself with a knife. Though this outrageous incident was covered by CNN and other networks, the killing of Goodblanket and many other Native Americans who've died at the hands of law enforcement remains unspoken. Is the message here that geography matters in cases of injustice and oppression? Had Mah-hi-vist Goodblanket been killed in a major city rather than in Clinton, Oklahoma, would the country have rallied in protest to his brutal death? After a grand jury in Staten Island, New York, failed to indict Pantaleo, the white police officer who killed Garner, an unarmed black man, the hashtag #CrimingWhileWhite immediately grew in popularity. Utilizing the hashtag, users compared instances of white people receiving little or no punishments for crimes they had committed, whereas African-Americans were dealt harshly disproportionate sentences for theirs. Yet some people want to claim that we've grown much as a nation. Really? On the day when white law enforcement officers are indicted for the killing of unarmed black men, and on the day when white men stop receiving medals associated with the killing of Native Americans, then I will say we've grown as a nation, but only a little. We will still have a long way to go.","Simon Moya-Smith: Native Americans are more likely to be killed by police .

The attacker detonated explosives near Awakening Council members in al-Madaan, a town roughly 20 kilometers southeast of Baghdad, as they were collecting their monthly paychecks at the council's headquarters. The Awakening Councils are predominantly made up of Sunni Arab fighters in Iraq who turned against al Qaeda in late 2006. The U.S.-backed movement is credited as being one of the main factors that contributed to a drop in violence across Iraq. But council members have become targets for jihadists, notably the Sunni extremist group ISIS, which has seized key areas of Iraqi territory this year. The majority of the casualties in the al-Madaan attack were reported to be Awakening Council members. Fifty-six people were wounded in the bombing, police said.","Fifty-six people are wounded by the bombing, police say .

"Mikhail Kalashnikov, the Russian gun designer whose AK-47 rifle became the weapon of choice for many national armies and guerrillas around the world, died Monday, the Kremlin announced on its website. He was 94. Kalashnikov designed his first machine gun in 1942 after suffering injuries as a tank commander for the Soviet Union's Red Army during World War II, but it wasn't until 1947 -- after years of tweaks -- that the AK-47 was introduced for Soviet military service. The weapon, recognizable by its banana-shaped ammunition magazine, became known for its simple effectiveness.  It was easy to use and maintain, and it was reliable in extreme conditions, be they hot, cold, wet or sandy. From the early 1950s, it became the standard weapon for Soviet and Warsaw Pact countries, according to IHS Jane's. The gun also proved popular with paramilitary groups: It was so successful in Mozambique's successful rebel movement of the 1960s and 1970s that its image appears in the national flag. Russia stopped producing AK-47 models in the late 1960s, but production of variants continued there and in other countries. The Guinness World Records book recognized the AK-47 -- AK being a Russian acronym for ""Kalashnikov's machine gun"" and 47 standing for its debut year -- as the world's most common machine gun. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday ""expressed his deepest condolences to the family of Mikhail Kalashnikov in connection with his death,"" a post on the Kremlin's website read. In 2009, Kalashnikov told CNN that two main qualities described the AK-47: simplicity and reliability. ""It is very important because a soldier doesn't have university degrees,"" he said. ""He needs a simple and reliable weapon. Just as an academic, for that matter, in a combat situation. There's simply no time to figure how to operate a complicated weapon and press many buttons when the enemy is advancing on you."" He said the question he hated most was whether he felt sorry about the hundreds of thousands of people that were killed as a result of his invention. He had a standard answer: . ""I've designed my weapon to defend the borders of our Fatherland, and let it continue to serve this purpose."" In 2011, Izhmash, the Russian manufacturer of the AK-47 family of weapons, said it was abandoning the design in favor of a new one for its next-generation assault rifles. Kalashnikov's 90th birthday, in November 2009, was celebrated in Russia nearly like a national holiday. In a televised Kremlin ceremony, then-President Dmitry Medvedev decorated him with the country's highest order, the Hero of Russia.","Mikhail Kalashnikov developed AK-47 after serving as Soviet tank commander in World War II .

"At least 63 people have been killed in a series of attacks by tribal militants in India's remote northeastern state of Assam, a police official said Wednesday. The attacks by fighters from the Bodo tribe took place Tuesday, Assam Police Inspector-General S.N. Singh told CNN. The Bodo insurgents -- apparently angry over a recent police crackdown that led to several arrests and the seizure of weapons -- targeted members of another tribal community, said Khagen Sarma, the state police chief. India's impoverished northeast region has a high concentration of extremist groups from different backgrounds with conflicting ethnic and political interests. Members of the Bodo tribe, an indigenous group, have fought for decades for political autonomy. They also have long-standing tensions with Muslim settlers in Assam. But in this case, they attacked members of another tribal community, police said. Sarma didn't provide the name of the tribespeople who were targeted, but called them ""soft targets."" He said the Bodo fighters used guns in the attacks. Authorities have ordered a curfew in areas targeted by the extremists, police said. Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh is expected to visit Assam on Wednesday to review the situation, his spokesman K.S. Dhatwalia said. Dozens of people were killed in ethnic violence involving Bodo tribe members and Muslim migrants in 2012. The unrest, in which villages were burned down, displaced hundreds of thousands of people.","Bodo militants target members of another tribe in Assam state, police say .

"A rookie police officer who was answering a domestic violence call has died from gunshot wounds, the Flagstaff, Arizona, Police Department said Saturday. Officer Tyler Stewart, 24, was shot several times in a residential area and died at a hospital, officials said. The gunman apparently killed himself, police said. ""We are a very close-knit organization, and know that all members of the Flagstaff Police Department are grieving at this time,"" Chief Kevin Treadway said. A news release said that Stewart was trying to make contact with the gunman, who was the suspect in a domestic violence investigation, when he was shot Saturday afternoon. There were no other details released. ""It is heartbreaking to lose one of our officers. We collectively mourn for his family and the entire department,"" Mayor Jerry Nabours said.

"(CNN)The mother of the man who killed two New York police officers has spoken out, apologizing for the horror her son Ismaaiyl Brinsley caused before taking his own life. ""Ismaaiyl was a very troubled young man whose life was in turmoil and spiraling out of control,"" Shakuwra Dabre said in a statement to CNN affiliate WABC. ""We were estranged for a few years, with occasional contact. I am deeply sorry for the loss of the two innocent men who were killed, and offer my sincerest condolences to their families."" In an interview with the New York Daily News, Dabre said she was ""horrified"" when she found out what her son had done. ""And please accept my deepest condolences, sincerely. As a mother now I hurt for the loss of my son. Just like they're hurting for the loss of their sons,"" she said. The families of police officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos are ""suffering unspeakable pain,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. The two men were shot and killed in their car while on duty. ""Our first obligation is to stand by them in every way we can. And I call upon everyone to focus on these families in these next days."" Lucy Ramos, aunt of Rafael Ramos, thanked ""all those who have shared their sympathy and support."" Speaking Sunday night, she said her nephew "" will always be loved and missed by many. I hope and pray that we can reflect on this tragic loss of lives that have occurred so that we can move forward and find an amicable path to a peaceful co-existence."" Outside Liu's home Monday evening, his widow thanked members of the community for their support and sent condolences to the Ramos family.  ""This is a difficult time for both of our families,"" Pei Xia Chen said, ""but we will stand together and get through this together."" The two had just been married in September. Brinsley had a long rap sheet and struggled with mental illness. In a 2011 hearing in Cobb County, Georgia, he pleaded guilty to theft, property damage, possession of a firearm by a felon and discharging a gun near a public street after he used a stolen .25-caliber handgun to fire into a gold Chevy Malibu. When asked by a judge at the hearing whether he'd ever been a patient in a mental institution or under the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist, he answered yes, according to court documents. He had an extensive criminal record, including at least 19 arrests, a two-year prison term and several stints in Georgia jails, said New York Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce. Brinsley comes from a Muslim family. Relatives said he ""has never expressed any radicalization,"" Boyce said. Brinsley's aunt and sister told CNN affiliate WCBS that the family struggled to understand why he was set free after so many run-ins with the law. ""They kept releasing him into the streets,"" Jalaa'a Brinsley said, ""so isn't that a problem that the justice system should be asking, not us?"" Authorities are investigating how Brinsley got the gun he used in the attack. A man purchased the handgun at a Georgia pawn shop in 1996, when Brinsley was 9. Investigators said Brinsley's mother described her son as ""very often violent,"" following ""a very troubled childhood."" He had tried to commit suicide, she told them, according to Boyce.","Police killer's mother: 'I am deeply sorry'

"Cleveland police have slammed Cleveland Browns player Andrew Hawkins for wearing a T-shirt calling for justice in the police shooting of Tamir Rice during a warm-up before Sunday's NFL game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Browns receiver's shirt read ""Justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford III"" when he walked out onto the field before the game. Tamir, 12, was fatally shot in November by a Cleveland police officer, while police shot and killed John Crawford III, 22, in a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio, in August. Jeffrey Follmer, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, criticized Hawkins' on-field protest. ""It's pretty pathetic when athletes think they know the law.  They should stick to what they do best on the field,"" Follmer told CNN in a statement. ""The Cleveland Police protect and serve Browns stadium,"" he said. ""The Browns organization owes us an apology."" Medical examiners ruled Friday that Tamir's death was a homicide. Authorities said the officer who shot him mistook the child's air gun for a real firearm. Tamir was pointing a pellet gun at people outside a recreation center before he was shot, police said. A witness called 911 to say that a black male -- ""probably a juvenile"" -- was pointing ""a pistol"" at people but added twice that the gun was ""probably"" fake. Two officers arrived in a police car. Within two seconds of exiting the car, Officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir, and the boy died the next day, police said. Police have said that Loehmann opened fire after Tamir reached for the gun in his waistband and that an orange tip indicating the gun was a toy had been removed. Follmer described the shooting of a 12-year-old as ""unfortunate."" ""But the facts are, that he appeared to be a 20-year-old male. In the eyes of a Cleveland police officer his physical appearance exceeded Andrew Hawkins' profile,"" Follmer said. He noted that the Browns player was 5 feet 7 inches and weighed 170 pounds, compared to Tamir's 5 feet 7 inches and 195 pounds. The Cleveland Browns' vice president of communications, Peter John-Baptiste, said the NFL team has ""great respect"" for the work of the Cleveland police. ""We also respect our players' rights to project their support and bring awareness to issues that are important to them if done so in a responsible manner,"" he said. In September, a grand jury decided not to indict police officers in Crawford's shooting death. But Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said the U.S. Justice Department would review the Cincinnati resident's shooting. Crawford was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Beavercreek on August 5 while carrying an air rifle through the store. Police responded to the scene after a witness called 911 and told dispatchers that Crawford was walking around with a rifle and ""waving it back and forth."" According to police, when officers arrived, Crawford did not comply with their commands to drop his weapon. He was shot twice, once in the elbow and once in the torso, the prosecutor said, and died shortly after being transported to a nearby hospital. The police criticism of Hawkins in Cleveland followed a similar controversy involving St. Louis Rams players over the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The St. Louis Police Officers Association said it was ""profoundly disappointed"" after five Rams players raised their hands before a November 30 game in solidarity with protesters upset about Brown's death.","Cleveland Browns receiver Andrew Hawkins wears a protest T-shirt before game .

"New York (CNN)Nine men have been arrested in connection with alleged threats made toward New York police since Saturday afternoon, when two NYPD officers were shot in the head from behind while sitting in their patrol car, authorities said. Police said this week that they have assessed hundreds of online postings and calls to 911 and pressed the public to continue to report any suspicious activity. ""All threats against members of the NYPD are taken seriously and are investigated immediately to determine the credibility and origin of the information,"" authorities said Wednesday. The two latest arrests were announced Friday. In one case, a man walked into the 28th precinct, approached a desk and harassed and threatened officers before being apprehended, police said. He faces charges of assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, obstructing government administration, criminal trespassing, disorderly conduct and harassment. In another case, a man noticed an off-duty officer on the street wearing part of his uniform under his jacket, police said. Authorities said the man verbally threatened the officer and made a firearm gesture with his hands. The off-duty officer called 911, and the suspect fled. He was later found sleeping in the stairwell of a building nearby. The arrests come as an investigation continues into Ismaaiyl Brinsley, the 28-year-old who police say shot Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in Brooklyn. Hours before the officers were shot, Brinsley apparently posted on his Instagram account: ""I'm putting wings on pigs today ... they take one of ours, let's take two of theirs."" Brinsley committed suicide after shooting the officers, police said. Among the other arrests this week, a 26-year-old allegedly posted pictures of weapons on his Facebook page along with threats to kill police officers, NYPD spokeswoman Sophia Mason said. The man's Facebook post indicated that he wanted to kill two police officers, NYPD Detective Annette Markowski said. He was charged with making terroristic threats. Opinion: Dark times in a divided NYC . A 41-year-old also was arrested Wednesday on charges of aggravated harassment and making terroristic threats after he allegedly called into the 84th precinct -- where Liu and Ramos had been stationed -- and, requesting to speak to Ramos, asked whether the bullets had been removed from the dead officer's head so ""he could kill more cops,"" Mason said. NYC mayor facing tensions further strained by police shootings . Police killer's mother speaks . Of the arrests, police said, at least three stemmed from postings made on social media, and at least two came from misdemeanor charges of false report incident, in which the suspects allegedly called 911 reporting threats made by a third party that were later debunked. One arrest was made after the suspect phoned in a direct threat to 911. And on Wednesday, a man was arrested on weapons, drug and harassment charges after he was overheard threatening to kill cops while talking on his cell phone inside a bank in Queens, according to the NYPD. That man is accused of saying on the phone that he was going to kill a cop, and that Brinsley should have killed white police officers, according to a criminal complaint filed in court. The complaint says that when police interviewed the suspect, he elaborated that two white officers should have been killed ""if the guy really wanted to send a message."" In a tweet Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio thanked the police department and the civilian who saw something suspicious and acted: .

"New Year's festivities in China's most populous city were cut short Wednesday after a stampede left at least 35 people dead and dozens injured. Posts on Twitter and China's Weibo social network described a chaotic scene and rescue efforts along the Shanghai riverfront. Photos showed large crowds packing a street near the river and emergency medical workers treating people on the ground. The stampede broke out around 11:35 p.m. Wednesday along the city's riverfront, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. At least 42 people were injured, Xinhua reported. Authorities are investigating the cause, Xinhua said. A witness told the government-run news agency that people started scrambling after coupons that looked like dollar bills were thrown from the third floor of a building. Many of the dead were young students, CCTV America reported, citing Shanghai rescue authorities. Video from the Reuters news agency showed people sobbing in a hospital waiting room. One woman told CCTV they'd been waiting for hours for information about their loved ones. The promenade in the area known as the Bund along the Huangpu River is a popular spot for New Year's Eve festivities in Shanghai. But last week, Shanghai Daily reported that local officials had called off a popular New Year's Eve light show there, citing police concerns over crowd control. Last year, the event drew nearly 300,000 people and ""dispersing the crowd became a massive administrative headache,"" the newspaper said. Scaled-back celebrations had been planned in several parts of the city instead, according to the newspaper. Officials canceled another New Year's celebration late Wednesday in front of Beijing's tallest skyscraper, citing safety concerns. Even with the light show and official countdown called off, many revelers remained at the location and had their own countdown there.","Witness tells Xinhua people were scrambling for dollar-shaped coupons .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)At least 10 people, including four Somali soldiers, were killed in an attack by Al-Shabaab forces on an army checkpoint near Baidoa, and two other people were killed Friday in bomb attacks in the country, officials said. Col. Mahad Abdirahman, the police chief of Bay province, told CNN that heavily armed Al-Shabaab militants in fighting vehicles attacked Isku-Darka military checkpoint Friday morning, sparking an hourlong, close-quarters gun battle in which six militants were killed, along with the four government soldiers. ""Somali government troops managed to resist and push back the militants from the area,"" Abdirahman said. Friday afternoon, a roadside bomb targeted a bus carrying Kenyan teachers in Galkayo, killing a bodyguard and wounding 10 other people, six of them Kenyans, according to Ahmed Muse, a deputy governor who spoke to CNN by telephone. Muse blamed the attack on Al-Shabaab, a Somalia-based, al Qaeda-linked group whose goal is to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state. The Kenyans are high school teachers in the city, in central Somalia 750 kilometers (470 miles) northeast of the capital city, Mogadishu. Golkayo is under the control of Somalia's semi-autonomous Puntland state. The wounded were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. In Mogadishu, a travel agency officer was killed when a bomb hidden under his car's seat exploded Friday, according to Capt. Mohamed Dahir, a Somali police officer.

"(CNN)A man described by his family as ""depressed and overly emotional"" is suspected of killing eight people before taking his own life, police in Edmonton, Alberta, said Tuesday at a press conference. Seven of the victims, including two children, were found inside a house in north Edmonton, said Edmonton Police Chief Ron Knecht. ""This series of events are not believed to be random acts and there is no risk to the broader public,"" he said. ""These events do not appear to be gang related but rather tragic incidents of domestic violence."" This is the worst mass violence in Edmonton, a city of about 812,000 people in the western Canada province of Alberta, since six people were killed in 1956, Knecht said. Knecht said none of the victims have been identified, but all are connected. Knecht said officers first went to a residence in southwest Edmonton about 7 p.m. Monday after receiving a weapons complaint. ""It is alleged a male entered a private residence, discharged a firearm and fled,"" he said. Inside the house, officers found a dead middle-aged woman. About 8:30 p.m. Monday, police received a call asking them to check on a man at a house in north Edmonton, Knecht said. ""According to the family, the male seemed depressed and overly emotional,"" Knecht said. ""The family was concerned the male might be suicidal."" Police didn't receive a response when they went to the house and noticed nothing suspicious, the chief said. Around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, police received more information and returned to the house in north Edmonton. Inside, they found seven people dead: three adult women, two adult males, a male child and a female child, Knecht said. Knecht said police were told at 2:20 a.m. Tuesday that a black SUV connected to the first killing had been seen near a restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan, about 20 miles from Edmonton. Police surrounded the business and determined at 8:45 a.m. that a man inside the restaurant was dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Knecht said. Police said he is the man whose family had been worried about his welfare the night before. ""We are not looking for other suspects,"" Knecht said. Alberta Premier Jim Prentice said, ""We trust that the police agencies' investigations will help provide answers as we struggle to understand this tragic turn of events.

"(CNN)The family of a sword-carrying man who was killed in September has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Saratoga Springs, Utah, and the two officers who shot him. Darrien Hunt, 22, was shot to death while carrying a 40-inch samurai-type sword. Prosecutors said that Hunt ""lunged"" at two officers, Cpl. Matt Schauerhamer and Officer Nicholas Judson and their actions were reasonable. The medical examiner's autopsy report determined Hunt was shot six times, once in the back. The lawsuit alleges that under the Second Amendment, Hunt had a right to carry the sword and the two officers did not have a right to demand that he surrender. The suit contends that Hunt was shot while he was fleeing, that police used excessive force and that the officers' actions ""manifested malicious, reckless, and callous indifference to the rights and very life of Darrien Hunt."" ""They demanded that he give up his sword -- they had no right to do that. He was causing no harm,"" family attorney Robert Sykes said. ""They provoked an incident with this peaceful man."" At a press conference on Friday, Sykes said the family will ask for more than $2 million in damages. Police and prosecutors say that their actions were justified. And they have rejected claims of racial profiling. The officers responded to a report of a ""suspicious individual walking around a local business with a 'samurai-type' sword,"" Chief Deputy Tim Taylor of the prosecutor's office said in a statement. Hunt was speaking with the police officers and was calm and nonconfrontational, according to Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman. He then ""abruptly and without any apparent provocation withdrew the sword from its sheath and immediately swung or stabbed it toward least one of the officers,"" Buhman said. In November, Buhman called the use of deadly force ""reasonable"" and said that no criminal prosecution would be brought against the officers. ""Preliminary evidence suggests that Mr. Hunt brandished the sword and lunged toward the officers with the sword, at which time Mr. Hunt was shot,"" Taylor said. CNN reached out to an attorney for the city, but did not receive an immediate response Friday. Hunt's mother, Susan, told CNN affiliate KSL her son was killed because he was black. ""No white boy with a little sword would they shoot while he's running away,"" she said.

"As Pakistan started three days of national mourning Wednesday, the Taliban said they targeted a school that mostly admits soldiers' children because the students aspired to follow in their fathers' footsteps and target militants. Terrorists ambushed the school in Peshawar on Tuesday, explosives strapped to their bodies, and burst into an auditorium filled with students taking exams. They sprayed bullets rapidly, killing 145 people. Of those, 132 were children, authorities said. In an email, the terror group warned Muslims to avoid places with military ties, saying it attacked the school to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by soldiers in tribal areas. It accused the students at the army school of ""following the path of their fathers and brothers to take part in the fight against the tribesmen"" nationwide. The Army Public School and Degree College is home to about 1,100 students and staff, most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar. The public school admits children whose parents are in the military, but its classes are not restricted to future soldiers. A day after the massacre, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted a moratorium on the death penalty for terrorism cases. Who are the Pakistani Taliban? 'Under the benches ... kill them' Student Ahmed Faraz, 14, recalled the moment the terrorists struck. He was in the auditorium when about five people burst in through a back door and started firing. "" 'God is great,' "" the militants shouted as they roared through the hallways, Ahmed said. They sought out terrified children. "" 'A lot of the children are under the benches,' "" a Pakistan Taliban member said, according to Ahmed. "" 'Kill them.' "" The ninth-grader got shot in his left shoulder and lay under a bench. ""My shoulder was peeking out of the bench,"" Ahmed recalled. ""They went into another room, (and when) I ran to the exit, I fell."" Seventh-grader Mohammad Bilal said he was sitting outside his classroom taking a math test when the gunfire erupted. He fell into bushes before running to the school's gates to safety. Students, teachers recount the horror they saw . Children drenched in blood . Pakistani troops eventually pushed through the buildings, room by room, and confined the attackers to four buildings. They found children drenched in blood. Some of the bodies lay on top of others. ""Even the children are dying on the frontline in the war against terror,"" said Khawaja Asif, the defense minister. ""The smaller the coffin, the heavier it is to carry."" By the time the siege ended in the evening, military officials said all seven militants were dead. It's unclear whether they were killed by soldiers or they detonated their explosives. The casualty tolls don't include the terrorists. The ambush at Army Public School and Degree College left more than 100 injured, many with gunshot wounds, according to Mushtaq Ghani, a spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It started with a ruse . The nightmare began in late morning, when a car exploded behind the school. Pakistani authorities said the blast was a ruse to divert security guards' attention. Gunmen got over the walls and walked through where students in grades eight, nine and 10 have classes. The militants came in with enough ammunition and other supplies to last for days and were not expecting to come out alive, a Pakistani military official said. Most of those killed were between the ages of 12 and 16, said Pervez Khattak, chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is the capital. Some adults were also targeted, including a 28-year-old office assistant who was shot and burned alive, police official Faisal Shehzad said. Goal was to kill . Pakistani authorities said the attackers' goal was to kill, not take captives. While lifting a moratorium on the death penalty in terror cases, the Prime Minister expressed frustration about failed talks. ""We tried dialogue with these militants, we reopened the door to talks,"" Sharif said. ""It was unsuccessful ... there was no other option than to engage in an operation against these people."" He did not mention any specific terror groups. But the Pakistan Taliban and the government  have been involved in peace talks in the past. Pakistan  released 19 Taliban noncombatants in a goodwill gesture, but talks broke down after a wave of militant attacks. Violent past . Pakistan has seen plenty of violence, much of it involving militants targeting restive regions in northwest Pakistan along the border with Afghanistan. It is the home base of the  Pakistan Taliban, known as the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan or TTP, which seeks to enforce its conservative version of Islam in Pakistan. The group has battled Pakistani troops and attacked civilians, including in Peshawar, an ancient city of more than 3 million people. And the Taliban haven't hesitated to go after schoolchildren. Their most notable target is Malala Yousafzai, who was singled out and shot in October 2012 as she rode to school in a van with other girls. The teenage girl survived and became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize last week for her efforts to promote education and girls' rights. Yousafzai said the attack left her heartbroken. ""Innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this,"" she said. Afghan Taliban slam Pakistan counterparts . This is the deadliest incident inside Pakistan since October 2007, when 139 Pakistanis died and more than 250 others were wounded in an attack near a procession for exiled former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, according to the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database. Even the Taliban in Afghanistan, who are closely affiliated with their Pakistani counterparts, criticized the killing of women and children as against Islamic teaching. The spokesman for the  Afghan terror group expressed condolences to the victims of Tuesday's attack.","Pakistan lifts moratorium on the death penalty after massacre .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Zuo Zhijian says the heavy crush of bodies around him on the Shanghai waterfront left him unable to move his legs. ""I also had someone grabbing my hair from the back, struggling and breathing heavily,"" Zuo said. ""A girl in front of me held me desperately and said, 'Help me, help me, please. I can't make it anymore.' There was also a girl completely motionless underneath."" Zuo was one among many people caught up in the stampede on the Bund, an area along the Huangpu River in China's most populous city that draws big crowds for New Year's Eve festivities. He described his traumatic experience on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform on which he's a verified user. The stampede, which began roughly 25 minutes before midnight, killed 36 people and injured 47 others, the Shanghai city government said. Many of the victims were female students, state media reported. 'Girls crying and shouting for help' ""I was surrounded by the sounds of girls crying and shouting for help with their last strain of effort, and of people fighting and throwing curses at each other,"" said Zuo, who works in the media sector. Another witness, 28-year-old Tian Ye, who works in import-export logistics, told CNN how he'd gone down to the waterfront to enjoy the festivities because he lives nearby. Instead, he found himself only about 30 meters (about 100 feet) from the scene of the deadly crush. ""When me and other young men saw people had fainted, we rushed there to do CPR and carried them to the ambulance and police cars,"" he said. The stampede lasted only about 30 seconds, he said, but it took about 10 minutes to carry everyone out. ""There were way too many people stuck down there without a clear entrance or exit; people got stuck and panicked. A lot of police gathered in that central area, but more police could have eased the consequences,"" he said. ""When someone fell down, people behind would think the crowd is moving, so more people were moving forward and falling."" He blamed what happened on overcrowding, people's lack of awareness of how to protect themselves, and on heavy traffic that blocked ambulances from getting to the scene sooner. ""But I'm happy to see everyone around me fighting to help others after the tragedy,"" he added. ""No conspiracy, no predesign, it's a tragedy triggered by multiple factors. We tried our best, wish them rest in peace."" Unconscious victims . A third witness, Xiao Ji, said he was at the side of the mass of people as a night of celebration turned into scenes of horror. ""I stared for a while and then started pulling people out of the crowds,"" Xiao, who works at a technology company, said on Weibo. Exhausted after hauling two people out of the crush, he said all he could do was ""hold their hands and try to cheer them up a little bit."" In the chaos described by Xiao, some people were trying to revive unconscious victims and others were simply wailing. Police officers were also trying to help. After he regained strength, Xiao says, he joined in again. A photo from China's state-run news agency Xinhua showed people receiving treatment as they lay in the middle of a crowded street. Cause under investigation . The terrifying crush left a grisly aftermath. ""People lying on the ground were a complete mess,"" said Zuo. ""Their faces became unrecognizable."" It remains unclear what caused the stampede. Authorities are investigating what happened. Xinhua cited one unidentified witness as saying that people started scrambling after coupons that looked like dollar bills were thrown from the third floor of a building. But the Shanghai police said their investigation had ruled out this possibility. Police said that based on surveillance camera footage, the items were tossed about 10 minutes after the stampede and did not cause much commotion. They were coupons from a bar on the Bund. Zuo, Xiao, Tian and other witnesses also made no mention of the coupons in their accounts. And the English-language newspaper Shanghai Daily cited witnesses as saying that the stampede started ""when a large number of people trying to move up to the riverfront esplanade were blocked."" CNN reached out to Zuo and Xiao for further comment, but Zuo didn't immediately respond and Xiao declined to talk to the media. Event moved after problems . Local officials had this year moved a popular New Year's Eve light show from an open area of the Bund to a more enclosed area, citing safety concerns, Shanghai Daily reported. ""Last year, officials were caught off-guard when nearly 300,000 people turned up for the New Year countdown at the Bund, which led to traffic chaos,"" the newspaper said. Officials canceled another New Year's celebration late Wednesday in front of Beijing's tallest skyscraper, citing safety concerns. Even with the light show and official countdown called off, many revelers remained at the location and had their own countdown there. Flowers laid at the scene . The Shanghai stampede prompted scenes of anger and grief. Video from the Reuters news agency showed people sobbing in a hospital waiting room. One woman told state broadcaster CCTV that relatives had been waiting for hours for information about their loved ones. A photo from Agence France-Presse showed people facing off with security guards at a hospital. Dozens of people gathered at the scene of the stampede Thursday, laying bouquets of flowers on the ground. Police cars lined an intersection near where the deadly chaos took place. Chinese President Xi Jinping requested ""an immediate investigation"" into what happened and said ""a profound lesson should be learned"" from the events, Xinhua reported Thursday. Zuo spelled out what he learned from the terrible end to 2014: Don't attend big gatherings like that ever again.

"Istanbul (CNN)A woman carried out a suicide bombing at a police station in Istanbul's historic Sultanahmet district Tuesday evening, killing one police officer and injuring another, officials said. The attack happened in the section of Turkey's largest city that is home to landmarks such as the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, and is heavily trafficked by tourists. The bomber, speaking English, entered the police station saying she lost her wallet, and the explosion happened at about 5:20 p.m., Istanbul Gov. Vasip Sahin told reporters. Sahin did not mention a motive for the attack. Sahin initially said that the blast, besides killing the bomber, critically injured one police officer and slightly wounded another. Later Tuesday, Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency reported that one of the officers died of his wounds at a hospital. Police cordoned off the area. The attacker's identity is unknown and the incident is being investigated, the governor told reporters. CNN's Gul Tuysuz reported and wrote from Istanbul, and CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta.

"(CNN)A group of police officers flying home to Utah from the funeral of slain New York Police Det. Wenjian Liu were unexpectedly called into service in midair. A JetBlue flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Salt Lake City was diverted to Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Sunday after a passenger apparently became suicidal and combative after a fight with her husband, CNN affiliate KSL reported. Before the incident, Flight 71's flight attendants had noted the unusually high number of police officers on the flight. JetBlue offers to fly police to NYPD funeral . Flight attendants separated the fighting couple and brought the wife to the front of the cabin to sit next to Salt Lake Unified Police Department Det. Robert Odor. The detective had an open seat next to him and agreed to sit with her. When Odor noticed her taking pills and writing a note, he grabbed the pill bottle out of her hand, he told KSL. ""She was yelling, she was kicking at us,"" Odor said. As officers held her down, Salt Lake Unified Police Sgt. Terry Wall tried to calm the woman. A crisis-intervention specialist who is often asked to negotiate with distraught people, Wall said he ""tried to let her know that we're there to help her, let her know that she matters, even though she's saying that 'I don't want you to help me, I want to die.'"" The police officers said they held the woman down for more than an hour as the flight diverted to Chicago. They said that handcuffing her could have made the situation worse. By the end of the flight, the woman reportedly told the police she wanted to take her life in a different direction. JetBlue would only say that the flight diverted to Chicago ""after a medical/security issue was reported in the cabin,"" according to a statement. ""The aircraft landed safely, without incident, and was met by first responders. A customer was taken to a local hospital for further evaluation."" ""I can only speculate what would have happened if we hadn't noticed that and the flight had continued for four more hours,"" Odor told KSL. The flight usually takes about five hours but passengers didn't complain that the plane landed about four hours late in Salt Lake City.","Police were flying home to Utah from a New York officer's funeral .

"(CNN)It's a question that's been burning ever since the moment gunmen stormed the Paris office of Charlie Hebdo: Are there other attackers out there? It's very likely, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said. ""We are doing everything we can to dismantle what appears to be a network. ... No doubt there was complicity and networks and maybe finance also,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Investigators are still trying to piece together who was behind the Islamist terror attacks that killed 17 people. Clues have emerged tying the attackers to a man who was once al Qaeda's top recruiter in Europe, and to training with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen. Said and Cherif Kouachi, blamed for Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine, are dead. So is Amedy Coulibaly, who authorities say killed a police officer, carried out an attack at a kosher market and might have shot a jogger. It's not clear how many people might have helped them plot last week's attacks. But Valls said they couldn't have done it without help. ""I don't really believe in the idea of the lone wolf,"" he said. A key player who could help unravel details is Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly's partner and alleged accomplice. Early reports said she was by his side during the hostage siege at the kosher market. But now, investigators believe she was far from Paris when the attacks unfolded. Boumeddiene arrived in Turkey from Madrid on January 2 -- five days before the first attack in Paris, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reports. Boumeddiene stayed at an Istanbul hotel and then traveled to Syria on Thursday, Andalou said.  The last place authorities spotted Boumeddiene was somewhere near Turkey's border with Syria. Police have searched an apartment outside Paris as they try to track her down. There investigators discovered ISIS flags, automatic weapons and detonators at an apartment rented out by Coulibaly, Boumeddiene's partner and suspected co-conspirator, France's RTL Radio reported, citing authorities. Authorities are looking into whether Boumeddiene helped prepare the attacks before leaving France, Valls told CNN. And there's another concern, a U.S. intelligence official told CNN: Now that she is believed to have escaped to Syria, Boumeddiene could be used in propaganda videos to gloat about the attacks. France was on its highest alert level Monday as people went back to work and children returned to schools following the attacks. At least 10,000 soldiers and 8,000 police officers will be deployed across the country, French media reported. ""We must remain vigilant because the threat is still very much present,"" Valls told CNN affiliate BFMTV. About 4,700 officers will be tasked with securing 717 Jewish schools, Valls said. Four of the victims were killed Friday at the kosher market, the latest in a string of anti-Semitic attacks that have led many Jewish families to leave the country. A Muslim employee is credited with helping hide some hostages in a walk-in freezer, which he turned off.  A photo from the freezer shows a baby was among the hostages. ""The situation can only get worse. It does not look like the problem is going away,"" high school student Gary Uzan, 17, told CNN on Monday. ""I will go to Israel. It is better for us. It is safer."" The wife of Cherif Kouachi has condemned her husband's actions. ""She condemns every violent act,"" her attorney, Christian Saint-Palais, said in a statement. ""She was astonished when she learned her husband was involved in the Charlie Hebdo attack."" The statement -- which did not include the wife's name -- expressed her sympathies for the families of the victims. Some 3.7 million people marched in anti-terrorism rallies Sunday across France, including 1.5 million in Paris. About 40 world leaders joined in the march in the French capital. Police said no incidents had been reported despite the record number of people involved in the Paris rally. Still, French law enforcement officers have been told to erase their social media presence and carry weapons at all times because terror sleeper cells have been activated in the country, a police source said. Investigators are looking into whether the attackers last week were part of a larger cell and, if so, when it may strike again, Valls told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The threats go well beyond France. The New York City Police Department and other U.S. law enforcement agencies responded to a threat from ISIS after someone released again a September message that tells followers to  ""rise up and kill intelligence officers, police officers, soldiers, and civilians"" -- specifically naming the United States, France, Australia and Canada as targets. According to a New York police memo obtained by CNN, department employees were told to ""remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol,"" especially in light of the attacks in France last week. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement across the United States. In a statement Monday, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said the Transportation Security Administration is increasing the number of random searches of passengers and carry-on luggage at U.S. airports. Johnson said his agency had implemented new measures, including stepped-up efforts to share ""information about terrorist threats and individuals of suspicion"" with France and ""other key counterterrorism allies"" and to boost security outside U.S. government buildings. Early Sunday, a firebomb was hurled at a German newspaper that reprinted Charlie Hebdo cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed, though authorities haven't said whether the arson attack was connected to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. No one was injured in the attack. CNN's Jim Sciutto, Frederik Pleitgen, Pamela Brown, Sandra Betsis Ljuljanovic, Barbara Starr, Radina Gigova, Hakim Almasmari, Nic Robertson, Al Goodman, Tim Lister, Faith Karimi, Ashley Fantz, Margot Haddad, Lorenzo Ferrigno, Laurie Segall, Evan Perez and Rene Marsh and translator Eric King contributed to this report.","French prime minister: ""I don't really believe in the idea of the lone wolf""

"(CNN)Days after gunmen reigned terror in France, more answers are emerging in the case -- while many remain uncertain. Millions rallied in Paris against terrorism and extremism over the weekend. Thousands of police officers and at least 10,000 soldiers are being deployed across France. And the remaining suspect in last week's terror attacks remains on the loose. And the shooting of a random jogger Wednesday has reportedly been linked to the spate of violence that included the attack at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the deadly siege at a kosher store and the killing of a policewoman. Here's the latest on the investigation, the response and the lingering threat: . Astonishing sight: More than 3.7 million people marched throughout France in colossal anti-terrorism rallies Sunday. French officials say the outpouring was the largest gathering in the country's history. Notable absence: Forty world leaders marched in solidarity at the Paris event, but neither President Barack Obama nor any other high-ranking U.S. official was there. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in India, attending an entrepreneurship summit. Kerry said Monday he'll be headed to France on Thursday and called the criticism against the administration ""sort of quibbling."" ""The U.S. has been deeply engaged with the people of France since this incident occurred,"" Kerry said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday, ""I think it's fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there."" Surprising gesture: Among those condemning the attack included the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which the United States and others consider a terrorist organization. ""The difference of opinions and thoughts cannot justify murder,"" the group said over the weekend. But Hamas didn't specifically condemn the attack on the Jewish supermarket that left four people dead. Fighting back: Just as they promised to do, hackers claiming to be with the group Anonymous say they have blocked a jihadist website in retaliation for the attack. The website ansar-alhaqq.net, a French jihadist site, was redirected to the search engine Duck Duck Go. Hackers using the Twitter handle @OpCharlieHebdo claimed responsibility. Going home: The bodies of the four Jewish victims in the deadly standoff at the kosher market in eastern Paris will be taken to Israel for burial. The funerals will take place Tuesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also said any Jews who want to immigrate to Israel will be welcome. Ever vigilant: At least 10,000 soldiers and 8,000 police officers will be deployed across France as it elevates its national security alert system to the highest level. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said an estimated 4,700 officers will be tasked with securing 717 Jewish schools. ""We must remain vigilant because the threat is still very much present,"" Valls told CNN affiliate BFMTV. Sleeper cells: French police were told Saturday that sleeper cells had been activated over the past 24 hours inside France, terror expert Samuel Laurent said he was told by a police source. He said officers were told to erase all visible online presence on social media and keep their weapons on themselves at all times. Newspaper firebombed: Hamburger Morgenpost, a German newspaper that reprinted the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, was firebombed early Sunday. The incendiary device was thrown into the archive section of the building. No one was inside at the time. Another newspaper -- Le Soir in Belgium -- was evacuated after someone called in a bomb threat. Ripple effect: The head of the British MI5 intelligence service issued a warning that al Qaeda is plotting to massacre a huge number of civilians in Britain and other Western countries. And the New York Police Department told officers to remain alert after someone re-released a September ISIS message that tells followers to ""rise up and kill intelligence officers, police officers, soldiers, and civilians.""  The threat specifically named the United States, France, Australia and Canada as targets. In all, 17 people were massacred by at least three terror suspects over three days. • The first terror attack Wednesday killed 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris. • The next day, a French policewoman was gunned down. • On the third and final day, four hostages were killed when a terrorist seized a Jewish grocery. A fourth attack? Did Amedy Coulibaly, who took customers and workers hostage at a kosher market in eastern Paris on Friday, also shoot a jogger earlier in the week? Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said the attacks on the jogger Wednesday and the supermarket were linked after a ballistic analysis of the bullet casings, French media reported. But investigators can't confirm with certainty that it was Coulibaly who shot the jogger. The jogger is reportedly still in a hospital with life-threatening injuries. In all, four people are suspected in the Paris attacks: . • Brothers Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, who rampaged through the offices of Charlie Hebdo. Security forces killed them Friday, ending a widespread manhunt. • Amedy Coulibaly, 32, who took hostages at the kosher supermarket and is suspected of killing the policewoman. Authorities also killed him. • Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, is Coulibaly's partner and suspected co-conspirator. She remains at large. Linked together: Three of the four suspects were thought to be part of the same jihadist group, said Pascal Disant of the Alliance Police Union. Also, at least one suspect in the supermarket standoff demanded the freedom of the suspects in the Charlie Hebdo attack. Boumeddiene was not in France at the time of the attacks, according to Turkey's Anadolu news agency.  She arrived in Turkey from Madrid on January 2, then traveled to Syria. The last place authorities spotted Boumeddiene was somewhere near Turkey's border with Syria. Valls told CNN that authorities are looking into whether Boumeddiene helped prepare the attacks before leaving France. Is AQAP involved? Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the attack at Charlie Hebdo, the founder of the magazine The Intercept told CNN. But CNN has not independently confirmed this assertion. Possible al-Awlaki tie: But U.S. authorities believe Charlie Hebdo attacker Said Kouachi may have met with the late American terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki at some point in Yemen and received orders from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to carry out an attack, a U.S. official told CNN's Barbara's Starr. ISIS paraphernalia found:  Investigators discovered ISIS flags, automatic weapons and detonators in an apartment near Paris rented by Coulibaly, France's RTL Radio reported Sunday, citing authorities. While Boumeddiene remains at large, her partner's hideaway may provide more clues about her. CNN's Tim Lister, Jethro Mullen, Catherine E. Shoichet, Faith Karimi, Alex Felton and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","A historic, massive rally took place Sunday in France .

"(CNN)God will not likely be representing John Jonchuck Jr., a judge told the 25-year-old father when he appeared in court Thursday on a charge that he killed his 5-year-old daughter by throwing her off of a St. Petersburg, Florida, bridge. During the video hearing, Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Michael Andrews asked the handcuffed Jonchuk if he was able to hire his own lawyer. ""No,"" Jonchuk replied. Would he like one appointed? Again, the reply was, ""No."" ""Are you sure?"" Andrews pressed. ""I want to leave it in the hands of God,"" Jonchuk said. Asked if that meant he wanted to represent himself, Jonchuk repeated his answer, to which the judge said, ""Pretty sure God's not going to be representing you in this case. You're going to be standing trial. Would you like someone standing next to you as you're standing trial?"" ""Yes, that is pure and good, not evil,"" the defendant said. ""I'm going to do the best I can to give you a pure and good lawyer,"" Andrews said. ""I don't want a court-appointed lawyer,"" Jonchuk said, seeming slightly perturbed. ""I want to leave it in the hands of God."" Andrews instructed an officer to bring Jonchuk back to his courtroom Monday ""to see if he wants an attorney."" Though he ordered Jonchuk held on bonds of $10,000 each for charges of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and aggravated fleeing and eluding, Andrews ruled there would be no bond on the first-degree murder charge. Jonchuk was arrested Thursday after a St. Petersburg police officer was driving home just after midnight and saw a car whiz past him, driving about 100 mph, authorities said. According to the arrest affidavit, Jonchuk parked on the Dick Misener Bridge, exited, ignored the officer's command to stay in the vehicle and reached into the right rear passenger seat where his daughter, Phoebe, was sitting. Jonchuk ""then carried the child in his arms to the side of the bridge and intentionally dropped the child into the water ... then entered his vehicle and fled the scene,"" the affidavit said. The officer heard a splash and tried to climb beneath the bridge to save the girl, but the current was too strong, St. Petersburg police spokeswoman Yolanda Fernandez told CNN affiliate WFLA. It's about a 62-foot drop to the water from that point on the bridge. Another officer tried to pull over Jonchuk's white Chrysler PT Cruiser on Interstate 275, but the defendant allegedly ""conducted a U-turn and drove directly at a backup officer's vehicle, in which case the officer had to take evasive action to avoid a crash,"" another arrest affidavit said. Several law enforcement agencies joined the chase, including marked patrol cars with their emergency lights and sirens activated, for several miles. Jonchuk eventually stopped his vehicle in the middle of the interstate and was taken into custody, according to the affidavit. The body of the girl was later recovered. Jonchuck is being held at the Pinellas County Jail. Police have not disclosed a motive. Boy found dead after mother says she threw him off a bridge .

"(CNN)The knock was faint. But, alerted by his two dachshunds, Larry Wilkins went to his door and opened it to see a young girl -- her lips quivering, her nose bloodied, her arms and legs scratched up. And, somehow, still alive. ""She told me that her mom and dad were dead,"" Wilkins said of the girl, Sailor Gutzler. ""And that she had been in a plane crash."" The girl's sister and cousin also died when their Piper PA-34 aircraft went down Friday evening in western Kentucky. Even with the plane upside down, the 7-year-old made it out and trekked three-quarters of a mile in the dark through what Wilkins described as ""very, very rough territory,"" mired with fallen trees, creeks, ditches and blackberry briars. Sailor was barefoot except for one sock and was dressed for Florida -- shorts, no coat -- not for slogging through the January cold of Kentucky. Wilkins got her on his couch and called 911, alerting authorities that a plane had gone down and there was at least one survivor. Kentucky State Police troopers arrived in about 10 minutes. Sgt. Dean Patterson said the girl was taken to a local hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. ""She's a terribly brave little girl, I'll tell you that,"" Wilkins said. ""I can't imagine a 7-year-old doing that."" FAA: Pilot reported engine problems . The plane Sailor was on had left the warm, sunny climes of Key West, Florida, earlier Friday, heading for Mount Vernon, Illinois, a city roughly 80 miles east of St. Louis. Until something went wrong. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen explained that air traffic controllers ""lost contact with a Piper PA-34 aircraft ... shortly after the pilot reported engine problems and (said) that he was diverting to the Kentucky Dam State (Park) Airport."" The twin-engine aircraft didn't make it, crashing in Lyon County, about 30 miles east of Paducah, and less than 10 miles from the airport. Two National Transportation Safety Board members left Washington late Saturday morning for Kentucky, agency spokesman Keith Holloway said. They will join FAA investigators there to try to find out what caused the crash. Kentucky State Police identified the dead early Saturday as Marty Gutzler, 48; Kimberly Gutzler, 46; and 9-year-old Piper Gutzler -- a husband, wife and their daughter. Also killed was 14-year-old Sierra Wilder, the survivor's cousin. All were from Nashville, Illinois, a community of just over 3,000 people. Lt. Brent White told CNN affiliate KFVS that first responders ""worked tirelessly to find this wreckage and hopefully salvage the lives of those that were on board."" ""But, ultimately, it just wasn't meant to be."" Their bodies were removed and the plane was covered early Saturday morning, Lyon County Judge Executive Wade White said. Patterson, with the state police, said that members of the NTSB were expected to arrive later in the day. Inclement weather was hampering the investigation, he said in a statement. ""Officials have indicated a minimum of two days to conduct an investigation at the scene,"" he said. Marty Gutzler's Facebook page showed photos of his smiling daughters, political posts and his family sitting in a small plane with him at the controls. The latest one is of him and his wife celebrating New Year's Eve at a Key West resort. The Rev. Matthew Wietfeldt of Nashville's Trinity Lutheran Church said those killed -- whom he's known for four years -- ""will be deeply missed."" ""The Gutzlers were a wonderful family and wonderful members of our congregation and community,"" Wietfeldt said. Kent Plotner, an attorney representing the family, said in a statement, ""The Gutzler family mourns the loss of Marty, Kim and Piper Gutzler and Sierra Wilder. We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms.  We ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time.  Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler."" A fund has been set up ""for the benefit of Sailor Gutzler,"" at sailorgutzlerfund.com, Plotner said. ""The family thanks you for the heartfelt words of sympathy that have been expressed during this unimaginable loss,"" he added. Plane crash sole survivors wrestle with guilt . Police: 'It's just really a miracle' How the youngest person on the plane managed to emerge alive also hit close to home for many like Trooper White, who has an 8-year-old girl of his own. ""When I saw ... what appeared to be a 7-year-old child that had walked through this dense forest and through some really tough terrain and some awfully poor conditions tonight and survived this,"" he said, ""it's just really a miracle."" Wilkins says he believes  Sailor saw his street lights through the woods and, thankfully, found him -- in one of only three homes in his neighborhood that are occupied in winter. White, the Lyon County executive, said the fact she went that way ""saved her life."" ""Any other direction could have ended badly with the cold weather,"" he said. Sailor was released from Lourdes Hospital in Paducah just after 1 a.m. Saturday, state police said. Thinking about what the 7-year-old went through and what comes next brings tears to Wilkins' eyes, he said. ""I just feel so sorry for that little girl, I can't understand it,"" Wilkins said.

"New York (CNN)  -- The unregulated nature of the Web has aided a proliferation of cyber-hate, according to a report the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Tolerance released Monday. The report, Digital Terrorism and Hate 2010, notes that there are about 11,500 hate-affiliated Web pages, a 20 percent jump from last year's study. According to the Wiesenthal Center, personal blogs as well as mainstream social-networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and Twitter are easily flooded with racist and terrorist-related content. ""The spike is not in traditional Web sites in the United States,"" said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. ""It's more global and almost all in the social-networking area."" Mark Weitzman, director of government affairs for the Wiesenthal Center and a co-author of the report, said home-grown terrorism suspects have an active online presence. He cited the case of a Pennsylvania woman who officials say called herself ""Jihad Jane."" The woman, Colleen LaRose, has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and kill a person in a foreign country. She had been on the radar of the Wiesenthal Center for the past year, Weitzman said. ""We ask, 'Are they just coming out of the woodwork?' and the answer in every single case is the Internet link,"" Cooper said. Although these sites are monitored, the report's authors said, they have become increasingly alarmed by the ""lone wolf"" effect, making it difficult for law enforcement to discern which threats are legitimate and which are simply talk. For example, the late James W. Von Brunn, the 88-year-old who was charged in the fatal shooting of a security guard at the National Holocaust Museum in Washington in June, kept a Web site called the Holy Western Empire. On it, he blamed a ""Negro jury, Jew/Negro attorneys"" and ""a Jew judge"" for a six-year prison term he served in the 1980s. However, ""there's no equation that says someone who posts a rant ... is going to go on a shooting rampage,"" said Weitzman, who has testified in front of Congress and the United Nations on the issue of digital hate. Perhaps even more chilling are the growing numbers of ""how to"" Web sites in which terror groups routinely post instructional manuals and videos on bombmaking and computer hacking. The study also explored e-commerce and how it can be used to market hate. In February, an eBay merchant offered ""an original Holocaust ring,"" claiming that it came from his uncle who was posted at the Dachau concentration camp during World War II. EBay pulled the Web page before a sale was made. Founded in 1977, the Simon Wiesenthal Center was named after a Jew who survived the Holocaust and became famous for his career as a Nazi hunter.","Internet's unregulated nature has aided proliferation of cyber-hate, report says .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)The  attackers sped into a Nigerian town with grenade launchers -- their gunfire and explosions shattering the early morning calm. As terrified residents scattered into bushes in Baga town and surrounding villages, the gunmen unloaded motorcycles from their trucks and followed in hot pursuit. Residents hid under scant brush. Bullets pierced them. Some sought refuge in their homes. They were burned alive. Many who tried to cross into neighboring Chad drowned while trying to swim through Lake Chad. By the time the weapons went quiet, local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as 2,000 people. That was January 3, nine days ago. On Monday, bodies still littered the bushes in the area. ""It is still not safe to go and pick them up for burial,"" said Musa Bukar, the chairman of the local government where Baga is located. No emergency crews will enter the villages where militants are still running amok, local authorities said. ""Baga is not accessible because it is still occupied by Boko Haram,"" said Sen. Maina Ma'aji Lawan of northern Borno state. The strategic Nigerian town borders Chad, giving the extremists better access to both countries. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The group's brutal tactics have shocked and stunned the world. It has kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in April -- and remain missing. On Saturday, explosives strapped to a girl detonated at a crowded marketplace in Nigeria, killing at least 20 people. Although no one has claimed responsibility, Boko Haram militants are the main suspects. But the scale of the early January attack -- the death of hundreds, possibly thousands -- defies belief. The attacks started at dawn on January 3 and continued throughout the weekend, according to residents. ""Each new crime committed by Boko Haram exceeds the last in brutality. This is a direct consequence of the environment of total impunity in which Boko Haram operates. Every time they get away with mass murder, rape and the enslavement of women and children, they are emboldened,"" Angelina Jolie, special envoy of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement. She urged the United States and other nations to offer Nigeria help to ""collect evidence and bring the perpetrators of these attacks to justice."" Amnesty International called the massacre  Boko Haram's ""deadliest act."" ""If reports that the town was largely razed to the ground and that hundreds or even as many as 2,000  civilians were killed are true, this marks a disturbing and bloody escalation of Boko Haram's ongoing onslaught,""  said Daniel Eyre, Nigeria researcher for Amnesty International. The Nigerian military said the description of the attack as ""the deadliest"" was ""quite valid."" ""The attack on the town by the bloodhounds and their activities since January 3 should convince well meaning people all over the world that Boko Haram is the evil all must collaborate to end,"" it said. The misery is far from over. Those who survived the attack and tried to swim to Chad are now stranded on Kangala Island on Lake Chad. Chadian authorities are asking the United Nations to help relocate more than 1,000 of them. Abubakar Gamandi, a native of Baga who was away during the attack, said those trapped there are dying. ""‎I have been in touch with them on the phone,"" he said. ""They told me ‎some of them are dying from lack of food, cold and malaria on the mosquito-infested island."" Of the 30,000 people displaced during the attacks, 20,000 camped in Maiduguri city. An additional 10,000 were being ferried from Monguno town, which is about 60 kilometers (36 miles) from Baga. Mike Omeri, a national security spokesman, said Nigerian troops are pursuing the militants.‎ . ""Security forces have responded rapidly and have deployed significant military assets and conducted airstrikes against militant targets,"" Omeri said. ""Troops are engaged in operations to reclaim the area from the terrorists."" But Gamandi, the Baga native, said it's not true. ""From information we are receiving from residents nearby, not a single Nigerian soldier has shown up in Baga since it was seized by Boko Haram,"" he said. ""It is all propaganda."" Critics have accused President Goodluck Jonathan's government of not doing enough to address the insurgency, which mostly affects opposition strongholds. Nigeria is holding presidential elections next month. Last week, Jonathan launched his re-election bid in a raucous rally in Lagos. He did not say a word about the massacres. CNN's Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta, and Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano.

"(CNN) -- An unapologetic Donald Trump insisted Sunday that he is ""the least racist"" when pressed as to whether racism motivated his recent focus on President Obama's birth certificate and academic qualifications. The millionaire-turned-television host spoke with CNN's Don Lemon about the White House Correspondents Dinner and whether a presidential bid was in the offing, before the conversation turned to matters of race and comments made earlier in the day by CBS' ""Face the Nation"" host Bob Schieffer. Schieffer's comments were in response to Trump's public questions about Obama's academic degree. ""The word is, he wasn't a good student and he ended up getting into Columbia and Harvard,"" Trump said recently. ""I'd like to know: How does he get into Harvard, how does he get into Columbia if he isn't a good student?"" Referencing those comments, Schieffer said on his Sunday program, ""that's just code for saying 'he got into law school because he's black.' This is an ugly strain of racism that's running through this whole thing."" Schieffer's statement referenced an internet meme that has grown rapidly in recent weeks, fueled by comments from public personalities, like ""The View's"" Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg, other media personalities and academics. ""Racism by inference"" is how African-American professor Michael Eric Dyson, also on ""Face the Nation,"" described it. ""Skepticism about black intelligence and suspicion about black humanity have gone hand in hand throughout the history of this country in feeding the perception that black people don't quite measure up,"" he said. ""He is standing in for the rest of us as African-Americans,"" Dyson added. ""We are constantly questioned as to our legitimacy - whether we belong or not."" But when Lemon questioned Trump Sunday night about race stereotypes, he insisted, ""I am a wonderful person as far as you would be concerned as to race. And I think everybody that knows me knows that."" Trump said repeatedly that people who know him ""would laugh"" at the suggestion that he is racist. Lemon also asked Trump about his recent use of the term ""the blacks"" to refer to black people. But Trump said the issue was a diversion. ""I have many, many black friends who said to me, 'absolutely not a problem.' ... The fact is, I wanna focus on jobs, the economy ... that nations are laughing at us and taking our money and taking our jobs and ripping us off."" But anti-racism activist Tim Wise said Trump's tactic is the latest move in an old game. ""This is part of a long-standing, white conservative narrative that people of color are getting things they don't deserve because of affirmative action or racial handouts,"" Wise told Lemon after Trump's interview. ""So either Donald Trump is either the most uninformed individual in the western world because he doesn't know how his comments fit that narrative; or he knows full well what he's doing and he is deliberately pushing these buttons of racial resentment."" David Buck, of Buck Davis and Company, was more sympathetic to Trump. ""When a white man with privilege questions a black man's intelligence it sounds very racist and sounds very stereotypical,"" Buck said. ""He probably is a wonderful man. He's a very smart man. But it's a prime example of how a wonderful, smart man could make a mistake.""","Trump insisted he is ""the least racist"" when questioned by CNN's Don Lemon .

"(CNN)  -- Father Alberto Cutie, an internationally known Catholic priest who admitted having a romantic affair and breaking his vow of celibacy, is joining the Episcopal Church to be with the woman he loves, he said Thursday. Father Alberto Cutie will deliver a sermon Sunday at a Florida Episcopal Church. ""I will always love the Catholic Church and all its members,"" he said at a news conference. ""But I want to start today by going into a new family. ""Here before this community where I have chosen to serve and where I live, I am going to continue to proclaim the word of God and my love for God,"" Cutie said. Cutie (pronounced koo-tee-AY) was received into the Episcopal Church earlier Thursday at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Miami, Florida. He will pursue the priesthood in the Episcopalian faith, the Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida said in a written statement. It was not immediately clear how long the process would take. John C. Favalora, archbishop of the Catholic Church's Miami archdiocese, where Cutie served, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the news. ""Father Cutie's actions have caused grave scandal within the Catholic Church, harmed the Archdiocese of Miami -- especially our priests -- and led to division within the ecumenical community and the community at large,"" Favalora said in a written statement. ""Today's announcement only deepens those wounds."" Cutie -- sometimes called ""Father Oprah"" because of the advice he's given in Spanish-language media -- shocked the Catholic community when photographs of him embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman emerged this month in the pages of TV Notas magazine. The Cuban-American priest admitted having a two-year relationship with the woman, a long-time friend. She has not been publicly identified. ""This is something I've struggled with,"" he said this month. ""I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise."" Of his relationship with the woman, he said, ""Through the photos, it looked like a frivolous thing on the beach, you know, and that's not what it is. It's something deeper than that."" After the photographs surfaced, Cutie was removed from his duties at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace Networks. In Thursday's statement, Favalora said that, in the eyes of the Catholic church, Cutie now has the worst of both worlds: He may no longer perform a priest's sacraments and any mass he might perform would be ""invalid,"" but he must abide by his vow of celibacy. ""Father Cutie is still bound by his promise to live a celibate life, which he freely embraced at ordination,"" Favalora said. ""Only the Holy Father can release him from that obligation."" He had been president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications, home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace. In addition to his television and radio appearances, Cutie has written newspaper advice columns and a self-help book, ""Real Life, Real Love."" The Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida said Cutie will deliver a sermon Sunday at a church that diocese leaders are looking to restore: the Church of the Resurrection in Biscayne Park. Cutie will be a part of this effort to revitalize this church and others, the diocese said. Cutie was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network, according to his information on the LinkedIn online professional network. Favalora also had harsh words for the Episcopal church's decision to accept Cutie. ""This truly is a serious setback for ecumenical relations and cooperation between us,"" he said.","NEW:  Archbishop at Miami archdiocese ""deeply disappointed""

"(CNN)A member of rapper Nicki Minaj's touring crew died and another was critically injured early Wednesday during a stabbing in Philadelphia. ""Two members of my team were stabbed last night in Philly. One was killed,"" Minaj tweeted. ""They had only been there for two days rehearsing for the tour."" Philadelphia police identified the victims as De'Von Pickett, 29, who went by Day Day, and Eric Parker, 27. They went to a bar with friends late Tuesday in Philadelphia's East Mount Airy neighborhood. ""They got into some type of verbal altercation with several other males which quickly escalated into a physical confrontation,"" Philadelphia police Capt. James Clark told CNN affiliate WPVI. ""One of those males pulled out a knife and stabbed both of them multiple times."" They were taken to a local hospital, where Pickett was pronounced dead and Parker is in critical condition. The stabber drove away from the bar. Police are checking surveillance video in the area, WPVI reported. Singer/songwriter Candace Wakefield tweeted a picture of the victims.

"An extraordinary sea of dark blue flooded the streets around a Queens church Saturday morning -- thousands of police paying respects for one of two New York police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty last weekend. More than 25,000 police officers from throughout the country and even Canada came to Christ Tabernacle in the Glendale neighborhood for the funeral of Rafael Ramos, 40. The ceremony began when a police honor guard carried Ramos' casket into the church. Then Vice President Joe Biden, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton delivered eulogies that were notably solemn and expressive, political and apolitical. Ramos and his partner, Officer Wenjian Liu, were gunned down December 20 as they sat in their patrol car in Brooklyn. The gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, shot himself at a subway shortly afterward. He earlier posted angry messages on social media against police and government, citing two black men killed by officers. Liu's funeral will be January 4. During Saturday's service, Bratton announced he was appointing Ramos as an honorary NYPD chaplain and posthumously promoting Ramos and Liu to the rank of detective. The service ended with trumpeters playing taps and ""America the Beautiful"" as the pallbearers carried the casket to a hearse attended by the Ramos' widow and two sons. Several police helicopters flew in formation above a vast crowd of officers wearing white gloves, and then hundreds of police motorcyclists rumbled as lead escorts of the cortege. Officers formed endless chains holding hands in prayer during the funeral. ""I have 31 years on the job, I've never seen such a show of support as we have today,"" said Patrick Lynch, head of the city's police union. Biden: ""It's an uncommon fraternity"" As impressive as the display of blue was under the clear skies, the tributes inside the church moved mourners to tears, applause -- even moments of levity. At times, the eulogies and officers' reactions captured how a nation struggles with the honor and conduct of police in the wake of citizen killings. At one point, scores of officers turned their back on a large TV screen showing the live address by the mayor inside the church. Tensions between the NYPD and the mayor came to a boil during recent protests after a grand jury declined to indict an officer in the death this summer of Eric Garner in Staten Island. Lynch has said the mayor and City Hall had ""blood"" on their hands for supporting critics and protesters against police. After Saturday's funeral, Lynch declined to comment directly about the officers' about-face. ""The feeling is real, but today is about mourning; tomorrow is about debate,"" he said. When asked what he would tell those protesting officers, Lynch stated: ""We have to understand the betrayal that they feel, but today we also come to bow our head in mourning, and tomorrow we'll debate."" Saturday, Wiley Norvell released the following statement on behalf of the Mayor's Office: . ""The Ramos and Liu families, our police department and our city are dealing with an unconscionable tragedy. Our sole focus is unifying this city and honoring the lives of our two police officers."" On Sunday, Bratton said he believed the scores of police officers who turned their back on de Blasio during speech at the funeral acted inappropriately. ""I certainly don't support that action yesterday. I think it was very inappropriate at that event. That funeral was held to honor Officer Ramos. And to bring politics, to bring issues into that event I think was very inappropriate and I do not support it,"" Bratton told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Bratton said the ""rift"" would likely go on for a ""while longer."" ""The issues go on far beyond race relations in this city. They involve the labor contracts, they involve a lot of history ... different from some of what's going on in the country as a whole,"" Bratton said. Biden, the first eulogizer, focused on the Ramos family's loss. ""I'm sure I speak for the whole nation when I say our hearts ache for you,"" the vice president told the family during the service. He said the thousands of officers surrounding the church ""will stand with you for the rest of your life."" ""It's an uncommon fraternity,"" Biden said of the police. He added, ""Thank God for them."" ""Amen,"" some in the church said. ""This is the finest police department in the world,"" Biden added, drawing applause. He added that the bullets that targeted the officers also ""targeted the city, and (they) touched the soul of an entire nation."" Cuomo mentions threats, ""abusive tirades"" The governor led the congregation in delivering a round of applause to the Ramos family. Then, he made note of protesters who have taken strong exception to police conduct and the recent deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police. Cuomo praised the professionalism of the NYPD officers during tense demonstrations in the city. ""The NYPD protected the right of free speech even though they were targets of false and abusive tirades,"" the governor said. ""What a beautiful testament to their professionalism."" He also noted threats against police. ""The threats against the New York police are insults to the law-abiding and won't be tolerated,"" Cuomo said, adding that the National Guard ""has your back every step of your way."" Anyone making threats ""will be investigated, and they will be prosecuted,"" Cuomo added. Cuomo also delivered a measure of relief when he spoke of Ramos' two sons. ""Justin and Jaden are Mets fans, which tells us a lot of about them. It means they are really tough and really committed and really, really, really loyal,"" Cuomo said, drawing widespread laughter. Mayor avoids politics . A couple of officers booed de Blasio when he arrived for the funeral. Some protest signs against him, including ""Dump de Blasio,"" could be seen, but they were small displays and officers were largely polite. Some officers turned their backs on the church as the mayor spoke. Ill feelings toward de Blasio stem from critics' contention that -- amid protests that arose after a grand jury's refusal to indict a police officer in the July death of Eric Garner in Staten Island -- the mayor was not supportive of the police. Some have accused him of fomenting an anti-police fervor that contributed to the deaths of Liu and Ramos. Nonetheless, in his remarks de Blasio did not comment on protests or threats against police. Instead, he hailed Ramos for his desire to serve people in many ways. Ramos spent the last 10 weeks of his life studying to be a chaplain, and he was to graduate on the day he was killed. ""He was already serving in so many ways, and yet he felt deeply called to serve spiritually, as well,"" de Blasio said. ""Our hearts are aching today,"" the mayor said. ""I feel it physically. ... New York City has lost a hero -- a remarkable man because of the depth of his commitment to all around him."" He offered condolences to Ramos' family, and then to the NYPD, who he said is ""hurting so deeply right now."" Ramos made honorary chaplain . The police commissioner drew applause when he stated that Ramos ""was a hero."" The pair were killed, Bratton observed, simply because of the uniform they wore. ""They were killed because they were blue."" ""Officer Ramos was assassinated because he represented all of us,"" Bratton said. Bratton drew applause again when he announced he was appointing Ramos, posthumously and effective Saturday, as honorary department chaplain for the 84th Precinct. Bratton also promoted both Ramos and Liu to detectives first grade, posthumously, drawing applause again. Livestreaming . Television monitors and loudspeakers broadcast the service to the crowds packing the streets outside. The church posted a stream of photographs of Ramos' on YouTube. The service began with a young woman the church identified as Mia Hunt-Pierce singing the national anthem. Police outside stood at attention. The church choir then sang the Christmas carol ""O Come All Ye Faithful."" NYPD Officer Rafael Ramos saw streets as his ministry . Ramos leaves a wife, Maritza, and sons Justin and Jaden, the latter of whom recounted how he had to say goodbye to his father in an emotional Facebook post. ""(H)e was the best father I could ask for,"" Jaden wrote after the shooting. ""It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer. Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad."" Justin, the older brother, spoke at his father's wake at the church Friday, according to CNN affiliate NY 1. ""My father was a man of character. He was a selfless man,"" the college sophomore said. ""He always went above and beyond for his family, constantly putting everyone before himself. Dad, I'm forever grateful for the sacrifices you made to provide for me and Jaden."" Charities offer help to families of slain officers . His pastor, the Rev. Rafael Castillo, said his death was a loss for the church. ""He was a man of great faith, and his faith informed his worldview, not just as a police officer, but as a husband and as a father,"" Castillo said. ""And as I've been saying, we are going to miss him a great deal.""","""Today is about mourning; tomorrow is about debate,"" police union head says .

"(CNN)The New York City Police Department  and other law enforcement personnel responded to a threat from ISIS after someone re-released a September 2014 message that tells followers to ""rise up and kill intelligence officers, police officers, soldiers, and civilians."" The threat named the United States, France, Australia and Canada as targets. In an internal memo, NYPD employees were told to ""remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol,"" especially in light of the attacks in France last week. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement across the country. That bulletin and the NYPD memo make it clear that this new message is consistent with previous threats that ISIS and others, including al Qaeda, have issued. John Miller, the NYPD deputy commissioner for counterterrorism, tempered fears of a threat to officials in New York City. ""I don't think that we are under any more threat ... or any less threat than we were the day before,"" he said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Miller said the department is on a ""heightened security posture on a normal day compared to almost any other police department."" More than 1,000 police officers and civilian analysts are assigned to a counterterrorism mission every day, and officers have studied the recent attacks in France, he said. France was hit with three days of terror after three suspects killed 17 civilians in multiple attacks last week. Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? On Sunday, an update to an old ISIS video was released by an unidentified person or organization, adding scenes from the France terror attack. The video was not issued by ISIS, and the warnings in the video are taken from an earlier video released on September 14. ""They are hoping that the attacks in Paris by a group which included a self-professed ISIS follower will inspire other attacks in the West,"" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. Miller did say, however, that the video re-release shows that ISIS is ""using the momentum from the Paris attacks in part of their messaging strategy to see: 'Who can we get to follow this?' "" ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani's ""fatwa calling for lone-wolf attacks back in September was a game changer,"" Cruickshank said. ""Since then, we've seen ISIS-inspired attacks in all the Western countries he specifically mentioned: Canada, the United States, Australia and France. In October we also saw United Kingdom police break up a plot to target soldiers and police by extremists who British authorities say were deeply influenced by Adnani's fatwa,"" Cruickshank added. NYPD: Hatchet attack an act of terror . The spree began in Paris on Wednesday at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine, after two brothers stormed the building, killing 12 people and later escaping. Early Thursday, a female police officer was killed after a man dressed in all black and wearing bulletproof vests shot her in a Paris suburb. Two hostage situations unfolded Friday between law enforcement and the two sets of suspects. The first scene ended with the two brothers suspected of the magazine murders killed by security forces, said Bernard Corneille, the mayor of Othis, France. At the same time, authorities moved into a kosher store where hostages were being held by the alleged cop killer. While 15 hostages escaped, four were killed, as was the suspect.

"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)Incoherent. Talking nonsense. Erratic. Not the man they knew. That's how family members and friends have described Eddie Ray Routh, the man on trial for the slayings of Chris Kyle, subject of the hit film ""American Sniper,"" and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a Texas firing range two years ago. No one disputes that Routh shot and killed the two men. But defense attorneys say Routh was insane. On Wednesday, the suspect's sister, brother-in-law and former girlfriend testified about Routh's behavior before and after the killings. ""I asked him if he was seeing things, and he said yes,"" Jennifer Weed, his ex, told the court, describing a conversation that happened the night before the slayings. ""And then I asked him if he was hearing things, and he said yes."" Weed testified that Routh got out a yellow legal pad and started writing. ""And when I tried to speak to him he would take his hand and cover my mouth because he didn¹t want them to hear what I had to say,"" she said. Routh's demeanor after the killings was equally strange. ""He said he had to take two souls before they could take his. And I asked him what he meant by that, and he said they were out to get him,"" Laura Blevins, his sister, told the court. ""He was talking nonsense."" She said she told him: ""I love you, but I hate your demons."" ""The man who was my brother was not at my house. The person who came to my house is not the man who I knew was my brother,"" Blevins testified. Her husband said that Routh ""babbled about other incoherent things."" ""I had a sick feeling on what it meant,"" Gaines Blevins told the court. Prosecutors have described Routh as a troubled young man, but they argue he wasn't insane; they say these are the actions of a cold-blooded killer. On Tuesday, prosecutors showed a video of police placing Routh into a squad car moments after authorities chased him down a Texas highway. In the video, Routh is breathing heavily and teary-eyed. An officer asks if he's OK. Routh replies: ""I'm just so nervous about what's been happening in my life today. I don't know what's been happening. I've been so paranoid schizophrenic all day. I don't know what to even think of the world right now. I don't know if I'm insane or sane."" The small arsenal of weapons Kyle brought to the range that day was shown to the jury, which included five long rifles and several handguns, including one of Kyle's rifles labeled ""American Sniper."" According to defense attorneys, Routh, in his psychotic state, thought he was walking into a showdown on the range. Taking the stand for the defense, mother Jodi Routh described her son's history of mental health problems. After his time serving in the military, she said, ""he was no longer his happy-go-lucky self."" His first stay in a VA mental ward was for three days in 2011, she said. Then he returned again, against his will, and spent weeks in the facility. When he was released, she said, he was on nine medications, including mood elevators, anti-psychotic medications and sleep aids. Jodi Routh said she had asked Kyle to help, telling him that her son had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She told Kyle that her son had been hospitalized multiple times, but did not tell him that he'd also threatened to kill himself and his family. ""Do you regret not sharing that level of detail?"" prosecutor Jane Starnes asked. ""I just wanted to get help for my son,"" the mother replied. Routh's trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history, with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. ""American Sniper,"" directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, has grossed the most ever for a war movie. Kyle's autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. He had already risen to fame through his book when he died and was involved in charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh to the firing range as a kind of therapy. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated. A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Catherine E.

"(CNN) -- Bobby DeLaughter -- the prosecutor who secured the conviction in the infamous Medgar Evers Mississippi murder case -- is himself now headed to prison. It was DeLaughter's dogged 1994 prosecution and the subsequent conviction of Ku Klux Klan member Byron De La Beckwith that helped trigger the reopening of dozens of civil rights cold cases. DeLaughter became an instant hero of the civil rights movement. Alec Baldwin portrayed him in the 1996 movie, ""Ghosts of Mississippi,"" and his closing statement was once dubbed one of the greatest closing arguments in modern law. ""Is it ever too late to do the right thing?"" DeLaughter told the jury of eight blacks and four whites. ""For the sake of justice and the hope of us as a civilized society, I sincerely hope and pray that it's not."" DeLaughter would go on to become a state judge in 2002. His years in the robe came to an end in 2009, when DeLaughter pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for lying to an FBI agent in a far-reaching corruption probe that has rocked Mississippi's judicial system. When he was sentenced in November, Byron De La Beckwith's son sat in the chamber wearing a Confederate flag pin on his red blazer. His father had also worn a Confederate pin during the 1994 trial. DeLaughter is to begin serving his 18-month prison sentence today at a facility in Kentucky. ""The man has now been destroyed, politically and economically. It's that serious,"" said Charles Evers, the brother of Medgar Evers. He said he is trying to raise money to help pay DeLaughter's expenses while he's in prison. ""What can we do but fight for a man who fought for us?"" he said. ""I want DeLaughter to know I'm behind him 100 percent."" DeLaughter's attorney, Tom Durkin, refused CNN's request to speak to the prosecutor-turned-judge ahead of his incarceration. ""Bobby DeLaughter remains a civil rights hero, and nothing is going to tarnish that,"" Durkin said. ""The penalty he's paying is enormous, and I think it's sad and unfortunate. But that's simply the way it is."" Over the last month, CNN spoke with more than a dozen lawyers in Mississippi about DeLaughter's fall from grace. They paint a picture of an ambitious man with a brilliant legal mind who ran afoul of the law -- of friends betraying friends and of big-time money corrupting the system. Some take delight in his downfall; others call it a tragedy that has stained the legal community. In the end, the lawyers said, DeLaughter trusted one man too much: His mentor, Ed Peters, who exploited their friendship and then turned on DeLaughter to avoid prison. ""This is a Shakespearean tragedy in the sense that a person falls from grace due to their own character defects -- in this case, misplaced trust in a friend and, perhaps, some combination of ambition and hubris,"" said Matt Steffey, a law professor at Mississippi College School of Law. The story of DeLaughter going from civil rights hero to convicted felon is complicated, involving years of contentious litigation in his courtroom. At the heart of the case is Dickie Scruggs, a high-powered lawyer who made tens of millions of dollars in tobacco and asbestos litigation. Scruggs is the brother-in-law of former Sen. Trent Lott and is now serving seven years in prison for trying to influence Mississippi judges, including DeLaughter. According to prosecutors, Scruggs wanted to get to DeLaughter through his mentor, Peters, to try to influence DeLaughter's ruling in a high stakes case, potentially worth $15 million. Peters received $1 million in illicit payments as compensation for his actions, prosecutors say. Peters was granted immunity in exchange for his cooperation. ""Mississippi would like to shake its image of being tied to civil rights crimes and the good ole boy network, and we see these two things overlap here,"" Steffey said. ""It's enormously unfortunate for a person like Judge DeLaughter who, at the very least, accomplished heroic things with bringing Byron De La Beckwith to justice. And it's tragic for the people of Mississippi -- that the end story here is that he is a corrupt judge in prison."" DeLaughter has denied taking any money in the case or that he was improperly influenced. In his guilty plea, he admits to only obstruction of justice; the more serious charges of involvement in a bribery scheme and mail fraud conspiracy were dismissed as part of the deal. ""To me, he is a tragic figure because he had a good career and he threw it away,"" said attorney Bill Kirksey. ""He became an embarrassment to the legal community, to the judicial community and, I would hope, to himself."" Kirksey has an axe to grind with DeLaughter. He was one of the attorneys representing the client who stood to gain millions in the case at hand. Kirksey and DeLaughter also trained under the same attorney several decades ago; Kirksey believes DeLaughter turned his back on everything they learned. ""Bobby DeLaughter betrayed every single oath he ever took. He betrayed the whole system of justice that we live by,"" Kirksey said. ""You measure a man by the whole of his life, not part of it. When the measure of the man is that he's dishonest in the end, then you have to wonder why he did anything in the beginning."" Merrida Coxwell was one of two lawyers who represented De La Beckwith in the 1994 trial. He has known DeLaughter for three decades, first as a defense attorney, then a prosecutor and finally as a judge. ""Quite frankly, I thought he was a very moderate, straight-down-the-line judge,"" he said. He was shocked when allegations first surfaced. For a judge to be caught up in such a scandal, Coxwell said, is unfathomable. ""If you can't have justice inside the justice system, then it's no good at all."" Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, represented Myrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers -- the NAACP leader who was gunned down in his driveway on June 12, 1963. He says only one man had the guts to seek prosecution in the case when two previous trials years before ended without convictions. ""If Bobby DeLaughter hadn't been around, it would never have happened. I can guarantee you that,"" Dees said. ""It was the first modern-day prosecution of one of these old civil rights-era murders, and it resulted in the prosecution and convictions of a large number later."" DeLaughter's bravery in seeking justice in the Evers case, Dees said, makes it tough to swallow his more recent failings as a judge. ""Certainly, when a judge is put in prison and pleads guilty,"" Dees said, ""it certainly tarnishes his legal and judicial reputation."" Charles Evers said he will continue fighting for the man who fought so valiantly for his brother. ""We will do whatever's necessary to help him get over his dilemma, and I'll say that over and over again."" Evers blasted prosecutors for offering immunity to Ed Peters, DeLaughter's mentor who avoided jail time even though he was the one accepting illicit payments. ""The man who squealed on him should be going to jail,"" Evers said. ""I hope that some day justice will be fair and equal. ... It's not fair and equal in this case.""","Bobby DeLaughter was hailed as hero after convicting the killer of Medgar Evers .

"(CNN)Two people were killed and another wounded Saturday in a shooting at the food court of a central Florida mall,  police said. A woman identified as Ida Garcia, 33, wife of the alleged gunman, was in good condition at a local hospital, CNN affiliate WESH reported. Jose Garcia Rodriguez, 57, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after fatally shooting another man at Melbourne Square mall, said Melbourne police Cmdr. Vincent Pryce, according to the station. That man was not identified. Witnesses described a chaotic scene as gunfire erupted around the food court Saturday morning. Many people were waiting for stores to open. ""We were right there,"" Donna Evans told CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13. ""We were right in the line of it. God is on my shoulder, whether people believe it or not."" Evans said she was carrying a food order when the shots rang out. ""It was a frightening experience,"" she told the station. ""It's something that you don't ever want anybody to experience. It was crazy. We had just gotten our food to sit down by Starbucks and Chick-fil-A and all of sudden you hear pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop."" ""You just drop everything,"" she added. ""Your body makes you run."" Elizabeth Tickle told WESH that she heard about six shots. ""I figured somebody was shooting somebody, she said. ""It's going on all the time now."" People ran for their lives, mall employee Brittany Brown told the station. ""I look up and a whole bunch of people are running, and they're saying, 'Run, run, run. People are shooting. People are dying,'"" she said. The motive for the shootings is under investigation, Pryce said. Rodriguez was allegedly armed with three handguns and handfuls of ammunition, Pryce said, WESH reported. The mall was expected to reopen Sunday, Pryce said. ""Officers quickly identified the threat and contained the situation,"" police said in a statement. ""Officers conducted a store-to-store search of the Mall for additional suspects, injured, witnesses and conducted an evacuation. No additional threats were located."" The wounded victim was cooperating in the investigation, according to the statement. A caller to 911 reported the shooting at about 9:30 a.m., police said.","Two people are dead in mall shooting, police say .

"Atlanta  (CNN)Two bodies, one male and one female, were recovered Monday in the case of a Marietta, Georgia, couple, who went missing after contacting a car seller on Craigslist. The bodies have not yet been identified, said Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson. He said the couple's car was also found submerged in a nearby lake. ""It's not the outcome we had hoped for but, obviously, it's the one we have to deal with,"" Steverson said. ""We'll analyze the vehicle, the bodies and hopefully we can come to some conclusion as to how they met their fate."" Earlier Monday, the suspect sought in the case who had posted a Craigslist ad turned himself in, the Telfair County Sheriff's Office said on its Facebook page. Authorities have said that Ronnie ""Jay"" Adrian Towns, 28, was wanted on charges of giving false statements and criminal attempt to commit theft by deception. His family was integral in securing his surrender, Steverson said. Elrey ""Bud"" Runion, 69, and his wife, June, 66, placed an ad looking for a 1966 Mustang on the advertisements website and contacted a car seller on Craigslist. They drove to the South Georgia town of McRae from Marietta, an Atlanta suburb, on Thursday to meet someone who responded to the ad, relatives said. No one has heard from them since. ""He was excited about the car. He had one when he got back from Vietnam,"" daughter Stephanie Bishop told CNN affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta. Asked whether Towns owned a Mustang like the one the Runions were looking for, Steverson replied, ""He does not. We feel that the entire communication he had with Mr. Runion was deceptive."" Relatives filed a missing persons report after the couple failed to show up to baby-sit their grandchildren the next day. Towns, 28, had the ""last known communications"" with Runion, Steverson said. Towns turned himself in just before noon Monday. He ""is currently in custody and no further details are available at this time. Details will be posted as they become available,"" the Facebook page for the Sheriff's Office said. It was unclear when his bond hearing would be held, Steverson said. The couple made the trip to look at the car, and once Runion got to Telfair County, the suspect communicated with him, according to the sheriff. He did not say who called whom. McRae is about 180 miles from Marietta. ""Early on in the investigation we did contact Mr. Towns, and we did interview him and by the information he provided we found it to be false and deceptive,"" the sheriff said shortly before Towns turned himself in. ""After we interviewed him, our efforts to contact him were unsuccessful. Today we've contacted his family, and they've been helpful in locating him."" For days, authorities searched for the couple using helicopters and watercraft, Steverson said. Deputies contacted land owners and hunters familiar with the area in case they had seen anything suspicious. The FBI and Georgia Bureau of Investigation assisted with the search. ""I am eternally grateful for the prayers that have been lifted up, the encouraging words, complete strangers who have reached out, we are so thankful for that,"" said Josh Patterson, the couple's son-in-law. ""Bud is a veteran. He and June are great people; they give so much, they are selfless."" The Runions were last seen driving a champagne 2003 GMC Envoy, which is the vehicle authorities have since recovered. Though the overwhelming majority of Craigslist transactions occur without incident, the site has a history of being co-opted by criminals. Just in recent years, there have been numerous such instances. In Henderson, Nevada, police said a man placing an ad in July met three men at a park, who took him to a vacant house, tied him up, beat and robbed him, then escaped in his car. In March, a San Jose, California, woman responding to an ad for a cellular phone was allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint by two men who drove her to an ATM and demanded her passcode, police told a newspaper. In May 2013, a Maine teenager drove to Portland to sell his BMW sedan to a 29-year-old who had responded to his Craigslist ad. The teen was allegedly forced into his own trunk and driven to Delaware, according to media reports and an FBI affidavit. HLN's Natisha Lance and CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","Suspect in case turned himself in Monday morning, authorities say .

"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, has some harsh words for the recently released Benghazi report, led by his own party. ""I think the report is full of crap,"" Graham told Gloria Borger on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""I don't believe that the report is accurate, given the role that Mike Morell (deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time) played in misleading the Congress on two different occasions. Why didn't the report say that?"" The investigative report Graham is referring to was released Friday by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, and Ranking Member Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland. The report finds little to support the questions that have been raised about CIA actions on the ground in Benghazi the night of the deadly attack on September 11, 2012. Graham, who has maintained a critical voice in the Benghazi controversy over the past two years, says it's ""garbage"" that the report finds no members of the Obama administration lied to cover up what happened in Benghazi. ""That's a bunch of garbage,"" Graham said. ""That's a complete bunch of garbage."" The investigation also found the security at the diplomatic outpost was weak and also described a ""flawed"" process used to create talking points for House members and for then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, whose public statements after the attack incensed critics who said the administration was trying to avoid calling the attack terrorism. ""When Susan Rice was on television after the attack, she said on three different occasions the consulate was strongly, and significantly secure,"" Graham said. ""Nothing could be further than that from the truth, and there's nothing in the talking points about the level of security."" To conclude, Graham says the findings of the report prove the House Intelligence Committee ""is doing a lousy job policing their own."" ""Anybody who has followed Benghazi at all knows that the CIA deputy director did not come forward to tell Congress what role he played in changing the talking points and the only way we knew he was involved is when he told a representative at the White House,"" Graham said. Asked why the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee would be ""buying a bunch of garbage,"" Graham simply replied, ""good question."" Graham said he is going to take another look at the findings of the report. ""I'm going to do a hard review of this.""","S.C. Republican Sen.

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)The embattled police here are testing something no other department in America has tried, in an effort to prevent another potentially explosive incident in which an officer kills an unarmed civilian. Ferguson police are evaluating a new attachment to their guns that could give a suspect a chance to live in an otherwise lethal encounter with police. This latest piece of weapons technology is called ""The Alternative,"" and it's an orange-colored plastic device mounted on a gun barrel that turns the first fired bullet into a pingpong ball-sized projectile, designed not to kill. Several officers have been trained on how to use it, but city officials have yet to decide on making the gear a requirement. ""It's something we're testing for ourselves and seeing if this is even something feasible or reasonable to use for law enforcement officers,"" Mayor James Knowles told CNN. The testing began just a week shy of the six-month anniversary of the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by then-Officer Darren Wilson, who is white and has since quit the force. The August police shooting sparked an intense, sometimes violent reaction from Ferguson residents, and demonstrations spread across the country. Protesters condemned police tactics as brutal and excessive against minorities, citing other police killings of black men, often unarmed. The new gun technology is being evaluated as a remedy to the simmering tension between police and community members. Local officials didn't want to speculate whether the device could have altered the outcome of the Brown-Wilson encounter. Wilson, who was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, told a grand jury that as he sat in his squad car, Brown, who was outside the vehicle, punched him in the face. Wilson fired multiple shots at Brown, killing him. When the gun is fired, the bullet embeds in a golf ball-sized metal bulb, attached at the muzzle. The bullet fuses inside the metal sphere, and the unit morphs into a speeding ball. Impact would be painful, but the projectile could be far less lethal than a naked bullet, the manufacturer said. Getting hit could break bones and even kill. ""It's gonna feel like you had a professional baseball player hit you in the chest with a hammer, so it is going to hurt,"" said Christian Ellis, the CEO of Alternative Ballistics. ""There is a possibility that this could kill you, but it is very slight when you compare that to a bullet."" His firm spent nine years developing the invention. ""It was actually created by a retired sheriff officer. He did not like the fact that people were being shot when the officers do have time (to consider options) but they had no other option in lethal force,"" Ellis said. ""So this product gives the officer another option in that scenario when it's not reactive, and they do have the time to put it on,"" he said, referring to mounting the device at the end of a gun barrel. The device, also called a docking unit, costs $45 and has a one-time use. It ejects itself from the muzzle after the police gun is fired. An officer can return to shooting again in a split second, and the bullets will be direct and unhampered. Ellis describes the technology as one more tool for an officer's belt. It provides an option that could spare the life of a threatening suspect. ""It's like an airbag for a bullet. So the risk is worth the reward to have an airbag in the car, and the risk is worth the reward if the officer can safely use our technology,"" he said. The device isn't without controversy. It could put an officer's life in danger, some retired law officers say. ""Our problem is not with the device, our problem is with the concept. This device ignores the human factor,"" said Charles ""Sid"" Heal, a retired member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and a consultant on alternatives to lethal force. He pointed out that The Alternative would be used in situations that could escalate with little warning, forcing officers to make yet another decision in a critical moment their lives may be on the line. ""When you're under a lot of stress, you lose your fine motor skills and, as a result of that, pulling a trigger and thinking are far more complex than most people realize,"" Heal said. Ellis understands the reluctance on the part of some departments to test the new technology, but he noted how other former law enforcement personnel have been helping develop the device. Ellis said the device is not for use when an officer must make a split-second decision, such as when a suspect pulls a gun. Rather, it's to be used when an officer has three or more seconds to decide. During that time, an officer can place the attachment on the gun while pointing it at a suspect. So far, The Alternative has never been tested on the human body, and it has not been used in real-life situations. Ferguson police have trained with the device on their shooting range, but it hasn't been taken or used on the streets. Mayor Knowles emphasized how his city continues to evaluate the technology. ""It hasn't been used by anyone else, which is why we are doing all of our due diligence, making sure it's properly tested, that it does not put anyone, especially our law enforcement, in any increased danger, and we'll just make a decision based on that,"" he said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Device mounted on a gun barrel turns a bullet into a golf ball-sized projectile .

"(CNN) -- Transit officials in San Francisco reopened all downtown subway stations Monday evening after successively opening and closing them to stem the threat of spreading protests. ""All BART Stations are Now Open, Trains Running On Time,"" said a release from Bay Area Rapid Transit. The situation was fluid most of the evening, with officials trying to thwart demonstrators, closing and reopening the Civic Center and Montgomery stations, closing the Powell station, then at least partially reopening Powell to allow riders to disembark. Police officers in response gear stood at the Civic Center station, with one officer on a megaphone telling people, ""This is your final warning, the station is closed."" On the streets, small groups of protesters could be seen gathering to criticize BART after several shootings involving its police officers -- the latest coming last month and resulting in the death of 45-year-old Charles Hill. Meanwhile, an official with the system stood by the decision to shut off cell phone service ahead of a protest last week. The decision Thursday to ""temporarily interrupt ... service at select BART stations as one of many tactics to ensure the safety of everyone on the platform"" drew widespread criticism and stirred the well-known hacking group Anonymous to stage an ""operation"" Sunday. The group urged those supporting its cause to attend a ""peaceful protest"" at 5 p.m. Monday at the system's Civic Center stop. ""What we're going to do is take the appropriate steps within the Constitution,"" he said. ""There are more constitutional rights than just free speech. There is the right to be safe."" Last week's protest never materialized. But the decision to cut cell service elicited fresh condemnations from civil liberty organizations, the San Francisco Chronicle's editorial page and others. ""All over the world people are using mobile devices to organize protests against repressive regimes, and we rightly criticize governments that respond by shutting down cell service, calling their actions anti-democratic and a violation of the rights to free expression and assembly,"" Rebecca Farmer from the ACLU's northern California office wrote on the advocacy group's website. ""Are we really willing to tolerate the same silencing of protest here in the United States?"" Online messages attributed to Anonymous took credit for the apparent hacking Sunday of myBART.org, a link off BART's website that showed a page featuring, among other items, the hacking group's logo -- a smirking mask above two crossed swords, all on a black background. In addition, Twitter traffic related to Anonymous boasted that hackers had been able to get into BART's internal network. Several related items and documents were posted, including one claiming to be ""the User Info Database of MyBart.gov."" This had e-mails and, in some cases, phone numbers and addresses of hundreds of people. ""By (cutting cell service), you have not only threatened your citizens' safety, you have also performed an act of censorship,"" a seemingly computer-generated voice -- speaking over dramatic music and images -- said in a video posted online Sunday afternoon. ""By doing this, you have angered Anonymous."" The Federal Communications Commission is collecting information on the matter, with agency spokesman Neil Grace saying Monday by e-mail that ""any time communications services are interrupted, we seek to assess the situation."" ""We ... will be taking steps to hear from stakeholders about the important issues those actions raised, including protecting public safety and ensuring the availability of communications networks,"" said Grace. Yet on Monday, Johnson emphatically stood by BART's move, made on the same day British Prime Minister David Cameron proposed a crackdown on social media to quell riots. ""We made a gut-wrenching decision that was forced upon us by the protesters,"" Johnson said. ""They made us choose between people's ability to use their mobile phones (and) their constitutional right to get from point A to point B."" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Trains are now running normally, BART says .

"Las Vegas (CNN)Tammy Meyers and Erich Nowsch were neighbors. Their homes are walking distance from each other and from a park. It was in that park where, according to Meyers' husband, she used to talk to the young man, where she implored him to act like an adult. On Thursday, Nowsch was arrested, accused of killing Meyers in what has been described as a road rage incident that ended a week ago with a shooting in front of Meyers' home. ""We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before,"" Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest. ""He knew where I lived. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends."" Nowsch, 19, faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle. A Monday morning court hearing has been scheduled. Robert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch. ""My wife spent countless hours at that park consoling this boy,"" he said. ""She was really good to him. She fed him, she gave him money. She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man. More times than I can count."" Police said they are looking for at least one more suspect, but they believe Nowsch was the shooter. Homicide Capt. Chris Tomaino told reporters that he owned registered firearms but wouldn't say how many guns or what type of weapons they were. It was unclear Thursday night whether Nowsch had an attorney; court documents detailing his charges didn't list a lawyer. Nowsch was taken into custody in the afternoon after a brief, tense standoff at his mother's home, which is one street over from the Meyers' house. Police have said the shooting followed a road-rage incident that took place last week near a junior high school where Meyers gave her 15-year-old daughter a night-time driving lesson. As Meyers drove the less than half mile home, a car sped by and her daughter reached over and honked at the driver. Police said the car stopped and the driver got out to confront the Meyerses. Robert Meyers told HLN's Nancy Grace on Thursday that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter. Tammy Meyers, 44, took off for home and sent her daughter inside. Lt. Ray Steiber, a Las Vegas homicide detective, said earlier this week that the daughter was asked to send her 22-year-old brother out. He brought with him a gun he owned. Steiber said Meyers then went looking for the road rage suspect, but, according to her husband, she just wanted to keep the situation away from the house. ""She just didn't want it to come back here. She tried to get him to go somewhere else,"" he said. Robert Meyers, who was out of town when his wife was shot, said the other car followed the Meyers and at some point away from the house there were gunshots. Tammy Meyers fled home and told her son to take cover as she parked in front of the house. The car -- with three people inside, the family has said -- approached. Meyers' son told police that they were fired upon, and he defended him and his mother. His father says he took three or four shots and found his mother mortally wounded. The father defended the family against criticism that they should have gone into the house when mother and daughter arrived after the road rage incident. ""My son is a good boy. His mom was a good mommy,"" Robert Meyers said. During a standoff at Nowsch's house earlier Thursday, Robert Meyers chastised reporters, whom he felt were placing blame on his loved ones. ""Are you all happy? You made my wife look like an animal ... and my son. There's the animal, a block away. Are you happy?"" Robert Meyers screamed. Police are looking for a second suspect, Tomaino, the homicide captain, said. He wouldn't say whether that person was the suspect depicted in a drawing handed out by police. The captain said authorities were unaware until Thursday that the Meyers family knew Nowsch. He is being held at the Clark County Detention Center. CNN's Sara Sidner reported from Las Vegas and Steve Almasy wrote this article in Atlanta.

"(CNN)A military operation in northern Cameroon has freed 24 of 80 people kidnapped by suspected Boko Haram militants, according to Cameroonian officials. On Sunday morning, the militants targeted the villages of Mabass and Makxy in the Mayo-Tsanaga division of Cameroon's Far North Region, razing more than 80 houses and taking captives. Three of those abducted were later found dead, state-run media reported. Mijiyawa Bakary, the regional governor, told CNN on Monday that soldiers from the Cameroon army's Mobile Intervention Battalion freed some of the captives during an operation against Boko Haram. ""The 24 people regained their freedom as the soldiers were chasing the Boko Haram militants. The insurgents were fleeing back to Nigeria from whence they came,"" he said. Col. Didier Badjeck, a Cameroonian Defense Ministry spokesman, confirmed the captives had been freed. Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said Sunday's mass abduction was the largest that Boko Haram has conducted inside Cameroon. The kidnappings came as some 2,000 Chadian troops arrived in Cameroon to help fight the insurgents. The deployment followed Cameroonian President Paul Biya's call for international cooperation in the fight against Boko Haram. Cameroon has already deployed about 7,000 troops across the Far North, where Boko Haram has scaled up attacks over the past six months. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. It has also kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in April -- and remain missing. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Initially, Boko Haram militants crossed the border into neighboring Cameroon to steal food or kidnap foreign nationals, but more recently the group has attacked military installations. While Chad is the first country to put boots on the ground in Cameroon, the international community and regional bodies are also expressing concern. The U.N. Security Council is expected to condemn Boko Haram by name in a strongly worded statement later Monday.","Suspected Boko Haram militants kidnapped 80 people from northern Cameroon .

"Wall Street is more than 10,000 miles away from Melbourne, but 24-year-old Australian Alex Gard felt a kinship to the outrage expressed on the streets of Manhattan. ""It's great that people are finally standing up against the privileged few people who want to rule together,"" Gard said. ""I wanted to stand together and say, `Enough is enough'."" Gard is one of the organizers of ""Occupy Melbourne,"" a group that started on Facebook that now has more than 2,000 members with plans to protest on October 15 in City Square. Similar calls have sprung up around Australia: ""Occupy Brisbane,"" ""Occupy Perth,"" and ""Occupy Sydney."" ""We are inspired by what's happening on Wall Street and loosely liaising with each other, but it's not organized in any central way,"" said Gard, who works as a mechanic on cargo ships. Gard and the planned Australian spin-offs of ""Occupy Wall Street"" are not alone. There are Facebook calls for a global demonstration on October 15 in cities in more than 25 countries stretching from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires, Dublin to Madrid. Some protest pages show only a few dozen will attend; others have thousands. Protest pages in Spain and Italy -- two countries hard hit by the financial crisis and subsequent European Union debt woes -- have the largest Facebook attendees so far, with 42,410 and 20,568, respectively. ""Occupy Wall Street"" began on September 17 and is now spreading to cities across the U.S. The demonstrations, inspired by the Arab Spring protest movement, are against economic inequality and power vested in the top 1% income earners. Its rallying cry, ""We are the 99 percent,"" is now being picked up by groups around the globe. ""Occupy the London Stock Exchange"" -- referring to Europe's largest bourse and the world's fourth largest exchange outside of New York and Tokyo -- has more than 6,000 followers. ""It's time that we too say, enough is enough. Bankers have got off scot-free whilst the people of this country are being punished for a crisis they did not create,"" said the group's Facebook invite page. The event, which so far has 2,300 signed up as attending, plans to occupy Paternoster Square from 4 p.m. October 15 to December 12. ""What we have in common is that we are the other 99%, that we want people over profit, that we are making our voices heard against greed and corruption and for a democratic and just society,"" London organizer James Alexander Fancourt told the Telegraph newspaper. ""And we are doing that in a non-violent and peaceful way."" In Melbourne, ""some demonstrators are planning to camp for days, maybe weeks,"" Gard said. While the Australian economy -- driven by strong commodity sales of iron ore and coal --escaped the brunt of the 2008 financial crisis, Gard said many Australians don't feel they're sharing in the wealth. ""Look, Australia's not the worst place in the world, but we're seeing banks recording record profits, rental has been crazy, housing prices are going up and up,"" Gar said. ""Indigenous people are being moved off their own land for the sake of mining companies ... everything is building up to a boiling point.""","Facebook calls for a global ""Occupy"" protest on October 15 similar to the Wall Street protests .

"Washington (CNN)Jim Webb has skipped the usual full Washington media tour since launching a presidential exploratory committee late last year. He has done fewer than a handful of interviews, given one high-profile speech and has shied away from attacking other Democrats who are considering a run in 2016. But that doesn't mean Webb has been silent on issues. Far from it. Webb, a 68-year-old former senator and secretary of the Navy, has been quietly outlining a 2016 platform -- on Twitter. For the last two-months, Webb has been tweeting about criminal justice reform, mental health issues and efforts to increase middle class incomes. He has urged the United States to reshape its drug policies and outlined his views on leadership. What's more, Webb has commented on news-of-the-day issues, like President Barack Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba, former New York Mario Cuomo's death and the release of Congress' report on torture. Webb plans to continue this Twitter-first strategy when he live tweets President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday, adding his observations and disagreements with the president in real time. While most of this has gone largely unscrutinized -- and Webb and his advisers are aware Twitter can't be the only way a presidential candidate outlines a message -- advisers said Webb's Twitter account is a fair representation of the platform Webb would run on if he chooses to jump into the race. ""We can un-paralyze the environment and re-establish a transparent, functioning governmental system,"" he said in December, linking to a number of policy positions on combating climate change. ""Why are so many Americans currently in prison compared with other countries and our own history,"" he asked this month. Webb's tweets are noticeably very different than most politician's tightly edited, concise messages. Some, frankly, don't make sense. But Webb's spokesman said the former senator writes all his own tweets and takes it ""very seriously."" ""It is not a bunch of propeller heads around him saying you should do that or this,"" said Craig Crawford, Webb's new communication's director whose hiring was announced on Twitter.

"Las Vegas (CNN)The man police have accused of gunning down a Las Vegas woman after an apparent road rage incident confided in two friends hours after the shooting that he had shot someone, according to a police report released Friday. The two friends told police that Erich Milton Nowsch had texted one of them after the incident and asked if he could come over. He said he had important news, one of the witnesses told police. Nowsch described two shootings to the friends and told them people in a green car were out to get him. One of the witnesses told investigators that the 19-year-old suspect said he ""got those kids. They were after me, and I got them."" Nowsch will be arraigned Monday morning and faces a growing number of charges, including one count of murder. The other charges include one count of attempted murder, three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and two counts of firing a gun from a car. Police said he shot Tammy Meyers, a 44-year-old mother of four, in front of her home on the night of February 12 after there was a confrontation while Meyers' was giving her daughter a driving lesson. The police report also says Nowsch had been detained Tuesday for an unrelated warrant that was issued while he was a juvenile. During questioning he told investigators he was with a friend at a recording studio and wasn't involved in shooting Meyers. But the friend told police the next day that he dropped Nowsch off at a park about 9:30 p.m. and they never went to a studio. Road rage suspect knew victim, husband says . Police found two shooting scenes: one near a junior high school and the other in front of the Meyers' home less than a half mile away. Six .45 caliber cartridge casings were picked up at the first scene. There were seven more .45 casings at the site of the killing, one .45 bullet with human blood on it, and three 9mm cartridge casings. Brandon Meyers, the 22 year-old son of Tammy Meyers, told police he had a Beretta 9mm handgun and fired after the shooter aimed at him and his mother, the report says. According to Nowsch's friends, Nowsch told them he was riding in a silver Audi sedan when he was threatened so he put a magazine in his handgun and shot at the green car. The Audi then followed the Meyers back to their house.  Nowsch claimed that he fired his gun 22 times while in front of the home, the report says. Nowsch showed the two friends his gun, some extra magazines and a box with more rounds, the witnesses told police. After the shooting the suspect and the person driving the Audi switched cars and the friend dropped him off at Santa Fe Station, a hotel and casino, the police report says. He then called and texted one of the witnesses and got a ride to their apartment. Nowsch told his friends he was sitting in a park when he saw a green car. He thought the people were looking for him. Apparently the car's driver was Kristal Meyers. She was driving a green 1993 Buick sedan around the adjacent parking lot at the junior high school, getting a driving lesson from her mother, the girl told police. Kristal Meyers also took a few loops around the block before switching seats with her mother. Tammy Meyers took an indirect route home and as she was on a six-lane road, a silver car pulled up next to them. Kristal Meyers told police she reached over and honked the horn. The driver of the other car then followed them as the Meyers turned twice before the other car passed them in a bicycle lane and stopped sideways in front of them. Kristal Meyers told police that the driver got out and yelled: ""I'm going to come back for you and your daughter."" The man was 6-feet tall, the daughter told police. Nowsch is much shorter. Police said Thursday they are looking for at least one more suspect in connection with the case. Critics have said that Tammy Meyers should have then gone home and gone inside to call police. Instead, when she arrived at the house she sent her daughter inside to get her son. Told that someone was threatening his mother and sister, Brandon Meyers went into his grandmother's room and grabbed his handgun. When he got to the car, Brandon Meyers told his mother ""to come in the house and call the police,"" he recounted to investigators. She insisted he come with her or she was going out alone, the police report says. The two drove around for a short time before encountering the gray car, the son said. They followed it and at some point the car stopped and the passenger shot at them. Brandon Meyers told police he ducked and didn't return fire. Tammy Meyers sped home and when she parked in front of the house, which is at the end of a cul-de-sac, Brandon Meyers got out and raced over to his mother. But before he could help her out, the silver car came down the street and the passenger shot at them. Brandon Meyers said he fired three times at the driver but didn't know if he hit anything. Tammy Meyers was struck in the head by the gunman in the Audi, police said. She died two days later at a hospital.

"(CNN)The leading vaccines for Ebola will soon be tested in healthy volunteers in Africa, according to the World Health Organization. At a press conference Friday, Marie-Paule Kieny, who leads the WHO Ebola vaccine work, suggested there has been real promise offered from initial tests of two of the vaccines being studied.  One comes from Merck and NewLink and the other is licensed by GlaxoSmithKline. Both vaccines have ""an acceptable safety profile"" meaning there are no adverse affects that would keep it from being tested in a broader population. Trials of the vaccines in Africa should start soon.  Health care workers will be among some of the first volunteers to be a part of this next stage of the test. Earlier the trial of the vaccine made by Merck and NewLink were stopped in December after some of the volunteers in the trial had ""transient mild"" joint pain.  After investigating that side effect, scientists concluded it was not a big enough issue to stop the development of the vaccine.  No similar side effects were noted in the other vaccine trial. There are other Ebola vaccines being tested by companies in the United States and in Russia. While the Ebola epidemic seems to be slowing, people are still dying infections continue. To date, there have been 19,340 cases with 7,518 deaths in the countries most impacted by the epidemic, according to the latest WHO report.","Leading vaccines for Ebola virus show early promise .

"(CNN) -- I am white. I know that's a terribly big surprise, considering that I write a blog called Stuff White People Like, but I mean it, I'm white. Like really white. I'm not attempting to assert some sort of superiority through my whiteness; quite the opposite actually. Thanks to my liberal upbringing, I am imbued with the appropriate amount of guilt and shame about my ancestors and their actions in the New World. Even in my home, I can't offer a blanket to a nonwhite friend without the fear that they will look at me and say ""no smallpox on this right?"" A joke, but I still want to apologize. I'm a white male. I belong to a group that pretty much always been able to own land and to vote. I'm more or less from the kind that grabbed power somewhere after the fall of Rome and never let go. In other words, I'm the kind of white guy that has never experienced any real oppression. Although I guess my ancestors technically left England because of some religious persecution and in spite of a rough boat ride and a rough first Thanksgiving, it's safe to say it worked out pretty well. Unless you got one of those aforementioned blankets. But in addition to being white and having ancestors on the Mayflower, I'm also Canadian. Yes, I know that might actually make me more white than before, but it also technically makes me an immigrant to this country. Still, I am loath to call myself an immigrant because I don't want to demean the very real, very difficult challenges faced by immigrants to this country who have had to overcome differences in language, culture and distance from their families. I would say my biggest hardship has been trying to find Ketchup Chips. But in the eyes of the U.S. government, I am an immigrant, the same as someone from China, Mexico or India. I would not be in this country had I not met my wife in graduate school, and I am thankful every day for her and the opportunity to live in the United States. So when the census came around, I was absolutely thrilled. I've lived in the United States for eight years (four of them as a graduate student), and in that time, I have never been able to vote or access any public services. The census meant I was going to be counted, I was going to be a part of American history. A good part, not that blanket part. When the form arrived, I scanned the options and quickly checked ""white."" I would have checked ""Canadian"" but that option wasn't anywhere to be found. There it was, I was a white American, or technically a white American Permanent Resident. But then I started thinking about what it really means to be a white American. As long as America has been around, I would have been considered white. I would have checked the same box in the 1790 census, had my relatives decided to stay on their land instead of moving to Canada to stay loyal to the King of England. But not everyone who checked that box on the census has always been considered white. Irish, Italian, Jewish, German and Eastern European have all been considered not white. or at the very least ""not American."" All of these groups came to America amid widespread discrimination, and yet through the process of assimilation and Americanization, the status of white was slowly conferred upon them (read ""The History of White People"" or ""How the Irish Became White"" for actual, intelligent research on how this happened). And with this new-found white status also came the status of ""ethnically American."" Of course, a lot of people will say that there is no such thing as an ethnic American and that everyone who becomes a citizen is an American. And this is true to the letter of the law, but if we consider the popular perception of immigration and the American dream, to say that white skin has nothing to do with it would be complete folly. In the popular myth, immigrants arrive as huddled masses yearning to be free and most of the women wear scarves around their head. They move to the Lower East Side or some other suitably ""ethnic"" community, they change a last name, they learn English and within one generation they are welcomed into the country as ethnic Americans and granted that wonderful privilege of checking the white box on the census. The reality is that America has a long history of welcoming immigrants who will never be able to check that white box on the census, and unfortunately that means America also has a long history of discrimination against those people regardless of their status in the country. Just one example would be the treatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II contrasted against the treatment of German-Americans. But all of that was in the past right? Well, ask yourself this: Who is more likely to get pulled over and forced to show his papers in Arizona today? A first generation Canadian immigrant, or a 10th generation Mexican-American? What I hope this census will force the country to deal with is the fact that white immigrants like me will never again make up the majority of people that come to this country. America is not getting whiter, it will never get whiter. Well, unless we start handing those blankets out again.

"The Supreme Court is used to having its decisions publicly criticized, but rarely in R-rated language spouted by a federal judge, who says the justices should just ""stfu."" The remarks come from Nebraska-based Judge Richard Kopf, who has a reputation for provocative commentary on his personal blog. Kopf, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, criticized the high court's ruling last week in the so-called ""Hobby Lobby"" case. The decision gave some for-profit businesses the right to deny birth control coverage to their employees if they opposed on religious grounds. The 5-4 decision against a provision of Obamacare was predictably divided in public opinion. The senior judge made clear his views on Saturday. ""Five male Justices of the Supreme Court, who are all members of the Catholic faith and who each were appointed by a President who hailed from the Republican party, decided that a huge corporation, with thousands of employees and gargantuan revenues, was a 'person' entitled to assert a religious objection to the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate because that corporation was 'closely held' by family members,"" he wrote. ""To the average person, the result looks stupid and smells worse."" And he went further. ""Next term is the time for the Supreme Court to go quiescent-- this term and several past terms has proven that the court is now causing more harm (division) to our democracy than good by deciding hot button cases that the court has the power to avoid. As the kids say, it is time for the Court to stfu."" Kopf helpfully linked to the Urban Dictionary to help decipher the popular acronym. It is not the first time his words have attracted attention on his blog, which he describes as enlightening ""the role of the federal trial judge."" During last year's budget battle in Washington and partial government shutdown, Kopf spoke for many federal judges in expressing frustration over forced furloughs and reduction of court services. But most judges hold their tongue on such matters, in an effort to appear above the fray. Not Kopf: ""Tell Congress to go to hell-- all federal court employees are essential."" And he was criticized for a March blog posting entitled: ""On being a dirty old man and how young women lawyers dress."" He later offered his regrets at the comments, saying, ""The only thing bigger than my ass is my ego."" There was no immediate reaction from the Supreme Court to Kopf's latest comments, and unclear whether the 68-year-old judge would be subject to some internal sanction. CNN spoke with Kopf's office, which had no comment other than to confirm the latest posting was his. Federal judges in particular have to adhere to a Code of Conduct, which says in part they ""should respect and comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary."" Moreover, it also says they must avoid even the appearance of impropriety. This prohibition covers professional and personal conduct. The wide-ranging and often deeply personal thoughts on Kopf's blog-- which he has authored since February 2013-- reflect what he says is a desire that ""federal trial judges be seen as individuals with all the strengths and weaknesses (baggage) that everyone else carries around."" In the wake of the ""stfu"" comment, he is again rethinking his online future. He wrote on Monday: ""Blogging will be light while I figure this out. While I will make up my own mind, advice (anonymous or otherwise), particularly from experienced lawyers and judges, would be welcome.""

"(CNN)In January 2014, 22-year old Redouane Hagaoui left his home in the Belgian town of Verviers. He was due to travel to Morocco to see his grandparents, but never arrived. Instead, Hagaoui went to Istanbul, called his family from somewhere in Turkey, and then vanished into Syria. His family and friends were stunned. One friend told the local newspaper SudInfo: ""He doesn't even speak Arabic very well."" On Friday, the day after Belgian police killed two extremists during a raid in Verviers, a CNN crew met Hagaoui's mother and sister at her home, just a few hundred yards from the scene of the shoot-out. At the time, Belgian media were suggesting he may have returned to Verviers and been killed in the police raid. They were too upset to talk; at that moment, they had no idea whether Redouane was alive or dead. The imam of the local mosque, Franck Hensch, told CNN they had not seen Redouane since 2013. He had been a serious but kind boy and had worked in a local restaurant, the imam said. Hensch and the president of the mosque M'Hamed Bouchlagham said that extremism was not common among Muslims in Verviers but that fewer young people were attending the mosque and instead were being influenced elsewhere. While the identities of the two men killed in the police raid have not been disclosed, it now seems Hagaoui is still alive and likely still in Syria or Iraq -- one of dozens of young Belgian men and women who have left their dreary, industrial towns to wage jihad in Iraq and Syria. A recent study by the Brookings Institution in Washington estimated that at least 250 individuals have left Belgium -- fewer than the number from Britain and France but the highest in Europe when measured per capita. Other sources put the number above 300. One of them posted a photograph of himself brandishing an automatic weapon and with an ammunition belt round his neck. Calling himself Fayssal Oussaih, he said he came from Maaseik, a small town on the Dutch border. He was reportedly the fourth resident of Maaseik to leave for Syria. Jihadists' travel tips . Another Belgian jihadist with a high profile is Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 27-year-old Belgian of Moroccan descent from a suburb of Brussels. An ISIS video posted in March last year shows him in a truck towing four dead bodies away in the aftermath of a massacre. Abaaoud's 13-year old brother also arrived in Syria later -- to become reputedly the youngest foreign fighter there. Belgian analyst and historian Pieter Van Ostaeyen says jihadists help each other with travel advice through social media. One posted on Facebook: ""Everything you need is available here, be it clothes or things for your home, we have everything."" And a tip: ""Don't behave like a warrior. Shave your beards, behave like tourists and buy tickets back and forth."" Precise figures on the number of Europeans who have gone to Iraq and Syria -- and which groups they have joined -- are hard to come by. The consensus among counter-terrorism analysts is that more than 3,000 have traveled, of whom 500 have returned, including up to 70 who have come back to Belgium. Of those who have gone, there appears to have been a sharp shift toward joining the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the last year. Van Ostaeyen writes: ""If there is one important difference between those who left during the first wave and the second it would be their favor to fight for the Islamic State."" And ISIS has made it clear it plans to send fighters to Europe, once western forces are, in its words, ""defeated"" in Iraq and Syria. An outlawed group called Sharia4Belgium is suspected of arranging the travel of some would-be jihadists. Nearly fifty of its members are currently on trial in Antwerp, but almost all are being tried in absentia. Guy Van Vlierden, an investigative journalist with Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws who tracks jihadist networks, told CNN that Sharia4Belgium had disbanded because of prosecutions and the flow of members to Syria. ""As an informal network though, I think it still exists. And from time to time, people try some kind of relaunch,"" Van Vlierden said. One of the group that went to fight is Azeddine Kbir Bounekoub, a Belgian-Moroccan from Antwerp in his twenties who is believed to be in Raqqa -- ISIS's self-declared capital -- and has a Facebook page in the name of Abu Gastbijshaam. After the attack on a Jewish museum in Belgium by a gunman accused of allegiance to ISIS, he wrote on Facebook page: ""May Allah raise up more young people who take the example of those who committed the attack in the Jewish museum."" ""Third generation"" Analysts of Islamist extremism in Europe talk of a ""third generation"" -- Muslim teenagers and men in their early twenties intensely alienated from the countries to which their parents and grandparents immigrated in hope of a better life. A significant minority among them feel marginalized within their own country (they have no experience of any other) and are enticed by ISIS's slick multilingual propaganda machine. Some even see the Kouachi brothers, who attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris as heroes; there were a number of incidents in French schools when the minute's silence for the victims was interrupted. One college teacher in a suburb of Paris with a high Muslim population told CNN that since the Paris attacks some Muslim students had adopted the slogan ""JeSuisKouachi,"" as a riposte to ""JeSuisCharlie."" Few of them will ever pack their bags, but they could easily be further radicalized at home. Most of those who do make it to Syria are raw recruits with few skills. But they learn fast -- and one worrying dimension of the conflict to Western analysts is the coming together of this ""third generation"" with veteran jihadists -- men like Abdelkader Hakimi. Now 48, Hakimi left prison in 2011 after serving a long terror sentence. He is thought to have trained in Afghanistan, and as a young man had been condemned to death in his native Morocco for trying to overthrow the monarchy. On Facebook last year he suggested he was in Aleppo, Syria. His current whereabouts are unknown. While European intelligence agencies scramble to tackle the first wave of returnees, some analysts offer a few crumbs of comfort. Among the hundreds who have followed their dream of jihad, some never imagine returning home. Yilmaz, a young Dutchman and former soldier, told a Dutch television network that he did not expect to come home, far less commit an attack in Holland. Others are killed or become suicide bombers; a few return home disillusioned with the violence. Tracking fighters . The Brookings study says the threat posed by foreign fighters could be reduced by better co-operation among European intelligence services. ""Intelligence from the communications of foreign fighters, shared open-source monitoring, and other information obtained by one service can prove crucial for discovering transnational networks,"" it says. Van Vlierden says that given their modest resources, the Belgian security services have been pioneers in tracking fighters. ""I truly think, for example, that the Jewish Museum attack wouldn't have happened with a perpetrator from Belgium itself,"" he told CNN. Four people were shot dead at the museum in Brussels last year. The alleged assailant -- a French national named Mehdi Nemmouche -- was arrested in France, highlighting the additional problem posed by Europe's open borders: 26 European states are part of the Schengen Agreement, which abolished passport and immigration controls between signatories. In Paris, analysts and former officers in the security services have long been critical of the lack of collaboration between France's police and the domestic and foreign intelligence services in the wake of the Paris attacks. That lack of communication became apparent after the Toulouse shootings in 2012, when Mohamed Merah killed seven people across several days in Toulouse. Governments in northern Europe now face threats on multiple fronts, from loosely-organized cells with ready access to weapons, and in many cases the expertise to use them. Last July Chams Eddine Zaougui and Peter van Ostaeyen warned in the New York Times that ""Policy makers' unrealistic obsession with foreign fighters could be a distraction from a more serious domestic terrorist threat."" The unfortunate lesson to be drawn from recent events in Paris and Belgium is that policy makers now need to focus on both.","At least 250 individuals are believed to have left Belgium to wage jihad in Iraq and Syria .

"Maybe it seems like the fastest way for a gadget-and-technology blogger to commit career suicide, but Paul Miller gave up the Internet at midnight Tuesday. Miller, who was and still is a senior editor at a tech news site called The Verge, plans to stay offline for a full year. When he needs to post something to the website that employs him, he will hand his editors a thumb drive with his stories saved in offline files. If he needs to look up a phone number, he'll get on the phone and start calling people -- who hopefully know people who know the person that he's trying to reach for an interview. There's no other way without access to professional websites and directories, he said. ""I'm going to try to use the six degrees of separation a little bit,"" he said on Tuesday afternoon in an interview -- by phone, of course. ""I have a lot of co-workers and they know a lot of people and so anybody I can get a phone number for I'll call that person and maybe they have a phone number for another person. So I'll have to follow that sort of chain."" Why go to all this trouble? For years, the idea of a digital sabbatical has appealed to the hyper-connected set -- people who spend most of their days in front of computer screens, checking blogs, reading Twitter and somehow trying to figure out how to get their work done in between. At the office, they dodge dozens of click-me-now messages per minute, each demanding instant attention. Even away from work, phones chime and vibrate to the point that, according to a market research study from Martin Lindstrom, the buzz of a vibrating phone is now one of the top three ""most powerful, affecting sounds"" -- after a baby giggling and the Intel chime, he wrote in The New York Times. Depending on your perspective, it may be either surprising or fitting that a technology blogger would get so caught up in the online tornado that he would quit, completely, and for a full year. On one hand, the Internet is Miller's passion and livelihood. ""I love the Internet,"" he said. ""It allows people to interact in really deep and meaningful ways and to create awesome things and do awesome things. I think it's a wonderful invention and I have no ill will against it."" But on the other hand, he also was semi-required to be online almost all the time. ""I've been on the Internet for the majority of the hours of my waking life,"" he says in a video posted on The Verge. Over the years, that started to take its toll. Longer-term, big-brainpower projects, like a sci-fi novel he's writing, fell to the wayside of quicker, easier distractions, he said. So he wants to try life without all that. ""I just want to know how it's impacting me and the parts of it that might not be good or might not be good for me,"" he said in the interview. ""That's why it's an experiment, not an indictment."" When I spoke with Miller, he'd only been off the Internet for about 12 hours. With that little time elapsed, it was of course impossible for him to pass broad judgments on his year-off-the-Internet plan. Before he pulled the plug, he said he ""really tried to overdose"" on all things Internet. He played several online games at once, responded to a flurry of Twitter messages and e-mails and joined a chat on Reddit, where some commenters questioned the value of his project, calling it a ""publicity stunt."" ""I have to recommend against it,"" one person wrote, saying he or she had tried a similar experiment a few years ago. ""... It became rather dull rather quickly."" At 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday he found himself in The Verge's office grappling with that potential for dullness. ""As soon as I unplugged I literally had nothing to do,"" he said. What he did was find co-workers who were playing video games (offline, so that's allowed). He joined them for a bit and then went back home, where he had an unusually long conversation with his roommate and listened to some records. They stayed up talking until 3 a.m., he said, and ""I was completely in the moment and having a good time."" That may not have happened with the Internet around, he said. Before he quit the Internet, Miller said his relationships were suffering because of his digital fixations: ""A lot of times I'm on a computer or I'm on my phone and I'm a little distracted by that. Sometimes I get frustrated at somebody that's trying to talk to me because maybe there's something I'm trying to complete on the computer and I'm trying to have the conversation. So I don't really do well at either thing."" Miller quit drinking cold turkey last year, and did the same when he wanted to give up gluten for a few months. It's easier to go all the way with something than to do it in phases, he said. He plans to spend much of his year reading some of the best books in history (he downloaded a list from a university's syllabus before the no-Internet deadline) and writing more. You can check back for updates on The Verge, where he will post diary entries about twice per week. And who knows, he said, maybe this will make a book. ""If this goes well I also want to write a book about my experiences without the Internet,"" he said, ""but so far I haven't had any experiences without the Internet."" Well, that's about to change.","Blogger Paul Miller from The Verge quits the Internet for a year .

"Beijing (CNN)Passengers who misbehave on commercial flights in China could soon find themselves grounded. After several highly publicized and embarrassing incidents of air rage, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said last week it is considering steps to blacklist offending passengers, according to state media. No final decision has been made on the proposed ""no fly list"" but it could lead to legal punishments. From hurling hot water at a flight attendant to fights over crying babies, outbursts by Chinese passengers have disrupted several flights in recent weeks --  both in China and further afield. In one of the most recent episodes, a flight departing a city in southwestern China was canceled after irate passengers opened three emergency exits following a seven-hour delay. James Fallows, aviation expert, journalist, and author of ""China Airborne"", says the flurry of angry episodes reveals growing pains in China's airline industry. Many newly prosperous travelers have never experienced the kind of travel headaches long familiar to the rest of us, he adds. ""It's a nation of first-generation air travelers,"" Fallows said. ""All of the indoctrination and beating down the rest of us have had now for decades about how you have to behave in airports and airliners is coming as a new experience to a lot of people in China."" Chronic delays . Chinese travelers also have to grapple with chronic delays in the country's busiest air hubs. Fallows blames much of the misery on the Chinese military, which controls the vast majority of the country's increasingly crowded airspace. Aviation authorities have opened new commercial flight routes in recent years in an effort to improve China's abysmal on-time performance record and the government has approved a second international airport in Beijing to ease the congestion  -- but these steps will take time to take effect. Fallows says Chinese culture also plays a role in the behavior of certain Chinese air travelers. ""It's perhaps the most individualistic country I've ever been in. It's every person for himself or herself,"" he says. ""We're seeing a lesson about how the people in China feel they have to behave.""","China is considering blacklisting unruly passengers .

"(CNN) -- If there was any actor who could make the entire family laugh, it was Robin Williams. His humor played perfectly to audiences of all ages, and for many of his younger admirers, Williams will be remembered as the funniest adult they knew growing up. It was nearly impossible to come of age in the '90s and not experience the magic of Williams' talent in movies like ""Hook,"" ""Jumanji"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" For those who have forgotten, take a trip down memory lane and revisit these roles on which Williams left his mark: . Sean Maguire in 'Good Will Hunting' (1997) What better way to start than with the film that won Robin Williams his first and only Academy Award? While ""Good Will Hunting"" is widely known as the film that started the careers of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, Williams makes a powerful impression as counselor Sean Maguire. Instead of the outrageously loud funnyman, here he showcases more a more subdued side of his acting chops. As Maguire, Williams perfectly encapsulated the type of man we look up to, a man who could change the way we think about life. Even when Williams wasn't making us laugh, he still made us smile. ""You can do anything you want, you are bound by nothing,"" his character says in the movie. A beautiful quote from a fantastic performance. Jack Powell in 'Jack' (1996) With a plot this outrageous it would take a miracle actor to pull it off. Luckily for director Francis Ford Coppola (yes you heard that right), he had the perfect man for the role of the main character, Jack. The movie tells the story of a boy with a unique aging disorder that has aged him four times faster than normal. He enters school in the fifth grade with the appearance of a 40-year-old man, and hilarity ensues. Could there be a better fit for Robin Williams' flawless combo of adult and youthful humor? Williams had an uncanny ability to make an audience laugh one minute and cry the next. While Jack's juvenile adventures through elementary school bring on the heavy laughs, he also breaks our hearts with his unrequited love for teacher Miss Marquez (Jennifer Lopez) and his tender relationship with his mother (Diane Lane). The film is pretty reflective of Williams' career in general -- even though he resembled a 40-year-old man, child audiences grew up with him. Peter Banning in 'Hook' (1991) In this twist on the Disney classic, Williams plays an adult Peter Pan who must return to Neverland to rescue his children, who were kidnapped by Captain Hook. The only thing more fun than watching Williams grow up in the body of an adult, as with ""Jack,"" is watching him reclaim his youthfulness. As Williams' Peter ventures to rescue his children, he inadvertently revisits his own childhood. Of course, he had a little help from Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) and Wendy (Maggie Smith), proving once again that Williams could be the star without stealing another actor's spotlight. And kudos to ""Hook"" for having the best food-fight scene of all time. Bang-a-rang Peter! John Keating in 'Dead Poets Society' (1989) One of Williams' most iconic roles, in ""Dead Poets Society"" Williams plays an English teacher who inspires his elite prep school students through the teaching of poetry. At first glance, it might not sound like your typical Robin Williams film, but, as always, he managed to throw in his own unique touch to the role. His vocal transformations in this part are dynamite: Who better to portray the voices in great poetry and literature? Williams was legendary for being able to play dozens of characters in one sitting, jumping from one to the next without missing a beat. With fans ranging from the older generations down to rebellious youths, never has the motto carpe diem resonated with so many. There's probably a person, right at this very moment, standing on top of a desk somewhere chanting ""O'Captain, My Captain"" in Williams' honor. Alan Parrish in 'Jumanji' (1995) Williams really had his work cut out for him with ""Jumanji,"" as he had to portray a boy who'd just been released back to the real world after 26 years stuck inside a jungle-themed board game. Upon his release, Williams' Alan Parrish is once again forced to play Jumanji alongside his former crush Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) and kid siblings Peter and Judy (a mini Kirsten Dunst!). As the game continues and the creatures of the jungle create mass destruction across the city, Williams takes the audience for a ride on the crazy train. While this could qualify as more of an action-adventure film as opposed to a comedy, there are always laughs when Williams is involved. The film was so popular it even spawned a real-life board game that no '90s kid could live without. Just be careful when you play: ""In the jungle you must wait, 'til the dice read five or eight."" Genie in 'Aladdin' (1992) We all know the tale: a street urchin falls in love with a princess and attempts to woo her into marrying him. Oh, and there's a blue, wise-cracking, singing genie that grants the poor man three wishes to win the princess' heart. Sure, Robin Williams doesn't have the title role in this animated classic, but he is without a doubt the most memorable part. In a film featuring a magic flying carpet, a nefarious screeching parrot and a smart-witted monkey sidekick, standing out can be a hard task. But not for Williams' scene-stealing Genie. Aladdin and Jasmine may have sung ""A Whole New World,"" but it was Williams' vocal abilities that had an opportunity to really shine here. Once his character is introduced, a large portion of ""Aladdin"" basically becomes a stand-up act for Williams, real improvisations included. Daniel Hillard and Mrs. Doubtfire in 'Mrs. Doubtfire' (1993) This film's plot could almost be a horror movie. After an ugly divorce, a man disguises himself as a female housekeeper named Mrs. Doubtfire in an attempt to sneak back into his home and spend more time with his children. But thanks to Williams' irresistible energy, this is a hilarious family-charmer. Brilliantly, Williams is able to make Mrs. Doubtfire her own individual character without ever letting the audience forget he is the one in the costume. While every other character is completely in the dark of her true identity, he gives the ultimate wink to viewers. The fact that ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is so often cited as a Williams favorite is a no-brainer given Williams' acting and comedic range. The film revolves around his impersonations, and he flawlessly flies through dozens throughout the film. Whether he was interviewing with a social worker for a job, receiving a makeover transformation from his lovable brother, or playing Euphegenia Doubtfire, this role helped Williams become an icon to every child of the '90s.

"(CNN)Tim Richmond's fascination with the American West began as a boy in England, watching cowboy movies on TV. ""The film 'Hud' with Paul Newman in 1963 or 'Bad Day at Black Rock' with Spencer Tracy ... and 'Junior Bonner' with Steve McQueen as a sort of rodeo rider,"" said Richmond. ""It seemed like another world from sort of drab England."" When he turned 17, Richmond headed to the United States, where he spent three months hitchhiking his way through the Western states. ""I just wanted to see things like I'd seen in films,"" he said. Richmond captures the solitude and expanse of places like central Wyoming and Montana in his latest photography project, ""Last Best Hiding Place,"" which releases in book format in June in the United Kingdom and in the fall in the United States. But don't expect any romanticized, idyllic scenes in his photography. ""I preferred the idea of actually slowly looking at the places away from perhaps Western art,"" he explained. ""Looking at the the sort of everyday side of things, which I find more interesting."" Richmond began the project seven years ago as the financial crisis began to unfold across the United States. He said he was surprised by ""the scale of development on halt in the towns outside Salt Lake City."" He named his photography series ""Last Best Hiding Place"" after a phrase he came across during his travels, referring to those living ""slightly under the radar"" in remote parts of the American West. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""Some of the parts in ... central Wyoming and central Montana, they are as remote as I've ever been,"" Richmond said. ""And when you're traveling 50 miles between almost just a gas station and that's it, it sort of changes one's viewpoint of scale and distance."" Richmond spent the early part of his career as a fashion photographer and taking portraits of actors including Ben Kingsley, Ian McKellen and Emma Thompson -- but his heart wasn't in it. ""I wasn't really thrilled by the idea of being a fashion photographer,"" Richmond said. ""After the death of my first wife, it just sort of taught me to do what you want to do, and I go 'OK I want to concentrate on this sort of work.'"" His images include people and places in faraway towns like Miles City, Montana; Deadwood, South Dakota; and Eureka, Utah. Often, Richmond would determine where he'd go next by pulling out a map and picking a town that had an interesting name. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. ""I remember looking in Utah one time and I came across this town -- I just thought, well it sounds really interesting and it's in the hills, and it's called Eureka,"" Richmond explained.  ""The story of the town itself is quite typical of a lot of those towns: it was nothing, no food, it grew huge and then slowly died off. ""(But) the thing that really fascinated me was the fact that this town was really hanging on ... everything just seemed to click in that town."" Richmond spent one summer traveling with a group of rodeo cowboys, captured in one image simply doing their laundry.  He said the biggest culture shock of his entire trip happened during the rodeo events. ""I was surprised by ... the sense that at rodeos, you have the whole idea of prayers. It's such an un-English thing. At any sort of sports event (in England) you wouldn't have a quiet moment and say the Lord's Prayer and 'God bless the troops' ... but out there it seemed absolutely standard."" Out of the thousands of images that he took, Richmond carefully selected ones he felt embody the real face of the American West. But he insists that his audience needs to ""create their own backstory"" about what they are witnessing in his photos. ""The place has to resonate with me ... there has to have some sort of lyricism or poetry about the image so people can see into it,"" he said. ""There's no story here so the pictures don't have to fit in ... these pictures  can float around a bit more, they don't have to fit with a strict text narrative.""

"(CNN) -- Only in the extreme world of big-mountain snowboarding could someone cheat death in an avalanche and realize it had reaffirmed their love of the powder. But perhaps it isn't surprising when Xavier de Le Rue describes his relationship with nature as a need, or a drug. It is also a synergy that provides solace in the wake of bitter disappointment, such as finding out your Winter Olympics dream is finally over. ""This huge avalanche took me 2 km down the mountain,"" the Frenchman tells CNN's Human to Hero series of the moment he feared nature had finally beaten him. ""It was one of these perfect days and you forget that in a split second, things can change radically and then, suddenly the whole mountain broke around me. ""It is a miracle that I survived because I was lying on top of six meters of snow, completely broken with blood coming out of every hole in my body and completely unconscious."" Unsurprisingly, that near-death experience six years ago launched a wave of introspection. ""I asked myself for months whether I should keep going or not, whether what I was doing was stupid,"" the 34-year-old says. ""I realized that I loved it even more than I thought and but I've always had these rules in my head to be more scared about everything all the time, but at the same time being a lot more focused. ""I think that right now, if I am freaked out about safety I will do no compromise. If I don't feel something, I'll just go back home."" De Le Rue's discipline is boardercross -- essentially, a race from the top of a mountain to the bottom between a clutch of snowboarders. He is a four-time world champion, a three-time winner of the overall World Cup title and has three X-Games gold medals to his name. The only thing missing from his portfolio of prizes is an Olympic medal, having fallen short in 2006 and in 2010. This particular dream is destined go unfulfilled -- after dedicating the past year of his life to making next month's Sochi Games, a mix-up over qualification points saw him fall short of the benchmark. ""It was really disappointing to get the news as this was going to be the end of my boardercross career,"" he explains. ""After four world champion titles, three X-Games medals and three crystal globes, it would have been an amazing way to leave the sport, but it has been a hell of a lot more brutal. ""The good thing about everything is that my true place in snowboarding, as well as my heart, is in the high mountains riding powder. I am more fit than ever, and I guess this blowup is a great way to start from scratch. ""I feel a lot lighter in a way, with no pressure. All that energy I have been gathering really makes me look towards my future adventures."" There are plenty more to come. Chief among them is continuing production on his own films, with expeditions to Spitsbergen, in Norway, and Alaska scheduled, as well as a commentary stint in Sochi. Watch de Le Rue's 'Mission Antarctic' It is clear this connection de Le Rue feels with the mountains is not something that can easily be shaken. ""Snowboarding is many things for me but most of all, snowboarding is what shapes my life in a way,"" he says. ""Snowboarding is what has taught me to know myself. ""Snowboarding is what has taken me to the most glorious times of my life but also to the worst times of my life. ""I think it's just my own tool to experience life, to push myself, to know my limits, to maybe go over my limits sometimes and to be a happy and fulfilled human being. See de Le Rue take on the planet's steepest peaks . ""If I'm in a big city for a while, I start to feel nervous and I know that I need to go back somewhere where there is nothing, where I can touch a tree or a rock or something and then I feel better."" De Le Rue thrives on the thrill of competition -- he describes boardercross as like ""motocross"" on the snow, as six people battle over a course filled with jumps and obstacles to reach the foot. But he is just as happy in splendid, snowy isolation on top of a mountain. ""You see those big mountains that are far away and so unreachable,"" he says. ""Ever since I started snowboarding and skiing, I looked at them and dreamed of getting up there and being up there on my own and even riding them. Yeah, the dream came true. ""I think if I had to describe one feeling that really stands out above everything; it's the one moment when you're at the top of the mountain, ready to drop in. ""You're on your own, you're far from everything, and you're in a really strong element. ""It's amazingly beautiful and there's something that happens in your head, it's like time doesn't matter anymore. Your daily problems just vanish and it's indescribable."" Born in the Pyrenees, De Le Rue started skiing at the tender age of two. His four brothers and sisters also took the slopes at a young age, and his brother Paul-Henri looks set to make the French team for Sochi. But though a medal at the Games was his final wish on the competitive side of the sport, he believes boardercross has evolved into a discipline that has maybe pushed the boundaries too far. ""I think now that the sport has changed,"" he says. ""The young guys are hungry and they're willing to win at any price. ""I'm going to sound like an old wise man but I miss the good old times where we used to respect lines, where we used to have a gentleman's code. ""Right now, it's just full battle with no rules, in a way."" But even if de Le Rue's boardercross days are over, there is plenty more big mountain snowboarding to be done. ""It's a way of kind of getting a bit of control over the mountains but still being humble, asking permission in a way to access it and to ride it and to get this huge immense pride and happiness at the bottom,"" he explained. ""Everything is recorded in your head and you just go into automatic mode. You're just in a sort of bubble and you don't feel anything, you're just like an animal. ""Once you've gone through all the hard bits and you're straight-lining down towards the end, you get this fire exploding inside you.""","Xavier de Le Rue is a boardercross snowboard world champion from France .

"(CNN)Prosecutor Alberto Nisman became a controversial figure when he accused Argentina's President and foreign minister of covering up Iran's involvement in a 1994 Buenos Aires bombing. On Sunday, hours before he was set to testify before the National Congress about his allegation, he was found dead in his apartment, the country's Ministry of Security said Monday. Nisman, 51, who had been investigating the Jewish community center bombing that occurred more than 20 years ago, was found in his bathroom with a .22-caliber gun and shell casing nearby, the ministry said. No cause of death has been released, but according to the Buenos Aires Herald, Security Secretary Sergio Berni and Anibal Fernández, secretary-general to the presidency, said there are signs that Nisman's death was a suicide. ""The forensic investigation is crucial. In forensic science, when you have a body, a cartridge and a weapon, everything leads to one place,"" Berni said, according to the newspaper. ""We have to wait for the judicial to confirm."" Buenos Aires police will conduct tests on Nisman's hands to see if there is gunpowder on them, the state-run Telam news agency reported. Such a test would be necessary to determine whether he committed suicide. ""As the days go by and we have the results from the autopsy, we will be able to determine the cause of death. I can't venture a hypothesis; that wouldn't be prudent,"" Viviana Fein, the federal prosecutor leading the investigation into Nisman's death, told reporters in Buenos Aires. ""I can confirm that there was a gun, a .22-caliber gun. I can confirm that he died due to a gunshot. I cannot confirm further details. I will find those out in the coming days."" Nisman's mother discovered his body shortly before midnight. The prosecutor had been under the protection of a 10-man security detail, members of which belonged to the Federal Police. The detail called his secretary Sunday afternoon to say he wasn't answering his phone, Telam reported. When he didn't answer his doorbell and his Sunday newspaper was found on his doorstep, the security detail reached out to his family. The detail took Nisman's mother to his apartment in Le Parc Tower, a high-rise in the Puerto Madero neighborhood of Buenos Aires, and upon finding the door locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock, Nisman's relatives reached out to a locksmith, the agency reported. Nisman's mother and a guard later found the prosecutor's body blocking a bathroom door inside his room, Telam said. Nisman was set to testify to lawmakers behind closed doors on a report alleging that President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner,  Foreign Minister Héctor Timerman and other officials had covered up Iran's involvement in the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association building. The attack killed 85 people and wounded more than 300. Fernández de Kirchner and Timerman wanted to cover up Iran's involvement in order to boost trade -- specifically, oil imports and grain exports -- with the Islamic republic, Nisman alleged last week, according to the Herald. Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers Jorge Capitanich told CNN and other media outlets that Nisman's allegation is ""crazy, absurd, illogical, irrational, ridiculous, unconstitutional."" Timerman also formally rejected the accusations last week. Appointed in 2004 by Fernández de Kirchner's late husband, then-President Néstor Kirchner, Nisman told members of the Argentine opposition that he had documents to back his allegations, the Herald reported. He was also expected to divulge sources for his research. Congresswoman Patricia Bullrich, who represents Buenos Aires in the National Congress' lower house and who organized the hearing, said she spoke with Nisman on Saturday. ""He said he was very threatened and he knew that this was a very heavy topic,"" she said. ""I am very dismayed."" Argentine prosecutors have long accused Iran of involvement in the bombing and requested the arrest of Iranian citizens in connection with it, among them former Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi, former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohsen Rezaie, head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard at the time of the attack. Iran has denied the charges. In 2013, Argentine lawmakers approved the creation of a ""truth commission"" designed to investigate the bombing in conjunction with Iran. The National Criminal Court is investigating Nisman's death, the Security Ministry said. His body has been sent to a morgue for autopsy, Capitanich told CNN. Israel's Foreign Ministry, in a statement to media outlets, called Nisman a ""brave and prominent jurist who fought ceaselessly for justice"" as he worked to expose those behind the 1994 attack. ""The State of Israel voices hope that Argentine authorities will continue with Nisman's activities and make every effort to exact justice on those responsible for the terrorist attacks in Argentina,"" the statement said. The Anti-Defamation League called for a full and transparent investigation into Nisman's death, which it labeled ""another tragic episode that will extend the decades-long delays in bringing the Iranian masterminds and perpetrators to justice."" ""The timing and circumstances of Mr. Nisman's death, coming just days after he released detailed allegations of high-level government attempts to evade his investigation and hours before he was scheduled to present additional details to members of the Argentine Congress, raise serious questions about whether Mr. Nisman's death was related to his work on the AMIA bombing,"" ADL National Director Abraham Foxman said in a statement. CNN's Michael Pearson, Iván Pérez Sarmenti, Elwyn Lopez and Robert Lenz contributed to this report.","Prosecutor Alberto Nisman blamed Iran for the 1994 bombing, which left 85 dead .
He also alleged that top Argentine officials had worked to cover up Iran's involvement .
Some officials have said Nisman's death appears to be suicide; a probe is underway ."
"(CNN)The parents of Kendrick Johnson, 17, never believed their son died accidentally after getting stuck upside down in the center of a rolled gym mat while reaching for a shoe. ""We know who killed him. We just have to prove it,"" Johnson's mother, Jacquelyn Johnson, told CNN. Now, attorneys for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson have filed a wide-ranging, $100 million lawsuit that claims several former classmates beat their son to death inside the old gym at his south Georgia high school in January 2013.  The suit names 37 people, mostly members of local law enforcement, plus the city of Valdosta as defendants. The four-count lawsuit was filed Monday in Superior Court of DeKalb County in metro Atlanta, more than 200 miles from Lowndes County, where Johnson was found dead January 11, 2013.  The Georgia Bureau of Investigation's headquarters is in DeKalb County. In the filing, attorneys claim Johnson was ""induced"" by a female student to go to the old gym at Lowndes High School on January 10, 2013.  Attorneys do not name the female student. Attorneys accuse two former schoolmates, who are brothers, and their father, who is a local FBI agent, of wrongful death.  Attorneys claim that the brothers ""violently assaulted"" Johnson in response to their father's command and that Johnson ""suffered a fatal injury which led to his death.""  A third former schoolmate is also accused, as well as John Does and Jane Does. The students then put Johnson's body in the center of the gym mat and placed it in the corner, the suit alleges.  Only the defendants in the wrongful death claim are being sued for ""at least"" $100 million.  Defendants in the remaining three claims are being sued for undetermined punitive damages. ""This is yet another frivolous lawsuit filed by [the Johnson's attorney] Chevene King in connection with the death of Kendrick Johnson. It contains allegations against [my clients] that he and his clients know are untrue and defamatory,"" Brice Ladson, attorney for the FBI agent's family, wrote in a statement to CNN. The FBI agent and his sons have all received letters informing them they are targets of an ongoing investigation into Johnson's death by the Department of Justice, according to Ladson. ""[The agent] remains actively and fully engaged in his duties as an FBI special agent,"" Atlanta Special Agent in Charge J. Britt Johnson wrote in a statement to CNN. After a nearly four-month investigation and more than 100 interviews, the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office concluded that no foul play was involved in Johnson's death. In May 2013, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation released its autopsy report, which supported the investigators' conclusion and determined the cause of Johnson's death was accidental positional asphyxia. The case was closed. ""We examined all the alternatives that were presented to us.  The only one that fit the physical evidence and the forensic evidence and the testimony that we received was this was an accident,"" Lowndes County Sheriff's Office Lt. Stryde Jones told CNN soon after the case was closed. In June 2013, Johnson's body was exhumed.  Johnson's parents hired Florida-based forensic pathologist Dr. William Anderson, who found evidence of ""unexplained, apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma"" to Johnson's neck.  Anderson determined Johnson's death was the result of a homicide. 7 judges say they can't be fair . In the lawsuit, attorneys for the Johnsons accuse employees of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office, the city of Valdosta, the Valdosta Police Department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation of violating Johnson's right to due process and equal protection under the law. The attorneys allege the defendants conducted an investigation that was designed to ""maliciously cover up the less-than-adequate effort"" to investigate Johnson's death and to ""cover up the identities of those individuals responsible"" for killing Johnson. Additionally, the city of Valdosta, Valdosta City Police Chief Frank Simons and Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan have been accused of failing to properly hire, train and supervise members of their respective agencies and departments. The Valdosta-Lowndes Regional Crime Laboratory, which collected and tested evidence at in the gym, is managed by the city of Valdosta. Attorneys claim ""various law enforcement agencies deliberately and maliciously mishandled the ... investigation in such a way that anyone who might ever be charged with [Johnson's] death would never be convicted due to a patently flawed investigation."" Coroner slams handling of Kendrick Johnson case . All defendants are accused of intentionally inflicting emotional distress on Johnson's parents. ""We have received and reviewed the complaint filed in DeKalb Superior Court by the Johnsons and their lawyer against 38 named defendants including 17 Lowndes County Sheriff's Office personnel. The accusations made against Sheriff [Chris] Prine and his officers are unfounded and lack any basis in law or in fact.  We will respond further to these baseless accusations through the courts,"" Jim Elliott, attorney for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office, wrote in a statement to CNN. ""The city of Valdosta does not typically comment on pending litigation.  However, based upon the sensational nature of the allegations being made, the city, and the employees named, categorically deny all allegations of wrongdoing and consider the claims to be meritless.  The city looks forward to defending itself in a court of law,"" Valdosta City Manager Larry Hanson wrote in a statement to CNN. An attorney representing Lowndes County Schools had no comment. Several calls made and emails sent to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for comment have not been returned. Attorneys for Johnson's parents made similar claims by amending a 2013 lawsuit against Sheriff Prine and Lowndes County Schools in the Superior Court of Lowndes County on Friday. In 2013, a judge granted CNN's request to intervene in the suit filed in Lowndes County related to claims of violations to Georgia's Open Records Law.","Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in 2013 in an old rolled gym mat .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Government forces and rebels in Yemen agreed to a ceasefire Monday after heavy fighting in the capital, Sanaa, Yemen's interior minister and a rebel official said. That news came after fighting around the presidential palace and came after Yemen's prime minister went into hiding when attackers shot at him. Nine people were killed and 67 others injured iin the clashes, Yemen's Health Ministry said. The Yemeni government, a U.S. ally in the battle against al Qaeda, described the fighting as a power grab by rebels known as Houthis, Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country. Turmoil between the two sides is worrisome to the West because a power vacuum in Yemen could benefit al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terrorist organization based in Yemen that took credit for the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris; it also tried to blow up a plane landing in Detroit in 2009. A Houthi delegate, Ali Daghshan, told CNN that the presidential committee had agreed to a deal after hours of negotiations. Interior Minister Jalal Al Rowaishan also confirmed the ceasefire had been reached. There are conflicting accounts of the cause of the clashes. Government officials characterize it as a power grab by the Houthis. Houthis say Yemen's military attacked people demanding that authorities lift road closures introduced as a security measure after the presidential chief of staff was abducted in Sanaa a few days ago. A Western diplomat in Sanaa told CNN the situation was complex. ""Today's events appear to be the next stage in Houthi plans to extend their control in Yemen. But there are many players with many agendas. So this hasn't finished playing out,"" the diplomat said. It is unclear who fired first near the presidential palace Monday. Control of the palace is seen as key to the control of the country. There were reports of government buildings, a hospital and residential buildings being hit. The presidential palace is controlled by the government and mountaintops surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as Houthis, a senior interior ministry official told CNN late Monday. Both sides will remain where they are until a deal is signed, which is expected to happen Tuesday, said the official. The Yemeni information minister told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that government control is ""almost nonexistent."" When asked to described the situation on the ground, Nadia Al-Sakkaf said: ""This is almost a replica of what happened in September, on the 21st of September, when the Houthis came into the city and took over everything, and then there was the peace and partnership agreement, where they pulled back a little bit and allowed a government to be created."" ""Now, since then, the Houthis have not really left the capital. They've been around with their arms, and what happened is that they've been interfering in the government's work, but we were trying to get this country going,"" the minister said. The U.N. Security Council will hold a special meeting to discuss Yemen on Tuesday. Prime Minister Khaled Bahah was fired upon when he left a meeting with President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Houthi political group Ansarallah, Al-Sakkaf said. Bahah was unharmed and is now in hiding, she said. ""He is at his place, but currently he has been surrounded by Houthi militias around his place, and they have stationed themselves at rooftops of neighboring buildings. He is worried that the situation might escalate,"" said the minister. The senior interior ministry official said the prime minister was inside the Republican palace, some 7 miles (12 kilometers) from the presidential palace. The gunfire came from a Houthi checkpoint near the meeting place, and the attempt to kill the prime minister was a breach on an earlier ceasefire, Al-Sakkaf said. But a senior Houthi official condemned the attack and denied the group had anything to do with it, blaming the attempt on an unnamed third party. Houthis said their convoy had also been fired upon after leaving the talks. Adding to the disputes, the information minister said Yemeni state TV and the state-run Saba news agency are now under the control of the Houthi political movement. But senior Houthi official Ali AlShami denied the movement controlled either news outlet. There are concerns that as Yemen spirals into greater sectarian violence, al Qaeda, a predominantly Sunni group, will gain an even greater foothold there, with more recruits and a base from which to attack other targets. ""This morning, it was so chaotic. They said that nobody knew what was going on and who was in charge, and these are situations where al Qaeda can easily infiltrate and create,"" Al-Sakkaf told CNN. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has its home in Yemen, where in recent months, it has come under pressure from Houthi rebels and government forces. But the Charlie Hebdo attack may show the group's apparent ability to direct operations beyond Yemen's borders. It is thought likely that one or both of the brothers behind the attack in Paris visited Yemen and received weapons training from AQAP and that one may have met with the group's former leader. A U.S. official said the United States was monitoring the violence Monday and had sufficient military power nearby to evacuate its embassy ""on short notice"" if needed. Al-Sakkaf said gunmen linked to the Houthi political movement attacked the presidential palace in a bid to take control of the symbol of power. Hadi, the President, was not in the building and is safe, Al-Sakkaf said, but government officials were among an unknown number of casualties. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility Saturday for the abduction of presidential Chief of Staff Ahmed bin Mubarak. Al-Sakkaf said Monday's dispute began when the government tried to implement a security plan as it feared more abductions of key staff. But a top Houthi official said Houthis tried to mediate with the army and asked for roads to be opened for citizens, which led to their people getting attacked. He said they then had to defend themselves. Hadi appointed bin Mubarak as premier in October, but the rebels rejected the nomination. Osama Sari, senior media adviser to the Houthi movement in Yemen, said the Houthis had detained bin Mubarak as a message to the President. It was because the President wanted to introduce a new constitution without the approval of the Houthis, Sari said. The abduction came amid increased tensions in the Arabian Peninsula country after the rise of Shiite Houthi rebels. Houthis swept into the capital last year, sparking battles that left more than 300 dead in a month. In September, Houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government. Since then, its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions. Hadi was elected President in February 2012. He was the only candidate on the ballot.

"Manila (CNN)Manila on a normal day is not easy to manage. Throw in Pope Francis, a mass for six million people and some rain, and you can expect some disorder and confusion. However, what I experienced showed me the better side of what Filipinos and the Philippines can be. Before the Mass, the streets lining the main boulevard where the pope's motorcades would pass en route to Rizal Park, were already lined thick with people who had arrived by dawn, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pontiff.  ""The pope is a human saint -- when we see him our problems go away,"" said 35-year-old Evangeline Dion. Rick Felajo, 54, who had followed the Pope to every event in Manila said that, even if he did not manage to see him personally, he feels he'd feel ""blessed"" just to be near him. ""For me, he is the super Pope because he is very human and helpful. I want to follow his example. And he is the ultimate guide to the path to heaven,"" Felajo explained. Ex-street kid weeps as she asks Pope why God lets children suffer . When the Popemobile finally drove by, the air was filled with cheers, jubilant screams and applause. Fifteen-year old Brenda Ganabban told me, ""I felt happy, even if just for a moment. I saw him smiling, waving his hands at us. I know he probably won't remember but I will remember him."" For a hot and humid country used to heavy tropical rain, standing outside in the elements for hours didn't seem to be a problem. Soaking wet by lunchtime, everyone was still smiling and happy. Joey Stefona, 55, who had stood in the rain for five hours, explained, ""I feel like it's shining, it's really warm. I don't feel the rain."" The weather also brought out the Filipinos' innate creativity and resourcefulness; having listened to the advisory against bringing umbrellas, those who did not have raincoats wore every form of plastic imaginable. People protected their heads with towels, helmets and even shower caps, and bubble wrap and trash bags were fashioned into scarves, hats, shirts and overdresses. Thousands of faithful, having found the main venue packed to capacity, wandered around the carnival-like atmosphere, passing souvenir and snack vendors, and people waving porcelain, wood or ceramic religious figures, in search of somewhere to stand and pray. At times, the massive flow of people pushed me into a crowd moving in two directions at once with enough room to move only inches forward at a time. But despite this, people remained kind and helpful. When I found it impossible to shoot a colleague on video because throngs of people were passing by nonstop, one lady offered to hold my umbrella over the camera, and another volunteered to direct people around us as we filmed. No matter where you looked on nearby Roxas Boulevard, usually a traffic-filled main artery, the spirit in the air was ordered and peaceful. Hundreds of thousands of people lined up calmly behind police barricades before, during and after the Mass, showing a patience and humility that made me proud. They were here, united in purpose, because they believed, and faith knows no clock. From the altar, surrounded by screens, the Pope told the massive congregation that God ""created the world as a beautiful garden and asked us to care for it."" Though, he said, through sin, ""man has also destroyed the unity and beauty of our human family, creating social structures which perpetuate poverty, ignorance and corruption."" The people around me said they hoped the Pope's visit would start to heal what one lady described as the ""illness of the country."" Lucy Ripalda, a high school teacher said, ""Our government officials should have the integrity and the wisdom to govern our country well without corruption without taking advantage of small people, the simple people."" Seaman Joey Stefona, 55, proudly carrying a carved ""Santo Nino"" icon in his arm, offered another prayer. ""I hope he can help with poverty, those who are having a hard time. They need jobs, better living conditions, and a better future for our children."" As the majestic sound of the church singing echoed through the streets, I looked at the silent faces of those bowing their heads in contemplation. I could not but feel a sense of unity in the moment. Rodolfo Gannabran, a 65-year old retired Army officer who traveled 13 hours by bus to see the Pope, said: ""Today I feel there is peace and tranquility among Filipino people or any other race present here at this moment. I feel so happy. It should be carried on.""","Around six million Catholics crowd Manila streets to glimpse the Pope .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Monday through Saturday John Harris holds court at the Silver Moon Barber Shop on Auburn Avenue. There, amid the whirring fans and TV soaps, he greets clients, many he's known for decades. Cutting hair is a family trade, one he took up after serving in the Army. It puts food on the table, he says, but more important, it affords Harris the opportunity to visit with people. In between clients, he sits reading the paper, looking up to share words with passers-by. Silver Moon opened in 1904. It was one among many businesses run by African-Americans, for African-Americans, along Auburn Avenue. During the period of segregation this street was called the ""richest Negro street in the world."" The street existed because of the bleak realities of segregation, but in those days the corridor had a vibrant feel. ""This was a street full of people on Friday and Saturday nights. If you were in a car it would take you perhaps 15 or 20 minutes to go a block,"" recalls Wellington Cox Howard, a small-business owner on Auburn Avenue. When Howard first arrived in Atlanta in the 1960s he made a beeline for the street. He had his first meal on Auburn, resided on the street, and when he graduated from college in 1970s, he decided to open his insurance business there. But by that time, change had already arrived on Auburn. Howard recalls telling a friend about his decision to open up shop there. ""He said why do you want to go to Auburn Avenue? He said the city has integrated. He said we've all left."" Before integration, Howard says, Auburn was a city unto itself. African-Americans would come here for doctor's appointments, they'd come for entertainment, they'd come for banking and to start large construction projects. When integration came, African-American businesses spread throughout the city and the corridor lost much of its vibrancy. This year, for the second time, the Sweet Auburn District was listed as endangered by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a private nonprofit organization. This designation does not mean automatic funding for improvements, but the group says the attention often galvanizes efforts at preservation. Sweet Auburn's designation is somewhat unusual, because sites normally aren't listed more than once. Since the initial designation, residential options have improved on the corridor, the group said, but ""the commercial area concentrated on Auburn Avenue has not fared as well."" The concern is that without greater resources devoted to planning and preservation, many buildings could be lost along with the history they hold. Along the corridor, news of the designation passed with mostly tepid curiosity. About a half-dozen local business owners CNN spoke to expressed surprise about the news but remained hopeful. Many spoke about recent positive changes they've seen, like a streetcar project that's breaking ground with federal funds, and wondered whether the designation might spur more positive changes. Councilman Kwanza Hall, who represents this district, has taken the news quite seriously. Hall, whose parents were civil rights leaders, spent many days on Auburn as a child. ""There's a very rich treasure in terms of African-American history,"" Hall said, rattling off a long list of buildings and their historical significance. For Hall the endangered designation necessitates a big response. He calls it a ""Marshall Plan"": a concept to revitalize the community by bringing all the disparate interests on board. But Hall is not naÃ¯ve. ""It's not easy to move multiple entities, all who have their own boards and organizational goals that are sometimes in conflict,"" he said. Hall is well aware that for historic preservation to get buy-in from existing landowners, there must be a clear incentive for everyone. Up and down the street that message is well-received. Owners of new and old businesses alike stressed the need to respect history but not to let it get in the way of progress. Windsor Jones, who owns Sweet Auburn Bread Co. with his mother, said they'd moved to the street five years ago because of the history. The bakery routinely gets tourists wandering down from the Martin Luther King Jr. Center, a major point of pride for the business that turns out muffins and sweet potato cheesecake. Also nearby are the home were King was born and Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he was pastor. Still, doing business on this street has drawbacks. Jones shoos away a woman asking for change as he squints out the window looking at the ruins of a building across the street. ""They've already torn down some buildings,"" he says, ""and I understand why they want to save some, but some of them are eyesores."" Around the corner from Jones's bakery, a lush green garden provides a vivid picture of how the legacy of this corridor can live on even with radical change. Rashid Nuri and Eugene Cooke run the space here known as Wheat Street Gardens, and turn out beautiful organic produce. The small but productive farm bustles with activity. There's a summer camp here and the garden just got funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to train urban farmers. Cooke pauses from a lesson in harvesting to explain how their work fits in with the area's history. ""Every human definitely deserves to eat good food, so it is absolutely in that lineage of human rights issues,"" he says. This view is reinforced by the landscape. Beyond the rows of peppers and sunflowers, historic buildings peek out, buildings that keep Cooke focused on his mission of spreading social justice through good food. Despite the visible challenges on this street -- the empty storefronts and a handful of rundown buildings -- Hall says he thinks this is actually a good time for Auburn. It's a view shared by many who work on the street every day. Right now, federal dollars are flowing in for the streetcar project, and many see the future for this street with the neighboring Georgia State University continuing to expand its downtown footprint. Hall says now is the time to move forward with new projects while keeping alive the memories of this street's role during segregation, and its famous residents' roles in ending it. Mary Alex Romero and Caleigh Derreberry and CNN's Gavin Godfrey and Jon Binder contributed to this report.","Auburn Avenue in Atlanta is a historic African-American business and cultural hub .

"Hong Kong (CNN)A court in Hong Kong has thrown out an application for a 14-year-old girl to be removed from her family after she was arrested for drawing chalk flowers on a wall at a pro-democracy protest site in Hong Kong. The girl was caught in the early hours of December 23 at a staircase -- known as the ""Lennon Wall"" -- leading to the Central Government Offices in the city's Admiralty district and was detained by police for 17 hours. They then applied to have the girl taken into care. But Magistrate Winnie Lau Yee-wan rejected this. ""I can understand why the police made the application,"" she told journalists outside the court Monday, according to local media. ""After reading the social worker's report, I find that it is not necessary to grant the child protection order at this stage."" Reports of the arrest and the care and protection order application attracted widespread criticism among protestors as such applications are usually made by the Social Welfare Department, not the police, and are usually made in cases where a child is at risk. When an application for a care and protection order is made, the social welfare department is expected to produce a report assessing the needs and the care of the children or juveniles involved. A spokesperson from the Social Welfare Department told CNN that all court cases in Hong Kong are open, however a court can decide not to disclose information in cases where the identity of a minor needs to be protected. The spokesperson added that the department's Integrated Family Service Center would continue to monitor the case and provide the appropriate support and services to the girl and her family. But Gary Tsang, who participated in Hong Kong's pro-democracy street occupations, told CNN earlier this month that the teen was ""an innocent political prisoner"" and the use of the law in this case was ""obviously politically motivated."" Street becomes canvas for 'silent protest' in Hong Kong . Protest support . The Lennon Wall became a focal point for messages of support for the recent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. When the protests were cleared, the messages -- hundreds of post-it notes -- were removed as well. Protesters started placing notes on the wall as a show of defiance after police used tear gas on demonstrators at the start of the protest, which led to a two-month occupation of the main road outside the Central Government Office. The wall was named after the late Beatles star John Lennon and contained messages of support for the protests and references to his song ""Imagine."" The girl -- widely known as ""chalk girl"" -- told local newspaper Ming Pao Daily earlier this month that she did not regret getting involved with the protests and urged activists not to give up. Last week, police withdrew an application for a care and protection order for a 14-year-old boy last week. The boy was arrested during the police clear out of the Mong Kok protest site last year. The court file said the boy's parents failed to exercise proper guardianship over him. Continued resistance . A small protest camp outside the Legislative Council still remains and there is a small police presence on the site. Police officers are guarding Lennon Wall and remove all notes posted to it at the end of each day. Since the protest sites were cleared, demonstrators have resorted to other forms of protest such as the so-called ""shopping revolution,"" which involves protestors blocking the sidewalks and flooding shopping districts every night with yellow umbrellas. Thirty protest leaders, including the three founders of Occupy Central with Love and Peace and several prominent student leaders, have been called by the police to report to the police headquarters in Wan Chai district, where they could possibly be arrested and prosecuted for their involvement with the two-month long protest. Hong Kong Police have not responded to requests for comment.","Girl, 14, will not be taken into care after she was arrested for drawing on wall with chalk .

"(CNN)Building and programing a robot from scratch may sound like an impossible task to most primary school students, but one man is changing that mind-set for a generation of Ugandans. By showing students as young as six how robots can solve real-world problems, Fundi Bots founder Solomon King Benge wants young people to develop a creative skill set they can apply to solve issues specific to their lives. ""We have a team in northern Uganda building an automated farming program,"" explains 32 year-old King Benge. ""The project includes an irrigation system for crops and also a temperature monitoring solution to make sure... cow feed doesn't overheat and go bad. The students are also working on an automatic seed dispenser to feed pigs."" Ugandan learning . In a country where over 90% of primary school-aged children are enrolled in classes, according to World Bank data, Fundi Bots first focuses on extracurricular time slots in schools. As well as presentations and video-based learning, Fundi Bots also offers hands-on robotics training and helps keen students form weekly Robotics Clubs. The initiative has taken off in 15 schools spread across the capital, Kampala, and Gulu in the north where experienced mentors visit once or twice a month to offer ideas and encouragement. But tinkering with robotic parts and coming up with new ideas carries on after school too. During holiday camps (which can last two weeks) students are taught robotic concepts and then given time to implement that learning by building a robot by the end of the camp. Central to the Fundi Bots philosophy is that building robots does not require a fortune. Students are encouraged to use recycled materials or components like laser pointers and microphones that were never originally designed to be a robotic building-block. ""One group of 13 and 14-year-olds is creating a small remote controlled vehicle with a temperature reader on the front that could be used in fire-risk areas,"" King Benge explains. ""Their idea uses a wireless transmitter which sends data back in real-time, but they managed to keep costs quite low at around $130, by using locally sourced materials like wheels from toy cars."" While the physical components may not command high prices, the skills students gain in the process could prove lucrative. According to euRobotics AISBL, the global market for robotics amounted to $25.8 billion in June 2014 and is expected to grow to more than $70 billion by 2020. Pan-African Robots . While the Fundi Bots' program is showing initial signs of having an impact in Uganda, King Benge says that's just the start. ""Fundi Bots is based in Uganda, but our five year mandate is to build a presence in five African countries by the end of 2020,"" explains King Benge. ""The most promising country at the moment is Rwanda because the government is very forward thinking and very keen to develop as the ICT powerhouse in the region."" Fundi Bots, which held a workshop in Rwanda last October, might be the first robotics teaching program in Uganda, but it is not the only one of its kind in Africa. The African Robotics Network (AFRON) was established in Ghana in April 2012 to improve education around robotics. One way the group has worked on this goal is by organizing the week-long Ashesi Robotics Experience. It was during this set of workshops that a participant developed the Lollybot  - a basic ""mini-explorer"" robot which can navigate obstacles and learn about its surroundings. The robot, which uses Chupa Chups lollipops in the design, can be built from scratch for a total cost of just $8.96. ""The enthusiasm of the kids is incredible,"" says Ayorkor Korsah, Assistant Computer Science Professor at Ashesi University College and co-founder of the African Robotics Network. ""Recognizing that a robot can be made from familiar items like a computer mouse, or game controller really demystifies robotics and electronics for them."" Robots are also playing a more prominent role in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Eight feet tall robotic traffic wardens designed and built by a team of local engineers, have been recording and controlling traffic 24 hours a day for just less than a year. As the Ugandan students learn new ways to build robots, King Benge says there's no limit to what could emerge from the workshops and retreats. ""When I see the students coming up with innovative ideas I really see minds are being changed. Students are being exposed to the creative process and I look forward to seeing them come up with bigger projects in five or 10 years time.""More from Marketplace AfricaRead this: Turning Ghana's farms into healthy businessesRead this: Africa's 10 most prosperous countries .","Fundi Bots is teaching Ugandan school children to build robots .

"Spanish police arrested two suspected terrorists with apparent links to an al Qaeda-affiliated group Tuesday but said they had no indication of an imminent attack. The Interior Ministry identified the suspects as Nou Mediouni, 23, from Algeria, who was arrested in the north-central city of Zaragoza, and Hassan El Jaaouani, 52, from Morocco, who was detained in the southeastern city of Murcia. Spanish police worked with their counterparts in France and Morocco to carry out the latest arrests, an Interior Ministry statement said. The two suspects have a ""profile"" that is similar to the two suspects in the Boston Marathon attacks, the statement said. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters that police consider them ""lone wolves,"" like the Boston suspects. However, the similarity is based only on how the two suspects in Spain were ""radicalized,"" by going to online forums and chat rooms, and also in the suspects' alleged interest in pulling from the Internet information on bomb-making, said an Interior Ministry spokesman, who by custom is not identified. The pair, who are from different countries, are not brothers and, unlike the two suspects in the Boston Marathon attacks, have no roots in the Caucasus region, he said. But Fernandez said one of the suspects recently praised the Boston attacks. A second Interior Ministry spokesman said that was the younger suspect, Mediouni. Both of the suspects in Spain are unemployed, the second Interior Ministry spokesman said. Mediouni, arrested in Zaragoza, studied computer sciences but had not worked professionally in that field, the ministry statement said. The two are suspected members of a radical cell close to the terrorist organization al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Interior Ministry said. The two men have been under surveillance as part of an operation lasting more than a year run in cooperation with France and Morocco, the Spanish Interior Ministry said. The Madrid train bombings in March 2004, which killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800, led to a sharp increase in Spain's fight against Islamic terrorism. The courts convicted 14 Islamic militants for their role in the bombings, along with four Spaniards convicted for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. Since then, authorities have told CNN that Spain has assigned hundreds of additional police officers to investigate Islamic terrorism and added dozens of Arabic translators, so authorities will be able to understand communications and threats. Around 400 suspected Islamic militants have been arrested in Spain since March 2004, although many have been released by judges for lack of evidence. Mali extremist contacts alleged . Mediouni was identified and recruited by Mali-based members of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb through his interest in radical Islamist Internet sites, the Interior Ministry statement alleges. He was given specific instructions for a trip to a jihadist camp in northern Mali led by the group, the Interior Ministry claims, but was unable to meet with AQIM leaders because of the heightened security presence in the area. Since January, France and nearby African nations have been supporting Malian forces in their efforts to push back Islamist extremists who carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year. El Jaaouani is also alleged to have established contact with AQIM leaders in Mali and to be responsible for recruiting radicals in Spain. One of the people he contacted was directly involved with the kidnapping and murder of two French citizens in Niger in January 2011, the Spanish Interior Ministry said. The two suspects' homes were being searched by police, the statement added. They are due to be arraigned Thursday at the National Court in Madrid, which handles terrorism cases, a court spokeswoman said. The arrests in Spain come days before the Madrid Marathon on Sunday. About 26,000 runners are expected to take part in a marathon, half-marathon and 10-kilometer race, to be run at the same time. Security has been increased in light of the attacks in Boston, authorities said. READ MORE: Men accused of planning al Qaeda-supported attack in Canada . READ MORE: Should we still fear al Qaeda?

"(CNN) -- Spain's answer to Susan Boyle took to the stage in a national talent show and produced a jaw-dropping display of athletic ability to win the competition. The show-stopper was 75-year-old British grandmother Paddy Jones who reportedly returned to dancing just five years ago after the death of her husband. Jones, who is originally from Stourbridge in the West Midlands, England, appeared on stage in front of a studio audience with a partner 40 years her junior. The unlikely partners proceeded to perform a high-energy sequence of gravity-defying lifts, spins and flips. Clips of Jones' performance on ""Tu Si Que Vales,"" the Spanish equivalent of ""Britain's Got Talent,"" are attracting hits on video-sharing site YouTube and comments including ""wonderful,"" ""excellent"" and ""incredible woman!!"" Watch Jones' performance on ""Tu Si Que Vales"" on YouTube . Jones, whose real name is Sarah, told the local Stourbridge News that she was stunned by her newfound fame. ""It's crazy -- life has just turned upside down. We're absolutely over the moon. I never really expected it,"" she said. ""Since then we've been recognized everywhere. I was in the doctor's and people were coming up to me, and at the supermarket and even when I went to fill up with petrol. It's absolutely wonderful."" The Stourbridge News reported that Jones was a professional dancer in her youth. She now lives in Gandia, near Valencia in Spain and is said to have taken up salsa dancing five years ago to keep herself entertained. On the program, Jones is seen stepping onto the stage in impressively high heels, arm-in-arm with the local dance school instructor, Nico. He explains to the clearly incredulous judges that they will be performing ""salsa acrobatica."" Seconds into the routine, he hoists Jones onto his shoulders, from where she executes a proficient backflip. The cameras cut away to show one judge's astonished expression while the audience cheers. From there, the routine becomes even more physical and ends when Nico flips Jones upside down and over his shoulder, drawing a standing ovation from the judges and the crowd. Jones' triumphant confounding of expectations echoes that of ""Britain's Got Talent"" winner Susan Boyle who soared to international stardom with her unexpectedly tuneful rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Last week Boyle, who is known by her fanbase as SuBo, set a new record in the U.S. for the most albums sold by any artist in a single week, with the largest ever sales debut for a female artist. Boyle's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" album hit the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart with 701,000 copies sold in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Before finding fame, the unmarried 48-year-old lived in a modest home in a small town in Scotland with her pet cat.","British grandmother stuns talent show with athletic salsa performance .

"(CNN)Political unrest has plagued Yemen for years, and the entire Mideast has been in turmoil for decades, particularly since 2011's Arab Spring uprising. But on Tuesday, the situation in Yemen apparently became much more dire, as the country's minister of information said Shiite Houthi rebels had taken over the nation's presidential palace. Amid reports of renewed fighting in Yemen, Nadia Sakkaf told CNN that the residence of Yemen's Prime Minister was under attack. Sakkaf called the situation ""the completion of a coup,"" adding that President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi ""has no control."" Yemen, the poorest country in the region, is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, which most recently claimed responsibility for the massacre of journalists at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris. It's one of the world's biggest exporters of terrorism. AQAP is benefiting hugely from the current conflict in Yemen. Gunfire could be heard throughout the capital, Sanaa, on Tuesday, as CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported that security there was tenuous. On Monday night, unknown assailants fired shots at a U.S. Embassy vehicle in the city, the embassy said. It has said it's prepared to evacuate but no orders have been given. Here are seven things you need to know about what's happening in Yemen and why it matters. Yemen is a country of about 26 million people on the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. It borders Saudi Arabia and Oman, and is near important Red Sea shipping lanes. Yemen is a young nation, having been created in 1990 when North and South Yemen united. The north and south started a civil war within a few years, with the north prevailing after thousands died. Yemen is very poor because of declining oil resources. Because terrorists in Yemen have reached into the United States. Remember Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the ""underwear bomber"" who tried to blow up an American jetliner over Detroit in 2009? He took his marching orders from AQAP. The Boston Marathon bombing suspects and Maj. Nidal Hasan, the American soldier who gunned down 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, apparently were inspired by an American-born cleric in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki. An American drone killed him in 2011. Many would-be jihadis from the West are recruited into al Qaeda through a slick English-language online magazine, Inspire, that's run out of Yemen. U.S. officials consider AQAP the most dangerous branch of al Qaeda, according to CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. It's actually a three-way battle among the government, the Houthis and AQAP. The Houthis, a rebel group composed of Shiite Muslims, feel marginalized in the majority Sunni country. In September, Houthis seized government buildings in Sanaa and its airport. They demanded greater political influence. President Hadi introduced a new constitution without the Houthis' approval, and the rebels abducted Yemen's presidential chief of staff to show their disapproval. In response, the government closed roads as a security measure. That set off renewed fighting. Most of the recent fighting has been for control of the presidential complex. On Monday, the government and the Houthis announced another ceasefire. Hadi has battled AQAP since taking office in 2012, and the United States has invested heavily in this campaign. He reorganized Yemen's military, and for a while put AQAP on the defensive. But the conflict with the Houthis diverted resources that could be used against AQAP. AQAP is working to keep things unstable, but it doesn't look like the group has been involved in the Sanaa fighting so far. In October, AQAP staged a suicide bombing against a Houthi rally that killed 50 people. It also released a video showing members executing 14 Houthis. At the same time, it has stepped up attacks against police and the army. No way. In fact, they're adversaries in the long-running Sunni-Shiite conflict. Differences between the two main branches of Islam developed over the centuries. Shiite Muslims believed the Prophet Mohammed's cousin should have been the successor after his death in in A.D. 632, while Sunnis believe a successor should have been elected. Only 10% of the world's Muslim population is Shiite. They're named after the late cleric Hussein Badreddin al-Houth (or Hussein Badr Eddine al-Houthi), who was killed during a 2004 rebellion against the government in Saada, according to the U.S. State Department. Houthis are mostly militias and tribes that follow the Zaidi sect of Islam. Al Qaeda considers them Shiites. Some members of al Qaeda and even Western diplomats allege that Iran, one of the few Shiite Muslim nations, is bankrolling the Houthi rebellion in an effort to control Yemen's Red Sea coast on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The Houthis deny Iran is funding them. Hadi has said the Houthis are being trained and advised by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia. Some presidential officials are worried about actions by republican guards, former regime officials who are still loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, the ex-President who was kicked out in 2012 during the Arab Spring. Chaos is good for terrorists. The weaker the government, the easier it will be for al Qaeda to bring in people and train them for terrorism. The chaos hampers Western efforts to hunt down al Qaeda, and hampers Western efforts to even be in the country. CNN's Raja Razek contributed to this report.","Yemen presidential palace overrun; president ""has no control,"" government official says .

In Vermont, there could be between 3 and 7 inches of snow and 10 inches in the state's highest elevations. Ice storms hit parts of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania over the weekend,  prompting the mayor of Danbury, Connecticut, to begin the hashtag #Icezilla. ""Still slippery, but calls are slowing down in our 911 center. #Danbury #Icezilla,"" Mayor Mark Boughton tweeted. The Hartford Courant reported that the ice contributed to more than 216 car accidents on Sunday, including a fatal crash in New Haven. The New York Fire Department fielded some 3,700 emergency calls, CNN affiliate WABC reported Monday, and the department took the unusual step of calling in help from neighboring agencies. As Monday wears on -- there's some good news for the Northeast -- the ice will start melting as temperatures creep upward. A messy mix of ice and rain left bridges, overpasses and interstates very slick Sunday. Two people died in accidents related to black ice in the Philadelphia area, state police said. In one of the accidents, one person was killed after getting out of a car and being hit by an oncoming vehicle, authorities said. The person got out of the car after crashing into at least 20 vehicles piled up on Interstate 76. An additional two people were killed in a multicar crash in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, CNN affiliate KYW reported. The three cars rammed into a tractor-trailer and got stuck underneath, it said. At least one person has died in Harford County, Maryland, state police spokesman Greg Shipley said. There were dozens of crashes Sunday throughout central and northern Maryland. Most occurred in Howard, Baltimore, Harford and Cecil counties.","Storm warning for upstate Vermont, parts of New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts .

"U.S. authorities are not required to release any internal National Security Agency communications it had with Internet giant Google Inc. after a 2010 cyber attack in China, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. At issue was a Freedom of Information Act request from a private group over the suspected collaborative relationship between the public and private entities. The NSA said disclosure of any communications -- even with outside companies -- would threaten government information systems. The agency had given the Electronic Privacy Information Center a so-called ""Glomar"" response, in which the government refuses to confirm or deny the existence of any requested records. EPIC, a privacy and civil liberties group, made the FOIA submission weeks after the January 2010 cyberattack on Gmail accounts, primarily targeting Chinese human rights activists. Google quickly changed its server encryption protocols following the digital attacks, and a top company official publicly stated its engineers were ""also working with the relevant U.S. authorities."" A federal judge eventually sided with the NSA and Google, and the three-judge federal panel has now affirmed. ""The existence of a relationship or communications between the NSA and any private company certainly constitutes an 'activity' of the agency subject to protection"" from public disclosure, said Judge Janice Rogers Brown. ""Moreover, if private entities knew that any of their attempts to reach out to NSA could be made public through a FOIA request, they might hesitate or decline to contact the agency, thereby hindering its Information Assurance mission."" Brown was backed by Judges Brett Kavanaugh and Douglas Ginsburg, all named to the bench by Republican presidents. The court noted past precedent giving the government leeway in deciding which information it wishes to share with the public. ""In reviewing an agency's Glomar response, this court exercises caution when the information requested implicates national security, a uniquely executive purview,"" said Brown. ""NSA need not make a specific showing of potential harm to national security in order to justify withholding information."" The Glomar precedent refers to a 1970s incident, where the CIA refused to discuss a ship under its control, allegedly used to secretly salvage a Soviet submarine which had sunk. EPIC now has the option of asking the Supreme Court to hear its free-speech appeal. The group says despite Friday's legal setback, it has several other similar, pending lawsuits against the agency. Lawyers from EPIC had argued the collaboration between Google and the federal agency -- which conducts global electronic surveillance -- was widely reported in the national media. The private group said the agency thus had a responsibility to locate records that could be disclosed."" The military's top officer warned last year of the ""substantial"" and complex threat to the U.S. from foreign cyberattack. ""We've got to come to a place where those threats are diminished, if not eliminated,"" then-Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said in January 2011. ""I would never go in, certainly in any area of warfare, into details on threats except to say they are substantial. We are focused on them."" Mullen, who retired last fall, said that cyberspace is a lawless terrain. ""The threat from China is significant,"" Mullen said. ""There are other threats out there that we see routinely. ... It is an enormously complex and critical area that all of us need to understand a lot better and do a lot more about."" The case is EPIC v. NSA (11-5233).","Federal appeals court affirms protection of communications between Google and NSA .

"Two thirds of the world population does not have Internet access. Facebook already has more than a billion users on its service, but before it can sign up the rest of world it needs to get them online. The social media company announced a new step in its ambitious plan to bring affordable, basic Internet access to ""every person in the world."" Facebook's new Connectivity Lab will research and test experimental technology including drones, satellites and lasers to spread the reach of the Internet to isolated locations that currently do not have Internet. ""We've been working on ways to beam Internet to people from the sky,"" said CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a post announcing the new effort. Last year, Facebook announced Internet.org, a coalition of major tech companies working together to lower barriers to Internet access using more traditional methods, such as making it cheaper to get Internet on cell phones. Those efforts have been responsible for getting 3 million more people online, according to Zuckerberg. This new initiative focuses on experimenting with new technology. The group is working with drones that can stay in the air for months at a time, bringing Internet connections to suburban areas. In more rural spots, satellites will be tested as a way to beam connections to the people on the ground. The group will attempt to make speedier long distance connections using invisible infrared laser beams. The developers who keep redesigning your Facebook news feed will not be dabbling in satellites and drones. Facebook has brought on aerospace experts from NASA and the team who built the Zephyr solar-powered drone. Internet access is a cause major technology companies can easily get behind. It's a smart business investment that doubles as a charitable cause. Google announced plans to tackle the issue last summer with its own ambitious Project Loon. Instead of drones, the company is testing giant balloons that travel in the earth's stratosphere for 100 days at a time. Using specialized antennas, the balloons will deliver Internet at 3G speeds. Both companies frame their plans to bring the Internet to the entire world as altruistic, not as a land grab. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates dismissed some of these efforts in an interview with Bloomberg in 2013, saying ""when a kid gets diarrhea, no, there's no website that relieves that."" In many of the world's most remote areas, poverty is a more pressing concern than Internet connectivity. People cannot afford electricity or clean water, let alone phones. However, humanitarian organizations have been pushing for more access in these remote areas to improve the efficiency of aid work. For example, it would make it easier to set up remote health care stations in situations where the nearest doctors or hospitals are hours or days away. In countries where the Internet is already more widespread, unfettered access allows for freedom of speech and expression. So much so that the United Nations declared access to the Internet a basic human right in 2011. Governments can still censor or filter access to control what information is disseminated, as the Turkish government is doing with its recent attempts to block Twitter and YouTube. For now, the Connectivity Lab is focusing on the technical challenges of delivering the Internet to geographically tricky spots. Eventually, low cost Internet and cell phone use could spread to the populations in these areas and when it does, maybe they'll sign up for Facebook.","Facebook is working on new technology to get the entire world's population online .

"(CNN)When racial conflict flared in Ferguson, Missouri, this summer it brought back terrible memories of what happened nearly 50 years ago, in the summer of 1965. Then, with a Democratic administration riding high on a string of major legislative victories, including landmark civil rights and voting rights legislation, six days of horrendous rioting broke out in Watts, Los Angeles following community frustration with police brutality. As the nation celebrates the birthday of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., it is a good time to look back at some of his unfulfilled agenda from the late 1960s, when he had turned his attention to issues directly related to the riots, such as fair housing, unemployment and the infrastructure of the cities. The rioting in Watts devastated the community. The conflict began on August 11 following a traffic stop in the African-American neighborhood. The police pulled over the car of 21-year-old Marquette Frye and his brother in the early evening. The police believed that Frye was intoxicated. Frye's mother arrived on the scene and started to yell at the police to leave her son alone. In Watts, many community residents didn't trust the police. Charges of police brutality had been commonplace for decades. When the policeman arrested the brother and their mother, an angry crowd started to throw bottles and rocks at the police. Rumors circulated that the police had hit a pregnant woman. The rioting quickly spread through a 25-block area. One five-year-old boy was killed by sniper fire. President Lyndon Johnson, who had been riding high from a wave of legislative victories, couldn't believe what he was hearing was taking place in Watts. His response shifted from anger to frustration to a determination to fix the problem. At times, Johnson showed his worst side by privately castigating the African Americans as irresponsible children who didn't appreciate what he had done for them and who were ruining everything that he had helped to achieve. During a conversation with I.W. Abel, the new president of the Steelworkers Union, on August 14, Johnson said they had ""hell in Los Angeles"" and that African Americans needed to learn they had ""obligations as well as rights. We fought like a devil to get them their rights and we're going to continue to. And we want them to be responsible now."" The riots continued for six days with 34 people killed and hundreds injured. The National Guard helped restore order. More than 3,000 people were arrested. The buildings and businesses in the area were devastated. Americans watched in shock. Overseas, the Soviet Union blasted out images of the rioting to use as propaganda in an effort to show that racial violence was commonplace in this allegedly ""democratic"" country. As Johnson's anger simmered when the riots cooled down, he spoke much more about the deeper economic problems that he believed were fueling the anger in communities like Watts. Johnson had been moved by a report from Patrick Moynihan that traced the breakdown of the African American family after years of discrimination and hardship. On August 18, Johnson told former CIA Director John McCone that these ""groups they got really absolutely nothing to live for. Forty percent of them are unemployed. These youngsters, they live with rats and they've got no place to sleep . . . broken homes and illegitimate families and all the narcotics are circulating around them.... And we've isolated them, and they're all in one area, when they move in why we move out."" The riots caused tension with civil rights leaders, who were eager for Johnson to deal more aggressively with issues like police brutality and economic despair.  On August 20, Johnson told Martin Luther King that he was telling everyone the government needed to ""correct these conditions,"" like housing and unemployment. King was frustrated. He complained to Johnson that the mayor of Los Angeles was ""absolutely insensitive to the problems and to the needs to really cure the situation."" King said the mayor and police leaders were unwilling to make any concessions. King feared that if there was more rioting there would be violent retaliation from white people. ""So that I'm fearful that if something isn't done to give a new sense of hope to the people in that area -- and they are poverty stricken -- that a full-scale race war can develop here...."" King wanted Johnson to propose a robust poverty program for the area. Johnson said he fully supported such a strategy. The president said that they needed to get young African Americans jobs and homes. He said that ""I've spent the biggest part of my life the last four years on civil rights bills, but it doesn't, all of it comes to naught if you have a situation like war in the world or a situation in Los Angeles."" Johnson said that ""there's no use giving lectures on the law as long as you've got rats eating on people's children and unemployed and no roof over their head and no job to go to and maybe with a dope needle in one hand and the cancer in the other!"" But, the president went on to say, there wasn't much political support for doing anything substantial. Indeed, the Senate was already giving him a tough time on simply providing funding for his War on Poverty. ""I'm having hell up here with this Congress,"" Johnson said. In the end, the riots did not result in any major changes in policy. The only major outcome following two more riots in 1967 (in Detroit and Newark) would be an independent commission, chaired by former Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner, that investigated the causes of the rioting. The Kerner Commission issued its landmark report in 1968, concluding: ""Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal."" But Congress never provided any substantial boost in funds to deal with these sorts of problems. The riots came right as Johnson's political strength in Congress started to diminish. He didn't believe he could ask for money to do something about it. Ever since then, the situation in too many inner-city areas has remained grim even as neighborhoods around them boom with gentrification. Good jobs continued to be elusive. Policing remains a problem as does the narcotics trade. Families continue to suffer and educational opportunities have vanished. The nation has never dealt with the problems that afflicted Watts. The riots took place just as Johnson's political power was staring to ebb and the white backlash against more racial reform was setting in. The inability to save the inner cities was one of the great failures of liberal reform in the past century, one that continues to haunt the nation. ​ .","Deadly riots erupted in an L.A. neighborhood in 1965, just as LBJ's power was waning .

"Twenty-five years ago on March 24, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into Bligh Reef and spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into the cold, clear waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound -- one of the ""last best places"" on Earth. The oil charged through Prince William Sound and out into the Gulf of Alaska, damaging more than 1,300 miles of some of the most remote, wild shoreline in this country. This happened 25 years ago, so we might note the anniversary as we do any other historical event. That, however, would imply that the oil spill is over. It's not, and likely never will be. The sound's coastal ecosystem is permanently damaged. Thousands of gallons of Exxon Valdez oil still pollute the beaches; this oil is still toxic and still hurting the ecosystem near the shore. The government considers, as of 2010, only 13 of the 32 monitored wildlife populations, habitats and resource services that were injured in the spill as fully ""recovered"" or ""very likely recovered."" Some are still listed today as ""not recovering."" This includes a pod of orcas, which lost 15 of its 22 members after the spill, and has not produced a calf since. Given only one older female is left, scientists appear certain that this unique pod of orcas will go extinct -- it's just a matter of time. The government conclusion is that ""there appears to be no hope for recovery."" The ""not recovering"" list also includes Pacific herring, one of the sound's keystone species. Once the source of a vibrant commercial fishery, herring declined so precipitously that a fishery closed, and has not reopened. Eight inches long, herring once swam in schools of a million or more, a sudden flash of their silver undersides confusing predators. In April, their spawning turned the bays and lagoons milky white. More than 40 species -- bald eagles, brown bears, seals, humpback whales, tufted puffins, murres -- depend on these small fish. Those of us who knew the sound before the spill, the ""bright and spacious wonderland"" described a century ago by John Muir's expedition, and who spend time in the magnificent coastal wilderness that remains, chafe at the idea of passing this 25th anniversary off as merely a historical event, of simply noting the date and then returning to business as usual. Persistent oil poisoning, and a cascade of ecological effects, continue. There's not much we can do now for Prince William Sound, short of protecting it from more harm. But we can keep from repeating our mistakes elsewhere. This is, after all, why we pay attention to history. Unfortunately, we still haven't learned the biggest lesson of all from the Exxon Valdez oil spill: The only real solution is to stop using so much oil. Whether it's Prince William Sound or the Gulf of Mexico, seldom is more than 10% of the spilled oil recovered. This will be especially true in Arctic waters. And regardless of how safe we make oil drilling, tankers, or pipelines, we'll never reduce spill risk to zero. But the larger reason to reduce our dependence on oil is this: Even if we as a society don't care about oil spills destroying natural environments, we've got to care -- eventually we will all care -- about how burning this oil is destroying our environment through climate change. As the south coast of Alaska struggles to recover from one spill a quarter of a century later, Alaska's polar bears are drowning from lack of Arctic sea ice. It's a sad irony that the push for Arctic oil drilling has reached an all-time high. Right now, as the polar bears' ice shrinks, we are trying  at a fever pitch to pull the very substance out of their ocean home that, when burned, will destroy their ocean home. No wonder one of OPEC's founders, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso, once called oil ""el excremento del diablo,"" or the devil's excrement. The best use of this anniversary is to do better, both by ourselves and the rest of the animal world with whom we share our planet. Halting oil drilling in the Arctic would be a clear first step toward doing better. It's time for President Obama to take steps away from the ""all of the above"" energy policy and move us forward on a path to a clean energy future.","25 years ago, Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound .

"Audio recordings released on Monday reveal confusion between air traffic controllers and the veteran crew of a Southwest Airlines jet after they landed at the wrong airport in Missouri in January. ""I assume I'm not at your airport,"" one of the pilots radioed to controllers at Branson Airport, the Boeing 737's intended destination. ""4013, um, have you landed?"" comes the response, according to the recordings released by the Federal Aviation Administration. ""Yea,"" says the pilot, after a brief pause. Then the controller calls to another air traffic facility for the area to inquire about the plane, and there is this exchange: . ""Did you watch Southwest land?"" ""Yea, why?"" ""Did you see it come here? They're saying it landed at the wrong airport."" ""Are you kidding?"" ""Yea,  no, I'm not."" The plane from Chicago actually landed several miles away at a municipal airport in Taney County, which doesn't have a control tower. And that wasn't all. The Taney County airport's runway is 3,738 feet, about half the length of the Branson runway, which is 7,140 feet. That forced pilots to act fast and brake hard when the aircraft with 129 passengers and crew touched down. No one was injured and the jet took off the next day. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. The pilots remain on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation, Southwest said in a statement.","FAA releases audio recording of air controllers and Southwest crew after landing .

"When he was on the baseball field, Ryan Freel was unafraid to fling his body, and his head, into plays -- diving after balls and crashing into outfield walls. That fearlessness earned the undersized Freel a spot in the big leagues, as well as a raft of concussions. Now, nearly a year after his death, Freel has the distinction of being the first Major League Baseball player to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), according to researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine. ""The real important issue is that he hit his head multiple times -- small hits, big hits, in baseball and outside of baseball,"" said Robert Stern, co-founder of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at BU. ""When it comes to the development of CTE, our current sense is that it requires repetitive brain trauma and not just a couple of big concussions."" Freel committed suicide last December at the age of 36. Testing of his brain tissue after death -- the only way to definitively diagnose CTE -- found that he had Stage 2 CTE, which is associated with erratic behavior and memory loss.  Stage 4, the worst possible expression of the disease, is associated with full-blown dementia, aggression and paranoia. The brain tissue of people found to have CTE displays an abnormal build-up of tau -- a protein that, when it spills out of cells, can choke off, or disable, neural pathways controlling things like memory, judgment and fear. Freel's stepfather Clark Vargas said on Sunday that the new diagnosis confirmed what he suspected already. ""It provides some solace that there is a reason now for Ryan having done what he did,"" Vargas said. ""Knowing that he's been suffering for 11 years and that CTE is a progressive disease, it gives explanation (for) some of the irrational things that he may have done. You know, he had a reason."" The disease tends to be associated with bruising sports like football and hockey, where repetitive brain trauma is part of the game. But Freel's case suggests that professional baseball, a somewhat punishing sport in its own right, may have a growing concussion problem. ""We count everything else. We count the at-bats. We count the .300 hitter. We count the number of pitches and the pitcher cannot go more than a certain number of pitches. Why not count the number of concussions and pay special attention to this like everything else?"" his stepfather said. This season, 18 baseball players were placed on the disabled list after concussions -- 10 of them were catchers.  In 2012, 13 players were placed on the DL after a concussion, and in 2011, the number was 11, according to MLB data. ""I think people don't realize that baseball players get hurt as much as they do,"" said Freel's mother, Norma Vargas. ""Baseball is just as dangerous"" as other sports and, she added, affords players less protection. ""It's just a helmet and that's it."" And players wear the helmet only when batting. Report: Former NFL player's body exhumed for brain study . ""I cringe when I see two guys going after the same ball,"" said Stern, a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at BU's School of Medicine.  ""Is baseball as significant a concussion sport compared to others? No. Is it a concussion sport? Yes."" In a statement issued Sunday evening, Major League Baseball said it was working with experts ""to remain proactive on concussions and head injuries."" ""Major League Baseball's thoughts remain with Ryan Freel's family, friends and all those he touched throughout his life,"" the league said. ""Ryan played baseball with love and passion and made a lasting impression on and off the field. We recently met in person with Ryan's mother and stepfather and expressed to them our feelings about Ryan and discussed MLB's continued efforts to provide a safe environment for our players."" In response to increasing concussion diagnoses, the sport is instituting educational programs and rules changes, like a ban on home plate collisions beginning as early as 2014. ""Ryan's life and death ought to mean something, and because of him, we can institute changes how baseball is played,"" Clark Vargas said. ""It's going to take some time to do it in the major leagues, but certainly we can do something about it next year ... about the kids playing Pop Warner and Little League."" Freel's mother is unsure whether those types of changes, had they happened sooner, might have altered her son's fate. ""It could have,"" said Norma Vargas.  ""I think it would have been a good idea if they would have (educated players)."" However, she said, ""I don't think that would have changed his style of play."" Freel's style was relentless and fierce. During his eight-year career with five MLB clubs, Freel estimated that he had 10 concussions. Family members say it was likely higher than that. His concussion history started young.  He was only 2 years old when he ran into the side of a moving car.  Age 4 marked the first time that he lost consciousness after a concussion, when he injured himself jumping from a bed. He lived life at ""one speed, and that was a fast speed,"" said his mother. Suspicions that he could have CTE began percolating among family and friends after Freel killed himself a year ago. But he had had problems for a long time before he died. Former NFL player wants brain studied . For several years, he struggled with depression, and drug and alcohol abuse.  And only months before his death, he and his wife of 11 years divorced. These types of problems -- which are echoed in other CTE cases -- raise questions about how big a role the disease plays in suicides among players, and how things like pre-existing mental health problems, or post-career adjustment issues, influence the cause of death. Among the football players who showed signs of the disease and took their own lives are former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters, who shot himself in 2006; Terry Long, a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze; and Junior Seau, the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43. Former NFL players Dave Duerson, Shane Dronett and Ray Easterling also committed suicide and were later diagnosed with CTE. ""If you hit your head a lot, it may increase your risk for this disease,"" said Stern.  ""Whether or not the disease was the cause of or accentuated the depression and substance abuse and impulse problems (Freel had), we don't know. ""But he required more attention and treatment than he got."" Because of limited data, and a study population that is skewed toward people exposed to repetitive brain trauma, scientists --  including BU researchers -- caution against over-interpreting case studies like Freel's. ""We can learn a lot about diseases by studying these higher-risk populations,"" said Dr. J. Clay Goodman, professor of pathology, immunology and neurology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.  ""Until we know much more about CTE, however, it is not possible to generalize about the risk of development even in elite athletes, much less more casual athletes or the population at large."" Freel's family, including his ex-wife, had said that a CTE diagnosis would tie up loose ends emotionally -- and give them much-needed closure. Norma Vargas says a big concern for her is how the CTE diagnosis will affect the narrative of Freel's life for his three young daughters. ""He's gone no matter what,"" she said.  ""But I want that closure for his daughters."" She wants them to know that he didn't kill himself ""because he didn't love them or he did it because he was mad at the world. ""It was not that way, he was killed (by the disease).""

"Washington (CNN)Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said in an interview with CNN Wednesday that if the Supreme Court eventually rules that same-sex marriage is constitutional, Americans would have to abide by that ruling. ""I wouldn't agree with their ruling, but that would be the law of the land that we would have to follow until it's somehow reversed — either by a future Supreme Court, or a U.S. constitutional amendment, which I don't think is realistic or foreseeable,"" he said. He said he expects the question ""is ultimately going to find its way to the U.S. Supreme court,"" noting that many federal courts have recently issued rulings overturning state bans on gay marriage. Indeed, many court watchers expect the Supreme Court to take up a case on that very issue this month, and potentially deliver a ruling this Spring. That prospect, and the end of Florida's same-sex marriage ban this week, have brought the issue back into the national spotlight and sparked a fresh debate within the Republican Party over gay marriage, which the party's social conservative base staunchly opposes. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is preparing for a potential run for president, offered a careful statement respecting the decision for the Florida development. During a Tuesday interview with CNN in the Capitol, Rubio declined to evaluate Bush's comments because he said he hadn't seen them. But the senator, who is contemplating a presidential run of his own, said he would respect federal courts' decisions to overturn gay marriage bans. ""My position on [gay marriage] is pretty well-known. I mean, I believe that the institution of marriage is defined as the union of one man and one woman. I understand that voters in some states have changed that, and I respect it,"" he said. ""And, you know, we have a court system that's beginning to weigh in — and whatever the law is, we're going to abide by it and respect it."" But his Tuesday comments came in contrast to remarks he made in a speech at Catholic University in July defending state legislatures' and voters' rights to oppose gay marriage without judicial interference. ""Americans like myself who support keeping the traditional definition of marriage also have a right to work to keep traditional definition of marriage in our laws without seeing them overturned by a judge,"" he said, according to Politico. The Florida senator clarified during his Wednesday phone conversation that he felt his remarks did not constitute a shift from his July speech — that while he felt the court was mistaken, the state's officials had no option but to abide by it. ""I think [the court's decision] is wrong, both on legal principles, and I also think it's the wrong way to"" reverse Florida's gay marriage ban, which was approved by voters in 2008. He said the proper way to overturn a gay marriage ban is to offer an opposing ballot measure for the state's voters to again consider. But he added: ""I don't think [Florida's] clerks have a choice, at this stage, given that the ruling is there unless there's a stay,"" to follow the court's decision and issue marriage licenses. Rubio said if ultimately the Supreme Court issued a ruling protecting gay marriage as constitutional, opponents of gay marriage would be ""in the same boat as opponents of Roe v. Wade,"" the SCOTUS decision that established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. The controversy surrounding the issue underscores the tension inherent in the Republican Party's efforts to expand outreach beyond the GOP's traditional base of social conservatives, as the nation as a whole moves towards widespread acceptance of gay marriage and more   state legislatures overturn gay marriage bans. It's likely to become a hot-button issue in the GOP presidential primary as contenders jockey to differentiate themselves in what's expected to be a wide-open field. Bush's recent announcement that he's ""actively exploring"" a bid is expected to dissuade some from entering the race, and his launch this week of a leadership PAC and super PAC heightened speculation over his bid. Many expect that if Bush runs, Rubio, who shares much of Bush's political circle in Florida, won't — but the senator said Tuesday it won't impact his decision. ""There'll be multiple people running for president. They're all going to build organizations and raise money,"" he said, noting that if Bush runs he'll be a ""very formidable candidate."" But he added: ""I think once someone makes a decision and that's what they want to do to serve our country, you do that irrespective of who else might be in the race."" ""No one's decision would have a bearing on whether I decide whether that's where I want to serve or not — not just his,"" Rubio continued. Rubio has the unusual challenge of deciding whether to run for reelection to the Senate or for president in 2016. If he does decide to launch a presidential bid, he'll likely face stiff competition from a number of his colleagues in the Senate, including Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, both of whom have made little secret of their interest in the race. But Cruz, passing Rubio on his way to the Capitol, gave Rubio a brotherly pat on the back and joked to a reporter, ""Whatever he says,"" before rushing off, as Rubio laughed. Rubio later said his relationship with Cruz was ""good."" ""I hopefully get along with all my colleagues. We don't all agree on everything, especially with my Democratic colleagues on some key issues, but hopefully we get along with everyone,"" he said.","Marco Rubio said Americans should ""abide"" by a Supreme Court decision if it rules gay marriage is constitutional .
Local officials have no choice but to abide by federal courts' decisions to overrule gay marriage bans, he added .
Rubio said Jeb Bush's decision on 2016 won't dissuade him from running ."
"Florida State University quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston was cited for allegedly taking seafood from a Tallahassee grocery store without paying, the Leon County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Winston, a two-sport athlete, was suspended from FSU's baseball team on Wednesday. Winston, only the second freshman to win college football's most coveted award, allegedly walked into a Publix near the FSU campus Tuesday night, ordered about $32 worth of crab legs and crawfish, and walked out of the store without paying, sheriff's Maj. Michael Wood told reporters. After deputies contacted him about three hours later, Winston told them that he forgot to pay, Wood said. ""He was very cooperative,"" Wood said. ""Seemed fairly honest in the fact that he did not pay for the items, so it was not a huge mystery to solve."" Social media takes the story and runs with it . As part of the civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in the county -- Winston was not arrested but has been ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, Wood said. CNN's call to the university's athletic department was not immediately returned. ""I am confident he will complete his community service obligation and the situation will be resolved soon,"" FSU baseball coach Mike Martin said in a news release. The school's football coach, Jimbo Fisher, said, ""I fully support Coach Martin's decision and will also make sure that Jameis meets all obligations, which I know he will."" Wood said Winston ""most likely"" will have to pay Publix the $32, noting that restitution usually is part of the citation program. A Publix employee noticed Winston left without paying but waited a while to notify a deputy, thinking Winston might have gone outside to get a cart, Wood said. Wood said civil citations, as opposed to criminal charges, can be given in similar cases at deputies' discretion, and when the store and the suspect agree to terms. Publix and Winston agreed to this citation, Wood said. He said the sheriff's office has issued 32 civil citations ""for very similar crimes"" since December. Winston won the Heisman in December, a month after a Florida prosecutor announced no charges would be filed over a woman's allegation that Winston raped her in 2012. The prosecutor said authorities did not even have probable cause to arrest Winston in the case. The accuser alleged  Winston had raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar; Winston maintained that the sexual activity was consensual.","Heisman Trophy winner said he forgot to pay, police say .

"It was supposed to be a fun family outing to the movies, but Nair Rodriguez's 19-year-old daughter got under her skin. They fought, she said, and she slapped her daughter. Moments later, police arrived on a domestic dispute call at the Moore, Oklahoma, theater and did not confront Nair Rodriguez but rather her husband, Luis. They took him down, and after the encounter on February 15, he was dead. Cell phone video taken by Nair Rodriguez and released this week shows the final minutes of the takedown. Nair Rodriguez accuses officers of brutality. Police say they were following protocol and used no undue force, although three officers have been suspended with pay. Argument, upset . The mother-daughter spat upset the mother so badly that she bolted for the family car. Her husband, Luis, followed her to calm her down, family attorney Michael Brooks-Jimenez told reporters. That's when a group of police and theater security officers turned up, he said. There were three of them -- one working off-duty security at the theater and two active-duty officers already there to deal with two drunk patrons who'd passed out -- according to Moore police spokesman Sgt. Jeremy Lewis. (In addition, two Oklahoma state game wardens were working as off-duty security at the theater, state wildlife department spokesman Micah Holmes said.) As the two on-duty Moore officers were leaving, a person ran into the lobby and told them about some kind of domestic dispute outside, Lewis said. What happened next is disputed. Nair Rodriguez has said officers beat Luis Rodriguez, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. But Moore Police Chief Jerry Stillings calls the actions of his officers ""reasonable."" He would not go into much detail and said an investigation is under way. But he mentioned police used pepper spray, CNN affiliate KOCO reported. Luis Rodriguez ended up on the ground with five men pinning him down, and Nair Rodriguez pulled out a cell phone. Her fearful cries fill the recording. ""Luis! Luis!"" she calls out frantically. Her husband does not respond and does not appear to move. She calls to the officers to assure her that he is alright. ""Please somebody tell me that he is alive,"" she implores. ""He is not moving."" The officers appear calm. One tells her that he will talk to her once they are finished securing her husband. Then one walks over to the camera. He tells her that police have called in a medical unit to check on her husband. It wasn't him . The officer says police received a call about domestic violence before confronting her husband. It wasn't him, Nair Rodriguez tells him. ""I hit my daughter,"" she says. She wants to know why they have pinned down her husband. ""He refused to give his ID,"" the officer said. ""He got combative."" She notices blood on the officer.  ""Is he bleeding?"" she demands to know. ""I'm bleeding; that's me,"" the officer says. An ambulance can be seen in the background, and Luis Rodriguez is lifted onto a stretcher. The video ends shortly afterward. Cause of death . An autopsy may reveal more about why Luis Rodriguez died, and surveillance camera footage of the encounter in the movie theater parking lot may reveal what happened before his wife pulled out her cell phone camera. What police describe as normal procedure, lawyer Brooks-Jimenez describes as something brutal and possibly deadly -- pepper spray to the face and the weight of five men on top of him. CNN has reached out to Brooks-Jimenez for further comment. Lewis, from the Moore Police Department, said that three officers from his department who were involved in this incident have been suspended with pay while the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation reviews the incident. The two game wardens working security that day at the theater are continuing in their normal roles, according to Holmes of the state wildlife department. An autopsy on Luis Rodriguez was conducted on February 16, said Amy Elliott from Oklahoma's office of the chief medical examiner. His body was released four days later, but Rodriguez's full report won't be released until toxicology results come in, adds Elliott. Regardless of when that happens, the Rodriguez family may have to wait for closure. The Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation doesn't anticipate it will make any findings for months, according to spokeswoman Jessica Brown.","Spokesman: 3 Moore, Oklahoma, police officers are suspended with pay .

"Washington (CNN)Mitt Romney is eyeing another shot at the White House, but many Republicans, including those who admire and respect the party's most recent nominee, are wondering exactly what rationale he has for mounting another campaign in 2016. After all, in 2012 Romney lost all but one of the battleground states, trailed President Barack Obama 332-206 in electoral votes and Republicans panned his gaffe-prone campaign, chaotic convention and creaky tech operation. One working theory behind Romney 3.0 -- he thinks he got it right on the big issues that decided the last election and that voters have got buyers remorse. ""He is been proven right on so many of the issues, certainly domestic policy but (also) foreign policy. He almost looked prophetic there talking about Russia and talking about the war on terror,"" said Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. Aides have told reporters, including CNN's Gloria Borger, that Romney sees vindication in a world tipping into chaos and an economic recovery that left the middle class behind. At the GOP's winter meeting in San Diego on Friday, Romney said he has given ""serious consideration"" to a new run for the presidency, and his lacerating criticism of Obama suggested he believes he has earned his chance. So how do Romney's critiques and promises stand up as he yet again sets foot on the road to the White House? Foreign policy . Romney's best case for proving he was right may lie overseas. Not even the most committed Obama supporter could convincingly argue that the world is more stable than in 2012. It's only two years since the President brandished his own first term record of ending wars and killing Osama bin Laden to pound Romney as heir to a disastrous Republican foreign policy legacy. But assumptions underpinning Obama's statesmanship have started to fray. The rise of ISIS has raised questions about his decision to pull all troops out of Iraq and his reluctance to plunge into Syria's civil war. The standoff with Vladimir Putin has left his ""reset"" of relations with Russia looking naive. ""The results of the Hillary Clinton/Barack Obama foreign policy have been devastating,"" Romney said Friday, arguing that terrorist attacks in places like France and Nigeria proved ""the world is not safer."" As he watched crises consume Obama's foreign policy last year, Romney penned an 'I told you so' op-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled ""The Price of Failed Leadership."" ""Able leaders anticipate events, prepare for them, and act in time to shape them,"" Romney wrote. ""Some simply cannot envision the future and are thus unpleasantly surprised when it arrives. Some simply hope for the best. Others succumb to analysis paralysis, weighing trends and forecasts and choices beyond the time of opportunity."" Many Romney aides believe Russia proves his point. In the 2012 campaign, long before Putin annexed Crimea, the Republican said that Russia ""is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe."" Obama reacted with derision. ""The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War's been over for 20 years,"" he crowed in the third presidential debate. But time hasn't been kind to that zinger. While there is a debate whether Washington and Russia are really locked in a true Cold War, the Kremlin is doing a passable imitation of the Soviet Union. Russian aircraft are buzzing NATO planes in Europe and Russia stands accused of incursions in Ukraine. Moscow rewrote the borders of Europe by biting off Crimea and Putin warns the West wants to ""chain"" the Russian bear. While Romney predicted Moscow's belligerence, it's impossible to know whether tougher U.S. rhetoric would have changed Putin's calculations -- or antagonized him even more. And the administration argues that far from being the actions of a geopolitical foe, Putin's nationalism represents the thrashings of a weakened and desperate regime, that hardly poses a threat to the United States. And Obama might have adopted a tougher approach to Russia himself, had he not had to coax along European nations who were more reluctant than Washington to impose sanctions. Some of Romney's other 2012 foreign policy bets are yet to play out. He said that Iran's nuclear program is potentially the longest term threat to the United States. ""If we re-elect Barack Obama, Iran will have a nuclear weapon,"" he said in a Republican debate in 2011. So far, Iran has not gone nuclear. Obama says an interim deal has frozen Tehran's atomic advances and a final pact is being sought to stop the Islamic Republic short of the bomb. On Iraq, Romney hammered Obama in 2012 for not reaching a deal with Baghdad to leave a residual force behind after the war. Obama pounced, saying that meant his opponent wanted to keep U.S. troops in the country. Two years on the tables have turned and Obama has dispatched up to 3,000 troops to train Iraqi forces to take on ISIS -- though the administration insists that they will not be doing any fighting. Romney was also spot on when he warned the next few years would bring more ""chaos and tumult"" in the Middle East and that ""jihadists"" would continue to spread. But given the region's agonized history, it hardly takes a strategic genius to make such a prediction. The economy . Romney argued in 2012 that Obama's economic policy led to an anemic recovery from the worst recession in 70 years. He complained Obama broke his promise to cut the budget deficit in half and cited Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures projecting trillion dollar deficits for four years following 2014. While Romney was wrong about that, the latest CBO estimates do offer some support to his wider point. The nonpartisan body expects the deficit to only be around $500 billion in 2015 but sees a rising trend with trillion dollar deficits in 2022 through 2024 owing to higher health care costs and rising interest payments on federal debt. Romney's critique of the uneven economic recovery is also accurate. ""If you are elected president, we will continue to see a middle class squeeze with wages going down,"" he said in the first debate. He warned that if Obama got four more years in the White House, the national debt would approach $20 trillion. The figure is now $18 trillion. But Romney's claim the U.S. economy is on ""the road to Greece"" was always hyperbole. Romney also underestimated the pace of the recovery. ""You're going to get a repeat of the last four years,"" he said at the second presidential debate. He promised to get unemployment under 6% or lower in his first term. Consider that promise beaten -- by Obama. In December, the jobless number was 5.6%. Romney also promised to create 12 million jobs. In the first two years of Obama's second term the economy has pumped out 5.2 million jobs and could approach Romney's target before he leaves office. Last year was America's top year of job growth since 1999. But Republicans still call this the slowest economic recovery on record. Health care . Nowhere was the 2012 debate more intense or more dripping with spin and falsehoods than Obamacare -- on both sides. In almost every campaign rally, Romney claimed the average American family would see health costs rise by $2,500 annually because of the president's reforms. Statistics don't yet offer a full picture of Obamacare's impact on costs -- and the law has so upended the health care industry it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. But a Kaiser Foundation survey found that health care costs for family coverage in employer-sponsored plans rose 3% in 2014, well below Romney's figure. In the wider marketplace, the picture is complicated because some people who did not have health care before can now get it under Obamacare. Others have chosen better plans now available which may cost more. And some patients who bought Obamacare are now paying less for health care. Total spending for health care in the nation rose 3.6% in 2013, slower than the 4.1% rise the year before, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Growth in private health insurance premiums meanwhile grew at 2.8% in 2013 compared to 4.0% the year before. But Republicans point to extra costs -- claiming for instance that many people now face higher deductables. Romney was correct to say however that millions of Americans would lose their insurance policies under Obamacare, rejecting the president's health care whopper ""If you like your health plan you can keep your health plan."" But that's only half the story. While many people lost plans -- some because they did not reach quality thresholds set by Obamacare -- the White House says millions also signed up to new policies. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bear out that claim, finding that in the first half of 2014, 12.2% of Americans had no health insurance, compared to 17.3% the year before.","Romney feels vindication over 2012 campaign .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)It's a heart-pounding climb up a dark, piss-drenched stairwell. The greasy iron elevator that services the flaking 1920s apartment building seems to function only intermittently. A small group of German tourists is trapped inside. The bargain-priced apartment they've been renting maybe doesn't seem like such a good deal now. There's no word of when a maintenance engineer will show up or even if such a person exists. This is clearly no intellectual's ivory tower. And that's just the way Cuban author Pedro Juan Gutierrez likes it. ""Up here, I'm like a ghost. I've been a privileged witness to what has gone on in the neighborhood,"" he told me on a recent visit to his home. Gutierrez has been living on the top floor for more than 30 years now. He's transformed a small roof terrace into his own observation platform -- to peer down on what he calls Central Havana's ""dirty"" reality. These days, Gutierrez says he's turned to Buddhism to beat his addictions to cheap rum and wild sex. Up in his ninth-floor sanctuary, he's just about out of harm's way. But one teeter and he may just fall -- he says maybe he'll join me for a ""small drink"" down at ground level in the next few days. Gutierrez has rarely been so clean living. He says he's spent most of the last three decades prowling the streets and alleys below. ""Things are continually happening down there. Pornographic, erotic, sociological and anthropological happenings,"" he explained, wide-eyed. Gutierrez's almost 20 works of prose and poetry are foul-mouthed, cynical and scathing. The kinder literary critics have dubbed him the pioneer of ""dirty realism."" His worst critics have condemned him as a crude pornographer -- for example, before you even finish the first page of his acclaimed ""Dirty Trilogy of Havana,"" there are graphic sexual scenes. ""Some people accuse me of exaggerating, but I say no! The reality is excessive. I have to tone things down to make it believable. It's a very brutal, violent reality, and in order to make it credible, you have to tone it down a bit,"" he says. ""But I am interested in ugliness, the ethics and the aesthetics of the 'dirty ones,' the poorest people who live right on the edge,"" he adds. His bleakest works are centered on the 1990s, during Cuba's so-called Special Period. That was just after the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving its Caribbean ally Cuba to economic wrack and ruin, devoid of subsidies or a market for its goods. But Gutierrez says not a lot has improved since then, at least in Central and Old Havana. ""Everything has stayed the same here. The same poverty, the same misery the same people who are just survivors,"" he said. ""I write about people surviving on the limits."" Jabbing his finger into the afternoon sun, Gutierrez points out Neptuno, Colon, Trocadero and San Lazaro, the four streets that he says once formed Cuba's largest red light district, before the 1959 Revolution. He suggests that prostitution, migration from the countryside to the capital and the disintegration of extended families are the root causes of the chaos he says still reigns in this area. ""There were hundreds or thousands of hookers down there. The people left there today are the daughters and the granddaughters of the hookers. That's important to note in social terms. This was never a normal neighborhood,"" he explained with a grin. Gutierrez worked for 26 years as a journalist for state-run newspapers and magazines. But when he began publishing his crude and critical brand of fiction, he was fired. He's pushed the boundaries of free speech in Cuba but has never been jailed for speaking his mind. He seems to have little intention of keeping quiet. ""I'm soon going to be 65. I have to take advantage of those years to say what I have to say. People don't dare; they just die with their mouths shut. When you have ideas, you have to express them,"" Gutierrez said. His literary depiction of his neighbors here in Central Havana may seem harsh. But walking the streets, you can quickly see he may have a valid point. A few doors from his apartment building, there's the entrance to the local Revolutionary Defense Committee, a neighborhood group set up to promote the values of the Revolution. On the door, a black-and-white photo of a young Fidel Castro. Diagonally opposite is a small store with welded bars at the window. The only thing inside, a huge vat of white rum. A half measure sells for 40 cents and a full 750 ml goes for 80 cents. It was only mid-morning, but a man rooted through the trash outside, pulled out a small plastic bottle and with trembling hands asked for a fill-up. That surely cannot be what Castro -- enshrined in the poster across the street -- had in mind: A land where tourists drink mint-filled mojitos while a few blocks away, an alcoholic worker knocks back a huge slug of  ""train sparks,"" the name Cubans colloquially give to cheap, industrial-strength rum. ""This neighborhood always was on the margins of all the talk of revolutionary ideals. Maybe in the '70s and '80s, when there was some kind of revolutionary pride, it was a little different. But generally, people stayed on the sidelines,"" Gutierrez told me. While his works are bitingly critical of the decades-long social breakdown in his neighborhood, his overall outlook on life and the Cuban system is more nuanced. When Castro and his rebels seized power in 1959, Gutierrez was 7 years old, selling ice cream on Havana's streets. He recalls the brutality of the outgoing dictatorship of General Fulgencio Batista and the celebrations and hopes for newfound freedom ushered in by the rebel forces. ""There was a lot of joy in the first few days. It was like freedom had arrived,"" he said. Despite the experiences of the decades since then, Gutierrez says he still considers himself a ""romantic"" leftist. He rejects suggestions that he has anything in common with Cuba's right-wing dissident movement. ""I think (the regime) is trying to save the good things of socialism and the Revolution like education, health and national pride. We still have to advance a great deal in human rights and personal freedoms,"" he added. For some of Gutierrez's neighbors, change cannot come fast enough. It's past midnight in a dive bar on Galliano Street. A washed-up boxer, Agustin, croons along to a salsa tune on the TV, then asks for a double-strength rum and coke. He says he was a bantamweight Olympic and Pan-American Games champion. When it comes to boxers, Cuba has proved itself to be in a sporting class of its own. But now 50, Agustin has little left to show for his glory years except for a nose like a lump of rubber -- broken so many times, he has no cartilage left. In a hotel bar, a few doors down, on Havana's Malecon waterfront, a 33-year-old woman clad in leopard-print hot pants sips on a Cristal beer and strikes up a conversation. She says police once gave her a ticket for ""harassing tourists,"" official speak for prostitution. She says her day job is a physical education teacher for primary school children. She earns just $10 a month with her state salary and spends that in the bat of one of her false eyelashes. But she says the job provides her with a vital cover story. Having legitimate employment, she says, keeps her out of trouble with the law when she turns tricks at night. She charges her foreign clients $100 a night, if they don't bargain her down, she says. Like many others, she has high hopes that she will be able to cash in on the potential influx of American tourists, after President Barack Obama's announcement of more stable U.S.-Cuba relations. But back up the street, Gutierrez is not convinced there will be a quick fix to those relations. The problem, he says, are elderly Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits. ""For more than half a century, there's been a lot of hatred between Cubans in the U.S. and those on the island. There's been a lot of thirst for revenge. We have to wait for the years to pass and the old men to die,"" he says. ""Only then can we resolve things in a civilized way.""","Cuban author Pedro Juan Gutierrez  says he is interested in the ethics of the poorest .

"The passageway that zigzagged underground between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, was so sophisticated that officials call it a ""super tunnel."" The drug tunnel stretched the length of nearly six football fields and had lighting, ventilation and an electric rail system, authorities said Thursday. It was 35 feet deep, 4 feet tall and 3 feet wide. And it was built by one of Mexico's most notorious criminal organizations, the Sinaloa cartel, U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy told reporters. And now three people are in custody and could face federal charges after investigators seized more than 8 tons of marijuana and 325 pounds of cocaine linked to the tunnel, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement. Word of the detentions comes a day after investigators shut down what they described as the newly completed and ""highly sophisticated"" tunnel, which connected a warehouse in Mexico with another warehouse in a California industrial park. Duffy said that authorities have a message for cartels tied to drug tunnels. ""If you continue to build and attempt to use these tunnels, we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money,"" she said. ""Not only will we take your drugs and shut down your tunnels before you even get an opportunity to use them, but we're now in a position where we're going after your management."" Prosecutors are reviewing charges against the detained individuals and expect they will be filed later Thursday, according to Duffy. The discovery was made by the San Diego Tunnel Task Force, which includes members of ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Authorities compared the find to other ""super tunnels"" discovered along the border in recent years. ""It was just two years ago, November 2011, that we discovered and shut down two elaborate super tunnels like the one here today,"" Duffy said. ""And at the time we did so, we stood before you and we warned the cartels directly. If you build them, we're going find them, and if we find them, we're going to destroy them. Today, we again make good on that promise."" The Sinaloa cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed, is one of the most powerful drug-trafficking groups in the nation. Leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's nickname, which means ""shorty,"" matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug smuggling business. Forbes magazine has estimated that ""El Chapo"" is worth $1 billion. The U.S. Treasury Department has declared him the most influential trafficker in the world, and Mexican authorities have been on his tail since his 2001 escape from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart. Officials said the drugs seized as part of this week's tunnel investigation had an estimated street value of nearly $12 million.","Authorities say seized drugs had a street value of nearly $12 million .

"Days after the Democrats' brutal defeat in the midterm elections, President Obama said Sunday that he takes responsibility for his party's poor performance at the polls. ""The buck stops right here at my desk,"" the President said in an interview on CBS' Face the Nation. ""And so whenever -- as the head of the party -- it doesn't do well, I've got to take responsibility for it."" Ahead of the election, Obama's approval rating was at presidential low, with more than half of all Americans saying they disapproved of the job the President was doing and only 41% saying they approved. Vulnerable candidates in key battleground states made efforts to distance themselves from the commander-in-chief, with some publicly condemning his policies and others refusing his surrogacy on the campaign trail. Reflecting on what he could have done differently and what he will change moving forward, Obama says he will work harder to become a better salesman. ""I think that one thing that I do need to constantly remind myself and my team of is it's not enough just to build a better mousetrap. People don't automatically come beating to your door. We've got to sell it,"" Obama said. ""We've got to reach out to the other side and, where possible, persuade."" ""I think that what you'll see is a constant effort to improve the way we deliver service to customers...experimenting with ways that I can reach out to Republicans more effectively. Making sure that we're reaching out and using the private sector more effectively."" Looking back, the President admits that he sometimes struggled to work politics into policy negotiations, a weakness that affected his ability to communicate his positions to members of the opposite party and to the American people. ""I think there are times -- there's no doubt about it -- where, you know, I think we have not been successful in going out there and letting people know what it is that we're trying to do and why this is the right direction,"" Obama said. ""So there is a failure of politics there that we've got to improve on."" It's a somber moment for the former senator, who will lead his last two years in the Oval Office determining whether or not to veto or sign bills coming from a Republican-led Congress. In retrospect, he now says he is learning to become a better legislator-in-chief. ""One of the things we're learning is that there's a real power to being able to convene here in the White House. Not every problem has to be solved just through a bill. Just through legislation,"" Obama said. The day following the midterms, the President addressed the country, saying he heard voters and their concerns through the polls. On Sunday, he detailed what that meant. ""The message that I took from this election, and we've seen this in a number of elections, successive elections, is people want to see this city work,"" Obama said. ""They see Washington gridlocked and they're frustrated. And they know one person in Washington and that's the President of the United States."" Obama isn't the first, and won't be the last, president to see his party get swept in the final midterm elections during a two-term presidency. But now after witnessing his final election from the Oval Office, he says that he's realized ""campaigning and governance are two different things."" ""I've ran two successful campaigns,"" Obama said. ""And anybody who's seen me on the campaign trail can tell how much I love just being with the American people. And hearing what they care about and how passionate I am about trying to help them."" ""When you start governing there is a tendency sometimes, for me, to start thinking, 'As long as I get the policy right, then that's what should matter.'  And people have asked, 'What do you need to do differently going forward?'  And I think you do that gut check after every election."" In hindsight, Obama acknowledges that his critics were fair to condemn him for not trying hard enough to work with Republicans, saying he could have pushed harder to negotiate and get things done. ""I think that what is also true is that no matter how frustrating it can sometimes be for any president to deal with an opposition that is, you know, pretty stubborn and where there are really strong differences, you've just got to keep on trying.""

"(CNN)According to a new study released by Oxfam, the rich have made tremendous gains in the past several years -- to the point where, analysts predict, by 2016 the world's wealthiest 1% will control more than 50% of the world's wealth. The 80 wealthiest people in the world, alone, own $1.9 trillion. In the United States, the top 1% control more than one third of the nation's resources. Two out of three Americans disapprove of the current distribution of income and wealth. They believe that our economy and government unfairly favor the rich. One of the major contributors to rising inequality is our tax system.  Raising taxes on the very wealthy is an idea that appeals to many Americans, including the middle class and poor. In his State of the Union Address on Tuesday night, President Barack Obama will attempt to address this serious issue. He will propose a set of policies to increase taxes paid by big business and the wealthiest Americans and provide tax cuts and credits for America's middle class. Prominent economists think that the government needs to raise taxes on corporations and top earners to benefit the nation as a whole. Republicans, meanwhile, are already apoplectic about President Obama's plan.  One of the more curious phenomena about Republicans is that their economic agenda is entirely independent of the facts of the moment.  So when the economy is strong, Republicans demand tax cuts for the rich.  When the economy is weak, Republicans demand tax cuts for the rich.  When the economy is recovering, Republicans demand tax cuts for the rich. But the massive tax cuts for the wealthy under President George W. Bush didn't stave off the recession and arguably precipitated or worsened the fall. Moreover, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has conclusively determined that tax cuts for the rich do not spur economic growth.  To the contrary, there's evidence that tax cuts hurt growth.  In fact, the only thing tax cuts unequivocally do, according to the study?  Tax cuts increase economic inequality. President Obama is also proposing fees to make it more costly for the biggest financial companies to excessively borrow money. Post-recession, corporate profits have soared, but wages for Americans workers have not.  Once upon a time, corporate profits used to correlate more closely with economic growth and wage prosperity for average Americans. In other words, we used to do well all together. But increasingly, especially in the past decade thanks to Republican tax cuts and deregulations, corporations have succeeded while ordinary Americans have fallen behind.  How else do we explain the stock market hitting record highs while many Americans are still out of work?  This runaway train of inequality won't solve itself.  We need government action -- action the majority of Americans strongly support. In his State of the Union address, President Obama will argue for closing the ""trust fund loophole,"" which, according to the White House, is one of the biggest tax loopholes plaguing our economy and lets the wealthiest Americans avoid hundreds of billions in taxes every year, money that should be helping build roads and schools that help us all. President Obama will also propose raising the top capital gains and dividend rates back to what they were under President Ronald Reagan, which clearly Republicans once agreed was a sufficient level.  And to hedge the sort of gambling that puts our entire economy at risk, President Obama will propose a fee on the nation's largest financial firms in proportion to how heavily they borrow and leverage. These modest measures will help us reinvest in America's middle class and strengthen our economy for everyone's benefit.  Among the President's proposals is a $500 tax credit for second earners in families where both spouses work, a proposal that will benefit 24 million American families. The President will endorse tripling the child care tax benefit, to help 5.1 million American families cover the cost of child care.  President Obama will provide students with up to $2,500 a year toward the cost of college and make the first two years of community college free.  And President Obama's plan includes giving 30 million more workers the opportunity to easily and automatically save for retirement through their employers. While American voters across the board think that Democrats help the poor, middle class and rich fairly equally, 69% think Republican Party policies favor the rich. Even conservative voters are concerned about rising inequality. The political pressure is on the GOP to prove they're not just the party of the 1%. There are some encouraging signs that Republicans believe tax reform should include increasing the share paid by the wealthiest Americans.  President Obama's plan is a modest and effective set of policies that sensible Republicans can support. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. We've cut taxes on big businesses and the rich to near historic lows.  Those tax cuts have only helped corporate profits and yacht sales.  It's time that our economic policy helps all Americans. In this economic and political climate, not supporting basic tax fairness is insane.","New study indicates that by 2016, the world's wealthiest 1% will control more than 50% of the world's wealth .
President Obama is right in his SOTU address to address the widening inequality and to propose taxes on the rich .
Republicans need to recognize that they can't just be the party of the 1% and support Obama's modest proposals ."

"The Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds, ruling Wednesday private parties do not have ""standing"" to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. The ruling clears the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume. The 5-4 decision avoids, for now, a sweeping conclusion on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional ""equal protection"" right that would apply to all states. Read the ruling . At issue was whether the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage to exclude same-sex couples, and whether a state can revoke same-sex marriage through referendum, as California did, once it already has been recognized. But a majority of the Supreme Court opted not to rule on those issues. Instead, it ruled on ""standing"" -- whether those who brought the suit to the court were entitled to do so. ""We have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend a state statute when state officials have chosen not to,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. He was supported by an unusual coalition: fellow conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and more liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. By dismissing the case, the court leaves in place the lower court decision in California that allows same-sex marriage to be reinstated. The federal appeals court stay on the decision will be lifted. What's next for gay rights movement? Within hours of the ruling, California's Gov. Jerry Brown said, ""I have directed the California Department of Public Health to advise the state's counties that they must begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in California as soon as the Ninth Circuit confirms the stay is lifted."" Brown, a Democrat, said he interpreted the high court opinion as making Prop 8 unconstitutional and unenforceable. The state's Attorney General Kamala Harris agreed and urged the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco to issue its mandate ""immediately."" But by law, that cannot normally be done so for at least 25 days, to allow for possible new legal challenges. As soon as the court lifts the stay, ""the wedding bells will ring"" said Harris on Wednesday. ""This is a huge day for California."" But there is legal uncertainty whether the high court's ruling could be enforced statewide, or limited to only a few jurisdictions. It was act two in a closely watched pair of high court appeals over state and federal laws and the limits of recognizing the ability of gay and lesbian couples to wed. The outcome of the rulings gives same-sex couples much to be encouraged about. California voters approved Proposition 8 in 2008 with 52% of the vote shortly after the state Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriages are legal. The measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold in the state, but a federal appeals court later rule Proposition 8 was unconstitutional. Two of the original plaintiffs -- Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo, a Burbank, California, couple who want to marry but could not because of Proposition 8 -- contended the state was discriminating against them because of their sexuality. ""This is about our freedom and our liberty,"" Katami told CNN. ""We are not trying to topple marriage. We are not trying to redefine marriage. What we are trying to say is that equality is the backbone of our country."" Both they and Kristin Perry and Sandy Stier, the other plaintiff couple from Berkeley, were in the courtroom when the rulings came out. They were cheered when emerging from the court building. Their views were echoed by fellow same-sex marriage supporters, who rallied outside the court with the hope that the justices will eventually issue a broad ruling to strike down bans nationwide. In dissent, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the court's majority ignored the initiative process that led to the passage of Proposition 8. Key quotes from the ruling . ""What the court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process. And it is this. The essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government, not the other way around. Freedom resides first in the people without need of a grant from government,"" he said. ""The California initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for over a century. ... In California and the 26 other states that permit initiatives and popular referendums, the people have exercised their own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves. The court today frustrates that choice."" Kennedy was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor. Some Prop 8 supporters argued the high court ruling means the voter referendum remains in place and enforceable. ""Proposition 8 being the law of the state of California makes it clear that marriage is only one man and one woman. The four plaintiffs that brought this lawsuit may have a right to get marriage licenses issued to them. But this was not a class-action lawsuit. It does not apply statewide, "" said Austin Nimocks, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom. ""Because there's no appellate decision holding it unconstitutional under the California Constitution, which is what controls this interpretation, Proposition 8 remains the law of that state. Kevin has a family: A same-sex couple's remarkable journey . The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (12-144).","The high court opts not to consider the issues of the appeal .

"The light bulb figuratively suspended above a human head has long been symbolic of the eureka moment that every inventor craves. But for German physicist Herald Haas, it's the bulb itself that provides the inspiration for his bright idea. Haas and his team at the UK's University of Edinburgh, are the brains behind a new patented technology that uses beams of flickering light to transmit digital information wirelessly, a process known as Visible Light Communication (VLC). ""My big idea is to turn light bulbs into broadband communication devices ... so that they not only provide illumination, but an essential utility,"" he says. Haas claims that data can be sent by adding a microchip to any humble LED bulb, making it blink on and off at a phenomenal speed, millions of times per second. It's this capability that allows LEDs to transmit data in a rapid stream of binary code that, although invisible to the naked eye, can then be detected by a light-sensitive receiver. Read more: 'Teach young to be innovative' ""It's a bit like sending a Morse code signal with a torch, but at a much faster rate and using the alphabet that computers understand,"" explains Haas. The implication is that wherever you have a light bulb -- and there are an estimated 14 billion of them worldwide -- you have the potential for a wireless Internet connection. In practice, it means that any street lamp could double up as a web hotspot. But VLC, or ""Li-Fi"" as it has been nicknamed, does more than just increase Internet accessibility. The dominant technology used for wireless data transfer, Wi-Fi, is transmitted through radio wave signals. However, radio waves represent only a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum and so, as demand for wireless connectivity grows, the supply of available bandwidth diminishes. The problem is epitomized by the frustrating experience of sitting in an Internet coffee shop, helplessly watching on as more and more people connect their device to the network, causing your browser speed to wither to a snail's pace. The same is true for 3G mobile networks, which rely on an increasingly congested system of around 1.4 million cellular radio masts worldwide. Meanwhile, the number of bytes we transmit through mobile devices is doubling every year, according to a report from networking equipment giant Cisco Systems. However, Haas claims his technology should be a big part of the solution. Test your knowledge of accidental inventions . ""The visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger than the radio frequency spectrum,"" he explains. Less congestion means greater bandwidth and Haas says transmission rates using ""Li-Fi"" could be as high as one gigabit a second -- meaning that downloads of high-definition films could take less time than sending a text. For Haas, the beauty of his technology is that -- unlike radio wave signals that are generated from large energy-intensive cell masts -- VLC requires almost no new infrastructure. ""We use what is already there,"" he says. ""The visible light spectrum is unused, it's not regulated, and we can communicate at very high speeds."" But the technology has its limitations. Thomas Kamalakis, a lecturer at the Department of Informatics and Telematics at the Harokopio University of Athens, commends Haas on his work but warns against overstating its potential just yet. Watch Make Create Innovate on Quest Means Business . ""Of course one problem is that light can't pass through objects, so if the receiver is inadvertently blocked in any way, then the signal will immediately cut out,"" Kamalakis says. Mark Leeson, associate professor at Warwick University's School of Engineering also foresees challenges. ""The question is how will my mobile phone communicate back with the light source?"" Leeson asks. Both are valid issues, Haas says, but he has a simple workaround. ""If the light signal is blocked, or when you need to use your device to send information -- you can seamlessly switch back over to radio waves."" VLC is not in competition with WiFi, he says, it is a complimentary technology that should eventually help free up much needed space within the radio wave spectrum. ""We still need Wi-Fi, we still need radio frequency cellular systems. You can't have a light bulb that provides data to a high-speed moving object or to provide data in a remote area where there are trees and walls and obstacles behind,"" he says. Although the widespread use of ""Li-Fi"" is still some way off, it could have some useful, small scale, applications in the short term. For instance, Haas says it could transform air travel by allowing overhead cabin lights to connect mobiles and laptops in-flight; it could also improve conditions for those working underwater -- such as people on oil rigs -- where radio waves cannot penetrate; LED car lights could even alert drivers when other vehicles are too close. Haas also turns one of the technology's perceived weaknesses -- the inability of light to penetrate through objects -- into a strength. ""LiFi offers a far more secure form of data transfer because it can only be intercepted by those within a line of sight of the light source,"" he explains. ""It's a very simple electromagnetic spectrum we can see, and if that is an engine that also provides some of the fundamental needs of modern societies [like] high-speed data communication, wouldn't that be brilliant?""","German inventor Harald Haas has developed patented technology which uses light beams to transmit information .

Haas hopes his ""Li-Fi"" networks will assist increasingly crowded Wi-Fi radio networks ."
"(CNN)After the Paris attacks by al Qaeda-aligned Islamic terrorists, much of the world -- even some Muslim world leaders -- seems united in the defense of free speech and freedom of religion. And at the Golden Globes recently, Hollywood declared its aversion to attacks on liberty, mocking North Korea's Kim Jong Un for trying to shut down the movie ""The Interview"" and announcing its united front with France against terrorism. ""Je suis Charlie,"" said Jared Leto. ""Together we will stand united against anyone who would oppress free speech,"" said Hollywood Foreign Press Association president Theo Kingma. George Clooney talked about the millions who marched for unity in Paris: ""They marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear. We won't do it."" The tech world, too, has pledged its support of life and liberty in the wake of the Sony hack and Paris attacks. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for a rejection of ""extremists trying to silence the voices and opinions of everyone else around the world."" Google featured a black ribbon on its homepage and Apple put a banner with the words ""Je Suis Charlie"" on its French website. This is all very fine and good, of course. The horrific slayings of French police officers, French cartoonists and four Jews at a grocery store should be the kind of shock to the system that brings even the most disparate of groups together, and maybe even jolts them out of the false sense of security that al Qaeda's ""leadership ranks have been decimated"" or that Islamic extremism can be thwarted by efforts at multiculturalism. Many are united in horror, but one only needs to look back at some recent examples of other horrifying atrocities to know that mere symbolism and solidarity -- what I call the weapons of ""soft outrage"" -- will not be enough to stamp out terrorism in Europe or anywhere else. It's been eight months since Boko Haram militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls in Chibok, Nigeria, and they are still missing, despite U.S. first lady Michelle Obama's best efforts at soft outrage, joining a Twitter campaign to #BringBackOurGirls. Even though it went viral, and everyone from Hillary Clinton to British Prime Minister David Cameron chimed in, hashtag activism hasn't proven very effective in the face of violent Islamic extremism. Last week reports that a shudder-inducing 2,000 people were killed in Nigeria once again shocked Western audiences, who then learned that most of the victims were reportedly children, women and the elderly. The BBC estimates that Boko Haram now controls 70% of Nigeria's Borno state. In another corner of Africa, Darfur remains a ghastly site of untold violence and genocide that has spanned 10 years, wiped out hundreds of thousands and displaced millions. Last October there was reportedly a mass rape in the village of Tabit, Sudan, as tribal fighting rages on. But this weekend the Golden Globes honored Clooney with a lifetime achievement award, for his work in film but also for raising awareness of Darfur's plight. What has all that awareness accomplished? Not much, as the Guardian recently learned. It asked people who have lived and worked in the region ""What happened to Darfur after George Clooney came to town?"" As one resident put it: . ""Clooney might be doing something fantastic -- tracking the movements of Sudanese troops and militias -- but for me as a person living in Darfur, in touch with what is happening on daily basis, I don't see that it has halted, or even reduced, the genocide. The killing, displacement, sexual assaults and rape never stopped."" While awareness and solidarity aren't unimportant, ""soft outrage"" is useless in stopping terrorism and genocide. These things often require force, the kind of intervention that tends to make soft outragers uncomfortable. If Clooney, for example, truly cares about the people of Darfur (and I'm certain that he does), I would hope he accepts that ""awareness"" alone will not end the genocide there -- only force will. Hashtag diplomacy isn't an actual solution to a terrifying, real problem. But military intervention to ""bring back our girls"" or stop the horrific atrocities in Nigeria could well be. Europe must accept that unity marches and inclusion rhetoric won't protect freedom of speech or religion against extremists determined to attack them. France has recommitted to attacking ISIS in Iraq along with the U.S., but will it  join in strikes against ISIS in Syria, or al Qaeda terrorists in the Arabian Peninsula and elsewhere? Silicon Valley must accept that Facebook posts and website banners won't prevent terrorists -- whether ISIS or actors like Kim Jong Un -- from attacking Western values and Western infrastructure. Will Facebook, Google and Apple support the necessary investments in our national defense that will help better protect our values and our companies? Maybe you don't believe that the United States should involve itself politically or militarily in these conflicts around the world. That's a reasonable position, even if I disagree with it. But let's not kid ourselves into thinking our soft outrage is either effective or noble. It's lovely to see all these folks ""stand with France."" But standing isn't doing, and the hard truth is that symbolism is no match for the fanatics who want us exterminated. Are they ready to back up their rhetoric with action?","S.E.

"The latest chapter in Amanda Knox's long legal battle began Monday in Florence, Italy, with a retrial over the 2007 killing of her British roommate Meredith Kercher. But Knox, 26, who has expressed concern about returning to a country where she spent four years behind bars, was not in court. Neither was Kercher's family, which said in a statement submitted by their lawyer in court on Monday that they would be following the new trial closely from the United Kingdom. Knox was convicted in 2009 of murdering Kercher, a 21-year old British exchange student who was found stabbed to death in November 2007 in the villa the two young women rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. Family: Amanda Knox won't return to Italy for new trial . The convictions of Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were overturned in 2011 for ""lack of evidence."" After her acquittal, Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle, where she has been living since. Knox: Sometimes, I can't stop crying . But Italy's Supreme Court decided last year to retry the case, saying the jury that acquitted Knox didn't consider all the evidence, and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. The retrial's opening day Monday was dominated by procedural items. The presiding judge, Alessandro Nencini,  read out the facts of the case, including the conviction of Ivory Coast native Rudy Guede for his role in Kercher's murder. The defense teams asked for several items of evidence to be retested for DNA, and Nencini agreed that a knife found in Sollecito's apartment would be re-examined. The court also agreed to hear testimony from Luciano Aviello, who served time in jail with Sollecito and claims that his brother killed Kercher. Also absent from the proceedings Monday was Giuliano Mignini, the Perugia prosecutor who won the original conviction and then lost the appeal. However, Patrick Lumumba, the Congolese bartender Knox originally accused of Kercher's murder was in court. Lumumba spent several weeks in jail after Knox accused him, and he won a defamation suit against her, for which she was ordered to pay €22,000 ($29,800) for his court costs.  Also in the gallery were Perugia residents who attended the original trials. Court was adjourned until Friday, when Aviello will testify. A verdict is expected by the end of the year. Afraid to go back . Knox has said she's scared to return to Italy. ""I'm afraid to go back there,"" she said in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo in May. ""I don't want to go back into prison."" The high court also said evidence could support prosecutors' initial argument -- that Kercher was killed in a twisted sex game gone wrong. Knox has said such claims are ""a bombardment of falsehood and fantasy."" Italian court on reason for retrial: Evidence neglected . ""No one has ever claimed that I was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity. None of my roommates, none of my friends, none of the people who knew me there. This is simply coming out of the prosecution,"" she told CNN in May. ""I was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip. I have never done that. I have never taken part in an orgy. Ever."" The Supreme Court's decision to send the case back to the appeal court for retrial ""may be interpreted by the American authorities as double jeopardy -- twice tried for the same fact or the same case,"" said Riccardo Montana, a law lecturer at City University in London. ""In Italy it's not like this, because this is still the same trial."" Sollecito, Knox's former boyfriend, said he plans to stay in the Dominican Republic with a friend. He said he has no immediate plans to return to Italy. Watching from afar . If the court convicts her, Knox will be ordered to return to Italy. If she refuses, Italy could request her extradition from the United States. But it's not clear if American authorities would comply. Opinion: We're obsessed when it's white women in trouble . Knox has said she would be willing to take a lie detector test. ""I'd do anything to prove my innocence,"" she told CNN affiliate ITV earlier this month. ""I don't think that is necessary. But like I said, I'm doing everything to prove my innocence. It's just very sad that's what it has come to."" Knox isn't the only person watching the retrial from afar. Citing health reasons, Kercher's family said in a statement that they decided not to return to Italy for the beginning of the trial after speaking ""at great length."" ""It is an extremely stressful time for us all and we desperately want to find truth and justice for Meredith, who was so brutally and unnecessarily taken from us, and so we have decided to support each other in the UK and follow closely here,"" the statement said. The family said they would remain in close contact with their lawyer, who was in the courtroom Monday. ""We trust that the evidence will be reviewed and any additional testing requested to be granted so that any unanswered questions can be clarified and the court can clearly decide the next steps in this tragic case,"" the statement said.

"Three days before the Boston Marathon bombings, suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were working out together at a Boston gym. Security cameras captured footage of the brothers arriving at the Wai Kru mixed martial arts center with a friend just before 2:45 p.m. April 12. The manager at Wai Kru, who wanted to be identified only as Michael, noticed a distinct change in the older brother's appearance. Tamerlan Tsarnaev's full, bushy religious beard, which he had for about two years, was gone. Michael described the older brother as extremely opinionated and outspoken about his Muslim religion. He said he didn't ask Tamerlan why he had shaved because he didn't want to engage in what was likely to be a long, heated debate. Now, Michael wonders whether Tamerlan's shaving of his beard may have been part of an Islamic purification ritual prior to death. ""Shaving the beard may be a way to blend in, not to attract scrutiny from security services in carrying out the Boston attacks,"" CNN terror analyst Paul Cruickshank said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev trained at Wai Kru several times a month, for free, as a professional courtesy to the nationally ranked Golden Gloves boxer. His younger brother Dzhokhar rarely came, showing up just ""two or three times"" in roughly two years, Michael said. ""We've seen with Western militants, wanna-be jihadists, a real emphasis on physical training, physical fitness, wanting to be prepared for jihad,"" Cruickshank said. In surveillance video recorded at Wai Kru and obtained by CNN, the manager -- who was off-camera -- asked the brothers to take off their shoes, as stated on the gym's posted rules. Suspect: Boston bombing was payback for hits on Muslims . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, complies right away. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, refuses to take off his shoes and argues instead. The manager later e-mailed the owner asking him to ban Tamerlan Tsarnaev, saying he's arrogant, selfish and never helps anyone else. But the argument at the the gym that day didn't seem to faze Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was the first to enter the ring. His years of training were evident as he skillfully handled the jump rope. His younger brother seemed to have more difficulty and less stamina as he struggled to hold up his oversized shorts. Another man who was with the brothers was introduced as a friend, the manager said. He was later questioned and released by the FBI. The brothers seemed relaxed at the gym -- though Dzhokhar rested at times and Tamerlan kept moving. Almost exactly 72 hours later, the bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. In the chaotic days that followed, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police shootout, and his younger brother was captured after hiding in a boat in nearby Watertown, Massachusetts. FBI agents have seen the security footage from Wai Kru but were in a rush and took only a few screen grabs for still photos. The manager said he notified investigators about another Chechen -- Ibragim Todashev, a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's who also worked out at the gym. Todashev was shot and killed last week by an FBI agent. He was being questioned about a triple homicide on September 11, 2011. One of the victims from that triple homicide used to spar with Tamerlan -- at the Wai Kru gym.","The manager noticed Tamerlan Tsarnaev suddenly lost the full beard he had for years .

The ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Bowling for Columbine"" director later expanded on his remarks, saying: ""But if you're on the roof of your home defending it from invaders who've come 7K miles, you are not a sniper, u are brave, u are a neighbor."" Moore has long been a staunch advocate for stricter gun control laws in the U.S., and his statements are known to court controversy. His latest comments quickly prompted backlash.

"(CNN)It was 3:30 in the morning when Robert Alan Black was escorted into Khalifa jail. An American in Abu Dhabi, he found himself frightened even though the other prisoners were sleeping. Movie scenes from ""Midnight Express"" and ""Brubaker"" swirled through his head. He sat at a table in the common area, waiting for the others to wake, not knowing what the reaction would be to his presence. Black, who has a degree in architecture, three master's degrees and a doctorate in educational psychology, was in Abu Dhabi, the capital of United Arab Emirates, for October's Creative Thinkers Conference. He was to present a workshop and emcee the event. On a Tuesday morning, the 70-year-old got up early to take a walk in the neighborhoods near his hotel. An avid photographer, Black took his camera to snap photos of houses and a couple of the mosques he passed. When he left the second mosque, he was approached by a man in uniform. He motioned Black to get into a camouflaged truck. ""I had no idea what he wanted,"" Black said, ""but never felt threatened so I got in."" He was driven a short distance to a building with a sign out front that read ""Reception."" He waited about an hour before he was guided back outside and told, ""Do not photograph security areas."" Black asked for clarification, but he was waved away with no further explanation, he said. He decided to continue his walk. A few blocks away, he came upon a sign on a lamppost that said in English, ""Photography Forbidden."" Thinking a photo of the sign would make for a novel Facebook post, he snapped an image. After crossing the road, he was approached by two other uniformed men in a second camouflaged truck and waved into the backseat. He was driven back to ""Reception,"" which Black believes was a police station, where his passport, camera and cell phone were seized. Black tried to keep his composure. He was questioned and moved to different rooms, waiting for hours at a time, but the process was civil, he said. No one harmed him in any way. After eight or nine hours at the police station, a man came in and asked him to stand. His hands and feet were shackled and a hood was put over his head. He was escorted to an SUV where his wrists were chained to the floor. After hours more of interrogation, he was driven to the Khalifa jail. When the sun rose that morning, Black was relieved to be greeted with smiles from the other inmates. A few prisoners from the Philippines spoke English. Their conversation revolved around why Black was there and the daily routine at the jail. Later in the day, police took him back to his hotel and allowed him to retrieve his belongings and check out of the hotel. Concerned friends and family called the hotel but couldn't obtain any information on his whereabouts. After Black spent about a week in jail, a translator for the prosecutor's office felt bad about his plight and Googled his name, Black later learned. The translator contacted some of his associates, which is how friends and family members learned what had happened to him. He was quickly transferred to al-Wathba prison, where he met a Syrian in his mid-30s named Kousai. ""All of those who could speak any English were very supportive and helpful"" in both the prison and the jail, Black recalled, but Kousai made the most concerted effort. Well-educated, he had a master's degree in business administration from Florida State University and spoke fluent English. Black called him the cell blocks's ""den mother."" He was always trying to help and facilitate the needs of the prisoners who came from countries such as Oman, Yemen, Nigeria and Egypt -- all of them foreign workers. Kousai himself had been in prison for six months on an immigration violation. When Black first walked in, Kousai and his roommate, a massive man everyone called ""The Foreman,"" offered him an orange drink and crackers. ""The Foreman"" didn't speak much English, Black said, but seemed to be in charge of the cell block. Kousai helped Black settle into the facility, making sure he had snacks and arranging for Black to have his prison clothes laundered. In one act of kindness, Kousai was chatting with his wife on the prison phone and asked Black if there was anyone he wanted to contact. Kousai's wife called Black's daughter on her cell phone and connected the two on the same phone line. It was the first time that Black had been able to talk to someone outside of the prison or jail. His family finally knew first-hand where he was and what had happened to him. As the weeks dragged on, Black became immersed in prison life. He walked the cell block halls to pass time, often recalling humorous episodes of ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Frasier"" to buoy his spirits. He and the other prisoners told jokes or talked about funny movies to help inject humor in their otherwise serious world. When he got down about his situation, many of the prisoners would ask him to join their conversations, share cookies and boxed drinks they had bought from the canteen or offer food they had cooked in their cells. If the prisoner didn't speak English, a simple smile or thumbs up was offered. Black was grateful for the acts of friendship, and he made an effort to reciprocate, he said. Meanwhile, Black's family, friends and colleagues were raising money to hire an Abu Dhabi attorney and working official channels to get Black released. They called themselves FAB, Friends of Alan Black. The U.S. Embassy sent representatives to meet with Black several times while he was at al-Wathba. Many of the prisoners and guards told him he would be out soon, but the days dragged on. He continued to endure the daily routines of incarceration while waiting for his case to go before a judge. Black was the only Westerner in his cell block, though he believes he saw a few others in the prison, he said. Besides a Nigerian man, he was the only Christian. The rest, if they had religious beliefs, were Muslim. Five times a day, the devout would roll out their prayer mats. Black never spoke much about religion with the other inmates, he said, and he never felt any animosity aimed toward him for being a Christian. He had no biases against Muslims, and they had no predispositions about him. In fact, many of the inmates told Black they prayed he would be released soon, he said. On November 17, almost a month after his arrest, a lawyer pleaded Black's case before the superior court's three-judge panel. ""He was very passionate and forceful,"" Black said. ""He told the judges that he thought the case was an embarrassment and that I should have been fined and released the first day."" The judges agreed and ruled Black ""not guilty, no intent to do harm."" He was fined 500 dirham, around $135 dollars, the minimum fine allowed by the court system. It was later waived because of time served. It took about 28 hours to get fully processed, and Black immediately made his way to the airport and flew back home to Athens, Georgia. Black was grateful about how quickly his case was ultimately resolved, he said. Some of the prisoners he met had been in prison for years, and many still hadn't seen their case presented in court. The support of his family and friends was important, Black said, but he considered prisoners such as Kousai his ""angels."" It was their generosity of spirit, humor and kindness that made a bad situation tolerable. The episode reinforced Black's belief that while differences exist among cultures, in the end ""we are all human beings."" ""Sometimes it takes something like this to show you people will reach out when you need it,"" he said. ""It's important to be open to your emotions and know people care."" Black plans to keep in touch with some of the men he met in prison, he said, and has already Skyped with Kousai, who was recently released and is back in Damascus.","Robert Alan Black was imprisoned in October for taking a photograph in Abu Dhabi .

"Tennis ace Serena Williams clarified Wednesday the controversial comments she made in a magazine article about the victim's role in the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case that garnered national headlines earlier this year. In March, two high school football players were convicted of raping a drunk teen at a party and posting pictures of the incident online. In an upcoming issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Williams talks about the convicted rapists after a news report about the case appeared on a nearby TV screen during the interview. ""Do you think it was fair, what they got? They did something stupid, but I don't know. I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk like that, your parents should teach you: Don't take drinks from other people,"" she told Rolling Stone. Of the victim, Williams also says in the interview: ""She's 16, why was she that drunk where she doesn't remember? It could have been much worse. She's lucky. Obviously, I don't know, maybe she wasn't a virgin, but she shouldn't have put herself in that position, unless they slipped her something, then that's different."" The comments, posted on Rolling Stone's website Tuesday, immediately caused a firestorm on social media, particularly on Twitter where users castigated the tennis star. On Wednesday, Williams released a statement on her website clarifying her remarks. ""What happened in Steubenville was a real shock for me. I was deeply saddened. For someone to be raped, and at only sixteen, is such a horrible tragedy! For both families involved -- that of the rape victim and of the accused,"" she wrote. ""I am currently reaching out to the girl's family to let her know that I am deeply sorry for what was written in the Rolling Stone article. What was written -- what I supposedly said -- is insensitive and hurtful, and I by no means would say or insinuate that she was at all to blame,"" Williams added. Stephen Rodrick, who wrote the Rolling Stone article, stands by his reporting, telling the Poynter Institute: ""The interview is on tape. Other than that, I'll let the story speak for itself.""","Serena Williams clarifies comments on Steubenville rape published in Rolling Stone .

"Dad and I love baseball and hate sleep. It only made sense that, one midsummer dawn when I was 9, we drove to the local park with our baseballs, gloves and Yankee caps. No time is too early for a father-son catch. ""If you thought night baseball was a thrill, just wait,"" Dad told me. ""Morning air carries the ball like you've never seen."" Once we hit the dew-sprinkled field a few minutes later, I learned he was right. Our fastballs charged faster and landed lighter into each other's mitts. The echoes of our back-and-forth catches popped louder. And it was all as the sun rose and most of my suburban New York town slept. The park was all ours for about two hours. Then a young mother pushed her stroller, complete with a kicking newborn, toward us. Dad paused our catch to sip from a nearby water fountain. When the mother and child neared, he politely leaned into the stroller, waved and gave the baby his best smile. But because the Bell's palsy still lingered, his grin looked more like a smirk. The mother found his smile condescending. She ogled at him for a second or two, then rushed her stroller away. Dad hid his mouth in his hand and walked to the car. He wanted to go home. ""Let's go, bud,"" he said. ""I'm not feeling well."" A month earlier, Bell's palsy had struck Dad, paralyzing the right side of his face. It drooped his eyelid and left him slurring words. He could hardly drink from a cup or bottle without liquid spilling onto his neck and shirt. And his smile, which once eased the pain of playground cuts and burst at the mention of Mick Jagger's strut, Woody Allen's films or his very own Yankees, was gone. As I slumped into the car, I began suspecting that our sunrise park visit wasn't about watching daylight lift beneath us. Dad had spent weeks lamenting the loss of his smile. This was his effort to avoid stares. It was a solemn drive home. I killed time by curving my cap's brim and fidgeting between songs on the radio dial. We returned home and he went to bed. Lying down but unable to nod off, he simply spent a few hours sighing and groaning toward the ceiling. After that morning, Dad and I didn't visit parks, nor did he want to play catch. He spent more time indoors. He left the shopping, driving and Little League games to Mom. Since being a freelance editor enabled him to work from home, he turned our dining room into his office and buried himself in manuscripts. When Dad wasn't at his desk, he attended physical therapy. He obeyed the doctor's orders: ""Now smile as wide as you can ... Now lift your right cheek with your hand ... Now try to whistle."" Only the sound of blowing air came out. My earliest childhood memories were of Dad whistling to songs on the radio. He didn't care if the station was playing Frank Sinatra or Bobby McFerrin. He always whistled along. He taught me to whistle, too. Of the roughly 40,000 Americans that the National Institutes of Health says are afflicted with Bell's palsy each year, most recover within several weeks. Other cases take a few months to heal. But after nine weeks of therapy, Dad's face hardly improved, and the doctor confessed she couldn't do much more to help. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" she told him after his final session. Then she handed him the bill. Rather than calling another doctor or physical therapist, Dad stuck to humor. He occasionally grabbed washable markers and drew an even-sided grin across his face. Other times, he practiced his Elvis Presley impersonation. He joked that curled lips had already lent him a handicap, thereby giving him more time to perfect his renditions of ""Hound Dog"" and ""Burning Love."" The effort -- a regimen of shower-time vocal warmups and leg stretches -- paid off. He could soon don white jackets and swing his hips as if he lost himself in the King. By the time I entered fourth grade that September, Dad's case of Bell's palsy had improved. He could blink his right eye and speak clearly again. But his smile still hadn't returned. I tried convincing myself that it didn't matter and that smiling was overrated. So I abstained from making grins of any kind. Nothing about fourth grade made my no-smiling vow easy. Classmates were both old enough to laugh about pop culture and young enough to appreciate fart jokes, burped alphabets and straws in noses. Breaking the promise I made myself was tempting, but I couldn't let Dad not smile alone. I didn't care how hard I needed to bite my lip. I had my critics. Kids would call me ""Frowny the Dwarf."" (It didn't help that I was merely 3-foot-10 at age nine.) Teachers would escort me into hallways, wondering what was wrong. When I asked my physical education coach, ""What's so great about smiling?"" he made me do pushups while the rest of the class played wiffle ball. Then he called Dad. I never learned what Dad discussed with the coach. But when I got off the school bus that afternoon and saw him waiting for me, holding our mitts and ball, it didn't seem to matter. He tapped the brims of our matching Yankee caps. For the first time in months, we got in the family sedan and went to the park for a catch. ""It's been too long,"" he said. The park always bustled on Friday afternoons. When we arrived, young children dashed to the nearby ice cream stand. Mothers kissed boo-boos and gossiped. And roughly a half-dozen fathers and sons lined the field with mitted arms in the air. Even if Dad couldn't smile as widely as the others, he couldn't help but beam; neither could I. Sundown came quickly. The field's white lights glowed and everyone else left the park. But Dad and I didn't tire. We threw everything from curveballs to folly floaters into the night. We had catching up to do.","Harrison Golden's father lost his smile to Bell's palsy in January 2001 .

"(CNN)A few years ago, Glyzelle Palomar was begging for food on the streets of northern Manila. This week, the 12-year-old girl was on a stage in front of tens of thousands of people, asking Pope Francis why God lets children suffer. ""There are many children neglected by their own parents,"" Glyzelle said Sunday at a ceremony at a 400-year-old Catholic university in Manila. ""There are also many who became victims and many terrible things happened to them like drugs or prostitution."" ""Why is God allowing such things to happen, even if it is not the fault of the children?"" she asked the Pope, breaking down into tears as she spoke. Another former street child, Jun Chura, told Pope Francis about his struggle to survive without a home. ""I was feeding myself with what I can find in the garbage,"" said Jun, 14. ""I did not know where to go, and I was sleeping on the sidewalk."" ""When I was in the street, I witness also things I don't like, terrible things that happened to my companions in the street,"" Jun said. ""I saw that they were taught how to steal, to kill also, and they have no respect anymore for the adults."" Pope Francis responded to Glyzelle's question and Jun's testimony by giving the two children a big hug. ""She is the only one who has put a question for which there is no answer and she wasn't even able to express it in words but in tears,"" the 78-year-old Pope told the crowd. Glyzelle and Jun are both in the care of Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation, a non-governmental organization that looks after Manila's street children. The foundation came across Glyzelle and her older sister a few years ago, said Alexandra Chapeleau, the group's communication manager. The girls had left home -- where their impoverished parents were unable to support them or get them an education -- and were fending for themselves on the street, she said. They first attended one of the foundation's drop-in centers before moving into a residential facility and starting to attend school. In November, their younger brother joined them at the foundation. Glyzelle is still in touch with her mother and goes home to see her at Christmas, Chapeleau said. The foundation's center where Glyzelle lives is home to about 40 other former street children. ""Most of them are victims of the terrible things that can happen in the street,"" including physical and sexual abuse, Chapeleau said. But Glyzelle's tears in front of the Pope on Sunday were apparently prompted by the intensity of the moment, not because of her own experiences. She asked the question ""on behalf of all the children we take care of,"" not because of ""something personal regarding her own story,"" Chapeleau said. The Pope touched on the street children theme again later Sunday when he celebrated Mass in a Manila park with millions of people, despite the soaking rain. ""We need to see each child as a gift to be welcomed, cherished and protected,"" he told the enormous crowd. ""And we need to care for our young, not allowing them to be condemned to a life on the streets."" The Pope had visited the center where Glyzelle and others live on Friday after celebrating Mass at Manila Cathedral, and reportedly said he was ""very moved"" by what he saw. There are estimated to be more than 1.5 million street children in the Philippines, about 70,000 of them in the Manila metropolitan area, according to the He Cares Foundation, another group that cares for them. In his account, Jun described seeing some of his friends sniffing glue and taking other drugs. He said he learned to be wary of adults offering money or help because it was often a trap to exploit the children. He initially declined an offer of support from Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation but later found out that the organization was genuinely trying to help him. ""I realized that not all people have no heart,"" he said. The Pope left the Philippines on Monday, waving as he boarded his plane at the end of an Asia trip that also included time in Sri Lanka. In the first visit by a Pope to the predominantly Catholic Philippines in 20 years, Francis paid a visit to Tacloban, the city ravaged by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013. Francis had to cut short his time there at the weekend because of the approach of another typhoon. But it didn't stop him from donning a slicker to celebrate Mass in Tacloban on Saturday for hundreds of thousands who gathered despite the stormy weather.","Glyzelle Palomar, 12, asks Pope why street children face drug abuse and prostitution .

"Over the last year, I have been working on a new documentary called ""Weed."" The title ""Weed"" may sound cavalier, but the content is not. I traveled around the world to interview medical leaders, experts, growers and patients. I spoke candidly to them, asking tough questions. What I found was stunning. Long before I began this project, I had steadily reviewed the scientific literature on medical marijuana from the United States and thought it was fairly unimpressive. Reading these papers five years ago, it was hard to make a case for medicinal marijuana. I even wrote about this in a TIME magazine article, back in 2009, titled ""Why I would Vote No on Pot."" Well, I am here to apologize. I apologize because I didn't look hard enough, until now. I didn't look far enough. I didn't review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research, and I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis. Instead, I lumped them with the high-visibility malingerers, just looking to get high. I mistakenly believed the Drug Enforcement Agency listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof.  Surely, they must have quality reasoning as to why marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs that have ""no accepted medicinal use and a high potential for abuse."" They didn't have the science to support that claim, and I now know that when it comes to marijuana neither of those things are true. It doesn't have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications. In fact, sometimes marijuana is the only thing that works. Take the case of Charlotte Figi, who I met in Colorado. She started having seizures soon after birth. By age 3, she was having 300 a week, despite being on seven different medications. Medical marijuana has calmed her brain, limiting her seizures to 2 or 3 per month. I have seen more patients like Charlotte first hand, spent time with them and come to the realization that it is irresponsible not to provide the best care we can as a medical community, care that could involve marijuana. We have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the United States, and I apologize for my own role in that. I hope this article and upcoming documentary will help set the record straight. On August 14, 1970, the Assistant Secretary of Health, Dr. Roger O. Egeberg wrote a letter recommending the plant, marijuana, be classified as a schedule 1 substance, and it has remained that way for nearly 45 years. My research started with a careful reading of that decades old letter. What I found was unsettling. Egeberg had carefully chosen his words: . ""Since there is still a considerable void in our knowledge of the plant and effects of the active drug contained in it, our recommendation is that marijuana be retained within schedule 1 at least until the completion of certain studies now underway to resolve the issue."" Not because of sound science, but because of its absence, marijuana was classified as a schedule 1 substance. Again, the year was 1970. Egeberg mentions studies that are underway, but many were never completed. As my investigation continued, however, I realized Egeberg did in fact have important research already available to him, some of it from more than 25 years earlier. High risk of abuse . In 1944, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia commissioned research to be performed by the New York Academy of Science. Among their conclusions: they found marijuana did not lead to significant addiction in the medical sense of the word. They also did not find any evidence marijuana led to morphine, heroin or cocaine addiction. We now know that while estimates vary, marijuana leads to dependence in around 9 to 10% of its adult users. By comparison, cocaine, a schedule 2 substance ""with less abuse potential than schedule 1 drugs"" hooks 20% of those who use it. Around 25% of heroin users become addicted. The worst is tobacco, where the number is closer to 30% of smokers, many of whom go on to die because of their addiction. There is clear evidence that in some people marijuana use can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including insomnia, anxiety and nausea. Even considering this, it is hard to make a case that it has a high potential for abuse. The physical symptoms of marijuana addiction are nothing like those of the other drugs I've mentioned. I have seen the withdrawal from alcohol, and it can be life threatening. I do want to mention a concern that I think about as a father. Young, developing brains are likely more susceptible to harm from marijuana than adult brains. Some recent studies suggest that regular use in teenage years leads to a permanent decrease in IQ. Other research hints at a possible heightened risk of developing psychosis. Much in the same way I wouldn't let my own children drink alcohol, I wouldn't permit marijuana until they are adults. If they are adamant about trying marijuana, I will urge them to wait until they're in their mid-20s when their brains are fully developed. Medical benefit . While investigating, I realized something else quite important. Medical marijuana is not new, and the medical community has been writing about it for a long time. There were in fact hundreds of journal articles, mostly documenting the benefits. Most of those papers, however, were written between the years 1840 and 1930. The papers described the use of medical marijuana to treat ""neuralgia, convulsive disorders, emaciation,"" among other things. A search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine this past year pulled up nearly 2,000 more recent papers. But the majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as ""Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis,"" or ""Cannabis induced pancreatitits"" and ""Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer."" In my quick running of the numbers, I calculated about 6% of the current U.S. marijuana studies investigate the benefits of medical marijuana. The rest are designed to investigate harm. That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture. The challenges of marijuana research . To do studies on marijuana in the United States today, you need two important things. First of all, you need marijuana. And marijuana is illegal. You see the problem. Scientists can get research marijuana from a special farm in Mississippi, which is astonishingly located in the middle of the Ole Miss campus, but it is challenging. When I visited this year, there was no marijuana being grown. The second thing you need is approval, and the scientists I interviewed kept reminding me how tedious that can be. While a cancer study may first be evaluated by the National Cancer Institute, or a pain study may go through the National Institute for Neurological Disorders, there is one more approval required for marijuana: NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It is an organization that has a core mission of studying drug abuse, as opposed to benefit. Stuck in the middle are the legitimate patients who depend on marijuana as a medicine, oftentimes as their only good option. Keep in mind that up until 1943, marijuana was part of the United States drug pharmacopeia. One of the conditions for which it was prescribed was neuropathic pain. It is a miserable pain that's tough to treat. My own patients have described it as ""lancinating, burning and a barrage of pins and needles."" While marijuana has long been documented to be effective for this awful pain, the most common medications prescribed today come from the poppy plant, including morphine, oxycodone and dilaudid. Here is the problem. Most of these medications don't work very well for this kind of pain, and tolerance is a real problem. Most frightening to me is that someone dies in the United States every 19 minutes from a prescription drug overdose, mostly accidental. Every 19 minutes. It is a horrifying statistic. As much as I searched, I could not find a documented case of death from marijuana overdose. It is perhaps no surprise then that 76% of physicians recently surveyed said they would approve the use of marijuana to help ease a woman's pain from breast cancer. When marijuana became a schedule 1 substance, there was a request to fill a ""void in our knowledge."" In the United States, that has been challenging because of the infrastructure surrounding the study of an illegal substance, with a drug abuse organization at the heart of the approval process. And yet, despite the hurdles, we have made considerable progress that continues today. Looking forward, I am especially intrigued by studies like those in Spain and Israel looking at the anti-cancer effects of marijuana and its components. I'm intrigued by the neuro-protective study by Raphael Meschoulam in Israel, and research in Israel and the United States on whether the drug might help alleviate symptoms of PTSD. I promise to do my part to help, genuinely and honestly, fill the remaining void in our knowledge. Citizens in 20 states and the District of Columbia have now voted to approve marijuana for medical applications, and more states will be making that choice soon. As for Dr. Roger Egeberg, who wrote that letter in 1970, he passed away 16 years ago. I wonder what he would think if he were alive today.","Dr. Sanjay Gupta says we have been ""systematically misled"" on marijuana .

"Mantecore, the white tiger whose co-starring role in Siegfried and Roy's illusion-packed Las Vegas act was overshadowed by one visceral act of violence, has died. The big cat was 17. Mantecore died March 19, wrote Siegfried Fischbacher on the duo's Facebook page Tuesday. The tiger had been living at the Siegfried & Roy Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat at the Mirage hotel. Mantecore was a part of the long-running ""Siegfried & Roy"" show when it lunged at Roy Horn's neck halfway through a sold-out performance in October 2003. ""He (Horn) looked like a rag doll in his mouth,"" an audience member told CNN at the time. Trainers quickly rushed the stage to subdue the tiger. It  was Horn's 59th birthday. By the time emergency officials arrived, Horn had suffered massive blood loss and was in critical condition. He also suffered a stroke and required two surgeries. Four days after the attack, Fischbacher defended the tiger on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""Listen, I say it was an accident,"" he said, adding that if Mantecore wanted to kill his partner ""it would (have happened) in no time."" Siegfried also said that Mantecore biting Horn's neck was similar to what a mother cat does with her cubs. Horn did survive the attack, but was left partially paralyzed. He never returned to the stage and makes only rare public appearances. The show, too, was canceled. In his post about Mantecore, Fischbacher wrote about the closeness he felt with the tiger. Mantecore was one of three cubs. The cub's mother neglected it. So Fischbacher once had to go into the tiger's den and give it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The young cub was then cared for by Fischbacher's mother, who bottle-fed it every three hours. ""Farewell my dear friend,"" Fischbacher wrote. ""Know that your image is forever burned into my heart.""","Mantecore attacked Roy during a sold-out performance in 2003 .

"Justin Bieber's capuchin monkey -- famously seized by German customs officials after the singer brought it on tour without the right paperwork -- is now out of quarantine and about to join a new ""family"" in a German zoo. The young monkey, Mally, was taken to a Munich animal shelter after he was confiscated at the end of March as Bieber arrived in Germany on tour. But the capuchin has now been transferred to the Serengeti Park in Hodenhagen, near Hanover in northern Germany, to start life with his new family -- six other capuchin monkeys. Mally was transferred Wednesday to the zoo's new monkey area, consisting of a tree-covered island -- dubbed ""Mally-bu"" -- surrounded by a moat and equipped with a house for its seven residents. He's the first to arrive on the island and the others will be introduced gradually, if all goes according to plan, zoo spokeswoman Juliane Gunkel told CNN. The other capuchins are three males and three females, one of whom was born around the same time as Mally and is known as Molly, Gunkel said. Justin Bieber in accident involving pedestrian . While in quarantine, for several weeks at the animal shelter and another month at the zoo, the monkey clung to a stuffed toy thought to have been given to him by Bieber. But the zoo is confident he'll adjust to his new life quickly, Gunkel said. ""He is very clever and he's the right age, not too old"" to fit in, she said. Bieber had until May 7 to present the right paperwork to reclaim his pet -- who's now 27 weeks old and weighs a little less than three pounds -- but failed to do so, Gunkel said. As a result, Mally is now the property of the German government, and the Serengeti Park is acting as a caretaker for the creature. The park was picked because it was the only zoo in Germany that had a family of capuchins for Mally to join. Bieber had better slow down, neighbors say . The zoo contacted the pop star's management to tell it about Mally's new home but did not receive a response, Gunkel said. She doesn't anticipate a visit from the pop star to the zoo. So far Bieber's fans, known for their devotion to the 19-year-old singer, have not been rushing to the Serengeti Park, but some questions have been posted on Facebook and the zoo's website, she added. Bieber's representatives declined to comment at the time the animal was confiscated. Karl Heinz Joachim of the animal shelter told CNN in April that the monkey was ""not distressed"" but was too young to have been taken from his mother.

"FIFA pledged Friday to reform its governance structure after the corruption scandals which rocked football's world governing body last year. Proposed changes to its ethics committee, which will be split into two entities, one to investigate allegations and another to rule on them, were hailed as ""historic"" by FIFA president Sepp Blatter after being approved by the executive committee. They will still need to be endorsed by FIFA's 2012 Congress in Budapest, Hungary in May. FIFA was responding to a report of the Independent Governance Committee (IGC), chaired by Swiss professor Mark Pieth and made public Friday. It was commissioned after Asian football chief Mohamed bin Hammam was banned from the game for life after being found guilty of corruption for trying to buy votes in the FIFA presidential election with $40,000 cash inducements to Caribbean football officials. The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, respectively won by Russia and Qatar, also came under scrutiny after allegations of improper conduct. Pieth and the eight-strong ICG group branded as ""unsatisfactory"" FIFA's past handling  of the corruption allegations. ""Existing procedures are insufficient to meet the challenges of a major global sport governing body,"" the ICG found. It went on ""This has led to unsatisfactory reactions to persistent allegations. ""In some instances, allegations were insufficiently investigated and where sanctions were imposed, they are at times insufficient and clearly unconvincing."" Blatter told a press conference in Zurich Friday that his organization recognized the need for change. ""The executive committee unanimously agreed to this new approach in our efforts for more transparency and integrity,"" he said. ""The new ethics committee will have the possibility to initiate investigation in the case of credible allegations."" But Grant Wahl, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated, who unsuccessfully tried to challenge Blatter in the FIFA presidential elections last year, told CNN that while the 76-year-old Swiss remained at the helm there would be doubts about the implementation of the proposed changes. ""Sepp Blatter came to power 14 years ago through an election where he had the support of executive members who are now disgraced so he has very little credibility in preaching for reform,"" he said. Wahl was also disappointed that the ICG had stopped short of calling for further investigation into the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup host countries. ""My big concern is that there is no recommendation to do a forensic investigation into 2018 and 2022 bidding process because it was clearly not satisfactory in many people's eyes,"" he said. Wahl also doubted FIFA would implement the ICG recommendation to limit the terms of FIFA president and executive committee members to two terms of four years. ""Term limits are a really important change, it would keep some of these dinosaurs from sitting on the committee for years and years,"" he said. FIFA also agreed Friday to co-opt its entire executive committee onto the organizing body of the 2014 World Cup after concerns that preparations in Brazil have fallen behind schedule. 2010 World Cup chief South African Danny Jordaan has also been named as an adviser along with Alexei Sorokin, who is overseeing the 2018 tournament in Russia. A FIFA statement said: ""To underline the significance of the FIFA World Cup for world football's governing body, the complete FIFA executive committee is now, for the first time, part of this decision-making forum which is responsible for monitoring and organizing each edition of FIFA's flagship event.""","FIFA proposes changes to its ethics committee after 2011 corruption scandals .

"(CNN)Several terror attacks. Deadly counterterrorism raids. And a wave of suspected jihadist arrests from France to Greece to Belgium. European Union officials are scrambling to stop the spread of terrorism and threats, with foreign ministers meeting Monday in Brussels, Belgium, to tackle the issue. ""We start with obviously a discussion on how to counter terrorism, not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world,"" said Federica Mogherini, EU high representative for foreign affairs. She said she had just met with Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby ""as the threat is not only the one we faced in Paris, but also spreading in many other parts of the world starting from Muslim countries. ""And we need to strengthen our way of cooperating together, first of all with Arab countries, and then internally."" With new developments sprouting up across Europe, here are the latest: . • The hunt is still on for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in raids last week, Belgium's justice minister said. The suspected leader and key link between senior ISIS operatives in Syria and the Belgian terrorist cell, Belgian-Moroccan ISIS fighter Abelhamid Abaaoud, is still at large, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official said. Abaaoud's last known location was believed to be Greece, the official said. • An Algerian national who may have links to Abaaoud was arrested over the weekend in Greece and is being extradited to Belgium. • The man detained by Belgian police after last week's raid has been identified. His attorney says he isn't a terrorist; he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. But investigators believe the man played a key role in the terrorist cell's plot, the Belgian counterterrorism official said. • Investigators are looking for a man whose DNA was found on a gun magazine used by Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four hostages at a kosher supermarket in Paris. • Sales of counterfeit goods by Charlie Hebdo attacker Cherif Kouachi helped fund the purchase of weapons, a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in France told CNN. Five Belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week's raid in Verviers, federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said. The terror cell planned to target police officers, he said. Belgian counterterrorism agencies think the suspected ringleader of the cell is likely Abaaoud, the senior Belgian counterterrorism official said. According to Guy Van Vlierden, a reporter at the Belgian newspaper HLN who tracks Belgian foreign fighters in Syria for the blog ""emmejihad,"" Abaaoud is a 27-year-old from the Molenbeek district of Brussels who traveled to Syria in January 2014 and joined ISIS soon afterward. The two gunmen killed in the Verviers raid, Belgians of North African descent from the same Brussels district, were in phone contact with an ISIS ringleader in Greece, who Belgian authorities believe was likely Abaaoud. But Belgian authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an Algerian suspect arrested in Greece over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and ISIS. That 33-year-old suspect was wanted in Belgium on charges of terrorist activity, Greek police said Monday. Belgium is requesting an extradition. And Greece isn't done yet; police there say they have made multiple arrests and are looking for more suspects. Other countries are also helping Belgium nab suspected jihadists. French authorities captured two suspects as they were trying to cross from France into Italy, Van Der Sypt said. Four days after police raided a suspected terror cell in Verviers, Belgium, killing two people who authorities said were part of a terrorist cell on the brink of a major attack, we now know the name of the surviving suspect. Marouane El Bali was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack, among other charges, said his attorney, Didier De Quévy. But De Quévy said his client was not involved in any terrorism. ""He went to Verviers to see his fiancée and was dropping off a pair of sneakers,""  De Quévy said. ""He did not know that these guys were connected to international terrorism. He arrived, he sat down and, the moment he sat down, the policemen starting shooting. He managed to escape by jumping out the window. The other two, however, took their guns and responded and got killed."" Authorities say it wasn't just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Investigators believe El Bali played a key role in the terrorist cell's plot and was a key intermediary between two dead gunmen and a wider network in Brussels, the senior Belgian counterterrorism official said. El Bali is also believed to have fought with ISIS in Syria at some point. There are still concerns that part of the terror cell remains  at large in Belgium, and could take revenge for the death of their comrades, the senior counterterrorism official said. Belgian security services suspect around 10 people were involved in the cell, but they don't know the number for sure and that worries them. Belgian counterterrorism officials believe the cell had ambitious attack plans beyond attacking police, given bomb-making chemicals found in their safe house in Verviers and police uniforms. They also suspect terrorists were plotting multiple attacks. The belief is that the cell has now been disrupted and will take some time to get back on its feet. The wider cell was being monitored for less than two months. Over the last several weeks, Belgian security services started monitoring the Verviers group 24/7. Why did police move in last week? One reason, the official said, is that the cell obtained weapons and Belgian police could not continue round-the-clock surveillance indefinitely. Investigators say DNA found in a car used to transport Jewish market attack gunman Coulibaly has been traced to a man who is already in custody in connection with the attacks, according to a source familiar with the ongoing investigation. Investigators are still looking for a person whose DNA was found on a magazine for Coulibaly's gun. Coulibaly is the gunman who killed four hostages on January 9 at a kosher grocery store in Paris before police killed him. Before the siege, he had proclaimed his allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The assault happened during three days of terror in France that began with the attack on offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper in Paris. In all, 12 people died in the Charlie Hebdo attack on January 7. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shootings. On Monday, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Laurent Sourisseau will succeed editor Stephane Charbonnier, who died in the attack. Although French officials said they thought Cherif Kouachi had given up terror-related activities and moved to end surveillance on him after he began selling counterfeit goods, it turns out the proceeds from those sales were being used to buy weapons, a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in France told CNN. That's just one of several missteps by intelligence agencies in France being revealed by the investigation into the attacks, the source said. Other failings include a lack of communication and delays in circulating information, according to the source. In one case, a French surveillance agency received an alert about one of the Kouachi brothers' phones in February 2014, but it took four months for information to be passed on to the country's main domestic spy agency, the source said. By then, neither brother was under surveillance, the source said. The surveillance on Cherif Kouachi ended in November 2013; the surveillance on Said Kouachi, the older brother, ended in June, sources have told CNN. Also, authorities now say they think both Said and Cherif Kouachi traveled to Yemen in 2011 via Oman, even though Cherif's passport had been confiscated in 2010. However, investigators have been unable to find either brother's name in travel databases, according to the source. CNN's Phil Black, Ivan Watson and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Official: The suspected ringleader behind the Belgian terror cell remains at large .

"NEW YORK (Reuters)  -- PepsiCo Inc. will spell out that its Aquafina bottled water is made with tap water, a concession to the growing environmental and political opposition to the bottled water industry. According to Corporate Accountability International, a U.S. watchdog group, the world's No. 2 beverage company will include the words ""Public Water Source"" on Aquafina labels. Pepsi's Aquafina bottled water and Coca-Cola's Dasani are made from purified tap water. ""If this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources, then it's a reasonable thing to do,"" said Michelle Naughton, a Pepsi-Cola North America spokeswoman. Pepsi Chief Executive Indra Nooyi told Reuters earlier this week the company was considering such a move. Pepsi's Aquafina and Coca-Cola Co's Dasani are both made from purified water sourced from public reservoirs, as opposed to Danone's Evian or Nestle's Poland Spring, so-called ""spring waters,"" shipped from specific locations the companies say have notably clean water. Coca-Cola Co. told Reuters it will start posting online information about the quality control testing it performs on Dasani by the end of summer or early fall. ""Concerns about the bottled-water industry, and increasing corporate control of water, are growing across the country,"" said Gigi Kellett, director of the ""Think Outside the Bottle"" campaign, which aims to encourage people to drink tap water. San Francisco's mayor banned city employees from using city funds to buy bottled water when tap water is available. Ann Arbor, Michigan passed a resolution banning commercially bottled water at city events and Salt Lake City, Utah asked department heads to eliminate bottled water. Critics charge the bottled water industry adds plastic to landfills, uses too much energy by producing and shipping bottles across the world and undermines confidence in the safety and cleanliness of public water supplies, all while much of the world's population is without access to clean water. But industry observers said such opposition is unlikely to drain U.S. sales of bottled water, which reached 2.6 billion cases in 2006, according to Beverage Digest. The industry newsletter estimated that U.S. consumers spent about $15 billion on bottled water last year. ""Consumers have an affection for bottled water. It's not an issue of taste or health, it's about convenience,"" the newsletter's publisher, John Sicher, said. ""Try walking up (New York City's) Third Avenue on a hot day and getting a glass of tap water."" Dave Kolpak, a portfolio manager at Victory Capital Management, said the environmental objections will have little impact on the bottom line for either Pepsi or Coke, though he admitted it could slow the market's growth rate. ""Pepsi and Coke do not make a lot of profit"" on bottled water, said Kolpak, adding that people may talk about the issue, but will likely continue buying some bottled water. Victory Capital owns about 3 million shares of PepsiCo among its $62 billion under management. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- Is there any way to ... well ... defend Roger Goodell? Well, yes. When everyone is piling on, it's time to take a breath and say: We need more facts, less reliance on media reports based on anonymous sources and over-heated pundits who are too ready to rush to judgment. As I said on CNN's Michael Smerconish show on Saturday morning, of course Commissioner Goodell made a huge mistake in his decision to give Ravens running back Ray Rice only a two-game suspension after seeing the videotape of Rice dragging his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, unconscious, with apparent indifference, out of an Atlantic City casino elevator on February 15. Opinion: Why Goodell must go . The public uproar that followed the announcement of Rice's suspension took time, too much time, to register with Goodell. A month later Goodell realized he had made a terrible mistake, sending a wrong message that domestic violence by NFL players was not all that serious and, thus, putting his own professional reputation and the NFL brand at risk. But then he turned in the right direction, following the three basic rules of crisis management, whether in business, politics, or life. First, he acknowledged that he made a mistake and took personal responsibility. He showed that he understood, albeit belatedly, how serious male violence against women is. In his August 28 letter to all NFL owners, Goodell wrote: ""I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better."" In an accompanying memorandum that would be distributed to all personnel in the NFL, he wrote, in bold-faced dark letters, the following: . ""Domestic violence and sexual assault are wrong. They are illegal. They are never acceptable and have no place in the NFL under any circumstances."" Voices of domestic violence . Second, he laid out a detailed forward-looking mandatory education and training program to implement this policy. Most important, he announced far more severe penalties than before, effective immediately for violations of this bold-faced policy: 1) at least six game suspensions for the first violation, with heavier penalties if facts show more serious offenses, such as violence involving a weapon, choking, repeated striking, against a pregnant woman or in the presence of a child; and 2) a second offense will result in ""banishment"" from the NFL. That's right, banishment -- with no assumption that a petition for reinstatement will ever be accepted. The third rule is to authorize an independent investigation to answer all the questions and verify the facts. And that is exactly what happened. Of course the emphasis is on the word ""independent."" Two owners, John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney II of the Pittsburgh Steelers, both of whom are attorneys, appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller III to conduct the investigation of how Goodell and the NFL headquarters handled the Rice matter. In their public statement, Mara and Rooney asked Mueller to address specific questions raised in the media, such as ""what efforts were made by league staff to obtain the video of what took place inside the elevator and to determine whether, in fact, the video was ever delivered to someone at the league office and if so what happened to the video after it was delivered."" Mara and Rooney publicly guaranteed that Mueller will have full access to all information and all individuals. They have committed in advance to make the report public. It is safe to assume that anyone who refuses to cooperate with Mueller will be out. I have read about doubts about Mueller's objectivity because he comes from a large law firm that has ties to the NFL. My response: Nonsense. Robert Mueller is a former United States attorney, senior U.S. Justice Department official, and one of the most respected FBI directors in history. Opinion: Curb Goodell's power over discipline . Washington is a tough town. I don't know of a single person in DC who knows Mueller who doesn't regard him as ""untouchable"" -- a modern-day Eliot Ness, tough with the highest level of integrity. If Mueller finds that Roger Goodell lied about not seeing the second videotape or about what he was told by Ray Rice on July 16 when they met behind closed doors, Goodell will no longer be NFL commissioner. And Goodell knows that. So while Commissioner Goodell made some serious mistakes and dug himself and the NFL into a deep hole, he did a pretty good job of crisis management, especially conveying once and for all how seriously the NFL views domestic violence. Now after all the media and pundit frenzy, it is up to all of us to take a breath and wait for Mr. Mueller to complete his work -- and to let proven, verified facts speak louder and more persuasively than innuendo and anonymous sources. If only we could do that. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Ray Rice's football position. He is a running back.

"Anti-marijuana crusaders like Kevin Sabet, while well-intentioned, are promoting policies that lead to more violence and disease in our society. In his recent CNN.com op-ed, Sabet argues we should keep marijuana illegal. But as long as marijuana remains illegal, profits from sales go to criminals and drug cartels, and adults will continue to be punished for using a substance less harmful than currently legal drugs. Confused? Let's back up. For more than 80 years, our government has spent tens of billions of taxpayer dollars fighting a war against marijuana. We arrest three-quarters of a million  adults every year, 87% for simple possession rather than production or sales of marijuana. Courtrooms turn into assembly lines churning out probationers -- mostly minorities -- with convictions that will make it virtually impossible to find employment. The result? Marijuana is universally available, used by almost half of Americans at some point in their lives, and we've enriched murderous drug cartels fueling violence in Mexico that has claimed more than 60,000 lives. Of course, we've been down this road before. During alcohol prohibition in the 1930s, federal agents raided speakeasies and busted barrels of illegally produced and imported booze. Meanwhile, bootleggers made money hand over fist, empowering criminals like Al Capone to turn Chicago into an urban war zone. And much like with marijuana today, even under alcohol prohibition most Americans who wanted a drink had no problem finding one. Today, marijuana prohibition has proven itself just as disastrous a public policy failure as alcohol prohibition before it. Yet despite all the obvious similarities between the two, there's one key difference: Marijuana is dramatically safer than alcohol. According to the Centers for Disease Control, excessive alcohol use is the third leading lifestyle-related cause of death. In a typical year, there are roughly 25,000 alcohol-induced deaths in the United States, most from long-term consequences like liver disease and some from acute alcohol poisoning brought on by binge drinking. Marijuana, on the other hand, does not cause overdose deaths and comes with far fewer long-term health consequences. A 2009 Canadian study determined the annual health-related costs associated with alcohol are more than eight times greater per user than with marijuana. And, according to the Institute of Medicine, people who use marijuana are far less likely to become dependent than those who drink alcohol. Even if you don't drink, alcohol can kill you. Federal agencies report that 40% of violent crimes in the U.S. are linked to alcohol use,  whereas those same agencies report that marijuana users usually do not commit violent crimes. Alcohol plays a role in a third of all emergency room visits. As a prosecuting attorney, I often had police confess to me how much they loathed arresting drunks, given how often the situation escalated to violence. I never fielded similar complaints about marijuana consumers. The irony is that these perverse policies are cheered on by organizations with names like ""Save Our Society"" that seem to believe chaos will somehow ensue if adults are no longer punished for using marijuana. The reality is that by punishing adults who would rather use marijuana, we're encouraging them to instead use alcohol -- a more dangerous and harmful, but legal, drug. Public policy should be geared toward reducing violence and disease, not maximizing them. There is a better way. Polling shows a majority of Americans want marijuana taxed and regulated. A growing number of states are bucking our federal government's policy of absolute marijuana prohibition, and the Department of Justice recently signaled it will not challenge state laws that regulate the cultivation and sale of marijuana. By doing so, we can take marijuana away from criminals and cartels and put it in the hands of licensed businesses. Obviously, those businesses should be subject to sensible rules ranging from where and when they can operate and who is able to invest in them, to restrictions on advertising. Don't believe it could work? In 2009, Colorado's medical marijuana industry exploded, prompting the state to put in place the kinds of regulations I've just outlined. According to CDC data on youth drug use, from 2009 to 2011 -- a time when youth marijuana use increased nationally -- the percentage of Colorado teens using marijuana dropped more than any other state in the country and is now below the national average. Marijuana is safer than alcohol; let's treat it that way. Adults who would prefer to use marijuana instead of alcohol should be free to do so. Just as significant, the law enforcement resources spent making those three-quarters of a million arrests could instead be devoted to preventing and solving real crimes. In other words, regulating marijuana would make America a safer, healthier nation.","Dan Riffle: The war against marijuana has not worked, just like alcohol prohibition .

"A high profile member of FIFA's executive committee, has been provisionally banned from ""football related activity"" for 90 days, the world governing body said Monday. Sri Lankan Vernon Fernando Manilal has been suspended at the request of the Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert, who chair the investigatory and adjudicatory bodies of FIFA's Ethics Committee. No details of his alleged trangression were released,  but FIFA said the decision was based on an article in its Code of Ethics, ""in order to prevent the interference with the establishment of the truth with respect to proceedings now in the adjudicatory chamber."" The 63-year-old Manilal, who is a lawyer and businessman by profession, has represented the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on the influential executive committee since 2011. Manilal's eventual fate now rests with the Eckert's adjudicatory body, but he will be barred from attending the next executive meeting in Zurich later this month when further anti-corruption measures are expected to be announced. FIFA strengthened its ethics code after the suspension of former AFC chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, who challenged Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency and was also a member of the executive commitee. Manilal accompanied Qatari Bin Hammam on a trip to the Caribbean ahead of that election in June 2011. It was alleged bin Hamman offered officials, including former North American football chief Jack Warner, cash for votes, at a meeting in Trinidad. There is no suggestion Manilal was involved, but Bin Hammam withdrew 24 hours before the presidential election ballot after being provisionally suspended by FIFA. Manilal's ban means he cannot take play any part in the behind the scenes activity ahead of the AFC presidential elections in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia on May 2. The AFC will be appointing a permanent successor to Bin Hammam and hoping to put a difficult period of governance behind them. Manilal, who is chairman of FIFA's Futsal Committee, launched the 2012 World Cup in that mini version of football in Thailand last December. He lists meeting Brazilian legend Pele and being elected to FIFA as his ""fondest football memory"" and is also a supporter of English Premier League giants Liverpool.","FIFA executive committee member banned for alleged breach of its ethics code .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Russian company is seeking to buy a controlling interest in one of the largest uranium extraction operations in the United States -- a sale that requires U.S. government review because of possible national security implications. Uranium One USA, now a subsidiary of a Canadian company, operates a uranium processing facility in Wyoming and has assets in Utah, Texas and Colorado. The sale of the company's existing and pending operations could give Russia control of about 20 percent of U.S. uranium extraction capacity, Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials estimate. Industry observers tell CNN they do not believe the sale of Uranium One to Joint Stock Company Atomredmetzoloto, or ARMZ, would jeopardize U.S. security, saying that the United States relies on Russian dismantled nuclear weapons for much of the uranium used in nuclear reactors today, and that sources of uranium are plentiful. ""I have no concerns about it at all,"" said Fred McGoldrick, former director of the State Department's Office of Nonproliferation and Export Policy. ""I don't see any national security threat to the United States from the Russians partly or entirely owning a mine in the United States."" He added, ""The Russian's aren't coming. They came and went. They are no longer the Soviets. I think it's to our mutual interest that we cooperate with the Russians."" Said Ed Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists, ""Looking at the big picture here, I don't really think this has major security implications. I'd be interested in hearing arguments otherwise, but I just don't see it."" In an application submitted to the NRC, JSC Atomredmetzoloto, which currently owns 23.1 percent of Uranium One's common stock, says it is seeking to buy a controlling 51 percent interest. The Russian company is controlled by Rosatom, the Russian government agency that oversees Russia's nuclear industry. Uranium One would continue to be publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, its U.S. facilities would remain under their current management teams and five of the nine directors on the company's board would be non-Russian, the company said. ""The bottom line is any of the uranium we buy or sell has to be used for peaceful purposes and it's subject to all the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community), or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction over the United States"" and customer countries, said Chris Sattler, spokesman for Uranium One. Uranium One USA is involved in the ""recovery"" of uranium, a form of mining in which a solution is injected into an ore body and the uranium leaches into the solution, which is then extracted, said NRC spokesman David McIntyre. The company is licensed to produce up to 2.5 million pounds of uranium a year, it said. Stockholders approved the sale August 31, Sattler said, but the companies are awaiting approval from numerous regulatory agencies in the United States, Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. The NRC must approve the transfer of the NRC license for its Irigaray-Christiansen Ranch recovery facility in eastern Wyoming, McIntyre said. ""Generally, we look at whether the new ownership would have the technical expertise and the financial wherewithal to maintain the site and clean up when operations cease,"" he said. Further, the sale needs to be reviewed by the Committee on Financial Investment in the United States, an inter-agency panel that advises the president on any transaction that could jeopardize U.S. national security. Committee officials declined to discuss the sale, saying they are prohibited by law from disclosing such matters. And the sale may require approval of the Federal Trade Commission because it involves a stock transaction, and the Federal Communications Commission because one of the sites has a radio license, the NRC said. The NRC released details of a pending license transfer in the Federal Register, in an item giving the public an opportunity to request a hearing on the issue. The NRC involvement is limited to the company's operations in Wyoming. The states of Texas and Utah regulate uranium mining operations there.","The company is one of the largest uranium extraction operations in the U.S.

"(CNN)Ferry van Tongeren believes that there are two types of people in the world: those who like dead animals, and those who don't. Being a professional fine-art taxidermist, it's obvious what category he places himself. ""I know it's hard to believe, but the presence of death has nothing to do with it for me,"" says the Dutch artist. ""It's about shapes, color and construction, not death. But if you think it's gross, I can't even start to explain the beauty to you."" Then, after a moment of reflection, he adds: ""I'm not weird."" As part of the Darwin-Sinke-van-Tongeren collective -- which makes the unusual move of including Charles Darwin as a member -- van Tongeren and his artistic partner, Jaap Sinke, create extraordinary taxidermy artworks that have been and acclaimed all over the world. The pieces are inspired by the paintings of 17th Century painters like Jan Weenix, Melchior d'Hondecoeter and Adriaen van Olen, and have been called ""flamboyant 17th century luxury"" The blend of retro-cool and exquisite workmanship led one reviewer to say that it ""elevates taxidermy to a higher plane"". There is no doubt: van Tongeren and Sinke -- who sport wild hair and beards and wear matching leather aprons -- are the hottest thing to happen to taxidermy in decades. Demand is growing for their work, with pieces selling for between £2,000 and £25,000. n 25 November, their latest exhibition will be coming to the Shapero Rare Book store in London. Late starter . Given these achievements, many find it hard to believe that van Tongeren has only been in the game for three years. ""I was 47 years old, and was running my own advertising agency,"" he recalls. ""We were on a family holiday in New Zealand, and over dinner I just said to my wife, 'I know what I want to do. I want to be a taxidermist'. ""It had never occurred to me before that day, and it changed my life overnight."" His wife ""has accepted it"", and his two children, he says, ""love it"". His 15-year-old son helps with the stuffing, and his six-year-old daughter likes it too -- though ""she gets a bit worried when I start stroking the cat."" (Van Tongeren has a cat and a dog, which he has no intention of stuffing. For now.) Part of the secret to the duo's success is the quality that is evident from their work. In some quarters taxidermy has become quite trendy over recent years, but it's rare to find stuffed animals that can genuinely be mistaken for living creatures. ""We use the old-fashioned, Victorian methods,"" he explains. ""In those days, labor was not so expensive so they took their time over everything. But now mass production has taken over, so speed has taken over. ""Most modern taxidermists buy a ready-made mannequin and stretch the skin over the top. ""But we take months over each animal. We do it as it should be done, and the results speak for themselves. It takes months rather than hours."" The beauty of death . Among the works of art van Tangeren and Sinke have produced are a beautiful flamingo with raised wings; a parrot with its feathers spread into an artistic action pose; a monkey with its tail raised in a flamboyant circle; and a red-billed, blue magpie, wings and tail stretched back as if in some magical flight. ""I love birds,"" says van Tangeren. ""We have a network of breeders and zoos who give us a call when a rare animal dies. ""As an artist, it's a big advantage to start with something beautiful in itself. You can't use paint to make colors like some birds have. The intensity of the colors and the layers of their feathers is breathtaking."" In retrospect, van Tangeren's sudden epiphany three years ago was not such a surprise. Since he was a child, he says, he was fascinated by dead animals, and has been collecting skulls all his life. (The centerpiece of his collection is the skull of a duck-billed platypus.) ""In a way, it's about owning something beautiful,"" he says. ""As a child you don't really own anything, but when you find a skull, you have a feeling that this is something worth a lot. ""That is the feeling that has stayed with me. I know it's hard to believe, but it's about capturing and holding beauty, not death.""

"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's timing was impeccable: July 1 marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF), the de-fanged fighting force that has protected the country since its creation from the ashes of post-World War II Japan. Following the announcement, it is also the day that, some would argue, the name ceased to have any meaning. Abe's government, mindful of looming regional security threats to Japan and its neighbors, has allowed the ""reinterpretation"" of the country's pacifist postwar constitution to reflect what he sees as necessary pivots to meet the 21st century security challenges that the nation faces. Abe's Cabinet has approved a defense policy that takes a liberal view of the constitution, allowing for Japanese involvement in the defense of its allies. Previously, the SDF could only act if Japan itself was directly threatened. Abe, speaking at a press conference Tuesday. said that the ""basic idea"" of the constitution ""remains unchanged,"" and that any involvement in military action must be taken in a ""minimal way."" He said that Japan's security policy has evolved throughout the postwar period, and that the SDF activities in peacekeeping missions are appreciated around the world. With the reinterpretation, ""Japan will contribute even more than in the past."" With regional concerns, such as North Korea's missile program and China's increasing belligerence in regional territorial claims occupying the Prime Minister's mind, he will see a more relaxed interpretation of the document as critical to maintaining Japan's influence, both within the East Asian sphere but also internationally. ""Our peace is not something given by others,"" Abe said. ""We ourselves must establish peace. There is no other way."" The move paves the way for Japan to send SDF troops, ships and aircraft to support U.S. military activities in conflict areas and to join internationally sanctioned security activities, putting Japan in line with many of its key allies, including the U.S., which has long supported this. The United States ""welcomed"" the reinterpretation, State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf said. ""The U.S.-Japan alliance is one of our most important partnerships, security partnerships, and we value efforts by Japan to strengthen that security cooperation, and also value Japan's efforts to maintain openness and transparency throughout this decision-making process that's led up to this new policy."" Abe's proposal will end the ban on ""collective self defense"" and make it easier for Japanese troops to be deployed overseas to aid in the protection of allies. Before Abe's statement, the constitution's famed Article 9 expressly disallowed military solutions as a defining principle. ""The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes,"" an excerpt reads. Until today, the interpretation was that Japan can use its military force only to protect itself from external attack. Since its inclusion in the constitution in 1946, no Japanese military personnel have been engaged in combat overseas, although troops have been sent to countries like Iraq for peacekeeping and reconstruction purposes. And many in Japan are unwilling to see the hallowed article go without a fight. Before the announcement, thousands of protesters thronged the pavement outside the Prime Minister's office and official residence, demanding that Abe step back from the decision to reinterpret the constitution. Over the weekend one man set himself on fire outside the busy, city center Shinjuku station in apparent protest. Polls are divided over the move, which was hastily -- and some say incompletely -- debated. But one thing is not in doubt; that there remain swathes of the Japanese public who oppose this move. Yoshihide Suga, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, said the coalition is ""confident that a majority of the public support the use of the right of collective defense in limited condition."" ""In reality we need to set up legal framework (to exercise the collective defense) and we need to debate in the Diet. I believe we can earn the understanding of the public."" Japan's relationship with its neighbors, particularly key trading partners South Korea and China, has never been hugely cordial, but is currently at a particularly low ebb. Abe's visit to the Yasukuni shirine, which honors Japan's war dead -- including war criminals -- and the ongoing debate over responsibility for comfort women, means that for the Prime Minister to show his hawkish side may risk even further deterioration of East Asian relations. The Chinese government bristled at the implication that it was China's expansionism that was motivating Abe's move to a more reactive stance. ""We are opposed to Japan's pursuit of its domestic political goal by deliberately making up the so-called 'China threat,'"" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hong Lai said ahead of Abe's announcement. He also noted that the government were pursuing the change in interpretation despite widespread public opposition. ""It is the general public of Japan that should have the final say on which way Japan should follow in terms of national development."" China's state-run People's Daily also warned of the pitfalls of trashing the pacifist wording of the document, saying that the move essentially amounts to an ""upgrade"" of Japan's SDF to ""a national military ... brutally violating the spirit of Japan's current (pacifist) constitution."" South Korea warned Japan off operating without the Republic's consent in matters that directly affect the country's soverignty, and said that it would ""continue to keep a close eye on relevant developments,"" according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs  spokesperson. The MoFA official also used the occasion to emphasize the impact of Japan's wartime actions and successive governments' denial of responsibility on regional harmony. ""In terms of defense and security issues, the Japanese government should renounce historical revisionism and take right actions in order to dispel doubts and concerns stemming from historical issues and to win the trust from its neighboring countries.""","Japan's Prime Minister confirms a more liberal interpretation of the country's constitution .
Re-reading of postwar document will free up Japanese military to assist in conflicts overseas .
Opposition to the move runs high, although opinion is divided .

"Sittwe, Myanmar (CNN)Everyone you talk to from this country's Rohingya minority knows someone who attempted the dangerous and illegal journey by sea: a relative, neighbor or friend. In recent weeks, the United Nations says there has been a surge of boat people, hundreds of Rohingya cramming into small boats and leaving on a daily basis. They surrender themselves to human traffickers waiting in cargo ships at sea, who then charge extortionate prices with the promise to smuggle passengers to Malaysia. At a little fishing port outside the provincial capital of Sittwe, carpenters building wooden boats explained how the system works. ""Fifty to 60 people fit into a boat like this,"" said Mahmud Yacoub, who squatted barefoot clutching a hammer in the skeleton of new wooden vessel about 20 feet long. ""The travelers are mixed: men, women and children. It is dangerous and very expensive."" READ MORE: 'Caught between a hammer and an anvil' The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar this way since ethnic and sectarian violence erupted in the country's western Rakhine state in the summer of 2012. Hundreds died making the seaborne journey. The 2012 clashes between the state's Rakhine Buddhist community and Rohingya Muslims, a long-oppressed linguistic and ethnic minority in this majority Buddhist country, left hundreds dead and more than 140,000 people homeless. More than two years after the violence, the government has forcibly segregated Rohingya from the rest of the population in Rakhine state. They live confined in enclaves -- rural ghettos, in effect -- from which they are not allowed to leave. In Sittwe, a town where Rohingya once lived side by side with Rakhines, it is now impossible to find a Rohingya walking down the street. One of the main mosques is still in ruins after it was torched in June 2012. Another mosque appears to be occupied by Myanmar police. READ MORE: Obama takes on Myanmar during Asian trip . ""Rohingya doesn't exist. Never exist!"" repeated U Than Tun, a member of the Emergency Coordination Center in Sittwe, which overseas the distribution of humanitarian assistance to the state's poor and homeless population. He echoed the Myanmar government's official position, which denies recognition of the term ""Rohingya."" Instead, U Than Tun referred to Rohingya as ""Bengalis,"" and described even those who have lived in Myanmar for generations as ""illegal immigrants"" from neighboring Bangladesh. It is part of a decades-old policy that has prevented Rohingya from being full citizens in Myanmar, leaving a million of them effectively stateless. Some community leaders in Sittwe want to take this policy of exclusion one dramatic step further. ""We want to expel the Bengalis from this land,"" said Than Tun, who is also a high school teacher in Sittwe. The call for the expulsion of the Rakhine State's estimated 1.3 million Rohingya was echoed by a senior Buddhist monk at a monastery across town. ""It may be best if they are not here,"" said U Kaymasara. Several of his followers sat on the floor near his chair in deference as the monk explained his views. U Kaymasara claimed the Rohingya threaten to demographically overwhelm the state's Rakhine population. ""In one Muslim family there are 82 people,"" the monk claimed. ""In Rakhine families, there are maximum three or four or five."" According to government statistics, Rohingya make up only about one-third of the population in Rakhine state. U.N. officials warn the strict confinement of Rohingya to enclaves has destroyed their ability to rebuild their lives after the violence and arson of 2012. ""Lack of movement means people don't have access to their fields to go farming, don't have access to the sea to go fishing, don't have access to markets to trade,"" said Pierre Peron, spokesperson for the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Myanmar. ""The impact on freedom of movement is quite massive on hundreds of thousands of people."" In one of the camps built for displaced Rohingya with the help of international aid organizations, several men told CNN they had no hope of finding work outside their state-designated enclave. ""The Rakhines burned down my house and my shop,"" said a gray-haired man named Raza Mia. He said his family of 10 now survived by sending their children into Rohingya villages to beg for food. Another man named Nur Bashir said he had been employed as a welder in the state water and transportation department before 2012. Now, he didn't dare try to return to the Sittwe, where he had once lived and worked. ""If I go to Sittwe on my own,"" Nur Bashir said, ""I think the Rakhine will kill me."" His statement was all the more dramatic because he was speaking in a camp located barely a mile from downtown Sittwe. Police and soldiers here were deployed throughout the zone where Rohingya had been allowed to live. In one area, they marked the territory where Rohingya were allowed to move by erecting red flags along an abandoned railroad. Several Rohingya men said they were not allowed to cross the railroad tracks to the Rakhine village less than 100 yards away, where farmers could be seen tending their fields. But even within the Rohingya enclave, locals said there were periods of the day when security forces prevented Rohingya from using the main road. That coincided with the hours when Rakhine students used the same road, to get to classes at Sittwe University, which is located within the enclave. Students there told CNN that since the clashes of 2012, Rohingya students had stopped studying at the university. Young Rakhine men at the university disagreed on whether the Rohingya should be allowed to go back to the university. ""I want to live as we did before, living peacefully,"" said 22-year-old Nyo Layn, who added that he wouldn't mind welcome back Rohingya students. But 19-year old Mah Win So said,""I don't want Muslim students here because I don't trust them."" He added, ""I want them all to go back to their native place, which is Bangladesh."" Human rights organizations have denounced the policies of the Myanmar government. ""There couldn't be a clearer case of ethnic cleansing,"" said Matthew Smith, executive director of Fortify Rights, a human rights group that has extensively researched the crisis in Rakhine state. ""The authorities and local Buddhist populations are trying to change the ethnic demographics of the state through terror-inspiring means, and in some cases violence."" Top government officials in Myanmar have repeatedly denied these accusations. But the sharp increase of Rohingya making the perilous journey out by sea suggests members of this community see little future staying in the country of their birth.","A decades-old policy has prevented Rohingya from being full citizens in Myanmar .

"Scientists looking for signs of life in the universe -- as well as another planet like our own -- are a lot closer to their goal than people realize. That was the consensus of a panel on the search for life in the universe held at NASA headquarters Monday in Washington. The discussion focused not only on the philosophical question of whether we're alone in the universe but also on the technological advances made in an effort to answer that question. ""We believe we're very, very close in terms of technology and science to actually finding the other Earth and our chance to find signs of life on another world,"" said Sara Seager, a MacArthur Fellow and professor of planetary science and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""Finding Earth's twin, that's kind of the holy grail,"" said John Grunsfeld, an astronaut who helped repair the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009 and is now an associate administrator at NASA. Strides in the search for life . Scientists have made stellar strides in the past few years alone. ""We already know that our galaxy has at least 100 billion planets, and we didn't know that five years ago,"" said Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland. He credited the work of the Kepler Space Telescope for these new discoveries. The planet-hunting Kepler probe, launched in 2009, finds planets by looking for dips in the brightness of a star as a planet transits, or crosses, in front of that star. Kepler also found the first Earth-size planet that orbits in a star's habitable zone, the area around a star where a planet could exist with liquid water on its surface. The Kepler mission builds upon the stalwart Hubble Space Telescope, which launched in 1990 and was the first of its kind to be placed in space.  As Hubble orbits the Earth, it allows scientists to peer back in time, into distant galaxies, and yields stunning images of the cosmos. Hubble has helped shape our awareness of our planet's place in an ever-changing universe. The Earth, though 4.5 billion years old, is a newcomer, said John Mather, senior project scientist on NASA's next-generation James Webb Space Telescope. It's only about one-third of the age of the universe. And our galaxy is ever-evolving, with ""about five or 10 new stars being born per year in our Milky Way,"" Mather said. Planet hunters . Hubble's astounding views come from a vantage point only 353 miles above our Earth. In comparison, the James Webb telescope will be a whopping 930,000 miles from our planet. That's close to four times the distance between the Earth and the moon. Webb is set to launch in 2018. Mountain, who is the telescope scientist for Webb, said scientists now know where every single star is within 200 light years of the Sun. NASA's assembled panelists said, if they follow this map of stars, they're certain to find a multitude of new planets. ""Every star in the sky is a sun, and if our sun has planets, we naturally expect those other stars to have planets also, and they do,"" said Seager.  She said if someone looked up at a starry sky and wondered how many of the stars have planets, the answer would be ""basically every single one."" Some of a star's light will shine through the atmosphere, said Seager, and the Webb telescope should be able to pick up gases from the planet that are imprinted on the atmosphere.  While the Webb telescope wasn't designed to find signs of life on another planet, it can spot biosignature gases -- gases in the atmosphere produced by life. Seager said, with the James Webb telescope, ""we have our first chance, our first capability of finding signs of life on another planet. Now nature just has to provide for us."" Spotting Earths . Finding small planets, ones the size of Earth, is challenging, in part because they produce fainter signals, said Dave Gallagher, director for astronomy and physics at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who likened it to spotting a firefly beside a searchlight. That difficulty doesn't dull the hunt for another Earth or signs of life. NASA administrator Charles Bolden said he counts himself among the people who ""are probably convinced that it's highly improbable in the limitless vastness of the universe that we humans stand alone.""","NASA convenes panel on search for life in the universe .

"Sepp Blatter has been criticized in a damning Council of Europe report into FIFA's handling of bribery allegations which only came to light after a sports marketing company that the world football governing body worked with went bust. The report, which will be debated by the council's Parliamentary Assembly Wednesday, said it would be  ""difficult to imagine"" that the FIFA president body would have been unaware of ""significant sums"" paid to unnamed  FIFA officials by  ISSM/ISL in connection with lucrative contracts for World Cup television rights. The Council of Europe published testimony on its website, supplied to them by Thomas Hildbrand, the Swiss prosecutor in a court case investigating the 2001 bankruptcy and collapse of ISL. Hildbrand said bribes worth at least 12.7 million Swiss francs ($14 million) were paid to a South American FIFA member, known as ""person H,"" while another 1.5 million Swiss Francs ($1.65 million) went to another senior FIFA official, identified only as ""person E,""  to secure the rights. The Council of Europe covering report by French national assembly member Francois Rochebloine singles out Blatter for his part in the affair, although making no allegations of involvement in corruption. It states: ""Mr. Blatter was technical director of FIFA from 1975 to 1981, FIFA general secretary from 1981 to 1998 and has been its president ever since. Since FIFA was aware of significant sums paid to certain of its officials, it is difficult to imagine that Mr. Blatter would not have known about this. Blatter rejects Council of Europe's call for FIFA election probe . ""That does not mean he was directly involved in this case of backhanders. But I believe it is extraordinary he did nothing to make public all the information which FIFA had or has, and took no steps whether internally or via the courts to enable FIFA to obtain reparation. ""The money paid under the counter to certain unscrupulous officials should have been paid to FIFA."" Rochebloine's report concluded by highlighting remarks made by Blatter in answer to a question by CNN's Manesh Shrestha at a press conference in Katmandhu, Nepal on March 9 over calls for an investigation into his re-election as FIFA president. Blatter was quoted as saying: ""We need, naturally, also the acceptance of the political authorities -- but we don't like political authorities interfering in our internal affairs."" Rochebloine responded: ""The independence of sport -- to which we remain committed -- should not become a defense for those who abuse their authority. It is wrong to have accusations without proof, but it is our duty to ask for the truth to be sought and established. ""The money managed by FIFA is money that belongs to football and not to its officials, but in addition no sports organization can become a place where the law does not apply and where corruption and fraud are in practice tolerated and go unpunished. What is at issue here is compliance with the rule of law."" FIFA gave its reaction to the report in an emailed statement to CNN: ""FIFA has already made its position very clear on the report and on the ISL/ISMM closing order (FIFA has repeatedly said it would like the closing order to be published), and will not make any further comment for the time being."" Last month FIFA's executive committee announced plans for a new two-tier ethics committee -- one to investigate corruption, the other to rule on the cases. It acted after corruption allegations in both last year's presidential race, won unopposed by Blatter, and the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup. Blatter was the only candidate for a fourth term of office after Mohamed Bin Hammam, president of the Asian Football Federation, was suspended over bribery allegations and eventually banned for life by FIFA. The Council of Europe report will be considered by over 300 parliamentarians from the 47 Council of Europe member states in Strasbourg. The Council of Europe was founded in 1949 to foster co-operation between European states with particular reference to democracy, legal judgments and human rights.","Sepp Blatter singled out in Council of Europe report into bribery allegations .

"(CNN) -- It's not news that the Internet enjoys killing celebrities. But the hoaxes seem a bit meaner and more callous when the details appear to be lifted from an actual accident involving a fatality. ""Seinfeld"" star Wayne Knight took to Twitter over the weekend to dispel a fake report he had been killed in a car crash on Route 446 in Pennsylvania. According to the story that made the rounds on the Web -- including a fake TMZ website -- the accident involved his Mercedes, which crashed into a tractor-trailer near the Pennsylvania-New York state line. ""Some of you will be glad to hear this, others strangely disappointed, but . . .I am alive and well!,"" he tweeted. He later added, ""Does someone have to DIE to trend? Geez! Thanks for all the love everybody. I didn't know you cared. Glad to be breathing!"" However, someone did die recently in a crash at that site. The Buffalo (New York) News reported that Lindsay M. Schmit, 26, was killed Thursday when the Chevrolet Malibu she was traveling in crossed the center line on Route 446 and was struck by a tractor-trailer. Schmit's fiancÃ©, Christopher Johnston, and her 2-year-old son, Carter Pontius, were also in the car and critically injured. Stars are often the targets of such hoaxes. Actor Eddie Murphy has been ""killed"" several times on Twitter, and actor Jeff Goldblum appeared on ""The Colbert Report"" in 2009 to announce that he was, in fact, still alive despite Internet reports to the contrary. TMZ.today, which posted the fake Knight death report, also posted an erroneous report that former ""Family Ties"" child star Brian Bonsall had died of a drug overdose. The headline for the story listed the actor as ""Bosnell."" Bonsall appeared to take the news in in stride, tweeting from his unverified account, ""Well apparently i'm dead, lol but I'll have you know I'm doing well and enjoying a cup of coffee at home."" According to The Hollywood Reporter, several sites picked up on the Knight death hoax, which also appeared on a fake US Weekly site. The Hollywood Reporter attempted to trace the fake sites and reported that the registration names for TMZ.today are listed as private, while the fake Usmagazine.us site is registered to someone named Ryan Wiseman in San Antonio. Unlike his ""Seinfeld"" character Newman, Knight showed he had a heart, offering his condolences to Schmit's loved ones and apologies to those taken aback by the premature reports of his passing. ""Regrets to my friends and family who were shocked this morning and the family of the woman who actually died in my 'supposed' accident,"" he tweeted.","Wayne Knight of ""Seinfeld"" fame tweeted he didn't die after fake reports .

"(CNN)Richard Glossip has spent 17 years in a tiny cell in H Unit of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, close to the death chamber. Every execution is a reminder that his turn will come one day. He got that reminder again Thursday when Charles Warner became the first inmate to be executed in Oklahoma since last April. That's when Clayton Lockett died in what was widely seen as a botched lethal injection process. ""I've seen it on TV,"" says Glossip, 51, in a telephone call from death row. He says he's reconciled with his fate, though he has always maintained his innocence. He says he has long believed that without mental preparation, things will not go well in his final moments. But when he learned that Lockett's was one of the longest executions in U.S. history and that he moaned and writhed on the gurney for 43 minutes before dying of a heart attack, a new anxiety set in. ""I am worried they will botch it again,"" he says. The bungled execution horrified people around the world, and the state put a moratorium on carrying out the ultimate punishment until it could fully review what happened. But Oklahoma's decision to go forth Thursday with a variation of the same drug formula concerned death penalty lawyers who say the state still risks violating the Constitution by inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on inmates. Attorneys for Warner, Glossip and two other Oklahoma inmates facing execution appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday for stays until the new protocol could be evaluated. But the justices voted 5-4 to deny the application. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that she was ""deeply troubled"" by the continued use of midazolam, a sedative at the heart of the lethal injection controversy. Attorney Dale Baich, one of the lawyers who filed the suit, says the Supreme Court will have to revisit this issue in the near future. ""The drugs and drug combinations used in executions today vary tremendously across different jurisdictions,"" he says. ""This experimentation has led to the predictable but tragic result of multiple botched executions. The court's guidance on the practices currently employed in lethal injection is urgently needed."" Oklahoma officials say, however, that they have addressed the concerns that surfaced after Lockett and put new equipment and protocol in place. So, shortly after 7 p.m. (8 p.m. ET), in a renovated death chamber, the lethal cocktail began flowing into the veins of Warner, convicted of the first-degree rape and murder of his then-girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter. He was pronounced dead at 7:28 p.m. Glossip is scheduled to die next, on January 29. Oklahoma spent $71,000 renovating the chamber and the adjacent witness rooms so that executioners have more space. The state also spent $34,000 on new equipment, including a $12,500 gurney that replaced one from the 1950s and an ultrasound machine to help detect veins. But the state did not deem it necessary to change its controversial three-drug formula. Of particular concern is the use of the sedative midazolam, also used in two other executions that went awry: Dennis McGuire agonized for 26 minutes in Ohio, and Joseph Wood gasped more than 600 times and took two hours to die in Arizona. Witnesses in Oklahoma said Lockett regained consciousness after the sedative was administered. They said he grimaced and suffered for many minutes. Lockett's execution was halted after his IV needle dislodged and spewed blood, but he later died. A state investigation linked the problem to the IV lines not being inserted correctly. This has been a problem in other executions as well. ""What they have not done is investigate whether their use of midazolam in the Lockett execution contributed to the fiasco that resulted,"" says Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which does not officially take a position but is widely seen as anti-capital punishment. Oklahoma upped its dosage of midazolam to 500 milligrams, compared with the 100 milligrams Lockett got. But Dieter says there is no proof that increasing the dosage will avoid problems. ""They have not shown that this drug will produce the necessary level of unconsciousness to allow the execution to proceed humanely,"" he says. Florida uses the same three-drug cocktail and it, too, executed a convicted murderer Thursday after the Supreme Court gave the green light. Johnny Shane Kormondy was declared dead at 8:16 p.m. at the Florida State Prison in Starke. Until 2010, states employed a fairly standard drug formula to carry out the death penalty that included the anesthetic sodium thiopental. But after the sole U.S. manufacturer stopped making the drug and European companies refused to sell it for use in executions, states faced drug shortages for the lethal cocktail and searched desperately for alternatives. Midazolam, commonly used as a sedative before surgery, was first used in Florida in 2011 without any guarantees that the inmate would remain sedated long enough. Witnesses who watched convicted murderer William Happ die said that he remained conscious longer than those who were killed with the old formula. Death penalty opponents say the use of midazolam amounts essentially to experimentation on human beings. But four states use the drug in their lethal injections. The executions Thursday in Oklahoma and Florida began with midazolam. Then the inmates were injected with a paralytic agent to prevent the inmate from flailing, followed by potassium chloride, which stopped their hearts. Glossip thinks about what he might feel after he is strapped into the gurney and the drugs begin coursing through his veins. He has spent the last few weeks imagining a disastrous end like Lockett's. Helen Prejean, a Catholic nun who ministers to the condemned and has spoken with Glossip, says he is haunted by Lockett's agony. ""He's scared,"" she says: that the sedative won't do its job, that he will be helpless to stop the pain. It's difficult for many people to feel any sympathy for a man who was convicted in a hire-for-murder scheme that resulted in the 1997 death of Barry Alan Van Treese, owner of a Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City. Van Treese's family appeared at a clemency hearing for Glossip in October and spoke of the many ways they missed a husband, father and brother. They said too often, victims of crime are forgotten in the capital punishment process. ""I will speak for my brother,"" said Kenneth Van Treese. ""It hurts like hell to have your head bashed in with a baseball bat. Do not feel sorry for the bastard who took my life."" Van Treese's sister, Alana Van Treese Mileto, told the clemency board that the death penalty was not revenge, but the law. But attorneys for death row inmates say Oklahoma's execution protocol remains unconstitutional. Their appeal to the Supreme Court says the state is relying on a ""drug that cannot reliably produce or maintain a deep, comalike unconsciousness."" Baich, one of Warner's attorneys, says midazolam was not part of the lethal injection protocol approved by the Supreme Court in 2008. Simply increasing the dosage, he says, does not overcome the risk and leaves Oklahoma open to inhumane action. ""Oklahoma's current execution protocol creates a substantial risk of severe pain, needless suffering and a lingering death,"" Baich says. CNN contacted the Oklahoma Department of Corrections for comment and was referred to the execution protocol posted on its website. Glossip says he can't believe Oklahoma resumed the use of a sedative that has been so problematic, one that, ironically, bought him time. He might have been dead already -- his initial execution date was set in November -- but the state postponed it because it said it wasn't quite prepared with its new procedures. For a while, Glossip got to leave a special holding cell for the final 35 days before execution and return to his old one, located beneath the death chamber. He was glad for that. In the holding cell, two fluorescent lights glared down on him 24/7. His plexiglass-wrapped television set was revoked. He was allowed a single book but chose to write letters instead. Many inmates ask for a Bible, he says. At Christmas, he launched a hunger strike. That way, he could have some agency over his death, he thought. But Prejean, who is planning to be with him at his execution, persuaded him to eat. ""I feel especially responsible for Richard,"" she says. ""A few days ago I urged him to eat again so he can fight to expose the horrible injustice, not only for himself but for all who go through this torture."" Glossip has exhausted all appeals of his verdict and sentence. He was tried twice for Van Treese's killing -- the first conviction was tossed because of incompetent legal representation. But a second jury also convicted him. Prosecutors said Glossip hired maintenance worker Justin Sneed to take a baseball bat and bludgeon their boss Van Treese to death because Glossip thought he would be fired. At trial, Sneed testified that he killed Van Treese at Glossip's behest and received a life sentence. Glossip was sentenced to death. ""Twice a jury has heard the evidence against Richard Glossip and twice a jury has convicted him and sentenced him to death for his role in the murder of Barry Van Treese,"" says Aaron Cooper, a spokesman for the Oklahoma attorney general. Glossip holds steadfast to his innocence. He says he is being put to death even though the real killer lied and gets to live. ""I feel sorry for Barry's family,"" Glossip says. ""But I did not commit a crime."" He adds, ""At first I was angry at Justin, but now I feel sorry for him. He's afraid of how Oklahoma will kill him if he owns up to what really happened, just like I am afraid of how they'll kill me. It's fear making him lie about what happened."" These days Glossip thinks about his late parents -- his mother died just a year ago -- and 14 siblings. He thinks about what it would feel like to see green grass and trees again. To smell fresh air. They are things that Van Treese's family wishes their loved one could see now, too.","Oklahoma put a hold on executions after a botched one in April .

"(CNN) -- ""Gee whiz! Look at that horizon. It's curved a little bit and the clouds are way down there. I wonder what the picture's going to look like?"" recalls famed astronaut Buzz Aldrin. He's perhaps best known for becoming the second person to walk on the moon, as part of the 1969 Apollo moon landing, but Aldrin unknowingly made history when in 1966, he snapped the ""first space selfie."" Taken while on the 10th and final Gemini mission -- Gemini 12 -- Aldrin revealed the story behind the selfie to CNN. WATCH: Buzz Aldrin's space selfie . ""I didn't realize I was pioneering the selfies,"" he says with his usual wide-eyed enthusiasm. ""We were docked to the other spacecraft, Agena. There was an experimenter from Northwestern University and he wanted pictures taken of ultraviolet stars. So we could only take pictures at night."" He adds: ""During the day pass, I'm looking down at the Astrodome, some of the lakes around Houston, so what am I going to do during the daytime? Look at the camera and hit the button."" And that was that. Aldrin had just snapped what he claims is the ""first selfie in space."" Today it's the norm and NASA has gotten incredibly good at sharing the best shots with the world on social media. But it's not just astronauts. Scientists and engineers are getting in on the action, too, by having the robots and orbiters out and about the galaxy take happy snaps of their alien surroundings. Scroll through the gallery above to see more. Meanwhile, almost 50 years on, Aldrin reflects on his other ""first"" and concedes he took the pioneering pic out of boredom. ""What for? I don't know. I wondered what I looked like. Another claim to fame for Buzz,"" he says leaning forward with a cheeky grin on his face.

"Former FIFA president Joao Havelange and fellow Brazilian sports chief Ricardo Teixeira pocketed millions of dollars in bribes from a collapsed marketing company, documents released by a Swiss court Wednesday revealed. Havelange received at least 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.53 million) while Teixeira, who was at one time his son-in-law, was paid at least CHF 12.4 million ($12.64 million). The backhanders, made by International Sport and Leisure (ISL), were detailed in a judgment by Switzerland's supreme court, which was also published on the official FIFA website. ISL, a former official marketing partner for FIFA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), was made bankrupt in 2001 with estimated debts of around $300 million, but the fallout from that collapse has reverberated around the world of sport. Havelange, who is now 96, stepped down as president of football's world governing body in 1998 after 24 years at the helm, but is still an honorary FIFA president. He resigned as a member of the IOC last December, citing ill health, just a few days before it was due to sanction him after a probe by its own ethics committee into payments by ISL to leading officials. IOC sanctions two leading sports officials over ISL link . Teixeira was forced to quit his position on FIFA's executive committee and stand down as head of Brazil's 2014 World Cup organizing committee earlier this year when it became clear the report would be published. Both had tried to block its publication in the Swiss courts. FIFA said Wednesday it was ""pleased"" the documents had been made public and on its website highlighted the fact Havelange and Teixeira had been named while its current president, Sepp Blatter, was not. ""The decision of the Swiss Federal Court also confirms that only two foreign officials will be named as part of the process and that, as previously communicated by the Prosecutor of Zug in June 2010, the FIFA President is not involved in the case ('no Swiss person involved'),"" read FIFA's statement. The court documents reveal that Teixeira had paid CHF 2.5 million ($2.55 million) and Havelange CHF 500,000 ($510,000) in compensation. FIFA was accused by the court of having a ""deficient organization"" and was being investigated for ""disloyal management."" It was also stated FIFA had paid CHF 2.5 million ($2.55 million) in compensation -- but only agreed to the conditions if criminal actions against Havelange and Teixeira were dropped. Havelange played a key role in bringing the 2016 Olympics to Rio de Janeiro when the South American city was awarded the Games in 2009. He became an IOC member in 1963 and was FIFA president between 1974 and 1998 until Blatter, his longtime secretary general, took charge. Havelange spent two months in hospital earlier this year with a heart problem and infected ankle, but he once famously invited IOC members to his 100th birthday party on Copacabana beach in 2016 should Rio get the Games.","Swiss court details bribes paid to Joao Havelange by marketing company .
