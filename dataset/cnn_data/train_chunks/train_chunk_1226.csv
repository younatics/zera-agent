"A man who made a deathbed confession that linked him to a cold case murder from 1995 now faces jail because of what he thought was a last-ditch effort for a clean conscience. James Washington was having a heart attack when he called a police officer over to his hospital bed in 2009. While he hoped for absolution, what he got instead was a medical miracle. And now, a murder charge. Grim prospects: James Washington was having a heart attack in 2009 when he confessed to a murder dating back to 1995 . Record: When Washington had the heart attack, he was in jail for a different crime. He had always been linked to the murder of Joyce Goodener in 1995 but there was never enough to charge him . Washington had long been linked to the murder of Joyce Goodener, who was found stabbed in the neck, beaten to death with a cinderblock and set on fire in an abandoned Nashville, Tennessee house. A lack of sufficient evidence- most significantly there were no DNA samples- kept the police from arresting anyone over the past 17 years. 'I didn't have any trust in the system,' Ms Goodener's daughter Sonya Kimbrell told local station WSMV. 'All of a sudden, I got this phone call and they said, ""We think we found him.""' Victim: Joyce Goodener was found with a stab wound to her neck, having been badly beaten with a cement block and then lit on fire after she was killed . Relief: Goodener's daughter Sonya Kimbrell (pictured) did not believe that they would find her mother's killer . At the time of his 2009 heart attack, Washington was in jail for a different crime, so when he was escorted to the hospital with the severe chest pains, there was a police officer nearby. 'He kind of got as best as he could, motioned, and said ""I have something to tell you. I have  to get something off my conscience and you need to hear this,""' said transport guard James Tomlinson. 'He said ""I killed somebody. I beat her to death,""' Mr Tomlinson added. Confessor: James Tomlinson was the guard who transported Washington to the hospital during his heart attack, and he was the one to hear Washington's confession . With that weight lifted off his conscience but added on to his rap sheet, Washington proceeded to live through the heart attack and was sentenced to life in prison. Even though he tried to talk back the confession in the wake of the hospital stay, he was found guilty in court and now faces up to 51 years behind bars. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .

"A host of new changes are being made by Penn State administrators in an effort to show that the school is moving past the trial of former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky where he was sentenced to jail for abusing multiple boys both in and out of the football team's showers. Loyal fans may still carry out the tradition of dressing in white for games and coming early to the school's Beaver stadium to cheer on the team, but they won't find themselves screaming the lyrics to Neil Diamond's hit Sweet Carolina as they have for many seasons past. Given some of the song's provocative lyrics- which include 'touching me, touching you'- athletic officials decided to keep it off the pep band's playlist for the upcoming season. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No more singing: Penn State will not blast Sweet Caroline during football games anymore because of the potential for double entendres in the wake of the sex abuse scandal that rocked the athletic program . Inspiration: Singer Neil Diamond (left) admitted that the song was based off a photo he saw of a then-11-year-old Caroline Kennedy (right), which he later sang at her 50th birthday . In the wake of the scandal that erupted following the discovery that Sandusy sexually abused up to ten young boys, university officials are taking decisive steps to steer clear of any double entendres. Local paper The Altoona Mirror reported the playlist update as the school released the details about changes fans can expect when they attend games this coming season. Sweet Caroline has been played regularly at the team's home games for years, and Penn State was not alone as the song is also favored by the Boston Red Sox, the University of Pittsburgh, and Denison University. Diamond's hit, which has an unusual story . behind it as it was inspired by a picture he saw of President John F. Kennedy's daughter Caroline when she was 11-years-old, is not the only . one that devoted fans will miss this season. NBC Sports . reports that the 1972 hit Rock And Roll, Part Two will not be played . either, as it was made famous by British singer Gary Glitter. Glitter . was arrested in the late 1990s for possession of child pornography and . committing obscene acts with minors in Vietnam a decade later. In addition to musical changes, an . updated roster, new coaching staff and alternative pre-game strategy . will also greet the fans that turn up to see how the team fares after . they were given extensive NCAA penalties. Change: Penn State's new head coach Bill . O'Brien, right, said he's looking to make a few changes to usher in the . team's 'new era' that could include a uniform shake up. The iconic . outfit is seen on Brandon Short, left, . Scandal: The announcement comes after Penn State opted to remove a statue of once storied and now shamed former head coach Joe Paterno and the ex-assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's guilty verdicts . The . so-called Nittany Lions have been banned by the governing authority . from making it to any bowl games for the next four years, have been . ordered to pay a $60million fine, and had all of Paterno's wins stripped . from their record dating back the 1998 when Sandusky was originally . investigated internally over one instance of sex abuse. The . team will be lead onto the field by new coach Bill O'Brien, who . formerly worked for the New England Patriots, and they will be sporting . their names on the backs of their jerseys for the first time ever- a . move which the coach hopes will help show they are in a 'new era'. 'We've . got a group of young men there, like I said, that are sticking . together. And there's changes that have taken place at Penn State over . the last six months that are reflected already,' he said in a press . conference late last month. For years, Neil Diamond kept quiet about what inspired his 1969 single, but he decided to break his silence in 2007. He said that when he was struggling . musician, he saw a picture of then-first daughter Caroline Kennedy . taking a stroll on her horse. At . the time, she was 11-years-old. 'It was a picture of a little girl . dressed to the nines in her riding gear, next to her pony. It was such . an innocent, wonderful picture, I immediately felt there was a song in . there,' he previously said. In spite of his assertions, some lyrics are slightly unseemly given the age of the inspiration. Aside from the 'hands, touching . hands, reaching out, touching me, touching you' portion of the song . which Penn State officials took issue with, another portion could also . be considered objectionable. Later in the song, he sings 'Look at the night / And it don't seem so lonely / We fill it up with only two'. It was only in 2007, when he sang the . hit via video stream at Ms Kennedy's 50th birthday that he revealed the . former first daughter as the inspiration. 'Innocent': Though this picture was taken when Caroline was only five years old, it shows her (right) with her pet pony Macaroni, and then-President father JFK (left) and young brother John Jr. outside of the Oval Office .

She is also charged with providing a service that enabled others 'to obtain, read, listen to or look at a terrorist publication, by providing links to speeches and other propaganda, and at the time of doing so intended an effect of her conduct to be a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism'.

The new counter-terror legislation will hand police powers to force internet firms to hand over details that could help identify suspected terrorists.

"The BBC was accused of 'disgraceful' bias yesterday over its coverage of Baroness Thatcher's death. Angry viewers complained its news bulletins gave too great an emphasis to her critics and to controversies such as the poll tax and the miners' strike. Twitter users accused the BBC of 'shameless' bias against the former Prime Minister. The broadcaster also faced criticism because newsreaders did not wear black ties following the announcement of her death. Scroll down for video .

Lady Thatcher made clear her dislike of those running the BBC and . complained about its 'Left-wing' bias. In the hours following the announcement of her death, those feelings were echoed by many. EF, . London, declared: 'Shameless Marxist BBC, Ken Livingstone. Tony Benn. You name the socialist, they've interviewed them to try and ruin the . memory of this great lady.' Paul . Wells said: 'The BBC 10 o'clock news coverage of Baroness Thatcher's . death is an absolute Left-wing biased disgrace . . . I want a TV licence . refund now!' 'Baroness . Thatcher a great leader of 20th Century, BBC brings on the haters and . emphasises insignificant disturbances. Angry about the bias,' tweeted . Bazee@Bazee. Ken Scott . claimed: 'BBC News showing their left-wing credentials by dragging a . load of Thatcher haters out for interview. All of them waste-of-time . has-beens!' Chris Latimer . tweeted: 'I am beginning to see the point of view of those who think the . #bbc is Left-wing. Their coverage of Thatcher's death has been . disgraceful.' Concern over the BBC coverage was also . reflected on Mail Online, where Jiminy posted: 'The BBC allowed a union . spokesman to be broadcast on Radio 2 news this evening saying that no . tears would be shed in the North East following Margaret Thatcher's . death. 'I consider this to . be the most cynical, nasty thing the BBC has allowed to be broadcast in . many years. I will be writing to complain. Sickened.' There . was also criticism that TV anchors failed to show sufficient respect. Huw Edwards, who was presenting a programme on Lady Thatcher on both the .

One Twitter user said: 'Would it be too much for the BBC news readers to put on a black tie and show some respect!?' Another user, MediaUK.com managing director James Cridland, tweeted: 'No black tie for BBC News Channel presenter? Surprising.' However, other users noted that BBC presenter Mark Mardell was wearing a black tie, whereas Sky's Adam Boulton was not. A . BBC spokesman said he could not comment on whether there was any policy . regarding black ties, but added: 'The guidance is to dress as . appropriate, to dress soberly.' The . BBC News website made an embarrassing gaffe when it reported briefly . that Lady Thatcher had died following a 'strike' rather than a stroke.

Mr Benn . is pictured here with miners' leader Arthur Scargill (centre) in 1984 . One Twitter user complained: 'Typical BBC left left left!

Ireland were devastated by Thatcherism . . . her draconian policies . prolonged the war here, she is most famously remembered for the 1980s . hunger strikes.' The BBC also invited Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to give his views within hours of her death . Critics said it was 'disrespectful' to air an interview with Mr Adams on the day of Lady Thatcher's death, given that the IRA tried to kill the former Prime Minister. Tory MP Ben Wallace said: 'I think it's disrespectful to give such a significant amount of coverage to a man who belongs to an organisation which tried to murder her.' One of Thatcher's arch critics – former Labour MP Tony Benn – was one of the first invited to speak on BBC 5 Live and BBC World Service and was given free rein to criticise Lady Thatcher. He said: 'Margaret Thatcher taught us the meaning of class war, we have paid a very heavy price for it. 'She used the power she had to make war on the miners and the trade union movement . . . and it was a very divisive period as Prime Minister, but you have to recognise that was what she believed and that meant she was not just fooling and she did in a sense open up the meaning of the phrase 'class war” as she used her power to make war on trade unions and the majority of the population.' A BBC spokesman said: 'The death of Baroness Thatcher was a big breaking story of considerable interest to our audiences. 'BBC News sensitively and respectfully reported the story as news of the death broke and continues to provide extensive coverage and analysis across TV, radio and online featuring a range of voices and opinions.' On the use of the word 'strike' instead of 'stroke', the spokesman said: 'This was an error which was quickly corrected.' * An Irish cricketer has apologised after tweeting that he hoped Lady Thatcher's death had been 'slow and painful'. All-rounder John Mooney, who scored the winning runs in Ireland's historic win over England at the 2011 Cricket World Cup, has deleted the message.

They will call the baby William Petit III after his father and grandfather.

Dr Petit . was severely beaten and dumped in the basement but managed to escape. He and Christine, a professional photographer, announced shortly before their first wedding anniversary on August 5 that they were expecting a child. Messages of congratulations flooded into Dr Petit's Twitter page in the last 24 hours. When local news station WFSB interviewed the couple, Petit said he was very excited about the prospect of a new baby, and that he is ready to start changing diapers again. Responding to the reporter's question about starting a family again, Dr Petit turned somber, saying ‘children are always your jewels'. ‘Children are the hope for the future,’ he said with a catch in his throat, adding that most parents aim to teach children how to be good people and help others. After . the years of darkness that William Petit lived through in the aftermath . of his family's massacre, the bereaved husband and father was craving . light - his new wife stepped in to brighten his life in every way . possible.

Petit met at a local country club in 2008, where she worked as a marketing director. After they got chatting, she offered her professional photography services to the foundation. In April, she released pictures of their new home and life together and explained how they have found peace in Western Connecticut. When the killers went on trial in 2011, Christine was there for Petit, sitting behind him in the courthouse along with his relatives and listening to hours of agonizing testimony. Last year they got married and moved into a small but cozy home in Farmington River in western Connecticut. The . Petits painted the walls of the living room white, and Christine . filled the cozy space with cheerful purple and lavender touches, as well . as a large white dandelion-shaped chandelier. 'This . was all dark. All dark. Then she put these funky lights in. Put a new . floor in, got rid of some furniture,' Dr Petit told Esquire Magazine at the time. In . the years after the murders, the former endocrinologist dreaded the . night and all the traumatic memories and irrational fears that would . creep into his mind in the dark. But . now, with the calm, reassuring presence of his new wife by his side, . Petit has learned to welcome the hour when he retires to bed every . night. However, he . still counts the days, hours and minutes since his daughters died in the . worst way imaginable.

They shared their emotional wedding ceremony last year with 300 family and friends, before moving into their quaint new home. They chose to sleep in the smaller bedroom rather than the master bedroom because it faced the water - bringing with it the view and peace they crave. It is a new home away from the Cheshire home William shared with his wife Jennifer for 18 years, where his daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, grew up. And also the place were they breathed their last breaths. William has not returned there since that fateful Sunday in July 2007.

Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack . William quit practicing medicine after the horrific incident and has now dedicated his life to the foundation. He was approached last month about running for Congress and told reporters he was considering it after having talks with Republican Party officials. He is continually touched by those who have reached out to him and donated their money, time and kindness. After the home invasion, 25,000 pieces of mail came from all over the world. Some sent money for the foundation, a dollar bill, a $5,000 check, a handwritten note, a card. They were all answered, even when there were no return addresses, the Petits found them. The donations still come in. Among one of William's favorites, according to Esquire magazine, are from three little brothers who, every year at their birthday parties, ask friends to make a donation to the foundation instead of buying a present. William thinks people understand the mission statement - to foster the education of young people, especially women in the sciences, to improve the lives of those affected by chronic illnesses and to support efforts to protect and help those affected by violence. The house burned down beyond any salvation, the building and its foundation had to be razed and carted away. Residents of the affluent cul-de-sac turned it into a memorial garden - though William never goes there.

"A Chicago-born man kidnapped as a toddler and taken to Mexico by his father more than three decades ago is hoping to be reunited with his mother after he was was caught sneaking back across the border last month. Mother Kathy Amaya, who lives in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, said today she has been waiting to see her son, David Amaya Barrick, 37, since learning on October 31 that border agents had picked him up but released him after they discovered he was a U.S. citizen trying to get home. She said she has been looking for her child ever since her estranged husband abducted him and though she knew he was in Mexico, she did not have the money to hire a private investigator. David was raised by his grandparents and does not speak any English. He had no idea his mother had been looking for him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Soon to be reunited: David Amaya Barrick was raised my his grandparents and does not speak any English. He had no idea his mother had been looking for him . Proof: When he was caught sneaking over the border from Mexico, immigration did not believe he was an American citizen until they later found his birth certificate . He told NBC7 through an interpreter: 'My father told me my mother had left me abandoned and orphaned. I don’t know my mother, and I find out she’s been looking for me for 30 years, and I have the longing to meet her for the first time.' Barrick was rounded up with a group of illegal border crossers on October 30 in a canyon about a mile from a San Diego beach, but he explained that he was born in the US and had a right to be there. Overjoyed: David Amaya's mother Kathy has been looking for her son for 30 years . Though they did not believe him at first, border agents later verified his story. They then contacted Kathy Amaya to let her know that her son had turned up and wanted to return to her. 'They told me he was beaten and robbed before he crossed the border and the thieves took his money and his cell (phone),' Amaya said. 'They said he seemed like a really good guy, and that he only speaks Spanish and I don't.' Barrick was born in Chicago in 1977 while Amaya was married to his father, but she said her spouse became abusive and the couple split when the boy was one-years-old. After some time had passed, Amaya began letting the father visit his son and 'then one day (the child) was just gone', she said. 'I reported his abduction, but when police found out he was with his dad, they weren't worried about it.' Amaya said the boy's father told her . that he had taken the toddler, then two years of age, to Mexico and left . him there with family members. His father and aunt took David to . Mexico under a one-month permit to visit his grandparents. However, he told NBC7 his father left him there and he has only seen him a few times in the last 30 years. Iglesia de Cristo Ministerios Llamada . Final Inc de San Diego, based in Point Loma, is providing food and . shelter for David as the ministry tries to raise the funds to get him to . Wisconsin so he can see his mother and half siblings. Future: David Amaya is focusing on learning English and playing the drums so he can be a better musician, but his immediate goal is to meet his mom . Kathy Amaya told NBC7 that David has four siblings, and she’s excited to have the family reunited. 'He just told me that he doesn't hold anything against me,' she added. 'So that makes me happy.' David finished high school in Mexico and studied music in Monterrey, Mexico. He plays drums and went on tour with a band. He is focusing on learning English and continuing his career as a musician - as soon as he meets his mother of course. var nbcLP={};nbcLP.aRandomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*10000);nbcLP.currentPageLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);nbcLP.currentSiteLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.host);nbcLP.defaultWidth=652;nbcLP.defaultHeight=367;nbcLP.cmsID=""231513771"";nbcLP.vidPid=""DnSF8QztpgRx"";nbcLP.vidSec=""news"";nbcLP.vidSubSec=""local"";nbcLP.vidFrame=document.getElementById(""nbcLP231513771"");nbcLP.vidFrame.style.border=""none"";nbcLP.vidFrame.width=nbcLP.defaultWidth;nbcLP.vidFrame.height=nbcLP.defaultHeight;nbcLP.vidFrame.scrolling=""no"";nbcLP.vidFrame.src=""http://www.nbcsandiego.com/templates/nbc_partner_player?cmsID=""+nbcLP.cmsID+""&videoID=""+nbcLP.vidPid+""&width=""+nbcLP.defaultWidth+""&height=""+nbcLP.defaultHeight+""&sec=""+nbcLP.vidSec+""&subsec=""+nbcLP.vidSubSec+""&turl=""+nbcLP.currentSiteLoc+""&ourl=""+nbcLP.currentPageLoc+""&rand=""+nbcLP.aRandomNumber; .","David Amaya Barrick thought his mother had abandoned him .

I wish he was dead' On Monday, Bessey denied having anything to do with the shooting but admitted she did at one time say, 'I was fed up. I just wanted it to be done. I just said it. I wish he was dead', but explained it was because she was tired of him and the divorce. She referred to one incident in May 2012 when he took his 'fist to her face' after she asked about grocery money. 'He took his fist to my face. He took his knee to my rib,' Bessey testified. 'I grabbed my purse and walked out the door.' She admitted there was a gun in her purse and she could have killed him if she wanted to. Last week during his testimony, Robert Bessey described the same fight as, 'I was in bed. Amy came in. There was pushing and hitting. I pushed her. She hit me,' ABC reports. Amy Bessey testified she thought they could save their relationship. That was until Robert Bessey pointed a gun at her and Michael Bessey . upon their return from Texas. Her son Michael is also accused of attempted murder. The 43-year-old faces eight charges, including . solicitation to commit murder, conspiracy and attempted murder with use . of a deadly weapon. If convicted, she could face two to 91 years in . prison. Victim: Richard Bessey, pictured in court last week, survived the attempt on his life and testified in his ex-wife's trial . In the Las Vegas justice court last week, Martinez read out a text message Richard Pearson, 39, sent Bessey prior to the assassination attempt, which said, 'I love it when a plan comes together.' Accused: Amy Bessey, 43, allegedly plotted to kill her husband for his life insurance policy . 'That ladies and gentlemen is a text . message sent by Ric Pearson to his sister, the defendant, Amy Bessey, . approximately six hours prior to Robert Bessey being shot in the head,' Martinez told jurors. Bessey survived the attempt on his life and testified in his ex-wife's trial. He said he was driving his usual route to work at 4:35am November 14 when a gunshot came from a gold SUV. 'I felt a hot sensation here and towards the back of my neck. I start feeling what I believe to be a bullet,' Bessey told the court. 'This is my sweatshirt. You can see the hole in the neck.' The couple had been married for 18 years and had three kids together. They each had two children from prior relationships and Bessey adopted Amy Bessey's biological son Michael two years after they were married. Robert Bessey also testified Wednesday that Michael had been pulling away from him to be closer to his wife after he returned from the military months before the shooting. Bessey said Michael's move back into the home after he was dishonorably discharged caused friction between him and his wife. He said he noticed Michael's relationship with his mother had changed. 'They seemed to be closer or adult conversation, rather than mother-son,' Bessey testified. Prosecutors also showed the court gas station surveillance video that captured Bessey's brother and son not far from the scene of the shooting in a gold SUV that police say was tied to the incident. Co-conspirators: Her adopted son, Michael Bessey, left, and her brother, Richard Pearson, allegedly carried out the attempted murder last year. Amy Bessey allegedly has an 'unnatural relationship' with her son .

Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. Michael . Bessey and Pearson . were charged in the murder plot last year, but police only implicated . Amy Bessey in January after her son told his cellmate that she had been . involved. She was arrested by Las Vegas police . on charges of attempted murder, battery and conspiracy to commit murder . against her husband, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Robert . Bessey told detectives that his wife and son's 'close' relationship had . prompted the divorce, while Michael Bessey's ex-girlfriend said Amy was . also the reason they had broken up. Relatives claimed the pair had an 'unnatural relationship' and one friend said they would go to nightclubs together and 'grab each other's buttocks', police said. Plot: Michael Bessey, pictured brandishing a gun on his Facebook page, allegedly told his cellmate that he shot his father to get money from his life insurance plan so he could buy a truck . 'Close': Michael Bessey, left, allegedly wrote his mother, right, a letter from jail saying: 'I miss touching you' Robert Bessey also told police that . he had read a letter his son had written to his wife from jail which . said: 'I miss touching you'. But Amy Bessey was only implicated in the gruesome plot when her son's cellmate, Tremel Palmer, claimed he told him that the three planned the killing and were shocked Mr Bessey survived. Michael Bessey allegedly told Palmer that he was the one who had fired the bullet. He and Pearson then went to a diner for Amy Bessey to collect them, he allegedly said. Michael Bessey added that he expected to receive a total of $400,000 from the death, with which he would buy a truck, while his mother would pay off her mortgage, police said. Bessey said he wanted his father dead because he had physically abused his mother and mentally abused the family, the Journal-Review reported. He added that he planned to blame the . plot on his uncle, Richard Pearson, who recently finished a prison . sentence, by claiming the man had forced him to get involved at . gunpoint. In an eerie twist following the shooting, Amy Pearson cooperated with police and handed over her brother and her son to police by identifying them in a video taken at a gas station near the scene. After her son was arrested last November, she told the Review-Journal: 'I have no idea what's going on. I wish I did.' Michael Bessey, Richard Pearson and Amy Pearson have all been charged with attempted murder with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit murder and battery with a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm. Richard Pearson was also charged with violation of parole. Their trial is scheduled for February 2014.

"Ministers are being provided with thumbprint-activated smartphones to replace the traditional red box. For over 150 years, ministers have carried the scarlet leather cases crammed with documents their civil servants need them to read, and decisions they need to sign off. But now they are being issued with state-of-the-art iPhones, enabling them to do their work online. David Cameron wants to replace the traditional red boxes used by Government ministers with smart phones . The innovation is being introduced across government by Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, who has become an early adopter of the modern phones. Use of the smart phones will not be compulsory, but Mr Maude said many ministers will prefer to carry an iPhone in their pocket rather than ‘lugging’ their red box around. The red box is most commonly seen on Budget Day, when the Chancellor holds it aloft on the stairs of No 11 Downing Street. They came under attack four years ago when it was revealed that although incoming Coalition ministers were being encouraged to take public transport, their red boxes were being driven home in air conditioned ministerial cars because of the sensitive nature of the documents they contain. With documents now being viewed in electronic rather than paper format, many see the red box as having had their day. One such politician is Mr Maude, who has been Cabinet Office minister – in charge of civil service reform – throughout the time of the Coalition. He has announced plans to step down as an MP at the election. Francis Maude (right), the Cabinet Office minister, is pushnig the use of finger-print activated smart phones across government . Unveiling his new phone, the minister said: ‘All my work emails are on this. This is my red box. ‘In the car on the way back I will be able to deal with two or three submissions just like that. ‘Whereas with the old BlackBerry, there were endless different passwords to get into it, with this – a modern iPhone, opens up with a thumb print. You go into email, first thing that comes up is two Parliamentary questions for me to check – I can do that quickly, it’s done. I can do it from anywhere. ‘The cost of this technology is infinitely cheaper that what it has replaced, and its infinitely better.’ Mr Maude said ministers in the Cabinet Office were already using the iPhones instead of red boxes, as are ministers in Sajid Javid’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport. George Osborne posed with the most famous red box in  Government 2010 - the briefcase used by former Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone . He said he hoped that other departments would take up the new scheme and eventually phase out their reliance on red boxes. ‘It’ll vary. All ministers have different ways of working – so we need to adapt to it differently. ‘Different ministers will work in different ways; some ministers will still want a red box and others will breathe a sigh of relief about not having to lug the bloody thing around. They’ll be much happier with an iPhone in a pocket.’ Mr Maude said that if material was of a very sensitive nature, it would not be viewed on the iPhone. It would instead be looked at on paper back in the Cabinet Office, which has an office on Whitehall. ‘If I have to see cybersecurity-type stuff, very high levels of security-type stuff, it’s better to have one place in the Cabinet Office and I can view it there.’ The most famous red box of all, the Budget box, contains the speech the Chancellor is about to make, although on one occasion Norman Lamont used it to hold a half bottle of whisky for him to drink at the despatch box. Traditionally, Gladstone’s battered budget box from 1860 was carried, but wear and tear means a newer one is now used for the Downing Street photo opportunity. In late 2010, Michael Gove’s wife Sarah Vine revealed that ministers’ red boxes followed them in ‘air-conditioned splendour’ a chauffeur-driven limo. In May, soon after taking office, the Coalition published a new ministerial code which said ministers should use public transport, where practicable. But within weeks it became clear that the situation was not all it seemed. Miss Vine, the wife of the then Education Secretary, revealed: ‘The red box arrives unannounced at all hours in a chauffeur-driven car, the engine purring deferentially as her handler walks her to the front door. ‘My husband is free to travel home by Tube, taxi, bicycle or carrier pigeon, but the RB must arrive in air-conditioned splendour, snug and secure in the back of a locked car.'","EXCLUSIVE: Ministers issued with state-of-the-art iPhones to work online .

"A baby girl born weighing less than a bunch of grapes has returned home - two weeks before her due date. Tiny Lily-Mae weighed just 1lb 11oz when she was born three months early at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital  in March. Doctors warned her mother Sarah Underwood, 38, that her baby could spend months in intensive care due to breathing problems caused by her early arrival. But after . two months in hospital she was strong enough to return home to . Longlevens, Gloucestershire - 16 days before she was due to be born. Tiny Lily-Mae, pictured holding one of her parents' hands, weighed just 1lb 11oz when she was born three months early in March . Her proud father Mark Davies, a builder, has told of his relief after Lily-Mae was allowed to return home following a 'terrifying' couple of months. He said: 'When she was born I was scared to touch her, she looked so fragile, I didn’t want to hurt her. 'It was so frightening to see her in the incubator so tiny. In all honesty we were expecting the worst. 'She was just so little and she was three months premature - the odds weren’t in her favour. 'It was very scary to see her so small with all of these tubes and wires attached to her. 'Thankfully the doctors were quite positive about it and everyone was very helpful and reassuring.' Lily-Mae, pictured left, was born weighing just 1lbs 11oz, more than 6lbs below the average baby weight of 7lbs 5oz. She is pictured right with her parents Mark Davies and Sarah Underwood . Sarah Underwood, pictured cradling Lily-Mae, gave birth by c-section on March 20, despite not being due until June 13. She was born at 27 weeks - just three weeks after the legal abortion limit . Ms Underwood, an admin clerical assistant, had been at work when she knocked her leg on a cardboard box and they became unusually swollen. She put it down to being pregnant but her boss persuaded her to see her doctor, who referred her straight to hospital after taking her blood pressure. After a number of blood tests she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, a condition that raises blood pressure and can only be cured by giving birth. She was . injected with steroids to strengthen her unborn baby’s lungs and gave . birth by C-section on March 20, despite not being due until June 13. Lily-Mae was born weighing just 1lbs 11oz, more than 6lbs below the average baby weight of 7lbs 5oz. Surrounded by tubes and wires, Lily-Mae spent two months in hospital, an experience her father Mark Davies described as 'terrifying' Lily-Mae had to spend two months in intensive care due to breathing problems caused by her early arrival . She was born at 27 weeks - just three weeks after the legal abortion limit. After . weeks in both intensive care and the nursery at Gloucestershire Royal . Hospital, Lily-Mae was allowed to return home on May 28. Mr Davies told of his relief at being able to start a normal family life, even if the couple were not prepared for the early arrival. He said: 'We had lots of people coming in to talk to us all the time. 'They told . us that it would be extremely dangerous for the pregnancy to continue . but I don’t think we thought it was as serious as it actually was. 'Then when she was born we realised we literally had nothing for her - she was so early we hadn’t prepared. After weeks in both intensive care and the nursery at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital hospital, Lily-Mae was allowed to return home to parents Mark Davies and Sarah Underwood, pictured, on May 28 . Lily-Mae has built up her strength and now weighs more than 5lbs . 'She’s doing really well now. She weighs 5lb 4oz already, but that’s still only really what most newborns weigh. 'It’s so nice to have her home, now we can be with her 24/7 and be a proper family.' Mr Davies is now planning a sponsored bike ride in an attempt to raise £1,000 for the ward that helped his daughter. He said: 'I wanted to do something to give back to the hospital. It is a way of saying thank you to the hospital and the staff for keeping our baby alive.'

"Driver: Marian Guerrido, 23, managed to get out of the car safely before it plunged into the pond . Two children have died and three are in a critical condition after their unlicensed mother lost control of the family car and drove it into a pond  in suburban Minneapolis. The Minnesota State Patrol identified the children as Aliyana Rennie, one; Zenavia Rennie, five; Amani Coleman-Guerrido, five; Zarihana Rennie, six; and Alarious Coleman-Guerrido, seven. Rescuers worked frantically to free the children after their family car veered off a highway ramp and into the frigid pond shortly after 6am Thursday. The car was underwater for up to 45 minutes after Thursday's crash. St. Louis Park city spokesman Jamie Zwilling said the children were unconscious and unresponsive when pulled from the vehicle. Zenavia Rennie of Brooklyn Center, was pronounced dead at around 7.30pm Thursday. An attorney acting as the family spokesman told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that Alarious Coleman-Guerrido passed away before 10pm at Hennepin County Medical Center. The driver, Marion Guerrido, 23, of Brooklyn Center, escaped from the four-door 1998 Pontiac Grand Am sedan and was unhurt. Still in a critical condition are Amani Coleman-Guerrido, Zarihanna Rennie and Aliyana Rennie. Three of the children are Guerrido’s - Alarious, who died; Amani, and baby Aliyana. Aliyana’s father, Julius Rennie, is Guerrido’s boyfriend. Zenavia was Rennie’s daughter, as are Zarihana and Aliyana. One witness described seeing her in the pond, screaming for help. ‘The car was under water, and she must have been standing on top,' Jeff Robertson told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. ‘That pond is 8 or 9 feet deep, and the water was at her knees.’ Scroll down for video . Tragic loss: Zenavia Rennie, 5 (left), and her stepbrother Alarious M. Coleman-Guerrido, 7 (right), have died after being rescued from the frigid pond . The children could not be rescued until the car was towed out of the water and police could reach the doors. Passersby attempted to rescue the children before police arrived, but the 1998 Pontiac Grand Am was submerged in cold water. The . cold water came up to the neck of one would-be rescuer who stood on the . roof of the four-door sedan, said Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Eric . Roeske. St Louis Park spokesman Jamie Zwilling said Miss Guerrido, of Brooklyn Center, escaped . the car when it hit the water, but the first child was pulled out of . the car after 25 minutes, the last after 45 minutes, Minnesota State . Patrol confirmed. The pond was near freezing, police said. Cause: A police officer investigates the scene where a car carrying six people careered into a holding pond just after 6am on Thursday November 21 . Passengers: Authorities say five children were . trapped in the car underwater for about 20 minutes and are said to be . unresponsive . Four of the five children, including . the two deceased, attended the Odyssey Academy, where little Zenavia had . recently been named a star student. Teacher Laura Montrey told MyFox9 that the kids' mother was very involved with her brood's education. The crash happened about 6:16am at the . junction of Highways 7 and 100 in St Louis Park, a western Minneapolis . suburb. It is not yet known how fast the car - a green Pontiac Grand Am - . was going. Lt Eric Roeske said the car veered . left off a ramp and plunged down a slope into the pond about 40 to 50 . yards from the roadway. There is no guardrail between the road and the . pond. Tragedy: The community is mourning the loss of Alarious Coleman-Guerrido (pictured) and Zenavia Rennie . He told the Star Tribune the car landed in water that was 'quite deep', an estimated eight to nine feet, and was 'incredibly cold'. 'A passerby who jumped in the water was standing on the roof of the vehicle and the water was up to his neck,' Roeske said. All victims were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center and the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children’s Hospital. Asked to comment on whether the crash could have been intentional, Roeske said they were planning to fully investigate the incident, but there was no immediate information that would indicate the crash had happened on purpose. Police say they are still looking into how the kids all fit in the four-door sedan and if any of them were wearing seat belts. The officers and firefighters who jumped into the water have revealed that they had to use their feet to pull the kids out of the car . Crash: The children were not able to be rescued from the car until it was towed out of the water . The city fire department and the Hennepin County dive team worked to get the car out. she said it wasn't clear whether speed was a factor in the crash. The road was wet from light mist, but not icy, he said. Jeffrey Robertson, who lives in an apartment building close to the pond, said he heard a woman screaming as he was watching the morning news on TV. He ran onto his second-floor balcony and saw a woman standing in water that was up to her knees, he told the Star Tribune. He then called 911 before running out to help the woman.","Marian Guerrido drove into a pond early Thursday morning with five children in her car .

"Once one of England’s most majestic country houses, the future of this historic hall looks grim as vital restoration costs reach £35million. Grand plans for the 180-year-old Trentham Hall, in Trentham Gardens near Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire are at a standstill because of the latest economic recession, leaving them to decay after they were named on English Heritage’s ‘at risk’ register. Planning permission to turn the dilapidated building into a conference hotel has been given the green light but the cost of repairs are too high for developer St Modwen. Scroll down for video . Doomed to disappear: What remains of 180-year-old Trentham Hall is at risk of falling into ruin after developers say £35million restoration costs are too much to make it viable . What it once was: The Trentham Estate was a spectacular sight, with several buildings and extensive gardens including a large Elizabethan house in 1630s which it is thought to have been demolished during the construction of the Georgian estate . Many millions of pounds have been spent on the estate since it was bought by St Modwen in 1996, when it was in such a state that both the buildings and extensive gardens were derelict and vandalised. Mike Herbert, the North Staffordshire regional director at St Modwen, said that much money had been spent in maintaining the site from further deterioration. After a restoration of the gardens in 2003, the estate was re-opened in 2004 and now attracts some three million visitors every year. He said of the Grade II-listed buildings: ‘We have planning approvals for the restoration of Trentham Hall but the cost of doing so is significantly greater than its current value. Plans to develop the buildings of Trentham Hall are at a standstill after developer St Modwen says £35m restoration costs are too expensive to build the planned conference hotel . Grade II-listed heritage: Dr Simon Thurley, from English Heritage said of Trentham Hall: 'Grade II-listed buildings are the bulk of the nation's heritage treasury so when one of them is lost, it is as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past' Garden's revival: While some of the buildings languish, the spectacular gardens were recently refurbished and replanted with thousands of plants and flowers to return it to its former glory . Costly country views: Many millions of pounds have been spent on the estate since it was bought by St Modwen in 1996, when it was in such a state that both the buildings and extensive gardens were derelict and vandalised . ‘To restore and rebuild it would cost around £30-£35million, but the current value as a hotel is well below that. Therefore, it is just not economically viable in the current economy. 'Developing the hall was planned for five to ten years after we started the restoration but we have had somewhat of a recession in the last few years and this has delayed the plans completely. 'We are looking to see if there are ways of making the scheme work financially. The plan of a major conference centre is particularly expensive and difficult to market. 'We are committed to bringing the hall back to life, it's just a question of when we can make the numbers work.' Grand plans: Sir Charles Barry spent more than 10 years, making improvements to the house adding a new block with state bedrooms complete with dressing rooms and its own servants' quarters as well as the sculpture gallery and the clock tower . Demolition: The lake in the estate became polluted by sewage from local potteries around the 1900s and it was offered for free to the local councils in 1905 but by 1907 it stood abandoned and so the bulk of the estate was demolished in 1912 . Mr Herbert said a recent report from the local council into the estate found that 'great progress' had been made in the restoration work so far. Dr Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said: ‘Grade II-listed buildings are the bulk of the nation's heritage treasury so when one of them is lost, it is as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past. ‘Something that made the area special will have gone. But now, with the economic climate putting more pressure than ever on these buildings, it is time to plug the one remaining gap.’ Trentham in 1937: The earliest record of Trentham Hall dates back to 1086 and since then it has been home to many prominent people including the Duke of Suffolk, Sir Thomas Pope, Earl Gower and the Dukes of Sutherland until it was abandoned in 1905 . Once one of England's grandest: A drawing of the terrace in the extensive gardens which were once tended by up to 50 gardeners . Historic house: The earliest record of Trentham Hall dates back to 1086 and since then it has been home to many prominent people including the Duke of Suffolk, Earl Gower and the Dukes of Sutherland until it was abandoned in 1905 . Punt for a time: The river was diverted to flow into a lake in the gardens but it became a blight on the beautiful estate when it became polluted by sewage from local potteries around the 1900s . Garden reinvention: The gardens were once tended by up to 50 gardeners and they are still maintained by a huge staff after they were revived by award-winning designer Tom Stuart-Smith . Time takes its toll: A sculpture gallery and a 100ft clock tower (pictured) are among the buildings which remain after the main hall was demolished . The spectacular and vast gardens were . once tended by up to 50 gardeners and were recently refurbished and . replanted with thousands of plants and flowers to return it to its . former glory. It is still maintained by a huge staff and is seen by many . visitors especially in spring and summer. The famous Italian Gardens were revived by award-winning designer Tom Stuart-Smith.

A sculpture gallery, the 100ft clock . tower, parish church are among the buildings which remain after the main . hall was demolished in 1913. The site was originally an Augustinian Priory and then a convent. In the 1630s a large Elizabethan house was built but is thought to have been demolished to make way for the construction of the Georgian Trentham Hall. The house was dramatically renovated by famous architect Sir Charles Barry during the mid-1830s, at the same time he was working on the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament. He was commissioned by the second Duke of Sutherland to make the house grander in order to show off his wealth as the largest landowner in Britain at the time. For more than 10 years, Sir Barry made improvements to the house adding a new block with state bedrooms complete with dressing rooms and its own servants’ quarters as well as the sculpture gallery and the clock tower. New family quarters and a grand main entrance displaying the family coat of arms as well as life-size wolves were also built. Even the River Trent was incorporated into the estate’s design. The river was diverted to flow into a lake in the extensive garden. But the lake became a blight on the beautiful estate when it became polluted by sewage from local potteries around the 1900s. Such a disfigurement on the estate, it was offered for free to the County of Staffordshire and the Borough of Stoke-on-Trent in 1905 but by 1907 it stood abandoned and so the bulk of the estate was demolished in 1912.

Amani Coleman-Guerrido, five-years-old, and Aliyana Rennie, one-year-old, luckily survived a crash that killed two of their siblings, and now they are awake and able to recognize the voices of family members again. 'They’re showing signs of being responsive. They recognize mom’s voice, grandma’s voice,' a family friend told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Scroll down for video . Shaniece Thompson, 25, said the horrifying news of the tragic incident lead her to give birth on to a 3lb baby - Dream - on the same day that her five-year-old daughter Zenavia Rennie died in the accident . Another child, 6-year-old Zarihana Rennie, continues to battle for life and is listed in extremely critical condition following Thursday morning's incident. She remains unresponsive. Funeral arrangements are being planned for two other siblings who died from drowning. Mother Shaniece . Thompson, 25, said the horrifying news of the tragic incident led her . to give birth on to a 3lb baby - also a daughter - on the same day that . five-year-old Zenavia Rennie died in the accident. Her son Alarious Coleman-Guerrido, seven, died in the crash from complications of drowning. Thompson, . who was only 32 weeks pregnant at the time, has named the newborn child . Dream and she is currently in neo-natal intensive care. Thompson’s daughters were amongst a group of five children trapped in the submerged car that was driven into an icy lake by unlicensed driver Marion Guerrido, 23. She is the mother of the other three children in the car and is also the girlfriend of Julius Rennie, the father of Thompson’s children. Thompson told CBS Minnesota that she has a lot of questions about the incident that she wants to ask Guerrido. Marion Guerrido, right, was the unlicensed driver of the car which ended up in a pond in Minneapolis killing two young children, including Zarihana Rennie, left . The officers and firefighters who jumped into the water have revealed that they had to use their feet to pull the kids out of the car . 'I’m angry about the fact she was driving without a license. I’m angry at the fact she put all those kids in a small car,' Thompson said. Rescuers . worked frantically to try and free the children after their vehicle . veered off a highway ramp and into the frigid pond shortly after 6am on . Thursday. The car was underwater for up to 45 minutes after the crash. St. Louis Park city spokesman Jamie Zwilling said the children were unconscious and unresponsive when pulled from the vehicle. Zenavia Rennie of Brooklyn Center, was pronounced dead at around 7.30pm Thursday. An attorney acting as the family spokesman told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that Alarious Coleman-Guerrido passed away before 10pm at Hennepin County Medical Center. The driver, Marion Guerrido, 23, of Brooklyn Center, escaped from the four-door 1998 Pontiac Grand Am sedan and was unhurt. One witness described seeing her in the pond, screaming for help. ‘The car was under water, and she must have been standing on top,' Jeff Robertson told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. ‘That pond is 8 or 9 feet deep, and the water was at her knees.’ Tragic loss: Alarious Coleman-Guerrido, 7 (both photos), died from complications from drowning after being rescued from the freezing pond . Shaniece Thompson, center, has said she has a lot of questions for Marion Guerrido who was driving the vehicle which included her two daughters, one of whom is now dead and other remains in an extremely critical condition . The officers and firefighters who jumped into the water have revealed that they had to use their feet to pull the kids out of the car. 'I've been doing this a long time - 35 years and I've been involved in a lot of rescues. Never seen anything like that before,' paramedic Randy Elledge told MyFox9. Firefighters in special suits that make them float first had to bring the driver, Guerrido, and a Good Samaritan to shore before Tim Smith with the St. Louis Park Fire Department started sweeping the inside of the car with his feet. ‘It was frustrating not being able to access the inside of the compartment and not being able to get in there and do what we could do with our hands,’ Smith said. They pulled out three of the children through an open driver's side window and two more through back windows that Smith broke, then they carried the children to shore where paramedics were waiting to perform CPR. Cause: A police officer investigates the scene where a car carrying six people careered into a holding pond just after 6am on Thursday November 21 . Authorities say the five children were . trapped underwater in the car for about 20 minutes in freezing water on Thursday morning . Four of the five children, including . the two deceased, attended the Odyssey Academy, where little Zenavia had . recently been named a star student. The crash happened about 6:15 am at the . junction of Highways 7 and 100 in St Louis Park, a western Minneapolis . suburb. It is not yet known how fast the car - a green Pontiac Grand Am - . was going. Lt Eric Roeske said the car veered . left off a ramp and plunged down a slope into the pond about 40 to 50 . yards from the roadway. There is no guardrail between the road and the . pond. He told the Star Tribune the car landed in water that was 'quite deep', an estimated eight to nine feet, and was 'incredibly cold'. 'A passerby who jumped in the water was standing on the roof of the vehicle and the water was up to his neck,' Roeske said. All victims were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center and the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children’s Hospital. Asked to comment on whether the crash could have been intentional, Roeske said they were planning to fully investigate the incident, but there was no immediate information that would indicate the crash had happened on purpose. Police say they are still looking into how the kids could ll fit in the four-door sedan and if any of them were wearing seat belts. Video: Mother of drowning victim goes into premature labor .

"Crushed: Hope Fennell, 13, died after being hit by a truck driven by a man who was texting moments before the accident . A lorry driver has been jailed for just six months for running over a schoolgirl seconds after texting his girlfriend – and deleting the messages as she lay dying under his wheels. Darren Foster, 38, crushed Hope Fennell with his 18-ton truck as she cycled over a pedestrian crossing on her way home from school in November 2011. But instead of rushing to the 13-year-old’s aid, he deleted messages to hide the evidence that he had been distracted at the wheel. The girl’s devastated family are furious at the sentence, saying Hope’s killer has not been properly punished for driving his truck into their child like a ‘lethal weapon’ and then callously trying to cover his tracks. ‘She was mangled under the wheels and he got back in the cab and deleted those texts,’ her mother Nazan said. He was only thinking about himself. I don’t know if I will recover from this. I’m devastated.’ Hope, who was a pupil at Queensbridge School, died on Kings Heath High Street, Birmingham, at 5pm on November 7. In the minutes before the crash, Foster, who was delivering his final load of the day, had been sending texts to his girlfriend while driving at up to 55mph. As Hope crossed the road, he pulled away at a green light and did not see the teenager riding out in front of him. Jailed: Lorry driver Darren Foster was sentenced to six months in jail for dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice . Foster got out of the vehicle and saw Hope trapped under the wheels of the truck. But, . worried that his text messages would be used as evidence against him, . he climbed back into his cab to delete them as she was dying. At Birmingham Crown Court, Foster was . told he will serve just three months of a six-month sentence for . dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice. He had earlier . pleaded guilty to the offences. Judge . Andrew Menary, QC, said Foster was not to blame for Hope’s death . because he could not have seen her as she moved on to the road. Had his . poor driving caused her death, Foster would be looking at ‘years and not . months’, he added. Mrs . Fennell said Foster should have faced a manslaughter charge. ‘He was on . the phone while driving something lethal, which he knew had got the . potential to kill,’ she said. ‘He made that choice. 'It’s like picking up a gun. Hope didn’t stand a chance. ‘The fact he was not charged with Hope’s death after he tried to pervert the course of justice shows the system is not right.’ Mrs . Fennell, who used to work as a counsellor for drug addicts, added: ‘I . don’t have a family left. I live in a haze, I live in denial that she’ll . come back home. I used to work. I can’t do it any more. I don’t go out . of my house.’ Ben Gow, . prosecuting, said police compared Foster’s telephone billing history . with recordings from his lorry’s tachograph, and found he travelled at . speeds of 55mph while sending or reading at least 11 text messages in . the 20 minutes before the tragedy. Richard Murray, defending, said Foster had been a driver for 20 years and had a clean record. He claimed that the teenager’s death had caused the lorry driver to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Devastated by charge: Hope's mother Nazan said Foster turned his 18-tonne truck into a 'lethal weapon' by sending text messages while driving 55mph on Birmingham roads and says he should have been charged with manslaughter .

"ABC anchor Amy Robach was surrounded by her family as she left Good Morning America on Monday with a brave smile after revealing she has breast cancer and will undergo a double mastectomy on Thursday. The 40-year-old was given her shocking diagnosis after being asked by the producer of the show in September if she would take a mammogram live on air to raise awareness for breast cancer for their 'GMA Goes Pink' day. She reluctantly agreed - and it was a decision that saved her life. She tweeted on Monday: 'Gratitude.. For all who have written, tweeted, called, kept me in their prayers. Spread the word, save lives.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Support: Amy Robach, her husband Andrew Shue and her daughters, Ava McIntosh and Annie McIntosh were seen heading to Madison Square Park after she announced live on air she has breast cancer - which has now spread to her second sentinel lymph node . Ms Robach was seen heading to Madison Square Park on Monday with her husband Andrew Shue and her young daughters, Ava . McIntosh and Annie McIntosh. The 40-year-old is scheduled to undergo a double mastectomy on Thursday. Her fellow presenters tweeted their love and support for the presenter. Today show co-anchor Matt Lauer posted: 'We want to send her our love and support, and tell her we are thinking of her & her family.' NBC's Andrea Mitchell tweeted: 'Brave statement frm our friend former colleague @arobach.' TV . personality Bill Rancic, whose wife Giuliana had a double mastectomy . after discovering she had breast cancer in 2011, applauded Ms Robach's courage during an interview with GMA today. He said: 'I applaud Amy for her bravery. She chose the harder path and she did it for a reason. She's using her platform wisely. It's not easy. 'We've been through it. It's a lot easier to just go quietly and cry in the closet and not let anyone know. The fact that she's doing this, she is going to save lives.' On October 1, in front of millions of people, Robach took her mammogram, breathing a sigh of relief when it was over. Sad news: Amy Robach, 40, announced on GMA that she has breast cancer and needed to undergo a double mastectomy . Breast cancer: Amy received an on-air mammogram on October 1 (pictured above), after realizing she is the age when she should be getting tested regularly but had been putting it off because she was busy with work and her family . Famous friends: Amy with her husband, Melrose Place actor Andrew Shue, left, and Grant Show, right . She . remembered Robin Roberts - herself a breast cancer survivor - telling . her: 'If you get the mammogram and it saves just one life then it's all . worth it.' Little did she know the life she would be saving would be her own. A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast which is used to check for cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It allows the doctor to have a closer look for changes in breast tissue that cannot be felt during a breast exam. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer in women aged 40 to 70. Mammograms have been controversial and some women have been reluctant to go through with the screening. Potential harm includes false-negative results, false-positive results, over-diagnosis, over-treatment, and radiation exposure. During a mammogram, your breasts are placed between an x-ray plate and a plastic plate which are then attached to the x-ray machine before the breasts are flattened. This spreads the breast tissue out to obtain a clearer picture. Pressure will be felt on the breast for a few seconds and there might be some discomfort but this will only last a few seconds. The whole procedure from start to finish lasts for 20 minutes. A few weeks later, she was asked to come back to the doctors and was so unconcerned, she didn't even bring anyone with her. 'I thought I was going back in for a . few follow-up images, only to find out in a matter of hours that I had . breast cancer,' Amy wrote on her ABC blog. 'I was alone that afternoon, never thinking to bring anyone with me, never thinking that day would be life-altering. 'My . husband was on a business trip and my parents live across the country, . but that night everyone flew into New York City and we started gearing . up for a fight.' She spoke on GMA this morning about . the experience and how it has affected her and her family. 'Robin Roberts and ABC saved my life by telling me to go into that van for a mammogram. 'When I was asked, I want to say I was happy to do my part but honestly I was a little reluctant at first. I'd been asked to do it on air to demystify it for women who might be nervous. 'I'm 40 and I had been putting it off for a number of years - between flying all over the world for work and running around with my kids to school, ballet and gymnastics. Like so many women I just kept pushing it off. 'Telling my children was the toughest part and yesterday I had to tell my grandmother - who is not in the best of health. 'I have to be strong now for other people because I am about to break their hearts.' By her side: Amy Robach's husband Andrew Shue was there at the ABC studios to support his wife as she made the heartbreaking announcement . Alone: Amy said she did not even bring her husband Andrew to the second appointment with the doctor because she thought it was nothing . Family: Amy said she is being strong for her children because she realizes telling them she has cancer will break their hearts . Driving force: Robach, 40, chose the most aggressive form of treatment- a double mastectomy- because she has young children and much to live for, saying she didn't want the chance of a second bout hanging over her . She wrote on her blog: 'On Thursday, November 14, I will go into surgery where my doctors will perform a bilateral mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery. 'Only then will I know more about what that fight will fully entail, but I am mentally and physically as prepared as anyone can be in this situation. 'And while everyone who gets cancer is clearly unlucky, I got lucky by catching it early, and there are so many people to thank for making sure I did. 'Every producer, every person who urged me to do this, changed my trajectory. The doctors told me bluntly: ""That mammogram just saved your life"".' Amy married her second husband - Melrose Place actor Andrew Shue - in 2010 after meeting him at a book party. She has two daughters to her first husband Tim McIntosh, who she divorced in 2009. Before she moved to ABC, Amy was the Today show weekend host. She left NBC in May 2012. Robin Roberts returned to GMA in February this year, left, still sporting a bald head from chemotherapy and right, back to her usual self at the Country Music Awards last week . Together again: Roberts introduced the show and grinned alongside her fellow GMA hosts in February . Robin Roberts recently returned to Good Morning America after her own battle with breast cancer. She was first diagnosed in 2007 after discovering a lump during a self-examination. She also made the brave decision to announce her illness on air. What followed was a partial mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation until she finally got the all clear. Then in 2012, she was diagnosed with MDS or myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disease of the blood and bone marrow which was once known as pre-leukemia. Be the Match Registry, a nonprofit organization run by the National Marrow Donor Program, experienced a 1,800 per cent spike in donors the day Roberts went public with her illness. She took a leave from GMA to get a bone marrow transplant in October 2012 but her recovery was documented on the morning show before she returned to GMA on February 20 of this year.

"A college basketball contest was repeatedly delayed Saturday by - of all things - a swooping bat that inexplicably gained entree into the arena and then again-and-again dive-bombed the court. Pandemonium erupted at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin during the game's second half after the flying critter emerged from the building's rafters and reportedly proceeded to harry panicked players and coaches with repeated kamikaze-like swoops. 'It's coming back! It's coming back!' a fan can be overheard exclaiming to a pal on a widely-circulated YouTube video of the incident. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Unexpected guest: A college basketball game in Milwaukee was repeatedly delayed Saturday by - of all things - a bat . Numerous Delays: The game between Marquette University and Providence College was halted with 11 minutes and 23 seconds left in the contest's second half . Aging arena: The bat inexplicably gained access to the BMO Harris Bradley Center in downtown Milwaukee, where the NBA Bucks also play, and emerged from the rafters . Swat: Providence College Coach Ed Cooley reportedly tried to swat the marauding mammal with a clipboard on which he usually draws up plays for the team . 'They got it. They almost got it. Oh my God! It's crazy! He's making another swoop! He's making another swoop! Oh my God!' Providence College Coach Ed Cooley, meanwhile, swatted at the marauding bat with a clipboard, while his players, as well as those from competing Marquette University, futilely tossed towels at the obviously-distressed animal. 'They got it. They almost got it. Oh my God! It's crazy! He's making another swoop! He's making another swoop! Oh my God!' Spectators joined attempts to corral the critter, gleefully hurling jackets and articles of clothing at the bat from the stands, all of it missing and littering the suddenly-muddled court. Meanwhile, the arena's public address announcer utilized the bat's presence to riff on an aging rocker's one-time antics. As players and referees wildly dove for cover from the animal's repeated plunges, Marquette's public address announcer played 'Crazy Train' by Ozzy Osbourne, who infamously once tore the head off of a bat with his teeth during a concert, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. Look out: The moment a bat emerges from the rafters during a basketball game Saturday and swoops down at a panicked Providence College Friars player . Duck and cover: The Providence player dodges the nose-diving bat, stumbling backwards as if he had just drawn a charge . Easy does it: After stumbling backwards, the shocked Providence player loses his balance in the face of the swooping bat . Brace yourself: The Providence player finally tumbles backwards on to his bottom as the bat sews pandemonium among the other players on the court . After delaying the game numerous times to no avail, officials finally dimmed the arena's lights with 7:36 left to play in last-ditch effort to calm the bat. The Ozzy Osbourne ode reportedly gave way to a Whitney Houston song on the public address system, according to one media account, as fans waved cell phones in the dark, as if paying an homage at a concert. After that, the game finally resumed without incident, and Marquette went on to prevail 81-71. It appeared that the bat might play a decisive role in the outcome of the closely-contested meeting between the two schools. Quick-witted: The public address official utilized the bizarre moment to play Ozzy Osbourne's 'Crazy Train' in an apparent ode to the rocker's once biting off a bat's head . To corral a bat: As Osbourne's 'Crazy Train' roared on the arena's PA system, players threw towels at the swooping bat, and spectators hurled jackets on to the court . Marquette reportedly held a 58-42 advantage with 11:23 left in the second half when the bat initially started madly swooping around the arena. As play was delayed several times over the game's next four minutes of play, Providence managed to cut the lead to 61-55. Marquette University claimed the contest as a home game, as the school, as well as the NBA Milwaukee Bucks, compete in the BMO Harris Bradley Center, which is named after a local bank. The presence of the unusual arena denizen could be a product of the arena's advancing age, as it was reportedly - and officially - opened to the public on October 1, 1988. The so-called 'Bradley Center' is now one of the oldest arenas in use by an NBA team.","Saturday's game between Providence College and Marquette University was delayed numerous times .

"A series of upcoming spacewalks at the International Space Station have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits. Nasa is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear. The fault is linked to a 2013 emergency when water dangerously flooded a European astronaut’s helmet causing a near-drowning. A series of upcoming spacewalks at the International Space Station have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits. Nasa is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear . The first spacewalk by a pair of U.S. astronauts was supposed to occur tomorrow, but Nasa today bumped it to Saturday to complete a spacesuit investigation. The second spacewalk is now Wednesday; the third is March 1. The extensive, outdoor cable-routing work will prepare for the arrival of new commercial crew capsules in 2017. Two critical fan and pump units for the astronauts' spacesuits failed recently during routine maintenance in orbit. The spacewalks will be performed by Nasa astronauts Barry Wilmore (left) and Terry Virts (right) Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. Engineers suspect water seeped into the bearings, causing them to corrode and seize up. Both units were returned to Earth on the Dragon capsule last week. Spare units were put in the spacesuits, and those have checked out. Nasa says a pump failure would cut short a spacewalk, but not endanger anyone. An unrelated problem with the same component led to an astronaut's near-drowning in 2013. Kenny Todd, a space station manager, said earlier this week that the corrosion is likely the result of frequent water sampling put in place after the 2013 episode. Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts are the designated spacewalkers. The astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station. The ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017. The space agency would like to pull off all three spacewalks before Wilmore leaves the orbiting lab in mid-March. Private companies SpaceX and Boeing are working on crew capsules — under Nasa contract — to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the space station.

"An elementary school classroom aide who was suspended after the school discovered her partially-nude modeling shots has returned to work. Kaitlin Pearson, 23, was notified on Monday that she . could return to her job teaching special-needs students at South Street Elementary School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and went back on Tuesday. Fitchburg schools superintendent Andre Ravenelle said in a statement that Pearson was reinstated after the school reviewed 'all relevant information' following an investigation into her second job. Pearson has not responded to messages for comment, but her father told WBZ-TV that his daughter loves her job and is happy to be back. Racy: Kaitlin Pearson, 23, was suspended . from her teacher's aide job over images of her posing partially nude - but she has now gone back to work. She shared some of the images on her . Instagram page, pictured . Posing: Pearson has also shared the images on her public Facebook page. Here, she poses for selfies . She was suspended with pay last week after the racy photos were sent anonymously to the school and to the Sentinel & Enterprise . newspaper with a note saying, 'Can you believe that this girl was hired . to work with special education children in the Fitchburg schools?!!' The school said they were investigating whether the job affected her ability to work with children. Some images show her posing in bikinis or sportswear at sports events, and she has appeared in multiple amateur shoots, including for ModelsMania magazine. Other photographs that have since surfaced online show Pearson, who has a long term boyfriend, posing partially nude as she embraces other naked female models. Model: Pearson, pictured with her boyfriend, has been working full-time at the school since November . In the cover of a September 2013 issue of ModelsMania magazine, she appears with another topless woman. In an online profile for Model Mayhem she specifically says she does not pose fully nude. 'I . am energetic, creative, feisty, passionate about modeling, and I bring . my love of life to every shoot!' she writes. 'I'm balancing modeling . with a full time job, so my time is very precious. I am here to expand . my modeling horizons and am interested in serious opportunities.' The racy images can also be found on Pearson's open Facebook page. Parents had a mixed reaction to the photos. Online presence: The Massachusetts school says it does not carry out online searches for prospective employees before hiring them, but after the incident with Pearson, pictured, it may consider it . Probe: South Street Elementary School staff have now collected all 'relevant information' in their investigation . 'You're trying to be a role model for the kids,' said parent Andy Saocedo, while another added: 'She probably leaves work at work and her modeling career separate from her teaching career.' Her mother, Chuck Pearson, insisted that her daughter should not be fired for the photos. 'That's her private life,' she said. 'She's 23. She's a grown up woman.' The school system carried out criminal background checks on prospective employees, but does not carry out checks across social media. Ravenelle added that school officials have not 'Googled' people before hiring them, but may now start doing so in light of this incident.","Kaitlin Pearson was suspended with pay from a Fitchburg, Massachusetts school last week after staff were sent racy photographs anonymously .

"A disabled killer whale that is missing two fins is able to survive in the wild with the help of its family, who hunt food its food. The young killer whale has no dorsal fin or right-side pectoral fin, leaving it unable to hunt for itself. But rather than be left to fend for . itself or die, the whale appears to be cared for by members of its pod, . which share their food with the youngster. The disabled killer whale is allowed to share the spoils of the hunt by fellow pod members . The young whale is missing its dorsal fin and its right pectoral fin and cannot hunt . The killer whale was photographed off the coast of Port Elizabeth, South Africa by Rainer Schimpf . It is one of the few times that killer whales have been seen to feed and care for a non-hunting member. Underwater . photographer Rainer Schimpf came face to face with the pod while the members hunted in waters off Port Elizabeth in South Africa. He said: 'Incapable of fast hunting and ambushing prey it has to be dependent on the pod which, one assumes, looks after it very well. 'It shows these mammals are not really just ruthless killing machines but they also have complex, caring social-structures in which they and care for their own disabled members.' Mr Schimpf had been tracking the pod of seven as they hunted a Bryde's whale - measuring 50ft (15m) in length and weighing a massive 15 tonnes. The curious killer whale investigated the photographer's boat but did not join in the pod's hunt . The photographer said the care shown to the disabled whale shows the species are not 'ruthless' The whale's disability means it could not hunt at speed and ambush its prey and relies on other members . Killer whales are known to hunt and kill larger whale species - but sometimes only eat the tongue, research has shown. The pod also included a female with a bent dorsal fin like the killer whale in Free Willy, a 'huge male' and four other females. He said the younger whale followed at a distance and appeared to have fallen behind. The younger killer whale stayed at a distance when the rest of the pod hunted at the surface and then in the depths. 'It was brave and curious enough to come close to the boat and inspect us,' said Mr Schimpf, a guide for Dive Expert Tour. 'But after a while he disappeared as well, presumably to dive down to the whale-feast below. 'Such a kill would easily support the entire orca pod and make sharing of the kill much easier than if they had taken a seal or a dolphin.' Mr Schimpf was tracking a 50ft Bryde's whale when he came across the unusual pod . The young disabled male stayed at a distance when the pod went in for the kill after hunting the Bryde's whale . One of the pod had a bent dorsal fin, pictured, that was similar to the famous killer whale in Free Willy . The find is one of only a handful where injured or disabled killer whales have been known to survive with the help of its pod. In 1996 researchers spotted a killer-whale calf that was missing its tail and part of its dorsal fin - believed to have been sliced off by a boat propeller. The injured killer whale - known as stumpy - was not seen for many seasons afterwards and presumed dead until it popped up again seven years later. It was last seen feeding with a pod off the coast of Queensland, Australia, in 2008.","Rainer Schimpf spotted the whale off Port Elizabeth in South Africa .

Yelena . said: 'I think we were incredibly lucky to find Zhenya, that video got . so successful first because Major Lazer reposted it - that immediately . brought more people to us, and then the tune went on radio and TV and . became really popular among dance hall dancers.' Major Lazer is an electronic music project created by American DJ and record producer Diplo.Yelena . said: 'Then the media noticed us - so now every week it adds a million . more hits, I am not even always sure how it happens. The academy has gained global appeal after a video of the training regime of the some of the dancers was posted on the internet . Many of the school's classes are held in the evening as the dancer either work or study during the day . 'We filmed . it not only to promote our school, but to show how great it is here in . Siberia. It is fantastic to see that it worked, and naturally it helps . our dancing centre's popularity.' The video follows a women, who, despondent about the minus 42 C temperature, begins to dream of warmer climates. Her daydream follows a group of scantily clad Fraules dancers working some serious moves against a tropical looking sunset, before stripping down further to twerk on a sandy beach. Apart . from the sheer skill of the dance routine Fraules is a great Siberian . business success story in Novosibirsk, our biggest city, and the third . largest in Russia. Yelena . said: 'I am aged 23 and was born here, I have lived here all my life. Two years ago I got my diploma from the faculty of business at . Novosibirsk State Technical University. 'I . began dancing when I was ten years old. For about seven years I was . going to 'Todes' dancing studio, and then began adding various master . classes to improve my skills, including the foreign master classes. 'Then I began teaching myself and in 2010 I opened my own school.' The video, which has so far received over 30 million views on YouTube follows the daydream of a young girl . Twerk, which is a separate style when you shake your derriere, has gained popularity in recent years . The video which brought the academy worldwide fame sees the dancers move to the beach and strip down further . Besides the considerable talent of the dancers, it is not hard to see why the video has been viewed so many times . Owner of the school, Siberian born Yelena, 23, regularly organizes dance competitions and battles for her dancers . 'I am very grateful to my teacher Yulia Masayeva - she got me into hip-hop, house, dance hall, popping and locking styles. 'In . the end we chose dance hall, and later I got to vogue style. She got me . to go to Moscow for master classes, then I went for four trips to Paris . to visit various dancing classes. 'This is my life now - my school is my work, my business, the main thing I do. 'Our . main classes are in the evening since our students either study or . work, but there is a lot to do before that, and I constantly think about . my school with a view to improving it. I want it to be bigger than just . a dance class, though of course there are people that just want to . come, have a dance class and leave. 'But many other students want to learn dancing with a view to take part in competitions - and win. This is what we help them do. Young ladies carefully watch themselves as they perform a 'twerking' routine, for which Frayles has become known for . Due to the sexual nature of twerking, the school only takes girls aged 16 or over . 'It helped . me to get business education, I went there with a thought of opening my . own business one day. I am so happy it turned out that way. 'We . organise most of our city's dance battles and competitions. The most . recent and biggest of them was in May where we had eight choreographers, . including our star guest Danielle Polanco.' As well as being Beyonce's choreographer, Danielle was the leading lady in Omarion's music video Touch. She . also starred in the 2008 movie Step Up 2: The Streets, in which she . portrayed Missy Serrano, and appeared in the Broadway revival of West . Side Story as one of the Shark girls, Consuela. Yelena . said: 'The main goal for dancers is to take part in as many . competitions outside Novosibirsk and Russia - and win - as possible'. 'Of . course, it is not easy to travel as much as they wish as tickets can be . expensive, and naturally it takes a lot of dedication to keep on . training, sometimes months and months of endless rehearsals. Many of the dancers who train at Fraules want to take part in as many competitions outside Novosibirsk and Russia as possible . 'My students went to Moscow with me, soon we were going to the dancing camp. I've been to Europe and twice won competitions in Sweden and Germany. 'There is always a surprised reaction when people abroad hear that you came from Siberia. 'It is so cold there, how on earth can you do training? 'The right name for it is twerk, which is a separate style when you shake your derriere. Booty dance is more like its marketing, commercial name. ' 'Girls and women of different ages come to study it - well, except that I try to limit the youngest and stop them from doing it. 'I think it is not correct from the moral point of view to teach 13, 14, 15-year-old girls, because the movements carry a quite clear connotation. 'They beg me to take them, and even their parents call me and plead to teach their children, saying that they give their permission. 'It is certainly an energetic and beautiful dance routine, by my position is that you should start it from an older age - at least from 16'. 'Perhaps you can compare us to America with their Broadway Dance Centre where a person can come and 'dive' into one particular dance style. 'They've inspired me to create something similar so that people from different cities can come and spend three months studying and working on one dance style. We are moving towards it gradually.'","Fraules Dancing Centre called 'Siberia's greatest export'

"A two-timing cheat with a very short temper decided to go on Dr. Phil to decide if he should leave his wife for his mistress, and let the two ladies meet for the first time. Melvin is married to Rachel, but while the two were separated he began dating Chantelle. That was two years ago, and now Melvin spends his time flip flopping between the two women, who have somehow fallen under his spell. Scroll down for video . Two-timer: Melvin (above) is having a relationship with his wife and a mistress . Over it: Melvin's wife Rachel (above) just wants him to make a decision so she can move on with her life .

These days, Melvin is living with Chantelle, and his wife Rachel just wants to know what he wants to do with his life so she can finally move on with hers. Rachel also has little tolerance for the woman who stayed with her husband as they tried to work on their relationship. 'It’s disgusting to me,' she tells Chantelle. 'I don’t see how someone could do that. If she knows we were trying to work things out, she should be a woman and back away.' It is also revealed that Rachel alleges that she got two STDs from her husband.

At one point he even storms off stage, with Chantelle quickly running after him. Called out: Dr. Phil cannot understand why either woman is with Melvin . When asked why everyone keeps laughing at him, Dr. Phil is kind enough to explain, saying; 'They’re laughing because it’s ridiculous. They’re laughing because of your absolute and utter lack of insight and narcissistic, self-serving sh*t is more than they can take.' He then adds, 'And that should be a huge wake-up call to you.' Chantelle meanwhile claims she just wants Melvin to be loved, and says that Rachel treats him horribly whenever they get back together. Dr. Phil informs her she does not get an opinion on the matter as she is an 'interlooper' in the relationship. In the end however, Dr. Phil explains to Chantelle, 'If he cheats on his wife he's going to cheat on you.' As for Melvin, it seems like Rachel may have finally had enough, and he and the mistress certainly seem to deserve one another.

"Ancient marine algae fossils may provide clues about how today’s microscopic oceanic organisms will respond to  climate change. Warming waters affected the growth and skeletal structure of  ancient algae, and scientists hope the findings will deepen their understanding of how life will adapt as Earth's temperature rises. Coccolithophores, a type of marine algae, are prolific in the ocean today and have been for millions of years. Researchers found that warming waters affected the growth and skeletal structure of ancient algae. This image shows a scanning electron micrograph of fossil coccolithophore species, Coccolithus pelagicus. The fossil is from New Jersey and is around 56 million years old . The single-celled plankton produce calcite skeletons that are preserved in abundance in seafloor sediments after they die. Although they are microscopic, their numbers makes them key contributors to marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle. For instance, a build up of skeletons contribute to massive structures such as the White Cliffs of Dover. A study by the University of Southampton has revealed that the growth of coccolithophores is stunted as oceans become more acidic, because of an increase in atmospheric carbon monoxide. Researchers did not look at the number of algae that may have been affected, so cannot deduce whether changes in their size due to climate change, did, or may, have had an impact on the oceanic food chain. The study, published in Nature Communications, looked at preserved fossil remains of coccolithophores from a period of climate warming and ocean acidification that occurred around 56 million years ago. This time is known as the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). It offers a  long-term view of coccolithophore response to ocean acidification. Scientists already know that warming waters and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels lead to the acidification of the oceans, which kills off coral (pictured). This study gives experts another organism to study and look for warning signs of damage . Dr Sarah O’Dea, from Ocean and Earth Science said: ‘Our results show that climate change significantly altered coccolithophore calcification rates at the PETM and has the potential to be just as significant, perhaps even more so, today. ‘Ultimately then, it is the factors that influence where species live, their abundance, how fast they grow and their ability to adapt to environmental change that is likely to control future coccolithophore calcite production.’ The study investigated two key ancient coccolithophores - Coccolithus pelagicus and Toweius pertusus - both of which are directly related to species that dominate the modern ocean. It found that calcification rates of C. pelagicus and T. pertusus halved during the PETM because the environment influenced their growth. The response of each species was different, and involved intervals of slowed growth in C. pelagicus and an overall reduction in the size of the skeletal components in T. pertusus. However, there was  little evidence for any response to ocean acidification, other than perhaps a slight thinning of C. pelagicus coccoliths. Dr O'Dea told MailOnline that smaller and thinner skeletons may mean that algae may be easier prey, but no evidence of this has been found. A larger question, which the study does not answer, may be that if the creatures have smaller skeletons, animals up the food chain may get less calcium by eating them, which is needed to contract muscle, transmit messages through nerves and releasing hormones - as well as strengthening bones. Fish are losing their survival instinct as the world's oceans become more acidic because of climate change, a study released earlier this year claimed. The research confirmed laboratory experiments showing that the behaviour of reef fish can be seriously affected by increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the ocean. Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is absorbed into ocean waters, where it dissolves and lowers the pH of the water. Fish are losing their survival instinct as the world's oceans become more acidic because of climate change, a study released earlier this year claimed. A stock image is pictured . The study was the first to analyse the sensory impairment of fish from carbon dioxide seeps, where pH is similar to what climate models forecast for surface waters by the turn of the century. The pH of normal ocean surface water is around 8.14. The study examined fish from so-called bubble reefs at a natural CO2 seep in Papua New Guinea, where the pH is 7.8 on average. With today's greenhouse gas emissions, climate models forecast pH 7.8 for ocean surface waters by 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Experts from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta showed that fish's sensory systems are impaired by ocean acididication in the laboratory. 'They can smell but they can't distinguish between chemical cues,' biologist Danielle Dixson said. Acidic waters affect fish behavior by disrupting a specific receptor in the nervous system, called GABAA, which is present in most marine organisms with a nervous system. When GABAA stops working, neurons stop firing properly. Coral reef habitat studies have found that CO2-induced behavioral changes, similar to those observed in the new study, increase mortality from predation by more than fivefold in newly settled fish. Fish can smell a fish that eats another fish and will avoid water containing the scent. In Dr Dixson's laboratory experiments, control fish given the choice between swimming in normal water or water spiked with the smell of a predator chose the normal water. But fish raised in water acidified with carbon dioxide chose to spend time in the predator-scented water.","Scientists from the University of Southampton have studied coccolithophores - a type of ancient algae - that are still prolific today .

"Warren Jeffs (pictured in court in 2010) has been sending letters from his cell to Utah legislators . The leader of a polygamous  sect who was jailed for the sexual assault of two girls he considered 'brides' has been sending numerous letters to Utah legislators, it has been reported. Lawmakers have said they do not know why there has been an increase in letters from Warren Jeffs calling for repentance in recent months. Senate President Wayne Niederhauser said most of the legislators however have not taken the letters, which are sometimes bound in hardcover, seriously and have thrown them out without reading them or given them away. 'There's a lot of ""thus sayeth the lord,""' Niederhauser said. The letters continue along the lines of 'let us worship how we want to worship, and if you don't, there's imminent warnings of chaos,' he said. Senator Todd Weiler said he gives the mailings to Capitol visitors as souvenirs and once gave the book to a GOP silent auction, where it sold for about $30. The letters used to arrive in FedEx shipments with postmarks from Hilldale, Utah, but now arrive through the U.S. Postal Service, according to The Associated Press. One of the letters, dated June 14, is signed from Palestine, Texas, where Jeffs is in prison. He is serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting girls he considered brides. Members of his church, a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. Legislative staff members have kept one of the hardcover letters, a black tome embossed in gold with the title 'Jesus Christ; Message to all Nations', in the House of Representatives' office. The volume, which is an inch and a half thick, warns U.S. and international leaders to 'cause your habitations to be prepared for the great day of the Lord.' Legislative staff members have kept one of the hardcover letters, a black tome embossed in gold with the title 'Jesus Christ; Message to all Nations' The volume sent to legislators proclaims Jeffs' innocence and demands the sect be left alone . It continues, 'Officials shall fear for their lives.' The letter proclaims Jeffs' innocence, and demands the sect be left alone and pending court cases against it be dropped. Jason Clark, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said Jeffs receives few visitors and rarely sends out letters, although he can receive anywhere between 25 to 800 pieces of mail a day. The incoming and outgoing mail is inspected by corrections officials for threats and contraband. The volume, which is an inch and a half thick, warns U.S. and international leaders to 'cause your habitations to be prepared for the great day of the Lord' Jeffs, along with the other inmates, is allowed to make monitored and recorded phone calls, which are allowed to last for no more than 20 minutes. Clark said Jeffs however does not often use the phone. In 2012, when Jeffs was held in county jails, sheriffs overseeing the facilities told CNN that he spent thousands every month on phone cards. Polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the mainstream church and its 15 million members worldwide abandoned the practice in 1890 and strictly prohibit it today.","Warren Jeffs has been sending letters to legislators calling for repentance .

"Turkish Airline, which recently came under fire for banning lipstick, fired a stewardess after bosses found racy pictures she did for an Italian magazine.

Zuhal Sengal, 31, was sacked after airline chiefs found these racy pictures in an Italian magazine . She was fired as modelling is not one of the 'certain standards and qualities' expected from employees . In the pictures, Ms Sengal poses provocatively dressed in a corset and bustier. And a video of the shoot shows her walking around a swimming pool in a skimpy bikini revealing tattoos on her body. A spokesman for the company said: 'There are certain standards and qualities we expect from our staff and modelling is not one of them.' The airline has previously told employees investigations will be conducted into those who post inappropriate material on social media. And last year, it was criticised after trying to prevent female crew members for wearing certain colours of lipstick. Staff were told pink, red or claret lipstick as well as tattoos, high buns and wigs were forbidden. A statement from the airline said: 'Simple make-up, immaculate and in pastel colours, is preferred for staff working in the service sector.' But the move by Turkish Airlines is seen as a sign the country is becoming more conservative and religious . Zuhal Sengal, from Istanbul, pictured left in a selfie and right, in a picture from a photo shoot . But bosses were forced to withdraw the ban after staff guidelines were leaked to the media causing a storm of protest with the airline being accused of becoming 'too Islamic.' Airline bosses have admitted Turkey is becoming more Islamic as the airline is attempting to shape the company to fit its ideology. President of the airline's Hava-Is labour union, Atilay Aycin, said: 'This new guideline is totally down to Turkish Airlines management's desire to shape the company to fit its own political and ideological stance. 'No one can deny that Turkey has become a more conservative, religious country.' Temel Kotil, the airline's chief executive said: 'As to the lipstick, we had no problems but somehow low-level managers put together a paper without asking us and that paper was leaked to the media and became a big issue.'

"Lewis Carroll's original handwritten, illustrated manuscript for 'Alice in Wonderland' will travel to the U.S. to mark its 150th anniversary. The British Library said Thursday it will loan the book — presented by the author to Alice Liddell, who inspired it — to New York's Morgan Library and Museum and the Rosenbach Museum of the Free Library of Philadelphia next year. The work, which bears its original title of 'Alice's Adventures Under Ground,' was bought by an American dealer in 1928 and returned to Britain in 1948. Original manuscript: This is a rendering of Alice, as she grows larger in the original manuscript of Alice in Wonderland written and illustrated by Lewis Carroll . Tea time: This is an original illustration by Lewis Carroll in the Alice in Wonderland manuscript going on display in American museums . 'The enchanting tale of Wonderland was first told “one golden afternoon” to Alice Liddell and her two sisters.

"A suicidal mother has been charged with murder for killing both her children before a failed suicide attempt Saturday morning. Marilyn Edge, 42, of Scottsdale, AZ., tried taking her own life in a car accident in Costa Mesa, CA before telling responding cops they would be able to find her 13-year-old autistic son Jaelen Edge and 10-year-old daughter Faith in a nearby hotel room. The young childrens' bodies were discovered just after 8:30am at a Hampton Inn in Santa Ana. The cause of death for both children has not yet been made public, nor have their causes of death. Their identities have been revealed by MailOnline. Ms Edge previously sued the federal government alleging her son developed autism after a vaccination. Disturbed: Marilyn Edge, 42, tried to kill herself at least twice before telling cops where to find her dead children, officials said . Crime scene investigators photograph a car believed to be driven by a women who allegedly tried to commit suicide by ramming it into a utility box behind a Costa Mesa shopping center. Her children were found dead in the Hampton Inn Suites in Santa Ana . Initially taken to the hospital to tend to her injuries after the accident - in which she slammed her car into parking poles surrounding a utility box located behind a shopping plaza - Ms Edge is now in police custody after being charged with two counts of murder. 'It was clear that it was an intentional act,' Costa Mesa spokesperson Tim Starn said. The disturbed woman refused to get out of the gray Honda Accord and attempted to strangle herself to death with an electrical . cord while emergency responders frantically broke a window to enter the car and save her, according to KABC. Ms Edge had an even more grisly secret to share once investigators broke her windows and discovered propane tanks inside, perhaps an attempt to blow the car up in an accident - her children were dead. Scene of the crime: The two children were found dead in a room at this Hampton Inn in Santa Ana, CA . Awful: The woman told cops where her children were after multiple failed suicide attempts, according to Santa Ana Police spokesperson Anthony Bertagna . She allegedly told paramedics where to find both Jaelen and Faith while en-route to a local hospital, officials said. 'We linked the two crime scenes based on statements made by the woman at the scene of the crash,' Mr Bertagna said while briefing local media. The children do not appear to have been shot or stabbed, said Mr Bertagna. No weapons were recovered at either scene, he added. The parking poles kept any harm from being inflicted on the utility box during Ms Edge's failed suicide, Mr Bertagna noted. Shocking: One hotel guest called the killings 'horrendous' and 'a heartbreaker' It is not clear what brought the doomed trio to the California town, about 40 miles south of Los Angeles, but a review of court records by MailOnline is starting to piece together part of what may have driven Ms Edge to Saturday's tragic events. The doting mother sued the Secretary of Health and Human Services in 2004, alleging a vaccination gave her son autism, court records showed. The case was dismissed only last year. Citing a lack of medical records supporting Ms Edge's claim, and the lack of a valid medical opinion to further bloster it, Chief Special Master Patricia Campbell-Smith dismissed the suit for 'insufficient proof.' Ms Edge was awarded a judgement in the amount of $7,692 to settle legal fees owed for the suit. It is not clear if or when she ever received that money. The double homicide left locals and hotel guests stunned. 'My goodness if there's two children involved that's just horrendous to say the least,' Mike Ramey told KABC 'As a parent, it's just a heartbreaker.' A motive for the childrens' deaths has not yet been established, and authorities are now searching for their father, KABC reported. Their causes of death have also still not been made public and are pending the coroner's report. Ms Edge is sitting in a jail cell while investigators try to piece together the series of events that led to the death of her two innocent children.","Jaelen Edge, 13, and Faith,10, were found dead just before 8am Saturday morning - Jaelen is believed to be autistic .

"A woman dubbed the UK's most evil mother - who was charged but not convicted over her son's murder - has again pleaded her innocence and called for fresh information on the 20th anniversary of the killing. Rikki Neave, six, was strangled and left for dead, naked, in woodland near Peterborough's Welland Estate - just 500 yards from his family home - on November 29, 1994. His mother, Ruth Neave, was charged with his murder but a jury found her not guilty at Northampton Crown Court. Ruth Neave and her husband Gary Rogers today launched a fresh appeal for information about the murder of Mrs Neave's son, Rikki Neave, who was found dead near his family home, on November 29, 1994 . Rikki, six, was strangled and left for dead, naked, in woodland near Peterborough's Welland Estate . However, she admitted charges of causing child cruelty to Rikki and his two sisters, Rebecca, then eight, and Rochelle, three, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. The case caused a national outcry after details of the horrific abuse Rikki suffered at his mother's hand became public. Mrs Neave, who moved from Peterborough after being freed in 2000, today held a press conference at the Oliver Cromwell Hotel in March, Cambridgeshire, were she appealed for information to catch her son's killer. The 45-year-old acknowledged that the perception that she had killed her son still lingered, but claimed the real killers were a sex abuse gang. She called for those living on Welland Easte to come forward: 'We know you know something about where Rikki was that night and who killed him and why he was killed. She claimed the estate was riddled by criminals in 1994, the year Rikki was killed. Mrs Neave said: 'Many had a lot to hide and lied in their statements and even got immunity. 'But we'll fight this to the end on our own if need be - other people have their agenda, I say get on with it,' She added: 'It could have been your mother, father, uncle, aunt, son, daughter, cousin or even an old/new neighbour who acted weird that night or probably never came home that night until after 7 am the following day. 'These people are not going to come forward lightly, I am not silly, but a prick of conscience may play a part somewhere. 'If anyone saw one, two, three or even four people early that Tuesday morning between 4-8am in the area of Belvoir Way Woods or Eye Road we would be so grateful.' A wild-eyed Mrs Neave after being arrested and taken into custody following her son's murder in 1994 . A year after her arrest Mrs Neave struggles with police as they try and put her back into a prison van . She asked anyone with information to call police, Crimestoppers, or to contact her though the email address justiceforrikki.info@mail.com. Mrs Neave claimed police had wrongly charged her because she was an 'easy target' and said she had been pressured into pleading guilty to the neglect charges. Speaking before the press conference she told how the last 20 years of her life had been a 'nightmate' and said when Rikki died 'I died inside too'. Mrs Neave claimed she had been intimidated, bullied and threatened, but despite now being crippled by arthritis, was as determined as ever to 'do what I have to do to get to the truth and no-one is going to stop me' But as she restated her innocence at the press conference, her daughter, Rochelle Neave, now 23, recalled the horror of growing up in the family home: 'Although I was only young I can still remember the abuse. 'I can remember her dragging my sister up the stairs by her hair and there was never any food in the house. She spent all her money on drugs. 'I don't know why she's dragging this up 20 years later. She should let it lie. 'She may have been cleared of murder but she was convicted of cruelty and I don't think the police will find anybody else responsible for his death.' And protesters gathered outside the hotel objecting to Mrs Neave continuing to plead her innocence and appeal for information. Steven Fox, 45, was among the protesters outside the hotel, who objected to Mrs Neave's public appeal. He said: 'As a single dad bringing up two boys who suffered abuse from their mother, I don't think it's appropriate that she's doing this here. 'The local community still feels very strongly about what she did and feelings still run deep.' Rikki had been on social services 'at risk' register and there had been a history of abuse by Mrs Neave. Mrs Neave displays  holds up two pictures of people she believes were responsible for the death of her son . Mrs Neave said her other children, who were all taken into care and later adopted, had been 'brainwashed' against her and had frozen her out of their lives. She is no longer in contact with them. She said: 'If they want to talk to me, they know where I am. 'I will prove that I should never have been accused of cruelty.' Mrs Neave said she had evidence that Rikki was in fact killed by a sex abuse gang which she had passed on to Cambridgeshire Police. She said: 'I know people out there think I'm a murderer but I'm determined to prove that somebody else did this to my boy.' She hopes Cambridgeshire Police will act on her concerns within the next four months. Detective Superintendent Paul Fullwood, from Cambridgeshire Police, said any action taken by the family is 'a matter for them'. But he said police had met with Mrs Neave and her husband Gary Rogers, 52, last month and agreed to re-examine a 'numbers of matters they raised'. There was 'insufficient evidence' to start a fresh investigation, Det Sup Fullwood said, but the case would remain open until ' those responsible for the tragic death of Rikki can be brought to justice'. Mrs Neave and Mr Rogers married in 2010 and launched their quest for a fresh investigation into Rikki's murder from their flat in Cambridge. She said: 'I feel let down by everyone - police, social services and people who just chucked me under a bus for what reason to save their own skin.' 'All the lies in the statements and to the media were all about money. 'I have been telling the truth for 20 years and no-one has listened or took anything on board in what I have been saying until I met my new husband Gary.' Of her late son, Mrs Neave said: 'My Rikki was the most beautiful person I have ever known, he was sweet, cheeky, and full of life and mischief and he had not a bad bone in his body. 'I love him so much it hurts. 'Rikki was so very bright. 'He idolised his sisters and yes there were tantrums, arguing, fall outs and shouting that went on, but he loved them totally. 'What really broke my heart that was the fact I never was allowed to have anything of Rikki and what was Rikki's was destroyed and trashed by neighbours. 'Photos of Rikki were sold to the press for drugs.' Mrs Neave recalled the last time she saw her son, on the morning of November 28, 1994, when she got him up for school. She was 'knackered' but not asleep, and claims she heard him get dress and leave. But that afternoon he never came home. After alerting police a search was launched and he was found dead nearby. She said: 'Rikki was a challenge, but it would not be Rikki if he was good all the time. 'He knew right from wrong early in his life,' said Mrs Neave. 'He was a cheeky monkey, full of mischief and such a cute face he would look at me and put on his baby eyes - they made me melt every time. 'He was the cutest boy ever.'","Rikki Neave was found dead in woodlands near his family home in 1994 .

"Australian scientists have fired harpoons into whale sharks, which can measure 30 foot in length, in a bid to decipher the creature's annual journeys using Google Maps. Despite being one of nature's giants and weighing in at 30 tons, the movements of whale sharks remain a mystery to scientists, who want to protect the species' falling numbers. Researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science have satellite tagged a number of whale sharks to monitor their long-distance migrations from north-west Australia to Asia, which can see them traveling hundreds of miles in a few weeks.

Pictures show marine scientists tagging the huge fish with harpoons to track their 8,000 mile journeys through the sea at depths of up to 3,000-feet. Underwater photographer Peter Verhoog, from Holland teamed up with Dr Mark Meekan of the Institute to cover the underwater research project in Ningaloo Reef, 800 miles off the coast of Western Australia. Mr Verhoog said: ''The whale sharks were tagged with a harpoon, that holds the pointed end of the tag and goes into the 10 cm thick skin.

Scientists will follow the shark's progress using the satellite tag and Google Maps. He said: 'Satellite tagging of Whale Sharks has demonstrated that these animals undertake multi-annual and very long-distance migrations. 'These journeys include over 12,00 miles from north-west Australia towards Asia, or 300 miles within a few weeks.' Whale sharks may be huge but they are the gentle giants of the ocean. They feed off plankton and other tiny sea-creatures rather than hunting like other predatory fish. Sadly these magnificent creatures are a vulnerable species and their numbers are thought to be falling. Satellite tagging of whale sharks has demonstrated that these animals undertake multi-annual and very long-distance migrations . Scientists want to study shark behaviour and their sometimes worldwide migration and feeding patterns . However, marine experts like Mr Verhoog and Dr Meekan are battling to learn more about the planet's largest fish before they are in danger of being lost forever.

"On any other stretch of water it probably wouldn’t garner a second glance. But this is monster territory. Footage of a shadowy figure briefly emerging from the depths of Loch Ness has once again fuelled speculation that its legendary resident is alive and well. Grainy footage has emerged showing a long and thin shape swaying in the water that bears a striking resemblance to Nessie’s fabled slender neck. Scroll down for video . Richard Collis appears to have captured footage of Nessie's head and neck emerging from Loch Ness . The video shows the object waving in the choppy water, around 500ft from the loch’s shore. It was captured by Richard Collis – who counts himself amongst the most ardent Nessie cynics after years of fishing on the waters without a sighting. But the tree planter was so taken aback by the mysterious shape he noticed while driving along the edge of the loch that he filmed it on his iPhone, and believes he might have stumbled upon the real deal. ‘As I was watching, I was thinking what the hell is that?’ said Mr Collis, 58, who noticed the shape while travelling around a mile from Fort Augustus at the south-west end of Loch Ness. He added: ‘I don’t really believe in anything like that until I see it. ‘I’m not saying it was a fire breathing dragon and I never saw teeth or anything like that, but I must have thought there was something there if I stopped to take pictures.’ The footage appears to show a long thin neck and head emerging from 500ft away from the shore of Loch Ness . Mr Collis said he thought the figure in the water was about 500ft away from the shore in the choppy waters . The footage, lasting two minutes in total, was taken last Thursday. Mr Collis’s wife Vibeke, 60, added: ‘I’ve been here 37 years and my husband has been here his whole life, so we are completely aware of how unique this is. I couldn’t believe it and laughed when he showed me because I knew he could never set that up. He’s not very technical.’ The image will now join hundreds of other possible sightings that have amassed over the years, some of which have been confirmed to be fakes. Only last week, paranormal investigator Jonathan Bright published an image taken three years ago appearing to show the head of a monster in the loch. But despite decades of speculation, the mysterious creature has so far proved little more than a myth. The video footage appears to be the latest sighting of the monster, since it was first spotted 1,500 years ago . International paranormal investigator, Jonathon Bright took this photo, which he believes proves Nessie exists . Comparison: Monster photographer Jonathan Bright drew a rough sketch to show how he sees the mysterious object in the water . In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast. A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathon's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.

"Tiny creatures hidden inside oil on Earth could help researchers find alien life in deep space, researchers claim. German scientists believe that have discovered microbes living within droplets of water found within a lake in Trinidad and Tobago. Their discovery suggests that life could exist within similar ponds in distant moons such as Saturn's satellite Titan. Scientists believe that have discovered microbes living within droplets of water found within Lake Pitch . The find was made on Pitch Lake, located at La Brea in the southwest of the country, which is the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. The lake is a source of oil - it rises to the surface, where it solidifies and forms a hard crust. Scientists had previously believed oil was too toxic to support life, they thought it could only thrive at the boundary where oil and water meet. The study renews hopes of finding alien life on Titan. Last year, measurements of a big sea on Titan (pictured here in front of Saturn) revealed it contained about 5,590 cubic miles (9,000 cubic km) of mostly liquid methane. This equivalent, say scientists, to about 40 times the proven reserves of oil and gas on Earth . The study suggests found that a range of microbes could survive within water droplets in the oil itself . Life on Earth may have come from deep underground, rather than from the surface, according to a study of our planet’s deep subterranean. Last year, researchers found microbes living and reproducing as deep as 5km (3.1 miles) below ground providing clues to where life on Earth originated some 3.5 billion years ago. The study suggests these microbes may have survived in isolation from the Earth’s surface for billions of years. But this latest study suggests microbes could survive within water droplets in the oil itself. ‘Inside them we found complex microbial communities, which play an active part in oil degradation,” said Professor Rainer Meckenstock from the Helmholtz Zentrum München (HMGU). These water droplets contain a huge range of microbial species which breaks down the oil into different organic substances. The discovery renews hope of finding alien life in Titan, which has hydrocarbon lakes on its surface, Dirk Schulze-Makuch, an astrobiologist at Washington State University in Pullman, told Live Science. Last year, measurements of a big sea on Titan revealed it contained about 5,590 cubic miles (9,000 cubic km) of mostly liquid methane. This is equivalent to about 40 times the proven reserves of oil and gas on Earth. The latest discovery was made on Pitch Lake, located at La Brea in the southwest of Trinidad and Tobago . Pitch Lake is a natural source of oil; the oil rises to the surface, where it solidifies and forms a hard crust .","Scientists have found microbes living within drops of water found in oil .

"Incendiary: Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was paid £128,000 to talk at a Jewish fundraiser . Nicolas Sarkozy was paid more than £128,000 to criticise Israel to a room full of enraged Jewish business people, it emerged today. Delivering a master class in how not to perform a paid-for conference speech, the former French president caused offence at the prestigious world economic forum at Davos, Switzerland. Despite being hired to make his speech at a United Israel Appeal, Mr Sarkozy made it clear that he saw a proper Palestinian homeland as the only secure future for the Middle East. He attacked Israel for ‘surrounding herself with the walls of Jericho’, saying ‘it will be necessary to bring these walls down to prevent disaster.’ Mr Sarkozy’s words last Friday called for international pressure to be brought on Israel, so that it complied with Palestinian demands. This outraged many in the room, who included influential business people with close links to the state of Israel. His words were highlighted in the Times of Israel, which wrote: ‘The speech was reportedly poorly received by those present, who felt Sarkozy was venting his disappointment with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ‘Many of the participants complained to the organisers and even threatened to withdraw their donations and convince others to do the same.’ The notoriously controversial Mr Sarkozy then left the room in the President Wilson Hotel in Davos, as many of the audience threatened to withdraw their donations. Flashpoint: The former French president suggested a Palestinian homeland was the only secure future for the Middle East . Mr Sarkozy’s maternal grandfather was a . Greek Jew. Sarkozy is a Catholic, but maintained strong links with . Israel when he was French president up until last May. He is currently at the centre of a number of corruption enquires, including one in which he is accused of accepting illegal cash payments from France’s richest woman. The allegation is that Liliane Bettencourt, the l’Oreal heiress helped to fund Mr Sarkozy’s 2007 presidential election campaign. Anniversaire: Sarkozy celebrates his 57th birthday on a night out with his glamorous wife Carla Bruni in Paris yesterday . As Mr Sarkozy’s lawyers deal with such scandals, he is trying to establish himself as an international conference speaker in the style of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Mr Sarkozy’s efforts  at becoming a highly-paid raconteur have been hampered by the fact that he does not speak very good English, and his latest gaffe will also set his ambitions back. He was unavailable for comment today.","Former French president talking at a fundraiser by the United Israel Appeal .

"The family of the Christian mother-of-two on death row in Sudan have angrily accused the country's government of 'saying one thing and doing something else' as hopes for her release fade. Relatives of Meriam Ibrahim told MailOnline that they were 'frustrated and worried' that she had not been let go - despite the Sudanese foreign ministry undersecretary Abdallah Alazrag promising her freedom. Gabriel Wani, Meriam's brother-in-law, said they were already so disillusioned that they would only believe the promises when she was actually released. Meriam, 27, a doctor, has been in jail in the Sudanese capital Khartoum since September and was sentenced to death for apostasy and adultery by the country’s strict Islamic courts. Scroll down for video . Barbaric: Meriam’s case has attracted international . outrage, not least because she will be given 100 lashes within two . weeks unless her appeal is a success . Ibrahim has a son, 18-month-old Martin, who is living with her in jail, where she gave birth to a second child last week. By law, children must follow their father's religion . A judge ruled that she had broken the law because her father was a Muslim she should worship Islam - and that she could not marry Daniel, a biochemist who is a naturalized US citizen, because they are both Christians. Meriam’s case has attracted international outrage, not least because she will be given 100 lashes within two weeks unless her appeal is a success. She also gave birth to her daughter Maya while in shackles in jail. Her son 20-month-old Martin has been held with her at all times in her cell. In an interview with MailOnline Gabriel, a mental health counsellor who lives near his brother in Manchester, New Hampshire, said: ‘We will only believe that she is free when she is let out and arrives here in the US. ‘I said from the start that with the Sudanese government we can expect anything and that’s what has happened. ‘They are saying one thing and doing something else. We are frustrated and worried. It’s not surprising but we just want her freed’. Gabriel Wani, Meriam's brother-in-law, says he refuses to believe the Sudanese government's claims until he actually sees the mother-of-two set free . At the end of last week the international pressure to release Meriam appeared to have having an effect. The governments of the US and the UK had condemned her ‘barbaric’ treatment, British Prime Minister David Cameron had called for her to be freed, as had Hillary Clinton and actress and human rights campaigner Mia Farrow. An Amnesty petition attracted more than 900,000 signatures and the Twitter hashtag ‘#savemeriam’ began trending. Hopes were raised when Alazrag said in an interview over the weekend that Meriam would be ‘freed within days’ and ‘will definitely not be executed’. However the Sudan Tribune has now reported that Sudan’s foreign ministry spokesperson Abu Bakr al-Sideeg did not know of any plans to release Meriam ‘before a ruling from an appeals court’. Campaigners had said that they feared the Sudanese government was just ‘playing games’ to try and get the international community off its back. Meriam was condemned to death under Islamic law because she is Christian and married a Christian man . In many countries the headlines in the newspapers on Sunday was that Meriam was ‘to be freed’ but the reality now appears to be different. MailOnline can also reveal that Meriam has come under 'intense pressure' in recent days to renounce her Christian faith. A spokeswoman for the US-based campaign group Sudan Justice Centre, which has been paying for her legal fees, said that she was determined not to give in. She said: 'They have been promising Meriam money and security if she becomes a Muslim. 'They have said they will protect her and her family if she does what they want. 'She has had clerics in her cell practically the whole day telling her to give up her Christian faith. 'She feels like she is under a lot of pressure but she won't do what they want.'","Meriam's brother-in-law said government has been 'saying one thing and doing something else'

"A probe hurtling towards Pluto has captured the dwarf planet locked in a mesmerising dance with its largest moon, Charon. The New Horizons spacecraft took the footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet in 2015. The 12 images that make up the animation were taken from a distance ranging from 267 million to 262 million miles (429 million to 422 million km). Scroll down for animation . A probe hurtling towards Pluto has captured the dwarf planet locked in a dance with its largest moon . Put together, the footage covers Pluto and almost one full rotation of its largest moon, Charon, which orbits 11,200 miles (about 18,000km) above the dwarf planet's surface. Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The mission team are now using the footage - which focuses on Pluto's position against a backdrop of stars – to fine-tune the distance that New Horizons will fly past Pluto and its moons. Pluto's four smaller satellites are too faint to be seen in these distant images, but will begin to appear in images taken next year as the spacecraft speeds closer to its target. The mission team are now using the footage - which focuses on Pluto's position against a backdrop of stars – to fine-tune the distance that New Horizons will fly past Pluto and its moons . There remain many unanswered questions about Pluto. The New Horizons probe (artist's impression pictured) hopes to provide some answers when it flies by the dwarf planet on July 15, 2015 . The artist's concept shows the Pluto system from the surface of one of the smaller moons. Pluto is the large dwarf planet at centre, right. Charon, the system's largest moon, is the smaller body to the right of Pluto . 'The image sequence showing Charon revolving around Pluto set a record for close range imaging of Pluto - they were taken from 10 times closer to the planet than the Earth is,' says New Horizons mission Principal Investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute. Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The  moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The distance between them is 12,200 miles (19,640 km). Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 6.4 Earth days, and one Pluto day takes 6.4 Earth days. Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of Charon always faces Pluto -- this is called tidal locking. Compared with most of the planets and moons, the Pluto-Charon system is tipped on its side. 'But we'll smash that record again and again, starting in January, as approach operations begin. 'We are really excited to see our target and its biggest satellite in motion from our own perch,' he adds, 'less than a year from the historic encounter ahead.' New Horizons is near the end of its final pre-Pluto annual systems checkout and instrument calibration before Pluto arrival. The New Horizons mission operations team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, will put the spacecraft back into hibernation on August 29 - just four days after New Horizons crosses the orbit of Neptune on August 25. That final 'rest' lasts only until December 6, when New Horizons will stay wake for two years of Pluto encounter preparations, flyby operations, and data downlinks. There remain many unanswered questions about Pluto. The New Horizons probe hopes to provide some answers when it flies by the dwarf planet on July 15, 2015.

"A 72-year-old veteran beat off a 275-pound pickpocket with his cane last month after being targeted in suburban Detroit. Security camera footage shows the moment Chet Dunham walks past 23-year-old Jeffrey Darnell Jones II after finishing breakfast on March 27. Seconds later Jones reaches over into Dunham's back pocket, seemingly trying to steal the senior citizen's wallet. Scroll down for video . Don't mess with Chet: 72-year-old Chet Dunham (left) scared off suspected pickpocket Jeffrey Darnell Jones II (right) with his walking cane last month . 'I just hit him, that was it': Dunham speaks about defending himself against the 275-pound pickpocket in an interview with WDIV . But Mr Dunham quickly reacts, swinging around to hit Jones with his walking cane. 'I just hit him, that was it,' Mr Dunham told WDIV. 'There's nobody gonna have their hand in my pocket without me reacting. That's how fast it was, just seconds,' he added. Mr Dunham's threatening stance caused Jones to back off and say: 'I was just kidding'. After sizing Jones up, Mr Dunham decided he needed to get help and entered the adjacent Bank of America branch where a teller called 911. Encounter: Dunham (left) was just finishing up breakfast when he passed Jones (right) on the street near a Bank of America branch in suburban Detroit . Artful Dodger?

Police soon arrived and arrested Jones outside the restaurant where Mr Dunham had just finished eating breakfast. After he was arrested, Jones told authorities he was in the area for a doctor's appointment and was waiting for a ride home. 'I believe that to be true. But, whatever the reason he committed that act, I'm still not sure.' Detective Bryan Ford told Grosse Point News. A review of the surveillance footage shows Jones was lingering in the same area for some 20 minutes before choosing Dunham as his target. 'He thought he was going to be an easy target but obviously he wasn't,' Detective Bryan Ford said. 'This guy's no Jack-be-nimble,' fellow Detective Lt Richard Rosati added. Jones admitted to trying to steal the old man's wallet, and has since been charged with attempted larceny of a person - a five-year felony. He is being held on $5,000 bond at Wayne County Jail. Authorities say Jones is unemployed and lives with his mother and younger brother. He quit high school halfway through the 11th grade because 'it was too difficult'.","Chet Dunham, 72, had just finished breakfast on March 27 when Jeffrey Darnell Jones II tried to steal his wallet .

"Sex symbol: Former actress Gina Lollobrigida was once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world' after starring in a film of the same name . An Italian film actress, once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world', has become involved in a bizarre legal battle with her former fiancé claiming he 'married' another woman pretending to be her. Gina Lollobrigida, 85, was one of the sex symbols of her day with sultry starring roles alongside Frank Sinatra and Humphrey Bogart during the 1950s and 60s. But she has become entangled in real-life love scandal of her own after allegedly discovering that her ex partner, Spanish businessman Javier Rigau y Rafols, married an imposter in a bid to lay claim to her estate when she dies. 'This vile person married me by . proxy, without my knowledge and without my permission, in order to . inherit my estate after my death,' she told the Italian media today. 'There will be international investigations because I want to shed light on this squalid affair and all the people involved.' Ms Lollobrigida accused Mr Rafols, who is 34 years younger, of being able to carry out the fraud because he had obtained legal powers to act on her behalf. 'A while ago he convinced me to give him . my power of attorney. He needed it for some legal affairs. But instead I . fear that he took advantage of the fact that I don't understand . Spanish...Who knows what he had me sign,' she said. The fake marriage allegedly took . place three years ago, but she only found out about it by chance this . week when she came across legal records on the internet. 'I found a document in which it seems . that in November 2010 he became my husband, in Barcelona, in front of . eight witnesses. It is incredible. At the altar there was another woman, . a certain Teresa,' she said. Real-life drama: Ms Lollobrigida claims her former boyfriend, Spanish businessman Javier Rigau y Rafols, pictured together left, 'married' an imposter claiming to be her in Spain three years ago . A member of her staff, who identified . himself as Carlo, confirmed to The Daily Telegraph today that she was . planning to launch legal action against her former toy boy. 'She's very angry. She considers him to be a vulture. A very strange affair,' he said. The couple met at a party in Monte Carlo in 1984 and had at one point been engaged. But the marriage was called off in 2006 and the pair split. It would have been her second wedding, following her 1971 divorce from Yugoslavian-born doctor Milko Skofic. The former actress has known Spanish businessman Javier Ragau y Rafols for more than 20 years but the pair reportedly split in 2006 . The former screen idol starred alongside Humphrey Bogart and Frank Sinatra in the 1950s and 60s . Mr Rafols was reported as having said at the time he would 'always love and respect' Ms Lollobrigida. But on Sunday she made a formal complaint to Carabinieri police in Rome and is threatening legal action. The former screen idol has since turned her skills towards art in recent years, first in photography and later sculpting. Lollobrigida began making movies in Italy just after the end of World War II. Her screen credits include 'The World's Most Beautiful Woman,' 'Come September,' 'Trapeze,' 'Bread, Love and Dreams' and 'Never So Few'.","Gina Lollobrigida, 85, claims ex-partner Javier Rigau y Rafols, 51, married a woman pretending to be her in Spain three years ago .

"The websites of leading retailers crashed today as five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up Black Friday deals online. Tesco,  Argos, and Curry's all had problems with their websites this morning with thousands of internet users rushing to buy cut-priced goods. More than 40,000 people were shopping when discounted televisions, gadgets and clothing became available at midnight, with scores more expected to inundate websites at lunchtime. Scroll down for video . Tesco Direct was still unavailable this afternoon as hundreds of thousands of people tried to place orders . Later the company updated its website's background, though it was still inaccessible to shoppers . Online transactions were expected to rise by 22 per cent compared to last year, with 8.5million items being bought virtually. Visa Europe forecasts that £360,000 will be spent every minute today online and in shops, but that December 1 holds even more promise for online retailers. More than £500million is expected to be spent on the day known as Cyber Monday, contributing to an overall forecast of more than £1billion for British businesses over the weekend, according to the credit card company. Less conservatively, the Centre for Retail Research predicted online sales of £556million today, making a total of £1.6billion once added to store sales. The organisation projected that £2million-a-minute would be spent. Several retail websites buckled under the pressure of increased traffic. Among them was Argos whose website crashed as as 17,000 people visited the site every minute between 8 and 9am. 'To ensure customers get the best possible experience, we've had to limit the number of visitors entering at any one time, so some customers may experience a delay,' a spokesman said. 'We're really sorry about this and we are reminding customers that they can still buy at any of our 700+ stores nationwide.' Asda was temporarily unavailable while Tesco Direct has not been able to process orders since early this morning. Topshop, who is offering 50 per cent off selected items, crashed this afternoon while Best Buy has not been operating well all day. Argos also suffered technical difficulties this morning after being inundated with hits but is now working . Curry's was still experiencing issues this afternoon and was issuing queue numbers for online shoppers . More than double the number of online transactions were carried out by 10am today than on Black Friday last year according to Postcode Anywhere . Curry's was dolling out queue numbers for online customers. At 2pm the estimated waiting time to browse stock was 25 minutes. Vast numbers of consumers were shopping from tablets and mobile phones instead of computers. More than 70 per cent of PC World's customers used handheld devices. Jeremy Fennell, e-Commerce Director at Currys PC World, said: 'We've seen astonishing demand online and implemented a pre-planned queuing system to most fairly support shoppers. 'We are continuing to implement our queuing system while shoppers take advantage of our great deals online and in-store. 'Across the country we've seen customers ready to shop with queues outside a number of stores, but everything has been very well organised and in good spirits, with no reported incidents. 'This has been our biggest Black Friday ever with web traffic up five-fold and transactions peaking at eight per second from stores and online combined.' According to experts, Black Friday has seen its busiest year in history in Britain. Creeping up on the British consumer last year following historic success in America, few retailers took part in deals last year. More have joined in however, and the increase in profit will be 'exponential' for the economy, experts said. Patrick O'Brien, retail analyst at Verdict Retail, said: 'Some of the offers are in-store only, some are online only and there are sizable discounts on them. 'It's way bigger than last year. We don't yet have numbers but there are more than double the number retailers on board, it's exponentially larger.' Cyber Monday is expected to see even more spending. 'Mega Monday, which used to be the biggest online shopping day, will reach its own new high this year, surpassing £500m,' said Kevin Jenkins, Managing Director UK & Ireland at Visa Europe. 'Altogether we're looking at a £1.7bn Cyber Weekend,' he added . At 10am, more than 40,000 people were shopping online in Britain. Online sales at midnight were 130% higher than Black Friday last year, and three times the number than 12am on Thursday according to figures obtained by Postcode Anywhere. While around 3,300 transactions are normally processed at this time, more than 9,000 were carried out last night. At 1am, sales were increased by almost 500% between 9,000 online retailers including Tesco, Boots, Reiss and various UK department stores. Online traffic collated by Postcode Anywhere also suggested that figures would grow higher at lunchtime. 'Our data shows that as the clock struck midnight, more spenders than ever hit the online sales to bag the best bargains,' said Guy Mucklow, CEO and Co-Founder of the company. 'Our real-time spending tracker shows that the UK's most dedicated shoppers are based in our cities, especially Birmingham, Belfast and Glasgow where the highest number of orders were placed online between midnight and 8am. 'With online shopping traffic set to continue to rise, we are urging retailers to ensure they are making the most of their own data to better serve the needs of their customers.' Most online shopping was being done in Birmingham, Belfast, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle this morning, with most internet users buying televisions, computers and phones. Amazon has not revealed yet revealed any figures for this year's sales, though more than 4million transactions were carried out online on Black Friday 2013. While many websites struggled to cope with the demand of increased traffic, stores were also inundated with impatient crowds desperate to get their hands on a bargain. Kate O’Brien Marketing Director, Daisy Group Plc, advised retailers to be prepared for sudden spikes in online traffic and overwhelming numbers of shoppers. 'Retailers participating in the new ‘Black Friday’ trend are understandably experiencing high volumes of traffic to their websites, some have seen their website traffic increase by a few hundred percent. 'To avoid their websites slowing down at a business-critical time, businesses must ensure they have the right IT infrastructure in place to deal with any spikes in demand they may experience. 'One of the most obvious ways for them to do that is to make a greater use of the cloud. When retailers need additional resources, they can scale the service up or down immediately at the click of a button, ensuring business continues as normal.' Online electrical goods retailer ao.com said today is likely to be its busiest ever, with sales up to five times higher than last year's Black Friday. Shortly after 3.45pm today, an estimated £340,000,000 had been spent according to search and digital agency Branded3.","Tesco, Argos, Asda  and Curry's websites crashed this morning .

"Violent lout: Michael Brown, 27, boasted that he ‘didn’t even get community service’ after his trial . A violent lout did a jig outside court after being spared jail for beating his girlfriend. Michael Brown, 27, boasted that he ‘didn’t even get community service’ after his trial. But his victim has accused the ‘soft’ judge who let him walk free of ruining people’s lives. Her comments will heap further pressure on Judge George Moorhouse, who has already been accused of misconduct by three police and crime commissioners. They have highlighted a number of cases in which he has failed to send domestic abusers to prison, claiming that such decisions can force victims into hiding. Ceri Daniel, 24, suffered head injuries and cuts all over her upper body after being punched and kicked by Brown in January. The terrified victim said the judge’s failure to jail the attacker after the trial in July left her with no choice but to flee her home town, as she was so petrified of meeting him. She said: ‘Judge Moorhouse ruins people’s lives without even knowing he is doing it. He should not be a judge at all. He makes the victims prisoners, not the perpetrators.’ Miss Daniel was beaten after inviting her former partner of seven years to her house. During the attack, he also assaulted two of her friends. He pleaded guilty to three counts of assault and was given a three-month suspended sentence, put on a domestic violence programme and told to pay £550 compensation to his victims. Attacked: Brown's former girlfriend Ceri Daniel suffered a bruised eye, head injuries, and cuts to her shoulders and arms during Brown's brutal assault in January 2013 . Terrified victim: Miss Daniel said the judge’s failure to jail the attacker after the trial in July left her with no choice but to flee her home town, as she was so petrified of meeting him . But Miss Daniel said her ex, the father of her two children, had been left thinking ‘the justice system is a laugh’. She added: ‘There is no justice, no deterrent. ‘My life has been turned upside down, while Michael’s has carried on as normal.’ Judge George Moorhouse, who has been criticised by victims for the 'soft sentences' he imposes . Speaking about her decision to leave her home town of Middlesbrough, she said: ‘He lived close by and I was petrified of bumping into him. I became a prisoner in my own home.’ The case is one of a number of trials in which it is alleged that Judge Moorhouse, who sits at Teesside Crown Court, has ‘failed to deliver justice for the public’. Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird and fellow commissioners Barry Coppinger and Ron Hogg in Cleveland and Durham have compiled a dossier of suspect cases. The trio have called for the judge to be investigated and written to the Judicial Appointments and Conduct Ombudsman to complain. They were driven to act following the trial of Anthony Bruce, 34, who was given a mere 12-month suspended sentence after beating his wife, holding a knife to her throat and shooting her in the foot with a pellet gun. Their accusations were initially rejected by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, which said there was no evidence of misconduct and that it could not look at sentencing issues.","Michael Brown boasted he 'didn’t even get community service' after trial .

"A Wall Street do-gooder whose weapon of choice is the short sell has waged war on companies engaged in fraud as the 'Batman' of the financial markets. Styling himself after the Dark Knight, Daniel Yu, a 32-year-old investor linked to the firm Gotham City Research, has gone up against several corporations and won. Gotham City Research's strategy is to perform 'due diligence-based, special situation investing,' which in practice means short selling targeted companies then publicizing the fraud. Activist: Taking his inspiration from Batman, Daniel Yu, a 32-year-old investor linked to the firm Gotham City Research, has gone up against several corporations and won . In April, Gotham went after Quindell, a British firm, alleging that '42%-80% of Quindell's profits are suspect' in a report unceremoniously tweeted one morning. 'Quindell was little more than a country club until 2008/2009,' the report continues, but began reporting 'Google-esque' profit margins two years later. After the report was published, the outsourcing and consulting corporation's stock price tumbled 39 percent in a single day according to Bloomberg. Quindell's chief exec later resigned, along with the company's finance director and a third employee, after several other missteps. Yu has been hesitant to reveal too much of his identity, not wanting to open himself up to the animosity that short selling can attract. Instead of Wayne Manor, Yu hides out in his home on Staten Island, the New York Post reports. Apart from his MIT education and work as a hedge-fund analyst, little is known about his life. Crusader: Yu's stance is that authorities and regulators often lack the resources to go after bad actors, leaving the work up to activist investors like Gotham City Research . On July 1, Gotham struck again, alleging that Spanish telecom Gowex could legitimately claim only around 10 percent of the sales they reported on the books. Stock fell 46 percent and a week later, the firm was filing for insolvency, its chief executive officer resigning and admitting the last four years of financial results were fraudulent. 'If you pay close attention to Batman, he always worked within the spirit and the letter of the law,' Yu told Bloomberg by phone (the media shy investor denied the Post an interview). 'He’s not a vigilante. He realizes that the authorities have scarce resources and limited personnel. We are driven by the desire to show people that the world doesn’t belong to seemingly untouchable wrong-doers.' Yu reportedly soured on the financial markets after a big bet in  Freddie Mac went bust along with the mortgage lender in 2008. Gotham, which has also gone after tech stocks Ebix and Blucora, as well as Tile Shop Holdings, has not disclosed how much it has made off its pursuit of deceitful corporations. The practice is similar to other small short sellers, such as Carson Block's Muddy Waters, which targets 'inflated' Chinese corporations. Block reportedly visited one targeted company, Olam, back in 2012, disguised in street clothes and a baseball cap and claiming to be a hedge fund investor, the Financial Times reports. Block's publicised pursuit of the commodities and supply chain service helped knock 21 percent off the share price. Online, Yu alternates between discussing weaknesses in the financial markets and tweeting Martin Luther King, Jr, and Bible quotes. 'It seems that if one truly cares about justice, one must be equally concerned about plight of poor, oppressed, etc., as the falsely accused,' he recently opined from behind the veil of his Twitter. An earlier version of this article stated that Gotham had ‘brought down’ outsourcing company Quindell. We are happy to clarify that while Gotham City research investigated its practices, Quindell continues to operate. We apologise for any contrary suggestion.","Daniel Yu, 32, and his firm Gotham Research forced Spanish Wi-Fi service Gowex to admit to filing fraudulent financial records .

"Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho have questioned Manchester City’s £25million capture of Wilfried Bony, amid claims the Premier League champions may have bent the rules to sign the Ivory Coast striker. Ahead of Arsenal’s clash with City at the Etihad on Sunday, Wenger admitted he was ‘surprised’ that his opponents have been able to buy Bony from Swansea despite being limited to a £49m net transfer spend imposed by UEFA for breaking Financial Fair Play regulations. Chelsea manager Mourinho went a step further by claiming that the rules are different for title rivals City compared to other clubs, now that Manuel Pellegrini has added Bony to his £90m strikeforce of Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic.

Well done.’ Wenger expressed surprise at the Bony deal as well as the manner in which City signed former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard for the season, having originally stated that he was joining them on a short-term loan from their sister club New York City FC. Asked if signing Bony was ethical, the Arsenal manager said: ‘I hope so. ‘They must have the availability and the Financial Fair Play allows them to do it. I don’t know. It was a surprise, yes. They have huge financial potential now for a lot of years and we know that. Arsene Wenger hopes the deal to take Bony to Manchester City is ethical . ‘It is part of our game and we have to deal with it. ‘It’s not down to me to control it. There are official people to do that. I don’t know enough about what they do. It’s not my job as well to judge that.’ On the Lampard issue, Wenger added: ‘I’m surprised the way it happened because it was told that he first signed for New York and after he didn’t. It’s strange.’ Wenger was surprised that Manchester City were able to sign Frank Lampard until the end of the season . Although the Bony fee pushes City’s spending over the £49m mark, the club have offset it against the £25m they will bank from Valencia when Alvaro Negredo’s loan move becomes permanent in the summer. Pellegrini refused to be drawn on Mourinho’s comments, but insisted that there is more to City then just lavish spending. ‘I didn’t hear what he said and it’s not important for me,’ said the City boss. ‘But I don’t think this club or this team is just money. ‘Every team needs good players if they want to win important things. ‘But after that, the way we play is very important.’","Manchester City signed £25million striker Wilfried Bony on Wednesday .

"Three pitch invaders arrested after they disrupted a Tottenham Hotspur match last night have been revealed as YouTube stars making films that aim to 'offend and harass the general public'. Gomes Garcia, Nathan Brown and Dan Jarvis  are the founders  of TrollStation, a controversial prank group with 100,000 subscribers whose videos have been seen by millions worldwide. Last night all three men ran onto the White Hart Lane pitch during the Europa League match with Partizan Belgrade, and at one point the referee took the teams off the pitch for ten minutes. All three men are still in custody after being arrested following the pitch invasion and one of the three men was also arrested for handling stolen goods. They all wore T-shirts promoting audio manufacturers BassBuds, whose official Tottenham headphones have been pulled down from the club's online  store today. Scroll down for video . In custody: Dan Jarvis (left), Gomes Garcia (centre) and Nathan Brown (right) stormed on to the pitch during Tottenham's Europa League clash with Partizan Belgrade last night and are in custody today . Trouble: Tottenham's clash was interrupted three times by the pitch invaders, which led the game being temporarily suspended for ten minutes . Action: Spurs midfielder Mousa Dembele attempts to stop Jarvis, with the trio wearing 'BassBuds' t-shirts, and police confirmed no action we be taken against the players who tacked them . The gang's previous stunts include turning a Tube carriage into a strip club, faking a kidnapping and one film where a black man is kept as a slave and whipped in the street. Message: Two days ago one of the group's founders tweeted this picture holding a picture of Nathan Brown holding a YouTube award . One member also pretended to take cocaine in public places and another confronted comedian Russell Brand at a 'People Before Profit' rally he organised. Police have also been called to speak to them on a number of occasions. Before their latest prank at Spurs, Garcia, Brown and Jarvis filmed themselves boasting about how they would disrupt the match and also chanted 'Yid Army' - a controversial phrase linked to Spurs' Jewish support which some consider anti-Semitic. The trio ran on to the pitch during the first-half of the Europa League match, attempting to take selfies with the Tottenham players and evading stewards who tried to catch them. After the third pitch invasion, referee Yevgen Aranovsky led the players into the tunnel for several minutes on safety grounds. BassBuds issued a statement via Facebook condemning their actions, adding: 'We are appalled that the game was interrupted in this manner. We do not condone the interruption of any sporting fixture in this way.' Despite this, Spurs severed links with the company after the stunt and could well take legal action if they are found to have links to it. UEFA confirmed on Friday afternoon that they have opened disciplinary proceedings against Tottenham. A tweet by the Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrest of the three pitch invaders - they added that one of the three was also arrested for handling stolen goods . Upset: Roberto Soldado did not take kindly to the second pitch invader Garcia, ripping his shirt off in anger . BassBuds, a sponsor linked with Spurs, denied they had anything to do with the incident . Garcia was one of the pranksters disrupting a Russell Brand monologue earlier this month . TrollStation also posted a video on their YouTube where they set up a 'strip club' on the London Underground . Garcia had his shirt ripped off by Soldado, before the stewards eventually caught him . Brown runs gleefully onto the pitch displaying the BassBuds logo on his top . The TrollStation video, uploaded to YouTube late on Thursday night, starts with Gomes introducing the prank and his fellow pitch invaders 'Nathan' and 'Jarvis'. He says: 'Today we're going to see who lasts longer on the pitch.' The three pitch invasions are then filmed from the stands, in breach of the ticket terms. Nathan is the first to run on to the pitch, making his way past Jan Vertonghen before stopping to pose for a selfie with a frustrated Kyle Naughton. He then runs past Benjamin Stambouli before  the orange-vested stewards catch him as the crowd egg him on. From their YouTube channel . 'Trollstation a Online Hidden Camera Prank Show Created By DigiDanTv : Our content is intentionally provocative & controversial with the aim to offend and harass the general public in the name of comedic Satire. 'Trollstation is a collective of social misfits playing mad ASBO games on the public.' Gomes is the second prankster to run on to the field, evading security all too easily. He has his shirt pulled off by Roberto Soldado but continues bare-chested before being dragged to the ground by stewards. Dan Jarvis, the third to run on, sends a steward flying as he climbs over the sponsor boards but is wrestled to the ground by Mousa Dembele. It is at this point the referee leads the players off. In a statement published on their website, Tottenham confirmed: 'Three pitch invaders at tonight's match have been arrested and are assisting police with their enquiries. 'We apologise to fans for the disruptions caused by this totally unacceptable behaviour.' YouTube are also considering their response, MailOnline understands. The match, which eventually finish 1-0 to the hosts, was suspended after the events . One of the men who ran onto the pitch was tweeting about it on Wednesday evening . 'Tonight my cojones will be put to the test,' he wrote, hours before disrupting the game at White Hart Lane . Brown is filmed by YouTube account TrollStation storming on to the pitch as Jan Vertonghen watches on . The match resumed after a short delay and Tottenham won 1-0, sealing their passage to the knockout stage of the competition. The TrollStation Twitter account posted about the prank on Friday morning, calling for the trio to be released from custody. The Metropolitan Police confirmed to Sportsmail that the three men were arrested at the match and remained in custody. Another tweet suggested a repeat performance, saying: 'The questions is Emirates Stadium or Stamford Bridge?' They had hinted a prank was imminent ahead of the event, with Gomes Garcia tweeting on Thursday afternoon: 'Tonight my cojones will be put to the test.' They even apologised to BassBuds in one tweet afterwards, saying they 'had to do it... we support Arsenal'. The trio have gained a large online following for their pranks, racking up thousands of YouTube views. BassBuds sell official Tottenham merchandise, but the club have deleted products from their club shop . TrollStation were tweeting before the events, saying they were Arsenal fans, and 'planning' their next venture . Mousa Dembele tackles Jarvis to the floor as he sprinted onto the White Hart Lane pitch . A prank last month, which saw them seal off part of a London Underground carriage as a strip dancing club, attracted over 200,000 views on YouTube. Free lap dances were offered to passangers travelling on a Northern Line train through central London with the 'strip club' coming complete with bouncers and a velvet rope. Another prank saw Nathan dancing wildly to techno track 'Sandstorm' by Darude on an Underground platform as unimpressed commuters watched on in bemusement. They also ambushed Russell Brand at one of his recent protests and hid in the changing rooms at a Kent leisure centre so they could ride the flumes after it closed. They also faked kidnappings in a supermarket, a mobile phone shop and a bus stop, complete with 'gangsters' in black balaclavas and hoodies, who bundled the 'victim' into the boot of a car. Dan Jarvis posted a video on his Facebook page after staying in a leisure centre after hours last month .","Gomes Garcia, Nathan Brown and Dan Jarvis arrested by Scotland Yard .

"Hundreds of people were fighting eachother on the streets of Athens during a food giveaway, prompting an outcry over the growing desperation created by economic crisis. Farmers protesting against government cuts gave away 50 tonnes of free vegetables and fruit in the Greek capital earlier today, causing chaos in the streets as impoverished and hungry people elbowed their way to the stalls. Startling images of Greeks struggling to seize bags of tomatoes and leeks thrown from a truck outside the Agriculture Ministry have sparked further debate about poverty in the debt-ridden nation. Desperation: A man tries to reach higher than his competitors as hundreds of people scramble to get their hands on the free vegetables given away in Athens today . ‘These images make me angry. Angry for a proud people who have no food to eat, who can't afford to keep warm, who can't make ends meet,’ said Kostas Barkas, a lawmaker from the left-wing Syriza party. Other lawmakers from across the political spectrum decried the images ‘of people on the brink of despair’ and the sense of ‘sadness for a proud people who have ended up like this’. The living standards in Greece have dropped significantly since the collapse of their economy and as the nation enters its sixth year in recession, unemployment is at a record high. In order to avoid bankruptcy, the country has been forced to push through painful wage and pension cuts demanded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund bankrolling the bailouts. Dire situation: An elderly woman holds on to a bag of oranges as she is nearly elbowed in the back of her head outside the Agriculture Ministry in Athens . Taking action: Greek farmers give away fruit and vegetables to down-and-out citizens as part of their protest against high production costs, earlier today . Hunger: A woman fills a plastic bag with vegetables as others reach for morsels from the trucks . Free-for-all: Many had queued for hours before the farmers arrived and as word spread of the giveaway the crowd became desperate and one man was injured . Clamour: The farmers were handing out their goods from trucks and tables throwing the scraps into the crowds as they started to run out . The free food handout in Athens began peacefully as hundreds of Greeks lined up in advance outside the Agriculture Ministry. Farmers had announced the giveaway as part of their ten-day protest against Greece's conservative-led coalition government's plans to increase taxation on agriculture. They also demand that the government reduce the price of fuel and cut sales tax on their goods. However the peaceful good-will protest soon escalated into chaos as the tables piled high with fruit and vegetables began to thin. Protest: The farmers want Greece's conservative-led coalition government to reduce the price of fuel, scrap plans to increase taxation on agriculture and cut sales tax on their goods . Large haul: Dozens of hands reach out for a bag of oranges as farmers gave away more than 50 tons of fruit and vegetables . Scraps: A woman and a young child  reach for the last broken tomatoes on a table . Tensions flared as dozens of people - . some carrying small children - rushed to a nearby truck and shoved each . other out of the way in the competition for what was left. One man was treated for injuries after being trampled when he fell to the ground in the commotion. Greeks lamented that income cuts and tax hikes had made the cost of living unbearable, forcing them to seek out free food. ‘It's difficult. I never imagined that I would end up here,’ said Panagiota Petropoulos, 65, who struggles to get by on her 530-euro monthly pension while paying 300 euros in rent. ‘I can't afford anything, not even at the fruit market. Everything is expensive, prices of everything are going up while our income is going down and there are no jobs.’","Vegetables and fruits were handed out by farmers in Athens today .

I sure don't want no kids getting eat up by some wild hogs,' said 64-year-old hog catcher Jerry Campbell in the latest episode of American Hoggers on Wednesday. With over 50 years’ experience, Mr Cambell and his family specialize in hunting the area's growing feral hog population estimated in the state to be at three million. Costing Texas annually $50 million in damages, the invasive species of pig regularly terrorizes residents and ranches. As the programme states: 'Anything that weighs up to 400lbs, runs at 30 mph and eats its own young is no joke.' Assessing: Jerry Campbells, with over 50 years of experience hunting hogs, is seen meeting with the family at their home which he describes as being up against some of the worst swamp country he's seen . Caught: After a hunt through the home's surrounding marshes, a 260lb wild hog is seen after its capture by the Campbell family .

"For aviation buffs, it's the trip of a lifetime. A warplane heritage museum is auctioning off the opportunity to fly in a famous Second World War bomber on eBay. The winner of the trip - in one of the only two remaining airworthy Lancasters left in the world - will have to fork out £25,000 for the unique journey, travelling from Canada to England over four days. The 18-hour trip - the last time the Lancaster Mk X will make the flight - will take place in August, according to the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, which is selling the unique opportunity. Final flight: Munson will be on-board as this Lancaster makes its last journey from Canada to the UK .

Somebody must have this on their bucket list.' The cash to join the crew of seven others will be put towards the £380,000 cost of the trip in what is considered to be the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War. The Avro Lancaster Mk X - dedicated to Andrew Mynarski, the last Canadian airman to be awarded the VC in World War II - will be involved in a month-long flying tour of the UK. It will be teaming up with the Royal Air Force's Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Lancaster - the first time the world's last two airworthy Lancaster bombers have flown together - before returning home to Hamilton in September.

Mr Rohrer, a current Lancaster pilot, said: 'A rare window of opportunity was identified to bring the only two flying Lancasters in the world together as a special salute to all the veterans of Bomber Command, many of whom are in their late 80's or older now.' The Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum website added: 'It is also an opportunity for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum to fly together and showcase a flying display and tribute to all those who served in the time of need, in Canada, England, and the entire Commonwealth that likely will never be seen again.' The Avro Lancaster is one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft. It . is most famous for its involvement in the Dambuster raids, which saw 19 . Lancasters attack German dams with Sir Barnes Wallis's 'bouncing bombs' in 1943. The plane was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum - which features the aircraft used by Canada from World War II until today - in 1978, when it underwent a 10-year restoration, and has remained airworthy since 1988. Officer Commanding the RAF Battle of . Britain Memorial Flight, Sqn Ldr Dunc Mason said: 'To see these two . aircraft flying at events together will be a unique sight and also the . opportunity to truly commemorate those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.

The winner will be flying in the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum's Lancaster Mk X, which was built at Victory Aircraft, Malton, Canada, in July 1945. The plane is dedicated to the memory of Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski who was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Canadian Mynarski won the award on June 13, 1944, when his Lancaster was shot down in flames by a German night fighter during the Second World War. As the bomber fell, Mynarski managed to free the tail gunner trapped in the rear turret of the blazing and out-of-control aircraft before he died. The crew member survived and lived to . tell the tale, resulting in the Victoria Cross being awarded in 1946 - . the last such award to a Canadian airman in the Second World War. The . Lancaster bomber, which is flying to the UK in August, was dedicated to . Mynarski, and is referred to as the 'Mynarski Memorial Lancaster'. It is painted in the colours of his aircraft KB726 – VR-A, which flew with RCAF Squadron. Unique opportunity: The passengers will fly alongside the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War . In . 1952, it suffered a serious accident and received a replacement wing . centre section from a Lancaster that had flown in combat over Germany. It served as a maritime patrol aircraft in Newfoundland for many years and was retired from the RCAF in late 1963. With help from the Sulley Foundation in 1977, it was acquired from the Royal Canadian Legion in Goderich, Ontario, where it had been on outside display. Eleven years passed before it was completely restored and flew again on September 24, 1988.","Winning bidder will make four-day trip in famous Second World War plane .

"The West fears Russia is poised to invade Ukraine, but it seems the Kremlin has a bigger conquest in its sights - the Moon. Moscow today set out plans to conquer and colonise space, including a permanent manned moon base. Deputy premier Dmitry Rogozin said: 'We are coming to the moon forever.' His comments came as President Vladimir Putin toured the Cosmonautics Memorial Museum in Moscow. On Saturday, Russia celebrates Cosmonaut Day marking Yuri Gagarin's pioneering flight into space on April 12, 1961. Moon mission: Vladimir Putin (left) looks at exhibits as he visits the Cosmonautics Memorial Museum in Russia. Currently, Russia has plans to launch three lunar spacecraft - two to the surface and one to orbit - by the end of the decade . President Putin was taking the tour as one of his deputy premiers, Dmitry Rogozin, claimed that Russia had an eye on the Moon once again . The Russian President enjoyed the visit while with a group of children. Currently Russia has plans to launch three lunar spacecraft - two to the surface and one to orbit - byt he end of the decade . The final frontier: A Russian Soyuz rocket takes off for the International Space Station last month. The Kremlin has announced plans to o build a super-heavy carrier rocket that will propel its cosmonauts to Mars . In an article in the government's own newspaper headlined 'Russian Space', he spoke of targeting Mars and other 'space objects' as future priorities. 'Flights to Mars and asteroids in our view do not contradict exploration of the moon, but in many senses imply this process.' He wrote of 'colonisation of the moon and near-moon space'. In the next 50 years, manned flights are unlikely beyond 'the space between Venus and Mars'. 'We are coming to the Moon forever': Russian deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin first outlined his country's plans for lunar exploration and colonisation last month . But 'it is quite possible to speak about exploration of Mars, flights to asteroids and flights to Mars'. The essential first step as a base for research and experiments was the moon, said Rogozin, who is in overall charge of Russia's space and defence industries, and was recently targeted for EU and US sanctions over the Ukrainian crisis. 'The moon is not an intermediate point in the race,' he wrote in official daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta, conjuring an impression of a new space race with America. 'It is a separate, even a self-contained goal. 'It would hardly be rational to make some ten or 20 flights to the moon, and then wind it all up and fly to the Mars or some asteroids. 'This process has the beginning, but has no end. We are coming to the moon forever.' Currently, Russia has plans to launch three lunar spacecraft - two to the surface and one to orbit - by the end of the decade. The first mission, the long-delayed Luna-25, is slated for launch in 2016, to research the moon's  south pole. The next two missions will include an orbiter to monitor the moon in 2018, and a year later a polar lander with a drill will search for water ice. The Kremlin's space-age boasts come less than three years after the U.S. was forced to start hitching flights on Russian rockets. Nasa ended its space shuttle programme in 2011 and has faced years of funding cuts. Just two weeks ago a Soyuz rocket carried two Russian cosmonauts and a U.S. astronaut to the International Space Station (above), despite the crisis in Crimea. But there could be hope of a new space race - as Nasa announced this week it hopes to land humans on Mars within 20 years. By 2040, Russia plans to create a lunar base for long-term missions to the Earth's natural satellite. Rogozin said that the moon is the only . realistic source to obtain water, minerals and other resources for . future space missions. A lunar laboratory complex will also be used for . testing new space technologies. He promised the development of  'a super-heavy rocket for lunar missions and to the Mars in the future'. Rogozin claimed sanctions including the termination of space cooperation announced by the US 'can contribute' to a stronger Russian space industry. It will force Russia 'to create a strategy of development of Russian manned space flights, independent from unreliable international partners'. He stressed: 'We should not be afraid to dream, to raise the bar as high as possible for our future development. 'Russia has everything needed for a new breakthrough in space research. 'All we need is to learn how to combine idealism and pragmatism and how to properly organise our business.' Surface area: 6.6million square miles . Population: 144million . Maximum temperature: 44C .

"For male chimpanzees, there . may be a benefit to being a bully. A study of chimpanzees in . Tanzania spanning 17 years found that males that subjected . females to long-term aggressive behavior, often including . physical attacks, greatly improved their chances of fathering . babies with them. 'It is certainly not a happy message,' said Arizona State . University evolutionary anthropologist Ian Gilby, one of the . researchers. Scroll down for video . A dominant male chimpanzee feeds in Kibale National Park tropical rain forest, 354km southeast of Uganda's capital Kampala. Scientists said a 17-year study of chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe National Park found that males that subjected females to long-term bullying including physical attacks improved their chances of fathering babies with them. 'Males who directed aggression toward females at high rates . were more likely to sire those females' offspring than less . violent males were. 'This effect was particularly strong for high . ranking males (in the chimpanzee community),' Gilby added. The study involved an ape species that is a close genetic . cousin of humans but the researchers were wary about making . conclusions about the origins of sexual violence in people. The researchers knew from detailed long-term observations of . this chimp community in Tanzania's Gombe National Park which . ones had mated with one another as well as the paternity of 31 . babies born during the study period from 1995 through 2011 based . on DNA collected from fecal matter. 'The hypothesis is that females are intimidated by long-term . aggression from the male so that they acquiesce or even solicit . mating from the male when they are fertile, and avoid mating . with other males in his presence for fear of further aggression . from the male,' said Duke University evolutionary anthropologist . Anne Pusey, one of the researchers. Male chimps  that subjected females to long-term aggressive behavior, often including physical attacks, greatly improved their chances of fathering babies with them. The aggressive behavior by the males included violent . physical attacks including biting and striking that sometimes . caused wounds as well as chasing the female and engaging in . outbursts in which the male charges and strikes nearby foliage. Mating did not take place during or immediately after the . bullying. In fact, it was serial aggressive behavior over two or . three years that was particularly effective in later securing . fatherhood. The researchers found that females at their time of peak . fertility actively sought to mate with the males that bullied . them. The researchers noted that the evolutionary lineage for . humans and chimps split some 7 million years ago and that the . mating systems for the two species are different. 'Nevertheless, recognizing the adaptive value of male-female . aggression in chimpanzees may inevitably help us to understand, . and hopefully prevent, similar behavior among humans,' Gilby . said. The research was published in the scientific journal Current . Biology.","Study of chimpanzees in Tanzania spanned 17 years .

"A children's playground has been left looking like a 'battleground' after wild boar began grazing on the land. The animals have repeatedly churned up the ground and left the site unsafe and dangerously uneven. Council leaders are now considering installing anti-boar fencing to ward off the animals. Wild boar (left) in Forest of Dean, Glos. are attracted to fresh food source by play area (right) where kids use swings and climb, leaving uneven ground which a forestry chief says is a danger to both children and adults . The recent attacks have been blamed on the soaring boar population in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and homeowners in Lydney say their gardens have also been damaged. Ian Harvey, wildlife manager for the Forestry Commission, said: 'The play equipment is well used and there's always the concern that a child or adult could turn their feet badly on the uneven ground. 'It's an area the boar have expanded into to feed. If they find an area which has a good source of food they will keep coming back. 'In the forest we've seen this repeatedly on grass verges outside homes, and it upsets a lot of people. 'We've always had issues like this with the boar but more problems are being caused as their numbers go up.' A Lydney town council spokesman said it cannot control the wild boar, but they can do everything possible to limit the damage they cause. Deputy mayor of Lydney Brian Thomas said the town council is looking at installing fencing with mesh to prevent the boar from breaking through. The recent attacks on the land (pictured) have been blamed on the soaring boar population in the Forest of Dean, and a forestry chief says their numbers will continue to grow because there has been a lack of culling . He said: 'The play area looks like a battleground and the grass has been eaten more consistently in the last two months. 'Lumps of grass and earth have appeared and it's not very good for walking or running in. It's no longer fit for purpose. 'We're going to attempt to fence the area off from the forest, but it's not registered land so we can't surround it completely.' A Lydney town council spokesman said the installing anti-boar fencing would cost thousands of pounds and would delay other projects such as the proposed new play equipment on the site. Residents in Lydney (pictured) have had their gardens damaged by the beasts. The town council has said a fence to ward the animals away will cost thousands of pounds and will damage budgets for the community . The wild boar population in Forest of Dean is constantly growing and there is no sign their numbers will fall. The animals are prolific breeders, and young females have litter sizes of eight to ten. Those animals will then go on to have their own offspring the following year. The wild boar do not have any predators, which is another reason their numbers are a problem. Mr Harvey, senior wildlife manager for the commission, said: 'We have not been culling enough and the population continues to increase year on year. 'It is quite simple to see how the population can quickly escalate and it is fairly common in Europe.'","Beasts are roaming onto area beside where kids climb and use swings .

"Insurgents killed six Afghan soldiers in an assault on Camp Bastion that lasted more than 14 hours, a day after attacks on foreign targets in Kabul killed two British embassy employees. Nearly 30 insurgents, including seven suicide bombers, swarmed the camp in southern Helmand province in the early hours of Friday morning, said the deputy head of the Afghan National Army in the province, Ghulam Farooq Parwani. British forces handed over Camp Bastion to the Afghan army in late October as part of a transition that will see the U.S. and Nato combat mission end on December 31. The Taliban claimed responsibility for Friday's attack. Nearly 30 insurgents, including seven suicide bombers, swarmed Camp Bastion (pictured) in  Helmand province . British forces handed over Camp Bastion (pictured) to the Afghan army in late October as part of a transition that will see the U.S. and NATO combat mission end on December 31 . Exit: Some of the last British troops to leave Camp Bastion . In April a report said that blunders by British commanders were 'devastatingly exploited' by the Taliban to carry out an attack on Camp Bastion while Prince Harry was there. Complacency by senior officers meant security was inadequate, allowing heavily-armed insurgents to storm the supposedly impregnable UK base in 2012. The defence select committee was also scathing about the Ministry of Defence, accusing officials of being ‘obstructive and unhelpful’ in the face of the committee’s inquiries to establish what had happened. Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops – eight US and eight British – injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield, setting off explosions which destroyed six Harrier jump jets and three vehicles. Prince Harry was stationed at Bastion to fly Apache attack helicopters. The committee found more than half of the guard towers were regularly unmanned despite at least 20 breaches of the perimeter fence in two years. Prince Harry was based at Camp Bastion in his role as an Apache Helicopter pilot/gunner and was there when the Taliban attacked it in 2012 . Men of 42 Royal Marines Commandos enjoyed good food and an air conditioned dining facility at Camp Bastion . Troops were exposed to ‘unnecessary risk’ because UK commanders, who were responsible for security, had not put in place sufficient safeguards to ensure a Taliban attack was foiled. Following a US investigation into the incident, two generals were ordered to quit. Also in Helmand Friday, two police officers were killed and two wounded in a suicide attack on their vehicle in Nawzad district, local police spokesman Ahmad Obaid said. In eastern Nangahar province, 31 people were wounded when a mosque was bombed during Friday prayers, said Niamatullah Noorzai the chief of volatile Khogyani district. No one claimed responsibility for the attack. The Afghan government's support for a continued international military presence has incensed the insurgents, who are intensifying their war against the administration of President Ashraf Ghani. Immediately after his September inauguration, Ghani signed bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and Nato, and he has made clear his intention bring peace to Afghanistan, which has been at war for the past 30 years. Kabul has seen almost daily attacks in recent weeks, as insurgents turn their attention to foreign targets. On Thursday, a suicide attacker in a car filled with explosives struck a British embassy vehicle on a busy road in the east of the capital, killing a British security guard and an Afghan driver. Late Friday evening, a complex attack, also claimed by the Taliban, was launched against a guesthouse occupied by a U.S. logistics contractor, Aecom Technology Corporation, according to police and security officials.

"Taliban militants are hunting down interpreters who worked with US forces in Afghanistan but while many have been allowed to emigrate to America, those who were sacked or placed on a blacklist claim they have been handed a death sentence. Thousands of Afghan's have been given visas in recognition for their work with the International Security Assistance Force as it was clear they would not be safe in their own homes. But that special dispensation has not been granted for those who were sacked or placed on a blacklist by the US military and those men claim they are being targeted. Even those who have not been blacklisted are not safe. Junid Herean, a 26-year-old interpreter for US Army Special Forces, was kidnapped and captured by Taliban operatives earlier this month. His death made the situation even more frightening for those who remain. Junid Herean was captured and murdered by Taliban operatives earlier this month. The 26-year-old was working as an interpreter for US Army Special Forces . Junid Herean's father Rahman Rahmani had to pick up his son's body after his son was killed by Taliban operatives . Nader who claims he was sacked and blacklisted after refusing to carry out an order to shout at Afghan women said that two men tried to execute him earlier this year, as a result of his work. 'When I realised they were taking me somewhere to be executed I started yelling and fighting,' he told the BBC. 'My brother came out to find me, but by the time he'd come they'd shot me, I just lay down and they left.' He added that if he had not struggled, he would have been shot in the head and not the leg. Another, called Khalid who worked with Special Forces in Helmand province said he was shocked to learn he'd been blacklisted after getting into an argument with a female US civilian. 'I've been shot once, I was taken to a British hospital in Bastion. I've been blown up twice.' he said. 'Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and shout.' Some admit they made rudimentary mistakes like taking a mobile phone on patrol, which could have alerted the Taliban to the soldiers presence. Another said he accidentally left a pair of US serviceman's trousers in his bag - a deadly disguise for a suicide bomber. An Afghan interpreter translates a conversation between an old man and a US Army commanding officer. Interpreters who have been blacklisted say they have been handed a death sentence . A US Army soldier jokes with an Afghan interpreter near Kandahar in Afghanistan. While many interpreters will be allowed to emigrate to the US on special visas, those blacklisted and left behind are targetted by the Taliban . But other say they were blacklisted after failing a polygraph test designed to root out Taliban sympathisers. The interpreters claim this was unreliable. Being placed on the blacklist means an interpreter virtually unemployable, ruled out from work with foreign military forces and companies, along with all branches of the Afghan government, especially the military or police. They are also barred from flying. Yet many now claim they are not even safe in the country's capital Kabul. 'If I get caught anywhere in Kabul right now, they kidnap me, they torture me, they, head off - you know - cut my head off,' said another interpreter Sayid. Alongside other insurgent groups, the Taliban have escalated attacks across the country since the withdrawal of most of the US led forces from the country last month. Targeting, government, security and foreign installations, especially Kabul, members of the public have also been caught in the crossfire. Afghan men surround the scene of a bomb that killed four people. One was an interpreter who worked for the US military . A British security official employed by G4S was among the five people killed this week by a Taliban suicide bomb attack on a British embassy vehicle in the Afghan capital. The explosion left 33 other people injured - many of them civilians who had been going about their business along the busy stretch of road running from Kabul to the city of Jalalabad, which lies 95 miles to the east of the Afghan capital. The attacks have prompted Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani to order a comprehensive review of the country's defense forces. He is also rethinking Afghan policy towards controversial night raids, banned by his predecessor Hamid Karzai. It was also revealed US President Barack Obama signed a 'secret' order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal. Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counter terrorism and training mission for the next two years. But none of this makes Nader or his colleagues feel any safer. 'The only place I was feeling myself was my own home,' he said. 'Now that place has become a combat place for me.' The US State Department said they are 'committed to supporting those who - at great personal risk - have helped us'","The Taliban are targeting Afghan interpreters who worked with US forces .

"Elusive: A 'Himalayan yeti (as imagined by an artist: . It has remained abominably elusive. But the hunt for the yeti is about to take a big footstep forward. A major yeti expedition is being planned after genetic analysis of two Himalayan hair samples showed they come from no known living  creature. Instead, they were an exact match to an extinct species of polar bear. Oxford University researcher Bryan Sykes, a respected human geneticist, says that a creature very similar to it is ‘almost certainly’ still roaming the Himalayas – and TV company Icon Films is so convinced that it is organising an expedition to go and find it. Professor Sykes said: ‘There may well be a yeti.’ In . the first serious scientific study of the abominable snowman for 50 . years, Professor Sykes used a technique used by the FBI to catch . criminals to read the DNA of 30 samples of hair. The . hairs had supposedly been shed by yetis or their bigfoot cousins and . were part of museum and private collections around the world. Twenty . eight of the hairs were genetic matches to known animals from bears to . racoons, horses and cows. But two didn’t fit the mould. Their . DNA matched that recovered from a 40,000-year-old polar bear fossil, . the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reports. One hair was reddish brown and found in a ‘yeti nest’ in a bamboo forest in Bhutan ten years ago. The second was golden brown and taken from a ‘yeti’ Ladakh on the Tibet-India border 40 years ago. The hunter described the creature as very aggressive and noticeably different to the bears with which he was very familiar. Professor Sykes said: ‘They are almost certainly still there and the next step is to find one. ‘They are either really a polar bear of a different sort to the usual polar bears or they are a hybrid with brown bears.’ He . added that the polar bear is the only type of bear to deliberately hunt . humans.  If the yeti is a polar bear relative, this could explain why . it has such a terrifying reputation. Distant cousins?: A genetic analysis of two Himalayan hair samples showed they come from no known living creature, but were an exact match to an extinct species of polar bear . A TV company is now planning a yeti-hunting expedition to the Himalayas. Professor Sykes said: ‘If they find one, they need to get some tissue to do genetic analysis.  They also need to watch how it behaves and that might help explain why people thought they were yetis.’ The biggest yeti hunt was sponsored by the Daily Mail and took place 60 years ago in 1954. The 600-strong expedition failed to snare the mythical beast but did find footprints and hairs. Professor Sykes said: ‘All of that has been lost but no one had the methods then to show what they had, unlike now.’ Professor Norman MacLeod, a fossil expert and evolutionary biologist from the National History Museum, said the DNA technique used in the study could be used to verify other hair samples. He said: ‘Will this ultimately lead to the recognition of new large mammalian species in out-of-the-way corners of the world? ‘No one – certainly no scientist – can know for sure. ‘What we do know is that scientific discoveries just as strange and unexpected…have happened before.’","Analysis of hair samples found to be from extinct polar bear .

"It was the most emotional and heartfelt acceptance speech of the Oscars. Jared Leto, who won the Best Supporting actor award for The Dallas Buyers Club, paid tribute to his mother for encouraging him to believe he could one day become a star. He said she had pushed him to develop his artistic side and always urged him to 'do something special'. Scroll down for video . Hippy: Constance cradles Jared in her lap while Shannon looks at the camera. The boys lived in four different states during their childhood, including a commune in Colorado, and then spent 18 months in Haiti . Oscar tribute: Jared moved the audience in his acceptance speech by paying tribute to his mother (pictured together here with brother Shannon), a 'high school dropout and a . single mom, but somehow she managed to make a better life for herself . and her children' Inseparable: Jared, right, also paid tribute to his 'best friend' older brother Shannon, left. They have stayed extremely close throughout their lives and started a rock band, 30 Seconds to Mars, together . But standing on the stage at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre soaking up the adoration from his peers couldn't be further from his 'dirt poor' start in life. Up until the age of eight, Leto led a transient lifestyle with his 'vagabond,hippy mum' Constance and elder brother Shannon. The boy had been shunted from school to school as the family moved around various states. During one turbulent period the family even lived in a truck before finding temporary place to stay.. The family, living in Bossier City, Louisiana, survived on food stamps and at times were so poor they did not have a television. But that poverty-stricken beginning was also the making of Jared. He has spoken in the past about how they grew up learning to play instruments with a set on bongos ever present around the home. Dressing up and expressing his artistic side was encouraged by Constance, as photos released by Jared on blogs and social media sites have revealed. It wasn't until Constance met Dr Carl Leto in 1979, when Jared turned eight years old, that the youngster would have some stability in his life as the family settled in Virginia. Not only did Dr Leto give a young Jared his surname after adopting him and his brother Shannon, but he has nurtured his talent and encouraged his artistic abilities. Moving: Jared was shunted from school to school as the family moved around various states. During one turbulent period the family even lived in a truck before finding a  temporary place to stay . Captivating: Jared won global acclaim for his portrayal of  HIV infected transgender woman Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club, which led to his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor . Tribute: Dr Carl Leto, who Constance met when Jared was eight, told MailOnline that it was obvious from an early age that Jared was artistically talented . 'It was obvious from an early age that Jared was artistically talented,' Mr Leto said in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'Whether it was music, art or film-making you could see he was very talented. He was just a very intelligent boy and very dynamic. He loved music and would later love film.' Dr Leto, an opthalmist from McLean, Virginia, said he was among the millions worldwide watching on Sunday night as he his stepson received the Academy Award for his portrayal of a HIV infected transgender woman in The Dallas Buyers Club. In Jared's moving acceptance speech he paid tribute to his mother Constance, telling the star-studded audience how she encouraged him to be creative 'work hard and to do something special'. He told how she was a high school dropout who got pregnant with her second son when she was aged 19. He said: 'She was a high school dropout and a single mom, but somehow she managed to make a better life for herself and her children. She encouraged her kids to be creative, to work hard and to do something special. That girl is my mother and she's here tonight. 'And I just want to say, I love you, Mom. Thank you for teaching me to dream.' He also spoke of his close bond with Shannon, who he described as his 'best friend' and has been in a rock band with the actor for years. Jared never knew his father Anthony Bryant, who split from his mother soon after he was born on December 26, 1971. With no means of support, Constance turned to her parents William Lee and Ruby MetroJon for help.. For the first couple of years of his life Jared lived in Bossier City, a town of just over 60,000 residents on the Red River across from Shreveport in Louisiana. The family survived on food stamps with photographs from a blog called 'We are children of the great empire' showing Jared and Shannon's Bohemian upbringing. One photo on the Pinterest site shows Constance, dressed in a floral top and trousers cradling Jared in her arms while Shannon stands by her side. Making of the man: Jared's Bohemian upbringing drove his talent and particularly his musical abilities . Rich experience: Jared has said: 'I had no concept of the word fame; or a notion of success or money. We grew up very poor, so our world wasn't anywhere near that kind of stuff' Split: Jared and Shannon have had limited contact with their three half-siblings over the years . Jared, now aged 42, has been candid about his humble roots.. While on tour with his rock band 30 Seconds to Mars, he said: 'I'm in an arena in Portugal right now, about to play for 19,000 people. That's not supposed to happen for a couple of kids from Louisiana on food stamps.' And talking to the fashion website Mr Porter, he alluded to his hippy upbringing and how fame and fortune seem a distant dream. 'I did grow up in a very creative world,' he told the website. 'It was the 1970s, the age of the artist and the hippy, and my exposure to that shaped me in a really deep way. 'I was raised among people who made things to make them, and with the idea that if you're a creative person, then of course you're going to do something creative with your life - whether you're an artist, a performance artist, a potter or a photographer. 'I had no concept of the word fame; or a notion of success or money. We grew up very poor, so our world wasn't anywhere near that kind of stuff. You have to do what is important to you and protect that.' By the time he reached the age of eight Jared had lived in Louisiana, Wyoming and Virginia. When he was nine years old Carl and Constance had a girl they called Jamie. From Haiti to Hollywood: Jared, pictured with his fellow Oscar winners on Sunday night, spent 18 months in Port-Au-Prince when his mother went there to help out a medical charity . Settled: After Haiti the family settled in Oakton, Virginia where Jared went to Flint Hill school before going on to university . It was at this stage that Carl formally adopted Jared and his brothers and they took his name. While Constance was pregnant with the second of Carl's children, Mateo, they heard Jared's father, Anthony Bryant, had died. Jared and his brother returned to Bossier City for the funeral but Constance did not attend as she wanted nothing more to do with her ex-husband. While in Louisiana for the funeral, Jared and Shannon met Anthony's youngest son, their half-brother, Matthias. While Dr Leto brought some stability to Jared's life it did not last long. In 1981 Carl and Constance were divorced. Dr Leto said he remains estranged from his stepson and has not seen him for a number of years. Jared also has limited contact with his stepbrother and sister. After two relatively stable years in Virginia the family uprooted and moved to Colorado where they lived in a commune for three years. Jared was about to enter high school when Constance decided to move her family to the Republic of Haiti. Shannon revealed in an interview that he had persuade his brother to join them after he had a screaming tantrum. Constance worked for a medical charity and the boys lived in the capital Port Au Prince for 18 months. Jared has fond memories of his time in Haiti and would return in 2011 after the devastating earthquake killed tens of thousands of people. Jared said of his time: 'I was fortunate to live in this magical country when I was a kid. Although it was a relatively short period of time, it had a profound impact on my life'. At the age of 21 he moved to LA to pursue acting. His role as Jordan Catalano on the short-lived but much popular TV series My So-Called Life with Claire Danes helped launch his career and propel him to pin-up status . On his return from Haiti the family settled back in Virginia and Jared joined the Flint Hill School in Oakton, Virginia. At the encouragement of his mom, a talented photographer, he continued to learn the guitar while his brothers Shannon perfected his skills on the drums. The brothers would later form the successful group 30 Seconds to Mars but after leaving high school Jared enrolled at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia to study painting before transferring to the School of Visual Arts in New York. At the age of 21 he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. His role as Jordan Catalano on the short-lived but much popular TV series My So-Called Life with Claire Danes helped launch his career. It also made him a pin-up among teenage girls, and when the series was cancelled he switched to films. Jared's first big screen role was How to Make an American Quilt (1995) and in 1997 he took over a part once destined for Tom Cruise in the film Prefontaine,the story of legendary runner Steve Prefontaine. Leto played a home invader in Panic Room with Jodie Foster in 2002 but later gave up acting to tour with his band. He was tempted back to Hollywood by the part of Rayon, the transsexual who befriends Matthew McConaughey's character. His emotive performance gave him a clean sweep at the awards, winning both the Oscar and Golden Globe.","Jared Leto stole the show with tribute to mother as he won Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for Dallas Buyers Club .

"Friends and neighbours say they’re stunned by the shooting murder of 75-year-old  great grandmother Helen Dawson Key in her Toongabbie home last week, describing her as a ‘well-liked lady' and a respected member of her close-knit community. Mrs Dawson Key's body was found just inside her home in western Sydney, about 10am last Thursday (November 20). Authorities  confirmed she was shot in the head; the bullet  passing through the front screen door before striking her. Mrs Dawson Key had been a long-time member of the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club and was Vice President of the Ladies Bowling Club for the last fourteen years. Friend and lawn bowls partner Mary Gibson said she couldn't understand how this could happen to  'a very, very nice lady.' 'I've only been here 12 months but Helen was a very well-liked lady, played bowls, we still don't know why,' Ms Gibson told Daily Mail Australia.'What I do know is she was a lovely person and I really loved playing bowls with her. Each week we'd have a different partner but I loved playing with her.' Great Grandmother Helen Dawson Key, 75, was shot in the head at the front door of her home in Sydney's western suburbs. Police are baffled by her killing a week after it happened and want public help in tracking down the killer . Mrs Dawson Key's next-door neighbour of 14 years, Zhu Kayw, says she called the police after hearing a shot last Thursday morning. 'We just heard the shot, bang that's it, just one that's all,' she said. 'There was no trouble before that - very quiet, even the dog was not barking,' he said. 'She lived alone, her partner passed away a few years ago. 'We would just meet and say hello when we collect the rubbish bins and bills - we would say ""hello, how are you? She was very friendly, yes.' Another woman who lives just two doors down from Mrs Dawson Key's house in Paris Place said neighbours were in shock. 'Yes it's terribly sad but as residents we're not really speaking about it out of respect for Helen,' she said. 'Not that we know anything really anyway, to offer anything new.' Even the dog was not barking: The ordinarily quite Paris Place in Sydney's Toongabie where Helen Dawson Key was shot through the screen of her front door last week . Police say Mrs Dawson Key, who has lived alone for several years, could have been dead for up to 16 hours before she was found behind her front door. Homicide Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Michael Willing, said police were still trying to determine why Mrs Dawson Key was targeted. 'Mrs Dawson Key had no known links with crime, no known enemies, and by all accounts was a well-liked and highly-regarded member of the local community,' Det Supt Willing said. 'Mrs Dawson Key’s front door was open, but her screen door was shut, so we think she might have answered a knock at the door. 'She had lived at this address for more than 30 years and had strong links with her neighbours and a local bowling club. 'We are, frankly, at a loss as to why someone would want to target her.' 'I loved playing bowls with her': Helen Dawson Keys developed 'many strong friendships' as Vice President of the Toongabbie Ladies Bowling Club for the past 14 years . In a statement today, the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club confirmed Mrs Dawson Key was found by a concerned friend and club member who noted her absence at a recent event. Something 'reflective of the friendships Helen had formed at the club, and the tight knit friendships within the community,' it read. 'Helen Dawson was a valued and respected part of the Toongabbie community having been involved with the clubs Lady Bowlers for some 20 years. She was a committed member volunteering her time to co-ordinate the ladies activities and formed many strong friendships within the club,' the statement read. 'The club's community is shocked and dismayed at the circumstances surrounding Helen’s death and cannot understand how a respected senior citizen and friend could come to harm in her own home.' Helen Dawson Key was found by a friend and member the Toongabbie Bowling Club, where she had been a member for more than 20 years . Det Supt Willing said Strike Force Elermore had been established to investigate Mrs Dawson Key’s death and needed the community’s help. 'We believe Mrs Dawson Key was shot just prior to 6pm the previous day (Wednesday 19 November),' Det Supt Willing added. 'What we’re asking is for anyone who was in the area around the time of Mrs Dawson Key’s death, or has information about her movements that day, to come forward.'

"Taking a stand: Rupert Murdoch tweeted about article which claims carbon dioxide is actually making the planet greener . Rupert Murdoch has taken to Twitter to attack environmentalists claiming that rising levels of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels have been good for the planet. The media mogul based his statements on an article which reported that 30 years of satellite images have shown that the Earth is actually getting greener. Murdoch, a frequent and outspoken critic of renewable energy, tweeted today: 'World growing greener with increased carbon. 'Thirty years of satellite evidence. Forests growing faster and thicker.' He then referenced an article by Matt Ridley in the Wall Street Journal on January 5. Earlier in the day, the tycoon had posted: 'Why not switch from useless renewable energy investments to real job creating infrastructure projects. Many great possibilities waiting.' The WSJ article contends that over 30 years, the world has become a greener place going against the arguments of environmentalists that our planet is at risk from deforestation harming our fragile ecosystem. Ridley writes: 'The inescapable if unfashionable . conclusion is that the human use of fossil fuels has been causing the . greening of the planet...' The conclusion is drawn from data collected since the Eighties by NASA scientist Compton Tucker who tracked global vegetation using satellite sensors. The researcher discovered that forests were getting larger across the world - from the spruces of Canada to the Amazon rainforests. Opinionated: Rupert Murdoch tweeted after 30 years of scientific data showed the planet is getting greener . Outspoken: The Wall Street Journal owner has based his opinion on a piece written by a journalist in his own newspaper . The reason is given that if people burn fossil fuels then there is more carbon dioxide for plants to consume which in turn, makes them grow faster. The Wall Street Journal owner has been vocal on issues from gun control to the Israel-Palestine conflict via his official account. He waded into the debate on U.S. gun control at the end of last year following a spate of shootings including the massacre at Sandy Hook school in Connecticut and two firefighters being killed by a gunman in New York. On Christmas Day he wrote: 'NY Xmas ruined by lunatic shooting 4 firemen, killing two. Shooter killed before, jailed, later released on medical grounds.

"A five-foot alligator has been evicted from a Florida home after police found the reptile living in a children's paddling pool - in a 600 square feet apartment. The alligator, named Snappy by its owner April Rognlin, was kept as a pet along with her three dogs. Mrs Rognlin, who had cared for Snappy in her apartment in Ocean Shores, Grays Harbor County, Washington for almost seven years, was stopped by police following objections from her landlord.

Police in Ocean Shores, some 130 miles from Seattle, said that they seized the reptile following a tip off from the property's owner. They found Snappy in the back seat of Mrs Rognlin's vehicle. The reptile also had its own rockery alongside the paddling pool and lived happily alongside the three dogs. But the terms of Mrs Rognlin's lease did not allow her to keep the 'pet' and ownership of an American Black alligator is also against Washington law, police said.

"Chancellor George Osborne has introduced twice as many tax rises as he has cuts . The Coalition has increased nearly 300 taxes since its formation, a report reveals today. Chancellor George Osborne has introduced more than twice as many tax rises as he has cuts. The Treasury has implemented or pencilled in 299 separate increases since May 2010, but only 119 cuts. And the new taxes will mean that taxpayers will shell out £671billion a year by 2015/16 – a 15 per cent increase on the £513billion in the final year of the Labour government. Research from the centre-right think-tank, the TaxPayers’ Alliance, lays bare the extent of taxes that have been introduced. In all, 254 tax rises have been introduced, with a further 45 pencilled in. To date, 109 tax cuts have been implemented with a further ten planned by the next general election, expected in May 2015. Treasury sources tried to dismiss the research, saying it included the normal up-rating of taxes to bring them in to line with inflation, as well as counting tax-avoidance measures. But Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Families are struggling to bear an increasingly heavy tax burden. ‘High taxes kill jobs, depress wages and increase prices. ‘With nearly 300 tax rises since the Government came to power, it is no wonder everyone is feeling squeezed. The crisis in the public finances came after a decade of tax rises, not tax cuts, but politicians are still coming back for more. ‘Endless tinkering at the edges of the tax system was a vice that George Osborne criticised in the last government, but of which he is equally guilty now he is in office.’ Even subtle changes created complications and could affect investment, Mr Sinclair warned. ‘That creates uncertainty which will undermine economic growth. Britain needs more lasting, strategic tax reform and less fiddling at the margins,’ he said. VAT has been tinkered with 60 times since May 2010. Of these changes, 55 have been rises. Vehicle excise duty has been raised on 36 occasions and cut on just three. There have been ten changes to stamp duty – nine rises and one cut. Income tax has been raised 35 times but cut 24 – including raising the threshold before it is payable to £9,200. The Treasury, pictured, has implemented or pencilled in 299 separate increases since May 2010, but only 119 cuts . Government sources said Mr Osborne had always made clear he would have to introduce some taxes to clear up the economic mess left by the Labour government. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘In 2010 the Government was faced with the challenge of restoring Britain’s worst public finances in peacetime history. ‘We have had to take difficult decisions to deal with the deficit, including to increase some taxes, but we have done this while supporting hard-working people and businesses that create jobs through tax cuts and our programme of tax reform. He added that the Chancellor had increased the tax-free personal allowance by £2,956, cut tax bills of 25 million people and had taken 2.2 million workers out of income tax altogether. Mr Osborne also scrapped a planned fuel duty rise for this month. Corporation tax will go down from 24p to 23p by April and will be cut by a further 2p by 2014.","George Osborne introduced more than twice as many tax rises as cuts .

"At first glance it looks like a scene from a Hollywood horror movie. The tip of the dorsal fin breaking the water, thrashing around as it enjoys a feeding frenzy just a few feet away from a group of swimmers. But in fact these bathers were in no danger at Porthcurno beach in Cornwall because the giant pictured circling them yesterday was a harmless basking shark. These toothless gentle giants are one of three shark species to feed only on plankton, the other two being the whale shark and the megamouth shark . The 16ft fish was pictured filter feeding just yards away from swimmers who were lucky enough to have the chance close encounter. Photographer Rachel Hosken took the pictures saying neither the shark nor the swimmers were in any danger. 'It was a very peaceful scene,' she said. 'The shark just carried on feeding and completely ignored the swimmers.' Basking sharks are normally seen feeding . off the coast of Devon and Cornwall and the west of the UK throughout . the spring and summer. Undeterred by the sheer size of the animal, the brave swimmers try to get a better look . The enormous fish, which have been . protected since 1998, are the largest in British waters and the second . largest in the world, after the whale shark. The evasive fish tend to swim deep in the ocean, but from May to October they come to the surface to feed on plankton blooms. This year, however, sightings in the south west have not been so frequent, according to Ms Hosken. 'I haven't seen many basking sharks this year. For some reason it looks like it may be a quiet year.' Cue Jaws music: It may look like a dangerous scene from a Hollywood thriller, but this giant basking shark is in fact harmless . These toothless gentle giants are one of three shark species to feed only on plankton, the other two being the whale shark and the megamouth shark. This fine specimen, while looking imposing, could in fact grow to twice its current size, to an impressive 33ft long. While they are protected from being fished under the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981, they can often be caught as by-catch particularly in the warmer months when they swim close to the surface. Their slow feeding at the surface also means they tend to get killed by speed boats, jet-skis and other fast boats that don't see them.","A 16ft basking shark was pictured circling swimmers in south Cornwall .

"Youth unemployment has increased in the UK at a faster rate than any country in the G8 since the start of the recession and cannot be blamed solely on the economic downturn, a new report claims. A study by the Work Foundation found that the UK is now only behind Spain and Greece for youth joblessness in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. The problem cannot be attributed just to the recession because other countries have fared better, said the research group. Problems: A study by the Work Foundation found that the UK is now only behind Spain and Greece for youth joblessness in OECD countries. A JobCentre Plus in Cambridge is pictured here last February . The Government was urged to follow the lead of other countries such as Germany and Denmark by taking measures including more apprenticeships and increased training. Lizzie Crowley, the report's author, said: 'In many other developed nations, youth unemployment has remained low despite the global downturn. 'However, in the UK youth unemployment as a proportion of 15 to 24-year-olds has increased at a faster rate over the course of the recession than both the European and OECD averages. 'While the reasons for this are complex, it's clear that the UK can learn from the experiences of those countries that have fared much better in terms of youth unemployment. Going up: This graph shows youth unemployment as a proportion of the population aged from 15 to 24 . 'The Government should focus on those policies that have been shown to work, cherry-picking the best responses from other countries and adapting them to the needs of the UK labour market.' 'The UK can learn from those countries that have fared much better' Lizzie Crowley, report author . Youth unemployment among 15 to 24-year-olds had increased in the UK by 35 per cent to 916,000 between 2008 and 2011. That is compared to an average of 15 per cent in the G8 countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, UK and the U.S. Germany, Russia and Japan had seen a drop in youth unemployment in the same period.","UK now only behind Spain and Greece for youth joblessness in OECD .

"Britons travelling abroad are warned to brace themselves to have less cash in their pockets as the value of the pound tumbled. Sterling crashed to its lowest level for more than a year against the euro and to a five-month low against the US dollar as its ‘abysmal’ start to the year continued. The pound has lost more than 5 per cent of its value against the  single currency since New Year’s Day – putting it on course for its worst month since 2008. Holidaymakers will feel the pinch after the pound fell to 1.16 euros - its lowest level since 2011 . The pound fell to 1.16 euros – its lowest level since 2011 – before clawing back some of its losses. It was trading above 1.23 euros early this month and close to 1.29 euros as recently as July. Tonight it closed at 1.17 euros. The pound has not fallen so sharply in a month since December 2008 in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. William Poole, a strategist at currency broker FC Exchange, said: ‘The pound is truly having an abysmal start to the year.’ Roberto Mialich, a currency strategist at UniCredit, added: ‘Economic reports out of the UK, especially the GDP data, have not looked very encouraging. The pound is likely to remain under pressure.’ Holidays: Britons travelling abroad were told to brace for less cash in their pockets as the value of the pound tumbled . Despite the slump in the pound, the . FTSE 100 above 6300 for the first time in more than four-and-a-half years today as progress by heavyweight stocks helped keep up the New Year rally. The FTSE 100 Index was able to build on its best start to a year in more than two decades, closing up 44.8 points to 6339.2, after strong performances from BP, Centrica and Rio Tinto.

The . FTSE performance will be a welcome boost for Chancellor George Osborne . who yesterday warned Britain 'faces a difficult economic situation' as . he refused to alter his austerity programme, despite warnings it could . be damaging prospects of growth. Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a regional cabinet meeting in Leeds yesterday, designed to show the government has a plan to get the whole economy moving . Mr Osborne told BBC Breakfast: 'We’ve got problems at home, with our unbalanced economy, the problems in our financial services, the debts we’ve build up, and frankly we’ve got problems aboard with many of our export markets deep in recession in Europe. 'We’ve got to confront those problems and we’ve got to do those things in the short term that will help, and we are investing in apprenticeships.' He later addressed a special Cabinet meeting in Leeds when he warned that the growth figures were 'a reminder that the British economy continues to face a difficult economic situation'. David Cameron took ministers to Yorkshire to publicise the announcement of the route for High Speed trains linking Birmingham with Manchester and Leeds. The PM said the line was needed to help Britain compete on the world stage. 'I think it is one of the best answers to healing the North-South divide, to bringing growth to our great northern cities,' he told the BBC. The Chancellor told BBC Breakfast that Britain faces 'a difficult economic situation' but refused to abandon his austerity programme . 'If you look at the big motorways that were put in place, the big railway developments that have been put in place, they have been very effective at driving economic growth by linking up our cities. 'You mention Germany but most countries are getting onboard the high speed rail express. In Japan they did it years ago. France, Spain, others and I think we should be doing it too. 'It’s not just about the journey times between the cities. It’s also the massive extra capacity it releases for other services.' Mr Osborne said HS2 would be an 'engine for growth' in the North as he insisted Britain cannot 'run away from the hard choices it faces' on the economy. The Chancellor rebuffed calls  to change course after latest growth figures show the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2012. Traders broke the FTSE 100 record which has stood since May 2008, despite gloomy economic news in Britain . IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard last week said the Chancellor should 'take stock' in his March Budget and London Mayor Boris Johnson has urged Mr Osborne to 'junk the rhetoric of austerity' to restore confidence in the economy. But Mr Osborne insisted he would not change his deficit-reduction strategy. 'Britain faces a difficult economic situation,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'We have got problems at home, built up by this unbalanced economy, problems in our financial sector and the debts we have built up. And, frankly, we have got problems abroad with many of our export markets deep in recession in Europe. 'We have got to do the things in the short term that will help - and we are investing in apprenticeships, unemployment is falling at the moment. In the end, Britain can't run away from the hard choices it faces. 'We have got to invest in our future, we have got to keep up with other countries who are making all sorts of investments in their economies, and we have got to deal with our debts because, in the end, if people don't believe you are going to pay your way in the world, nothing is going to be invested in.'","Sterling crashes to its lowest level for more than a year against the euro .

"Honda and Subaru are making the safest cars on the road, according to a new report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety - which has spent the last year smashing and mangling countless 2014 vehicle models to see which provide the best protection for drivers and passengers. Out of the IIHS' 22 vehicles that received the Top Safety Pick+ rating - the highest rating the nonprofit can give - five are Hondas and three are Subarus. The Audi A4, the Toyota Prius V, Kia Forte and Nissan Sentra all fared among the worst for this year's models. Scroll down for video . Success: The 2014 Honda Accord made top marks in crash tests performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . New criteria: The IIHS focused its ratings heavily on the 'small frontal overlap crash' in which the vehicle strikes an object with only a small portion of its front end. The Audi A4 did not pass this test . IIHS crashes cars into objects at high speeds from a variety of angles, but this year the nonprofit group is heavily focusing its ratings on the small overlap frontal crash. Russ Raider, a spokesman for the IIHS, said researchers found that particular kind of crash - where the car strikes an object on only half of the front of the car - results in one quarter of all injuries and deaths in vehicles. 'We were looking at how people are still being seriously injured in frontal crashes, despite the fact that vehicles have improved so much in safety performance over the year,' Mr Raider told MailOnline. The group is also focusing on new technology that can either alert drivers to an impending frontal crash or even automatically stop the car.

'The automakers are competing on safety and they want to show that they are earning the top ratings in our evaluations,' Mr Raider said. 'And we want to tell consumers which crash avoidance systems are worth the money and encourage the automakers to make the effective ones more available on their vehicles.' IIHS was even able to influence the largest automaker in the world to change one of its most popular cars.

"A true crime author is suing a paper over a damning review of her book about a woman who killed her husband - after it emerged the man who wrote it was engaged to the killer. Ann Rule launched legal proceedings against the Seattle Weekly after it ran an article accusing her of 'sloppy storytelling' in her book Heart Full of Lies, which is based on the story of Liysa Northon, who was jailed for the manslaughter of her husband. Ms Rule maintained the newspaper printed the review 'unedited', and failed to disclose that its author, Rick Swart, had entered into a relationship with Northon. Defamed: The negative review of Ann Rule's book based on Liysa Northon, who pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of her husband, was penned by a man who is now married to the killer . A complaint filed by the crime author claims 'self-described' journalist Mr Swart pitched the article to the Seattle Weekly about alleged fabrications in the 2003 bestseller Heart Full of Lies, according to a report on Courthouse News Service. In Heart Full of Lies the reader is introduced to handsome airline pilot Chris Northon, his wife, acclaimed surf photographer Liysa, and sons Aukai and Dane. But beneath the 'facade of perfection', Liysa was materialistic and prone to dark moods and controlling behaviour. When Chris was shot dead during a family camping trip in an Oregon forest, his wife maintained she was the victim of domestic abuse and had killed her husband in self-defence. But the page-turner describes how evidence led detectives to question Liysa's story, and the subsequent trial saw her plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter. The piece, said to contain 'numerous false statements concerning the contents of the book', along with 'inflammatory comments', ran on the front page of the paper. It prompted Ms Rule to launch legal proceedings against the newspaper, Mr Swart and Caleb Hannan, then editor of the Weekly. Swart's piece defending Northon failed to mention that he had fallen in love with the 50-year-old former surfing photographer while he was writing it. Swart and Northon are now married, according to the complaint filed in King County. 'The article contained innumerable inaccuracies and untruths concerning the testimony and evidence in the trial of Liysa Northon and also included various unfounded personal attacks on Rule.' The crime author has claimed an editor conducting 'due diligence' would have discovered that Mr Swart was engaged to Northon and questioned his ability to write an objective review. 'Any meaningful inquiry by Seattle Weekly or Hannon should have discovered this significant source of bias,' the complaint states. Ms Rule, who claims she has been 'significantly damaged personally and professionally' by the article, is seeking damages for defamation, invasion of privacy and false light, the report said. The president of Sound Publishing, the owner of Seattle Weekly, said the article was published prior to its ownership of the title. True crime: Liysa Northon, seen left, upon whose story Ann Rule's book, right, was based, served 12 years for the first-degree manslaughter of her husband Chris Northon . Northon was released from jail last year after pleading guilty in 2001 to the first-degree manslaughter of her husband Chris Northon, 44, who was shot in October 2000. Northon maintained she was the victim of domestic abuse and shot her husband in self-defence, but she stood trial and ultimately pleaded guilty to first degree manslaughter.

"Members of his political party competing for federal office have at times gone to extreme lengths to dissociate themselves from him this fall, but President Barack Obama said Monday he isn't taking it personally. 'This isn't about my feelings being hurt,' Obama told Al Sharpton in a radio interview yesterday. 'These are folks who are strong allies and supporters of me, and I tell them, ""you know what, you do what you need to do to win. I will be responsible for making sure that our voters turn out."" ' President Barack Obama casts his early votes at Dr. Martin Luther King Community Center on Monday. Obama said in a radio interview later that day that he's not offended that members of his political party don't want to campaign with him ahead of the midterm elections . The two-term Democratic president let his party's rank and file off the hook pretty easily given that many of them have publicly disavowed him and his polices in the last few months in order get an edge on their Republican opponents in November's midterm elections. Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes cut an ad last month listing off the ways her priorities differ from Obama's, particularly on energy, which is a prime source of income in her coal- rich state. 'I am not Barack Obama,' she said in the commercial as she held a gun and shot skeet. On two occasions since, Grimes has refused to say whether she voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, even though she told a Kentucky newspaper in 2012 that the president had her support. Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn fought back against an ad released by her Republican opponent that features her in a photo with Obama by releasing a video explaining that the meeting with her party's leader took place at a party celebrating former President George H.W. Bush, a Republican. Colorado Sen. Mark Udall ditched his own fundraiser last summer in order to avoid being seen with Obama, who was the guest of honor. Nearly every embattled Senate Democrat who is up for reelection this year has hinted or said outright that it would not be ideal for the president to visit their home states ahead of the election. And none of them have been eager to have the president stump for them. Only lawmakers who are assured reelection such as Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin have been willing to appear with Obama in public. Durbin shared the stage with Obama over the weekend when the president returned to his home state to campaign for the state's incumbent governor, Pat Quinn, and cast his vote. President Barack Obama, center, stands with Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, left, and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, during an early voting and campaign rally at Chicago State University on Sunday. It was the first time this fall that Obama stumped for Democrats . Obama insisted on Monday that he's not offended by other senators' behavior, however, and he told Sharpton that he understands why they don't want to campaign with him. 'We've got a tough map. A lot of the states that are contested this time are states that I didn't win. And so some of the candidates there, it is difficult for them to have me in the state because the Republicans will use that to try to fan Republican turnout,' Obama said. 'The bottom line is, though, these are are all folks who vote with me; they have supported my agenda in Congress, they are on the right side of minimum wage, they are on the right side of fair pay, they are on the right side of rebuilding our infrastructure, they're on the right side of early childhood education,' he added. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest argued today that President Obama could aid Democratic candidates in ways other than by headlining campaign events for them. Candidates running in all states are going to need the support of the president's base if order to win, he told reporters. 'And so helping voters in all these states understand the stakes in the midterm election is one way the president can help Democratic candidates on the ballot,' he noted. The Obama spokesman declined to 'second guess' Democrats who have opted to distance themselves from Obama and defended the candidates and their campaign hands as party loyalists who have a 'strong track record of success.' 'It should be their decision. It's ultimately their campaign. It's their name that's on the ballot,' he explained to the horde of reporters grilling him about his boss' comments to Sharpton. Earnest said it's not necessary for Democrats to fall in line behind the president on every major issue. Sharing a political party 'doesn't mean that they're going to agree on everything,' he said. 'But it does mean that the president wants members of Congress that have their priorities straight,' he said. Earnest had chastised Republicans earlier in the briefing for opposing a minimum wage hike and other economic policies championed by the president and traditionally supported by Democrats. The Obama spokesman said the president is eager to work with both Republicans and Democrats to pass laws that 'grow the middle class.' But 'the fact of the matter is, for reasons that you'd have to ask them about, Republicans have blocked these proposals at every turn,' he claimed.","'These are folks who are strong allies and supporters of me, and I tell them, ""you know what, you do what you need to do to win,"" ' Obama said .

The investigation into the massacre where almost the entire population of the village, including more than 400 women and children, was gunned down or burned alive on June 10, 1944, was re-opened by German prosecutors last year .

The man was named in documents as Werner C, his last name withheld in accordance with German privacy laws. His lawyer, Rainer Pohlen, said his client was at the village but had nothing to do with the massacre. More . than 68 years later, a German prosecutor and senior police officers . visited the abandoned village in central France, which Hitlers troops . burned to the ground before they fled. Last year, German authorities said they believe there may still be six men still at large, . all now in their late 80s, who were members of SS Panzer Division that . committed the atrocity.

Oradour-sur-Glane in a picture taken not long after the troops left and survivors were left to pick up the pieces . Robert Hebras, 87 - was one of only . six villagers who escaped the carnage - said: 'It is a very strange . moment to see German officials here 68 years later' French historian Guy Perlier told Le Figaro newspaper, 'This . illustrates German thinking which insists on shedding light on all acts . committed by the German army during this period' Bodies of the victims lined up following the village massacre in 1944 . Early on the morning of 10 June 1944, the 2nd SS Panzer Division entered the village of Oradour-sur-Glane to avenge the death of a German officer who had been kidnapped by the French Resistance. They marched into the town and separated the men from the women and children. The men were taken to six barns and shed while the women and children were locked in the church while the village was looted. The men were said to be shot in the legs before being doused in petrol and set alight. Six men escaped although one was later found nearby and shot dead. In total 190 men perished. The soldiers proceeded to the church and tried to set it alight. Women and children tried to escape through the doors and windows of the church, but were met with machine-gun fire. A total of 247 women and 205 children died. Two women and one child survived; one was 47-year-old Marguerite Rouffanche. She hauled herself out of a window behind the altar, followed by a young woman and child. German soldiers shot all three of them, killing the woman and child by wounding Rouffanche who escaped into nearby foliage where she stayed until she was rescued the following day. The following is part of her testimony read out to the 1953 Bordeaux military tribunal: . 'Firing burst out in the church then straw, faggots and chairs were thrown pele-mele onto bodies lying on the stone slabs. I had escaped from the killing and was without injury so I made use of a smoke cloud to slip behind the altar. In this part of the church there are three windows. I made for the widest one in the middle and with the help of a stool used to light the candles, I tried to reach it. I don't know how but my strength was multiplied. I heaved myself up to it as best I could and threw myself out of the opening that was offered to me through the already shattered window. I jumped about nine feet down. 'When I looked up I saw I had been followed in my climb by a woman holding out her baby to me. She fell down next to me but the Germans, alerted by the cries of the baby, machine-gunned us. The woman and the mite were killed and I too was injured as I made it to a neighbouring garden and hid among some rows of peas and waited anxiously for someone to come to help me. That wasn't until the following day at 5 p.m.' Although several probes have previously been opened into the massacre, they had to be shut down due to a lack of evidence, and many of the Germans involved in the atrocity, including senior officers, were soon killed in the Battle of Normandy. But . when a historian in 2010 discovered documents implicating all six . suspects, still alive and now aged between 85 and 86, the case had . enough evidence to be re-opened. Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel said that the aim of last year's visit, . the first by German investigators since World War Two was to identify . the exact locations where the SS unit was deployed and interview . witnesses to the massacre. Camille Senon, one of the survivors who witnessed the aftermath of . the massacre in which her family members died, said: ‘It is considered . a positive gesture by the Germans to send investigators for the first . time, 68 years after, even though I would have liked to have seen it . happen sooner’. In September, Joachim Gauck became the first German leader to visit the French 'ghost' village.The highly symbolic visit was as much a part of France's willingness to face up to its wartime past as Germany's. Thousands of French including police and railwaymen participated in the Nazi Holocaust, while collaboration with military units like the SS was also rife. French President Francois Hollande and Mr Gauck were accompanied by two of only three living survivors of the Oradour massacre, including Robert Hebras, 88. Mr Hebras, who was 19 at the time, hid under the corpses of others who were machine-gunned. 'I was consumed by hatred and vengeance for a long time,' said Mr Hebras, adding: 'We must reconcile with the Germans.'

"Owners of curious pets might suspect that their animals have a sixth sense when they seem to be 'spooked' by nothing at all. But now scientists might have gone some way to explaining their strange behaviour as they have said that cats and dogs have ultraviolet vision – so they can see things that humans can’t. However, experts are not sure why the animals need the capability. Cats eyes: Scientists have said that cats and dogs can see in ultraviolet ¿ so they can see things that humans can't - but experts are not sure why the animals need the capability . Scientists are not sure why some animals can see ultraviolet light and others can't. It is thought that some use it to see in the dark as well as spotting potential mates or predators. Reindeer for example see UV light and it helps them spot polar bears that appear to be incredibly well camouflaged in white snow. Bees and other insects use their UV vision to see colours and patterns on plants. Rodents use it to follow trails of urine, but they are not sure what pets use it for. Experts also question why human eyes filter out UV light. Some think it could be to protect the delicate retina, but other animals that live for a long time and see UV do not have damaged eyes. Other scientists consider that the human eye is best suited to seeing detailed images in low levels of light, whereas other creatures that see UV tend to see in less detail. British researchers found that a . whole plethora of mammals, including hedgehogs and ferrets can see in . UV, giving them a better view at night among other benefits. It was previously thought that only a handful of mammals could see ultraviolet light, but the new study could help scientists shed some light on why pets behave the way they do. Ron Douglas, a biologist at City University London, in England told LiveScience: ‘Nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet, but in fact, they do.’ Light is made up of a spectrum of colours and humans can see from red to violet, whereas many animals, such as bees, fish, reptiles and amphibians can see ultraviolet wavelengths invisible to humans. A number of mammals including bats, reindeer and some mice and moles are already known to see in ultraviolet, but scientists are not sure why some animals have it and others, as well as humans, do not. The lens of the human eye blocks ultraviolet light, but in some animals UV can reach the retina and the light is converted into nerve signals, which travel to the brain and are processed. Scientists think that the UV filter in the human eye means that we can see more accurately than without it. Humans can see in such detail because we have dense colour-sensitive cells (cones) in the retina (pictured) that convert light to create detailed images in dim conditions . To explore which animals possess the . capability to see ultraviolet light, the researchers obtained eyes from a . wide array of mammals that had died in zoos, vets, science labs or . slaughterhouses. They measured how much light got through each animal’s eye to the retina. Scientists found that many of the animals, including cats, dogs, hedgehogs, ferrets and okapi, have lenses that let some ultraviolet light though, suggesting that they can see well in the dark. Scientists already know that bees and other insects use their UV vision to see colours and patterns on plants, while rodents use it to follow trails of urine, but they are not sure what pets use it for. ‘The question is only being asked because humans can't see it,’ Dr Douglas said. To explore which animals possess the . capability to see ultraviolet light, the researchers obtained eyes from a . wide array of mammals, including dogs and hedgehogs, that had died in zoos, vets, science labs or . slaughterhouses . He is interested in why the human eye blocks UV light and while some scientists think it could be to protect the retina from damage, many animals that live for long periods of time and are active in the daytime, can see ultraviolet light and ‘their eyes don’t fall apart’. Other scientists think that the UV filter in the human eye means that we can see more accurately than without it. They found that animals that also block this part of the spectrum have the highest resolution vision. Humans can see in such detail because we have dense colour-sensitive cells (cones) in the retina that create detailed images in low levels of light, but nocturnal creatures have eyes that let in as much light a possible, including UV, but do not enjoy the same level of detail. Birds can see UV light, which means that the 'eye' markings in a peacock's tail features looks sharper . Scientists have long been fascinated by the colour vision of animals and what they see when they look at us. A lot of animals, such as birds see ultraviolet so a peacock looking at a potential mate would not see the rainbow of colours like humans, but a plainer, yet vivid display of plumage. Animal colouration provides some of the most striking examples of evolution by natural and sexual selection. But animal colours did not evolve for our benefit; the impressive array of animal colours that we see (and can’t see) in the natural world allows animals to communicate with each other, to attract mates and to avoid predators. Because animal colours evolved for the benefit of animal - and not human - eyes, understanding the visual world from an animal’s point of view can explain why some animals are bright while others are dull. Some are highly patterned and others plain. This allows scientists not only to shed exciting new light on the animal colours we can see, but also to understand the importance of colours that they can’t.","British researchers found that a variety of mammals, including hedgehogs and ferrets can see in ultraviolet - more than previously thought .

"David Beckham has always been in a class of his own in the looks department and now a new survey has proved it... sort of! According to the new research, the majority of men change their hairstyle only three times in their adult lives, with just two per cent saying they change their locks as often as Becks. Nevertheless, while men don't change their hair as often as Beckham, they do want to look like him, with 37 per cent saying that the footballer always has great hair. Hair heroes: David Beckham and Holly Willoughby had the most popular 'dos among those polled . Scary: Beckham had a tough guy mohican at one point . Bottle blonde: Becks' floppy bleached look proved popular . Not a good look: David Beckham's dodgy cornrows . Though men change their hair on average once every six years, almost half of all women go for the chop annually. One in six refresh their style four times a year – virtually every time they go to a salon – and have clocked up more than 50 hairstyles by the age of 35. The results came in a poll of 1,000 men and women carried by the Crown Clinic in Manchester, which specialises in hair transplants. The poll also looked at the reasons why people change their hair, which for men included being bored with the way they look (36 per cent), hair loss (12 per cent) and changing fashion (15 per cent). Just 12 per cent said they changed . their hair because of celebrity influences, unlike women - 45 per cent . of whom said they got a new style in homage to a star. Particularly popular is presenter Holly Willoughby, who, according to researchers, subtly changes her look all the time . and has had 20 different styles since the age . of 18. Always the same: Presenter Jeremy Clarkson and Prime Minister David Cameron never change their 'dos . All better: Embarrassing Bodies star, Dr Christian Jessen, had to seek help to stave off baldness . Extensions: Both Calum Best (left) and Wayne Rooney (right) have resorted to hair transplants . Other reasons included changing fashions (42 per cent), being fed up with bad hair days (32 per cent), needing a change (26 per cent) and going grey (16 per cent) . According to the Crown Clinic's Dr Asim Shahmalak, who has previously performed hair transplants on Embarrassing Bodies star Christian Jessen and model-turned-actor, Calum Best, men are increasingly turning to transplanted follicles to stave off baldness. He said: 'Up to 30 per cent of men start losing their hair by the time they are 30. Thankfully, the days of them combing over their bald patch like Bobby Charlton are well behind us. 'These days men losing their hair often shave their heads to cover up their baldness. However, increasing numbers – inspired by people like Wayne Rooney – are opting for hair transplants. 'Maybe they don’t suit  the shaven-headed look or it doesn’t suit their job. How many lawyers have you seen with a crew cut? 'Many men simply don’t want to have the . same hair style for the rest of their lives and a transplant gives them . lots more options.'","The average man changes his hair three times between 18 and 35 .

"Air crash investigators have been able to download 'valid' information from the flight MH17 black box cockpit voice recorder. The Dutch Safety Board which is leading the investigation into the Malaysia Airlines tragedy said an international team of investigators, working in Hampshire, had conducted a thorough examination of the cockpit voice recorder (VCR) . Scroll down for video . Information: The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the black boxes (pictured) were delivered by Dutch safety authorities to the AAIB's headquarters at Farnborough in Hampshire . Statement: Paul Starbrook (right), spokesman for the Air Accident Investigation Branch (left) tells the assembled media that MH17's flight recorders have arrived safety in Hampshire . In a statement the board said: 'The CVR was damaged but the memory module was intact. 'Furthermore no evidence or indications of manipulation of the CVR was found. 'Following the examination, the CVR data was successfully downloaded and contained valid data from the flight. 'The downloaded data have to be further analysed and investigated.' As the UK investigators poured over the black boxes, bodies from the crash site were arriving in Netherlands where the country's king and queen were taking part in a national day of mourning. King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima were in Eindhoven with relatives of the 298 people - including 10 Britons - killed in the disaster. An unconfirmed number of bodies were released by the rebels yesterday and taken to the Ukrainian government-controlled city of Kharkiv by train. Two military aircraft will fly some of them to Eindhoven this afternoon, where they will be met by the royals, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and relatives. The Netherlands government said a minute's silence will be held before a motorcade takes them to the Korporaal van Oudheusden barracks, where the process of identifying them will begin. Mr Rutte has warned that it could take 'weeks or even months' to identify all the victims. Display: A pro-Russian separatist shows members of the media a black box recorder belonging to flight MH17, before its handover to Malaysian representatives in Donetsk. British experts will now carry out the analysis . The Dutch are leading the investigation into what happened to the Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur flight, at the request of the Ukrainian government. A British team of police officers, led by the Metropolitan Police, will assist with victim identification in the Netherlands once bodies have arrived. The EU has inched towards introducing economic sanctions against Vladimir Putin's Russian 'cronies' in response to the passenger jet's downing by what is believed to have been a surface-to-air missile fired by the separatists that the Kremlin backs. EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels agreed 'concrete proposals' to draw up a list of the Russian president's associates who would be subject to punitive measures, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. The first names will be considered at a meeting where ministers will also look at broader sanctions such as arms embargoes and access to capital and hi-tech goods. Prime Minister David Cameron has openly criticised a ""reluctance"" on the part of some European nations to take stronger action against Moscow, saying it would be ""unthinkable"" in the UK to go ahead with a French deal to sell helicopter carriers to Russia. But MPs have warned that Britain is itself continuing to export tens of millions of pounds worth of arms and other dual-use military equipment to Russia. The Commons Committees on Arms Export Controls said that 251 export licences for the sale to Russia of controlled goods worth at least £132 million remained in force. Coffins with the remains of a victim of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 are carried to a military plane during a ceremony at Kharkiv airport this morning. The bodies are now on their way to the Netherlands for identification . Despite a promise in March by the then foreign secretary William Hague to stop military sales to Russia which could be used against Ukraine, it said that just 31 licences had been revoked or suspended while Russia had been removed as a permitted destination on three others. The Conservatives are also facing calls from Labour to hand back more than £900,000 of donations from what the Opposition said were people with links to the Russian government or 'who may be hit by the sorts of sanctions' sought by the PM. The list includes £160,000 bid in an auction by the wife of a former minister in Mr Putin's government for a game of tennis with Mr Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson. Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: ""The Tories need to come clean about all their Russian links. There can be no impression of conflicts of interest or hypocrisy at such an important time."" A Conservative spokesman said: 'All donations to the Conservative Party are fully and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and published on their website.' Mr Johnson said that checks should be made on the bidder for the tennis match, and appeared to suggest it might not go ahead if her husband - Russian ex-finance minister Vladimir Chernukhin - turned out to be ""an intimate or a crony"" of Mr Putin's. The mayor told Sky News: 'I think you have to do stuff that actually hits Putin and his government where it hurts. 'I know about this tennis match they volunteered me for with some geezer. It is very important full checks are carried out to make sure this is not someone who is an intimate or a crony.'","Hampshire-based Air Accidents Investigation Branch now have black boxes .

"Demonstrators in New York who have been protesting the grand jury decision in Ferguson this week are plotting a revolt against the Thanksgiving Day Parade to 'make people stop and listen' and 'make history'. The hashtag #StopTheParade set social media on fire on Wednesday night, after thousands took over the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn on Tuesday after police officer Darren Wilson escaped charges over the shooting death of Michael Brown. The New York Post is reporting that those protests - in which 10 of an estimated 3,000 were arrested - have inspired a bigger plan to use the spotlight surrounding the parade to push what they say is injustice. A notice posted to Facebook read: 'We do not accept state violence or genocide as cause for celebration. When the masses gather for the Thanksgiving Day Parade, we will gather to remind the public that BLACK LIVES MATTER. 'We will meet on the steps of the Public Library bright and early to plan exact flash mob location and make our signs. Please bring cardboard/posterboard small enough to hide on your person and markers.' Scroll down for video . Drumming up support: This post was circulating Facebook Wednesday night, urging people to join a flash mob that will hit the the 88th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade . Time and place: The group are set to meet at the New York Public Library at 7am to plan the protest, so as not to telegraph their plans online . #StopTheParade: Twitter was alight with people supporting the push against the Thanksgiving Day Parade . Plan: A map of the parade and of a plan of how to disrupt it was being spread on Twitter . 'With this hands-off approach (by police), it gives (protesters) free rein to do anything they want,' a law enforcement source told The Post. 'It’s a free pass to act like a fool.' However a central part of the parade each year is a significant police presence. While Tuesday night's protests were spontaneous, catching police off guard, the same cannot be said for the parade, which brings the city to a halt. 'They’re not going to be able to do at the parade what they did at the Brooklyn Bridge,' the source added to the post. 'What are they going to do, trample kids to stop a float?' The Facebook post that was circulating Wednesday maintained that demonstrators do not want to disrupt the parade. 'We are not interrupting the march, we are making a statement in the crowds,' the post said. 'However, this is a HIGHLY POLICED event. 'NYPD acts as parade security, so be aware, and understand we are not posting all details to the web.' Will the weather get better? New York City experienced rain and snow Wednesday - just one day before the 88th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade . Getting ready: A worker is seen inflating a Papa Smurf balloon on Wednesday . Secret magic: Helium is the stuff that makes Snoopy, Spider-Man, Papa Smurf and other huge balloons sail high above the crowd at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York . A protest is not the only obstacle the parade - now in its 88th year - is going to have to overcome in order to run smoothly today. New York City experienced both rain and snow Wednesday, leaving the city wet and cold for the thousands of spectators set to turn out to watch. Fortunately Thursday is expected to see dry weather with some clouds, the Weather Channel reported. The likes of Papa Smurf, Spider-Man and Spongebob were photographed being inflated by workers on Wednesday. Both onlookers and workers were snapped bundled up near the balloons as rain poured down. Almost showtime: A Spongebob Squarepants balloon is seen in Manhattan on Wednesday. The amount of helium needed for the parade balloons has to be enough to fill 600,000 to 700,000 Mylar party balloons . Inclement weather: Both onlookers and workers were snapped bundled up near the balloons on Wednesday, with rain pouring down . On the scene: Balloon crewman Kevin Jackson gets out Wednesday from under some of the balloons that are part of the 15,000 Macy's balloons for the parade and will transport them to New York . Helping hand: Workers helped out with the balloons despite the bad weather . It'll never rank up there with turkey and pumpkin pie, but for millions of Americans the Thanksgiving experience just wouldn't be the same without.. helium. For 364 days of the year, the colorless and odorless gas works quietly behind the scenes, doing jobs like chilling magnets in MRI imaging machines and helping welders protect their work from impurities. But on Thanksgiving, the lighter-than-air element moves onto a much bigger stage. It's the stuff that makes Snoopy, Spider-Man, Papa Smurf and other huge balloons sail high above the crowd at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. Just so we can be properly thankful for the second most abundant element in the universe (it ranks behind hydrogen), AP turned for some basic facts to Eric Bass. He is product manager for helium at Linde North America Inc. This week, for the 20th straight year, his company will supply the gas to the parade, which in turn is marking its 88th year. Helium forms underground and tends to mingle with natural gas deposits. So when companies extract and process the natural gas, they separate out the helium and sell it to companies like Linde. Helium is shipped worldwide, so the stuff that will pump up Paddington Bear or Pikachu could come from as close as Kansas or Wyoming, or as far away as Qatar, Africa or even Australia. The gas is first chilled for it gets to the parade, so it can be made into a liquid and it's easier to transport. Huge, specialized containers of the stuff are shipped to a plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Gas floats above the liquid in these containers; this gas is drawn off and compressed. The gas is loaded into heavy steel tubes, and 10 to 12 tubes are put on each of four flatbed trucks. The day before the parade, the trucks drive into Manhattan for the inflating of the parade balloons. Crews fill the balloons with long hoses, topping them off on parade day. The amount of helium needed for the parade has to be enough to fill 600,000 to 700,000 Mylar party balloons. But the parade helium is 99.999 percent pure, whereas the stuff in a party balloon might be only 97.5 percent pure. Heroic effort: Spider-Man was seen getting prepared for the parade with puddles on the street next to him . Blasting through: A balloon depicting Thomas the Tank Engine was also being prepared, as workers donned yellow rain gear . The balloons, meanwhile, come in a variety of sizes. According to Macy's, Snoopy is as tall as a three-story building, as long as 11 bicycles and as wide as five taxi cabs. The big balloons are made up of multiple chambers that are inflated individually. After the parade, the helium escapes to the atmosphere as the balloons are deflated.

"When it comes to buying a house in Britain’s cheapest street, one pound is all you need. Desperate to fill and fix up derelict buildings in Stoke, Staffordshire, the local council is trying to attract tenants by giving away property for a nominal fee to turn the fortunes around for the crime-ridden area. As well as a boarded-up building, the owner will receive a £30,000 low interest loan to renovate the property as part of the £3 million scheme funded by Stoke-on-Trent City Council and the government. £1 property: Houses on several streets in Stoke, Staffordshire are being sold for a nominal fee in a bid to clean up the town's crime rates and 'bring life back into the community' The only catch is that the owner must renovate the house and live there five years before it can be sold. The properties for sale, which have two to three bedrooms and a backyard, are in a variety of conditions from liveable to desperately needing refurbishment. Council bosses believe the abandoned buildings are bringing down living standards and raising crime rates by attracting arson attacks, squatters, burglary as well as devaluing and damaging nearby properties. Up for sale: The derelict houses are in varying condition from liveable to in dire need of complete renovation . Streets of emptiness: There a few streets including Bond Street in Stoke which have several abandoned buildings that are part of the project . Abandoned houses are a huge problem in the area with some 4,000 buildings left empty in Stoke as of January 2011, according to council tax data. Source: Stoke-on-Trent Council Tax data January 2011 . The council’s empty house team aims to ‘bring long term empty homes back into use to improve the standard of housing in the city and to bring life back into our communities’ according to the council website. In Staffordshire, Councillor Janine . Bridges, cabinet member for housing, neighbourhoods and community . safety, said: ‘We are looking at ways to bring empty properties back . into use to improve the living standards of homes within Stoke-on-Trent. ‘The idea would mean the council sells . empty properties acquired with Housing Market Renewal Grant for a . nominal fee and provide new home owners with a loan of up to £30,000 to . implement a series of improvement works that the council deems necessary . to bring the property back to a decent home standard.’ Potential: With some love and care, the £1 properties could turn out looking like this lived-in house on the street . £1 could turn into something like this: With renovation work, the kitchen of a £1 property could be fit for a family . The scheme is focusing on Stoke properties in the Portland Street area, Cobridge and the Bond Street area, Tunstall. Lived in and loved: This family happily lives on one of the streets lined with £1 properties . The council's plan is due to be approved later this year and set to launch in 2013. Local resident John Bannister, 72, said: ‘At the moment there is vandalism, people using the back yards of empty houses for fly-tipping and all kinds of problems. ‘There are 18 empty houses just on Bond Street. We want families to come in and stay. Something needs to be done.’ One council tenant, Slovakian immigrant Gabriel Litavec, says the move would help him to get on the property ladder. The 50-year-old factory worker, who arrived in the country in 2005, has been living in a council-owned property in Denbigh Street, for the last three years. The father-of-two and former teacher hopes to buy one of the vacant properties along the street. He said: ‘It is a good chance to get on the property ladder and own my own house. ‘If .

"Britain has been accused of airbrushing the role of Anzac troops out of this year's First World War commemorations in favour of soldiers from developing nations. Reports in Australia claim no 100-year anniversary events have been planned by Britain that specifically recognise the sacrifice made by Australia and New Zealand. Instead, it has been suggested Whitehall officials in London have been briefed to push the efforts by the so-called 'New Commonwealth' nations. The Prince of Wales (who later became the Duke of Windsor) and Earl Haig watching an Anzac march pass Australia house in London in 1919 . A total of 20,761 British, Australian and Indian soldiers were killed at Anzac Cove in April 1915 . This is despite 62,000 Australians and 18,000 New Zealanders who died in the Great War fighting for the British Empire. Another 156,000 from Australia were wounded and 41,000 from New Zealand. According to News.com.au, British government sources have confirmed internal briefings on commemorations have not mentioned Australia or New Zealand once. It is claimed the civil service has been told to concentrate on other British Empire contributions by soldiers from countries such as Nigeria and other dominions in West Africa, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Reports say the push is to promote 'community cohesion' and link younger generations of ethnic Britons today to the war fought by their forefathers. It is also seen as high-level support for old colonies like India which is experiencing a booming economy. A government insider told News.com.au: 'It's basically to remind Britons the First World War wasn't just soldiers from here fighting in France and Belgium but involved people from Lagos, Kingston and the Punjab,' a government insider said. Troops going ashore at the Dardanelles. The soldiers are seen leaving S.S. Nile for the landing beach in 1915 . 'There has been no mention of old Commonwealth Allies like Australia or New Zealand but more interest in celebrating the role from New Commonwealth countries. I think it's fair to say Commonwealth ties are being frayed a little on this one.' The British Department For Culture, Media and Sport, tasked with First World War anniversary events, confirmed there were no plans to have any specific events recognising Australia's contribution to the British Empire's cause. 'I don't think there is anything specific at this stage for individual countries,' a spokeswoman said. 'It is obviously a four-year program so there may well be specific things as we go along but nothing specific at this stage.' Anzac troops (Australia and New Zealand) marching in London during the First World War . British author and commentator Murray Rowlands said it was a disgrace Australian and New Zealanders were being ignored. He told News.com.au: 'There is nothing in (British Prime Minister) David Cameron's program of commemoration that mentions these countries,' he said. 'The British pretty much lost the war in July 1918, they were in retreat and it was the Australians and New Zealanders who got put into the gap… they were the ones that held up the Germans in places like Hamel (Somme, northern France), with the Americans too but basically the well-trained Australians, pretty battle hardened by then, who stopped the Germans. 'If they had got to Amiens the game would have been gone because that was where the British communication system were. That needs recognition.' Australia's Department of Veterans Affairs and the Australian High Commission in London are planning a series of Australian-specific events in the UK this year and next year, the 100th anniversary of Gallipoli. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzac) fought alongside their British, French and other allies at Gallipoli in Turkey during World War One. The background to the Gallipoli landings was one of deadlock on the Western Front in 1915, when the British hoped to capture Constantinople. The Russians were under threat from the Turks in the Caucasus and needed help, so the British decided to bombard and try to capture Gallipoli. Located on the western coast of the Dardanelles, the British hoped by eventually getting to Constantinople that they would link up with the Russians. The intention of this was to then knock Turkey out of the war. A naval attack began on February 19 but it was called off after three battleships were sunk. Then by the time of another landing on April 25, the Turks had been given time to prepare better fortifications and increased their armies sixfold. Australian and New Zealand troops won a bridgehead at Anzac Cove as the British aimed to land at five points in Cape Helles - but only managed three. The British still required reinforcements in these areas and the Turkish were able to bring extra troops onto the peninsula to better defend themselves. A standstill continued through the summer in hot and filthy conditions, and the campaign was eventually ended by the War Council in winter 1915. The invasion had been intended to knock Turkey out of the war, but in the end it only gave the Russians some breathing space from the Turks. Turkey lost around 300,000 men and the Allies had 214,000 killed - more than 8,000 of whom were Australian soldiers, in a disastrous campaign. Anzac Cove became a focus for Australian pride after forces were stuck there in squalid conditions for eight months, defending the area from the Turks. The Anzac soldiers who arrived on the narrow strip of beach were faced with a difficult environment of steep cliffs and ridges - and almost daily shelling. At the height of the fighting during the landings of April 25, 1915, the waters around the peninsula were stained red with blood at one point 50 metres out. Fierce resistance from the under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster for the campaign. Among those who suffered the greatest losses were the Anzacs Australian and New Zealand Army Corps who made the first landings, swept by an unexpected current to a narrow cove rather than the wide beaches the planners intended. War historian Charles Bean wrote: ‘That strongly marked and definite entity, the Anzac tradition, had, from the first morning, been partly created here’. But despite the toll in human life, the campaign is seen as a landmark in the formation of national consciousness in the two countries. The 25th of April was officially named Anzac Day in 1916.","Reports in Australia claim no anniversary events planned for Anzacs .

"Beverly Hills in one of the the richest zip codes in America, but the overall poverty rate in California is now the highest in the country, new U.S. Census Bureau figures show. The Golden State’s poverty rate is a whopping 23.5 percent – higher than the District of Columbia, at 23.2 percent, and even Florida, and 19.5 percent. California’s shockingly high number came after the Census Bureau changed how it measures its data. Visible difference: California has pockets of poverty like Compton in South Los Angeles, just moments away from the wealth and privilege of Rodeo Drive in the opulent enclave of Beverly Hills . Fantasy land: California isn't the stuff of dreams for the millions who live there in poverty . For years statisticians have based poverty rate calculations on the cost of food – but over the years this methodology has drawn increasing criticism. The Census Bureau wasn’t getting an accurate picture of poverty rates because it didn’t take into account tax rates and assistance programs such as food stamps, child care expenses and medical costs, according to the Huffington Post. The most recent figures released last week include such data – what the Census Bureau calls ‘supplemental poverty measure.’ The new metrics have shot California’s poverty rate sky high. Helpless: a San Francisco bag lady lives in a park . Believer: Los Angeles homeless man looks for work . Urban sprawl: California's high cost of living is one of the causes behind its shockingly high poverty rate . In recent years the state came in at about 16.3 percent. ‘We're seeing a very slow recovery [nationally], with increases in poverty among workers due to more new jobs which are low-wage,’ University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Timothy Smeeding told the Associated Press. ‘As a whole, the safety net is holding many people up, while California is struggling more because it's relatively harder there to qualify for food stamps and other benefits.’ California’s jump between the supplemental and conventional measures was the largest swing of any state, and the Sacramento Bee attributes it to the state’s high cost of living. ‘There are several important differences between the official and supplemental poverty measures,’ Census Bureau economist Kathleen Short said in a statement. Poorest in nation: New U.S. Census Bureau data show that California's poverty rate is 23.5 percent . ‘For instance, the supplemental measure uses new poverty thresholds that represent a dollar amount spent on a basic set of goods adjusted to reflect geographic differences in housing costs. The official poverty thresholds are the same no matter where you live.’ Under the supplemental measures, the national poverty rate jumped by a full point up to 16.1 percent, or just under 50 million individuals. The poverty rate for minors dropped from 22.3 percent down to 18.1 percent, while the rate for seniors (ages 65 and above) nearly doubled to 15.1 percent.","New California rate is 23.5 percent -- up from 16.3 percent .

"It remained a hidden underwater world for nearly 25 years, but slowly the water around Argentina's 'town that drowned' has started to recede, exposing the ruins that nestle below.

"Nuclear submarines are renowned for their enormous size and range of capabilities including operating for extended periods underwater. But now a company has unveiled a diesel electric submarine that can rival these bigger counterparts in size and ability. Called the SMX-Ocean, it is so advanced that it can stay submerged for three weeks and could cross the Atlantic six times without surfacing. Scroll down for video . French defence company DCNS Group has unveiled the SMX-Ocean (illustration shown). Their concept for a new submarine aims to replace nuclear vessels. They say this sub is just as big and even more capable. It can stay submerged for three weeks and has 34 weapons on board . The advanced submarine was built by French naval defence company the DCNS Group. It is 330ft (100 metres long), 50.9ft (15.5 metres) high and 28.9ft (8.8 metres) across. On board it has a total of 34 weapons including torpedos, mines, anti-ship missiles, cruise missiles and anti-air missiles. This means it can attack targets across four areas: underwater, surface, land and air. Length: 330ft (100 metres) Height: 50.9ft (15.5 metres) Beam: 28.9ft (8.8 metres) Surface displacement: 4,750 tons . Maximum diving depth: 1,150ft (350 metres) Maximum speed, submerged: 20 knots . Range: 18,000 miles (29,000km) But it represents a breakthrough in submarine technology, as previously nothing had been able to compete with nuclear vessels. In order to be as capable as nuclear submarines it uses something known as Air Independent Propulsion (AIP). This technology allows a non-nuclear submarine to operate without needing access to atmospheric oxygen for long periods of time. This enables it to remain underwater . They basically work by using a diesel engine operated conventionally on the surface but, underwater, they are supplied with an oxidant (such as liquid oxygen) that keeps them running. The SMX-Ocean also uses a quieter form of propulsion that makes it less noisy. There's no word yet on when such a submarine might enter service though. Its array of weapons means it could attack targets across four areas: underwater, surface, land and air (pictured is an animation of a missile hitting the ground) One of the benefits of using AIP over nuclear propulsion is that nuclear submarines must constantly pump coolant, which can be noisy. AIP submarines can be almost entirely silent and are therefore much more stealthy. According to Tyler Rogoway for Fox Trot Alpha, the SMX-Ocean is intended to eliminate the remaining advantages of nuclear submarines. It uses the latest AIP technologies in its larger hull design, namely the latest in fuel cell and lithium-ion batteries. This allows the boat to stay submerged for 21 days and remain out at sea for 90 days without coming in to port. This gives it the option of performing ‘blue water’ (open ocean) operations as opposed to just ‘brown water’ (on the coast). Amazingly the submarine even has unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) it can deploy and go out of its range of operation. 'The SMX-Ocean is most likely a vision of things to come in regards to subsurface warfare technology,' Mr Rogoway wrote. 'As nuclear submarine technology becomes increasingly unaffordable for even the most wealthy states, their capabilities will have to be shared by cheaper diesel-electric AIP boats.'","French defence company DCNS Group has unveiled the SMX-Ocean .

"In a sickening lecture to the crew of lawyers and victim's family members who were in the Guantanamo Bay court, the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks said the U.S. government had killed many more people in the name of national security than he is accused of killing. Khalid Sheik Mohammed addressed the court on Wednesday during a pretrial hearing where he placed blame on the American government rather than accepting any ounce of guilt following his role in the terrorist attacks that killed 2,976 people. 'When the government feels sad for the death or the killing of 3,000 people who were killed on September 11, we also should feel sorry that the American government that was represented by (the chief prosecutor) and others have killed thousands of people, millions,' said Mohammed, who wore a military-style camouflage vest to the courtroom. His lawyers said previously that Mohammed considers himself a prisoner of war and wanted to wear clothing similar to what he wore as a mujahedeen fighter. Scroll down for video . Court camouflage: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was seen wearing a military-style camouflage vest during a court appearance on Wednesday after the judge ruled that he was allowed to do so . American-made: The vest, which is made by American company Rothco, is not used as any official military uniform but is frequently found at Army Navy stores across the country . The judge in his terrorism trial ruled . Tuesday he could wear camouflage. The prison commander had previously . forbidden it, but that was overturned by the judge, sparking outrage . from victims families who saw the move as a way for him to send a message to fellow extremists. He accused the United States of using . an elastic definition of national security, comparable to the way . dictators bend the law to justify their acts. 'Many can kill people under the name . of national security, and to torture people under the name of national . security, and to detain children under the name of national security, . underage children,' he said in Arabic through an English interpreter. 'The president can take someone and . throw him into the sea under the name of national security and so he can . also legislate the assassinations under the name of national security . for the American citizens,' he said in an apparent reference to the U.S. killing and burial at sea of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the . U.S. use of drone strikes against U.S. citizens accused of conspiring . with al Qaeda. He advised the court against 'getting . affected by the crocodile tears' and said, 'Your blood is not made out . of gold and ours is made out of water. We are all human beings.' On trial: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed boycotted the pretrial hearings and the judge ruled that the defendants can wear camouflage gear if they want to during the formal trial . Mastermind: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has previously claimed responsibility for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that resulted in thousands of deaths . The judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, . gave Mohammed permission to speak and did not interrupt him, but said he . would not hear any further personal comments from the defendants. Mohammed's lecture to the court came . during a week of pretrial hearings at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base . in Cuba for him and four other captives accused of recruiting, funding . and training the hijackers. Under the Geneva Conventions, one of . the things that separate soldiers from unlawful belligerents is the . wearing of uniforms that distinguish them from civilians. Soldiers must . also follow a clear command structure, carry arms openly and adhere to . the laws of war. Mohammed's defense attorney, Army . Captain Jason Wright had argued that forbidding Mohammed from wearing . military-style garb could undermine his presumption of innocence in the . war crimes tribunal. ‘They are trying to use their . situation to rally jihadists around the world and that puts American . troops in danger,’ said Debra Burlingame, the sister of one of the . pilots who died on September 11. ‘If these defendants were members of . the Klu Klux Klan and they were on trial for killing a black family, for . burning their house, would they be allowed to wear their Klan uniforms . in court to show their solidarity with their fellow Klan members? Absolutely not!' she told MailOnline. Hurt: Debra Burlingame, the sister of one of the pilots whose plane was hijacked in the 9/11 attacks, calls the leniency on the dress code issue a way for the terror suspects to promote their cause . Mohammed and one other defendant attended the pretrial motions hearing for the military tribunal. Three defendants chose to stay in . their cells. The five are charged with planning and aiding the worst . terrorist attack on U.S. soil. The vest worn by Mohammed is one popular among hunters, but also has a seasonal appeal to many right now as company spokesman John Ottaviano told MailOnline that it is particularly popular as a part of military-inspired Halloween costumes. With many camouflage patterns differing from type to type, the style that the 9/11 mastermind sported is thought to be the company's vintage camouflage range. Mr Ottaviano was quick to point out that the 'vintage' label applies to the type of aesthetic wash that was used in its making, and not an implication that it was ever previously used as part of an American military uniform. The suggested list price for such a vest, which uses a camouflage style called 'woodland', is $52.49. Rothco, established in New York City in 1953, has previously held military contracts, but they do not hold any currently. 'We certainly aren't happy that he's . chosen to wear our clothing into the court room much the same way Brooks . Brothers would not be happy if a murderer wore their suit into court,'Mr  Ottaviano said. The only stipulation that the judge, . Army Col. James Pohl, made regarding the dress code for the five . defendants is that the camouflage that they wear must not be U.S. military uniforms. That said, The New York Post reports . that the camouflage hunting vest used by Mohammed and his fellow . detainee was made by Rothco, an American company that produces hunting . and military gear. A . spokesman for Rothco, the military and survivalist clothing supplier, . confirmed that they were not aware that their vest was going to be the . one that helped Mohammed make his symbolic statement in court on . Wednesday. 'We certainly aren't happy that he's . chosen to wear our clothing into the court room much the same way Brooks . Brothers would not be happy if a murderer wore their suit into court,' said John Ottaviano, director of the company's sales and marketing . divisions. The selection of a Rothco vest was in . keeping with the judge's specification that the camouflage worn by the . defendent not be a part of any U.S. military uniform, as the company . does not have any current contracts with the armed forces and does not . supply any of their standard-issue uniforms. That said, the vest is a common item, as Mr Ottaviano told MailOnline that it could be found in any Army Navy store. Mohammed's lawyer made a formal . request to the judge asking to allow the camouflage because that is what . Mohammed wore when he was part of the mujahedeen militia that fought to . overthrow the Soviets. ‘These men are guilty of war crimes- you have to strip them of all those things that promotes their murderous cause,’ Mrs Burlingame said. Poor conditions: The detainees' defence lawyers . say the environment in the office assigned to them at Guantanamo . (pictured) is making them ill . Court: Monday's hearing was more peaceful than previous proceedings have been . 'I'm sympathetic because he’s under a . microscope and he wants the proceedings  to be fair and to be perceived . as fair and legitimate,’ explained Ms Burlingame, who is a former . attorney,  ‘but he doesn’t have to take it when defence council and the . defendants go over the line.’ ‘It is the judge’s job to insure a . fair trial for the defendants and prevent them from making propagandist . statements from inside an American military courtroom. ‘They are speaking to Islamists . members of al Qaeda and those who would be ripe for recruitment for . their cause. They want to portray themselves as soldiers of Allah.’ Mohammed and his four co-defendants . face charges that include terrorism, conspiracy and 2,976 counts of . murder in violation of the law of war, one count for each known victim . of the September 11 attacks at the time the charges were filed. They . could get the death penalty if convicted.

Jones said: 'It was so silent in there and everyone was just taking pictures I figured I had to say something to make people laugh.' President Obama told Cooper what she might tell her family and friends about the day she met the President: 'I can’t believe Mike, he is such a fool. 'But fortunately, the president was nice about it, so it’s alright,' he added. Outside the poling station Cooper told WLS-TV that she received a hug and a kiss from the President: 'On the cheek, just the cheek — please, Michelle, don’t come after me — just the cheek!' They said they had no idea before turning up that President Obama would be there. He was voting early himself to encourage a higher turnout among the electorate. The couple have been interviewed on multiple broadcasts since the jokey exchange including on CNN and on CBS Chicago. President Barack Obama cast his vote early for the 2014 midterm elections in a bid to get voters to go to the polls  ahead of election day. The president voted in a community center in Chicago - named after the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., - near his family's home on Chicago's South Side. 'The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen,' the president told reporters at the Center, as he took advantage of the first day of early voting in Illinois. 'I’m so glad I can early vote. It’s so exciting. I love voting,' the president said, in a not-so-subtle way. Adding: 'Everybody in Illinois [should] vote early. It’s a wonderful opportunity.' Before he was handed his ballot, a poll worker asked if he was Barack Obama, according to Politico. 'That’s me,' he said. Jealous now? Obama taunted his heckler back by giving his delighted girlfriend a kiss on the cheek . Hot water! Aia Cooper rolled her eyes outside the polling booth after her boyfriend Mike Jones teased the president - before adding to Michelle that she and Barack only shared a peck . President Barack Obama is handed his ballot as he arrives to vote early for the 2014 midterm elections . Overnight stardom: The couple were interviewed following the jokey exchange with the President . However, his gesture was widely seen as being symbolic as he explained that the most 'important job in a democracy is the job of citizen.' Obama also delivered doughnuts and pastries to Democratic campaign volunteers in Chicago to boost moral on Monday. He carried  the boxes of pastries into a Pat Quinn campaign office as Governor Pat Quinn and Senator Dick Durbin stood alongside him. 'The way we win any election is making sure we turn out,' he told the room full of volunteers. And on Sunday night, the president did not shy away from saying exactly who he was likely to cast his vote for at a rally for Illinois Governor Pat Quinn. The governor is running for re-election in Obama's home state. A fired up Obama told a crowd at Chicago State University, that he would vote early for Quinn and Sen. Dick Durbin. 'The first thing I'm gonna do tomorrow is cast my vote to re-elect Dick Durbin and give my friend Pat Quinn four more years as governor of the great state of Illinois,' Obama said. The president attended a campaign rally for  Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, left, and Senator Dick Durbin, right . Obama described Durbin as a mentor who took him under his wing when he first became a senator in 2005. He said: 'Durbin helped make sure that I didn't get into too much trouble.' However, another stop made by the president on the campaign trail Sunday was marred by a steady stream of crowd members leaving early and even a yelling heckler. The president was at the Democratic rally in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, near Washington, to support Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, who is running for governor. But as Obama's approval levels drop to record lows, many candidates from his party have been reluctant to appear with the president during their election races because of his waning popularity. Many Democrats have been wary of appearing with the president during their election races . Obama and other Democrats have been urging their supporters to vote early this year instead of waiting until Election Day. His party is hoping to turn out Democratic-leaning voters, including minorities and young people, who frequently skip voting in midterm years. In 2012, Democrats proved that they could use early voting as a tactic against the Republicans to give them a head start. The strong turnout for early voting is widely seen as one of the things which helped Obama beat Mitt Romney in battleground states like Iowa. At least 33 states will offer early voting this year, which has led both parties to encourage voters to take to the polls early. Republicans have even decided to invest in early voting in states where there are tight Senate contests this year.","President Obama arrived in Chicago to vote in 2014's midterm elections .

"The Texas Department of Criminal Justice says polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs is no longer hospitalized and has been returned to prison in East Texas. Agency spokesman Robert Hurst confirmed Thursday that Jeffs has been discharged from Hospital Galveston, a TDCJ facility southeast of Houston. Hurst declined to provide the reason for Jeffs' hospitalization, citing medical privacy laws. Behind bars again: This isn't the first time Jeffs has been hospitalized in prison. He was put in a medically induced coma after going on a hunger strike in August 2011 (pictured then on the left, and a healthier Jeffs in August 2006 on the right) Jeffs was admitted March 11 and discharged Monday. He returned to the Powledge unit in Palestine to continue serving a life sentence. Attorney Roger Hoole was one of the last people to speak with Jeffs before he was hospitalized this month. Hoole traveled to Texas to collect a deposition from Jeffs, who was subpoenaed to testify in Utah court regarding a custody case with one of the men he excommunicated from his church. Dynasty: Warren Jeffs pictured with his father Rulon Jeffs, his predecessor as prophet of the FLDS church. Rulno died in 2002 .

'He looks at the ground when you ask him questions about his conduct,' Hoole told Fox 13. The 58-year-old Jeffs is the ecclesiastical head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He was convicted in 2011 of sexually assaulting two of his child brides, ages 12 and 15.

"Shocking claims of abuse within a secret NSW-based religious group have come to light after former members revealed the years of torment they endured at the hands their 'cult leader'. Self-styled guru Pastor Scott Williams allegedly used his warped brand of evangelical Pentecostalism to run a secret homosexual sex ring while misusing huge amounts of member donations for his own personal use. In harrowing and chilling detail, a young woman has recounted the experience of being born into and growing up in a twisted religious cult, as part of an in depth investigation by ABC's Four Corners. Emily Wassmann's involvement in the Christian Assemblies International (CAI) was predetermined before her birth, as her parents were both members of the 'church', and she described her childhood as a series of terrifying, confusing and lonely circumstances. Scroll down for video . Emily Wassmann relived the horrific experience of growing up in cult religious group Christian Assemblies International in a revealing interview with ABC'S Four Corners on Monday evening . 'The teaching was that a child was born evil and that that had to be beaten out of them with a rod of iron,' she told the program. Denied a life outside the church, at 14 Ms Wassaman told her parents she wanted to leave the group. She stayed living in their house but said they did not speak to her. Shortly after, at just 15, she was sent away to Canada to live with another church member. Here the young woman battled with her mental health and came close to attempting suicide on a number of occasions. Unlike some, Ms Wassmann and her parents escaped the Assembly, but said other young people who were born into the cult and left all experienced similar hardship. 'Every. Single. One.' When she was just 15, Ms Wassmann, pictured with her father, was sent away to live with church members in Canada after she told her parents she wanted to leave the group . Also revealed on the program was the slave-like status women in the church were afforded, and the verbal and physical abuse they suffered at the hands of the men in the CAI. Every aspect of their lives were monitored, from what they wore to how they raised their children. But the most shocking account was from a man named Gunther Frantz whose former wife was beaten by other men. In front of a group of men, stripped down to her underwear Mr Frantz's former wife was beaten with a wooden stick while her husband wasn't present - apparently for her lack of obedience. She was pregnant at the time, but her husband was unaware of this. When asked how he felt when he discovered his wife had been physically assaulted in his absence, Mr Frantz simply said: 'Makes you sick to your guts, doesn't it?' Gunther Frantz was one of Pastor Scott Williams' closest confidantes in the cult, and revealed his former wife had been beaten by other men in the church . Also aired in the shocking report, dozens of former members said bizarre sexual rituals were carried out in secret by Mr Williams, who had been given authorisation by God to sidestep biblical commands against homosexuality and train his male member to be sexually obedient. The abuse detailed by the men and women, who until now have remained silent out of fear and shame, ranged from spiritual, financial, verbal and physical abuse to sexual abuse of adult male members. 'I haven't come across anything like it,' Four Corners reporter Caro Meldrum-Hanna told Daily Mail Australia ahead of the episode going to air on Monday night. 'Former members describe it as a cult.' Pastor Scott Williams allegedly used his warped brand of evangelical Pentecostalism to run a secret homosexual sex ring while misusing huge amounts of member donations for his own personal use . Meldrum-Hanna, who came across the story back in 2010, spoke to dozens of former members in Australia and across the world and she said all of their claims made against Mr Williams were similar. 'Initially it appeared almost unbelievable because it was so extreme. But it happened,' she said. 'In the first six months you are treated like royalty but after that the screws turn. In order for Scott Williams to trust you, you had to give more of yourself, particularly for men.' Former members say they were recruited to the church as teenagers and young adults and they were brainwashed into believing Mr Williams was 'The Anointed One'. Former members say they were recruited to the church as teenagers and young adults and they were brainwashed into believing Mr Williams was 'The Anointed One' 'These people are so normal. Many weren't religious but they say they were preyed upon. So you can get an idea of how they were controlled,' Meldrum-Hanna said. Mr Williams left Australia 38 years ago to convert hundreds of young people to his religious group throughout Europe. The headquarters of CAI are now in Coffs Harbour in northern NSW. Meldrum-Hanna said the revelations weren't just based on the testimony of former members, but documents and financial records from CAI. 'There was enormous pressure placed on members to donate to this organisation. We're talking 10 percent of their gross income plus many more offerings throughout the year,' she said. The various former members interviewed by Four Corners left Mr Williams' group over a number of years but said there was a 'mass exodus' in 2006. The abuse detailed by the men and women, who until now have remained silent out of fear and shame, will be aired as part of a four-year ABC investigation . The headquarters of Christian Assemblies International group is now in Coffs Harbour in northern NSW . 'The ones who allege they were abused by Scott Williams... were concerned about others, like their own sons, so they came together to blow the whistle internally within the church,' Meldrum-Hanna said. Police carried out a four-year investigation of the CAI group and the results of that investigation will be revealed by Four Corners when it airs on Monday night. The program approached Mr Williams and senior people in the church about the claims, but all requests for interviews were denied. Mr Williams, now 70, lives with his wife Ree in a beachfront apartment in Coffs Harbour. It is one of the many properties he purchased with church donations.","Former members of NSW-based religious group have detailed claims of sexual abuse at the hands of leader Pastor Scott Williams .

"Health chiefs have warned that an NHS black hole means patients may have to start paying for services - days after Norman Lamb (pictured) said the health service must spend its budget more wisely . A multi billion-pound black hole in NHS finances means that patients will have to get used to either being charged for treatment or paying increased taxes, health chiefs have warned. In a stark analysis of the dangers facing the Health Service, the leaders of medical royal colleges and patients groups said it was ‘creaking at the seams’ and cannot carry on as it is. The funding crisis is so dire that, in future, trusts may have to consider charging for GP appointments and asking patients to contribute towards the cost of drugs. The warning comes just days after a health minister admitted that by the end of the decade, the NHS will face a funding gap of £30billion a year – with ‘dire’ consequences for patients. The Mail revealed on Saturday that Norman Lamb had told an audience of Liberal Democrats last month that ‘absolutely vital services’ will have to be cut if the Health Service does not spend its £100billion-a-year budget more efficiently. Shortages are already beginning to affect the NHS, with some patients being denied cancer drugs and longer waiting lists for A&E and cancer treatment. The Health Service also needs 3,000 more midwives. Yet despite this, the NHS has found tens of millions to spend on cosmetic surgery such as facelifts, nose jobs, liposuction and breast augmentation. Every week there are now 164 taxpayer-funded nose jobs, 37 liposuction procedures, 22 facelifts and 273 breast enlargements being carried out on the cash-strapped Health Service. In a letter to the Times, health experts concurred with Mr Lamb on the scale of the black hole. Senior figures including Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, and Dr Maureen Baker, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, warned that by 2020 the NHS will require an additional £30billion to maintain the current level of service provision. ‘The status quo is not an option,’ they wrote. ‘We are already seeing the signs of the system creaking at the seams. ‘All financial options are difficult politically; higher tax spend, co-payments or changes to what is available.’ Patients have been warned that they face paying for drugs or GPs' appointments if the funding gap cannot be closed . The nine signatories called for more to be done to improve the efficiency of the NHS and address the ‘budget crisis’ affecting it as people enjoy longer life expectancies. ‘More must be done by us all to eliminate inefficiencies and wasteful variation in care, and apply technology to transform care delivery,’ the letter said. ‘Resources and vigorous service reform must go hand-in-hand. Business as usual won’t do.’ They call for an ‘honest, open dialogue’ on the issue, adding that unpopular moves – such as hospital closures – may need to be considered. ‘We need a new settlement; a fundamental, holistic agreement with the country on what health and social care should be, how and where it is delivered to maximise the quality of care, and how it should be paid for,’ the letter said. ‘We believe the route is an all-party-mandated, independently conducted “national conversation” on the scope, provision and funding of health and social care.’ The letter was also signed by Sir John Oldham of the Independent Commission on Whole Person Care, Jeremy Hughes of the Alzheimer’s Society, Dr Jean-Pierre Van Besouw of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, Chris Hopson of the Foundation Trust Network, Ciaran Devane of Macmillan Cancer Support, Lord Adebowale of Turning Point. Mr Devane and Lord Adebowale are both non-executive directors of NHS England, which is responsible for most of the health budget. Sir John said: ‘It would require productivity gains greater than what was achieved during the Industrial Revolution to bridge the gap, and the NHS has never been close to that.’ A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ‘The NHS will remain free at the point of use. ‘We are already dealing with the challenge of a growing, ageing population by moving to a system geared towards prevention rather than just treatment by improving community care to keep people living healthier at home for longer.’","Health chiefs warn that NHS needs reform to continue operating .

"The most iconic piano in Hollywood history – the one played by Sam in the Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman classic Casablanca – is set to go under the hammer this month. The famous upright – used in Rick’s Cafe in the 1942 film – is expected to fetch $1million – about £630,000 – as one of the highlights of a film memorabilia auction at Bonhams in New York. The salmon-coloured instrument, one of two featured in the film, is the one on which the movie’s signature tune, As Time Goes By, is played by Sam (singer Dooley Wilson). In tune: Humphrey Bogart and co-star Dooley Wilson at the piano in a scene from 1942 film Casablanca . It is one of 30 items from the Second World War drama being put up for sale by a private collector. The doors of Rick's Cafe America, a final draft of the screenplay, signed cast photos, and passports created for the characters in the film will all go up for auction. The sale will also have items from other films including a pinafore and a test dress originally designed for Judy Garland for her performance in the film 'The Wizard of Oz.' 'Bonham’s is thrilled to represent this remarkable Casablanca collection, certainly one of the most significant film memorabilia collections still in private hands,' said the director of Entertainment Memorabilia at Bonham’s, Catherine Williamson, earlier this year. Iconic: The salmon-coloured instrument, one of two featured in the film, is the one on which the movie’s signature tune, As Time Goes By, is played by Sam (singer Dooley Wilson) Classic: Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca. The upright piano is one of 30 items from the Second World War drama being put up for sale by a private collector . A different 58-key upright piano from a flashback scene between Bergman and Bogart was auctioned at Sotheby's in 2012 and sold for $602,500, below the estimated $800,000-$1.2 million that Sotheby's predicted. Casablanca took home three Oscars in 1943 for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Director. In the scene that the piano is played, Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, storms over angrily having instructed Sam, played by Wilson, to never play that song again and is stunned to see his ex-lover Ilsa, played by Ingrid Bergman, at the bar with her husband, a fugitive leader of the Czech resistance.","The famous upright is used in Rick's Cafe in the iconic 1942 film .

"When it comes to complaining about public transport, Twitter users don't hold back. The US and Canada's top agencies earn more ire on the social media site than airlines and stir up as much disdain as police departments. Many services have also more anger directed at them in 140 characters than did the Internal Revenue Service. William Shatner represented the most positive Twitter luminary and, on the negative end of the scale was Osama bin Laden. The most negative Tweets among the 10 major US public transport agencies studied were for the Washington, D.C. Metro and public transport systems in Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago . This is according to a study by the University of Southern California which algorithms to analyse 64,000 comments on Twitter about public transport agencies, as well as police departments, parks and airlines. Surprisingly, the same algorithm found that William Shatner was more popular than Kim Kardashian on Twitter. Kardashian and Shatner were used alongside villains as controls on the most positive and negative ends of comments. The former Star Trek star  represented the most positive Twitter luminary and, on the negative end of the scale was the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The most negative Twitter commentary among the 10 major public US transport agencies studied was directed at the Washington, D.C. Metro and public transport systems in Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. A lack of Twitter interaction from the DC Metro saw the rise of the parody Twitter account Unsuck DC Metro, which currently has nearly 29,000 followers . Earning slightly less negative commentary on Twitter — and just ahead of the IRS - were Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. Vancouver's Translink system fared the best, followed by Portland's TriMet and Toronto's TTC systems, which all had more positive Twitter sentiment on average than the other transport agencies. Lisa Schweitzer, author of the study, said public transport has an especially acute Internet trolling problem. The most negative Twitter commentary among the 10 major public transit agencies studied was directed at the Washington, D.C. Metro; Boston (MBTA); Philadelphia (SEPTA) and Chicago (CTA) public transit systems. Earning slightly less negative commentary on Twitter (and just ahead of the Internal Revenue Service) were Los Angeles (MTA), New York (MTA) and San Francisco (BART). Vancouver’s Translink system fared the best, followed by Portland’s TriMet and Toronto’s TTC systems, which all had more positive Twitter sentiment on average than the other transit agencies. 'Negative and racist comments about transport patrons are a larger part of the negative comments about transport, much more so than parks, airlines or other services,' Professor Schweitzer said. 'Otherwise, commenters appear on balance to say equally happy and unhappy things about public transit and airline service.' Agencies that use Twitter to respond to users' complaints or answer questions get more positive Twitter reaction and more civil discourse online, Professor Schweitzer said. 'It's about the marketing potential of social media — a lot of public transit agencies are simply tweeting their problems to the world by blasting out late service announcements,' she said. 'That's not a good use of Twitter. 'Agencies don't want to stifle criticism or squash people's concerns because those are valid. 'At the same time, you don't want people walking away from social media thinking transit service is terrible, either, just because people complain.' The most positively regarded agency of those studied, Vancouver's Translink system, tweets 90 times a day to interact with its patrons. On the other hand, a lack of Twitter interaction from the DC Metro saw the rise of the parody Twitter account Unsuck DC Metro, which currently has nearly 29,000 followers.

"A storied piece of American history is being kept away from the public as the federal government tries to cut costs during the sequester. The retired Air Force One airplane that is now holed up in a private hanger in Ohio is the same one where Jackie Kennedy stood as Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in, as her husband's blood was still fresh on her jacket. It is the same airplane that ferried then-President Nixon to China in his famed trip done to help smoothe tensions with the Eastern power. Historic moment: Lyndon Johnson was sworn into his presidency on board the now-retired Air Force One, with President Kennedy's wife Jacqueline standing alongside him on November 22, 1963 . Foreign relations: It was also the plane that President Nixon took on his landmark visit to China in 1972 . On hold: The former Air Force One, now known as SAM 26000 (pictured) is normally on display to the public at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Ohio but it has been closed because of the sequester . And though then-Vice President Al Gore was the last one to take a significant trip on it when he marked the airplane's retirement in 1998, it had been still pleasing visitors for years as a display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force for years. That is until it was closed off to visitors, as CNN reports that the shuttle buses used to drive tourists to the remote hanger were seen as an excessive cost for the federally-funded enterprise. As a result, aviation aficionados will have to settle for the plethora of photos from the plane's- which is now referred to as Special Air Mission 26000, or SAM for short- it's most dramatic- and infamous- moments. The first came with the death of a President, as SAM 26000 was the plane that ferried then-President Kennedy to Dallas, Texas along with his wife on that fateful November day in 1963. Unexpected moment: Federal Judge Sarah Hughes (left corner) was called on board, making her the first female justice to swear in an American President following President Kennedy's assassination . Precious cargo: Jacqueline Kennedy escorts her husband's casket off the plane when they landed at Andrews Air Force Base, and his brother Bobby is seen at her side . Widow's walk: The President's blood could still be seen on her legs and suit when they landed . As a result of the assassination, it also became the plane that ferried his body back to Washington. Before that happened, though, it earned another distinction as it became the spot where the only female judge has sworn in a president. Federal Judge Sarah Hughes was called on board to give Johnson the oath of office before heading back to the Capitol with a heartbroken First Lady and presidential corpse on board. On hold: The former Air Force One, now known as SAM 26000 (pictured) is normally on display to the public at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Ohio but it has been closed because of the sequester . The plane didn't finish it's funereal tasks there, as it later was used to fly the coffins of LBJ and Nixon to their final resting places, Texas and California respectively. Nixon's most memorable moment with the plane came during his lifetime, however, as he made his 1972 trip to the People's Republic of China. It was the first time that an American president visited the country, and was seen as a significant step in building diplomatic relations. Plane diplomacy: Nicon's trip to China (seen here leaving alongside his wife, then-First Lady Pat) in 1972 was the first time an American President visited the Eastern country . Touring the East: The visit came as a surprise by many, but had positive effects on the countries' relationship . On a different trip, the plane played a role- albeit a very minor one- in one of the most embarassing moments in American politics. Booby prize: After Monica Lewinsky was transferred from The White House because she was 'too close' to President Clinton, she worked at the Pentagon and went on a government trip to Europe . After becoming an intern and mistress of then-President Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky was transferred out of the White House and into the staff roster for the Pentagon. While she was upset that she was further away from her married lover, one perk that helped soften the blow was the fact that she was included on a Pentagon trip to Europe. As such, she rode the plane overseas, since it was used for the trip since it was getting older and relegated to second-tier activities (as opposed to being on call for the president's use). The plane's final flight came just two years later when then-Vice President Al Gore was on board for the last leg of a multi-decade tour of duty when it went from Washington to Columbia, South Carolina. 'If history itself had wings, it probably would be this very aircraft,' Gore said during the trip. Now it is a part of history being hidden away, however, as it is off limits to visitors who make the trek to Dayton, Ohio to visit the aviation history museum. Because the sequestration is still in flux, there is no telling exactly when it will be reopened to the public.","The retired Air Force One, now called Special Air Mission 26000, is normally on display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Ohio .

"Google search will soon do more than simply hunt down words - instead, it will 'answer questions' in a drastic makeover for the search engine. Within months, Google searches will no longer throw up a simple list of blue links - a huge change for the page that forms the world's 'doorway' to the web. Instead, the top of the Results page will be dotted with information that 'answers questions' posed in Search. The move echoes what Microsoft has done with its Bing search engine. Google: Search, the company's most enduring and popular product, could be in for a radical makeover - which will make the search engine more like Microsoft's second-placed Bing . Bing is the second most-popular search engine in the U.S. - and built to deliver answers to questions. 'People today expect more than 10 blue links on a page,' says Microsoft. Google has quietly amassed information on 200 million of 'entities' - people, places, products - and the new version of search will feed users information about the 'entity' they are searching for. Instead of relying on Wikipedia, for instance, to provide facts and figures, Google will provide this information itself. In 2010, Google acquired FreeBase, a 'knowledge graph' company - and has expanded its database of 'entities' from 12 million to 200 million today. Unnamed sources speaking to the Wall Street Journal said that the change - a dramatic shift for Google - would start to appear over the next few months. Amit Singhal, a senior vice president at the company said in a recent interview that most searches rely on other sites to provide an answer - not Google itself. 'We cross our fingers and hope there's a Web page out there with the answer,' says Singhal. The move, answering questions within one search rather than requiring users to 'click through' to other sites, will be highly useful for users of smartphones such as Google's own Android . Singhal claims that the changes are part of an ongoing process which could take years. The Wall Street Journal claims that the process will be much more rapid. The new version of search will use what's called 'semantic search', which attempts to understand the meaning of searches, rather than simply hunting for words. Google still accounts for roughly 66 per cent of the search market worldwide. But the new, beefed-up version of search could keep the giant ahead of competitors such as Microsoft's Bing, and enable the search engine to compete with Facebook, if the social network ever unveils its own search engine.","'Semantic search' answers questions in search box .

"An American couple charged with starving their 8-year-old adopted daughter to death in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar were sentenced Thursday to three years in prison, a verdict that stunned and shocked the family, according to the couple's defense lawyer. Matthew and Grace Huang were jailed in Qatar on murder charges in January 2013, following the death of their daughter, Gloria. They were released from prison last November, but banned from leaving Qatar during the trial. 'We feel that we have been kidnapped by . the Qatari judicial system,' Matthew told reporters outside the . courthouse after the sentencing. 'This is wrong.' The Huangs will appeal the decision and it is unclear whether they will be imprisoned pending appeal. Scroll down for video . Prison: Matthew, left, and Grace Huang, are seen speaking to the press Thursday after they were sentenced to three years in prison in Qatar . Matthew added: 'We . just don't believe that we have been convicted. This verdict . should be overturned immediately and we should be allowed to go home.' The . Huangs' lawyer, Sami Abu Sheikha, said the judge hastily read out the . sentence and failed to say what the couple was guilty of. Matthew . Huang had been working in the booming Gulf nation as part of . infrastructure improvements for Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup. The Huangs say their adopted daughter, . who was born in Ghana, died of medical problems complicated by unusual . eating habits that included periods of binging and self-starvation. Defense witnesses have testified that the girl appeared healthy and . active just days before her January 2013 death. The prosecution had demanded the death . penalty, alleging that the couple had denied food to Gloria and said she . was locked in her room at night. Family: The parents are shown here with their three adopted children before Gloria's death . A . Qatari doctor who conducted Gloria's autopsy found that the child's . hips, ribs and spine protruded and concluded the cause of death was . dehydration and wasting disease. On Wednesday, the State Department . expressed concern that not all of the evidence had been weighed by the . court. It also said it had raised the case with Qatari officials on . multiple occasions. During Thursday's sentencing in Doha, . Judge Abdullah El-Emedy also ordered the Huangs deported from Qatar . after serving the three-year sentence and issued them a fine of 15,000 . Qatari riyals, which is about $4,100. The case raised questions about . possible cultural misunderstandings in a conservative Muslim country . where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively . rare. The couple are suing Matthew's employer for not warning them that their adoptions would not be well thought of in Qatar. Trial: Matthew, left, and Grace Huang, a U.S. couple who were accused of murdering their nine-year-old adopted daughter Gloria, stand outside the entrance of the Court of First Instance after their trial . Happy: The family says Gloria, shown left, was severely malnourished in early childhood and would periodically refuse food for several days and then binge eat or get food from bizarre sources, such as garbage cans or from strangers - a behavior her parents traced to her impoverished upbringing and were trying to address . An investigative report by Qatari police had raised questions about why the Huangs would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits' and raised concerns that the children were part of a human trafficking operation or were 'bought' for organ harvesting, according to the family's website. The Huangs, of Asian descent, have two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the U.S. Matthew Huang described the allegations . as 'ridiculous' and called on President Barack Obama to explain to the . ruler of Qatar 'why American families adopt high-need children.'

When Gloria died, she was in an anorexic episode and had not eaten in as many as four days, Ophoven wrote in her report last year.

"Throughout his time at Swansea, Brendan Rodgers would frequently reference his years under Jose Mourinho and compare them to a ‘Harvard education’. It probably doesn’t bode well for the apprentice-turned-rival that Mourinho has made a habit of schooling Liverpool in league fixtures as well. Nine Premier League meetings and seven wins. Only one defeat. It is a match Mourinho simply loves; an occasion that has often drawn his sharpest comments and biggest wins. It is also a fixture, when set away from league competition, that has brought some of his biggest lows. Brendan Rodgers (left) and Jose Mourinho face up again at Anfield on Saturday afternoon . Mourinho tries to keep the ball from Steven Gerrard as last season's clash at Anfield hots up . Liverpool threw away the Premier League title against the Blues in this fixture last season . Mourinho beats his chest at Anfield last season and (right) some unheeded advice from a young Liverpool fan . Two Champions League semi-final defeats in his first spell at Chelsea and one monumental, enduring tantrum about the Luis Garcia ghost goal of 2005. Those nights ensured his relationship with Rafa Benitez is perhaps as stormy, if not worse, than the one he shares with Arsene Wenger. They are fixtures that have helped Mourinho’s legacy in England, both through results and deeds. It is a fixture that has already left a stamp on Rodgers which might yet be crucial to the story of his career. That April day last season when Steven Gerrard slipped and Demba Ba sauntered through ranks as one of the most dramatic in recent Premier League history. Liverpool were heading towards the most improbable of titles; Gerrard the most spectacular of twilight glories; Rodgers the garlands that come from transforming a team (albeit with the incredible benefit contribution of Luis Suarez). But the Liverpool captain slipped. Rodgers lost twice against Mourinho in that campaign – his first two games in the opposite dugout to the man who once mentored him in his roles as academy and reserve-team coach at Chelsea. In an interview with Sportsmail while he was at Swansea, Rodgers said: ‘Jose was simply a wonderful influence on my career. He couldn’t do enough to help a hungry young coach. Captain Gerrard slipped to allow Chelsea's Demba Ba to run through and score the opening goal . The result meant skipper Gerrard still hasn't won a Premier League title while at Liverpool . Mourinho 'consoles' Gerrard after the 2005 League Cup final, which Chelsea won . Played 18 Won 9 Drawn 4 Lost 5 . *Record in all competitions . ‘He was always interested to hear my opinions and to share his. As a young coach, you are forever indebted to people like that, who become such an influence on you.’ By then, Rodgers was speaking with the perspective of a man who had suffered bad, chastening times in management. When he finally left Chelsea after four years in 2008, he took his first management job at Watford. He did reasonably well, but upset supporters by leaving after seven months to join Reading, where he had coached prior to working at Stamford Bridge. He lasted six months before getting sacked at Reading and entering the wilderness. ‘I found it very hard to get work,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I spent days writing my thoughts down in notepads, not a laptop, trying to learn from the experience. I like to think in ink. ‘But it was a hard time.’ He went on to Swansea and the rest is history. But it is also that background that will give him a measure of perspective when handling the pressure of this fixture against Chelsea and Mourinho at Anfield. The questioning of his judgement has never been greater than this week, having drawn enormous criticism for his team selection against Real Madrid. Willian taps home the second goal in front of Chelsea's travelling supporters at Anfield . Liverpool were not hammered, but by stacking his cards in favour of domestic matters against Chelsea, Rodgers cannot afford a bad defeat. If he wins, he will claim a measure of vindication for not setting his best side in a marquee fixture in Spain. If he loses, he will doubtless be pilloried. To think, a ‘ghost goal’ could determine whether he is seen as genius or fool. Mourinho, as one so well versed, knows the fine margins. Those Champions League defeats against Liverpool came via a disputed Luis Garcia goal and a penalty shootout. To his mind, they are a large reason he has two Champions League wins rather than four. Perhaps that goes some distance to his explaining his relationship with the club from Anfield. He caused controversy in February 2005 when a Gerrard own goal pulled Chelsea level in the Carling Cup final. Mourinho held his finger to his lips, an apparent taunt towards the Liverpool fans though later explained as a message to the press. Whatever the motive, Mourinho was sent off as Chelsea won 3-2. Rodgers (right) looks up to Jose Mourinho after coaching under him while at Stamford Bridge . But Mourinho has a tumultuous relationship with a few in football- here keeping the ball from Gerrard . Mourinho’s career is littered with such clashes of personality. With Rodgers, the relationship has remained good and affectionate, even if there have been barbs since the dynamic changed and they became rivals. Last season, after Gerrard’s slip, Rodgers accused Chelsea of 'parking two buses' and said it was 'not difficult' to coach a team to defend. It was unsporting from a decent man and Mourinho wasn’t impressed. The Portuguese took a minor swipe this week at Rodgers’ selection to face Madrid. Reflecting on April's win, Mourinho said: 'It gave the title to Man City, simple as that. Liverpool, with a point in that match, would have been champions. Without it, they lost the title. It meant nothing to us. After our defeat against Sunderland, that match meant professional pride. We were not in the race.’ And on the rivalry goes. On such sub-plots, the Premier League has always thrived. With Chelsea on an unbeaten season and Rodgers facing significant questions, the table is set for another big meeting.

"Ahead of Saturday's mouth-watering clash between Liverpool and Chelsea, Sportsmail spoke to Stamford Chidge and David Tyrer of live4liverpool to better understand the intense rivalry between the two sets of supporters . Has your opinion of Liverpool/Chelsea changed since the match last April – and what was watching that match like? Stamford Chidge: Not really! To be fair they played very well last season albeit with the advantage of only playing once a week and with Luis Suarez, who is clearly one of the best strikers in the world. But we all felt that they wouldn’t be able to continue that form and their challenge for the title this year. Steven Gerrard slips on the ball as Demba Ba bounces during Chelsea's 2-0 win at Liverpool in April . Gerrard looks on after seeing Ba score to put Chelsea 1-0 up at Anfield . Jose Mourinho holds onto the ball as Gerrard rushes to restart the game with Liverpool losing at Anfield . Obviously it was pretty tense as all the big matches are, but there were moments of pure hilarity seldom experienced at a football match, such as Steven Gerrard’s slip for Demba Ba’s goal; Liverpool’s increasing desperation with frequent 30 yard shots; Fernando Torres passing to Willian for the second goal and Jose Mourinho’s subsequent celebration with the Chelsea supporters after it, and the knowledge that we had well and truly ruined Liverpool’s party! David Tyrer: Not at all. I respect they did what they needed to get a result but that's all. It was one of the most painful games to watch - you could literally feel the title slip away over 90 minutes. What is it about Liverpool/Chelsea you dislike so much? SC: How long have you got? Their sense of entitlement rankles most – just because they were a great side for 10 years in the 70s and 80s their belief that they deserve respect and have a divine right to win. Liverpool fans wave flags and banners during the 2-0 defeat to Liverpool . The obvious media love in around Liverpool lauding the so called ‘greatest supporters in the world’ and their constant wallowing in ‘history’ compounded by their constant jibes at us for having ‘no’ history and being all ‘plastics’. All clubs have history and all clubs have a proportion of ‘plastic’ fans. They’re arguments are farcical. DT: I liked Chelsea in the late 90s but they were really the first of the 'new money' clubs and everything about the club just feels 'false'. They're also very privileged and those plastic flags, well.. The less said . Are these the fans you can't stand more than anyone else in the league? SC: That’s actually more difficult than it sounds – it very much depends on how old you are and where you grew up – some Chelsea supporters will always say Spurs are the fans they can’t stand most and some might say Man Utd; others go back to the rivalry with Leeds, whilst new supporters might say Arsenal or even Man City. I was a teenager when Liverpool were winning everything so that has always grated, but there is no doubt the bitterness has been accentuated by the frequent big games we had with them during Mourinho’s first stint, and the issues around Rafa Benitez – that and their clear enmity towards us in recent years. I can remember a time when they weren’t bothered with us, probably as we posed no threat then. Rafa Benitez managed Liverpool for six years (left) before an interim spell at Chelsea . Liverpool fans display a banner playing tribute to Rafa Benitez after his return to Liverpool with Chelsea . DT: To be honest, it's a toss up between them and United for me. Everton fans can be insufferable after derbies but a lot of friends and family are Blues and it's usually more harmless but those two sets of fans are known for being a little nasty. How many Liverpool players would get in your side? SC: None – well maybe one or two in the Chelsea women’s team (laughs) How many Chelsea players would get in your side? DT: Maybe more than I'd like to admit, at present. Petr Cech or Thibaut Courtois in an instant, and I've also been a long-time admirer of Branislav Ivanovic. Nemanja Matic could be the difference in any midfield battle, while Cesc Fabregas has matured into one of the best midfielders around. So I'd take 3-4 - but not Costa. I think he's very handy but I don't think he'd suit our style. Like Mario Balotelli, he'd slow things down too much. Watched him do that for Spain at the World Cup! Cesc Fabregas has been in stunning form for Chelsea since signing from Barcelona in the summer . Diego Costa has scored nine goals in eight Premier League games for Chelsea . Will Liverpool win the Premier League under Brendan Rodgers? SC: No – Suarez and last season was his chance. He has a lot to learn in terms of navigating a season on four fronts (especially in managing a European campaign and challenge for the Premier League). The fact that he has perhaps spent the Suarez cash unwisely and failed to address Liverpool’s defensive issues hint at an arrogance and tactical naivety that could be his fatal flaw. DT: I'm torn but I'd like to think Rodgers has a bit more about him than he's given credit for so, yes. He may be a bit egotistical but look at where an ego has got Mourinho. You don't get anywhere at the top end of the game without one any more. Will Chelsea win the Premier League this year under Mourinho? Mourinho directs his players during training on Friday as they prepare to take on Liverpool . Rodgers shows off his shooting skills during training at Melwood on Thursday . SC: There is a way to go yet but I’m feeling pretty confident. Mouinho clearly wants it and so far we have been the best team in the league. Manuel Pellegrini looks to losing the plot at City, Louis van Gaal has a lot to do to repair the inherent damage at United, Arsenal and Arsenal Wenger still haven’t learned their lessons and are flat-track bullies at best, and Liverpool are a shadow of last year without Suarez. I am confident we will be champions but I don’t like counting my chickens!! DT: At the moment, who has the players or (in City's case) the form to stop them? I think they're definitely favourites but all it takes is one or two injuries, suspensions and they're in the same boat as everybody else. They've got the squad to cope but I think there'll be one or two twists and they might be run away with it the way people are expecting.","Liverpool take on league leaders Chelsea at Anfield on Saturday .

That summer he had fractured his shoulder . while diving into the hotel swimming pool. According to Michael Cody, at the University of South Carolina's Fitzgerald's website, he had also fired a revolver in a suicide threat. It was after this incident that the hotel where he was staying in Asheville, the Grove Park Inn, refused to let him continue living there unless he had a nurse to look after him. Mr Cody states: 'He was attended thereafter by Dorothy Richardson, whose chief duties were to provide him company and try to keep him from drinking too much. 'In typical Fitzgerald fashion, he developed a friendship with Miss Richardson and attempted to educate her by providing her with a reading list.' According to website Open Culture, which published the list, at the top of the page, Richardson had written: 'These are books that Scott thought should be required reading.'

"Scroll down for video . A pamphlet detailing the beatings, threats and intimidation endured by a Yorkshire housewife more than 300 years ago has been uncovered by academics at the University of Huddersfield. In the work, which dates from 1684, a woman named Mary Hampson lists the catalogue of abuse she suffered at the hands of her overbearing and violent husband. Although Mrs Hampson eventually escaped her abusive spouse, she first endured being beaten and starved and a violent incident involving a gun - all of which is detailed in in A Plain and Compendious Relation of the Case of Mrs Mary Hampson. Tragic: The 1684 pamphlet documents the violence Mary Hampson endured at the hands of her husband . Work: Dr Jessica Malay, who found the pamphlet, has now turned the tale into a book . Now her harrowing story has been turned into a book, The Case of Mistress Mary Hampson, by academic Dr Jessica Malay. 'Men were allowed to correct their wives but were not allowed to be permanently damaging,' explains Dr Malay. 'For instance, they could withhold delicacies from their wives but should not starve them. Gentry households would have been separated from their neighbours and there would have been less opportunity for people to see and hear the abuse. 'If a wife was a runaway she would have no rights to anything. Often she would be legally forced to go back to the house she had left. 'At that time the community would try to intervene if they thought there was a risk of long term damage to the woman and in a lot of cases servants would intervene.' Mrs Hampson's story began in 1656 when she married solicitor Robert Hampson aged 17 under pressure from her family. Her husband's behaviour swiftly deteriorated, with Mary suffering a litany of abuse that included frequent beatings, occasionally in front of Mr Hampson's friends. 'This [some financial dealings] I was speaking to him of, which he was very angry at, and said I reproached him, and did strike me upon the brest [sic] which grew very bad,' writes Mrs Hampson in the pamphlet. Terrifying: The ducking seat was often employed to punish 'common scolds' during the 17th century . 'He went out of town, and left me in a sad and weak condition with very little money.' Later she adds: 'The next morning [Robert] came to my bed-side, and told me if I would not arise and be gone I should starve there. 'For he had given strict order to my maid, his clark [sic] and laundress, not to let me have anything to eat. And all that day I could get nothing to eat. 'He came to me at twelve a clock [sic], and seeing my maid had brought me some broth to drink, did threaten her. 'About eleven a clock at night I went into his study to speak with him, hoping his fury was abated. He drew a pistol out of his pocket and set it to my throat saying, that if I would not be gone out of his lodgings he would kill me.' Chastisement: Men were allowed to punish their wives, here with a Derbyshire Brank, during Mary's lifetime . Horrific: A period illustration detailing the fate of women inside the Fleet Prison in 1691 . Mary then tells of being beaten by her husband in front of other men. She writes: 'So soon as they were in the chamber, Mr. Hampson shut the door, and said that I came to molest him, and did strike me upon the head to the ground; then threw me against a glass-door. 'Feeling myself hurt in the arm with the glass (although much ashamed) I cryed [sic] out. The two men Edwards and Robinson stood as applauders of Mr. Hampson. 'When I cryed out Mr. Hampson opened his inward chamber door, and there was his cleark [sic] and another man, ready at Mr. Hampson's order to drag me into the street. 'And at the Temple Gate, the cleark said I was mad, and that they had order to bring me to Bedlam.' After plucking up the courage to leave her abusive husband, Mrs Hampson spent much of her time in Europe, visiting England occasionally in a bid to claim alimony. When, in desperation, she published her pamphlet, her husband replied with a similar publication in which he accused his wife of trying to murder him. 'When people felt that they had come to the end of what they could expect from the legal system they would go public, publishing stories of their marital problems,' explains Dr Malay. 'They did it to make some money or to try to repair their reputation by getting their side of the story out.' Her new book, The Case of Mistress Mary Hampson, includes the full text of the 1684 pamphlet plus extensive extra material,  which examines the episode in depth and rounds out the story of Mary, who died in 1698, after a few short, final years of relative peace and prosperity.","Mary Hampson's harrowing story appears in a pamphlet published in 1684 .

The intelligence officer, who was married, flaunted his jet setting lifestyle and even entertained a mistress, who he dubbed his 'Wonder Woman,' gifting her with posh cadeaux like mink coats and fine jewelry. His lifestyle came under scrutiny but he allegedly was able to stave off inquiries from the IRS by couching his earnings as a matter of national security. But the good life came to an end when he was convicted in . 1983 for shipping 20 tons of C-4 plastic explosives to Libya in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and for other crimes, including attempted murder and criminal solicitation. Clearing his name: After his release from prison in 2003, Edwin Wilson worked to prove his innocence . At trial, he said he did it to ingratiate himself with the Libyan government at the CIA's request. Wilson was sentenced to 52 years in prison for the crimes. A federal judge threw out his conviction . in 2003, saying the government failed to correct information about . Wilson's service to the CIA that it admitted internally was false. He served 22 years in prison until he . was released in 2004. He then moved to Edmonds, Washington, north of . Seattle, to live with his brother. While in prison, he sought to prove his innocence by using the Freedom of Information Act to request government documents. Even after he was released, the man once described as a 'death merchant' and 'terrorist' worked to clear his name. 'I can't think of one thing I did that I have any guilt about,' Wilson told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in a 2006 interview. 'I didn't hurt anybody. I didn't get anyone killed.' Wilson . filed a civil lawsuit against seven former federal prosecutors and a . former executive director of the CIA, but a judge in Houston dismissed . the case in 2007. Wilson was born May 3, 1928, to a . farming family in Nampa, Idaho. He worked as a merchant seaman, and . earned a psychology degree from the University of Portland in 1953. He joined the Marines and fought in the last days of the Korean War, according to his death notice. He went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1955 after being discharged from the Marines. After leaving the CIA in 1971, he made millions in the arms trade and bought a sprawling farm in a tony county of Northern Virginia, where he entertained generals, CIA officials and congressmen, according to a 2004 Washington Post article. 'I had a couple of villas that were very, very nice,' he told the Washington Post at the time. 'I had Pakistani houseboys and I had Libyans working for me, typing up proposals in Arabic.' In 1982, he was lured out of hiding in Libya and brought to New York for arrest. A federal court in Virginia convicted him of exporting firearms to Libya without permission and sentenced him to 10 years. He was convicted in Texas in 1983, receiving a 17-year sentence for similar crimes. A New York court sentenced him to 25 years, to run consecutively with the Texas and Virginia sentences, for attempted murder, criminal solicitation and other charges involving claims that Wilson conspired behind bars to have witnesses and prosecutors killed.","Edwin P.

"Manchester City made Eliaquim Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football after paying £31.9million to sign the French centre back from FC Porto. Mangala’s protracted move to the Premier League champions finally went through on Monday with his transfer fee eclipsing the £30m deal that took Rio Ferdinand from Leeds to Manchester United in 2002. Mangala, 23, became City’s sixth signing of the summer after agreeing a five-year deal, and manager Manuel Pellegrini is confident that one of the most highly rated defenders in Europe will prove to be well worth the money. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Eliaquim Mangala score with a brilliant back heel volley . Done: Eliaquim Mangala has signed for Manchester City from Porto in £32million deal . Signed, sealed, delivered: Mangala has penned a five-year deal with the Premier League champions . All for one: Mangala joined fans on a tour of the Etihad Stadium after signing for Manchester City . Pose: The French defender had his picture taken alongside his new shirt at the Etihad Stadium . VIDEO Manchester City finally announce Mangala . City tried to sign Mangala and Porto pal Fernando in January but it’s taken until the summer to seal deals. Why the delay? Everything seemed ready to go last month, but negotiations stalled because a private company owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. Porto only received £23m of the £31.9m fee with the rest said to have been paid to Doyen Sports Investments. But isn’t he French? He was born in Paris but moved to Belgium at five, where he started as a striker. Standard Liege converted him to a defender and sold him to Porto for £6m. He is one of four Frenchmen at City, along with Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy. Despite his fee he couldn’t get a game for France at the World Cup and was their fourth-choice centre back. Didn’t United want him? And Chelsea. Asked about his preference in May, he said: ‘City or Chelsea? Chelsea because it’s London.’ Didn’t UEFA cap City’s net spend this summer at £49m? Yes, and they’ve spent £49.9m on Mangala, Fernando, Willy Caballero and Bruno Zuculini. Sagna was free and Frank Lampard is on loan. They got £10m from Sunderland for Jack Rodwell and £12m will follow when Javi Garcia joins Zenit St Petersburg. Mangala has the tools — power, pace and composure — to be the ideal partner for Vincent Kompany. CHRIS WHEELER . ‘I’m delighted to have added a player of Eliaquim’s quality in the squad,’ said Pellegrini, who saw his defence struggle in the 3-0 defeat by Arsenal in Sunday’s Community Shield. ‘He is already a fine player but in my opinion he has all the mental, physical, technical and tactical attributes to become one of Europe’s very best defenders. ‘Eliaquim is a player I believe will make an immediate impact in the Premier League, thanks to his physicality, his reading of the game and quality on the ball — I think he will prove to be a great signing for us.’ Having first made a move for Mangala in the January transfer window, City agreed terms with Porto and the player himself this summer but negotiations were held up because a private company, Doyen Sports Investments, owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. Third-party ownership of a player is prohibited under Premier League rules. Porto are only being paid £23m of the total fee with Belgian club Standard Liege receiving a small sell-on bonus under the terms of Mangala’s £6m move to Portugal three years ago. Mangala, who had also been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea, becomes the second Porto player to join City this summer following Fernando’s £12m move to the Etihad. Pellegrini has also signed goalkeeper Willy Caballero, defender Bacary Sagna and midfielder Bruno Zuculini, while former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard has arrived on a six-month loan from New York City. Mangala also becomes the fourth Frenchman on City’s books, joining Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy at the club. He was a member of France’s World Cup squad this summer, but did not play for Didier Deschamps’s side in Brazil. He is determined to add to his medal collection at City after winning league titles in Belgium and Portugal with Liege and Porto, but he admitted that it has been difficult training on his own while his future was resolved. Landed his man: Manuel Pellegrini identified the centre of defence as a problem area for the champions . Eliaquim Mangala - £32m . Porto to Man City, Aug 2014 . Luke Shaw - £31m (projected) Southampton to Man Utd, June 2014 . Rio Ferdinand - £30m . Leeds to Man Utd, July 2002 . Joleon Lescott - £22m . Everton to Man City, Aug 2009 . David Luiz - £21m . Benfica to Chelsea, Jan 2011 . ‘I am the kind of player that comes on the pitch to win,’ he said. ‘I am not giving away anything, I always fight until the end and I hope that we will win quite a lot of titles this season. ‘I am happy now because I will be able to start a new adventure. I will be able to train again. It was good to be on holidays, but after a time I started to find the time quite long. ‘I went on a run every day and trained in the gym. Holidays are great but if the time is too long, it is difficult to come back. I think that I will need a bit of time but I will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible. ‘City is a top club in Europe. For me, it was an important step to leave Porto and join Manchester City in order to continue my progress. I want to win titles and I believe I can do this. ‘I am ambitious and this is why I’m here. I’m very happy to come to England because for me, the Premier League is the best league in the world. It is a very intense and very aggressive competition. ‘The fact that Fernando is here is better because I played with him at Porto but there are also other players that I know like Sagna, Clichy and Nasri.’ Despite the record deal, City are still within their net transfer limit of £49m set by UEFA for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. Bad start: Willy Caballero struggled as Manchester City were beaten by Arsenal at Wembley . Mangala is expected to form a centre-back partnership with captain Vincent Kompany. With Pellegrini also having Martin Demichelis, Dedryck Boyata and Karim Rekik in his squad, Mangala’s arrival will push Matija Nastasic and Micah Richards closer to the exit following Joleon Lescott’s departure at the end of last season. Meanwhile goalkeeper Caballero has promised he will fight to keep Joe Hart out of the City starting line-up after being picked ahead of the England keeper for the Community Shield. It was not a debut to remember for Caballero, but the 32-year-old Argentine wants another chance when City launch their title defence at Newcastle, on Sunday. He said: ‘I want to be No 1. I will train for this weekend for the next decision to see who starts next week. Both of us will train for that chance. But I came to fight for the No 1 spot. My ambition is to fight for the position and to be there when the manager needs me. ‘This was an important match for me. I had a chance to play and am happy for this, but not happy with the score.’ Caballero was a £6m summer signing from Malaga where he worked with Pellegrini and his arrival has an ominous ring for Hart, who lost his place for two months last season when the City boss turned to Costel Pantilimon, who has since joined Sunderland. Caballero has clearly not moved to Manchester with the intention of sitting on the bench. ‘We have a strong team,’ he added. ‘We are the Premier League champions, with very good players, but we have things we need to prove.’","Manchester City wanted a partner for Vincent Kompany .

"Migaloo the albino whale has become somewhat of a celebrity on the east coast of New South Wales, with whale-watchers and tourists alike trying to catch a glimpse of the unique animal as he migrates north. However, there are fears that the majestic beast may in be in danger of health problems because of the pale colour of his skin. Red marks have been spotted on the humpback whale's dorsal fin and Whale expert Professor Peter Harrison from Southern Cross University told the ABC he is keen to look at recent photos to determine the cause. Scroll down for video . There are concerns Migaloo the humpback whale may be suffering from skin cancer due to his pale colour . He has examined some images taken of Migaloo off Cape Byron this week, and said some questions have been raised about whether Migaloo may be suffering from skin cancer. 'It will be very interesting to see whether or not this redness has disappeared, or whether or not it has obviously become more inflamed which would indicate some sort of infection and I guess there is a possibility that it might be early stages of cancer as well,' Professor Harrison said. 'Most people are curious as to whether or not this might be a preliminary form of skin cancer, but at this stage of course we simply can't tell.' The albino whale is one of only two in the world, the other is believed to be Norwegian . Photographer Ray Alley captured this stunning image of Migaloo at nelson Bay, north of Newcastle earlier this month . Experts say the red marks spotted on Migaloo could also be due to a collision with something during his migration . Professor Harrison also said there is some scratching and dicolouration in the same area, so there's a possibility he could have collided with something during his journey up Australia. Last week, an Australian photographer who had been trying to capture images of the albino humpback for nine years when his hard work paid off while whale-watching north of Newcastle. Veteran photographer Ray Alley managed to get some stunning pictures of Migaloo off the coast of Nelson Bay in NSW. The all-white Migaloo stopped off for a rare display of showmanship on his way through at Nelson Bay. Still getting over the shock of this amazing image, he told Daily Mail Australia today was the 'holy grail' in his 27-year photographic career: . The rare humpback was spotted in Cronulla, Sydney, earlier this month, putting on a show for photographers and onlookers . Migaloo was swimming in a 'competition pod' with four other Humpback whales as they tried to jostle one another for the leading position while heading north through Sydney earlier this month . Migaloo was seen off the Gold Coast near South Stradbroke Island in September 2012 . 'I expected to see him today, because I got the call from one of the guys at Imagine cruises saying 'we've got him'. But to get a full breach, it's kind of like seeing Madonna drop her gear on stage, you really want it to happen but you don't expect it too.' Migaloo shares his distinguishable albino appearance with just one other white whale in the world, a Norwegian. He was first sighted for the first time this year by a member of the public just off the coast of Green Cape in southern NSW on Tuesday. It is the 23rd consecutive year Migaloo has been spotted on the eastern seaboard, his first being in 1991 when he was sighted by marine biologist Dan Burns off the coast off Byron Bay. By Friday he will have made his way north of Newcastle, before reaching Queensland at the end of the month. He is being joined by others from the Australian East Coast Humpback whale population, leaving the cool waters of the Antarctic behind in search of Queensland's tropical warm paradise. The white whale has been seen at various points during his migration this year including against the backdrop of the Sydney skyline .","Red marks have been spotted on Migaloo's dorsal fin this week migrating through Cape Byron .

"In the street battle for supremacy between man and baboon, it can only be said that both sides are using guerrilla tactics. For the baboons it means swarming SAS style up the sheer sides of blocks of flats, prising open windows and plundering anything that is inside. Usually they just want food, but sometimes a flapping set of net curtains or a child’s cuddly toy bear can provide some added entertainment. For the humans, the weapons of choice – given that their enemy is a protected species – tend to be paintball guns and pepper sprays. They have the momentary effect of driving the baboons away, but hunger and sheer nerve always bring them back. Go away! An angry resident at the Cape Town apartment block is trying to scare off the group of Chacma Baboons (Papio ursinus) to no avail - he can be seen here in the centre of the picture shaking his fist at the monkeys from one of his windows . We'll have that: Two baboons have managed to get hold of a teddy bear through an open window into a child's bedroom in the building . As the pictures here show, these are the scenes which regularly affect life in Cape Town, South Africa, where man and baboon share a sometimes uncomfortable existence. Protected on the Cape Peninsula since 1999, there are now around 500 baboons living in 16 groups, increasingly cut off from their old, native habitats by the sprawling city. To survive, they trawl through waste bins, loiter at rubbish dumps, steal from shops and markets and prowl around the picnic sites. Some are such practised scavengers that they know exactly when the rubbish carts will be arriving with fresh supplies at the dump. Sweet tooth: A female baboon with young feeding on a discarded jar of peanut butter - the baboons trawl through waste bins and steal from shops and markets. Some even know when the rubbish carts will be arriving with fresh supplies . While some people don’t give a monkey’s about their vagrant neighbours even leaving out food for them, others go ape just at the thought of them. In the suburb of Scarborough, a woman screams at the pair of baboons sitting casually on the roof of her house munching hunks of pilfered brown bread. ‘No-one understands what is happening here! This is the complete nightmare’, she yells, explaining that a baboon recently snatched shopping from her daughter’s hands. ‘She is completely traumatised,’ she adds. ‘It is not even safe to leave the house. And no-one does anything about it.’ A neighbour hurls a futile stick at them – but they carry on munching. ‘I hate them,’ he says. Not far away in Main Street, employees at a safari company have just discovered what happens if you go away for the week-end and leave a window open. A group of baboons led by a male called Moby has left a trail of destruction in the staff kitchen. First target was the fridge where every packet has been opened, investigated and eaten. The menu runs to bread, pasta, cheese, peppers, eggs, carrots, tuna and corn. Others preferred the contents of the rubbish bin. Suffice to say, the animals didn’t bother to use the staff toilets. At the Groot Constantia vineyard, manager Jean Naude laments the loss of vines and grapes he suffers every year because of the 40 resident baboons he is powerless to stop – except by paying for the whole estate to be fenced off. Fight for life: a hungry baboon tries to steal vegetables from a shopper near the apartment block in Cape Town, South Africa . ‘We are sitting on a time bomb. Something has got to happen,’ he says. ‘In the Spring they eat the young shoots,  in summer the grapes. If the nature conservation authority would allow it, we would shoot them all. Every one of them.’ But many people admire the ingenuity of the baboons and are prepared to rub along with customers who never pay for anything. At a small supermarket between the settlements of Welcome Glen and Da Gama Park, a baboon called Quandi calls in once or twice a week. ‘He goes directly to the fruit stand and takes a few kilos of bananas,’ says the manageress. ‘Then he runs past the check out to the shelves with the crisps. He seems to prefer cheese and onion.’ As she speaks, a baboon enters . nonchalantly as if on cue, seizes a 5lb bag of apples and exits to a . field next door where he proceeds to eat them, watched enviously by . other members of the group. It is said that screaming hysterically at the baboons only makes things worse. ‘Baboons infer from the fear and panic of people, that they themselves . rank higher in the pecking order,’ says animal  behaviour expert Rachel . Noser who studied the Cape colonies for 16 months. ‘And therefore they . think are entitled to everything that these people have with them. One of the baboons found a nice blue blanket in somebody's apartment - the owner forgot to shut the window . ‘The baboons have no intention of harming people. They just want to get high quality food in as short a time as possible. So, if you forget to close the door they will smell the food and go and get it. It saves energy by not having to walk miles and it also doesn’t need to worry about being eaten by a leopard or a lion.’ The Cape now spends hundreds of thousands of pounds on schemes to monitor the baboons, including squads of rangers and a help hotline. Although it is illegal to kill the animals, dozens are injured or killed each year – some in accidents, but others from brutal attacks from people who have caught them ransacking their property. Others have been ‘euthanised’ by the authorities for the crime of being a persistent problem. Jenni Trethowan, who has earned herself the nickname The Baboon Lady for her support of the animals through her charity Baboon Matters Trust, says the authorities are over-reacting to the problem. ‘For hundreds of years baboons and humans have interacted here on the Cape peninsula,’ she says. ‘Photographs from the 1950s show smiling folk with baboons sitting on their vehicles, and letters describe picnics at the point – with baboon rascals stealing the sandwiches. What has changed from those scenarios? – only our attitudes it seems. ‘Now we live in fear of law suits, fear of safety and security – and we forget that aggression creates aggression, we forget that our attitude is the most important influence we can bring to bear. Those who treat the baboons with respect and understanding, taking all necessary precautions to minimise interactions, seem to have few problems – but those who rage and shoot – well they don’t really achieve too much at all, and certainly don’t resolve any problems.’ Another resident has just lost their pink curtains. The monkeys ripped the fabric from the rails above this open window .","Baboons swarm SAS style up the sides of blocks of flats, opening windows .

"An incredible video has shown the nail-biting moment a seaplane came within inches of landing on a humpback whale. The footage taken by witness Thomas Mann last week shows the near-collision in the remote Alaskan village of Angoon, which is only accessible by boat or plane. On the video, a de Havilland Beaver seaplane from Juneau can be seen trying to land and getting within inches of the surface before suddenly accelerating away from the water. Scroll down for video . Landing: A de Havilland Beaver seaplane gets within inches of landing on water - unaware a whale is below . Approach: The seaplane almost lands as the humpback whale forces air through its blowhole, circled right . 'All the sudden, the pilot advanced the throttle and I didn't know why. I thought, ""Oh something must be wrong"",' Hamm told CNN. But if you watch the video closely you can see water being forced upwards through the whale's blowhole as the plane attempts to land. After he decides to accelerate again, the pilot soars through a cloud of droplets from the blowhole before eventually landing safely. 'Damn near landed right on that f***ing whale!' one shocked witness can be heard yelling on the video, with another adding: 'He had to go right over it!' Near miss: Reacting to the commotion from people along the shore, the pilot decides against landing on the water - just as he flies through the droplets forced up by the whale . Relief: Witnesses along the shore exhale with relief as the seaplane makes a safe landing moments later . Scene: The seaplane landed on the Alaska island of Angoon - which is only accessible by plane or boat . Hamm said he showed the video to the pilot, who had no idea he was flying above the humpback whale. Instead, he had decided to put off his landing after seeing people on the shore pointing and yelling. After the pilot pulled away, the whale breached, Hamm said - and they all agreed the pilot had had a lucky escape.","A de Havilland Beaver seaplane narrowly avoided colliding with a whale near Angoon, Alaska last week .

"A wheelchair-bound council equalities adviser who arranged to have sex with a five-year-old girl and her mother at a Travelodge has been jailed for two-and-a-half years today. Andrew Holdsworth-Wild, 59, bragged online that he loves to ‘have kids play with me’ as he arranged to meet the mother, who was actually an undercover police officer. The Westminster Council officer was arrested by waiting police at Victoria Station in central London with condoms, a box of . Smarties, a colouring book and train tickets to Maidstone, Kent. Prison: Andrew Holdsworth-Wild, who suffers from muscular dystrophy, was jailed for two-and-a-half years today . Covert officer ‘Jo’ made contact with . Holdsworth-Wild through the True Nudist website, as he sought out sex . with her fictional daughter ‘Chloe’, Southwark Crown Court heard. The conversations then moved to an MSN . forum where he said he enjoyed getting naked with his imaginary . ‘daughter’ and liked ‘playing, having sex and sexy times’. Holdsworth-Wild also said he would ‘love to play with a family’ and made incestuous suggestions to Jo. Holdsworth-Wild, Truro, . Cornwall, who has muscular dystrophy, wept . as he was jailed today and begged not to be handcuffed to a dock officer . as he was led from the court to begin his sentence. He had denied a single count of arranging or facilitating the . commission of a child sex offence but was convicted after a retrial. Gregory Fishwick, for Holdsworth-Wild, tried to persuade the judge to pass a suspended prison sentence, adding: ‘It is a simple example that for this man, life with a custody sentence would affect him far greater than any other sort of defendant.’ But Judge John Price said an immediate jail sentence was the only way of dealing with Holdsworth-Wild. ‘I have no doubt he intended, had he been able to do so, to commit the act’, he said. ‘There are powerful points of mitigation, but in my judgement it has to be an immediate custody sentence.' He was arrested at Victoria Station and he was carrying condoms, a colouring book and Smarties . Holdsworth-Wild was convicted after a retrial in April of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, nearly two years after his arrest on July 21, 2011. He was sacked from his position as inclusion and access officer after an internal probe by the council. He also admitted possessing a level one indecent image of a child at the start of his original trial in August 2012. Prosecutor James Norman said: ‘This case is, in short, about the defendant’s efforts to have sex with a five-year-old girl. ‘Between February and July, 2011, he made arrangements to have a sexual encounter with a five-year-old girl called Chloe and her mother, Jo. ‘On July 21, he went to Victoria Station to meet Jo and Chloe and was going to take them to a Travelodge in Kent where he stayed for work. ‘He brought a box of condoms and while he waited for them to arrive, he also bought a box of Smarties and a colouring book. Holdsworth-Wild wept as he was sentenced on Wednesday at Southwark Crown Court . ‘Fortunately Chloe does not exist and Jo is an undercover police officer. ‘The only people who met him (at Victoria) were other police officers who arrested him. ‘The defendant intentionally arranged to have a sexual encounter with Chloe, a five-year-old girl.’ Holdsworth-Wild admitted the online conversations, but claimed during it was merely a fantasy that he never intended to go through with. A covert internet investigator called ‘Gary’ was deployed to the True Nudist website to snare paedophiles on May 22, 2011, Mr Norman said. ‘He then suggested moving the conversation to MSN. From that point onwards, unbeknown to Mr Holdsworth-Wild, the conversation was being recorded by police.’ Mr Fishwick said he was suffering depression and coping with debt problems in a ‘lonely’ existence away from his wife at the time of the offence. ‘He was in effect living a lonely life in a motel in Maidstone’, he said. ‘Those potential triggers no longer exist for this man.’ He said Holdsworth-Wild is still saddled with £50,000 of debt and living off benefits, while he and his wife care for each other. He will be under a 12-year sex offences prevention order when he is released from prison.","Andrew Holdsworth-Wild, 59, was caught in an undercover police operation .

"Welcome to a real-life Temple of Doom where you can re-enact Indiana Jones' wildest adventures by sliding down a Mayan temple into shark infested waters. The water slide styled as a Mayan temple sends thrillseekers hurtling up to 35-miles-per-hour down a 60-foot-long chute. The ride finishes underwater by going through a tunnel surrounded by 14-foot-long nurse sharks and Caribbean Reef sharks. The Mayan Temple water slide in the Bahamas, a detailed replica of the Temple of Doom, is the ultimate ride for Indiana Jones-style thrillseekers . Thanks to an ingenious underwater passage, intrepid visitors can zoom through shark-infested waters . The terrifying ride takes visitors down a steep chute before hurtling them through a tube surrounded by 14-foot-long nurse sharks and Caribbean Reef sharks . Aptly called The Leap of Faith, the terrifying ride is part of the Aquaventure, Paradise Island resort of the Bahamas. Vice President of Marine Operations, Mark Gsellman explained why the slide is so popular with the visitors to his resort. 'The Leap of Faith was built to provide guests with the ultimate experience. 'No other slide compares to the exhilarating sensation and rush of adrenaline you're left with after going down the Leap of Faith. Shooting through the air, the ride can send visitors plummeting at 35 mph . As tourists reach the bottom of the slide, they enter a misty tunnel before going underwater, hence the name Leap of Faith . Tourists get a rare view up through the water from the imitation sea bed . 'The feeling of being dropped at a near perpendicular angle and flying past sharks is something you can't find anywhere else. 'The slide is called the Leap of Faith because the bottom of the slide is covered with a mist and cannot be seen, hence to drop down, it requires a true leap of faith.' Aquaventure is a vast 141-acre water park containing 7 million gallons of water, a mile-long river ride, and a choice of 12 pools. Alongside the life-size replica of a Mayan Temple, there is a 131-foot tall Power Tower, a 7-acre snorkeling lagoon, miles of white sand beaches and more. The Mayan Temple replica is full-size, so that it dominates the skyline on Paradise Island . The seaside paradise Aquaventure, which is one of the largest water parks in the world, also has a 131-foot tall Power Tower and a 7-acre snorkeling lagoon . 'People love the Leap of Faith and certainly go through a range of emotions,' said Mark. 'Guests are first and foremost very excited, but typically grow anxious as they wait for their turn. 'Nerves tend to kick in once guests realize they are up next, and after a few minutes of fear and giddy nervousness. 'Then they finally launch themselves down the slide and experience some of the most fun you can imagine.

Thamsanqa Jantjie, 34, a South African sign language interpreter accused of making up his own signs . Mr Jantjie, 34, stood just a few feet from President Obama and others who spoke at the ceremony . His actions were questioned when it was claimed he was signing words like 'prawns' and 'rocking horse'. Jantjie's explanation was that he had suffered a schizophrenic episode in which he had 'seen angels and heard voices'. But in a television interview, his wife showed a bag full of medication he takes for his condition. She said she took her husband to Sterkfontein Hospital in Krugersdorp for a check-up where it was suggested that he be admitted immediately. Mr Jantjie gesticulates at his home during an interview in Johannesburg, South Africa . 'I would like to tell everybody that if I've offended anyone, please, forgive me,' Mr Jantjie said . 'The past few days have been hard. We have been supportive because he might have had a breakdown,' Siziwe said. Jantjie was supposed to attend a check-up at Sterkfontein on December 10. However, . when he was offered the job to interpret at the memorial service, . Siziwe called the hospital on his behalf and asked that he be given . another date. South African news website eNCA . reported that Mr Jantjie has faced charges for rape (1994), theft . (1995), housebreaking (1997), malicious damage to property (1998), . murder, attempted murder and kidnapping (2003) charges. The . website said it was unclear if the 2003 murder case was ever concluded . as the court file was found to be empty during their investigations. Mr Jantjie said that his hallucinations began while he was interpreting and that . he tried not to panic because there were 'armed policemen around me.' When Mr Jantjie was shown video footage of him interpreting on stage at the Mandela memorial service he said 'I don't remember any of this at all' He added that he was once hospitalised in a mental health facility for more than one year. Jantjie said he worked for a company called SA Interpreters which had . been hired by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) for the ceremony at Johannesburg's . 95,000-seat Soccer City stadium. He said he was paid 85 dollars (£52) for interpreting the event. But he also apologised for his performance that has been dismissed by many sign-language experts as gibberish. 'I . would like to tell everybody that if I've offended anyone, please, . forgive me,' Mr Jantjie said in his concrete home in a low-income . Johannesburg neighbourhood . 'But what I was doing, I was doing what I believe is my calling, I was doing what I believe makes a difference.' 'What . happened that day, I see angels come to the stadium ... I start . realising that the problem is here. And the problem, I don't know the . attack of this problem, how will it comes. Sometimes I react violent on . that place. Sometimes I will see things that chase me,' Mr Jantjie said. 'I was in a very . difficult position,' he added. 'And remember those people, the president . and everyone, they were armed, there was armed police around me. If I . start panicking I'll start being a problem. I have to deal with this in a . manner so that I mustn't embarrass my country.' Asked how often he had become violent, he said 'a lot' while declining to provide details. Mr Jantjie . said he was due on the day of the ceremony to get a regular six-month . mental health checkup to determine whether the medication he takes was . working, whether it needed to be changed or whether he needed to be kept . at a mental health facility for treatment. Claims: Braam Jordaan, a deaf South African and board member of the World Deaf Federation, claimed the man was simply making up his own signs . Address: U.S. President Barack Obama addresses the crowd while the interpreter stands next to him . Mis-matched: The man's movement's did not match that of the official interpreter, left . He . said he did not tell the company that contracted him for the event for . about $85 that he was due for the checkup, but said the owner of SA . Interpreters in Johannesburg was aware of his condition. Jantjie . said he received one year of sign language interpretation at a school . in Cape Town, and insisted that he has previously interpreted at many . events without anyone complaining. When footage was shown to Jantjie of him interpreting on stage at the Mandela memorial service, he said: 'I don't remember any of this at all.' A South African deputy cabinet minister admitted 'a mistake happened' in hiring Mr Jantjie. Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu said that government officials have tried to track down the company that provided Mr Jantjie but that the owners 'have vanished into thin air.' Deputy Minister of Women, Children and People with Disabilities Bogopane-Zulu apologised to deaf people offended around the world by what they say was Jantjie's incomprehensible signing. She says an investigation was under way to determine how Jantjie received a security clearance. South Africa's leading deaf association claimed he was a fake and said he was inventing signs. The ANC has also denied knowing about him although footage from two large ANC events last year showed him signing . on stage next to President Jacob Zuma. Mr Jantjie has apologised for the incident and said he did not know what triggered the attack, saying he took medication for his schizophrenia .","Thmsanqa Jantjie, 34, performed fake sign language during memorial .

"Anyone in Texas knows you must always remember the Alamo. It would also be advised that you always remember to delete the nude photos you took of yourself and then sent to a man who isn't your husband - just ask Melinda Navarro, the Executive Administrator at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio. Navarro currently is engaged in a bitter divorce with her soon-to-be ex-husband, Larry Navarro, who is taking bitter to some rather staggering levels. After discovering nude photos his wife had taken of herself and then sent to another man, Mr. Navarro reportedly went ahead and forwarded the images to his wife's friends, work colleagues, her parents and even the couple's 16-year-old daughter. Daughter of the Republic: Melinda Navarro is being asked to resign her post as Executive Administrator of the Alamo after bitter divorce proceedings revealed she text messaged naked pictures of herself to a man that wasn't her husband . The existence of the photos was revealed in divorce proceedings earlier this week when Mr. Navarro filed a motion to examine a laptop computer and to hear testimony from the man he believes received the risque photos - as well as sexually charged text messages - from his wife. As a public employee making $85,000 a year, Ms. Navarro has admitted to sending the photos and texts via-a cell phone used for both personal and Alamo business, according to the San Antonio Express-News. However, she denies ever having an affair. Navarro, seen here nuzzling an unidentified child . In a 39-page child custody investigation report for the couple's two teenage children - first published by a Texas blogger - the author notes that 'Ms. Navarro stated that around her anniversary last year there had been an argument... and Larry had taken her phone, found some texts and photos that she had sent to a man, and forwarded a number of the personal photos to her parents, daughter, co-workers, and social circle.' The report goes on to say that 'she stated that her co-workers were obviously uncomfortable the next day and finally a man showed her a nude photo with the caption, ""Look what het (sic) Alamo is paying for!"" When she learned of Navarro's action, she separated from him on September 17, 2012, and filed for divorce two days later.' Remember: the Battle of the Alamo is considered the turning point of the Texas Revolution and has become one of the state's most recognizable landmarks . Ms. Navarro's sexting is just the latest black-eye for the Alamo - and the organization of women that has been tasked with maintaining it for the last 108 years. Ms. Navarro is a member of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, a group of Texas women that - until recently - has been in charge of overseeing several Texas landmarks, including the Alamo, the Shrine of Texas Freedom and the French Legation Embassy. The group has become controversial in recent years and has garnered a slue of bad press - so bad, in fact, that the Texas Legislature stripped it of its duties of maintaining the historic landmark last year - a duty with which it has been entrusted since 1905. You can leave your hat on: Navarro has a case of puppy love in this much-less-revealing photo than the shots she allegedly sent to a man who wasn't her husband . But group still maintains the Alamo - it does so, however, as state contractor under the Texas General Land Office, which appoints an executive administrator. Navarro fell into her current position after the appointed executive administrator resigned last year after just five months on the job and was never replaced. The Daughters of the Republic of Texas' contract with the state ends this month, but that hasn't stopped several people - including state legislators and members if the Daughters of the Republic of Texas - from calling on Navarro to resign. Navarro is paid $85,000 a year in taxpayer money to run the Alamo . 'I . have repeatedly asked for a strong state presence at the Alamo, and . this new information does not add confidence to the management,” Texas state Senator Leticia Van de . Putte told the San Antonio Express-News. Former DRT member Sarah Reveley, who was booted from the group after complaining to the Texas Attorney General's Office about how poorly the group was taking care of the Alamo, thinks it's time for Navarro to go. “Divorces should be private . business, but her key $85,000-a-year position at the Alamo makes her a . public figure,” Reveley posted on her Facebook page. Navarro fell into the top spot at the Alamo when the man appointed to her position quit last year after just five months on the job . Navarro, seen here with two unidentified children .

"When the Danish prime minister was asked if she'd  reveal the controversial selfie she took at Nelson Mandela's memorial service she said, resoundingly, no. Helle Thorning-Schmidt later told a Danish newspaper the photo was not 'particularly good' and sources have since revealed she wanted to delete it. But, despite facing a barrage of criticism for posing in it, British Prime Minister David Cameron is taking a very different view. It has emerged that during a private . conversation last week, Cameron apparently suggested to the Dane that . auctioning it for charity could raise a substantial sum. For our eyes only: The controversial selfie,  pictured, will not be . shared with the public, the Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt . said . A source familiar with the exchange told The Sunday Times: 'Helle wanted to delete it, but Cameron urged her not to. He pointed out that it could raise a lot of money.' However, Downing Street refused to confirm if the conversation took place when contacted by MailOnline today or, if it did, what was said. Thorning-Schmidt - who took the photo of herself, President Obama, and Mr Cameron during the service - did not reveal whether she would delete the image or just refrain from showing it to the public. Speaking to Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet, she said: 'It isn't a particularly good picture.' The Danish prime minister previously defended the selfie saying that the trio of world leaders were just 'having a bit of fun'. U.S. President Barack Obama (right) and British Prime Minister David Cameron pose for a picture with Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt (centre) The selfie shot happened during the memorial service of South African former president Nelson Mandela at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on December 10 . The selfie led to a backlash from Twitter users who said it was inappropriate behaviour at an event to remember the life of the anti-apartheid hero . She added that the relaxed picture was in-keeping with the spirit of the event. The . Dane, who is married to former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock's son . Stephen, 42, has enjoyed a glamorous reputation in her native country . since becoming prime minister in 2011. She said: 'There were lots of pictures taken that day, and I just thought it was a bit of fun. 'Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun.' In an interview with Danish Daily Berlinske, she . added: 'There was a sadness, but it was basically a festive event that . also celebrated a man who has lived for 95 years and achieved so much in . his life. 'There was dancing on the stands. And then we took a really fun selfie.'

"Philips' SlimStyle light bulb, pictured, promises a comparable brightness to a 60W bulb instantly . Fumbling around in the dark to replace a lightbulb could soon become a thing of the past – or at least a task you only have to carry out every quarter of a century or so. A new flat lightbulb, the world’s first of its kind to go on sale, has been launched by Philips. The company promises its SlimStyle LED bulb is more efficient, less likely to break than other bulbs and will last for 23 years. The bulb has a round shape to the front but is flat when viewed from the side so it is less three-dimensional than we’re used to. It is covered in rubber and has LED lights arranged in a horseshoe shape on the inside. The Dutch electronics manufacturer said it lasts 25 times longer than a traditional 60W incandescent bulb but has a similar output. And unlike some other energy-saving bulbs, it lights up instantly. Existing LED bulbs last for around 10,000 hours, while a halogen lightbulb lasts 1,000 hours. But Philips said the new bulb should last 25,000 hours, which will mean nearly 23 years of use if lit for an average of just under three hours a day. It is claimed that each bulb reduces energy consumption by 85 per cent, bringing electricity savings of £80 over its lifetime. The company said the improvement to energy-efficient lightbulbs – which are often criticised for being more expensive and duller than classic filament bulbs – is down to advances in LED technology. The SlimStyle lightbulb went on sale this week in the US for $10 (£6) and will be made available in Britain if sales are successful. Mike Simpson, technical and design director at Philips UK, said: ‘The new design is expected to make LED lighting more cost-effective for the householder.’ The SlimStyle lamp, pictured, has a lifespan of 25,000 hours, according to Phillips, while a halogen light bulb lasts on average 1,000 hours. The LED light bulb is set to go on sale this month in the U.S. for less than $10 (£6) and come over to the UK if sales are successful .","Bulb lasts ten times longer than its energy-saving halogen counterpart .

"Not going: President and Mrs. Obama won't make the trip to Sochi, in what is seen as a huge snub to Russian President Vladimir Putin . President Obama, Vice President Biden, and their families will skip the opening or closing ceremonies of the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, breaking with recent tradition that has seen very senior White House officials in attendance when athletes from around the world arrive for competition. The move will be seen as a snub of Russian President Vladimir Putin, since the last four Olympics saw far more senior administration officials in attendance. And adding to the in-your-face decision, the U.S. will include an openly gay athlete, Billie Jean King, among its luminaries when the Sochi games open – in defiance of Russia's new national anti-gay laws. The last time an Olympic Games kicked . off without an American president, vice president, first lady or former . president in attendance was 2000, when the event was held in Sydney, . Australia. First lady Michelle Obama went to London in 2012 for the opening of the Summer Olympics. In 2010, Vice President Joe Biden led the U.S. delegation at the ceremonies in Vancouver, Canada. And then-President George W. Bush traveled halfway around the world to Beijing, China when the summer games opened there in 2008. Former President Bill Clinton lobbied Bush to boycott the Beijing games, criticizing China's reaction to violence in Tibet and its inaction in the face of genocide in Darfur. But Bush ultimately decided to attend. The White House announced Tuesday afternoon that the official delegations for the Sochi opening and closing ceremonies will include U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Robert Nabors and Deputy Secretary of State William Burns. No one from the first family of the Biden family was included, nor was any current member of the president's cabinet. Scroll down for video . Frequent flyer?

Canada 1, Russia 0: Vice President Joe Biden yukked it up with with members of the US Olympic Snowboarding team during the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, but he's staying home in February 2014 . Janet Napolitano, who left her job as Homeland Security secretary this year to become president of the University of California in September, will lead the delegation at the opening ceremony. American sports luminaries joining the group at the opening ceremonies will include tennis legend Billie Jean King and figure skating gold medalist Brian Boitano. Obama's delegation to the closing . ceremonies in Sochi will include speed skaters Bonnie Blair and Eric . Heiden, along with women's ice hockey star Caitlin Cahow. The presence of the openly gay King on Feb. 7 in Sochi is likely a direct slam on Russia's anti-homosexuality laws; but Dmitry Chernyshenko, who leads Russia's Olympic organizing committee, has said there will be no repercussions against athletes who wear rainbow pins or show other small-scale disdain for the government policy.

In June Russia's parliament passed legislation banning what it called 'propaganda' about gay lifestyles, which it terms 'nontraditional sexual relations.' Lawmakers said the measure was required in order to protect the well-being of children. Russian President Vladimir Putin has banned demonstrations and organized protests during, before and immediately after the Olympics. But the International Olympic Committee has decided to designate 'protest zones' in Sochi – likely far away from TV cameras – in order to funnel discontent into a manageable area. Tensions with Russia reached a boiling point this year after national security leaker Edward Snowden fled there with what administration officials now admit were 'millions' of state secrets. Putin has granted him temporary asylum, and the U.S. government is resisting calls to offer him an amnesty in exchange for the secure return of the intelligence he stole.

"Scientists have discovered a way to hide large objects from sight using inexpensive and readily available lenses. Known as 'cloaking', the process involves hiding an object from view while everything else around it appears undisturbed. And this particular device, called the Rochester Cloak, uses four lenses in a line at specific distances from each other to make objects appear invisible. Scroll down for a video explanation . Scientists at the University of Rochester in New York have shown off a method to make objects invisible using a system of lenses. Here doctoral student Joseph Choi is pictured with a the so-called multidirectional `perfect paraxial' cloak using four lenses to make part of his face invisible - while the grid appears intact behind . The technique was developed by scientists at the University of Rochester in New York. The Rochester Cloak is not a tangible cloak, though; rather, it's a series of layered lenses that makes an object at the right distance disappear. However, this is one of the first cloaking methods to hide objects in three directions when viewed at varying angles in visible light. In July researchers developed a breakthrough technique that enabled them to build 'invisible' materials out of light. The method uses light like a needle to thread long chains of particles. And, the scientists claimed, it could be an important step towards building invisibility cloaks. The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, described how engineering materials at a nanoscale level can induce invisibility. Materials just a few billionths of a metre across can be built to alter the way in which light passes through them. Known as a 'metamaterial', these can be designed to reflect light in the 'wrong' way. 'From what we know this is the first cloaking device that provides three-dimensional, continuously multidirectional cloaking,' said Joseph Choi, a graduate student who helped develop the method at Rochester, which is renowned for its optical research. To make the device, four lenses need to be aligned at a precise length. The lenses then need to be paired up and separated by the sum of their focal lengths - which is the distance from the lens that an object comes into focus. Doing this will make objects that are placed between the third and fourth lens, or specific positions between the others, invisible. But the background behind the equipment will remain visible when viewed through other lenses. Scaling up the sizes of the lenses can then also increase the size of the cloaking effect. Their simple configuration improves on other cloaking devices, but it's not perfect. 'This cloak bends light and sends it through the center of the device, so the on-axis region cannot be blocked or cloaked,' said Choi. This means that the cloaked region is shaped like a doughnut. He added that they have slightly more complicated designs that solve the problem. Also, the cloak has edge effects, but these can be reduced when sufficiently large lenses are used. Here the setup of the multidirectional `perfect paraxial' cloak is seen from the side. The laser shows the paths that light rays travel through the system, showing the region where objects can be cloaked. This region is between the two lenses on the left hand side where the lines converge . By aligning four lenses in a certain manner an object is made 'invisible'. The background behind the object remains visible (shown) as light bends around. The scientists say it is the first cloaking device to provide multidirectional cloaking. And the technique could also be used to let surgeons see through their hands . To test the device, which cost about £600 ($1,000) to put together the researchers placed an object in front of a grid background. When they looked through the lenses and changed their viewing angle, they found the grid shifted but the object remained invisible. In addition there was no discontinuity in the grid lines, making the effect seem more convincing. They say the technique has some useful potential applications, such as letting a surgeon look through their hands at they are operating, and helping truck drivers see through blind spots. The research was published in a paper submitted to the journal Optics Express. To make the device four lenses need to be aligned at a precise length (illustration shown). The lenses need to be paired up and separated by the sum of their focal lengths - which is the distance from the lens that an object comes into focus. Doing this will make objects that are placed between the third and fourth lens invisible .","Scientists at the University of Rochester in New York have shown off a method to make objects invisible using a system of lenses .

"An off-road racing enthusiast and rodeo clown has survived being struck by lightning twice during the same harrowing storm in St. Jo, Texas on Saturday. Casey Wagner, 31, said on Sunday that doctors told him a tingling feeling all throughout his body would last for about a week. Miraculously, tingling is the worst of Wagner's injuries. KTVT-TV  reports Wagner was at an off-road competition in Saint Jo, 85 miles northwest of Dallas, when storms arrived. The event, named Rednecks with Paychecks, hosts hundreds of racers who also camp out at the huge site. Casey Wagner is one lucky rodeo clown after surviving being struck by lightning twice at a 'Rednecks with Paychecks' event on Saturday . Wagner and two of his friends were searching for shelter from the storm when they stopped under a tree. One of his friends ran off to find a bathroom while Wagner was left beneath the tree with his friend's father. He was standing 5 feet away from his friend's father when he was struck by lightning--twice. He dropped to his knees then he was struck again. Wagner says he saw sparks during the strikes. He felt electricity in his chest and the feeling then shot up through his arm and left wrist. Wagner ran with friends beneath a tree to seek shelter from the storm in Texas on Saturday . Wagner tells KTVT-TV how he felt the lightning move through his chest and all throughout his left arm and wrist . 'What I remember is just a loud boom and it dropped me to my knees and then it hit me again,' Wagner said. 'When I got hit, it was just two big ol’ flashes and then sparks went everywhere.' A nurse who happened to be nearby cared for Wagner until he was taken to Nacona General Hospital a few miles away where he was treated and released. 'At the hospital they said the poncho I was wearing was carrying static because it was one of those plastic ones,' Wagner told KTVT-TV. Rednecks with Paychecks is an off road competition in St. Jo, Texas where hundreds of racers camp at the huge site . As if saved by some miracle, Wagner's injuries are nothing but a little shakiness. Wagner told doctors that he believed his heart skipped a beat. He lost feeling in his lower right leg and his left arm. 'I’ve got all the feeling back. It just feels like my whole body is waking up from… like if your arm falls asleep, that’s how my whole body feels,' According to doctors, Wagner should regain feeling in about a week. Wagner told Mail Online, 'I'm still weak and tingly. If symptoms don't get better within a week I'll go back to the doctor.' Wagner says he believes God kept him alive. 'I give everything to God,' he said. 'So I owe everything to him, he’s the one that kept me alive. I can tell you one thing, I’m going to start going to church more.' When asked how the experience changed him, Wagner laughed and told Mail Online, 'I don't take life for granted anymore. Reminds me to keep on living life and not act stupid.'","' I don't take life for granted anymore,' Wagner told Mail Online .

"The start of Sydney's whale-watching season has kicked off in spectacular fashion, with up to 10 humpback whales spotted off Bondi Beach and near Botany Bay. A treat for those making the most the unusually warm autumn weather, two humpbacks were seen playing with a pod of dolphins off Bondi Beach on Saturday morning. This was followed by another five seen around the same area in the afternoon. Jonas Liebschner from Whale Watching Sydney said the large number of animals sighted was extraordinary, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Welcome: The start of the whale-watching season kicked off with a stellar number of humpback whales spotted of the Bondi Beach coast, pictured, and Botany Bay in Sydney's south east . Frolicking: The pods of whales were seen playing together off the coast, to the admiration of onlookers who were keen to catch a glimpse of the majestic animals . '(It) is a phenomenal number for this early in the season,' he said. Mr Liebschner confirmed that four humpbacks were also spotted near Botany Bay, in Sydney's south east. But those who missed out should not fret, with more expected throughout the season. Mr Liebschner said whale numbers had steadily increased by about 10 per cent in the last five to six years. As part of their migration, about 20,000 whales will travel north past Sydney as they make their way to sub-tropical breeding grounds off the Queensland coast. On their way back, this number is expect to be about 22,000 whales, with the addition of 2,000 newborn calves, Mr Liebschner said. Making a splash: Adult humpback whales can grown up to 16 metres long as adults and weigh more than 36,000 kilograms . More than 20,000 humpbacks are expected to pass Sydney as they head north to warmer waters off the Queensland coast . As part of their migration from Antarctic waters, the whales make 5,000km trip along Australia's east coast . For those hoping to catch a glimpse of a humpback or many of the other species of whale, the mammals will complete the 5,000km trip along Australia's east coast from Antarctic waters - one of the longest in the animal kingdom - in the coming months. The whales' northern migration can run into August and they often travel in pods and along the Great Barrier Reef before arriving in the Whitsundays area, according to Discover Hervey Bay. Once in warmer waters the animals give birth and mate before making their way to Antarctic waters by the end of spring. On their southern migration, most humpbacks will leave the Queensland coast by the start of November. Humpbacks, which can grow up to about 16 metres as adults and weigh more than 36,000 kilograms, spend the summer feeding on prawn-like krill in Antarctic waters. Large whales are most likely to be seen in Australian waters between June and October, according to ABC. About 40 species of whales and dolphins have been recorded in Australian waters. To best see the whales, watchers should pick a clear and calm day on a prominent headland.","Up to 10 humpback whales spotted off the Sydney coast have marked the start of the whale-watching season .

"Children shrieked in disgust as removal men tore the tail off a whale carcass in a botched attempt to take it from the beach where it had washed up. It took 20 helpers and two industrial diggers to haul the 20-tonne southern right whale on to a flatbed truck, before being driven to a landfill site. The clean-up job was captured by British photographer Dan Beecham, 30, at Sunset Beach outside Cape Town, South Africa, against a backdrop of the city's distinctive Table Mountain. A whale carcass lies beached near Cape Town, South Africa: It is thought that the 20-tonne southern right whale washed ashore after being hit by a boat . Dead: The whale's tongue lolls out as water laps against its lifeless body and a digger approaches to begin the process of carrying it away . Huge: The massive marine mammal weighed 20 tonnes and was 10 metres long . A lonely figure: Cape Town's Table mountain can be seen rising majestically on the horizon behind the whale carcass . Unusual sight: Curious passers-by gathered to gawp at the dead beast and take photographs of their own . Behemoth: A girl stands by the carcass, her small frame showing in comparison the massive size of the massive animal . Frolicking: Children run near to the whale carcass, before removal men accidentally ripped off its tail and turned everyone's stomachs . Close up view: Photographer Dan Beecham didn't describe the smell of the dead whale, but it's probably safe to assume that it wasn't very pleasant . Scavengers: Sea gulls circle overhead, perhaps hoping to get a beak-full of putrefying whale blubber for breakfast . He said: 'When I arrived a small crowd had gathered around the beached male. A few minutes after I arrived, representatives from the City of Cape Town authorities arrived and set up a cordon. 'The authorities got to work right away to get the whale off the beach. 'But one botched attempt involved trying to drag the poor beast from its tail but it ended in the lifting strop tearing through the tail, pulling it clean off with a disturbing guttural sound, followed by screams of horror from all the on-looking children.' After three hours the 10m-long whale was eventually lifted on to the flatbed and driven away to be disposed of. Here come the fuzz: A member of the local 'Law Enforcement' spies the dead whale lying forlornly on the practically empty beach . Heavy duty equipment: A building site digger approaches the whale carcass as clean up crews prepare to push it towards the nearby road to be taken away . Get ready to push: The digger closes in on the massive corpse . Reinforcements: It eventually takes two diggers to roll the dead creature up the beach to where it can be taken away . Oops: Workmen from the clean-up crewget ready to haul the whale carcass onto a flatbed truck, it appears that this photo was taken shortly after they ripped off its tail . To me... to you: The dead creature is winched on to the flatbed as a digger pushes from behind . Ready to go: The whale is finally loaded on to the truck and ready to be taken a way . Rest in peace... All loaded up on to its makeshift hearse, the whale is ready to be transported to its final resting place - the local landfill site . Mr Beecham, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, believes fishermen or an accident may have killed the animal. He added: 'Someone who saw it when it first washed up said it had a lot of line on it, perhaps from nets, so it could have been an entanglement or a combination of entanglement and a ship strike.' According to folklore, the explanation for the right whale's name is that they were the 'right' ones to hunt, because they float when killed and often swim within sight of the shore.","Southern right whale washed up on Sunset Beach after apparently being hit by a ship .

'Rodgers has received some scathing criticism for making seven changes but I am not going to join the chorus of disapproval.

"Scotland Yard Commissioner: Bernard Hogan-Howe has said burglary is at a 27-year low . Burglary victims reacted with fury yesterday after Britain’s most senior police officer claimed that families were safer in their homes than they had been for a generation. Scotland Yard commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said  burglary was at a 27-year low  and people should not ‘despair about crime’ because statistics showed it was falling. However, his comments were criticised by victims and campaigners last night, who said the crime continues to ‘wreck lives’. It also comes just a week after  the most senior judge in England and Wales defended the right of householders to protect themselves and their home from intruders. At a meeting with London Mayor Boris Johnson, Mr Hogan-Howe said: ‘Although people sometimes despair about crime, burglary is at a 27-year low right around the country. Burglary is going down. ‘People often don’t think they’re safe in their house; they’re actually more safe than they have ever been in a generation.’ A total of 245,317 house burglaries were recorded in 2011/12, compared with 519,265 in 1997, the crime survey of England and Wales reveals. In London, the overall burglary rate fell by 3.4 per cent, although some boroughs have seen increases of almost a third. Last night, burglary victim Jayne Chedgzoy challenged Mr Hogan-Howe to come to her home to see the lingering impact that burglars have had on her family. The 46-year-old said her life was . shattered when thieves broke into her house in Rotherham and stole . thousands of pounds saved for her disabled daughter, as well as her . wedding and engagement rings. ‘People might well say that burglary . is not a problem but that is nonsense,’ she said. ‘It’s very real to . people like me and he wants to come up around here. 'Traumatic': The charity Victim Support has said burglary remains a 'very real threat' ‘I lock all the doors and windows at . 8pm every night. It will never leave me. You’ve got to live with this . for the rest of your life.’ Last week, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord . Judge, became the latest  high-profile official to speak out on the . right of householders to defend their property after a Leicestershire . couple were arrested over the shooting of two intruders. ‘If your home is burgled and you’re in . there, you have the right to get rid of the burglar,’ Lord Judge said. ‘When you’re at home you want to feel safe, and in my opinion you’re . entitled to feel safe and secure.’ Javed Khan, of Victim Support, said: ‘We know that burglary remains a very real threat. ‘Having your home broken into is traumatic and can leave people feeling unsafe and anxious. ‘People can reduce the risk of  burglary by making sure their home is as secure as it can be.’ Mr Hogan-Howe added that he remains determined to catch burglars and that the numbers of those traced has improved dramatically. He said: 'I would never diminish someone having their house burgled. Numerically it is not a frequent offence but it is a very serious one which is why we always treat it seriously but we are seeing an improvement in burglary.'","Burglary in Britain is at a 27-year low, according to Scotland Yard Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe .

"This young elephant got more than he bargained for when he ambled up to a water hole to slake his thirst. Just moments after dipping his trunk in the water, it was grabbed by a hungry crocodile. But luckily for the elephant, the croc had bitten off considerably more than he could chew – and the astonished bull elephant was able to whip his trunk out of the reptile’s jaws with no more than a few cuts to remember the encounter by. The young elephant doesn't appear to see the waiting crocodile as he ambles over to the peaceful watering hole in the South Luangwa National park in Zambia . The remarkable scene was captured by amateur wildlife photographer Ian Salisbury, 62, at the South Luangwa National park in Zambia. Mr Salisbury, general manager of a safari lodge, said: ‘One of our guests had seen a crocodile try a similar attack on another elephant earlier in the day so, camera in hand, I went to see if there might be a repeat performance. ‘The action was so quick – a couple of . seconds – and fortunately I had the camera pointing in the right . direction. Having spent 30 years in the African bush, I realise how . lucky I was to catch the scene.’ SNAP! The crocodile grabs hold of the elephant's trunk, but it soon . becomes clear that he has bitten off a lot more than he can chew by grabbing the huge beast . The startled young elephant soon makes light work of escaping from the hungry crocodile's jaws, but by the startled look on it's face you can tell he had a shock . Mr Salisbury said the elephant ‘fled rapidly into the bush’ after the attack. The incident has remarkable echoes of Rudyard Kipling’s children’s story, The Elephant’s Child, which tells how the animals got their trunks after a crocodile grabbed a baby elephant’s nose and kept pulling it.

"A Missouri rancher has now found three of her cows mutilated in bizarre and unusual ways and after ruling out every explanation under the sun, she's prepared to look further into the heavens toward a culprit more outlandish: aliens. Lyn Mitchell of Henry County, Missouri says the first example occurred back in 2011. That cow had its tongue completely excised, along with one of its ears. She assumed teenagers were to blame. But after she found two more cows with mutilated genitals and missing organs on her farm just this summer, she now believes something harder to explain could be to blame and local police agree with her. Scroll down for video . Alien carnivores? Henry County, Missouri farmer Lyn Mitchell has now seen three of her cows bizarrely mutilated and is ready to believe aliens could be to blame . On July 9, Mitchell found one of her best cows dead in her field. She first noticed its tongue was missing, which was appalling enough. But she then realized the cow’s udders, anus, reproductive organs, and ears had all been removed. About two weeks later, it happened again. Though she hadn’t called a veterinarian to inspect the first two cows, she did get one in to see the third. Whodunnit? All three cows were female and had their tongues completely removed . ‘I’m normally a very private person,’ Mitchell told KSHB. ‘But I’m willing to do this because it’s just something I want some answers to.’ The vet’s findings only served to disturb Mitchell even more. Though he was unable to determine a cause of death, the vet told Mitchell that the cuts were extremely precise, almost surgically so. Grotesque: Pictured is the third mutilated cow. Its heart had been removed and left to hang outside its body . Mysterious: Beneath one of the cows was a mysterious char mark in a perfect outline of the mutilated animal . What’s more, despite the grievous injuries to the cows, no blood was found. Underneath the third cow, there was a mysteriously charred outline of the cow itself. It’s heart had also been cut from its body but left to hang outside the cow. ‘We couldn’t see any signs of trauma, and it doesn’t appear that there was any type of wild animal, such coyotes, that were involved,’ Robert Hills, Henry County Sheriff’s Chief Deputy, told KMOX. Faced with having found three of her cows, all female, all with their tongues removed, and two with missing reproductive organs dead on her farm, Mitchell is now searching for answers. Precision: The incisions used to cut the cows were surgically precise and did not bleed . Utterly disgusting: The two cows killed this July were found with mutilated genitals and missing udders . ‘The more it happens, the more questions you get. And the more you learn, you find more and more things that make you ask more questions,’ Mitchell said. Mitchell said some of those questions might have her looking toward the sky. ‘Something happened to these cows and it's not something that you see every day, it's not in your normal, so something else is going on,’ she said. And the local sheriff’s office isn’t ruling aliens out, either. ‘We’re having to look at this from two sides,’ said Hills. ‘Some people believe that there are aliens that are involved in this or the possibility of the occult going to the other end of the spectrum.’= . Open-minded: Mitchell says all the normal explanations have been debunked and is ready to believe aliens could be to blame.

"Maria Franziska, the last of seven brothers and sisters from the famous von Trapp family, has died . The last surviving member of the real von Trapp family that inspired The Sound of Music has died. Maria Franziska, one of seven brothers and sisters from the famous family, passed away in her sleep aged 99 at home in Vermont, America. Her family fled their home in Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938, before performing together around the U.S. Their story later inspired the 1965 musical hit, which won five Oscars and remains one of the most successful films ever made. Today, family friend Marianne Dorfer said she was 'surprised' that Maria had been the last of the family to survive. 'It was a surprise that she was the one in the family to live the longest because ever since she was a child she suffered from a weak heart,' she said. 'It was the fact that she suffered from this that her father decided to hire Maria von Trapp to teach her and her brothers and sisters. 'That, of course, then led to one of the most remarkable musical partnerships of the last century.' Maria, the second-eldest daughter of Baron von Trapp, was born in Zell am See, Salzburg, in 1914. Following the death of her father's first wife, she and her siblings were taught by aspiring nun Maria Kutschera, who quickly fell in love with Baron von Trapp and married him in 1927.

After an opera singer heard the children singing in a park, she entered them for a competition - with their subsequent success seeing them tour Europe and the United States as a family choir. For Baron von Trapp, who was a staunch Austrian patriot and opponent of Adolf Hitler, his singing family also provided the escape ticket from the Nazi regime.

"It has been nicknamed the 'Costa del Crime' because of the large number of expat British criminals who are thought to live there. And now the Costa del Sol, in southern Spain, is home to a new fugitive from the law after a large reptile - believed to be a crocodile - was spotted hiding out in the area. The seven-foot-long creature, dubbed the 'Costa Croc' is thought to be living by a lake near Marbella, just a stone's throw away from holiday homes owned by British residents. Scales: A 'arge reptile - thought to be a crocodile - is thought to be living in a lake near Marbella on the Costa del Sol (stock picture) Grave danger: Spanish police have put up signs around the lake in Mijas - warning tourists to beware of a crocodile on the loose in the area . Local authorities in the popular . holiday resort of Mijas have put up red warning signs in . Spanish saying: 'Grave Danger. Crocodile On The Loose.'

The area where it has been spotted, a . favourite walking and jogging spot next to a golf club used by hundreds . of British people, is fast becoming a tourist attraction. Dozens of expats and holidaymakers . are ignoring police warnings to walk to the lakes every day in the hope . of spotting the alligator. Despite putting up danger signs, . local authorities say they do not expect to catch the reptile until . temperatures rise and it has to start looking for food. Experts have calculated the creature is nearly . seven foot long and aged between 12 and 18 from footprints found by the . lake. They believe it is most likely an . alligator, which has a wider upper jaw than the typical crocodile.

"French spies plotted to assassinate Abu Hamza on a London street in the late 90s. The plan was to send him death threats claiming to be from a far-right organisation before shooting him . French spies were so fed up with Britain harbouring terrorists that they hatched a plot to assassinate Abu Hamza on a London street, it was claimed last night. Security officials were intending to kill the hook-handed cleric with a rifle while posing as members of the extremist group Combat 18. The far-Right organisation would then have been left to take the blame for his death. The French intelligence service, Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure (DGSE), also hatched a separate plot to kidnap Hamza from outside his west London home and bundle him on a ferry to France. They were concerned Algerian terrorists were planning an attack on the 1998 football World Cup and wanted to remove the hate preacher from circulation. His ranting sermons outside the Finsbury Park mosque in north London were considered an inspiration to Algerian fanatics. The capital became known as ‘Londonistan’ – with French officials concerned the UK police and security services were not doing enough to combat Islamist extremism. The claims are made by the HOPE not Hate anti-extremist think-tank and campaign group in a report on banned terror group al-Muhajiroun, which had strong ties to Hamza. The report’s author, Nick Lowles, writes: ‘One plot hatched by French intelligence that has, until now,  not previously come to light, was the idea of assassinating Abu Hamza in London. ‘The plan was to impersonate the British Nazi group Combat 18 and then allow them to take the blame. ‘In the immediate aftermath of the London nail-bombings, the French considered sending death threats in the style of C18 and then killing him with the same type of weaponry that the group was thought to possess. 'However, as with the kidnap plan, the assassination attempt was aborted and it is unclear how advanced the planning of either idea progressed.’ The French intelligence service also hatched a separate plot to kidnap Hamza from outside his west London home and bundle him on a ferry to France. On the kidnapping plot, in the build-up to the 1998 World Cup, Mr Lowles, a respected and long-standing campaigner, writes: ‘Angered by the inaction of Special Branch and MI5 in the UK, there was serious talk of [the French] taking matters into their own hands. 'He would be nabbed on the street, forced into the back of a van and then driven to Dover and snuck on to a French ferry. ‘It is also known that a team of assassins from Draco, a DGSE unit, was considering taking out senior terrorists.’ The report said al-Muhajiroun, co-founded by hate preacher Anjem Choudary – can be linked to jihad and terror attacks at home and abroad. Seventy people convicted of terrorism or terrorist-related offences in the UK, or who have died abroad over the past 14 years, have been linked to the organisation. The group has allegedly sent hundreds of British citizens to war zones across the globe, including 50 to 80 people fighting in Syria. Several hundred al-Muhajiroun volunteers have travelled to train or fight in Pakistan or Afghanistan. The group is also said to have encouraged supporters to go to Somalia and Yemen – with several rising to leading positions in Somali terror group al-Shabaab. Mr Lowles says he has identified links between the infamous ‘White Widow’ – Samantha Lewthwaite – and Anjem Choudary. Neither France’s Interior Ministry, nor the DGSE intelligence service, would comment on the alleged plan to kill Hamza, who is in a US jail awaiting trial on charges of running a terrorist training camp. He was extradited last year after a lengthy £1million legal battle.","French spies concerned radical cleric was inspiring Algerian terrorists .

"An Oregon man has been jailed for 30 days for collecting rainwater and snow runoff in three reservoirs that he had built on his own property. Gary Harrington, of Eagle Point, was found guilty two weeks ago for violating a 1925 law which says all water is publicly owned. Harrington, 64, was convicted of nine misdemeanors and received a $1,500 fine in addition to the jail term. Watershed moment: Gary Harrington, 64, was sentenced to 30 days in jail for building three rain collection ponds on his land in violation of a state law . Harrington surrendered himself to authorities to begin his prison term and said that he was sacrificing himself to stand up for liberty, according to AOL Real Estate. ‘When it comes to the point where a rural landowner can't catch rainwater that falls on his land to protect his property, it's gone too far,’ he told the Associated Press following his conviction. Decades earlier, Harrington constructed two dams measuring at 10 and 20 feet, and has since  collected nearly 13million gallons of water in his man-made ponds, which is enough to fill 20 Olympic-sized pools. He also built boat docks and stocked the reservoirs with trout and Bluegill for recreational fishing. Filled up: Over the years, the reservoirs have collected nearly 13million gallons of water . Water world: Harrington erected two dams on his property measuring at 10 and 20 feet . Gone fishing: Harrington built boat docks and stocked his ponds with trout and Bluegil . Oregon's Water Resources Department said that while it is legal to set up rainwater collection barrels on roofs or other surfaces, Harrington's reservoirs went far beyond that and required permits. ‘Mr Harrington has operated these three reservoirs in flagrant violation of Oregon law for more than a decade,’ the department's deputy director, Tom Paul, told the Medford Mail Tribune. The state initially approved permits for Harrington's water collection pools on his 170-acre property in 2003, but ultimately reversed its decision. ‘They issued me my permits. I had my permits in hand and they retracted them just arbitrarily, basically,’ Harrington told CNSNews.com. ‘They took them back and said, 'No, you can't have them.' So I've been fighting it ever since.’ 'Don't tread on me': Harrington said the government has bullied him and trampled on his individual rights as a property owner using the 1925 state law as an excuse . Tug-'o-war: The state has ordered the Eagle Point man to drain his ponds, but he vows to continue the fight . Water battle: Harrington has claimed that he has been collecting rainwater for his personal use and for fire suppression . Harrington has been ordered to drain his three reservoirs, but the Eagle Point resident remains defiant and ready to continue the fight. He said that he is only collecting rainwater for personal use and fire suppression, and that the state is infringing upon his rights. ‘The government is bullying,' he told CNSNews.com. ‘They've just gotten to be big bullies and if you just lay over and die and give up, that just makes them bigger bullies. ‘So, we as Americans, we need to stand on our constitutional rights, on our rights as citizens and hang tough. This is a good country, we’ll prevail.’ His legal adviser said they are willing to fight the issue all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court according to KDRV.","Gary Harrington, 64, was found guilty for building three man-made ponds containing nearly 13million gallons of water .

A 28-year-old woman has been arrested for stabbing a woman in the cheek with a stiletto heel during an argument over a man they had both dated. Julia Bol allegedly punctured 41-year-old Rebecca Boss' left cheek as they stood on a Nebraska sidewalk about 3am yesterday following a baby shower. The pair were arguing before Bol reportedly grabbed one of Boss’ shoes, which she was holding in her hands, and 'stabbed her in the face with it'.

"A pistol belonging to infamous Wild West outlaw Jesse James is tipped to sell for over $1.6million (£1million) 130 years after his assassination. The Colt .45 revolver was a favourite of the notorious gunslinger who spent more than 20 years terrorising the America's Mid West with his gang of bandits in the mid 19th century. Experts have described his gun as one of the most significant ever to appear at auction. For sale: The Colt .45 pistol once owned by the notorious outlaw Jesse James is expected to fetch over $1.6million (£1million) when it is put up for auction later this month . Legend of the West: A young Jesse James, armed with three revolvers, poses of a picture in the late 1800s . James became a folk hero in his home . state of Missouri after waging a guerrilla campaign against Unionists . during the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865. Following the war James became one of the most iconic characters of his era, gaining celebrity status by holding up banks, stagecoaches and trains. James was shot and killed in 1882 by Bob Ford, a member of his gang who had been secretly hired as a hitman by the state governor Thomas Crittenden. Following James' death aged 34 the Colt passed to his son Jesse James Junior who made it into a display which he would charge members of the public to see. In 1923 Jesse Jnr gave it to a doctor as a bond after he was hurt in a car crash and it ended up in the hands of Harry Hawes, a Missouri state senator. Historical: Experts have described the gun as one of the most significant ever to appear at auction . Detail from the pistol shows it was made in 1871 five years before the James' gang disastrous raid on the First National Bank of Northfield, Minnesota . The gun has emerged for sale 130 years after the legendary outlaw was assassinated by a member of his own gang . Frank Boykin, a congressman, owned the gun until 1975 when he sold it to a US collector. Bidding will start at $400,000 (£250,000) for it but experts have tipped the gun to sell for a seven-figure sum. It comes with documentation proving its provenance, including letters from three generations of the James family confirming its history. Tom Slater, Americana expert at Heritage Auctions, said: 'Jesse James is the ultimate Western outlaw and this gun is the holy grail for collectors. 'He often took guns from the people he robbed so there's every chance this gun didn't start out life as his. Memorabilia: A display of weapons and other items including the Colt .45, that were used by the James Gang. The picture is signed by Jesse James Jr who inherited the gun after his father's death in 1882 . 'The story behind this gun is almost as fascinating as the gun itself. 'It was first documented in a 1923 display of Jesse James' guns which was put together by his son Jesse Jnr. 'Jesse Jnr carried the display around on the back seat of his car and charged people a quarter to see it. 'The following year Jesse Jnr was in a serious car accident and suffered injuries that required ongoing medical treatment. 'He couldn't afford the bills and so he turned over two guns to the doctor as security. 'The bill was never paid so the doctor kept the guns. 'Jesse Jnr's family tried to get the guns back but the doctor wouldn't cooperate so the family brought a lawsuit against him. Vice President John Nance Garner points two revolvers, including the Jesse James gun, at Harry Truman in 1938.  Both Truman and the guns' owner Harry B. Hawes were Missouri senators at the time . 'Before the suit came about the doctor died and the guns disappeared. 'They surfaced several years later in the hands of Harry Hawes, a senator from Missouri. 'From him they passed to congressman Frank Boykin who owned them until 1975 when his son sold them to a collector. 'Ever since Jesse Jnr gave the gun to the doctor the James family have been trying to get it back and there is a folder of correspondence from them to back it up. 'This sort of provenance with a gun like this is unheard of, and that makes it a very special gun indeed. 'Put simply, it is one of the most important firearms ever to appear at auction. 'We have set an opening bid of £250,000 but we have no idea where it will go from there. 'Bidding could easily go into the millions.' The auction will take place in Los Angeles on November 24. A wedding portrait of legendary outlaw Jesse James taken before his marriage in 1874 . He Is a wild west legend and one of the most famous American outlaws of all time. Jesse James rose to notoriety during the American civil war when he and his brother Frank led a Confederate guerrilla force against the Union in their home state of Missouri. After the war they fell into a life of crime robbing banks, stagecoaches and trains as they riding in different gangs. Jesse's fate was sealed following a disastrous bank robbery in Northfield, Minnesota, when many gang members were captured or wounded. They had chosen the Minnesota town because it was small and thought to be peaceable but most importantly there was only one bank and recent newspaper stories had reported that a new safe and time lock and two heavy doors for the vault had just been added to First National’s building. This didn’t put the gang off. They reasoned the threat of a gun would be enough to persuade most men to unlock a vault. It just meant that all the money in town was in one place and if there was enough of it to make it worth investing in a such security there was enough to make it worth robbing. According to a detailed account of James' life by the historian Mark Lee Gardner, the day they rode into Northfield, September 7, 1876, they were ‘at the top of their game. But the bank staff resisted. Frustrated, Frank James fired shots above bookkeeper Joseph Heywood’s head. In the smoke and confusion a colleague though he had been shot and made a run for it,bringing more shots from the robber. Everything began to unravel. The town was alerted to the raid taking place. All their money was held in that building – all uninsured. They decided to fight. The gun battle lasted less than ten minutes – panicked the gang members who had been keeping watched dashed to and fro amid bullets and rocks that arced through the air as locals fought with anything to hand. Inside all was confusion and violence. Mr Gardner states, ‘While the townspeople were shooting to kill, the outlaws’ shots were really meant to frighten, to scare away, to buy time – at least in the beginning.’ Keeping watch outside, panic growing Cole Younger signalled the retreat: ‘For God’s sake,’ he shouted. ‘Come out. They are shooting us all to pieces.’ When it was over robbers Clell Miller and Bill Chadwell lay dead in the street. Bookkeeper Joseph Heywood had a bullet in his head and another local had been killed in the frenzy outside.  The gang’s haul totalled just $26.60 ‘in coin and crip.’ Bob Coles had been hit. They left, six men on five horses and for the next 14 days evaded capture in what became the largest manhunt in US history. With a large bounty on his head, Jesse James was eventually shot and killed by Robert Ford, a member of his own gang . More than 1000 men chased them across marsh and woodland. Cole Younger later recalled: ‘We suffered in those fourteen days a hundred deaths.’ Jesse managed to slip away and live in St Jo under a false name, unaware there was a $10,000 bounty on his head. But one morning, as the 34-year-old Jesse climbed on a chair to straighten a picture, he was shot in the back of the head by gang member Robert Ford. Ford cut James down as he stood to adjust a picture in the parlour of his home. James was parnoid after a life on the run and had invited Ford and his brother Charles to live with him and his wife Zee and protect them. 'Meet me in Kansas City tonight or tomorrow. I have my man,' Jesse James assassin Robert Ford's telegram to Governor Crittenden. Instead the man who had survived shooting battles and daring raids, died as he had lived; by the bullet and for bounty. While his wife wept by her dying husband’s side Bob and Charley Ford, Mr Gardner writes: ‘Quickly grabbed their hats and also Jesse’s revolvers and gun belt and hurried off for the town’s only telegraph office. ‘Once there, Charley paced nervously…as Bob tried several times to write out a telegram.’ When he finally handed a piece of paper to the operator it read as follows: ‘Meet me in Kansas City tonight or tomorrow. I have my man.' The telegram was addressed to Thomas Crittenden, Governor of Missouri who had placed a $10,000 reward on Jesse, dead - $40,000 if he was taken alive but no-one really believed Jesse James would be taken alive. ‘If you hear they’ve captured me alive,’ he once said to a cousin. ‘Say it’s a lie; they may kill me, but they will never get me otherwise.’ That they captured him at all was an event that, according to Mr Gardner, had its beginnings in the chaos of Northfield, Minnesota and the raid on the town’s First National Bank.","The six shooter was a favourite of the notorious gunslinger .

"Listening to Mozart can significantly help to focus the mind and improve brain performance, according to new research. A study found that listening to a minuet - a specific style of classical dance music - composed by Mozart increased the ability of both young and elderly people to concentrate and complete a task. Scientists say that the findings help to prove that music plays a crucial role in human brain development. Are headphoneS the ultimate study aid? Japanese and American scientists have discovered that Mozart's harmonious melodies help to focus the mind and prevent distraction when carrying out a task . ‘Music evolved for helping to overcome . the predicament of stress that arises from holding contradictory . cognitions so that knowledge . is not discarded but rather can be accumulated, and human culture can . evolve,' wrote Professor Nobuo Masataka of Japan’s Kyoto University and Dr Leonard Perlovsky of Harvard University, who led the research. Researchers took 25 boys, aged between eight and nine as well as 25 older people aged between ages 65 to 75, and made them complete a version of a Stroop task. The Stroop task is a famous test used to investigate a person's mental performance and involves asking the participant to identify the colour of words. The challenge is managing to identify the correct colour when the word spells out a different colour. Many have described the benefits that the composer's music has on the brain as the 'Mozart Effect' As the series of words flash before the participants on a computer screen, they must identify each colour and ignore the word that the letters spell out. For example, the word ‘red’ could be written in the colour blue but the participant must say the word 'red'. The test was carried out three times. Once while a Mozart minuet played in the background, once with a modified version of the same music with dissonant (irregular and unpleasant) intervals, and a third time in complete silence. The findings were consistent for both the younger and older participants. Both age groups were able to identify the correct colours quicker and with less errors when listening to the original Mozart music. When dissonant music played, reaction times became significantly slower and there was a much higher rate or mistakes. Scientists said that the brain’s natural dislike of dissonant music and the high success rate of  the flowing, consonant (harmonious) music of Mozart indicate the important effect of music on cognitive function. It also showed that consonant music could help come people ignore distractions, they added. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's is universally described as complex, melodically beautiful and rich in harmony and texture. The Austrian composer, keyboard player, violinist, violist, and conductor died at the age of 35, and left behind more than 600 pieces. Previous studies have found that his compositions provide cognitive benefits and scientists have referred to this as the 'Mozart Effect'.","Scientists have discovered that listening to Mozart is better than listening to less flowing music or silence when trying to focus on a task .

"Almost a third (31 per cent) of 18-25 year-olds have had a sexual encounter with someone they met through an app or social networking site . A new survey has revealed shocking statistics that show the damage so-called hook-up apps may be having on the sex lives of young Brits. Apps like Tinder and Grindr are geo-social networking applications supposedly geared towards finding a lover or relationship. But many users reveal they have the apps - and traditional social networking sites like Facebook - just to  find instant sex partners. Almost a third (31 per cent) of 18-25 year-old's who responded to the questionnaire admitted having a sexual encounter with someone they met through an app or social networking site. On average, a young person who used one of these apps had three of these encounters. The most unrestrained admitted having up to 80 sexual partners this way. Londoners are the most promiscuous; nearly 40 per cent of young people living in the capital admitted to the having sex with someone they met on social media. Scots are the most reserved, with less than half as many young adults (17 per cent) opting 'yes' when it comes to having a hook-up north of the border. But while young people are finding it a lot easier to access sexual partners, it appears to be making them worse in bed. Respondents were asked to rate their experience between the sheets, and compare it against sex with a frequent partner. The hook-up partner scored lower across the board on duration, excitement, comfort and overall satisfaction. And the decline in quality has resulted in almost half (47 per cent) of 18-25 year old females admitting that they fake orgasms. Conversely, one in four 40-50 year olds, who have grown up without the instant sex apps, boasted that they were able to experiment with their partner more than when they were younger and their sex has got better as they've got older. A spokesperson for intimate toy retailer Bondara, who commissioned the research, said: 'From UK festivals to far-flung foreign lands, it is now possible to arrange an illicit liaison through a smartphone. 'However, while hookup apps such as Tindr, Grindr, Bendr and 3ndr are increasing the quantity of sexual experiences, the quality is suffering. For many people there are huge benefits to fleeting, no-strings-attached encounters - but great sex is seldom one of them. 'If you are looking for the most pleasurable experience possible, you should put down the phone, pick up some roses, and ask that friend or colleague you fancy for a traditional date.'

"A juvenile humpback whale was seen frolicking just kilometres from the Sydney Harbour entrance, to the awe of lucky onlookers on Thursday. About 70 whale watchers mostly on board boats were lucky enough to see the animal breaching in spectacular style as it launched itself out of the ocean before crashing on its back and sending water flying. A nearby boat was almost within touching distance of the animal as it put on a cresting display. Throughout the afternoon, the young whale set its course straight for Sydney Harbour, before heading to the Manly Wharf area. Scroll down for video . On lookers on board a boat were in for a treat when they got just metres from a young humpback whale, spotted off Sydney Harbour on Thursday . Whale of a time: The whale made the Sydney coast its playground, seen breaching through the sea and enjoying the warmer waters . Jonas Liebschner from Whale Watching Sydney it was not unusual to the inquisitive creatures to investigate the area. 'Whales do sometimes come into Sydney Harbour and have a little bit of a look around,' he said. Thursday's whale sighting is the third in the Sydney area in less than a week. On Saturday, up to 10 humpback whales were spotted off Bondi Beach and near Botany Bay, marking the start of the harbour city's whale-watching season. Two humpbacks were seen playing with a pod of dolphins off Bondi Beach on Saturday morning, followed by another five seen around the same area later that afternoon. Crash: The juvenile was seen cresting, and as it smashed back through the sea's surface, it sent a spray of water flying through the air . More than 20,000 humpbacks are expected to pass Sydney as they head north to warmer waters off the Queensland coast . Another four were spotted near Botany Bay, in Sydney's south east. Mr Liebschner previously said the large number of animals sighted was extraordinary, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. '(It) is a phenomenal number for this early in the season,' he said. More of the creatures are expected to pass the city throughout the season and Mr Liebschner said whale numbers had steadily increased by about 10 per cent in the last five to six years. As part of their migration, about 20,000 whales will travel north past Sydney as they make their way to sub-tropical breeding grounds off the Queensland coast. On their way back, this number is expect to be about 22,000 whales, with the addition of 2,000 newborn calves, Mr Liebschner said. The sightings have coincided with the above average warm weather. For those hoping to catch a glimpse of a humpback or many of the other species of whale, the mammals will complete the 5,000km trip along Australia's east coast from Antarctic waters - one of the longest in the animal kingdom - in the coming months.

"Fresh questions over the authenticity of the 'Gospel of Jesus's Wife' papyrus have been raised after a text from the same collection written in the same handwriting was proved to be a fake, experts say. Written in ancient Coptic, the Gospel of Jesus' Wife seemingly indicates Jesus was married as it reads: 'Jesus said to them, ""My wife""' and '…she will be able to be my disciple…' Since then, historians and religious leaders have attempted to both prove and deny the artefact's credibility. Last month, carbon testing on the papyrus seemed to suggest it was written between the fourth and eighth centuries and was therefore authentic. However, experts say another fragment from the same collection as the 'Jesus's wife' papyrus is a fake - casting doubts on the legitimacy of the latter. The discovery of a scrap of papyrus in 2012 (pictured) that claimed Jesus had a wife  caused a holy row of words over its authenticity . The forgery - a fragment of the canonical . Gospel of John - is also written in the same handwriting, with the same . writing instrument and ink - which for some proves once and for all the . Jesus's wife piece is fake. Writing in a blog for CNN, . Joel S. Baden - an associate professor of Old Testament at Yale . Divinity School - and Candida Moss - a professor of New Testament and . early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame - said: 'It’s never a . good sign for a text of doubtful authenticity to be found in the . company of a sure forgery. 'More . directly: Multiple experts agree that the fragment of John and the . Jesus’ wife papyrus are written in the same hand, using the same ink and . even the same writing instrument. 'Simply put: If one is a forgery, they’re both forgeries.' Christian . Askeland, a Coptic specialist and assistant research professor at . Indiana Wesleyan University told Charlotte Allen of the Weekly Standard: . 'The fragment [of John] contains exactly the same hand, exactly the . same ink and has been written with the same writing instrument [as the . “Jesus’ wife” fragment]. The online version of Gospel of St John, page 7 (left) compared to the Coptic John fragment (right). The red lines indicate how much was lifted from the online source . Same handwriting? Experts claim the 'Gospel of Jesus's Wife' (left) and the Gospel of John (right) were written 'in exactly the same hand, exactly the same ink and has been written with the same writing instrument . 'One . would assume that it were part of the same writing event, be it modern . or ancient. In some sense, this is not a surprise, as the Ink Results . indicated that the ink was very similar.' Debate over the fragment's authenticity is set to continue as some will no doubt question these latest findings. The artefact was first shown to the world around 18 months ago by respected Harvard Divinity School, professor Karen King. The collection of documents, which were given to Professor King anonymously, immediately caused a stir, with some using it to prove Jesus was married instead of celibate - a view which could undermine some of the Church's main teachings. The . papyrus’ back side, or verso, is so badly damaged that only a few key . words - 'my mother' and 'three'- were decipherable, but on the front . side, or recto, Professor King gleaned eight fragmentary lines: . At the time, a furious Vatican newspaper dismissed the find as a fake. One editor, Giovanni Maria Vian, wrote a stinging piece entitled 'At any rate, a fake.' Other holes in its authenticity were also reported. Some claimed that - for a small scrap the size of a business card - the fragment seemed to contain a lot of important information. As well as suggesting Jesus had a wife, it also described someone called Mary as 'worthy' and capable of being a disciple. The handwriting was also deemed to be untidy, while some drew comparisons between the document and another Coptic Christian text, called the 'Gospel of Thomas.' At the time, New Testament expert Professor Francis . Watson of Durham University said that the fragment was a collage of texts . from Thomas which had been copied and reassembled out of order in bad . ancient Coptic. However, the scrap did have faint traces of ink which had been worn away - perhaps suggesting it was a true document. Also, some experts highlighted text used in ancient papyruses if often reproduced from other sources. The piece was finally submitted for carbon testing last month. There, scientists proved the papyrus itself and the ink were genuine. Ancient: The back side, or verso, of the papyrus. New evidence suggests this document is a fake as another papyrus in the collection - which is written in the same handwriting - has been proved to be a forgery . The papyrus was examined by . electrical engineering, chemistry and biology experts from Columbia . University, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of . Technology (MIT) who declared the parchment was indeed several . hundred years old. The study, published in the Harvard . Theological Review, revealed the document was found to date to eighth . century Egypt, around 400 years later than Professor King originally . thought. Critics . have said that the fragment is a collage of pieces of the Gospel of . Thomas by someone with a dubious grasp of ancient Coptic. One . scholar even claims to have found a typo in an online edition of the . gospel, which matches one in what they say is a forgery. Other experts have claimed that ink pooling suggests that the document was created in modern times. Leo Depuydt, an Egyptologist at Brown University, said that none of the new tests have convinced him that the papyrus is a fake. He . wrote in the Harvard Theological Review that a forger may have ‘wanted . to put his or her own spin on modern theological issues’ such as . celibacy and the role of women in the Church. ‘As . a forgery, it is bad to the point of being farcical or fobbish. . . . I . don’t buy the argument that this is sophisticated. I think it could be . done in an afternoon by an undergraduate student,’ he said. The . provenance of the papyrus has also been questioned. The owner of the . document has asked to remain anonymous but said that he acquired the . artefact along with five other papyri in 1999 from a collector who got . them in the 1960s in East Germany. Additional tests showed that the ink’s . chemical composition is consistent with other inks used by the ancient . Egyptians, while microscopic imaging found no suspicious ink pooling . that critics of the papyrus said was evidence of the ink being applied . in more recent times. At the same time, other papyri from the collection were tested for means of comparison. One of those was a fragment from the canonical Gospel' of John written in a rare ancient dialect of Coptic known as Lycopolitan. A Lycopolitan version of John, which was first published in 1924, is now available online. Cross comparisons show the online John text was very similar to the 'ancient' papyrus, CNN reports. Furthermore, carbon dating of the John fragment suggests it was from the seventh to ninth centuries. The Lycopolitan dialect died out as a language sometime before the sixth century - a great deal of time before the papyrus was written. Experts are now saying this is evidence that the whole collection is a fake. Professor King has previously said the document does not necessarily prove Jesus had a wife - but questions Christian ideas of women, marriage and celibacy. She said previsouly: . ‘I’m basically hoping that we can move past the issue of forgery to . questions about the significance of this fragment for the history of . Christianity, for thinking about questions like, “Why does Jesus being . married, or not, even matter?” Why is it that people had such an . incredible reaction to this?’ Professor King originally interpreted the document as a debate about celibacy. ‘Now . when I come back and read the fragment, it seems the major issue being . talked about was that Jesus was affirming that wives and mothers can be . his disciples,’ she said in an interview earlier this week. Professor Karen King - whose discovery of the papyrus caused controversy back in 2012 . At the time the papyrus was announced, Professor King told Smithsonian Magazine that the fragment casts doubt 'on the whole Catholic claim of a celibate priesthood based on Jesus’ celibacy.' She . said: 'What this shows is that there were early Christians for whom ... sexual union in marriage could be an imitation of God’s creativity and . it could be spiritually proper and appropriate.' Professor . King speculated that the so-called 'Gospel of Jesus’ Wife' may have . been thrown out 'because the ideas it contained flowed so strongly . against the ascetic currents of the tides in which Christian practices . and understandings of marriage and sexual intercourse were surging.' This . representation of Jesus as a man with earthly passions and needs has . not survived in the doctrines of the established churches, which . emphasise celibacy and asceticism as a spiritual ideal. Many people over the centuries have tried to work out a 'bloodline' for possible descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Many historians agree that there is no historical, biblical, archaeological or genetic evidence to support the idea. But the fragment of papyrus that is said to be a translation of a lost gospel has Jesus referring to 'my wife' A 13th century Cistercian monk and historian Peter of Vaux de Cernay claimed that Jesus had a relationship with Mary Magdalene. Early . Mormon leaders stated that Jesus as polygamous based upon an obscure . passage attributed to a second century Greek philosopher called Celsus. In . the 19th century, a politician called Louis Martin published a . 'history' book that claimed Jesus was married to Mary and that they both . travelled to the South of France where they had a son. Subsequent . books have claimed Jesus fathered a child with Mary - or possibly had . more offspring with a Kashmiri woman. Author Andreas Faber-Kaiser . interviewed one person who claimed to be a Kashmiri descendant of Jesus. Mary . Magdalene has also been said to be the mother of Saint Sarah, while . another author claims Jesus and Mary are the ancestors of all the . European royal families.","'Fragment from same collection as Gospel of Jesus's Wife is fake' - experts .

"Gallstones patient Mark Hemmings (pictured) made a desperate 999 call for an ambulance - but his request was refused, an inquest heard. A 999 call handler advised a gallstones patient to call back if he fell unconscious as she refused to send him an ambulance - days before he died in agony, an inquest heard. Mark Hemmings died just 30 minutes after he eventually arrived at hospital - three days after he first called for an ambulance from his home in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent. The 41-year-old had been struck with the painful gallstones - which could have been cured with a routine operation. But despite his increasingly desperate pleas on March 29 last year, Good Friday, his requests for an ambulance were refused by a 999 call handler before his case was referred to an out-of-hours GP. An inquest in to his death heard harrowing recordings of Mr Hemmings' phone conversations with both the 999 call handler and the GP urgent care unit. During a seven-and-a-half minute call, Mr Hemmings begs the 999 operator three times to send an ambulance - but is refused each time. At one stage the dispatcher told him to call back if he fell unconscious or his condition deteriorated and advised him to take a warm bath. Mr Hemmings can be heard asking whether he needs to go to hospital, before operator Heidi Nicholls says: 'No, you need to stay on the phone for a moment. 'You could try a warm bath, hot water bottle in the painful area but if you collapse, become unconscious, unresponsive, faint, or become pale, cold or clammy it's 999.' Earlier in the conversation, she said: 'From what you've told me you don't require an emergency ambulance but we will get somebody to call you back.' Mr Hemmings replied: 'Can't I have an ambulance - I'm in agony.' Mr Hemming received no medical treatment over the Easter weekend until his carer eventually found him in agony on the floor of his home on April 1, and raised the alarm. On this occasion, an ambulance did attend and took Mr Hemmings to University Hospital of North Staffordshire where he was diagnosed with pancreatitis. But minutes after he arrived Mr Hemmings died. A post mortem revealed his gallstones had blocked his pancreatic duct and triggered a fatal heart attack. Scroll down for video . Mr Hemmings was finally rushed to University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured) on April 1 last year - but by that time his gallstones had caused fatal pancreatitis . An inquest heard Mr Hemmings was unable to drive and spent his final two days in agony as his organs slowly failed. During the hearing at North Staffordshire Coroner's Court a specialist from the University Hospital of North Staffordshire said that if he had been taken to hospital sooner he would probably have survived. Consultant Damien Durkin criticised a series of computerised questions used by ambulance controllers to decide if callers need help and out-of-hours doctors who failed to 'ring alarm bells'. He said: 'Six out of 10 people in intensive care with severe pain from this condition come through it - and it is nine out of 10 for those with less severe pain. 'The algorithm failed to benefit Mark. 'It is biased towards heart problems and less towards abdominal pain.' Paramedics eventually arrived at his home but Mr Hemming went into cardiac arrest. Despite working to restart his heart throughout the six mile journey to hospital he was pronounced dead minutes after arriving. Call handler Miss Nicholls said the questions she was told to ask Mr Hemmings by a computerised algorithm system ruled he did not need an emergency ambulance. She added: 'We cannot override this and although there are paramedics in the control room for us to ask, I would not think the system would come up with the wrong answer.' After his first call Mr Hemmings was advised to take a warm bath to ease the pain and the case was passed on to an out-of-hours GP, the inquest heard. He waited 90-minutes before Dr Sri Sukhavasi called him back, and told the medic he was in excruciating pain and about to pass out. But during the three-and-a-half minute conversation, the doctor refused to attend his home and instead told Mr Hemmings - who lived alone and could not drive - to come to the surgery himself. Mr Hemmings died shortly after being rushed to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured) The inquest heard a harrowing recording of Mr Hemmings' call to West Midlands Ambulance Service which took place at 11.09pm on Friday, March 29 last year. He starts off the call by asking for an ambulance before giving his address. Mr Hemmings: 'My stomach's in agony, duck, I've got lumps in my stomach, I'm in agony duck.' Miss Nicholls: 'Ok have you got any other symptoms.' Mr Hemmings: 'No duck, just seating a lot. Weak, really weak.' Miss Nicholls: 'How long has this been going on for?' Mr Hemmings: 'Mostly all day duck, a few hours.' Miss Nicholls: 'OK, put your hand on your tummy or your chest and tell me if it feels a normal temperature. If it feels warm? 'Have you had any diarrhoea or vomiting?' Mr Hemmings: 'Yeah, I've been sick a few times.' Miss Nicholls: 'Have you had diarrhoea?' Mr Hemmings: 'No.' Miss Nicholls: 'Have you brought up any blood?' Mr Hemmings: 'No. I've got gallstones in my stomach duck.' Miss Nicholls: 'Have you got any crushing or severe aching pain in your chest, upper back or upper abdomen?' Mr Hemmings: 'No duck, I've got just pain in my stomach.' Miss Nicholls: 'Is it below your belly button or above your belly button?' Mr Hemmings: 'Above.' Miss Nicholls: 'Have you got any crushing or severe aching pain in your uper abdomen?' Mr Hemmings: 'Sort of yeah.' Miss Nicholls: 'What do you mean by sort of when you say ""sort of""?' (Inaudible) Miss Nicholls: 'Is it a stabbing pain rather than a crushing or severe aching?' Mr Hemmings: 'More like stabbing pain. Can I have an ambulance?' Miss Nicholls: 'Have you passed a bowel motion that looks black and tarry or red or maroon.' Mr Hemmings: 'No.' Miss Nicholls: 'And have you suddenly become confused or more confused than usual?' (inaudible) You're going dizzy and that yeah? Mr Hemmings: 'Yeah.' Miss Nicholls: 'Now Mark, from what you've told me, you don't require an emergency ambulance bit what we are going to do is we're going to get somebody to call you back, ok?' Mr Hemmings: 'Can I have an ambulance?' Miss Nicholls: 'From the answers you don't need an ambulance ok?' Mr Hemmings: 'I'm in agony duck.' Miss Nicholls: 'OK, I appreciate that, but from the answers you give me you don't require an ambulance. What you do need to do is to speak to the local GP within the next two hours ok?' Mr Hemmings: 'Do I need to go to the hospital?' Miss Nicholls: 'No, you need to stay on the phone for a moment ok. Paracetemol can help with your tummy pain, follow the instructions on the pack, any doubt ask the pharmacist. Don't use ibuprofen or any anti-inflammatory such as aspirin as these can make your stomach worse. 'Stomach ache is very common, not often serious and gets better on its own, but you can try a warm bath, hot water bottle on the painful area - but if you collapse, become unconscious, unresponsive, faint or become pale, cold or clammy, it's 999.' When Mr Hemmings, who suffered mental and physical problems, failed to turn up for the appointment his records were marked 'did not attend' and no further checks were made on his condition. The inquest heard the tragedy happened over the same weekend the GP out-of-hours service was passed from North Staffordshire Urgent Care (NSUC) to a new provider based in the north of England. Dr Sukhavasi told the hearing: 'I had no doubt he needed to be seen straight away but I thought it would be more effective for him to come in to the base. 'I did not offer to visit because we had an enormous amount of work that night and it is better to examine patients in a clinical setting than people's homes. 'I did not call an ambulance because I knew he had already been told one was not necessary. 'In hindsight when he said he was in pain I should have explored further what was causing it.' The inquest heard he was left in agony over the weekend and was not found until his carer Yasir Mohammed found him passed out on the floor of his home on the Monday morning. Mr Mohammed, from the Brighter Futures mental health charity, dialled 999 again and this time a response car and ambulance were sent. West Midlands Ambulance Trust medical director Dr Andrew Carson said six of Britain's 11 services had the algorithm system which had been used on millions of people. He said: 'Its conclusion to have the case assessed by a GP within two hours was correct and we trust that the other organisation will deal with it.' Reserving his verdict until November 14, Coroner for Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire Ian Smith said: 'He fell through gaps in the system because he was not pushy enough.'

"Friends and allies of Baroness Thatcher expressed 'surprise and disappointment' last night as it emerged President Obama is not planning to send any serving member of his administration to her funeral. Whitehall sources have revealed that the US delegation at tomorrow's service in St Paul's Cathedral will be led by two Reagan era secretaries of state: James Baker and George Shultz. Though President Obama himself had not been expected to attend, there had been speculation that he would be represented either by Vice President Joe Biden or wife Michelle. However, the Obama administration had said it would not be attending Thatcher's funeral before the Boston bombings . Scroll down for video . Speaking at a press conference in the White House following the explosions at Boston Marathon - he said he would not be going to Thatcher's funeral before yesterday's explosions . The Queen's decision to attend Lady . Thatcher's funeral has effectively elevated it to a state occasion . unprecedented for a political figure in Britain since the death of Sir . Winston Churchill in 1965. Other world leaders, including . Canada's Stephen Harper, Mario Monti of Italy and Polish Prime Minister . Donald Tusk, are attending the service in person. A key Reagan-era ally of Baroness Thatcher, former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, will attend . President Obama paid tribute to Lady Thatcher's towering achievements when her death was announced last week. But a US embassy spokesman confirmed . that no serving member of his administration would be present to pay . their last respects, citing a busy week in US domestic politics. Former US vice president Dick Cheney and ex-secretary of . state Henry Kissinger will attend the funeral, Downing . Street said today. Former defence secretary Dr Liam Fox, . Lady Thatcher's closest ally in modern-day politics, said: 'I think it . would be both surprising and disappointing if after President Obama's . fulsome tribute to Lady Thatcher, the American administration did not . send a senior serving member to represent them.' Sir Gerald Howarth, chairman of the . Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group of MPs and peers, said: 'The . bonds forged between the UK and the US through Ronald Reagan and . Margaret Thatcher was instrumental in ending the Cold War and liberating . millions of people. 'That the present administration feels . unable to be represented as the world marks the extraordinary . contribution Margaret Thatcher made will be a source of disappointment . to those who served with her in that great endeavour.' The US embassy insisted no snub was intended, but confirmed that Mr Baker and Mr Schulz would represent the US. 'This is a hugely significant week in terms of US domestic politics,' a spokesman added. He said that both the First Lady and . the Vice President were 'the President's point people on gun control', . adding: 'This is a week when there is a lot of movement on Capitol Hill . on gun control issues.' Last night police in London were under pressure to crack down on plans to insult the memory of Lady Thatcher at the funeral. Hundreds of protesters have pledged to turn their backs as her coffin travels through Central London. Campaigners said Scotland Yard had . effectively encouraged the move by decreeing it is not against the law . and will not provoke arrests. The insult is calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to her grieving family without provoking action by police. It will be seen by millions worldwide as the occasion is beamed live around the world on TV.

Police chiefs said they are 'not there . to uphold respect' and said demonstrators who are merely 'insulting' are unlikely to face arrest. But they faced a backlash from many who . questioned why anyone would want to be so disrespectful to the dead . stateswoman. Hundreds have signed up to online sites vowing to wear red and turn their back on the military funeral cortege. They want to occupy high- profile points of Lady Thatcher's three-mile funeral procession so their views will not be missed. John Cooper QC, the architect behind . the back-turning protest, said the public nature of the funeral means it . is impossible to ban insulting gestures. He said: 'Simply saying it is beastly, . horrible or distasteful – a point of view that I can understand – does . not take away the fact there will be a proportion of society that . rightly wants to legally demonstrate.' Retired chief constable Dr Tim Brain . said police are forced to tread the line between the right to protest . and upholding the law. He said on BBC Radio 4 that police . will be 'very firm' if protest becomes disruption, for example if . objects are thrown at the funeral procession. Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit . described protesters as 'mindless bigots' but said police cannot . intervene if they obey the law.

So in the semi-darkness of pre-dawn . London yesterday, through virtually deserted streets, they counted the . exact number of steps it will take to carry Baroness Thatcher to her . funeral service, and timed her journey to the second. In a full and detailed rehearsal, each . man, woman and horse involved in the last stage of the procession . enacted the role they will play tomorrow. It created the bizarre but often . stirring spectacle of military marching bands playing to no one, . bearskin guardsmen with no crowds to flank – even a minister saying a . prayer over an empty coffin. This was the last chance any of them . had to practise for the real thing – the largest funeral in Britain . since that of the Queen Mother in 2002. Ceremony: The funeral will be the biggest Britain has seen in many years, costing around £10million . The coffin is taken up the steps of the cathedral at dawn as the services want no mistakes on Wednesday . Journey: The coffin is show here on the gun carriage as it heads towards St Paul's . Sombre: This is the path the flag draped coffin of Margaret Thatcher will follow later this week . Salute: Lady Thatcher's coffin will be carried on a gun carriage though the City of London to St Paul's cathedral where a funeral service will be held on April 17 . Beneath grey skies, and then into the . sunrise, a ten-strong bearer party carried and escorted a flag-draped, . weighted coffin from St Clement Danes, the RAF church on The Strand. Tomorrow this is where the coffin . bearing Lady Thatcher will be transferred to a horse-drawn gun carriage . after its journey by hearse from Westminster. From here, along Fleet . Street and across Ludgate Circus, it will be taken to St Paul's . Cathedral for the funeral service. In a salute to Lady Thatcher's . celebrated legacy, the pall-bearers were selected from soldiers, sailors . and airmen closely associated with the Falklands war. A single bell tolled as they set off . for St Paul's. They then moved along the route to the strains of Chopin, . Beethoven and Mendelssohn funeral marches. On the day, thousands are . expected to line the streets. Pressure: More than 700 members of the services will take part in the funeral procession .

Waiting: Lady Thatcher's coffin is shown here on the aisle of St Clement Danes Church . Yesterday only a scattering of . early-morning spectators got a preview of the event, involving nearly . 800 servicemen and women. The rehearsal finished before most commuters had even begun their journey. In the interests of military . precision, a final calculation confirmed that the procession would have . to walk at 70 steps a minute over a journey of some 1,200 yards, as well . as allowing time for choreographed pauses. It was clearly a useful . fine-tuning exercise – the coffin is reported to have arrived three . minutes and 15 seconds over schedule. Major Andrew Chatburn, who has the job . of organising it all, said the rehearsal was vital to allow those . taking part 'to get a feel for how it's going to go so they can perform . their duties with confidence on the day'.

"An Army veteran was assaulted as he walked to a cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday by a gang of thugs who tore off his regimental beret and medals. George Gill, 70, had been walking through a park  on his way to the service in Keighley, West Yorkshire, when he was attacked by a gang of Asian youths he said had grabbed his beret 'like a pack of dogs would a piece of meat'. The gang then ran off laughing, leaving Mr Gill with cuts to his lip, but the courageous former soldier dusted himself off and continued to the cenotaph to pay his respects before reporting the mugging to police. Army veteran: George Gill, 70, was assaulted as he walked to a cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday by a gang of thugs who tore off his regimental beret and medals . Mr Gill, who served as a sergeant with 1st Battalion Duke of Wellington Regiment, had been wearing his khaki beret, navy blue blazer, maroon and grey striped tie - all three of which bore the regimental badge and the motto 'Victory Favours the Brave', when he set off on Sunday morning. He had a poppy pinned to his chest and proudly wore his United Nations Cyprus and Northern Ireland medals on his right lapel. 'I was walking to the cenotaph in the centre of town for Remembrance Sunday, the same route I have taken every year for as long as I can recall,' he said. 'I’d had stopped in Lund Park to look at the embers of a fire which had been lit near a sign when out of nowhere I was grabbed or hit from behind. 'My beret was knocked off my head and I stumbled to the ground. I tried to stay on my feet because I didn’t know what would happen if I went to ground. Service: Mr Gill had been on his way to the cenotaph in Keighley, West Yorkshire, when he was attacked . 'I had not seen the gang of about six to eight Asian lads before this and I think they had been hiding in bushes. 'I had not seen or heard them or done anything to intimidate them. They were laughing and joking and speaking in a foreign language, not in English, so I don’t know what they were saying. 'I was shaken and couldn’t understand what was happening. They had taken my beret as a trophy and they were tearing it at like a pack of dogs with a piece of meat. They thought it was funny. 'They ran off laughing and joking out of the park near the bowling green, and then I realised my medals were also missing, so they must have taken those as well. My poppy had been ragged at but they had not managed to steal that.' 'My lip was cut and I was shaken. Stoic: The courageous former soldier dusted himself off and continued to the cenotaph to pay his respects before reporting the mugging to police . 'I can only think I was targeted because of what I was wearing because it was not a mugging or robbery, because I had £200 in cash on me and they didn’t take that or ask for money.' Mr Gill has only recently returned home from hospital following an operation to fit stents in his heart and he is currently on 13 tablets a day for his condition. He lives alone about 200 yards from the  gates of the park and said the gang were aged 16 or 17 years old, but he did not recognise any of them.. Stoic Mr Gill continued his walk to the cenotaph for the 11am act of remembrance, paying tribute to fallen heroes and old friends. 'There I met my nephew and I told him what had happened and he told me to report it to the police,' said Mr Gill, who still attends monthly regimental meetings at his local Army Reserve centre. 'I didn’t want to make a big fuss about it, but I thought I should report it to prevent anybody else being harmed. 'After the Remembrance Sunday service I got home at noon and went straight to bed, I was that upset.' Mr Gill joined the Army in 1966 and rose from Private to Sergeant until he left after completing 18 years of service and found a job in security. During his Army career he served in Cyprus, Hong Kong, Japan, Gibraltar, Malaysia, and Northern Ireland, where some of his colleagues were killed. He has lived near the for 60 years, and has seen its gradual decline. 'It really has deteriorated,' he said. 'It used to have tennis courts and people played football there, the duck pond has gone and fires are being lit. The bowling green and pavilion have high security fencing to protect them from vandalism. 'I used to have no fears about walking through the park, but I am now reluctant to use it - but if I don’t continue to go in they have won, haven’t they?' Mr Gill said some of the gang were wearing hoodies, but because of the suddenness and shock or the attack he could not describe them in any better detail. 'I want my medals back, I was proud to earn them and wear them. I also want my beret back, but I think that has probably been torn to bits,' he said. Inspector Sue Sanderson, who leads the Keighley Area Neighbourhood Team,has appealed for anyone who may have seen the gang to come forward. 'We would appeal to anyone who saw a group of Asian youths acting suspiciously in the park at around the time of this incident, or anyone who may have seen them leaving the park afterwards,' she said. 'We believe there would have been other people around at the time, perhaps also making their way to the Remembrance Day service. 'While not injured, the victim is understandably shaken by the loss of his beret and his medals.'","George Gill was walking through a park when he was attacked by a gang .

"A group of wildlife watchers scan the open ocean for activity - as a huge whale drifts just below them. These amazing images show a 50-tonne southern right whale and its calves swim within touching distance of a small tourist vessel and its crew. The massive mammal dwarfs the boat and could easily crush it with one swipe of its 15ft tail. Breathtaking: A 50-tonne southern right whale and calves swim underneath a small tourist vessel . Up close: wildlife photographer Justin Hofman said the family seemed more intent on making friends . Monster: A whale watcher (top right) swims next to the 50-tonne whale in the Peninsula Valdes, Argentina . But according to wildlife photographer Justin Hofman - the family seemed more intent on making friends. He said: 'Being in the water with a whale is the most humbling experience I've ever had underwater. 'Not only are these animals massive, but they are long-lived, intelligent, cultural beings. 'Swimming along with a curious right whale calf was nerve-racking. At any moment I thought 'mom' was eventually going to get annoyed with me and swat me with her 15ft tail - and I'd be a goner. 'Yet, with every passing minute we felt more comfortable around each other and they became curious about us and would make closer passes.' Mr Hofman said they were so engrossed in taking pictures, they had a few narrow misses with the huge animal. He said: 'It actually became quite funny because we would be totally enthralled by the animal, taking pictures of the head and eye as they were swimming by - but then the instant we got past the pectoral flippers it became a mad scramble to swim away from the whale to avoid their tail. 'At one point, one of the calves was rolling around on top of its mother, upside down, and its tail was raised out of the water. Powerful: A seagull looks tiny compared to the whale whose 15ft tail could easily crush the tourist boat . 'Humbling': Mr Hofman said: 'Being in the water with them is most humbling' but made sure to avoid its tail . Here's looking at you: The photographer got pictures of its head but then it was a 'mad dash' to get away . 'The calf rolled awkwardly off of its mom and slashed its tail to the side to roll itself over and get a breath. 'The slash of the tail landed in the water just a few feet from me, immersing me in a cloud of bubbles.

"With all the time President Obama spends on the golf course, you'd assume he'd be pretty well practiced by now. But according to Michael Jordan, the commander-in-chief still has a long way to go. When asked about who he would want to play golf with, the basketball legend mentioned Obama but quickly changed his mind, calling him a 'hack' and a 's***ty golfer'. He made the remarks during an interview for Back9 with sportscaster and former NFL star Ahmad Rashad, who asked him who he would pick for his 'foursome' in a round of golf. Not a fan: In an interview for Back9, basketball legend Michael Jordan said he wouldn't want to play golf with President Obama because he's a 'hack' and a game with him would take too long . Umm: Sportscaster and former NFL star Ahmad Rashad asked him if he was sure he wanted to say that . First Jordan, 51, said he would choose golfing legend Arnold Palmer, and he then named Obama. 'I've never played with Obama, but I would,' he said, before promptly changing his mind. 'But no - that's OK - I'd take him out. He's a hack. I'd be there all day playing with him.' 'Do you really want to say that?' Rashad asked, looking at the camera, bemused. 'He's the President of the United States - he's a hack?' Jordan added: 'I never said he wasn't a great politician. I'm just saying he's a s***ty golfer.' The light-humored spat meant that Jordan never got around to naming his foursome - although he did have enough time to tell Rashad that he wouldn't be among the final four either. Not up to par: President Barack Obama, left, who has played 200 rounds of golf since being in office, has a handicap of around 18, while Jordan, pictured right, has an impressive 3 handicap . Jordan is a pretty nifty golfer himself and has a 3 handicap, according toGolf Digest. Obama by comparison 'strives' for a handicap of 18, Don Van Natta Jr., who tracks presidential golfing habits, recently told The New York Times. The president played his 200th round of golf while in office earlier this month - a staggering number considering Tiger Woods has played around 270 games in that time. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker John Boehner have all teed off with Obama at some point. In fact, Obama has spent more time golfing  than he has spent listening to daily intelligence briefings, according to calculations by the Daily Caller. Teed off: Obama has spent more time golfing than he has spent listening to daily intelligence briefings . They estimated he had spent around 700 hours at the briefings compared to 800 hours on 200 golf trips, considering the trips typically last four-and-a-half hours, although one lasted six. But even though his obsession has been the butt of Republican jokes, he's far from reaching the presidential record. According to Van Natta's book, First Off the Tee, Woodrow Wilson was estimated to have played 1,200 rounds of golf in office, but it could have been as high as 1,600. Dwight Eisenhower is the runner-up at 800. He even set up a green outside the Oval Office and visited Augusta National so often that he got his own cabin on the club's grounds.","Basketball legend said in an interview he would like to play golf with the president - before quickly backtracking and calling him a 'hack'

"Fancy a trip to an island swarming with 4,000 of the world’s deadliest snakes that pluck birds out of the sky and kill them with a venom that can melt human flesh? That’s what awaits you if you travel to Ilha de Queimada Grande 20 miles (32 km) off the coast of Sao Paolo, Brazil, which is home to the golden lancehead viper. In fact, the island is deemed so dangerous that visiting it was been banned by the Brazilian government - although not before numerous people foolishly ventured there in the past. Pictured is Ilha da Queimada Grande, an island 20 miles (32 kilometres) off the coast of Sao Paolo in Brazil. Visitors to the island are prohibited by the Brazilian government owing to the several thousand resident deadly snakes known as golden lancehead vipers, which have venom that is potent enough to melt human flesh . Ilha de Queimada Grande, understandably nicknamed ‘Snake Island’, is a piece of land 4.6 million square feet (430,000 square metres) in size. Ilha de Queimada Granda is the only place in the world where Bothrops insularis, also known as the golden lancehead viper, can be found. It is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. The species has a light yellowish brown colour on its underside. It grows to an average length of 28 inches (70 centimetres) but can reach a maximum of 46 inches (118 centimetres). The ‘lanchehead’ in its name refers to its pointed head, distinctive of snakes in the genus Bothrops. Lancehead snakes in general are responsible for the most human deaths in North and South America. This particular snake has a mortality rate of 7 per cent without treatment, and up to 3 percent still even with treatment. Its venom can eat flesh and tissue, making prey easier to swallow, while a neurotoxin kills the prey. Its diet consists mostly of birds, although it has been reported to eat lizards and even cannibalise on other snakes. It’s the only place on Earth where Bothrops insularis, also known as the golden lancehead viper, is known to inhabit. That’s probably a good thing, though, as the reptile is regarded as the world's most venomous viper. The island is devoid of almost any human visitors, save for a few scientists granted permission to study the snakes each year, reports the Smithsonian. It is also visited on occasion by the Brazilian navy, who tend to the autonomous lighthouse that was built back in 1909 before scampering clear. And it’s also thought that poachers have been known to visit the island and claim a golden lancehead viper for their own, with their price fetching as high as £17,500 ($30,000) on the black market. The reason the viper has become so deadly is somewhat of a mystery, though. After all, they are not too dissimilar to their brethren on the mainland. The predominant theory is that 11,000 years ago sea levels rose and separated the island from Brazil, which left the snakes on the island with limited sources of food save for migrating birds. The golden lancehead viper (Bothrops insularis), pictured, is only found on this one island. Here University of Sao Paulo researcher Marcio Martins holds one snake while watching another. The snakes have been known to kill humans in the past, including a hapless fisherman who stumbled across the island . Ilha de Queimada Grande, understandably nicknamed 'Snake Island', is a piece of land 4.6 million square feet (430,000 square metres) in size found 20 miles (32 kilometres) off the coast of Sao Paolo, Brazil . The problem was, though, that most venoms take a while to act - sometimes as much as a few days. By the time the snake’s venom killed the birds they would have moved elsewhere, so instead the snakes evolved an incredibly strong venom that can kill prey almost instantly. It is five times more potent than other snakes and can even melt human flesh. In humans, the bite from a golden lancehead viper carried a seven per cent chance of death. And before the island was deemed off-limits there were several stories of people succumbing to the deadly predators. One story tells of a fisherman who lost power in the engines of his boat. After drifting to the island he ventured inland, unaware of the terrors that lay in wait. When his boat was eventually discovered, he was found dead in a pool of blood covered in snake bites. Another story is of the last lighthouse keeper to inhabit the island with his family. Rumour has it they ran in terror when snakes crawled in through their windows; their bodies were later found scattered across the island. The island is believed to have become separated from the Brazilian mainland 11,000 years ago when sea levels rose, which forced the native snakes to evolve their potent venom in order to catch airborne prey. The island is devoid of almost any human visitors, save for a few scientists, poachers and the navy on occasion . The name of the island itself tells of its troubled history. Ilha de Queimada Grande roughly translates as ‘the island of the slash-and-burn fire’, so-called because of a failed attempt to develop a banana plantation on it. However, in the last 15 years the population of snakes on the island as reduced by as much as 15 per cent, due to a combination of vegetation removal and disease. And on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List the snakes are currently listed as critically endangered. With thousands of snakes remaining, however, it’s probably still not the ideal holiday destination.","An island off the coast of Sao Paolo is home to the golden lancehead viper .

"An in-flight safety video that was accused of 'sexualising the female body' has been dropped by Air New Zealand. The nearly four-minute footage, which features bikini-clad models, has been taken off the air after an online petition was launched calling it sexist. However, the airline says the removal of the Sports Illustrated 50th anniversary in-flight safety demonstration had nothing to do with public pressure. Scroll down for video .

In the footage, the half-naked women advise passengers of the safety procedures on board the plane, and they can be seen flicking their hair suggestively, as well as being ogled at by Maori men. It also includes a scene where women are looking at their reflections in a mirror while wearing oxygen masks. The . petitioner said the video, featuring half-naked women carrying out the . safety procedures in a suggestive manner, made women uncomfortable, . including staff members. 'A . safety video is to alert passengers on what to do in an emergency; it . should not be an excuse to objectify the sexualised female body,' it . read.

They added: 'It objectifies women. It reduces women to stereotype of sexual availability, increasing a perception that women are available to be utilized as sexual gratification (visual or otherwise).' However, an Air New Zealand spokesman denied the airline had bowed to public pressure, saying the videos are scheduled, the Sport Illustrated video had reached the end of its run and was gradually being phased out of the aircrafts it was used on.

"Manchester United have signed a kit deal worth a staggering £750million — more than twice as much as any of their European rivals. The world record agreement with adidas will run for the next decade and ends more than three years of tortuous negotiations. Remarkably, it comes after a  season in which United failed even to qualify for Europe. But adidas are confident new manager Louis van Gaal will quickly guide them back to the summit of the European game because the German sports brand justified their huge outlay by predicting £1.5billion worth of replica shirt sales over the term of the contract, which will begin next year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the unveiling of new Nike Manchester United kit . Final showing: Nike's ties with Manchester United will end after the coming season . No rewarding value: Nike will not renew their 13-year deal with United, and it comes following a season where the Red Devils dropped out of Europe for the first time since 1990 . Where it all began: Nike's relationship with United began in 2002, as David Beckham celebrates scoring a Premier League goal against Charlton . VIDEO Manchester United sign record shirt deal . This was clearly in response to Nike, who . did not take up their right to match adidas’s offer and continue a . partnership with United worth £30m a year for 13 years because they no . longer consider it value for money. The new deal, which would allow . United to buy a player of the calibre of Luis Suarez every year for a . decade, is a triumph for executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who has . had a torrid time on the  football front since taking charge at Old . Trafford a year ago. And it means United have at last beaten their arch-rivals Real Madrid, whose £31m-a-year deal is the next biggest in Europe. The terms of United’s new agreement allow them to bring in yet more millions from additional clothing and merchandising deals. The adidas contract relates only . to playing and training wear and is, in effect, a traditional kit . contract. The licensing from all the other United merchandising — from . posters to duvet covers — that Nike controlled reverts to the club.

Trio: Norman Whiteside, Bryan Robson and Frank Stapleton pictured in Adidas sweatshirts in 1986 . Real Madrid - Real’s agreement with adidas, which runs until 2020, was widely reported to be the most lucrative in world football before United announced their deal with the same firm. Barcelona - Barcelona announced in 2007 that their deal with Nike, initially signed in 2006, was being extended until the end of the 2017-18 season. The original contract was worth a minimum of £24million a year. Arsenal - This is the first season of Arsenal’s deal with Puma, which was announced in January as the biggest contract in both parties’ history. Chelsea - Chelsea and adidas signed a 10-year deal last June worth almost £300million. Man City - City switched from local firm Umbro to Nike last season in a six-year deal announced in May 2012. Liverpool - In January 2012, Liverpool announced a six-year agreement with American firm Warrior. The deal is reportedly worth £25million a year to the Reds. Warrior general manager Richard Wright said at the time: 'We are here to shake up the world of football.' Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich and adidas extended their collaboration beyond the 50-year mark with a new deal in 2011 that runs until 2020. Adidas also owns a stake in the club. England - The Football Association ended a 60-year association with Umbro by switching to Nike. A five-year deal to run from 2013 to 2018 was announced in September 2012. The figure was not made public but the FA described it as 'a substantial investment'.' NFL - Nike replaced Reebok as the official supplier of kit to the National Football League in 2012 in a five-year deal that is the most lucrative in US sport. And there is still an opportunity for United to do a further fashion brand tie-up, with Japanese  company Uniqlo, who sponsor Wimbledon champion Novak  Djokovic, understood to have been in talks. But once again the fans will be hit in the pocket. United’s Nike strip for the forthcoming season, featuring new sponsors Chevrolet, was officially released last week, with adults’ shirts costing between £50 and £60, and kids’ shirts going for £42. But they will already be out of date by this time next year, when there will be new home and away adidas jerseys to buy. United remain the best supported club in the world despite a woeful season under David Moyes. But for adidas to record their forecasted £1.5bn sales, United need to return to their glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson and a box-office signing or two would come in handy. United said on Monday: ‘Manchester United has reached a 10-year agreement with adidas for a global technical sponsorship and dual branded licensing deal for a minimum gurantee of £750m, subject to certain adjustments.' Adidas group chief executive  Herbert Hainer, who had watched two of his company branded national teams Germany and Argentina contest the World Cup final, said: ‘We are excited to team up with Manchester United, one of the most successful and most loved football clubs globally . ‘At the same time, this collaboration marks a milestone for us when it comes to merchandising potential.

"Government study found people who go to the library are much happier than those who take part in fitness activities such as going to the gym (file picture) Fitness fanatics have long weighed up the relative benefits of whether they should bother to take out an expensive gym membership. Now they don’t need to bother - because a government study has been commissioned to find out if it is actually worth it. And the conclusions are that those who fork out regular sums to attend keep fit class are significantly unhappier than those who don’t. A bizarre report, commissioned by ministers, ranks different leisure activities based on how much money they are worth to the people who take part in them. Dancing and swimming, apparently, appear to have such a positive effect on well-being that they are worth a salary boost of more than £1,600 a year. Going to the library is also beneficial - and was worth the equivalent of a £1,359 hike in pay. But fitness activities, such as going to the gym, are actually associated with people being unhappier than they would otherwise be. On top of the huge amount that people pay in gym membership, the study found that the level of unhappiness associated with keeping fit was worth a pay cut of £1,318. Performing music is also associated with making people unhappy, according to the study - to the tune of £1,248 a year. The report was carried out by academics commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which until recently was headed by Maria Miller who resigned over her expenses earlier this month. Although the research - written by three academics - will have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds, it said it is not possible to prove a causal link between gym membership and unhappiness; only that there is a correlation. Last night campaigners asked why the Coalition was spending so much on pointless pieces of research that do not even reach a conclusion. The report ranked different leisure activities based on how much money they are worth to the people who take part in them. Going to the library was worth the equivalent of a £1,359 pay rise, according to the study . Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is absolutely staggering that ministers saw fit to . spend taxpayers’ money commissioning this ludicrous report. It beggars . belief that anyone could think this a reasonable way to spend our . hard-earned cash. ‘[New Culture Secretary] Sajid Javid needs to wage a war on waste inside his new department and cut out the spending on this kind of nonsense as a matter of urgency.’ Participating in dance - £1,671 . Regular swimming - £1,630 . Visiting libraries - £1,359 . Taking part in team sports - £1,127 . Arts and crafts - £1,020 . Attending plays - £999 . Individual sports - £828 . Attending concerts - £742 . Source: London School of Economics . The DCMS study, published late last . week, is called Quantifying and Valuing the Wellbeing Impacts of Culture . and Sport. It follows the much-derided work of the Office for National . Statistics in measuring the well-being of the nation.. The . academics who compiled the report looked at a survey of 40,000 people . who were asked about their participation in arts and sport, as well as . their level of ‘subjective wellbeing’ (SWB). Using this data, and taking into account . other information such as salary and age, they worked out which . activities were associated with happiness, and which were not. Under the scheme used, if an activity increases the SWB by one index point, and an increase in household income of £5,000 a year also increases SWB by one index point, the researchers concludes that the activity is worth £5,000 to them. The report concluded: ‘We identify statistically significant associations between cultural and sport engagement and individual wellbeing, and a range of other social impacts. ‘Arts engagement was found to be associated with higher wellbeing. This is valued at £1,084 per person per year, or £90 per person per month. ‘A significant association was also found between frequent library use and reported wellbeing. Using libraries was valued at £1,359 per person per year for library users, or £113 per person per month. The study found that the level of unhappiness associated with keeping fit was worth a pay cut of £1,318 (file picture) ‘Sport participation was also found to be associated with higher wellbeing. This increase is valued at £1,127 per person per year, or £94 per person per month.’ In particular, dance is associated with the happiest people, and was worth £1,671 a year. Swimming is next, with an effect worth £1,630. But it also concludes: ‘The following activities are negatively and significantly associated with life satisfaction - fitness (such as going to the gym) and performing music.’ However, while the report is happy to say that engagement with the arts and libraries may be the cause of higher wellbeing, it rejects such a causal link when there is a negative association. ‘The negative relationship between life satisfaction and fitness and gym exercise might be due to people with lower life satisfaction in the first place “selecting” into gym exercise - in other words, that people who feel bad about themselves (overweight, unfit etc) may be more likely to go to the gym,’ it said. ‘In this case we would be wrong to conclude that fitness and gym exercise are bad for life satisfaction. ‘A similar story could be said of the other negative relationship between playing music and life satisfaction - i.e. the sad musician. Likewise, the positive relationships we see may be being driven to some extent by unobservable factors such as personality traits.’ Last night a spokesman for the DCMS, said: ‘This research makes an interesting contribution to understanding the wide variety of social benefits, in education, health and wellbeing alongside the more established economic value of the arts and sport.’","Study found fitness activities tend to be associated with unhappier people .

"Ouch: Cory Weddington III (pictured) put a police officer in a world of pain after allegedly squeezing his testicles while being arrested outside a nightclub . A teenager made an eye-watering attempt to escape arrest by squeezing and twisting a police officer's testicles during a scuffle outside a nightclub, it has been alleged. Cory Weddington III was thrown out of the Havana Lounge in Dallas, Texas, at around 4am for underage drinking, according to police reports. But he refused to leave the outside area until he had retrieved his credit card, which he thought was still in the bar. Officers say they gave him 'several opportunities to leave with his friends', but he wouldn't listen. When police arrived, he became aggressive, so an officer used an arm lock to force the 19-year-old to the floor. It was then that Weddington reached up with his right hand and grabbed the officer's privates. According to gawker.com, the police report said: 'The officer put pressure behind his ear and told him to let go, but he squeezed harder. 'The officer then punched him in the face, but Weddington only squeezed more and began to twist his hand, causing the officer ""extreme pain"".' Weddington only relinquished his hold after the officer punched him multiple times in the face, it was claimed. Weddington was later charged with resisting arrest, assault of a public servant and public intoxication. While searching his pockets, officers found he had his credit card all along.

"Gruesome: Richard Henderson said Jason Martin chomped on his genitals 'like a sandwich' and left him bleeding and in excruciating pain. He needed stitches both inside and outside his penis. File picture . A man bit his neighbour's penis until it bled in a row over loud music, a court has heard. Jason Martin, 41, is alleged to have bent over and bitten Richard Henderson, 39, through his pyjamas after receiving a text message asking him to turn his music down. Mr Henderson, 39, said Martin, of Dover, Kent, bit down on his genitals ‘like a sandwich’ and left him in excruciating pain and needing stitches. Asked to describe the attack Mr Henderson told a jury: 'My willy was not attached to the rest of my body. 'I have never experienced that kind of pain to this day and I don’t want to experience it ever again.' Police called to the scene found Martin 'with blood over his mouth'. But the accused denied biting his neighbour and allegedly said: 'How could I bite him... I have no teeth?' Photographs of the injury were shown to the jury at Canterbury Crown Court after they were warned 'they don’t make pleasant viewing'. Martin denies wounding Mr Henderson with intent to cause him serious harm in the row in June last year. Prosecutor Mary Jacobson said the attack happened when Mr Henderson and his partner Michelle Hilton grew annoyed at the late night music from Martin’s flat next door. She said: 'The two men both lived with . their families in the block of flats. Martin’s flat is on the ground . floor and to one side of a flat where the Hendersons lived. 'On . the evening of June 23, Mr Henderson’s partner Michelle Hilton sent a . text to the defendant complaining about the volume of the music coming . from the flat.' Prosecutor Mary Jacobson said the attack happened after Mr Henderson  grew annoyed at the late night music from Martin¿s flat next door. The case is being heard at Cantberbury Crown Court (pictured) She claimed that Martin then went to his neighbour’s flat 'to confront him' about the text and pyjama-clad Mr Henderson opened the door. She added: 'A verbal altercation . ensued, which culminated in the defendant reaching around Mr Henderson’s . back with one hand and grabbing him by the crotch - his penis and . testicles - with the other hand and then pulling Mr Henderson out of his . doorway. - Prosecutor Mary Jacobson . 'Once out of the flat a scuffle ensued during which the defendant pushed Mr Henderson against a wall, stooped down and bit into and gnawed at, Mr Henderson’s penis.' She told the jury that the victim screamed out in pain as Ms Hilton began shouting for help. The prosecutor added: 'A female neighbour came out and saw the defendant with his face at Mr Henderson’s crotch and tried without success to pull the defendant off him. 'A male friend of the neighbour then also came out and managed to pull Martin away as Mr Henderson shouted: 'He’s bitten me!' and blood could be seen in Mr Henderson’s crotch area. Martin allegedly told police he had been attacked after the two had argued over the music and he had grabbed Mr Henderson’s penis in self-defence. Martin denied biting Mr. Henderson's penis and told the jury: 'I've only got a couple of teeth in the lower part of my mouth...I can't even bite into a hard-boiled egg. 'I am not homosexual and there is no way I would put a man's penis in my mouth. Even the thought of it makes me sick.' But he admitted grabbing his neighbour's 'bits and bobs' to defend himself during the scrap. Folkestone Road in Dover, where both Martin and Mr Henderson live . Martin, who denies wounding with intent, claimed he was punched first and then held in a headlock before being kicked. He claimed the blood around his mouth came from a 'fat lip' he suffered from a punch and not from the penis. Martin said he went to his neighbour's flat because he thought the complaint was unfair and was grabbed by Mr Henderson who tried to ram his head into a metal staircase. Sobbing in the witness box, he said: 'I had just grabbed around him (Mr Henderson), I didn't realise at the time that I had done anything to him. 'I just grabbed into an area, I didn't realise at the time it was his testicles.' Judge Adele Williams asked: 'You must have felt his penis and testicles in your hand?' Martin replied: 'I didn't know if it was his penis or his testicles or his upper leg or arm. I didn't know what it was. I was just getting beaten up and I was scared.' 'Now I know what happened, I can't be any more sorry for Mr Henderson.' The trial continues.

"The editor of The New Yorker magazine has predicted that Hillary Clinton will be running for President in 2016, making him one of the boldest names to do so. With sky-high approval numbers and an empty schedule as soon as she steps down from her position as Secretary of State, the guessing game about Clinton's next move is anything but new. New Yorker editor David Remnick wrote a piece for the magazine's website explaining that he became certain of her future run after attending a conference about the constantly-evolving political landscape of Israel. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pushing for president: Hillary Clinton appeared at a political conference about Israel where they featured an elaborate- and extremely positive- introductory video of her . Though many have circulated the theory that Clinton will make her second run for the presidency in 2016, Remnick is one of the most-respected pundits to officially stake the claim. He explains that the tipping point was when organizers of the Saban Forum used an extremely positive video to introduce the Secretary before she spoke at the conference last week. 'The film was like an international endorsement four years in advance of the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary,' Remnick wrote. The six-minute film featured an all-star line up of current and former politicians from both sides of the aisle and Atlantic. Internationally, former prime minister Tony Blair sang her praises as did the foreign defense minister of Jordan Nasser Judeh. Given that the conference was focused on Israel, it comes as little surprise that sitting president Shimon Peres and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, as did defense minister Ehud Barak and former opposition party leader Tzipi Livni. Positive message: The six-minute video featured praise from a host of international and domestic leaders . Domestically, she was touted by Republican Senator John McCain and former secretary of state Madeline Albright, who served under Bill Clinton during his presidency. As if to drive the point home for any viewers who missed the point of all of this praise, the video concluded with two very clear allusions to a Clinton run. 'As someone who knows a thing or two about political comebacks, I can tell you I don't think we've heard the last of Hillary Clinton,' Netanyahu said, smiling at the camera. 'I just have an instinct that the best is yet to come,' Tony Blair says as a concluding remark for the video. Deflection: Clinton joked that she could watch the video again to simply 'count the hairstyles' As the screen darkened, a conference organizer told the clapping audience to hold on as there was another video tribute to come. President Barack Obama then appeared on screen to praise his 'partner' and 'friend' for all of her hard work. And he continued to do so for two long minutes. Clinton graciously laughed the video off, saying that she needed to sit down before beginning her talk because she was so overwhelmed. 'I prepared some remarks for tonight, but then I thought maybe we could just watch that video a few more times. And then the next time, I could count the hairstyles, which is one of my favorite pastimes,' she said, recycling a joke she has used before a number of times. Send off: The video was followed by a second one made of President Obama praising his 'friend' Hillary . The rest of the conference continued as scheduled, the video showed that many in the international community will volunteer to stump for- if not quite make the Clinton 2016 buttons- Hillary if she chooses to run again. Pundits on MSNBC said that the video could cause problems for the presumptive candidate, however, as she may feel that she is entitled to the nomination and cast her net too late in the game. Looking back on the 2008 race, a similar fault occurred when the household Clinton name was trumped by a newcomer named Barack Obama. In a New York Times article today, it was also revealed that Mayor Michael Bloomberg secretly pitched the idea that Clinton turn her attention from the grand scale to the hyper-local: he suggested that she run for his job after he leaves office next year. The mayor, not minding that she resides in none of the five boroughs, 'told her it was a great job and one the one-time presidential contender should seriously consider,' according to the NY Post. He is not fond of anyone currently running, they add. For now, none of those options seem entirely appealing to Mrs Clinton right now. 'I have ruled (a presidential race in 2016) out,' she told The Wall Street Journal recently. 'It's important for me to step off this incredibly high wire I've been on, to take stock of the rest of my life.'

"The MP selected as Iraq's new prime minister avoided religious confrontation and was 'apolitical' when he studied at a British university, his PhD supervisor has revealed. Those qualities will come in handy for Haider al-Abadi, a veteran Shiite lawmaker, who faces the challenge of trying to unite Iraq's divided factions. His government then faces the problem of defeating a powerful Sunni insurgency that threatens to split the country apart and establish a new centre of Islamic extremism. 'Apolitical': Haider al-Abadi, a veteran Shiite lawmaker, who has been appointed Iraq's new prime minister . But oddly enough, despite the leadership job he now faces, Mr Abadi was not interested in politics in his younger years, says Dr Graham McLean, who supervised his postgraduate studies in engineering at Manchester University. Dr McLean told The Times: 'He was apolitical. He never mentioned Iraq whereas some students were vociferous. 'Haider, as far as I remember, got on well with all the Middle Eastern students despite obvious problems at the time when there were extreme tensions between Iranians and Iraqis.' Mr Abadi must cobble together a new Cabinet in just three weeks, unifying Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish factions that deeply distrust each other, all while dealing with a humanitarian crisis and the extremists' rampage in the north. Divisive: Nouri al-Maliki stepped down this week amid accusations his disenfranchisement of Sunnis fuelled support for the Islamic State insurgency . He takes over from Nouri al-Maliki, who grudgingly stepped down after eight years in office amid accusations his disenfranchisement of Sunnis fuelled support for the extremist Islamic State insurgency. Dr McLean, 75, guided Mr Abadi from his Masters in 1976 to the completion of his PhD in 1980. He praised his former student's 'wonderful' temperament. He said he felt Mr Abadi had the ability to connect with people in a way many engineers could not, despite maintaining many of the creative and analytical skills the profession instills. After completing his PhD at Victoria University of Manchester, Mr Abadi moved to London. The Times reports that there he ran his own design business as well as a café that was popular with Iraqi exiles. Mr Abadi was born in Baghdad in 1952 and was one of thousands of prominent Iraqis who fled into exile during the regime of former dictator Saddam Hussein. His father, a prominent Iraqi official, was forced to retire in 1979 and also fled the country, joining his son in the UK. Two of Mr Abadi's brothers were not so lucky. They were executed in 1982 for belonging to the Dawa party. A third was jailed for 10 years. Just in case Mr Abadi hadn't got the message while the regime cancelled his Iraqi passport in 1983 . Mr Abadi returned to Iraq in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and became a communications minister in the interim administration, then a senior adviser to Mr Maliki in Iraq's first post-invasion elected government. Crisis: Members of the Iraqi security forces keep watch on the main highway near Ramadi, Anbar's provincial capital, west of Baghdad, which links the Iraqi capital to the borders with Syria and Jordan . Announcing his decision to step aside late on Thursday, Mr Maliki threw his weight behind Mr Abadi, a fewllow member of his Shiite Islamic Dawa party. He had been growing increasingly isolated as he struggled to keep his post. The U.S., the UN, and even Iran - perhaps his most important ally - were in agreement that he should go. Shiite factions turned against Mr Maliki largely because they saw him as a domineering leader who monopolised power and allowed widespread corruption. Critics say he staffed the military's officer corps with incompetent loyalists, playing a major role in the army's collapse in the face of the Islamic State militants over the past two months. Sunni factions also accused him of widespread corruption. But their principle grievance was that his government sidelined their community, carrying out sweeping arrest raids and violently dispersing protests. 'We are ready to cooperate with al-Abadi to make him succeed in his mission on the condition that the demands of our Sunni people are met,' Ahmed al-Misari, a Sunni lawmaker, told The Associated Press.","Haider al-Abadi will be Iraq's new PM after Nouri al-Maliki stepped down .

"Shocked bystanders watched aghast as huge sheets of ice slipped off the top of a building in Texas and onto cars below, completely crushing them. Plano, in north Texas, has been hit hard with snow and ice since the weekend, but thawing temperatures have started to melt the large quantities of snow and ice that have built up. The affect has caused major damage to vehicles parked in the streets. In one case, which was caught on video, a Jaguar was crushed in Plano, after its roof collapsed and windows smashed under the weight of the falling freeze.

'It could've killed somebody when it went down, they would've been dead for sure,' one witness, who shot the video, told NBC. 'I soon as I stopped filming we called 911.' The avalanches were caused by temperatures rising above freezing, causing the ice to melt and move. Luckily, there have been no reported injuries. Plano police closed Bishop Road, near Shops at Legacy where the Jaguar was crushed, and taped off an additional area as ice continued to fall on Monday. At about noon, maintenance crews began pushing the ice down, trying to reduce the threat.  A few stores will remain closed until the sidewalks are safe.

"A Texas woman made a startling discovery when she bit down into a burrito she bought at a convenience store earlier this week for the bargain price of 86 cents - in addition to the  beans and cheese, Cynthia Corrigan found a piece of latex glove inside her burrito. On the bright side, she says, there wasn't a finger inside of the glove. On Wednesday, Corrigan walked into a Stripes convenience store in Midland, Texas, and bought herself the economically friendly treat on her way to work. Gross: A Texas woman found this piece of a latex glove inside of a burrito she bought at a convenience store for 86 cents . 'I just wanted to stop by and get one, I hadn't had one in I don't know how long,' Corrigan told KWES. 'I couldn't wait.' After a few bites, Corrigan found something amiss about her burrito. 'I was using taco sauce and when I was looking at my burrito to put it . in, that's when I noticed the little blue speck in there,' Corrigan . said. 'I didn't even know what to expect at that point, what was coming out of there, it was so gross.' Upon further inspection, Corrigan realized that the blue speck she'd found actually was the finger of a latex glove. 'It was nauseating. I kind of yelled and my boss came and asked me what was wrong,' she said. 'Luckily no finger in it!' Buyer beware: Always use caution when buying Mexican food from a store that also sells gasoline . Corrigan says she then called the store to alert management that she had nearly eaten a piece of a glove she found in her burrito. The manger told her that burritos come from an outside vendor and the only thing the convenience store does in terms of preparing the burritos is frying them after they receive the frozen burritos from the vendor. The manager told Corrigan to fill out an incident report with the company's corporate office. 'I filled out my incident report and he refunded my money for the one burrito,' she says. In a statement, the company says the burritos are a 'pre-packaged good supplied by a third party vendor,' but said the incident was unacceptable. Additionally, the company removed all of the similar products and notified the vendor from which it buys its burritos. Corrigan says that while she's still a bit grossed out, she is satisfied with how the convenience store handled the situation . Corrigan says that while she's a bit grossed out, she's satisfied with how the company handled the situation.

"Most people have only ever seen a scorpion fish in an aquarium. Unless they dine at Carolina Crossroads Restaurant in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they'll find the spiny, venomous creature on the menu. It's called trash fish dining, and it's catching on with chefs around the country searching for fresh ways to fill their menus with sustainable - and delicious - seafood. 'The fishermen would be like, ""This is all trash, junk,"" but I said, ""I'll pay fair price for it if you'll bring it back to the dock,""' says James Clark, the restaurant's executive chef. 'Eat some butter-poached scorpion fish and you'll swear it's lobster.' Alternative ingredients: James Clark, executive chef at Carolina Crossroads Restaurant holds a fresh sheepshead fish, which is rarely seen on menus, in his kitchen in Chapel Hill, North Carolina . Chefs such as Clark go beyond the usual recommendation to eat small, lower-food-chain fish like sardines, and instead delve full force into little-known local catches that many anglers regard as nuisance or 'trash' fish. Chefs such as Clark go beyond the usual recommendation to eat small, lower-food-chain fish like sardines, and instead delve full force into little-known local catches that many anglers regard as nuisance or 'trash' fish. Clark's menu also offers triggerfish, drum, white grunt and other obscure species. Meanwhile, New Haven, Connecticut, sushi restaurant Miya's features invasive species such as shore crabs and moon snails. 'Eat some butter-poached scorpion fish and you'll swear it's lobster' At San Francisco's Incanto, chef Chris . Cosentino serves sea slug, tuna spines and roasted fish heads. And at . Arrows restaurant in Ogunquit, Maine, award-winning chefs Mark Gaier and . Clark Frasier built a 'Trash Fish Dinner' around whiting, mackerel and . other less desirable species. Besides introducing the public to lesser-known fish, these top chefs also are promoting a broader concept of how to eat sustainably from the ocean, a concept that conservation experts say could help secure the world's seafood supply. Just three fish - shrimp, canned tuna and salmon - account for more than half of all U.S. seafood consumption, according to the trade association the National Fisheries Institute. New delicacy: Sea slugs are making their way onto restaurant menus as chefs use 'trash from the sea' in face of dwindling stocks . 'We have created a system based on demand, rather than on what the oceans supply,' says Barton Seaver, a former chef who is now director of Harvard University's Healthy and Sustainable Food Program. 'We're so busy trying to make salmon sustainable that we forget to ask what's available.' Better management of the world's fisheries also is part of the equation. Two-thirds of the world's wild fish come from the coastal waters of just nine countries and the European Union, says Andy Sharpless, author of The Perfect Protein and head of the ocean conservation organization Oceana. 'We have created a system based on demand, rather than on what the oceans supply' These countries have the legal authority to manage the fisheries off their shores without the hassle of international agreements that govern the high seas and the fish that swim in them - the tuna and other large, popular species. The United States, Chile and the . European Union already have viable plans to protect nurseries and manage . catch limits, Sharpless says. Getting the remaining seven countries on . board, he says, would double the world's available seafood by 2050. 'The oceans can play a very big part in making sure people have healthy and good food to eat between now and 2050,' Sharpless says. 'The goal of restoring those oceans to abundance is more achievable than people have generally understood.' And consumers have been enthusiastic, chefs say. Sales of fish at Carolina Crossroads have increased 45per cent, Clark says. Top catch: Fresh blue crabs are said to taste delicious . At Incanto, customers can't get enough of Cosentino's unusual offerings, including steaks of Humboldt squid, an often 85-pound creature that is 90per cent edible, and fish heads. 'If I had salmon heads on the menu they'd be gone every day,' he says. 'People get it. They're not afraid. It's all about making people comfortable with what they've never had before.' And about getting them to stop thinking of good food as garbage. Many chefs and conservationists say they appreciate the term 'trash fish' for its sensationalism, which might grab people's attention. But they bristle at the idea that healthy, abundant animals capable of feeding the world's growing population - and keeping fishermen in business - would be thought of as disposable. 'There's a long tradition of big famous chefs generating excitement around a new dish that people haven't previously eaten, and having that become a high status thing,' Sharpless says. 'One man's trash fish another man's new taste sensation.'","'Trash fish dining' catches on as chefs face rising costs and depleted stock .

"One of the world's weirdest fish made a rare appearance above the water in these incredible pictures. Photographer Jodi Frediani captured the bizarre-looking Mola mola fish off the coast of California when it surfaced to snack on the Velella velella - a tiny sea creature similar to a jelly fish. But short of shying from the attention, the mola appeared to pucker up for the camera. Scroll down for video . One of the worlds weirdest fish made a rare appearance above the water in these incredible pictures . Sunfish, or Mola mola, are the heaviest of all the bony fish, with large specimens reaching 14 feet (4.2 meters) vertically and 10 feet (3.1 meters) horizontally and weighing nearly 5,000 pounds (2,270 kg). Sharks and rays can be heavier, but they're cartilaginous fish. Sunfish develop their truncated, bullet-like shape because the back fin which they are born with simply never grows. Instead, it folds into itself as the enormous creature matures, creating a rounded rudder called a clavus. Mola in Latin means 'millstone' and describes the ocean sunfish’s somewhat circular shape. They are a silvery color and have a rough skin texture. Mola are found in temperate and tropical oceans around the world. They are frequently seen basking in the sun near the surface and are often mistaken for sharks when their huge dorsal fins emerge above the water. Their teeth are fused into a beak-like structure, and they are unable to fully close their relatively small mouths. Source: NationalGeographic.com . Also known as the ocean sunfish, the creature can grow up to 13 feet (four metres) long and weigh more than 4,400 pounds (2,000 kg). They are sometimes mistaken for sharks when their dorsal fin sticks up out of the water. They feed on Velella velellas, also known as the 'by-the-wind-sailors', which live on the surface and feed on plankton and small fish. Mola mola swim at depths of up to 2,000 feet (600 metres) and spend much of their lives submerged at depths of more than 660 feet (200 metres), which is why it is rare to spot them at the surface of water. Indeed, they tend to live out in the open ocean rather than near shores or the surface. Environmentalist Jodi was on board the whale watching boat the Sea Wolf II in Monterey Bay when she spotted the incredible sight. Jodi said: 'We normally see them resting just below the surface so this was very unusual. 'We were able to watch it as it honed in on one by-the-wind-sailor after another, slurping each into its open mouth, then squirting out a jet of unwanted sea water. 'They swim in a curious, rather clumsy fashion for a fish, wagging their tall dorsal and ventral fins and stubby tails. 'They prefer to feed on jellyfish, but we had the rare opportunity to see one feeding on by-the-wind-sailors.' A Mola mola has not been seen in Monterey Bay for more than eight years .

"Busted: 25-year-old Robert Kiefer is facing assault and resisting arrest charges after getting into a fight with his postal worker over a late check . A man in Akron, Ohio allegedly sprayed his post office worker with pepper spray when a check he was expecting didn't arrive in the mail. Robert Kiefer, 25, was so enraged over the late check that he even attacked police officers trying to break up his fight with the 56-year-old post office worker. The fight broke out around 3:30pm Saturday when Kiefer became angry about the late check. The post office worker told authorities that Kiefer grabbed his pepper spray and sprayed him in the eyes with the irritating chemical. From there Kiefer continued to beat the worker, wrestling the man in the street about a half block from his home. By the time police arrived, a small group had gathered around to watch the two men fight at the intersection of Kling and East Thornton streets. The worker said Kiefer bit him three times in the leg during the fight. When police tried to break the men up and arrest Kiefer, he fought back. They subdued the crazed man by spraying him with pepper spray as well and he was booked at the Summit County Jail. The post office worker was treated for bite and cut wounds at the scene. Unable to post 1,000 bond (perhaps because of the late check), Kiefer remains in jail until his next pre-trial hearing on February 21.

"Clay Aiken lost his bid for Congress on Tuesday and while others might retreat to lick their wounds, the former American Idol star has grasped the opportunity to bounce back on to TV. Aiken has parlayed his political campaigning as a Democrat in North Carolina into a new fly-on-the-wall docu-series with the Esquire Network. The cable network, owned by NBC Universal, made the announcement on Tuesday night after it came to light that Aiken would not be headed for Capitol Hill. Scroll down for video . Man of the people: Clay Aiken, Democratic candidate for U.S. Congress in North Carolina's Second District, poses for a selfie with supporters after casting his vote in the midterm elections on Tuesday. He was defeated in his bid - but not for long as he returns with a new reality show . Clay Aiken, Democratic candidate for U.S. representative of North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District, gives his concession speech in Sanford on Tuesday . The series is directed by Academy Award-winning documentary-maker Simon Chinn and Emmy winner Jonathan Chinn. It emerged that cameras for the TV show have followed 35-year-old gay single father Aiken since he announced his run in February. The series will follow his life in politics as he hopped on campaign tour buses, held strategy meetings, glad-handed at events and went door-to-door to canvass voters in the run-up to the midterms. Aiken, a former special education teacher who finished second in the 2003 American Idol final, lost his challenge to 2nd Congressional District incumbent Republican Renee Ellmers on Tuesday. The four-hour series, yet untitled, is scheduled for early 2015. NBC said: 'Throughout, Aiken struggles with his desire to be seen as a viable candidate and his need to convince voters (and America) to take him seriously.' The Democratic candidate got off to a bad start on voting day Tuesday when, after he cast his vote at Mills Park Elementary School in Cary, his tour bus stalled. The made-for-television moment took place close to the polling station with the bus emblazoned with the slogan ‘Clay for North Carolina’ marooned in the middle of the road. Simon Chinn, who made Man On Wire and Searching For Sugar Man, said: 'We were granted incredible access during the making of this documentary, and in turn were able to capture the internal workings of an American campaign – the good, the bad and the ugly.'

The four-hour series, yet untitled, is scheduled for early 2015 and is produced by Jonathan Chinn, Simon Chinn and Mitchell Tanen. Since becoming a  TV sensation 11 years ago, Aiken has enjoyed stints on Broadway in Monty Python's Spamalot and on Donald Trump's Celebrity Apprentice. He also made the cover of People magazine when he announced in 2008 that he was gay. On the campaign trail, Aiken has also managed to cause quite a stir in his first attempt at running for political office. 'I can get people to pay attention,' said Aiken at a town hall campaign event last month. 'It's a benefit of where I came from and how I got here.' He had been trying to attract independent and Republican voters who recall his appearances on American Idol and had been hoping to catch breaks on the waves of unhappiness with Republican state government and gridlocked Washington politics. 'People are very dissatisfied with congress in general and getting absolutely nothing done,' said Aiken on the campaign trail. Aiken greets a voter outside the polling station on Wednesday. The Democrat hopeful had distanced himself from President Obama during voting and said changes should be made to Obamacare .

'If after three or four years, you still haven't gotten anything done, then what are you getting paid for?' he said. Ellmers, who like Aiken was a first-time candidate four years ago when she upset Democratic Rep. Bob Etheridge, had thrown his political inexperience back at Aiken and suggested he's role-playing to win votes. 'He's an entertainer. He's an actor,' Ellmers, 50, said. 'He believes that he can change costume and get into character and speak to whichever group and win them over.' Aiken raised more than $1 million for his campaign since February, benefiting from Broadway and Los Angeles events along the way. Republican U.S. Rep.

"Discovery: Suvir Mirchandani has found a way to save the government millions of dollars a year . A 14-year-old student from Pennsylvania could help the government save nearly $400 million a year thanks to his ingenious science fair project. Suvir Mirchandani found that millions of dollars a year could be saved by his school district and government agencies, just by switching to Garamond font. When he compared the price of ink, which is more than a bottle of perfume, and the number of documents printed each year, the teenager realized he could cut waste and save money. The idea for his science fair project on type fonts came when he noticed he was being given a large number of handouts at his Dorseyville Middle School. And, while everyone tries to recycle paper and print on both sides to cut waste, there had been little research into how to reduce the amount of ink used. 'Ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,' Suvir told CNN. To find a way to cut costs and ink usage, he collected samples of his school's handouts and looked at the most commonly used letters - e, t, a, o and r. He then measured how much ink those letters used in four popular typefaces, by using APFill® Ink Coverage Software. To be sure of his findings, he printed out large sample letters in the fonts and weighed them, before concluding that Garamond, with its more slender type face, was the most cost-effective. The teenager calculated that if his school district switched to the typeface it could save $21,000 a year. Savings: Switching from fonts like Times New Roman, above, to Garamond, below, cuts ink use and print costs . Homework: Suvir came up with the idea for a science fair project at Dorseyville Middle School . The decision to apply it to the government came when a journal founded by Harvard graduates challenged Suvir to try the model on a larger scale. Sarah Fankhauser, one of the founders of the Journal for Emerging Investigators, said: 'We were so impressed. We really could really see the real-world application in Suvir's paper.' She added that the peer reviewers of the journal of middle and high school students were keen to find out what further savings the discovery could make. The government has a $1.8 billion printing bill and, when Suvir reproduced his test on five sample pages from its printing website, he found they could also save money simply by changing the font. The Government Services Administrations spends $467 million a year on ink, leading Suvir to conclude that if the federal government switched to Garamond it could save $136 million a year. And, if the state government switched, an extra $234 million could be saved, making a combined saving of $370. Gary . Somerset, of the Government Printing . Office, described the work as 'remarkable' but told CNN the office was focused more on switching to digital rather than changing the font. Suvir has not been deterred however, and hopes his discovery will be adopted. 'I recognize it's difficult to change someone's behavior,' he said. 'I definitely would love to see some actual changes . and I'd be happy to go as far as possible to make that change possible.'","Suvir Mirchandani measured ink used in typefaces and found Garamond was most cost-effective .

"Chelsea host Manchester City in this weekend's huge top-of-the-table clash at Stamford Bridge on Saturday - and these two sides have been impressive in the Premier League this season. The Blues are without the injured Cesc Fabregas and the suspended Diego Costa, while Manuel Pellegrini's men are missing Yaya Toure who is still at the Africa Cup of Nations. Here, Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp picks the strongest possible XIs available for both sides and gives his verdict on which team is better... The clash between Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini's sides could potentially decide the league title . Chelsea are sweating on the fitness of star midfielder Cesc Fabregas ahead of the clash . Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (left) is currently on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations . Diego Costa will be absent from the Chelsea starting XI after being banned for three matches . CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) THIBAUT COURTOIS 9 . The best keeper in the league. His ability and calmness are outstanding for his age. His concentration is so good and he makes saves when needed. Thibaut Courtois (left) saves a shot from Liverpool's Alberto Moreno in the Capital One Cup semi-final . BRANISLAV IVANOVIC 8.5 . One of the best right backs the Premier League has seen. Powerful, influential and a monster at set-pieces. He has become an absolute warrior. Branislav Ivanovic is one of the best right backs the Premier League has ever seen . KURT ZOUMA 8 . A young man with a big future. Prone to a mistake but has incredible pace, a good leap and can be a powerhouse with more confidence and experience. Kurt Zouma is prone to a mistake but has incredible pace, a good leap and is a powerhouse . JOHN TERRY 9 . Having one of his best seasons for Chelsea. New signings have breathed life into him and his understanding of the game is still exceptional. Chelsea skipper John Terry (left) is having one of his best seasons after gaining a new lease of life . CESAR AZPILICUETA 8 . Does a good job defensively but playing a right-footer at left back means you lose a bit going forward. His battle with Jesus Navas should be a great contest. Cesar Azpilicueta (right) does a good job defensively for Chelsea but struggles going forward from left back . RAMIRES 8 . Something of a bit-part player this season but plays at great pace and loves getting after people. Big role in stopping David Silva. Ramires (left) has been a bit-part player this season but has great pace that can be utilised . NEMANJA MATIC 9 . Has become vital in that ‘Claude Makelele’ role, but there is more to his game. He has a cultured left foot and with no Cesc Fabregas he can help keep up the tempo. Nemanja Matic has become vital in defensive midfield for Chelsea but can also dictate the game's tempo . OSCAR 8.5 . A bit disappointing against Liverpool but he works hard and is the first to go and press to win the ball. He’s a real goal threat, too. Oscar works hard, is the first to press the ball for Chelsea and is a real threat in front of goal for the Blues . EDEN HAZARD 9 . Hazard can decide this game but because we know what he can do I would like to see more from him, certainly in terms of variety. Eden Hazard (left) can be the player to decide this game due to his pace, trickery and finishing prowess . WILLIAN 8 . Has great skill and a fine work ethic Jose Mourinho has helped instil, but with the way he can go past players I would like to see more end product. Willian has a fine work ethic that Jose Mourinho has instilled in him and will run tirelessly for his side . DIDIER DROGBA 8 . Was a 10/10 player but time has ticked on. He can provide a focal point at set-pieces but can he still score in the big games? Just ask Manchester United. TOTAL: 93/110 . Didier Drogba can provide a focal point at set pieces for Chelsea and could turn back the clock on Saturday . Manager: JOSE MOURINHO 9 . His record speaks for itself, though he has not won a trophy for two years. That will change this season. He gets the best out of people and his team are in a great position to win the title. Now they just have to do it. Jose Mourinho's record speaks for itself - he gets the best out of players and wins big matches . MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-1-1) JOE HART 8.5 . Recovered well after a tough spell last year and up there with the best, though not quite at Courtois’ level. Will be keen to atone for a mistake here last season. Joe Hart (left) endured a tough spell last year but is still up there with the best keepers in the league . PABLO ZABALETA 9 . I love him. He’s the sort of player every youngster in the country should watch as he gives 100 per cent in every game. His will be a great battle with Hazard. Pablo Zabaleta (centre) is an almost ever-present starter in the Manchester City first XI . VINCENT KOMPANY 9 . If we were doing this last year he is a 9.5, but at the moment he is struggling for form and fitness. He’ll be pleased to see Diego Costa is not playing. Vincent Kompany (left) is struggling for form and fitness at the moment but is a class act . MARTIN DEMICHELIS 8 . When he arrived here everyone, including myself, questioned him. But he has adapted and has been City’s most consistent defender this season. Martin Demichelis endured a tough start to his City career but is their most consistent defender this season . GAEL CLICHY 7.5 . Faced one of his most difficult periods a few months ago when he was short of confidence. But has come through it and provides a good contest out wide. Gael Clichy (left) faced a difficult period a few months ago when he was short of confidence . JESUS NAVAS 8 . Seems to be a Pellegrini favourite but doesn’t do enough for me. Can catch pigeons with his pace but will need it to help out Zabaleta against Hazard. Jesus Navas (centre) seems to be a Pellegrini favourite but he doesn't offer enough around the park . FERNANDO 8 . Plays a similar role to Fernandinho, but neither are in Matic’s league. In some games he will run through brick walls for you but in others he has less impact. Fernando is inconsistent - sometimes in runs through brick walls but other games he has less impact . FERNANDINHO 8 . Brilliant last year and one reason why City won the title. Fernando’s arrival unsettled him and they have not clicked. But without Yaya, options are limited. Fernandinho (right) was brilliant last year as City won the title but has been unsettled this campaign . JAMES MILNER 8 . Enjoying one of his best seasons. When everyone is fit, he might not make City’s best side but has a top work ethic and is now a go-to player for Pellegrini. James Milner (left) has a top work ethic and he is now a go-to player for Pellegrini . DAVID SILVA 9.5 . My favourite player on the pitch. Might not grab the headlines but I would pay to watch him every day. Chelsea will fret over him more than anyone else. David Silva (left) may not grab the headlines but he is the player who makes City tick . SERGIO AGUERO 9.5 . When fit, Aguero is a 10/10 player. He struggles coming back from injuries but has two games under his belt and can decide this game in an instant. TOTAL: 93/110 . Sergio Aguero is a 10/10 player when he is fit but he is struggling to return to top form after injury . Manager MANUEL PELLEGRINI 8.5 . Won the title last season but that was more down to his squad - and I still feel there are more questions around him than answers. His players love him but there will be no love lost with Mourinho on Saturday. Manuel Pellegrini's side will fall eight points behind Chelsea if they lose at Stamford Bridge on Saturday .","Chelsea host Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday (5.30pm)

"A woman who went on a fairground ride at a festival has been left feeling dizzy even a year later. Bobbie Lane, 26, was at Reading Festival when she decided to go on the ride, which flipped her and her friends around at high speeds. But while the rest of her friends quickly recovered from the Superbowl ride, Ms Lane did not. Scroll down for video . Bobbie Lane, 26, went on a fairground ride (much faster than the one she is pictured sitting in) a year ago and has been feeling dizzy ever since. She has now been diagnosed with Migraine Variant Balance Disorder . Ms Lane was at Reading Festival (pictured) when she decided to go on the ride, which flipped her and her friends around at high speeds . She has felt unsteady on her feet ever since, describing the sensation as like having too much to drink. Ms Lane, of Ash, Kent, has been diagnosed with Migraine Variant Balance Disorder, (also known as Migraine Associated Vertigo), which is a condition that affects her memory and leaves sufferers feeling permanently 'drunk'. The waltzer-style ride she went on spins riders in separate carts, while being raised into the air. She . said: 'The ride was fun and terrifying all at the same time. I had been . on something similar once before, so I didn’t think anything of it, . really. 'A couple of minutes after I got off the ride, I was still a bit dizzy, which I thought was strange. 'But I carried on at the festival, thinking I was feeling wobbly because I’d had too much fun in the sun. 'When I got home I was still dizzy - it felt like I was permanently at sea.' When her condition deteriorated, she went to her GP, who immediately referred her to a neurologist. Migraine Associated Vertigo manifests itself in different ways in different people. Many people feel permanently dizzy, are intolerant to motion, lose their sense of balance and have vertigo attacks. Some sufferers have 'sick headaches,' sensitivity to light and noise, neck and eye pain, and nausea. Fluctuating hormones, certain foods, stress and weather changes often make the condition worse. It is often suggested that people cut out certain foods, such as cheese and other dairy products, MSG, smoked meats, alcohol, chocolate, nuts, drinks containing caffeine and some fruits, including plums, banana and citrus. Sufferers are often put on medication. Source: vestibular.org . Ms Lane said: 'I had always suffered from migraines, but the doctor asked me if I had done any extreme sports or gone on rollercoasters. 'I told him about the ride at Reading, and he said that was probably the cause. 'It’s changed my entire life. I’ve had to quit the job I spent four years in and I loved because I have to avoid all stress, and my diet has changed significantly - there’s a list of foods I can’t eat any more as long as my arm.' In a bid to attempt to control her . permanent dizziness, the former charity worker has been told to give up . alcohol, chocolate, citrus fruits, dairy, bananas and many other foods. Ms Lane has not yet been tested to see whether she suffers . hypersensitivity to a number of different foods that are believed to . trigger migraines, and has therefore has been advised to cut them all out of . her diet. She said: 'I . think it's the case of stopping me eating any of the foods that might . cause me to have another migraine, which will obviously make my . dizziness worse. 'Some of . the foods are quite strange - like I'm not allowed to eat  salad cream. I . think a lot of people get put on the same diet as me. 'The . foods can agitate migraines because they're hard to digest. The doctors . are going to work out what will trigger my condition more and then . hopefully I'll be able to have a more normal diet.' Commenting . on the condition, Dr Andy Dowson, Director of King's Headache Service, at King's College London, who is not Ms Lane's doctor, said: . 'Migraine sufferers are quite often tested to see whether they suffer . hypersensitivity to certain foods. 'If a patient were to be very sensitive to these foods, it may trigger an attack.' She was at Reading Festival when she decided to go on the ride called the Superbowl (similar to the one pictured) which flipped her and her friends around at high speeds, in a number of rotating cars . Ms Lane, of Ash, Kent (pictured) has been diagnosed with Migraine Variant Balance Disorder - a rare condition that affects her memory and leaves sufferers feeling permanently 'drunk'. She has had to quit her job and cut out certain foods from her diet in a bid to control the condition . The disorder is curable, but Ms Lane does not know when she may make a full recovery. 'Day-to-day I'm on quite a lot of medication, my memory is pretty bad and I get really tired,' she said. 'My head feels like it is floating a lot. It’s a really hard thing to explain, I have never felt anything like it before. 'My balance is awful, I am doing physiotherapy to try and retrain it so it comes back. 'It affects my walking too, sometimes I will just be standing there and I will lose my balance for no reason. It is literally like I am drunk.' 'I certainly don’t blame the fairground - unfortunately it’s just one of those things. I live in hope that one day I’ll recover and then I can get my old life back.' She now hopes to start a charity to raise awareness of her little-known condition.","Bobbie Lane, 26, went on the waltzer-style ride at Reading Festival .

"House prices in Manchester have surged by 21 per cent in a year, the fastest rate anywhere in the country, pushing the average price of a house in the city up to £209,000, Nationwide has reported. The rise has raised fears of a house price bubble caused the BBC's move north, as people pour in from outside the city and artificially inflate property prices. The cost of buying a home rose in every region in 2013, with a national average increase of 8.4 per cent now pricing a typical UK home at £175,826. Price map: Manchester performed best among major cities, with average house prices up 21 per cent . Boom: The house price rise in Manchester has raised fears of a bubble caused the BBC's move to MediaCity in nearby Salford. There are concerns that new residents may artificially inflate prices . Chris Bagley, development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses' Manchester and North Cheshire branch, said: 'The BBC must have had an effect on house prices in Manchester. It’s not just what the BBC brings – it’s what it brings with it. Things are looking better and people are encouraged by the growth of major organisations nearby.' She added: 'I think any kind of conscious move by an organisation that is . seen as prominent, important and a market leader is going to encourage people . to move there. Ms Bagley went on to say: 'Since the BBC moved north, people suddenly think Manchester is the place to be. And they've brought a lot of people with them.' A source at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors suggested the property price rise in Manchester could also be linked to the HS2 project - the planned high speed rail link that aims to cut the journey time between Manchester and London to just over an hour. He claimed prices may have been driven up as investors inquire about buying second homes in the city ahead of an expected property price hike if the project gets the green light. Although average nationwide property prices remain around five . per cent below all-time highs recorded in late 2007, the increase is the . biggest leap since June 2010, and further evidence of an increasingly . broad UK property market. But it was Manchester that emerged as the best-performing area in 2013, with an overall uplift of 1.9 per cent in the North as a whole. Life-changing: David Cameron has a cup of tea with Sharon Ray and her daughter Maisie, 2, during a visit to her home in Southampton, Hampshire which she has bought through the government's Help to Buy scheme . A housing bubble is an economic condition caused by rapid increases in property valuations based on unjustified speculation about how much demand there is to buy. Once the bubble inevitably bursts, property valuations go into steep decline, leaving those who purchased homes at a higher price out of pocket. The financial crisis that began in 2007 was partly related to the bursting of numerous housing bubbles around the world. Banks lost out when people were unable to meet mortgage payments and the value of repossessed properties became considerably less than the money borrowed. Housing bubbles are considered more dangerous than stock market bubbles as historically they last nearly twice as long and lead to overall losses that are twice as large. Speaking of the BBC's effect on the . mood of the area, Ms Bagley said: 'With the BBC on the doorstep there is . also encouragement to film here, which brings people in. We’ve had some . big filming projects here lately.' 'In . many ways it’s down the BBC boost that the FSB will be holding its . annual conference in Manchester this year. That and the Commonwealth . Games.' A BBC spokesperson said: 'The rationale for the move to Salford was to deliver long term and sustainable economic, creative and audience-focused benefits.' They added: 'We have just celebrated two years of award-winning TV, radio and online content and the whole region is sharing in the momentum of Media City with spend by the Public Service Broadcast channels in the region up from 15.9 per cent to 20 per cent.' The BBC announced in 2004 that it planned to move several departments north in order to cut costs and increase regional diversity. However, it has been widely criticised for the £1billion cost of the move, as well as the lavish relocation deals offered to senior staff. The relocation to MediaCity in Salford was completed in June 2012. There are approximately 2,500 BBC staff . currently employed at the 200 acre site, which sits on the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal. Elsewhere, the Nationwide figures show that house prices in London are 14 per cent above their annual peak, with a typical home in the English capital now valued at £345,186. In 1983, the average home cost 3.5 times the homeowners salary. After a dip in the 90s and and peak in 2007, the average home cost more than five times the owner's annual earnings in 2013 . Carlisle . was named as the worst performer, with a 1 per cent annual increase in . prices taking the average value of a home there to £136,128. House prices in Northern Ireland are . still around half their 2007 levels, although they have climbed by 7 per . cent year-on-year to reach £111,612 on average. London has the most expensive house prices in the UK while Northern Ireland has the cheapest, according to Nationwide's figures. Scotland . recorded a 3.7 per cent annual increase in house prices, pushing them . to £136,729 typically, while Wales saw prices pick up by 6.1 per cent . over the same period, taking the average price there to £139,722. In England, prices have increased by 8.6 per cent year-on-year to £205,084 typically. Yesterday, . Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed fears that the Government is . pumping up a housing bubble as he hailed the success of its flagship . Help to Buy scheme. This graph measures final quarter house price trends since 1983. The typical UK home is now worth £175,826 . A new phase of Help to Buy was launched . in October to offer state-backed mortgages to credit-worthy people . struggling to get onto the property ladder or move up it because they . only have a small deposit saved up. The . Prime Minister branded sceptics of the mortgage guarantees - such as . Liberal Democrat business secretary Vince Cable - 'London-centric'. In many parts of the country prices were 'barely moving at all', he insisted. More than 6,000 people have put offers . in on homes and applied for mortgages using Help to Buy since it was . launched about three months ago. Nearly . 750 homeowners have completed their purchases and hundreds were able to . spend Christmas in their new homes, according to the Government. A new phase of Help to Buy was launched in October to offer state-backed mortgages to credit-worthy people struggling to get onto the property ladder or move up it because they only have a small deposit saved up . Robert . Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said the upturn in prices has . become 'increasingly broad-based over the course of 2013'. He said: 'For the second successive quarter, all 13 UK regions saw positive annual house price growth in quarter four. 'Part . of the reason for the acceleration in house price growth is that the . supply side of the market has not kept pace with the upturn in demand, . even though buyer numbers remain subdued by historic standards. 'For example, in quarter three 2013 the number of housing transactions in England was around 25 per cent below pre-crisis levels, while the number of new homes built was around 45 per cent lower.' Mr Gardner said that current ultra-low interest rates are currently helping to keep home loans relatively affordable, with the typical mortgage payment for a first-time buyer equating to around 29 per cent of their take-home pay. But he added: 'However, the risk is that if demand continues to run ahead of supply in the quarters ahead, affordability may become stretched. 'House price growth has been outstripping average earnings growth since the start of the year.'","Average UK home now valued at £175,826 - a 1.4% month-on-month rise .

"There has been contact between McLaren and Lewis Hamilton about a possible return to the team that nurtured his genius. For now the interest on both sides is tentative. He is just one of three drivers, along with Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel, they would consider signing. Alonso, as we reported here a few weeks ago, is the favoured option, though that is more likely to come about for the 2016 season than next year. On track: Lewis Hamilton, taking part in practice on Friday, may consider a move back to former team McLaren . Flying the flag: Hamilton won his maiden Formula One title with McLaren in his second season, back in 2008 . The year's delay would give him time to evaluate how McLaren's new relationship with Honda is working, and save McLaren from paying his gigantic salary – he is on £17million at Ferrari – during Honda's first season, when the emphasis will be on development rather than winning the world championship. But is the notion of Hamilton returning to McLaren pure fantasy?  There would certainly be a space available to accommodate him (or indeed Alonso or Vettel), with either Kevin Magnussen or Jenson Button making way. Magnussen has not yet had long enough to prove he is a driver of the very top rank, while there is an acceptance among the team's hierarchy that Button is a tenth or two shy of the best. There are two possible reasons I can think of why Hamilton would want to return. The first is that Honda-powered McLaren have title-winning form. The second hinges on how this season works out at Mercedes. If Hamilton were to lose the title to Rosberg, imagine the trauma that would accompany that outcome. It is easy to imagine he would feel increasingly unloved, prompting a souring in his relationship with the team. Suddenly, he would not be able to get out of the place fast enough. In demand: McLaren are courting Fernando Alonso's services - the Spaniard is in his fifth season at Ferrari . An interesting interview appeared in Germany's Bild newspaper the other day. They managed to speak to Dino Chiesa, the prominent karting manager, who was team boss of Hamilton and Rosberg at MBM –  Mercedes-Benz McLaren – in 2000 and 2001. What he perceived in them then is a variant of the Jesuit line: give me a child of seven and I shall show you the man. 'Lewis was faster,' he said. 'Nico has always worked harder, done all the dirty work on the set-up, working with the mechanics and engineers. Lewis has never worked behind the scenes as hard as Nico.' Pictured together: Nico Rosberg and team-mate Hamilton penned autographs at a signing session on Thursday . He elaborated on the theme, saying: 'Lewis has lived for a time up in the stars. His management are not very helpful in this regard. They may be good for a Hollywood star, but not for a Formula One driver. These people give him the feeling of being a superstar. But a motorsport race is not a show. This is hard work, and you have to concentrate.' As for Hamilton's mindset, Chiesa said: 'Nothing is ever his fault. He always thinks others want to harm him. 'You have to understand Lewis' position. He is in a German team with a German driver who has also worked three years with the people there. It might feel to Lewis that the team is a bit friendlier to Nico because they have known him for so long. It is normal. That means more stress for Lewis because he never feels like a solid family member.' Fax machines are still in vogue at Bernie Ecclestone's Kensington offices. Emails are for the staff, not the boss. So it was not surprising to read his reaction to the notion that Formula One should embrace new media to offset the decline in TV audiences. 'It matters obviously, but when you say it is falling, it is changing,' he said. 'But I think the change that place will be very short-lived, as these social media people are starting to think it is not as good as they thought.' Writing is on the wall: There is an opportunity for Ecclestone, and F1, to generate money from social media . Asked by Autosport whether he believed F1 should change tack, he replied: 'No. We're commercial. If they find people to pay us then I'll be happy.' The advocates of social media say, probably rightly, that young people's viewing habits are radically different from the older generations. Children have smart phones and can watch short clips of action that would potentially attract them to the sport. That could then encourage them to watch it on TV. There is also an opportunity for Ecclestone, and Formula One, to generate money directly from social media. Other sports, notably in America, have struck lucrative deals for websites to show clips of action. What is so unattractive to Bernie about that?","Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel are also options for McLaren .
Ferrari's Alonso is the favoured driver, but that wouldn't happen until 2016 .
Hamilton may consider a move to McLaren if Nico Rosberg wins the title .
Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen aren't assured of a seat next year ."
"Victim: Shaun Williams was beaten up by the male friends of a woman he was on a date with . A man who went on a date with a woman he had recently met ended up being beaten up, robbed and stripped naked. Shaun Williams was found by police on Friday at the side of the road in Bunnell, Florida, naked, disoriented and covered in blood. He explained that he had just been on a first date with a woman named 'Tree', but instead of going out for dinner she had him beaten up and abandoned him in a field. Williams, 34, said that he met Tree at a convenience store in Daytona Beach two weeks before the incident, and had shared phone numbers with her, according to FlagerLive.com. The pair kept in touch, and arranged to go on their first date on Friday evening. Tree picked up Williams from outside the store where they had first met, and had two men sitting the back seat of her car at the time. She claimed that one of them was her brother and the other a friend of his, and said she would drop them off before taking Williams to dinner. However, after driving out of town for a few minutes, she pulled onto a remote side road and her brother said: 'Stop right over here. I've got to wait for a friend.' When Tree backed into an empty cow pasture, Williams left the car and went to urinate. Scene of the crime: Williams was found blooded and confused on this stretch of road in Florida . It was then, he claimed, that he was knocked to the ground after being struck twice in the face by a piece of metal. One of the men said, 'Give me all your money and all your clothes,' to which he replied, 'Are you serious?' The man said, 'Do you see what I’ve got pointed at you?', and when Williams opened his eyes he saw that the man was pointing a semi-automatic pistol at him. Williams stripped naked and handed over his clothes along with a cellphone and $200 in cash. The officer who found him later that evening took him to the hospital where he was treated for lacerations to the face. Tree and her two alleged accomplices are wanted for questioning by police.","Shaun Williams, 34, found naked and covered in blood at side of the road .

"A home robbery in Washington state was unraveled on Wednesday when a 4-year-old girl living inside gave her eyewitness account to authorities - who later determined that the girl's babysitter was in on the burglary. The babysitter,17, said two black men, armed with a knife and a gun, got inside the home on June 18 while she took care of two children, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said in a press release. In a 911 call, she said she and the children were able to escape. Scroll down for video . Heroine: 4-year-old Abby, pictured, told investigators the robbers were actually white -- though the babysitter had described them as black . Handcuffed: Neighbor Cody Oakes, pictured, was handcuffed after the babysitter said he matched the suspects' description . Authorities descended upon the home and found it empty, the sheriff's office said. A Special Response Team and a helicopter were on-hand for support. The babysitter told police that the home's neighbor, 25-year-old Cody Oakes, fit the suspects' description, the Bellingham Herald reported. Oakes, the paper said, was led out of his home as a sniper watched nearby and handcuffed before authorities soon realized he was not one of the men they sought. 4-year-old Abby said the robbers were actually white, KCPQ reported. 'It wasn't the right skin color,' she told the station. List of demands: The babysitter reportedly had a list of items she wanted from the home, the sheriff's office said . 'They told us to get out of the house cause they wanted to steal stuff,' she also said. Abby told KCPQ the robbers stole her kitty bank and iPod, as well as gaming consoles.

"Suspect: Ammar Harris, pictured, whose previous arrests include kidnapping, sexual assault and soliciting clients for a prostitute, has been identified as a suspect in the terrifying Las Vegas shooting . Police are searching for a 26-year-old heavily-tattooed alleged pimp they believe was responsible for a deadly Las Vegas Strip shooting on Thursday, as they unearthed the black Range Rover SUV involved in the incident. Ammar Harris was today identified as a suspect in the . terrifying shooting that killed an aspiring rapper and caused a fiery crash . that left two other people dead and five more injured. Harris, whose previous arrests in the city include kidnapping, sexual assault and soliciting clients for a prostitute, is considered armed and dangerous, police Capt. Chris Jones said. 'His location is unknown,' police Capt. Chris Jones said today of Harris, adding that he said sometimes goes by . the name Ammar Asim Faruq Harris. The suspect allegedly opened fire on Kenneth Cherry Jr, an amateur rapper, who was driving a dark grey Maserati on the neon-lit boulevard near the Bellagio and Caesars Palace at around 4:20 a.m. on Thursday. The shooting caused a six-vehicle chain reaction wreck before dawn, killing taxi driver Michael Boldon and passenger Sandra Sutton-Wasmund of Washington in a fiery blaze. In a photo released by police, Harris has tattoos on his right cheek and words in script on his neck above an image appearing to depict an owl with blackened eyes. The Range Rover with blackout windows and distinctive black rims was located at an apartment complex just a couple of blocks east of the Strip. Jones said it was impounded as evidence and towed away. Scroll down for video . Car: The black Range Rover SUV, pictured, was found on Saturday at an apartment complex east of the Las Vegas Strip . Cherry, aka Kenny Clutch, had once bragged about stashing a gun in his $120,000 Italian sports car, it was revealed on Friday. The 27-year-old was killed when Harris allegedly opened fire on his car from inside their Range Rover while Cherry was sitting at a red light. He accelerated into the intersection and crashed into Boldon's taxi. Boldon and his passenger died when the taxi burst into flames. Boldon, 62, was a family man who moved from Michigan to Las Vegas  to take care of his ailing mother. Sutton-Wasmund, 48, was a businesswoman and mother of three. A passenger in the Maserati was wounded . in the arm and four people from four other vehicles were treated for . non-life-threatening injuries. The Maserati passenger was cooperating . with investigators. His name hasn't been made public. Aspiring rapper: Kenneth Church aka Kenny Clutch bragged about keeping a pistol in his $120,000 Maserati in his songs . Gunned down: Rapper Kenneth Cherry, aka Kenny Clutch, was killed in a drive-by shooting on the Las Vegas strip on Thursday . Police say the shooting appeared to stem . from an argument at the valet area of the upscale Aria resort-casino . about a block south of the crash scene. The shooting happened after a . night featuring Morocco-born rapper French Montana at Aria nightclub . Haze. The shocking chain of events had family . members and friends in Las Vegas, California, Michigan and Washington . trying to grasp the blink-of-an-eye finality of it all. 'My son was a good boy,' Kenneth . Cherry Sr. told reporters Saturday in a news conference convened by Las . Vegas lawyers Vicki Greco and Robert Beckett. Beckett said they wanted to respond to rumors that their son was a gangster and a troublemaker. Grieving: Kenneth Cherry Sr., left, his sister Becky Cherry, center, and May said his son was not a gangster . Why? Kenneth Cherry Sr. wipes his face during a news conference in Las Vegas on Saturday, Feb. 23, 2013, regarding the death of his son Kenny Cherry . The attorneys had represented his son, and now represent his estate and the family. 'My son was a victim just like the . two people in that taxi,' Kenneth Cherry Sr. said. 'Trouble found him. The people in the taxicab, trouble found them.' Court records show Cherry had no criminal cases or convictions in Las Vegas, and police said there was no record of arrests. The Clark County coroner determined . that Kenny Cherry died of at least one gunshot to the chest. Boldon and . Sutton-Wasmund died of injuries in the crash. All three deaths were . ruled homicides. At the scene: The taxi exploded during the pileup in Vegas . Despite initial reports that the chaos on the Strip was the result of a gunfight, authorities are now saying neither Cherry nor his passenger fired any shots and that the attack was a drive-by shooting. The shooting took place just two blocks . from the spot where rapper Tupac Shakur was infamously gunned down in a . drive-by shooting in 1996 on the Las Vegas Strip. Cherry was only beginning his rap career when he was killed. He posted two videos on YouTube last year and each had gained only a few thousand views. In 'Stay Schemin,' he rapped about hiding a pistol in his Maserati. Police have no said whether Cherry was armed the night of the shooting. Innocent: Cab driver Michael Boldon, pictured left and right, was killed along with his passenger when the Maserati slammed into his taxi . Third victim: Sandi Sutton-Wasmund was a . dedicated mother to her three children, pictured with her daughter and . youngest son left, as well as a twice breast cancer survivor . 'Maserati. Paid 120 for it. Stash box 'cuz you know I got that semi for it,' he sings. The gunfire broke about about 4:20am PST when at least one person in the Range Rover opened fire. Several people were inside the vehicle, according to police. Cherry's Maserati sped through the intersection and crashing into a taxi cab, which burst into flames. One witness said it was like a scene out of 'Die Hard.' Authorities are trying to track down . Harris who remains at large after fleeing the scene. In . a press conference on Friday, Las Vegas Police Sgt. John Sheahan . said the attack was not a rolling gun battle as previously described, . saying that the cars were all stopped at a red light. Charred: The charred wreckage of cars is seen this morning on Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Avenue as police investigate Thursday morning's deadly events . Crime scene: A crime scene analyst photographs a car in front of Caesars Palace hotel-casino . Sgt. Sheahan said police have video from traffic cameras at the intersection where the shooting occurred on Thursday. 'We have a lot of pieces to put together to establish a timeline as to why this confrontation occurred,' he said. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that the high-speed gun battle could have started as a dispute at a nearby casino. LVMPD officials were searching for the gunman and the high-end SUV after it fled the scene of the deadly accident. Three other vehicles were involved in . the wreck, but Sgt John Sheahan said the SUV was gone before police arrived. Strip: Authorities say Harris shot at Cherry's Maserati from inside his black  Range Rover . Tourists staying in high-rise hotels around the scene found police tape blocking access to the area around the intersection. Closures lasted most of the day, snarling traffic in the highly-popular tourist corridor. British . tourist Mark Thompson, who was visiting from Manchester said that the . scene was something straight out of an action movie. 'This doesn't happen where we come from, not on this scale,' he said. 'We get stabbings, and gang violence, but this is like something out of a movie. Like ""Die Hard"" or something.' A tourist who witnessed the aftermath of the crash told KLAS-TV the burning taxi looked like a fireball. 'There was a loud bang, and I hear two other booms. I looked out my window at Caesars Palace...and could see the fireball,' he told the CNN affiliate. Taped off: Metro Police investigate a shooting and multi-car accident on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas early Thursday morning after gunfire rang out around 4:30am PST . Shocking wreck: An aerial shot from TV station KLAS shows the true scope of the accident . The intersection is surrounded by some of the most famous casinos on the Strip, including the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, and Bally's, and is a popular area for tourists. A spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, Jeremy Handel, issued a statement reassuring people that much is being done to keep them safe. 'Recent incidents, while unfortunate, were isolated events,' he said. 'Las Vegas is among the safest travel destinations in the world and utilizes the most advanced technology and training to maintain a secure environment. The shooting is the latest in a series of violent actions on the tourist corridor since the beginning of the year.

"For many of us, snails are nothing more than an unpleasant garden pest. But thanks to a Japanese spa they've become the latest thing in beauty, with the snail slime facial finally arriving on British shores in one East Midlands salon this week. The treatment, which involves having three of the creatures slither up and down your face, has been added to the menu at the Simply Divine salon in Corby, Northamptonshire by owner Diane Corby. Gower, with the help of top dermatologist Dr Sunil Chopra, a regular consultant on Channel 4’s Embarrassing Bodies, has a team of fully trained 'snail facialists' who will make sure the creepy crawlies don’t venture too near the nostrils, mouth and eyes. Gulp: Diane Gower puts the snail slime facial  to the test, with the help of three of her salon's resident snails . Pioneering: The treatment was first popularised by a salon in Tokyo and is now in the UK thanks to Diane . According to Gower, the results of the £50 treatment are instant and 'overwhelming' thanks to the highly beneficial proteins contained in snail mucus. She said: 'It does seem a bit strange at first but the treatment is actually very relaxing and the skin feels marvellous afterwards. Once clients get used to the feel of the snails on their face, they really enjoy the treatment.' The snail facial was pioneered in Tokyo's Clinical Salon and first became available under the name Celebrity Escargot Course earlier this summer, with the Japanese salon charging £161 for the procedure. The 60 snails owned by Gower will enjoy a similarly luxurious diet to their Japanese counterparts - unlimited organic fruit and vegetables. 'The snails have been specially farmed for us,' added Gower. 'They’re not the sort you’ll find in the garden. We can tell them apart and we’ve even given them names. Too close for comfort? Diane looks tense as the snails move around her face and get VERY close to her mouth . Healing: The mucus left behind by the snails is believed to have anti-ageing benefits by proponents . 'The snails' well-being is very important to us. Once they have been used on a client we make sure they’re not used again for at least four days. We constantly monitor them.' Gower has sought advice from snail experts on how to feed and handle the snails and insists that all of her staff are rigorously trained in-house. After the facial the snails are 'quarantined' - separated from the others so there is no danger of cross contamination and clients are told not to wear any make-up or skin care products with chemicals in them before their facial. Despite the lack of the usual creams and lotions, Gower says the results are so powerful that the snails could even be used for people with severe skin conditions such as acne. She said: 'The treatment is completely natural and people have been overwhelmed with the instant results. Anti-ageing: Snail mucus contains a cocktail of youth-boosting ingredients including hyularonic acid . 'So we have clients with skin problems and also quite a few mature ladies who don’t want to use the strong chemicals that can be found in certain anti-ageing products.'Dr Chopra, who is currently running clinical tests on the efficacy of snail mucus, said: 'Snail mucus contains natural antibiotics and hyaluronic acid which hydrates the skin. 'The theory of the treatment is good, now we want to see all the data. The French have found a way to extract the mucus from . snails and put it into skin care products but the live snails should be a . lot more effective as its properties aren’t lost over time. 'I’m looking forward to conducting the study and finding out the results.' Gower added: 'This isn’t just a gimmick. It really works. My spa promotes health and well-being and alternative treatments and this treatment is truly pioneering.'","The facial is now available at a Northamptonshire salon for £50 .

"This is the moment a woman believes that the meteorite which streaked across the UK's skies at the weekend crashed to earth. The partner of florist Joanne Pain, 43, from Redcar, Cleveland, saw a bright light in the sky followed by a loud explosion. The light was so bright it was captured on CCTV, reflected in the windows of neighbouring houses. A still image taken from a CCTV camera at the home of Joanne Pain from Redcar, which shows, circled, what she believes is the meteor that blazed across Teesside on Saturday night . Impact: Joanne Pain thinks she is holding the meteor that blazed across the sky on Saturday night . Then Joanne found the melon-sized black rock in a field outside her house. Joanne said: ‘My partner was outside letting the dog out on Saturday night and he saw something just after midnight. 'He thought it was a firework, but there was no noise, then, just a little bit of crackling as it came down.’ Charred: Joannes says the rock has the 'small white chondrules' which are found on meteorites . She added: ‘We’ve looked it up on the internet and it looks like one. It’s heavy and it has what looks like ""small white chondrules"" described on the internet. ‘We’ve seen pictures of them where they’ve hit cars on the internet and done quite a bit of damage.’ The rock does appear to fit the description of other meteorites which have hit the earth. Many of them are tiny - about the size of a pea - even though they can generate incredible brightness while they are subjected to the astonishing heat of penetrating the earth's atmosphere. Once they finally hit the ground, the meteorite is likely to appear scorched, having reached thousands of degrees Celsius, and could be almost any shape. Most meteors are made up of a collection . of dust and tiny mineral grains which have been floating in space since . the solar system formed. Only around six per cent are made of iron. But Dr Tim O’Brien, Reader in Astrophysics at The University of Manchester, has poured cold water on the theory it could be the meteorite, or a fragment of it. He said: 'This is unlikely to be the meteorite as it was spotted travelling much farther south across England. 'It’s not clear whether any of it did make it to the ground but if it did the likely location would be farther south.' Thousands of stargazers witnessed a . spectacular meteor shower last night, as a large fireball streaked . across the night sky for more than 30 seconds. The . brilliant display entranced watchers at several locations across . England, including Manchester, Derbyshire and the Lake District - but . now the question on astronomers' minds is where the shooting star fell . to earth. Amazing: The stunning meteor is captured shooting across the sky behind a laser show in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside. The shot was taken by amateur photographer Mike Ridley using time-lapse photography . A spectacular shot of the meteor taken by amateur astronomer Graeme Whipps in northern Scotland . Reports of a 'bright light' and an 'orange glow' were received by police across Scotland and the north of England at about 9.40pm yesterday, and the meteor was believed to be brightening as it moved south. While it first appeared 150 miles . above Scotland, the fist-sized chunk of rock descended to an altitude of . about 80 miles above Birmingham and Oxfordshire. Meteors . often burn up as they travel through the earth's atmosphere, but . experts believe this one may have reached the earth's surface intact . because of its size. Charts . showing its route across the sky suggest the shooting star was . travelling at about seven kilometres per second, and may have splashed . down in the Bay of Biscay or the English Channel - meaning the chances . of finding it are slim. Adrian West, a member of online . astronomy group Meteor Watch, said he had spotted the object in . Berkshire, and that it had been seen as far south as Devon. He added: 'It had a very bright orange nucleus and a green tail. It was seen by hundreds, maybe thousands of people.' Star bright: Close up of meteor taken by Graeme Whipps who took this photo when he was studying the  aurora . The meteor's appearance last night prompted a flurry of worried phone calls to the police, as people mistook the fireball for a burning plane. The Met Office tweeted: 'Hi all, for anyone seeing something in the night sky, we believe it was a meteorite.' The Kielder Observatory also reported the sighting of a 'huge fireball' travelling from north to south over Northumberland. The Observatory posted on Twitter: 'Of 30 years observing the sky, fireball best thing I have ever seen period.' Starstruck: The meteor, visible in the top right hand corner of this image as an elongated white streak, was seen in the skies across the north of England and was spotted as far south as Peterborough . Starburst: In this video footage the meteor arrives at the top left of the screen . Meteors are particles from space that burn up in a streak of light as they enter the Earth's atmosphere, whereas meteorites are larger objects that survive the trip and reach the surface of the Earth. Dr David Whitehouse, an author and astronomer, said the object was probably the debris of a planet that had never properly formed. 'It's a chunk of rock that's probably come from somewhere between Mars and Jupiter, and has been in space for thousands of millions of years,' he said. 'There are tens of thousands of bits of rock and grains of sand orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. Some of it comes out of that orbit and some of it hits the Earth.' Amateur astronomer Graeme Whipps spotted the bright light while taking photos of the aurora in Chapel of Garioch, near Aberdeen. Stargazing: The shooting star photographed over Kirkby photographed by Jake Ross . Blazing a trail: This map shows the meteor's approximate route across the night sky . Graeme, 48, who works as a meteorologist, captured the image with a Canon 40D, 15 second exposure. He said: 'It looked like it was moving south or southwest, whilst brightening.' Mike Ridley, an amateur photographer from Durham, managed to capture a stunning image of the meteorite against the backdrop of the 'Global Rainbow' - a laser display by artist Yvette Mattern installed in Whitley Bay to celebrate the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad in the north-east of England. Mr Ridley, 49, a Quality Assurance Inspector for Nissan in Washington Tyne and Wear, said: 'I was standing with my friend when we saw a bright light in the sky moving really fast. 'I was there to photograph the laser show in Whitley Bay, but the light caught my eye so I turned the camera around. 'At first I thought it was a firework, then my friend said he thought it was a meteor or comet - I caught the white light and an orange glowing tail in my picture. 'I managed to capture the trail it left because I took my photo with a long exposure. 'The light was heading north to south. It lasted thirty seconds or more, It was really spectacular. 'We waited around to see if we would see anything else, but it was over very quickly.' Hundreds of people took to Twitter to report where they had seen the shower and Adrian West, of Meteorwatch, said he had seen reports of sightings from Scotland to Devon. He spotted the meteor in Berkshire and believed it could have gone down in the English Channel or the Bay of Biscay.","Eyewitness reports of a large fireball travelling from northern Scotland to southern England at around 9.40pm on Saturday .

"'It's a Wonderful Life' is a Christmas classic - adored by families and praised by critics as one of the best American movies ever made. But in 1946, when the movie came out, the FBI labelled it as subversive - a vessel for communist propaganda. During the Red Scare after World War II, FBI informants claimed the film's portrayal of wealthy banker Mr Potter as a greedy villain was a sure sign of communist influence. Recently-published FBI documents also reveal that investigators had their eye on 'It's a Wonderful Life' and screenwriters Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, a husband and wife duo who were accused of associating with known communists. Scroll down for video . In 'It's a Wonderful Life,' banker Henry Potter is a villain who steals $8,000 that he knows will destroy George Bailey and his family . Wonderful comrade? 'It's a Wonderful Life' has become a treasured Christmas classic - beloved by millions of families . 'With regard to ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" [informant names redacted] stated in substance that the files represented a rather obvious attempt to discredit bankers by casting Lionel Barrymore as a ""scrooge-type"" so that he would be the most hated man in the picture,' according to a 2,000-page FBI report called 'Communist Infiltration in the Motion Picture Industry' that was assembled between 1942 and 1958. 'This, according to these sources, is a common trick used by communists.' The declassified FBI files were unearthed by writer John Sbardellati in his 2012 book 'J. Edgar Hoover Goes to the Movies: The FBI and the Origins of Hollywood's Cold War.' 'It's a Wonderful Life' stars Jimmy Stewart as a small-town loan officer whose $8,000 deposit, enough to bankrupt his savings and loan company, is stolen by Mr Henry Potter, the greedy head of the local bank. Just as Stewart's character, George Bailey, is about to commit suicide, his guardian angel appears and shows him what life in his town of Bedford Falls would be life if he had never lived. This FBI document details the case against 'It's a Wonderful Life' that was compiled in the days of the 'Red Scare' Targeted: Screenwriters Francis Goodrich and Albert Hackett (left) - a husband and wife duo - were mentioned as having ties to known communists . The Christmas classic was nominated for six Academy Awards, including best picture, best director and best actor. It has also been ranked No. 11 on the American Film Institute's top 100 American films. However, a group convened by J. Edgard Hoover's Los Angeles FBI field office found it to be dangerous propaganda, according to media blog Aphelis. The anonymous circle of screenwriters targeted both the writers and the film itself. 'It's a Wonderful Life' and other films were targeted under a film regime designed by Ayn Rand, the 'Atlas Shrugged' writer who has become an icon for some libertarian conservatives in recent years, according to Aphelis. 'According to [source name redacted] the writers Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett were very close to known Communists and on one occasion in the recent past... practically lived with known Communists and were observed eating luncheon daily with such Communists as Lester Cole, screenwriter, and Early Robinson, screenwriter,' the FBI document says. The FBI file also claims that the bureau's screenwriter sources said the film 'deliberately maligned the upper classes, attempting to show the people who had money were mean and despicable characters.' The screenwriters reporting to the FBI claimed that the film would not have suffered if Mr Potter had been portrayed as simply looking after his bottom line, instead of as an evil, greedy fat cat. One screenwriter told FBI spooks he didn't approve of Hackett and Groodrich's approach to Mr Potter's character, saying : 'I would never have done it that way.' The writers also tied the movie's plot line of George Bailey attempting to kill himself to a Russian movie called the 'Letter' that featured a drunken man who loses a letter of credit and hangs himself - only for the letter to be found and given back to his wife.","FBI informants claimed the movie was a vessel for communist messages .

"Passengers have revealed their terror after an aeroplane carrying 230 people was forced into an emergency landing at an airport following a catastrophic equipment failure. The pilot was forced to bring the Boeing 767 in to land at Warsaw airport with no wheels after all its landing gear failed. The aircraft skidded along the tarmac on its belly, sparks flying, and a fire broke out in the starboard engine before it came to a halt. Incredibly nobody on the flight, which came from Newark, New Jersey, was injured but after disembarking passengers spoke of their alarm. 'I was praying for the pilot not to lose control because we started to make circles over the airport. It was terrible,' said passenger Teresa Kowalik. Terrifying touch down: The Boeing 767 hits the ground in Warsaw on its belly after a catastrophic failure of all its landing gear . Relief: Passengers from the Boeing 767 were confronted with a media scrum as they disembarked the plane following an horrendous ordeal . Upset: Some traumatised passengers did not want to speak to reporters as they tried to leave the airport but, right, others relived their ordeal for the news crews . Broken but unbowed: The Boeing 767 still sits on the tarmac at Warsaw airport having stood up to the impact of the emergency landing . 'We owe everything to the pilot. He really did a great job.' The pilot told passengers . four hours into the flight that the plane faced technical problems said a . passenger who only gave her first name, Malgorzata. 'The pilot addressed us a . number of times and said we should follow instructions. Later, a flight . attendant said there might be a fire, and at that point people began to . get nervous and uncertain,' she said. The landing was not . especially hard but the situation became alarming when sparks and black . smoke rose from the plane, said Krzysztof Rozycki, a 17-year-old . passenger. A relative of a passenger said some on board panicked, crying and bidding final farewells to each other. Relatives of passengers waiting at the airport sought information as the emergency unfolded. Drama: Flames and sparks burst from the aircraft as it slides along the ground without any means of braking . Rescue: Fire engines spray fire retardant foam on the LOT Polish airlines plane after it comes to a standstill. Astonishingly none of the  230 people on board was injured . Knock-on effect: Passengers sit next to their luggage as flights were cancelled at Warsaw airport because of the incident with the Boeing 767 . Joanna Dabrowska, 29, . managed to speak to her mother-in-law, a passenger, via mobile phone . after she evacuated the flight. Dabrowska said some of the passengers . apparently feared the worst. 'People were saying their final farewells to each other and some were sobbing,' she said. Dabrowska was among a . group of relatives waiting at the airport in a special room. Her . mother-in-law was returning home after a month-long visit to Clinton, . New Jersey. According to the mother-in-law, passengers removed their shoes and evacuated the plane using the emergency slide. 'She was in shock, but she . was fine,' said Dabrowska. She declined to give her mother-in-law's . name because she didn't have her permission. Other relatives at the . airport would not talk to reporters. One woman whose husband and two . sons were on board said she was relieved, but was shaking and declined . to give her name or say more. Passengers were taken to a . medical center and were examined by doctors, said Przemyslaw . Przybylski, a spokesman for the Warsaw airport. Miraculous: Passengers escaped down the plane's emergency chutes after the landing at Warsaw. No one was injured . The captain, Tadeusz Wrona, has been hailed a hero by Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowsk, as well as by the airport staff and the Polish media. LOT airlines president, . Marcin Pirog, said that Captain Tadeusz Wrona and co-pilot . Jerzy Szwartz carried out a 'perfect emergency landing,' which prevented . anyone from being injured. 'It is the first time a . LOT plane had to land without the landing gear out,' said Pirog, before . adding that such landings do not always end well. Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowski congratulated and thanked the crew and emergency workers for ensuring no one was hurt. 'I thank everyone with my whole heart in the name of Poland,' said Komorowski. The airport has been . closed until 8am on Wednesday. Flights which had been scheduled to land . in Warsaw have been diverted to Lodz, Gdansk and Krakow. Safe landing: The Boeing 767 came down on foam sprayed on the tarmac in an attempt to dampen any fires that broke out . As the situation unfolded emergency services were waiting at the . end of the runway to deal with any potential disaster, while two F-16 fighter jets escorted it to the ground. The pilot had radioed . ahead to let the control tower know there was a problem with deploying . the landing gear. After several attempts, however, it was decided that . the aircraft would have to come down without any wheels. While the plane circled . the Polish capital for an hour, dumping excess fuel and repeatedly . trying to solve the problem, ground crews prepared for a crash landing, . closing the airport to all other flights and clearing nearby streets. Waiting fire crews also sprayed the runway with foam in a bid to prevent a fire . from breaking out. The . pilot lifted the nose of the aircraft slightly as it approached the . tarmac. As it slid along the runway, smoke billowed from the . undercarriage followed by bright flashes from under the engines. When . it came to a halt, fire engines that were waiting along the sides and . at the end of the tarmac rushed towards the plane, dowsing it with foam. Meanwhile, passengers were quickly taken off down the inflatable chutes . on either side. News . channels and TV crews were on the scene soon after learning about the . emergency and the incredible landing was beamed live around the world. 'All safety procedures . worked perfectly fine and, thanks to this, nobody was injured,' said .

"George Osborne did not see the funny side of an outrageous ‘nude Chancellor’ practical joke at a drink-fuelled summit for Tory MPs. Shocked David Cameron and 200 Conservative MPs looked on as ex-Minister Sir Alan Duncan unveiled a painted caricature of a naked Osborne during a raucous after-dinner speech. The painting, showing Osborne holding an empty red Budget box and a carrot, lampoons the Chancellor and his ‘austerity policies’. In the boozy Tory 'away day' a painting was shown of Chancellor George Osborne holding an empty red Budget box and a carrot, lampoons and his 'austerity policies' It was among a series of rude jokes at an ‘away-day’ for Tory MPs at a £200-a-night Oxfordshire hotel, with a banquet, booze and accommodation all paid for from party funds. Tory MPs took turns to entertain their colleagues with explicit jokes – and partied until 3am. Describing his journey to the event with his fellow Norfolk MP, Environment Secretary Liz Truss, Keith Simpson said: ‘I’ve had the pleasure of seeing inside Liz’s red box.’ Sir Alan Duncan also made an obscene wisecrack about fellow grandee Sir Nicholas Soames, Winston Churchill’s grandson. The Prime Minister led riotous laughter when Yorkshire Tory MP Philip Davies mocked Osborne’s chief ally, Business Minister Matthew Hancock, saying: ‘Anyone tempted to lick George Osborne’s backside should be careful because if you go too far you will find the soles of Matt Hancock’s shoes in the way.’ Cameron was still chuckling the next day, telling MPs after breakfast: ‘I hope you have all got the unpleasant image of Matt Hancock out of your minds.’ Former minister Sir Alan Duncan (pictured), who unveiled the painting, also made an obscene wisecrack about fellow grandee Sir Nicholas Soames, Winston Churchill's grandson . Conservative MP Philip Davies mocked Osborne's chief ally, Business Minister Matthew Hancock . The Tory high jinks, which cost an estimated £20,000, were at a gathering of MPs at the Heythrop Park Crowne Plaza Hotel in Chipping Norton in Mr Cameron’s Oxfordshire constituency. After party strategists told MPs how to see off Ukip, the real fun started at a boozy dinner on Thursday night. MPs gathered in the bar at 7pm, and then tucked into a three-course banquet – with unlimited free wine. There were gasps of astonishment when Sir Alan unveiled the painting of Osborne by satirical artist Kaya Mar. Two years ago, Mar took part in an ‘Austerity Isn’t Working’ demonstration in London. He said of another of his cruel portraits of Osborne: ‘He has crashed the economy, that is what inspired me. I don’t know a single family who are not affected.’ One MP said afterwards: ‘It was all very weird, Alan made some comment about Osborne’s paunch. Osborne looked very cross.’ Duncan said of Soames: ‘He is the only man who thinks a selfie is a w***.’ Sir Nicholas was not present. A female MP commented: ‘It was cringeworthy and weird.’ Michael Gove entered into the spirit of the bawdy event when MPs took part in a version of the radio quiz show Just A Minute, declaring: ‘As Chief Whip I must insist MPs do not sleep with one another tonight.’ He added he ‘exempted’ Milton Keynes MP Mark Lancaster. Lancaster is married to fellow Tory MP Caroline Dineage, who was also present. Mr Gove continued, jokingly: ‘However, I am available myself, and you all know my room number.’ One MP said: ‘No one took offence. It was good fun.’ But another commented: ‘One or two were pretty drunk.’ The Tory MPs gathered together at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Chipping Norton for the drunken 'away day' Mike Read has been dropped from a TV advert for a Smash Hits 80s compilation album in the wake of the furore surrounding his ‘offensive’ Ukip Calypso song. Tom Parkinson, of Warner Music TV, last night confirmed Read had been dropped but denied it was due to the row over the star’s controversial song. He said: ‘We had two options for the ad and Mike’s voice wasn’t quite right.’ Mr Read’s spokesman declined to comment.","Series of rude jokes made at boozy Conservative 'away day' in Oxfordshire .

"A university professor in Austin, Texas, has moved into a 33sq ft dumpster, which he plans to call home for an entire year. Dr. Jeff Wilson, a Harvard-educated environmental science professor, took up residence in the trash can Tuesday in an effort to show students at Huston-Tillotson University, and the world, that humans can live on a smaller scale and lessen our environmental impact. Thankfully for Wilson, who's now known as Professor Dumpster, his new home isn't your ordinary smelly dumpster but will be getting kitted out by his students so it includes creature comforts like a shower, kitchen, bed, WiFi and toilet. Scroll down for video . Dumpster time: Dr. Jeff Wilson, pictured Tuesday, Dean of the University College and Associate Professor of Biological Sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, moved into a 33-square foot dumpster on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas on Tuesday . Outfitting the tiny space is step one in the trash can challenge, and the goal is to design the dumpster to be as energy efficient as possible, with solar panels and an energy producing toilet. 'The idea here is to ultimately show one can have a pretty good life in a dumpster,' Wilson told Fast Company. However, the dumpster is starting off modestly. Tuesday night, the 6ft 1in Professor Dumpster posted a picture of his new abode on Twitter with a maroon sleeping bag laid out tightly in the small space with little else in view. If occasionally Wilson needs a break from the box, students can opt to take his place for the night. One student, Evette Jackson, has already signed up. Mod cons: Thankfully for Wilson, pictured, his new home isn't your ordinary smelly dumpster but a special version customized by his students that includes creature comforts like a shower, kitchen, bed, WiFi and toilet . Not very big: Wilson posted a picture of his new home on Twitter Tuesday with the comment 'Bird's eye view of dumpster home at bedtime' 'I think it's pretty intriguing,' she told KVUE. 'It's pretty cool. I want to live in it too.' After the year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the United States, educating students about the possibility of following in his 'less is more' footsteps. Wilson said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at Starbucks. 'I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster,' he told Fast Company. So when the lease ran out on his lovely, full-sized, apartment a year later, he posted an announcement on Facebook, which read: 'Starting at 6pm, I will be selling all of my home furnishings, clothes, kitchen appliances, and everything else in the apartment for $1 an item.' Help: Wilson, right, had help from students and other educators including Dr Karen Magid, pictured . Concerns: A week before move in, Wilson wrote a list of his concerns with 'heating' number one . Despite, the five-item-per-person . maximum, his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase, . which was coming with him to the dumpster. However, the dumpster wasn't ready at this stage, so he moved into his office for the next seven months, secretly sleeping on the floor. 'Keeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,' he told the website. But the low-impact living experiment, officially known as The Dumpster Project, is finally ready to begin - and it has the university's backing. Scrub: Five days ago, Wilson was giving his dumpster a clean out . Cute: Wilson posted a picture of him and his girlfriend two weeks ago with the comment, 'Honey, I'm home. This place looks like a dump' Vs: Wilson's previous front porch was slightly more desirable . 'I'm essentially becoming part of the . 1 per cent, he jokes. 'This dumpster is 33 sq ft, which is 1 per cent . the size of the new American home...' But as he undergoes this transformation, so will his students in campus dorms, whom he'll expect to replace light-bulbs and install low-flow shower heads. The goal is to bring sustainability to the center of the college experience. 'What we are talking about right now is to start a green movement within historically black colleges and universities, and become the flagship school of that, under an initiative called ""Green is the New Black,""' he told Fast Company. In the meantime, Wilson says he's going to take his dumpster life one day at a time. 'It's going to be pretty overwhelming,' he said. 'I can't think too far ahead in this project and stay sane.'","Dr. Jeff Wilson, a Harvard-educated environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, moved into the dumpster Tuesday .

"Facebook has agreed to dish out a whopping $10million to charity to settle a lawsuit that accused the site of violating users' rights to control the use of their own names, photos and likenesses, according to court documents made public this weekend. The lawsuit, brought by five Facebook members in California, alleged that the social networking site violated state law by publicizing users' 'likes' of certain advertisers on its 'sponsored stories' feature without paying them or giving them a way to opt out, the documents said. The blockbuster settlement could potentially allow millions of other Facebook users to pursue similar legal action. On the timeline: A 'sponsored story' is an ad that appears on a user's Facebook page and consists of another friend's name, picture and an assertion that the person 'likes' the advertiser . Dislike: Five plaintiffs had shown economic injury could occur through Palo Alto, California-based Facebook's use of their names, photographs and likenesses . A 'sponsored story' is an advertisement . that appears on a user's Facebook page and generally consists of another . friend's name, picture and an assertion that the person 'likes' the . advertiser. The lawsuit charges that Facebook's . terms of use 'mislead its users into believing that they can prohibit . the use of their name and profile picture in advertisements.' The ads were started in early 2011. The settlement, which was reached last month but made public this weekend, puts a question mark over a major source of ad revenue for the company. Facebook declined to comment on Saturday. Boss: Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had been quoted as saying that that a trusted referral from a Facebook friend was the 'Holy Grail' of advertising . The proposed class-action suit, filed in . federal court in San Jose, California, could have included nearly one . of every three Americans, with billions in damages - another potential . black eye for a company that has struggled since its disastrous initial . public offering last month. In the lawsuit, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was quoted as saying that a trusted referral was the 'Holy Grail' of advertising. Facebook's chief technology officer, Bret Taylor (pictured), is departing 'sometime this summer' to start his own company, in the first exit of a high-profile executive since the social networking company's IPO on May 18. Taylor said he will be starting up a new company with Kevin Gibbs, a senior Google engineer, according to his Facebook profile. The news was first reported by AllThingsD. Some investors had speculated that Facebook would have trouble holding onto key talent following its IPO, which created many millionaires among its ranks. Facebook executive Mike Vernal will take over the platform division, one of Taylor's key jobs. Cory Ondrejka will take over mobile, a source familiar with the situation confirmed. In addition, the lawsuit cited comments from Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, saying that the value of a 'sponsored story' advertisement was at least twice and up to three times the value of a standard Facebook.com ad without a friend endorsement. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said the plaintiffs had shown economic injury could occur through Facebook's use of their names, photographs and likenesses. 'California has long recognized a right . to protect one's name and likeness against appropriation by others for . their advantage,' Koh wrote. The settlement arrangement is known as a cy-pres settlement, meaning the settlement funds can go to charity. A judge still needs to approve the settlement. The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is Angel Fraley et al., individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated vs. Facebook Inc., 11-cv-1726. Facebook shares closed at $30.01 on Friday, down 21 per cent since the company's initial public offering last month. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed against Facebook from disgruntled shareholders. Ad blitz: The proposed class-action lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Jose, California, could have included nearly one of every three Americans, with billions of dollars in damages, according to previous court documents .","Lawsuit brought by five Facebook users in California who charge that they were misled by the company's terms of use .

"Fish are often classed as ugly, slimy creatures but these latest images reveal their inner beauty. Each of the marine specimens have been bleached to make the skin clear and then stained to expose their complex and elegant skeletons. They include the Spiny Lumpsucker, the Little Skate and the Butterfly Ray and form part of the Cleared exhibition due to go on display in Seattle in March. The fish in the Cleared exhibition, including the including this Scalyhead Sculpin, pictured, were bleached before being dyed to make the stained skeletal tissue visible through the skin and flesh. They were then submerged in a large container of glycerine and photographed in various poses. The process is used in the science of Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics . The project was created by Professor Adam Summers, associate director of Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics at Washington University. He collected the specimens from various fisheries, with many having died during scientific studies. One study, for example, had focused on the developmental trajectory of the fish skeleton. The fish were treated at the Biomechanics Lab at Friday Harbour in Washington. Each fish was stained using two specific dyes - Alcian Blue to stain the cartilaginous elements deep blue, and Alizarin Red S to turn the tissue a crimson colour. The fish were then bleached in hydrogen peroxide to remove any dark pigments. The fish, including this Spiny Lumpsucker, were treated at the Biomechanics Lab at Friday Harbour in Washginton.

To make the fish appear invisible, each specimen was then submerged in glycerine and placed into various poses before being photographed using a Canon 5D Mark III camera fitted with a 100mm Macro lens. Professor Summers told Seattle Aquarium, where the display is being held: ‘This technique is only effective on specimens that are less than about 1cm in thickness, and takes much longer for thick specimens than thin.

'A small fish might take three days to process while a larger animal could take several months.' Professor Summers continued that he has a camera on a tripod and uses a remote shutter release to take the shots each time. To make sure the glycerine is still, Professor Summers said he poses the fish and leaves the set up for several hours before taking the images. The glycerine is placed on a colour corrected LED light table to highlight the specimens. There are 14 specimens in total in the display.

"A freak 11-stone halibut has been line caught off the Shetland coast and is expected to serve up to 300 people. The huge fish is believed to be about 50 years old and is about three times the size of regular halibut catches. The remarkable fish has been sold to a seafood restaurant for £950 where it will be made into roughly 300 portions and make the establishment three times the cost in profit. Human-sized: The giant halibut is longer than Crabshakk's head chef David Scott . Monster: The enormous halibut, caught off the Shetland coast, is believed to be about 50 years old . Big operation: Restaurant owner John Macleod said they would be unlikely to see such a large fish again . The catch is immediately being put on the menu and will be served to customers this weekend. The giant fish is so big, it is longer than head chef David Scott, who was given the task of filleting it. Mr Scott, head chef at the restaurant, where fish and chips sells for £9.50, will turn the massive halibut into fillets, scampi and curry. The rare halibut was line-caught in the deep waters off the North Sea, near Shetland, Scotland, by commercial fishermen. Crabshakk owner John Macleod said: 'I don't think any of us will ever see a bigger wild halibut than this.' Pricey: The restaurant paid £950 for the whopper fish but expect to make three times that amount . All hands on deck: The entire team of chefs helped to fillet the fish, which will be divided into about 300 portions . Enormous: Despite weighing in at 11-stone, the halibut is still shy of the 34-stone record . A spokesman for supplier John Vallance said: 'Finding a 70kg halibut is extremely rare, and certainly not as common as the usual 20-30kg.' At 11-stone (70kg) the huge fish is still somewhat shy of the largest halibut ever caught. In 2010, veteran German angler Günther Hansel, 70, reeled in a 34-stone (220kg monster) which was sold for £2,500. The previous largest halibut was a 33-stone (210kg) fish caught off Norway in 2009. Atlantic halibut are among the largest fish in the world and can grow up to 15ft long. They have been overfished in the past few decades and have been placed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list and listed as endangered. Versatile: The 50-year-old halibut will be turned into curry, scampi and fillets . Record breakers: Halibut are among the world's largest fish and can grow up to 15ft long . Money well spent: The Crabshakk restaurant expects to make up to £3,000 from the giant fish .","The huge fish will serve about 300 people at Crabshakk restaurant in Glasgow .

"Regular exercise may keep Alzheimer’s at bay – even in those whose genes put them in the dementia danger zone. A study of men and women in their 60s, 70s and 80s found that being active at least three times a week stopped the brain from shrinking. Strikingly, even those with a common gene called APOE-e4 were protected by brisk walking, jogging, swimming and cycling. Strenuous household chores also helped. A study of men and women in their 60s, 70s and 80s found that being active at least three times a week stopped the brain from shrinking potentially helping keep Alzheimer's at bay (posed by model) The brain normally shrinks with age, and the hippocampus, the brain’s memory hub is particularly vulnerable in those at genetic risk of dementia. Kirk Erickson, an expert in the ageing brain, said: ‘This is the first study look at how physical activity might impact the loss of hippocampal volume in people at genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. ‘There are no other treatments shown to preserve hippocampal volume in those that may develop Alzheimer’s disease. ‘This study has tremendous implications for how we might intervene, prior to the development of any dementia symptoms, in older adults who are at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. The APOE-e4 gene is carried by up to 30 per cent of the population. It increases the risk of Alzheimer’s in old age but not everyone with the suspect DNA will develop the disease. The latest finding suggests the exercise may be one of the factors that decides if a brain is able to overcome its genetic inheritance. The US researchers measured the brain size of four groups of pensioners at the start and end of the 18-month study. The study found that even those with a common Alzheimer's gene called APOE-e4 were protected by brisk walking, jogging, swimming and cycling . The amount of exercise they did was monitored and they were tested for the APOE-e4 gene. The only brain shrinkage occurred in those with the gene who did little or no exercise. Those with the gene who were at least moderately physically active three times a week or more were protected, the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience reports. Researcher Dr J. Carson Smith, of the University of Maryland, said: ‘We found that physical activity has the potential to preserve the volume of the hippocampus in those with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease, which means we can possibly delay cognitive decline and the onset of dementia symptoms in these individuals. ‘Physical activity interventions may be especially potent and important for this group.’ He added that future research is needed to work out how exercise and genetics interact to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s. And that more evidence could lead to those with a family history of the disease being ‘prescribed’ exercise. Dr Smith said: ‘We do not yet have the level of exercise needed to justify this approach specifically for Alzheimer’s prevention but exercise certainly cannot harm, so should be prescribed regardless.’ Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect some 800,000 Britons and the number is predicted to double in a generation as the population ages. APOE-E4 raises the risk of the disease up to ten-fold and up to 40 per cent of people who develop Alzheimer’s in old have the gene.","Study found being active at least three times a week stops brain shrinking .

"The parents of a 17-year-old football player whose teacher allegedly performed a sex act on him after a pep rally have filed a $3million lawsuit against the school. Symone Greene, 22, was arrested last week on charges that she has sex with the student on her first day teaching at Options Public Charter School in Washington, D.C. The boy's parent's claim that the school and the private company that hired Greene didn't do enough to ensure she wouldn't prey on the vulnerable students under her care, WRC-TV reports. Greene is also named in the suit. Scroll down for video . Symone Greene, 22, is accused of performing a sex act on a 17-year-old student in her classroom on her very first day of school . Greene is charged with firs-degree sexual abuse of a minor because as a teacher she had power of the teen . The teen, a football player, recorded Greene performing a sex act on him after a high school pep rally for the team, authorities say . They say their son has a learning disability and that Greene took advantage of him on October 17 when she allegedly had sexual relations with him in an empty classroom following a pep rally for the football team. The lawsuit alleges that Green initiated the flirting that led to the alleged sexual encounter and that another teacher witnessed the flirting but did nothing to intervene. The teen told police that he 'flirted' with the teacher earlier in the day on October 17 and that he sent a text message to her asking if she was 'kinky.' None of that matters says the lawyer for the boy's family. 'Even if that young man came into his classroom wearing nothing but boxers and came on even stronger than what's been alleged in the complaint, then that teacher had a duty to step in and stop that behavior, notify the proper authorities and hold fast to the standard which we has members of the society expect our teachers to live up to,' Governor Jackson told WRC. The sex attack at the end of the school's pep rally - it allegedly occurred in Greene's classroom where the student recorded the oral sex,  without Greene's knowledge, according to the warrant. Greene then allegedly sent the teen a text message over the weekend asking him not to tell anyone because 'it is not right for a student and teacher to have a relationship.' Greene allegedly let the boy take video of the sexual encounter, which he then shared with his football teammates and other friends.  She posted this photo on her Google+ account . Symone Greene, 22, was working at Options Public Charter School (pictured) in Northeast D.C. on Friday when she first met the victim, a 17-year-old football player, according to court documents . She also allegedly sent a clothed picture of herself to the student, reports WUSA. 'When school administrators learned of the incident Monday morning, we immediately contacted the Child and Family Services Agency, the Metropolitan Police Department, and the parent of the student,' Shannon Hodge, the school's executive director, said in a statement. Hodge said Greene was contracted through a company based in Delaware and had never worked at the school before. Greene was arrested and charged this week, according to the documents.","Parents say the student, 17, has a learning disability and that the student took advantage of him .

"Nigel Farage faces questioning by Scotland Yard over claims his alleged ‘mistress’ falsely accused a Conservative MP of sexual assault, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Detectives investigating claims that Annabelle Fuller fabricated a case against Andrew Bridgen have established that Ms Fuller made phone calls to Mr Farage on the evening in question. Mr Bridgen was arrested after Ms Fuller complained that he had groped her on the balcony of his Central London flat three years ago – but the charges were dropped shortly afterwards when Ms Fuller withdrew her allegations. Scroll down for video . Andrew Bridgen MP was asked for a divorce from his wife Jackie after the incident - charges were dropped . Detectives investigating claims that Annabelle Fuller (pictured) fabricated a case about the MP . The MP for North West Leicestershire says his marriage was wrecked as a result of the case and he now has limited contact with his children. Scotland Yard officers plan to question everyone Ms Fuller phoned during the night of June 8, 2011, including Mr Farage, to establish whether she gave a deliberately false account. There is no suggestion Mr Farage was complicit with any alleged wrongdoing by Ms Fuller, who was working as one of his aides at the time. Ms Fuller, 32, was described as Farage’s ‘former mistress’ under Parliamentary privilege in Strasbourg earlier this year by Nikki Sinclaire, a former Ukip MEP. Both Mr Farage and Ms Fuller strongly deny an affair. Ms Fuller has since stopped working for the party. Scotland Yard’s investigation into Ms Fuller was launched after claims made by Jasna Badzak, a former Ukip official who says she exchanged messages with Ms Fuller about the incident soon afterwards. Ms Badzak also claims that Ms Fuller boasted to her that she had seen messages on Mr Bridgen’s BlackBerry phone from David Cameron. Ms Fuller believes Ms Badzak’s allegations are politically motivated, and insists other claims she has made about the party have proved unfounded. Ms Fuller, 32, was described as Farage’s ‘former mistress’ under Parliamentary privilege in Strasbourg earlier this year by Nikki Sinclaire, a former Ukip MEP. Both Mr Farage and Ms Fuller strongly deny an affair . Mr Bridgen, 50, was arrested after Ms Fuller told police he reached up her skirt and touched her on the bottom and leg. Shortly after, Ms Fuller claimed in a newspaper interview that she met Mr Bridgen at a Westminster pub with a civil servant, and that all three went back to the MP’s flat after midnight to continue a discussion about military charities. Fuller ran from the property in the early hours, grabbing Mr Bridgen’s BlackBerry and Commons pass as evidence. The police were called by a security guard, which is when Ms Fuller made her allegation. Despite charges being dropped, Mr Bridgen was asked for a divorce soon after the incident. The separated couple are embroiled in an acrimonious legal dispute while living at opposite ends of his constituency home. He has told friends he is largely estranged from his two young sons. Asked if she wanted to explain her calls to Mr Farage, Ms Fuller declined. Mr Bridgen said: ‘It would be inappropriate to comment while a police investigation is under way.’ Mr Farage’s spokeswoman said: ‘No comment.

"Threatening: Geoffrey McGann, 49, of Rancho Palos Verdes was arrested at Oakland International Airport after found wearing a watch that looked like a timing device for an explosive . Police claim to have foiled a terror threat after arresting a man as he attempted to board a plane with what they say were bomb-making materials hidden inside a homemade wristwatch. But Geoffrey McGann claims he is an artist and insists the bizarre timepiece is nothing more sinister than an art project. The 49-year-old from the Los Angeles suburbs was taken into custody at Oakland . International Airport on Thursday night with what appeared to be a . potential triggering device for a bomb. 'The watch had on it a toggle switch, a series of fuses, a series of wires protruding from it, a circuit board and the watch itself was on a direct timer,' Alameda County Sheriff's Sergeant J.D. Nelson said. TSA agents said they became suspicious of McGann when he tried to get the object through airport security by putting it in a bin covered by his jacked. Sgt Nelson said that was just one of many irregularities which led officers to be disturbed by his demeanour and attire. 'He was wearing a military style shirt that has a built-in tourniquet in the sleeves,' he said. McGannwas also wearing shoes two sizes too big and packed with layers of insoles - an eery similarity to the explosive device worn by the 2001 shoe bomber, Richard Reid. Scroll down for video .

Free to go: McGann, a managing creative director according to his Facebook profile, was released after posting $150,000 bail on Saturday . 'They also had what appeared to be a homemade cavity in them and he was very evasive on everything that he was doing,'  Nelson said. The official said the bomb squad arrived within five minutes and determined there were no explosive materials in the watch. 'Obviously he was missing a couple of things along the way,' Nelson admitted, while insisting police regarded the watch as a possible 'triggering device.' According to McGann's Facebook page he is managing creative director of a media, marketing and advertising group, having studied visual communication design in college. He is also a father to a little girl. Asked if the sheriff's department had any idea of a possible motive for smuggling the device onboard, Nelson suggested it was possible McGann was testing out airport security systems in preparation for a full-blown attack at a later date. 'That's always a concern that someone is making a dry run,' he said. McGann was taken to Santa Rita Jail where he was charged with possessing materials to make an explosive device.

"A benefits claimant who has been on the dole for 20 years has fathered 26 children with 15 women, it emerged today. Peter Rolfe, 64, who lives in a council home in Newport, Isle of Wight, has reportedly cost the British taxpayer £500,000 through claiming child and housing benefits. The man first hit the headlines this March when he claimed his human rights were being violated  because his local council would only provide him with a four-bedroom house. Father-of-26 Peter Rolfe, 64, has reportedly cost the taxpayer £500,000 by being on the dole for 20 years . Mr Rolfe claims to have 26 children - 14 girls and 12 boys - by 15 women. He said today: 'Some of them [the mothers of his children] got pregnant on purpose. It's just so unfortunate so many women have fallen pregnant' At the time, he claimed he had 18 children by ten women while demanding council bosses had a ‘duty of care’ to upgrade him and his family to a six-bedroom home. Now the man says he actually has 26 children - 14 boys and 12 girls - by a staggering 15 women while appearing on a new Channel 5 documentary. In shocking scenes featured on Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole, Mr Rolfe also make the staggering suggestion the mothers of his children are to blame for the size of his brood adding: 'Some of them I believe got pregnant on purpose.' In an interview with the Daily Express, the man continued: 'It is really difficult to keep track when you've had 26 kids with so many different women. 'You have women that like you and once they get you they try to change you. They become pregnant and things like that.

Reports today suggest he has cost the British taxpayer £500,000 over 20 years of being on the dole . 'Some of them got pregnant on purpose. It's just so unfortunate so many women have fallen pregnant.' Mr Rolfe used to receive £800 a week thanks to the benefits system. This figure has since been cut following a benefits cap introduced last year. He is still calling for his local council to upgrade his family to a larger home - saying his current residence is 'like a prison cell'. Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe last night slammed Mr Rolfe as 'Britain's most feckless father.' The documentary follows the lives of some of Britain's biggest benefits claimants - and exposes parents who see their children as a ticket to an easy life. Mr Rolfe's 'prison cell' home on the Isle of Wight - which the father claims breaches his family's human rights . Other 'stars' of the show include Tim Fisk and Mandy Ball - who claim £80,000 a year in benefits and support 14 children. Another, single mother Marie Buchan, 32, claims £2,200 a month in handouts has seven girls and one boy. According to the latest figures, the British benefits bill hit £167.7billion which is expected to increase to £171.5billion by 2018-9. Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The point of the welfare state is to support the most vulnerable in the society, not to be a long-term alternative to work. 'The government cannot tell people how many children to have but taxpayers will be rightly outraged at stories of such irresponsible behaviour while hard-pressed families cut corners to make ends meet.

"Culprit? Royal surgeon Sir John Williams has been named as Jack the Ripper by a descendant of one of the serial killer's victims . A second book has named Queen Victoria's surgeon Sir John Williams as the infamous Jack the Ripper - and it is written by a descendant of one of the serial killer's victims. Author Antonia Alexander claims she is the great-great-great-granddaughter of the Ripper's fifth and final victim Mary Kelly. She points the finger at Sir John, who founded the National Library of Wales, in Aberystwyth, and acted as surgeon for the royal family. It follows a book released last year by Tony Williams, the great-great nephew of Sir John, who also accuses the prominent surgeon of being behind the notorious killings on the cobbled streets of London's Whitechapel in 1888. Ms Alexander's investigation started after she discovered a photograph of a man in a 125-year-old locket contained in Mary's belongings was not of the victim's husband - as she had initially believed - but of Sir John. 'It's part of our family history that Mary had an affair for a number of years with a doctor who had taken her to places like Paris,' said the mother-of-two, who released her book The Fifth Victim earlier this month. 'But the doctor married someone else and Mary also got married so everyone believed the photo in the locket was of her husband. 'But my research has shown she was in fact carrying around the photo of her lover, Sir John Williams.' Descendant: Author Antonia Alexander claims she is the great-great-great-granddaughter of the Ripper's fifth and final victim Mary Kelly. She points the finger at Sir John, who founded the National Library of Wales, in Aberystwyth . Born in Gwynfe, Carmarthenshire in 1840, Sir John trained as a doctor in London, working at a number of institutions. He had a surgery in Whitechapel at the time of the Ripper killings, which claimed the lives of at least five women. A life-long collector of Welsh books and manuscripts, he was the principle founder of the National Library of Wales, living at a house called Blaenllynant in Victoria Terrace on Aberystwyth's seafront, which is now the Glengower Hotel, until his death in 1926. Victim: An illustration of Mary Kelly shortly after she was murdered by Jack the Ripper. She was about 25 years old at the time of her death . In his book Uncle Jack: A Victorian Mystery, Tony Williams argues that the Welsh surgeon had the medical knowledge to remove vital organs from the victims; that he knew the victims from clinics he ran in Whitechapel, and that pages of his 1888 diary have been removed while other diaries are intact. He also claimed that Sir John had been . devastated he and his Swansea-born wife Lizzie could not have children . and was desperate to find methods to increase fertility. During . the Whitechapel murder spree, the Ripper killed women and removed their . sexual and internal organs with surgical precision. 'The uterus were removed from the . victims, and I believe John Williams wanted to understand the function . of the ovaries, their relation to fertility and to see if he could use . the organs he removed from the women to complete his research,' said Mr . Williams. Evidence: Ms Alexander's investigation started after she discovered a photograph of a man in a 125-year-old locket (pictured) contained in Mary's belongings was that of the victim's husband, but one of Sir John . 'He retired from practice in 1903, so why did he keep the surgical knife and glass slides among the personal possessions he left in the library?' Montague John Druitt, Dorset-born barrister, committed suicide in the Thames shortly after last murderSeweryn Kłosowski alias George Chapman,  poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903Aaron Kosminski, suspected by police, admitted to Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum and died thereDr Thomas Neill Cream, poisoned four London prostitutes with strychnine and was hangedSir William Withey Gull, royal physician named as a member of a masonic conspiracy . When . the killings suddenly stopped, Sir John is claimed to have told friends he'd had a nervous . breakdown and retired from London life - moving to Aberystwyth in West . Wales. Mr Williams has . uncovered documents showing his ancestor carried out an abortion in 1885 . on Mary Ann Nichols - who later became the Ripper's first victim. Mr . Williams even discovered a letter sent by Sir John in 1888 in which he . apologises for canceling an evening dinner appointment on September 8 . because he had to go to a clinic in Whitechapel. That was the date the Ripper's second victim Annie Chapman was murdered. He also matched a knife in Sir John's collection with the pathologist's description of the murder weapon and found that three medical slides from Sir John's collection contained smears from a human uterus. Ms Alexander said: 'My book centres on the ultimately tragic romance Mary had with Sir John Williams. Allegations: Miss Alexander's claims follow Tony Williams' (pictured) book Uncle Jack: A Victorian Mystery . Notorious: An illustration published in the Police Gazette in 1888 depicting Jack the Ripper attacking a woman . 'It was a great shock when we found the photo in Mary's locket was that of Sir John. 'It proves the relationship between them.' The true identity of the Ripper has never been known, with the list of suspects nearly 100-long. They include the Duke of Clarence, the grandson of the then-reigning monarch Queen Victoria, who is alleged to have learned disembowelling techniques on deer. Montague John Druitt, a barrister and 'gentleman of good family' wasn't suspected until 1959, when Sir Melville Macnaghten's case notes described him as 'sexually insane'. It was reported that 'even his own family suspected him of being the Whitechapel Murderer'. Druitt committed suicide in 1888, drowning himself in the Thames with pockets full of stones.

"A white teenage mother was stabbed to death and her body dumped in a canal after her married Asian lover rejected her child, a court heard yesterday. Student Laura Wilson, 17, was killed by 18-year-old Ashtiaq Asghar, having allegedly been lured alone to the canal by his friend and her former lover Ishaq Hussain, Sheffield Crown Court heard. Laura had a brief fling with near neighbour Hussain, 22, and gave birth to their daughter in June last year but he refused to accept the child was his, the court was told. Laura Wilson had a brief fling with near neighbour Ishaq Hussain, 22, and gave birth to their daughter in June last year but he refused to accept the child was his, the court was told . Laura was killed last October only three days after she revealed to the families of Hussain and Asghar that she had had affairs with both men who were trying to keep it secret. Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell QC said the men mounted a 'mission to kill Laura Wilson' and even adopted the language of the cult British film 'Four Lions' about Islamic terrorists in the UK. Ashtiaq Asghar (pictured) admitted killing Laura Wilson in May this year and will be sentenced after the end of the trial of Hussain, who denies murder . Asghar admitted Laura's murder in May this year and will be sentenced after the end of the trial of Hussain, who denies murder. Mr Campbell told the jury that Hussain was 'jointly responsible' for Laura's murder. The court heard he failed to acknowledge Laura's baby and Asghar was equally keen that his family did not know about his affair with a white girl. Laura, fed up with all the secrecy, went to tell the families of both men of her affairs with their sons. Afterwards Hussain and Asghar allegedly sent a flurry of texts to one another. In the language used by terrorists in the 'Four Lions' film Asghar is said to have sent a text to Hussain the day before Laura died which read: 'I'm gonna send that kaffir b**** straight to hell.' They even talked about buying a 9.6mm 'shooter' for £400 and Asghar boasted about bringing his 'hit list' out. In fact, said Mr Campbell, the murder weapon of choice turned out to be a knife, with Asghar texting Hussain: 'I need to do a mission.' In more language from the film Asghar allegedly said he was going to 'make beans on toast', a reference to the carnage after a terrorist bomb blast. Mr Campbell said the comment meant the 'spilling of blood' and when the pair talked about 'unbelieving kaffir bastards' - non Muslims - they were clearly referring to the 'mission' to kill Laura. Mr Campbell said Hussain and Asghar were angry that Laura had brought trouble to the door of their families. He said: 'She was a loose cannon and they had decided to get rid of her.' The teenager's body was found in this canal in Rotherham, Yorkshire . The teenager went missing from her home in Holmes, Rotherham in October last year and her body, which had been stabbed repeatedly, was found in the Sheffield and Keadby Canal near Rotherham. The prosecution say it is likely Asghar killed her when he had a 'golden opportunity' while she was alone, after Hussain lured her friend away. Before the affair with Hussain, Laura had fallen in love with Asghar and they resumed the affair after Laura had the baby. Mr Campbell described Laura as 'embracing life with gusto and she was an attractive and popular girl'. She became friendly with Faye William who also had a baby daughter with Hussain. They both realised Hussain would never marry them but Laura was only really interested in Asghar, Mr Campbell said. After Hussain refused to acknowledge and support Laura's baby she became more angry as he tried to keep the lovechild a secret and she believed Asghar was seeing another girl. Laura eventually took matters into her own hands and went to see the Asghar and Hussain families. Laura told Asghar's mother she loved her son and 'wanted to have babies' by him but the mother became angry, called her a 'dirty white bitch' and hit Laura with a shoe. She then saw Hussain's family and told them she had given birth to his baby but they were dismissive. 'Her actions that night brought the truth to both of their front doors and they had some explaining to do to their families,' said Mr Campbell. The trial continues.

"This huge carp has literally taken the bait again after it was caught by the same angler, 14 years after their first encounter. Angler Tim Cosens was surprised to see an ‘old friend’ on the end of his fishing reel when he caught the same common carp at Strawberry Fields fishery in Tunbridge Wells, Kent that he had reeled in back in 1999. Photographed with the impressive 26lbs carp back then, Mr Cosens posed for the same picture with the same fish, now doubled in size - a huge 54lbs 12ozs. An 'old friend' takes the bait again: Angler Tim Cosens poses with the same common carp he caught back in 1999 which has since doubled in size . While the keen angler has fished elsewhere since his 1999 catch, he returned to the lake and cast his rod from the same spot, hoping for similar success. After three hours, he got just that when he felt a nibble. He spent the next 40 minutes reeling in the carp only to discover that the fish had the same distinctive bald patch halfway down one side as his previous catch, 14 years before. Mr Cosens, a builder, said: ‘I used to fish at the lake years ago but moved on to somewhere else after I had caught most of the carp in there. ‘I decided to pop back recently and returned to the same swim where I first caught the carp at 26lbs 14 years ago. The first catch: When he caught the fish back in 1999 it weighed 26lbs. He noticed it had a distinctive bald patch halfway down one side, the very same unique mark he recognised on the carp he caught recently . ‘I was there for three hours when I had some luck but it wasn't until I got the fish into the net that I saw its bald patch on one side. ‘It was a big fish back then and it's obviously even bigger now. ‘I was really chuffed because at 54lbs it was a personal best catch for me. It was nice seeing the same fish again, like meeting up with an old friend.’ Mr Cosens returned the carp, which is estimated to be about 20-years-old, back into the water after their reunion. It was caught at the 1.5 acre fishery which is home to more than 150 fish.","Angler Tim Cosens caught the same common carp he caught back in 1999 .

"It was a conversion that would make even the hardiest property developers shudder. Made to resist a bomb - let alone a drill - this was nothing like your average makeover. But once Elizabeth Strutton set eyes on the former World War II bunker, she was itching to give it a go. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fortress: Liz Strutton outside the front of her home in St Leven, Cornwall, a converted WW2 bunker . World War II listening post: From the outside the bunker looks like it has barely changed - but the interior has undergone a complete transformation . After the war the shelter lay derelict for decades - only used by a farmer for his potatoes - until Ms Strutton saw it in a Penzance estate agent's window . Set on the cliffs of Land's End in Cornwall, the secluded tunnel, built in 1942, was used to find out about enemy activity. This included discovering information about enemy patrols, wiring parties, or sniper positions and relaying them to pilots and commanders. It was a notoriously dangerous place to be as Germans would target any 'sap-heads', as they called these dugouts, to stop them interfering. In this particular dugout, workers are said to have been protecting the nearby cable tower - though many facts are still classified until 100 years after they were filed. After the war the shelter lay derelict for decades - only used by a farmer for his potatoes - until Ms Strutton saw it in a Penzance estate agent's window. Liz Strutton on the roof of her home in St Leven, Cornwall, with her sun vent and her satellite . Transformed: Liz Strutton spent years working on the heavy duty concrete to turn it into her ideal home . Ms Strutton describes the bunker as 'paradise' saying the property which has no windows is 'a magical fortress' A room with a view: There is a panoramic view of the surrounding fields and cliffs standing on top of the roof . Having bought it for £143,000, Ms Strutton needed to spend five years and £100,000 making . the necessary changes. Now it is a fully functioning family home. The three-bed bungalow has two bathrooms and a wet room. A 23ft open plan living area, with a kitchen and lounge, is lit by purpose-built sun tubes that poke through the sturdy ceiling. Beyond her private drive and large garden, with a garage and shed, Ms Strutton can peer over the open countryside. Secluded: the dugout used to spy on the skies and protect our vital cable tower was purposely difficult to find . Buried: The bunker under grass and shrubs before work began. The builders had never seen anything like it . The bedroom was once an air circulation unit ventilating the hideout, which was manned 24 hours a day . The bunker had been untouched for years when Ms Strutton, 42, began construction on it . It is secluded, with no windows, but Ms Strutton, 42, calls it paradise. 'It is a magical fortress,' said Ms Strutton, who lives in the sentinel with her two Basset Hounds and a German Shepherd. 'You are at the end of the world and living history. 'You . don't know what you're letting yourself in for when you take this kind . of thing on, but I know I live in the best place in the world now. Still the same: Despite the orange walls, modern lights, and carpeting, a veteran recognised the exact lay out . You can hardly imagine the scenes in 1942 as men and women sat here frantically protecting Britain's borders . Former property developer Ms Strutton was planning to renovate and move on but the market crashed . 'We . get a lot of family and friends visiting. Because of where it is and . what it is, it's quite a novelty. Kids love it and blokes love it . because they never grow up really. 'Sometimes it's worth going over the top for something.' A former property developer, Ms Strutton, 42, had been planning to renovate and move on when she bought the dugout in 2007. But when the market crashed, she was forced to sell up her normal, more marketable home and settle in the 1942-built war den. It . took more than a month to get through the concrete roof to fit an . emergency fire sprinkler - needed to make up for the lack of windows and . fire escapes. And hidden under a three-foot mound of soil, the whole place had to be insulated to curb any damp. Modern: Despite the change of plan it is now a perfect home - clean, clear and stylish, with no trace of dust . Thanks to the nearby Porthcurno BT tower, Liz Strutton has perfect wireless connection in her secluded paradise . What is now the bedroom was once filled with an air circulation unit. The hallway was a tunnel to another bunker. Ms Strutton, now a jewellery maker, said: 'Really it was a blessing in disguise. But it has taken years to make it right. A mammoth project: It has taken five years and £100,000 to shape this den into perfection . 'It was always just a holiday home and always on the market. 'At first it was just an unmissable opportunity - this is like the highlight of someone's career. I was always going to move on and continue with the business. 'Then the crash happened and I was stuck. It was very poor timing. 'I had other properties - three-bed semis - that I would have lived in. But in an economic crisis those are far more sellable. 'The building process was very difficult. 'It hasn't been done before so the builders weren't used to this kind of space. It took much longer and much more money than expected.' Despite the changes - orange walls, cable TV - it still looks exactly the same as the bunker intelligence officials used to protect Britain's essential cable station in nearby Porthcurno. And there is no shortage of interest from scholars and veterans wanting a peek around. 'We have had a lot of interest,' Ms Strutton explained, 'a man studying bunkers of that era came round and I learned a lot about my home that I never knew. 'Amazingly, the family of a veteran came down the other week. They said their mum now has dementia but told them she worked here during the war. Sleek: One of the two bathrooms. They are now colourful, sleek and stylish despite being built in 1942 . Colourful: The house has more style to it than veterans will remember of their 1940's sentinel . 'They didn't believe her but once they were in, it was exactly as she had described it. 'Their mother was very happy about it apparently, and it was so interesting for me to hear. 'Living in here you do really appreciate the way people fought - you feel a sort of connection with what they were doing. It is something I don't want to take for granted and one of the best things about the place.' Reluctantly selling up to be closer to work, Ms Strutton's historical abode is on the market for £275,000 with Miller&Son. Ms Strutton added: 'Sometimes you do have to move on, but really I could live here forever. It is beautiful and special.'","Former listening post in St Leven, Cornwall, was manned 24 hours a day .

"South Korea has released pictures of a small rudimentary drone that landed on its soil in what is believed to be a bungled reconnaissance mission from North Korea. The wreckage - that looks more like a remote-controlled toy aeroplane than a piece of military hardware - was reported on April 3 after it was found by a 53-year-old wild ginseng digger. It is one of three which crashed on South Korean soil in the past fortnight, sparking fears that Kim Jong-Un's dictatorship could adapt the technology for terror attacks. Scroll down for video . Earlier this week South Korea released pictures of one of the small rudimentary drones found on a mountain in Samcheok, South Korea . North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (second from the right) looks at small drones in an image captured from a documentary that aired on Korean Central Television on June 16, 2013 . The latest unmanned aircraft was found in mountains near Samcheok, in South Korea's Gangwon Province. One had crashed in Paju, a city near the border with North Korea, on March 24. The other crashed on the island of Baengnyeong. The captured drones were basic, at best, South Korean experts told Hani.co.kr, but they if improved they could be used for terrorist attacks. The latest to crash was equipped with  Japanese-made Canon cameras available on the internet for just a few hundred pounds. The Paju drone was also equipped with a Canon camera and the other one carried a Nikon camera. All three were painted sky blue and probably cost only a few thousand dollars to build. The two earlier drones were smaller, 55in wide by 71in long. The drone was 4ft long with a 6ft wingspan and weighed 15kg . The drone was equipped with Japanese-made cameras available on the internet for just a few hundred pounds . Officials said lettering on the . battery of the drone found at Paju and other forensic evidence suggest . it was of North Korean origin and it had enough fuel to return to North . Korea. In June last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un was filmed looking at small . drones in an image captured from a documentary that aired on Korean . Central Television. According to the military, the third . drone was 4ft long with a 6ft wingspan and weighed 15kg. The site was . approximately 130km from the Military Demarcation Line, making this the . farthest south of the armistice line of any suspected North Korean . drones found to date. Ministry . of National Defense spokesman Kim Min-seok said the military was sent to the site where the . small drone was found after a report was received from a local resident. 'The location was 940 meters above sea level in the area of Cheongok Mountain in Samcheok's Hajang Township,' Kim said. 'The UAV was confirmed to be the same type as the triangular, sky-blue miniature UAV found in Paju,' he added. The camera's memory chip contained photographs, but these were no longer available after the man, called Lee, erased the device for personal use, the military reported. This reconnaissance picture shows an aerial view of Seoul's Jichuk Station: The discovery has prompted fears that South Korea's air defences are not up to the job of in the new era of drone warfare . Spying: This undated handout picture provided by the South Korean Defence Ministry shows an aerial image of Eunpyung New Town, Seoul, from a camera on the unmanned North Korean drone which crashed in Paju . Rudimentary: A suspected North Korean reconnaissance drone found near Paju . A military official quoted Lee as recalling that images of Donggwang Lake (near Samcheok) and coastal regions were present before the data was erased. However hundreds of images were found on the drone found at Paju, including the South Korean president's compound in Seoul. Security has been stepped up at the Blue . House in Seoul, the official residence of current President Park . Guen-hye and location of a 1968 assassination attempt by Pyongyang . against the then South Korean leader, since the discovery. The discovery has sparked fears that Kim Jong-Un's dictatorship could adapt the technology for terror attacks . The Ministry of National Defense said it plans to hold a meeting of major general commanders today to assess the security situation and present detailed guidelines for a firm response. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also plans to hold simultaneous reconnaissance patrols for all its units this week in case additional North Korean drones were deployed. 'If North Korea is determined to be responsible, we plan to respond sternly and in various ways, including possible legal action for the violation of our airspace,' said Kwon Oh-han, an Army major general and director of the JCS operational bureau. Meanwhile, North Korea made its first public mention of the drone controversy on April 5, twelve days after the discovery of the Paju drone was reported in the press on Mar. 25. But the statement neither confirmed nor denied South Korean authorities' claims of North Korea's responsibility for the drones. While criticising a recent missile test launch by South Korea, the statement from a North Korean strategic forces spokesman said Seoul had 'further damaged its already rock-bottom dignity with an out-of-nowhere drone situation.' It went on to say that 'unidentified drones were flying freely around downtown Seoul, including the Blue House and Gyeongbok Palace areas, and blithely traveling the skies over where Baengnyeong Island was being pummeled.'","Drone is one of three which crashed in the past fortnight .

"Mankind is on the brink of 'committing suicide on a grand scale' unless rapid progress is made on green issues, the Prince of Wales warned today. In very strong language, Prince Charles claimed the planet was doomed to an 'unimaginable future' if the problems of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere, intensive farming using pesticides and the depletion of natural resources were not addressed. The Prince, often accused of using his position to influence public policy, is usually tempered when giving his views about the environment. Scroll down for video of his speech . Sweet smell of success: The prince sniffs a piece of chocolate used as feedstock to create gas at the Anaerobic Digester  Plant in Dorchester . But in an apocalyptic warning of the toxic planet facing future generations, he claimed the world was heading towards a 'terrifying point of no return'. Letters: Prince Charles has often written to ministers and Whitehall departments . In a swipe at critics of his green views, he said he had once been written off as 'a crank', but now his fears for the environment have been backed by scientific evidence. His comments came in a pre-recorded video speech accepting a lifetime achievement award at the  7th International Green Awards at Battersea Power Station in London. He told the ceremony that fossil fuels and supplies of fresh water were under pressure while 'vast amounts of CO2' were still pumped into the atmosphere. The Prince said: 'Humanity and the Earth will soon begin to suffer some very grim consequence. 'It’s therefore an act of suicide on a grand scale to ride so roughshod over those checks and balances and flout nature’s necessary limits as blatantly as we do. “The longer we go on ignoring what is already happening and denying what will happen in the future, the more profoundly we condemn our grandchildren and their children to an unbearably toxic and unstable existence. We simply have to turn the tide.' Speaking of his early warnings of the environmental threats to the planet he said the lifetime achievement award was an acknowledgement for what he described as his 'rather inadequate efforts' to create change. He added: 'All those years ago when I began to . see that this could be so, I found myself labelled with every term that . describes a crank. “I . don’t actually recommend it as a pastime but, extraordinary as it may . seem, nowadays … that intuitive feeling has been backed up by a mass of . scientific evidence in every possible field confirming that our . predominant approach is having a very adverse effect on nature.' Over the years, the Prince has courted controversy because of his involvement in public affairs - writing to councils and government ministers with his views ranging from architecture to alternative medicine. The government has blocked the release of secret letters Prince of Wales wrote to ministers because they would 'seriously damage' his political neutrality and his role as future king. The letters were requested under the Freedom of Information Act, but yesterday the attorney general stopped the release saying they were 'particularly frank' and . would 'potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality' if published. He added . that any suggestion he was 'disagreeing with government policy' would . be 'seriously damaging to his role as future monarch'. The High Court had previously ruled that . two dozen ‘black spider’ letters – which Charles sent during . the last Labour government – should be revealed. A . judge said it was in the public interest to release the letters, which . were described in court as ‘advocacy correspondence’ through which the . Prince of Wales had sought to influence government policy. But yesterday the Government’s chief legal officer overturned the ruling. Last month the government blocked the release of secret letters Prince Charles wrote to ministers because they would 'seriously damage' his political neutrality and his role as future king. The letters were requested under the Freedom of Information Act, but the Attorney General Dominic Grieve stopped the release saying they were 'particularly frank' and would 'potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality' if published. The High Court had previously ruled that two dozen ‘black spider’ letters – which Charles sent during the last Labour government – should be revealed. A judge said it was in the public interest to release the letters, which were described in court as ‘advocacy correspondence’ through which the Prince of Wales had sought to influence government policy. In 2009, he was accused of meddling in government policy after it emerged he had written to eight Whitehall departments in three years. He sent personal letters to the Treasury, the Foreign Office and the Education Department – while his aides sent letters to other senior Cabinet members. Freedom of Information requests revealed advisers to the Prince pressed ministers to consider his views on matters including hospital building and the design of ecotowns . His most public intervention came in 2010 over a £3 billion scheme to redevelop the Chelsea Royal Barracks by the Qataris. The project was axed after the Prince lobbied the Prime Minister of Qatar claiming it was a 'gigantic experiment with the very soul of our city'. Dr Benny Peiser, director of Lord Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation, told the Independent that the Prince’s views were still out of step with mainstream thinking.","He claims world is heading towards 'terrifying point of no return'

"The United States has been fighting the wrong war against the wrong enemy these past 13-years according to a damning new book - while behind closed doors Pakistan has been laughing in its ally's face. Pullitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Carlotta Gall claims that not only did Pakistan willfully hide 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden but also sponsored the Taliban insurgency after 2001 that has cost 2,625 American and British lives. The respected reporter, who spent more than a decade in the region for the newspaper, alleges that Pakistan's leadership have been tricking the United States into treating it as a friend for decades. Did they know all along? Osama Bin Laden watching himself on TV in his hideout before the dramatic raid that ended with his death in May 2011 . 'Pakistan did know,' Gall said to ABC News, speaking about bin Laden’s location. 'They were hiding him, they were handling him. Someone on the inside told me this. They had a special desk that knew where bin Laden was. 'Not only that, but put him there, protected him, oversaw him, handled him in the terms of the secret intelligence services,' she added. 'And it's all deniable, but I’m told the top bosses knew.' Terror: Smoke pours from the World Trade Center after it was hit by two hijacjked passenger planes on September 11, 2001 in New York City . Friends? President George W. Bush (L) and Pakistan's President Pervez Musharaf pictured in September, 2004 for a private bi-lateral breakfast meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York . Gall also makes the allegation that bin Laden's number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is most probably being provided with safe haven by Pakistan. 'Our relations with Pakistan have gone back to the same thing, and the thing that concerns me is that Zawahiri is still out there, in Pakistan, I believe,' she said. 'He is also probably being hidden the same way and protected.' Gall spoke to ABC News about her book, 'The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014' and expanded on her claims of a duplicitous Pakistan. Conspired: A multiple explosion rocks al-Qaeda positions in the Tora Bora mountains after an attack by US warplanes, 14 December 2001, from which Osama bin Laden allegedly escaped . 'Instead of fighting a very grim and tough war which was very high in casualties on Afghans, as well as NATO and American soldiers, the problem wasn't in the Afghan villages,' Gall said. 'The source of the problem, the radicalization, the sponsoring of the insurgency, was all happening in Pakistan.' Gall told ABC News that she realized 'very soon' after 9/11 that Pakistan was to blame for the Taliban in Afghanistan. 'I went to Quetta and found Taliban resting up there and regrouping,' she said. Assistance: Afghan anti-Taliban fighters sits around a Russian T-55 tank while two bombs explodes following an attack by US B-52 bombers on Al Qaeda position in Tora Bora on 10 December 2001 . Pakistani police, media personel and local residents gather outside a burnt compound at the hideout of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden following his death by US Special Forces in a ground operation in Abbottabad on May 3, 2011 . 'They had assistance, some of them talked about being forced and threatened and told to go in and fight the Americans … and when you're there, on the ground, seeing every bombing, the suicide bombing had started, the insurgency that grew, and you investigate where it's coming from, it kept leading back to Pakistan.' According to Gall, Pakistan's leaders, particularly President Pervez Musharraf. were 'very clever' as they hoodwinked successive administrations from Clinton to Bush. 'I think the politicians, not all of them, but the diplomats … it took ages for them to understand that actually the persuasion wasn't working; the engagement wasn't bringing them on board; they were actually double dealing,' she said. 'And now diplomats will tell you very plainly, ‘Yes, Musharraf was double dealing.'","New York Times reporter makes startling claims that Pakistan has been playing both sides since 9/11 .

"Mia Love has made history in Utah after becoming the first black Republican woman to be elected to United States Congress. The former Mayor of Saratoga Springs defeated her Democratic opponent Doug Owens in the race to represent Utah's 4th congressional district late last night. During her victory speech, Love said 'there is great cause for confidence' as she runs with Utahns towards the 'challenges of our time'. Mia Love has made history in Utah after becoming the first black Republican woman to be elected to  Congress . Owens tweeted at 11:25 p.m. that he had called Love to concede the race. His campaign manager told Fox 13 News  that Love won the race  by a margin of 50 per cent to 46 per cent. 'Thank you for the trust you have placed in me,' Love said in a statement. 'I will work every day to be deserving of it. 'Regardless of who you voted for today, I hope you know that I am going to Washington to represent everyone in the district and invite you to engage with me in finding real solutions to the challenges we face as a country.' The Republican also pledged to 'work every day to keep the federal government out of your lives, out of your pockets, and out of your way so you can run toward your own American Dream'. Love pledged to Utahns that she would 'work every day to keep the federal government out of your lives' Democrat Doug Owens said he felt 'at peace' with the result and was proud of his staff's efforts, but added that he felt in the end low voter turn out might have made the difference . She said: 'Many people have reminded me that tonight is not the end of the race; it is just the end of the beginning,' 'As your representative, I am not going to ask you to trust Washington - I am going to convince Washington to trust you.

Love, a Haitian-American, failed in her first attempt to win a congressional seat in 2012, losing to a Democratic incumbent by just 768 votes out of more than 245 cast. Owens told KUER that he felt 'at peace' with the result and was proud of his staff's efforts, but added that he felt in the end  low voter turn out might have made the difference. 'I had a good feeling going in and obviously I would rather the outcome have been different, but I feel at peace about it. I feel good about it. We'll be back. We're not done yet,' he said . Love was riding a wave of GOP victory that saw Republicans consolidate their power on Capitol Hill, picking up more seats than they needed to gain control of the US Senate. Their triumphs included key wins in Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, North Carolina and Iowa, all seats controlled by Democrats when the day began. 'The American people have put their trust in the Republican Party, sending a GOP majority to the U.S. Senate,' said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus. 'Our party's principles and message resonated with voters across the country. This was a rejection of President Obama's failed polices and Harry Reid's dysfunctional Senate.' 'Republicans have been given the opportunity to lead the country in a better direction, and the Republican House and Senate are ready to listen to the American people. We hope President Obama will too.' Love said 'there is great cause for confidence' as she runs with Utahns towards the 'challenges of our time' Democrat candidate Doug Owens tweeted at 11:25 p.m. that he had called Love to concede the race . 'It's time to get to work on creating jobs, expanding American energy development, pursuing real healthcare reform, reducing spending, reining in the federal government, and keeping America safe.' Love told her supporters that she was proud to be a part of a surge of Republican support, KUER reported. 'This election is historic because it has raised Utah's voice and we have boldly told congress that the status quo will not work. Above all, this election is about remembering our history, reclaiming our freedom and reshaping our future,' she said.

"David Cameron today hit back at Lib Dem calls for drugs to be decriminalised – claiming it would encourage children to get hooked. The Prime Minister said he did not want to send a message to youngsters than taking drugs was okay. He said: ‘Frankly, it isn’t.’ It comes after the Lib Dems jumped on a landmark Home Office report which claimed punishing substance abuse had no impact on the number of people getting addicted. MPs, also backed a motion today calling for the Government to overhaul Britain’s ‘failing’ drug laws. The Prime Minister said he did not want to send a message to youngsters than taking drugs was okay. But Nick Clegg (right) said giving drug addicts criminal records was 'helping the real criminals' - the dealers . David Cameron held a PM Direct at an O2 Call Centre in Runcorn, Cheshire, today - in which he rejected calls for drugs to be decriminalised . But the Prime Minister, speaking at an O2 call centre in Preston Brook, Cheshire, said the Government’s drugs policies were working. He said: ‘What we are doing is working. I don't believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today. ‘I'm a parent with three children - I don't want to send out a message that somehow taking these drugs is OK and safe because, frankly, it isn't.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘And frankly I think one of the biggest problems we have got right now is the problem of so-called legal highs, drugs are being sold openly which can have real dangers, for particularly young people and I want to see us have tougher powers so that we ban these legal highs, take them off the high streets and protect more of our young people.’ But the Lib Dems said treating drug addicts as criminals was ‘nonsensical’ and did nothing to cut down abuse. Mr Clegg said giving drug addicts criminal records was 'helping the real criminals' - the dealers. Home Office minister Norman Baker said a landmark new report published by the Home Office showed tough anti drug laws did not work and need to be scrapped. He said taking drugs should be decriminalised like in Portugal where even heroin and cocaine are not banned. It comes after a Home Office report found that decriminalising deadly narcotics would not lead to more Britons taking them – and that tough anti-drugs laws do not work. The report was led by Norman Baker (pictured), a Liberal Democrat home office minister, and looked at how other countries tackle drug use - it concluded that tough anti-drugs law do not work . The 55-page report on how other countries tackle drug use – spearheaded by Mr Baker – was released along with another Home Office report on how to deal with dangerous ‘legal highs’ being sold on the High Street. Speaking this morning Mr Baker said: ‘There is no correlation between the toughness of a country's penalty regime and the amount of drug use in that country.’ He added: ‘We’ve had what I would call mindless rhetoric over the last forty years which has tended to say there's only one solution and anyone who offers any alternative must by definition be ""soft on drugs"".' Mr Baker said the Government study showed 'there's no correlation between the toughness of a particular government's response to drugs in terms of the penalties applicable and the level of drug use in that country'. He said: ‘It also shows for example that in Portugal, where the question of drugs is treated as a health matter rather than a criminal one, that's been effective both at getting people off drugs and therefore reducing drug use. So I think we do have to look at the evidence. ‘Locking somebody up in prison for a matter of weeks because they happen to possess a Class B or a Class C drug is a nonsensical approach. It doesn't change their attitude.’ Earlier this month Mr Baker accused No10 of sitting on the reports since July and blamed the Conservatives for blocking their release for ‘political reasons’. The report on drug use abroad involved Liberal Democrat ministers embarking on a £40,000 international drug law fact-finding mission. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today accused the Tories of being 'frightened' of decriminalising drugs . It has sparked a row within the Coalition as the Tories reject its findings and vow ‘never’ to decriminalise drugs – while the Liberal Democrats say drug addicts should ‘be helped to recover rather than put behind bars’. The report said: ‘It is not clear that decriminalisation has an impact on levels of drug use. Looking across different countries, there is no apparent correlation between the “toughness” of a country’s approach and the prevalence of adult drug use.’ The findings are likely to add to calls from the Lib Dems to scrap jail terms for possession of drugs for personal use – a move certain to infuriate Tories. Earlier this year, Mr Clegg pledged to abolish prison terms for the possession of drugs for personal use, including Class A substances. However, a Home Office source said: ‘The Lib Dems have blown £40,000 of taxpayers’ money on a magical mystery tour around the world looking at countries with soft drugs laws. ‘But whatever they now say they want, we will never allow decriminalisation to happen.’ Mary Brett, of anti-drugs pressure group Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘Of course decriminalisation would lead to more drug use. There would be an upsurge and a corresponding upsurge in crime, people suffering mental health problems and deaths.’ The report has put the Coalition on a collision path - with the Tories vowing to 'never' decriminalise drugs . The report is especially concerning because it comes just weeks after a definitive study into the effects of long-term cannabis smoking destroyed the argument that the drug is safe. Instead, the research paper, by a drugs adviser to the World Health Organisation, concluded cannabis is highly addictive, causes mental health problems and opens the door to hard drugs use. The Home Office said it was considering a blanket ban on the sale of ‘legal highs’ being sold on the High Street. The drugs, which mimic the effect of illegal substances such as ecstasy and cocaine, are no longer the preserve of specialist ‘head shops’, and are now widely for sale in takeaways, petrol stations, newsagents and even pet shops. Recently released figures show there were 60 deaths related to legal highs last year – up from 52 in 2012 and 29 in 2011.","Home Office report says that tough anti-drugs laws do not work .

"Thieves have taken off with the ten metre high Big Mango from a fruit-growing town in northern Queensland, Australia. The giant, bright orange replica of the famous Bowen mango is one of Australia's iconic tourist attractions, and was the pride of Bowen, before a team of robbers took off with it under the cover of darkness in the early hours of Monday. Security cameras appear to have captured the heist, in which the three-story painted metal mango was unbolted from the concrete platform on which it had stood since 2002, rolled on to a heavy vehicle and driven off down Queensland's Bruce Highway. However, doubts have begun to emerge about the heist. Queensland police say the theft has not been reported to them, although Bowen Tourism is still insisting the icon is missing, and it is not a publicity stunt. Fruit loops: thieves took off with the Big Mango (above), a ten metre high tourist attraction from the Queensland town of Bowen. Police are examining clues, but a sighting suggests the stolen icon is on a large, unmarked crane heading south . Security footage shows an apparently masked thief on the premises near the Big Mango moving towards a large, unmarked crane, which Bowen police now believe may be the getaway vehicle . The daring heist happened in the early hours of Monday morning, when the thief (above, in the right of the picture) and an accomplice unbolted the Big Mango from its concrete base and shifted the 10 tonne tourism icon onto a crane . Whoever removed the Big Mango was very well organised. Tyre marks and a reported sighting suggest the Big Mango is on a large, unmarked mobile crane heading south. For the last 12 years, the Big Mango had sat towing the Bowen tourist centre, four kilometres out of town. Although CCTV was installed to protect the tourist office from break-ins, no-one suspected anyone would take off with the orange fruit icon. In the rear light of the giant crane, one of the thieves can be seen signalling to the crane's driver as the vehicle eases the Big Mango from its moorings . The CCTV footage of the alleged robbery (above) is being studied by police, along with tyre marks and a sighting of the vehicle heading south . Locals in the northern Queensland town of Bowen are at a loss as to what motives the Big Mango thieves had for stealing the pride of Bowen in the middle of the night . 'No one in their right mind considered for a second that someone would take a giant three-storey-high, 10-tonne Mango,' Bowen Tourism chairman Paul McLaughlin told The Courier Mail. 'It’s not like it’s something that can be easily hidden. The Big Mango was the work of local Bowen doctor, Geoff Ingham, who established a Big Mango Trust in the late 1990s to help fund and build it. The Mango went up in 2002 at a cost of $90,000, 200 per cent over budget. Mr McLaughlin said he hoped the iconic tourist attraction would be returned unharmed, and with the help of the tyre marks and the security footage, police would soon unmask the thieves. He said local authorities were analysing the security footage for leads. Bowen Tourist Information Centre manager Christin Short was the first to notice when he arrived at work this morning – and assumed the Big Mango it must have been removed for repairs. But a call to Mr McLaughlin confirmed there was no planned maintenance – and an inspection found the mango had indeed been unbolted and stolen. Motives for the theft remain unclear.","Giant Australian tourist attraction stolen in the dead of night .

"Tragic: Connor Donaldson died in hospital after suffering a severe allergic reaction to a prawn balti takeaway . A 12-year-old Manchester United fan died of a severe allergic reaction to a takeaway curry despite staff assuring his family the dish contained no nuts. Moments after taking his first few bites of prawn balti, ordered from the Tyldesley Tandoori restaurant in Greater Manchester, Connor Donaldson started to gasp for breath as he suffered a severe asthma attack. His mother Sarah Donaldson, who also suffers from a nut allergy, had told staff when ordering the takeaway that her meal must not contain any trace of nuts. But investigations launched after Connor's death revealed kitchen staff had been using the same ladles and spoons to serve all food, an inquest heard. The curry was also found to contain balti paste, which contained traces of nuts. In addition the takeaway used almond powder in dishes, which contained 50 per cent peanut powder as suppliers sought to supplement the expensive ingredient with a cheaper nut. Mrs Donaldson, giving evidence at an inquest held in Bolton, said she had been diagnosed with asthma, hayfever, eczema and a nut allergy at a young age. She said while Connor had been diagnosed with asthma, hayfever and eczema, he had never formally been diagnosed with a nut allergy. 'As he had three of the four conditions I had I took it as read he would have a nut allergy and I treated him accordingly,' she said. 'I was always careful to ensure he never came into contact with any food with nuts in. He never had Chinese food and would not eat any sweets or confectionery which may contain nuts. 'From an early age he was self-disciplining and made sure he didn’t eat those products. 'Apart from a broken leg when he was nine he was happy and healthy although he would sometimes suffer from his asthma when he played football. 'They would stop the game so he could use his inhaler then start it up again.' Her son, an avid Manchester United fan, was described as 'football crazy', naming his bearded dragon Sir Alex after Sir Alex Ferguson. The inquest heard the year seven pupil was 'cheeky and funny' and 'full of life'. On October 19 last year Connor had scored the winning goal in a youth football match. When he arrived home after spending the day with friends, his mother suggested the family order an Indian takeaway. Assurances: The 12-year-old's mother Sarah Donaldson told an inquest she specifically gained assurances from staff at the Tyldesley Tandoori restaurant in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, that the prawn balti ordered for herself and Connor would not contain any nuts, due to their allergies . Due to their nut allergies, Mrs Donaldson and her son, ordered a prawn balti after specifically gaining assurances from staff on the phone that the dish did not contain any nuts. 'The gentleman I spoke to on the phone spoke perfect English,' she told the inquest. 'We discussed that my meal couldn’t contain nuts. He assured me my meal wouldn’t contain nuts. Connor and I do not eat korma or tikka because it has nuts. 'Connor didn’t have a lot to eat - possibly only a couple of mouthfuls because it tasted funny. Within seconds I felt as though I couldn’t breathe. I took a few breaths from my inhaler and went to the front door for some fresh air. 'I came back and sat down next to Connor and he tapped me on the leg and said ""I can’t breathe"". 'I got his inhaler and he took ten breaths from it. The inhaler had no effect and I could tell it wasn’t going well so I straight away rang 999. 'I was comforting Connor and he slumped down and I was on the phone to the ambulance who were telling me what to do. I had already started doing CPR.' When paramedics arrived at the family's Tyldesley home, his condition was so serious there was no time to put him on a stretcher. A paramedic carried the 12-year-old to the ambulance, and continued to try and revive him for 20 minutes en route to the Royal Bolton Hospital. Shortly after arriving at the hospital doctors pronounced Connor dead. Tests confirmed he had suffered from a severe peanut allergy. He had only avoided the food on the advice of his mother, rather than seeking a professional opinion and testing. Minhaz Ahmed, the owner of the Tyldesley Takeaway, said he was satisfied serving a balti to someone with an allergy at the time - but has since realised the potentially devastating effects of cross-contamination. Football fan: The 12-year-old Manchester United fan scored the winning goal in his youth match on the day he died. Connor's family described him as 'cheeky and funny' and 'full of life' Emergency: Connor's mother Mrs Donaldson started CPR while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. Paramedics took over, attempting to revive the 12-year-old for 20 minutes en route to the Royal Bolton Hospital (pictured) where he was later pronounced dead . He maintained that woks and spoons were always clean. He said: 'I would be ok with someone having a balti with allergies. I had been aware of the risk of cross contamination. 'I know even the slightest thing can do something to another curry so we always make sure spoons and woks are clean. 'Not just for allergies but also for flavour. As far as I am concerned the same utensil should not be used in my premises if it will be used for another sauce. 'We do use Patak’s balti sauce. It says it may contain traces of nuts. On the new menu I have said that all dishes may contain nuts. I will recommend customers not to have a balti but I can’t say whether or whether it doesn’t contain nuts. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Also known as anaphylactic shock, the condition can develop very rapidly. Breathing difficulties, feeling lightheaded or faint, changes to your skin including an itchy rash, and swelling body parts, particularly the face, are all signs a person is suffering a reaction. Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. The NHS Choices website advises that if you suspect you or somebody else is suffering an anaphylatic shock you should dial 999 immediately. Many people suffering nut allergies carry an injection of adrenaline medication with them at all times. The injections, often carried in an EpiPen, should be administered into a person's thigh muscle and held in place for 10 seconds. If the person suffering the allergic reaction falls unconscious medics advise they are put in the recovery position. If their breathing stops, CPR should be performed, the NHS Choices website states. Anaphylaxis is the result of a person's body's immune system overreacting to a harmless substance. The substances, for example nuts, are known as allergens. The condition usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen. The most common triggers are insect stings, nuts, other types of food including milk and seafood, and certain medications. Those who suspect they maybe allergic to something should seek medical advice and tests to determine the allergen. 'There is a risk. No matter how careful you are there is a risk. There has to be. Business owners need to know because we don’t want this to happen again.' Coroner Jennifer Leeming reiterated his warning, telling the inquest that all allergy sufferers must be aware of the dangers of eating at any takeaway restaurant, especially Indians, where it is wise to assume there are traces of nuts in all dishes. Varsha Patel, an environmental health officer from Wigan Council, said an inspection of the premises found staff at the takeaway had a poor knowledge of 'cross contamination' of foods and were using the same spoons to decant different sauces. The chef was unaware Patak’s sauces had an advisory label for allergy sufferers. Miss Patel said: 'We didn’t notice any actual peanuts being used. The Patak’s paste was the only product being used which may contain traces of nuts. 'Apart from that there was almond powder and coconut flakes. The powder was being decanted into a drum which can lead to further contamination. 'Almond powder can contain peanuts because they are cheaper. 'We did some research into almond powder and there has been an adulteration with high percentages of peanut powder being used to bulk it up because it is cheaper. 'The almond powder contained at least 50 per cent peanut powder. We need to go back to the wholesaler to investigate further.' Dr Chris Moulton of Royal Bolton Hospital said: 'There are more things in Indian food than nuts capable of causing allergies. I think in this very sad incident the allergy was too overwhelming and too sudden.' The medical cause of Connor’s death was given as an acute asthma attack due to an anaphylactic reaction to food containing peanuts. Dr Vibha Sharma, an allergy expert at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital added: 'If you are eating out in these restaurants or getting takeaways then the people providing the food need to understand you have an allergy but it is still a big risk. If due care is not taken then one would expect serious contamination.' Reaching a conclusion of accidental death, Bolton coroner Mrs Leeming said the public need to be aware of the risk that in food outlets where nuts are used there is a high likelihood of cross contamination. She added: 'Even that small amount caused by cross contamination can be dangerous to a person with a nut allergy. 'I don’t think the message is sufficiently out there that not only do you need to avoid food with nuts in them but you need to be careful about eating food from premises where nuts are used with any food stuff. Even a small amount from cross contamination can be fatal. 'What we didn’t know until the evidence of today is the risk presented by cross contamination in premises where food is sold unsealed. That would include restaurants and takeaways and cafes. 'A very small amount of allergen might be all that is required for a tragedy such as this. Depending on the individual cross contamination might be enough to result in this sort of desperate, desperate tragedy. 'I offer my sincere condolences. I am so glad he got to have that football game and scored the winning goal.' Currently, around 10 people per year die from food-related anaphylactic shock and allergic reactions in the UK.","Connor Donaldson died on October 19 last year after eating a prawn balti .

"For more than a century they have been hidden away in a Royal wardrobe, a reminder of the rift in the House of Windsor caused by the First World War. Now the Queen is facing calls to display the German uniforms worn by her grandfather, George V, to mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of war. The close familial links between the British and German monarchs in 1914 – George V and Kaiser Wilhelm II were both grandchildren of Queen Victoria – meant that George held the honorary ranks as a German Field Marshal and as a colonel of German regiments. The Queen is facing calls to display the German uniforms worn by her grandfather, George V, to mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of war. The British king is pictured (right) in German military uniform, with his cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II (left) He was fitted out for Teutonic uniforms to mark his roles as Admiral of the Imperial German Navy, Prussian Field Marshal, Colonel-in-Chief of the 1st Guard Dragoon Regiment and Colonel-in-Chief of the Kürassier Regiment Graf Getzler (Rhine) No 8. At the time, both sides of the family used the name Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The uniforms are still held by the Royal Collection, but have been displayed only on rare occasions. Last night, former Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay, a First World War expert, said the uniforms should be placed on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum. George V and Kaiser Wilhelm II were both grandchildren of Queen Victoria (above) ‘These are hugely significant items,’ Mr Mackinlay said. ‘Not only do they tell the extraordinary story of the schism between the Royals occasioned by the war, but they are also works of considerable skill and artistry in terms of the fabric and design. 'They have been kept in pristine condition. Displaying them would highlight that despite the fact that these close first cousins were the heads of the two principal belligerent countries, the tragedy of the First World War could not be averted. ‘Many young people today do not realise how close the two wings of the family were – or that Queen Victoria died in the Kaiser’s arms in 1901.’ The conflict led to George changing the name of the family by Royal proclamation in July 1917 to Windsor. A spokeswoman for the Royal Collection said: ‘A number of Royal Collection items relating to the First World War are on short and long-term loan to cultural institutions across the UK, and any loan requests will continue to be fulfilled wherever possible to mark this four-year centenary period.’","Close familial links between the British and German monarchs in 1914 .

"A council's plans to spend £700,000 of its budget giving every pupil a smartphone has been heavily criticised for wasting money today. The phones, costing around £150 each, will reportedly be available for every schoolchild in Aberdeen who does not already have one, so that they all have wifi access at school. The scheme will cost an estimated £30,000 per secondary school and £10,000 per primary school. Resistance is futile: Aberdeen City Council have decide to fund its pupils' smartphones rather than ban them . At the moment, the 24,000 pupils in the city's schools are banned from using their mobiles in class but the initiative is expected before the start of the next school year. Jennifer Stewart, the council's Lib-Dem education spokesman, argued that the money would be better spent on essential resources for schools. She said: '£700,000 is a huge amount of money considering we've got basic bread and butter issues that need to be resolved. 'Other schools have poor toilet facilities, another is excellent in terms of performance but the buildings aren't great and things are falling apart and walls need painting. 'There's always a place for technology, but I think it would make sense to address these other issues first.' 'Digital divide': The head of education in Aberdeen wants to buy all pupils smartphones so that none of them is left out from internet use . Big spending: Aberdeen City Council is using a big chunk of its education budget on internet access at school, but assured it would be supervised . Aberdeen schools head David Leng defended the scheme, saying: 'We don't want to get into a situation where we are trying to ban things that you just can't ban anyway, and not harnessing the powerful possibilities of the smartphones.' He added: 'There have been some concerns in the past that when we do these things we are creating a digital divide between those who have and those who don't. We will ensure that everyone has access to devices and they will always be supervised. 'Nobody will be accessing the internet in a classroom without supervision and when they do it in the playground, they will be going through the school's WiFi, which is filtered. 'Part of the conversations we are having is about mitigating the risk so we will make sure that the safety procedures are in place.' Barney Crockett, leader of Aberdeen City .

"Andrej Kramaric has been told he must hit the ground running for Leicester in their bid to beat the drop as the Premier League’s bottom side ready themselves for an unrelenting run of fixtures. Leicester goalkeeper Ben Hamer knows his team need goals instantly with games against Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City within the space of a month — and spelt that out to his new team-mate. Kramaric played 30 minutes in the defeat against Stoke which undermined Leicester’s recent revival, following the Croatian striker’s £9.3million move from Rijeka after a successful work-permit appeal. Andrej Kramaric signed for Leicester this week, and made his first appearance against Stoke on Saturday . Kramaric (centre) shakes hands with manager Nigel Pearson as he readies himself to come on for the Foxes . Fans are excited by the prospect of the new £9.3 million man - one supporter holds a shirt outside the ground . The 23-year-old has scored 28 goals in 31 games this season but had not played for a month before Saturday. ‘It is hard. He’s just come over and he gets thrown into the action,’ said Hamer. ‘Really, he’s got to make an instant impact. Hopefully he can. He hasn’t got time to settle down because we haven’t got that opportunity. Time is of the essence. ‘He’s been sharp in training. I’ve been impressed with him.’ Hamer, 27, has stepped up to replace Kasper Schmeichel, who is out for a few more weeks after breaking a metatarsal. Leicester keeper Ben Hamer (right) has been impressed with Kramaric in training in his first week at the club . Bojan, labelled by Mark Hughes as one of his best ever signings, won the game with a single goal for Stoke . Pearson said there is no guarantee Kasper Schmeichel will come straight back into the Leicester team . Leicester have scored just three goals in their last seven home league games . Manager Nigel Pearson said there was no guarantee the Danish goalkeeper would come straight back into his team once fit, nor that Mark Schwarzer, signed from Chelsea aged 42, would get a game either. ‘I will make the decision on who plays based on who I think is best at any given time,’ said Pearson. ‘Nobody has a divine right to play and I have been pretty pleased with Ben since he has been in the side.’ Bojan scored a superb goal to win the game, his fourth in 10 appearances to cement his status as one of the best value signings last summer. His modest cost of £500,000 is put into context by the price needed to bring Kramaric to England, or the £25m to take Wilfried Bony to Manchester City.","Andrej Kramaric signed for Leicester for £9.3million from Rijeka this week .

"Aston Villa are confident they have moved ahead of Crystal Palace in the pursuit of Manchester City winger Scott Sinclair. The Premier League champions have made Sinclair available this month and Villa are understood to be edging closer to a permanent move worth around £2.5million. Paul Lambert has been eager to secure a genuine winger to add creative spark to his team, who have scored only 12 goals all season. Sinclair starred for Swansea and earned an £8m move to the Etihad in 2012, but has failed to make any impact. He spent last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion but played just 301 minutes in all. This season he has made just three substitute appearances and has missed out on the matchday squad most weeks. But Lambert feels he could get Sinclair back to his best with regular football and reinvigorate his team. Scott Sinclair played just 10 times on loan at West Bromwich Albion last season . Sinclair has been made available by City, and it is Aston Villa who lead the race for the winger . Paul Lambert (above) is keen to bring the winger to Villa Park and hold off Crystal Palace .","Aston Villa, QPR and Crystal Palace all interested in Man City winger .
Out-of-favour Sinclair would prefer a loan move to Aston Villa ."
