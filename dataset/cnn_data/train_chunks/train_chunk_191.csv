"(CNN) -- Apple on Wednesday said it would cut the price of its 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display while simultaneously updating it with faster processors. The 15-inch model is also getting improved specs, although its price remains the same. The 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro now starts at $1,499 for 128GB of solid-state flash storage, and $1,699 for 256GB of storage. The higher-end model also includes a more robust 2.6GHz Intel Core i5 processor. The 15-inch model still starts at $2,199, but now that gets you a quad-core 2.4GHz Core i7 processor. If you want the best of the best, you can now get a 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro with a quad-core 2.7GHz Core i7 processor with 16GB of RAM for $2,799. SEE ALSO: Retina MacBook Pro: The Laptop From the Future [REVIEW] . In addition to the adjustments to the Retina MacBook Pro line, Apple also took the price of its 13-inch MacBook Air down a notch: The 13-inch model with 256GB of flash storage now costs $1,399. The new prices and specs are effective today, both online and in Apple Stores. The price cuts and speed bumps of the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro make a lot of sense in the light of reviews, which praised the laptop's high-resolution 2,560 x 1,600 display, but lamented that it didn't have the same kind of power to drive those pixels as its larger 15-inch sibling. ""What's inescapable is that this first version of the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro isn't a winner when it comes to price and performance,"" wrote Mashable senior tech analyst Christina Warren in her review. ""It's just a bit too expensive."" Will the price cuts and improved specs make you more inclined to buy a MacBook in the next few weeks? Let us know in the comments.

"(CNN) -- When the world first met Mickey Mouse, it was as a steamboat captain, a cowboy, a wizard's apprentice and in other roles that, while enduring, wouldn't exactly be considered tech-savvy to a 2013 audience. But before the famous mouse came along, Walt Disney created a character who possessed many of the traits of today's gadget geek -- and who maintains his technological edge over Mickey to this day. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit will be familiar by now to players of ""Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two,"" released in November, and the original title in the series from Disney Interactive Studios. And his role in the innovative video game franchise might just be spurring a renaissance 80 years in the making for the long-forgotten character. In the original game, Oswald appeared as a spurned toon jealous of Mickey's immense popularity. He ultimately comes to see the famous mouse as a younger brother. (Oswald was created by Disney in 1927. Mickey appeared the following year.) But in their followup outing, they appear as equal partners. Becky Cline, director of the Walt Disney Archives, said despite being the older one, Oswald was much more into technology than his younger brother, Mickey. Early cartoons featuring Oswald portrayed him as a creative, mechanically inclined rabbit. ""One of his early cartoons was called 'The Mechanical Cow,' where he builds a robot cow,"" Cline said. ""The character himself is very innovative and clever. He winds up his own ears and makes himself into a helicopter, or he takes off an ear and uses it to row a canoe."" In ""Epic Mickey 2,"" the technology gap between the two characters remains. Oswald wields a radio device that allows him shoot electricity, create electrified fields and control robotic enemies. Mickey uses a magical paintbrush, allowing him to create using paint or destroy using thinner. In the game's story, the two combine their divergent powers to save Oswald's homeland from destruction (again). Light Years blog: Mickey Mouse spotted on Mercury? Creative director Warren Spector said Oswald's evolution in the franchise has been designed to reintroduce him to fans after being absent since 1951. His techie edge combines with physical and behavioral differences to set him apart from Mickey, Spector says. ""In the second game, they start out as allies, as companions, as collaborators,"" Spector said. ""They're still brothers, though, so there is still tension between them. Brothers always have tension, but that doesn't mean they don't work together to accomplish common goals."" Spector said the differences between the more modern Oswald and the old-school Mickey is evident in their behaviors. He describes Mickey as ""Boy Scout-like,"" ""a good guy,"" ""always doing the right thing."" ""Oswald is more modern in a sense, because he's a little bit less well-behaved, a little bit quicker to anger, a little bit, dare I say, edgier,"" he said. ""I think it was appropriate that he was the one who adopted the technology."" In the game, Mickey's paintbrush is better at dealing with other cartoon characters, while Oswald's high-tech gear more effectively takes on robots and other mechanical obstacles. ""He's a vintage character, but he has such a modern sensibility to him,"" Cline says. ""He's kinda cool. Kids, teenagers, young people and adults, they're all finding him appealing, and he's a really funny character. He's really kinda hip, actually."" Spector said outside of the game, Oswald has caught on with fans quicker than he would have imagined. ""I hope it is just a start for something bigger for Oswald,"" he said. ""He is a great character and deserves a life of his own in games and not just as Mickey's sidekick."" And none of it would have been possible if the animated techie hadn't once been swapped for a football announcer. Walt Disney lost the rights to his rabbit to Universal shortly after creating him in 1927. However, when NBC wanted to bring sports announcer Al Michaels to their Sunday night football games in 2006, Disney had an opportunity to bring home the wayward character. While there were many other parts to the deal, it is the Oswald-for-Michaels trade that people remember . ""Oswald is definitely worth more than a fourth-round draft choice,"" Michaels said. ""I'm going to be a trivia answer someday."" Oswald also, for the first time, gets a voice in ""Epic Mickey 2."" Famed voice actor Frank Welker, who did the voice of Fred in the Scooby-Doo cartoons and was a voice double for Leonard Nimoy in ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"" was chosen to be the voice of the Lucky Rabbit. ""I think he's probably the greatest living voice artist in the world,"" Spector said. ""When it came to Oswald, (begins to mimic Oswald's voice) I hear Oswald in my head all the time, and he sounds sort of like this (normal voice) and they said what do you think about Frank Welker, and I just said yes."" For all his modern tendencies and techno toys, Spector wants people to just look at how ""cartoony -- that's really the only word I can think of"" Oswald is, a throwback to the old days of cartooning and cartoon characters. ""People have a tendency to think of Disney cartoons as being more realistic or more grounded and less anarchic and crazy and cartoony than some other studios,"" he said. ""Oswald puts the lie to that. In every way that matters, Walt got there first.""","In ""Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two,"" Oswald the Lucky Rabbit steps forward .

"(CNN) -- Despite all the clatter about what's inside the new PlayStation 4 console, games were in the forefront of everyone's mind during Wednesday's Sony launch event. What titles can I play? What will they look like? And when can I play them? Only a handful of games were actually showcased during the event in New York. But Sony said nearly 150 developers are committed to making games for the PS4, so the lineup will continue to grow throughout the year. Wednesday's event brought some startling revelations, such as Blizzard bringing its ""Diablo 3"" from PCs to consoles and SquareEnix teasing a new ""Final Fantasy"" game announcement at E3 this year . All of these games are being made for the PS4, and some are also being made for the PlayStation 3 because of lack of backwards compatibility for the new console. It will be interesting to see how much consumers will transition from the old box to the new one if these new games are still being produced for the PS3 as well. Here are five upcoming games (in no particular order) that looked especially promising. Release schedules are still vague. 'Knack' Presented by lead system architect Mark Cerny as his own vision of games for the PS4, ""Knack"" showed off the graphical capabilities of the new console and its ability to manipulate many objects on the screen at once. The game follows the exploits of Knack, a robot-like being with a talent for summoning surrounding objects to change its shape and acquire new abilities. The animation looks like something from Pixar or Dreamworks, but the gameplay appears more in line with a ""Jak and Daxter"" title. It looks cute and family friendly. 'Killzone: Shadow Fall' Developed to appear to the hardcore gamer, ""Killzone: Shadow Fall"" is the fourth installment in the violent ""Killzone"" shooter series. This chapter takes players back into interplanetary battle against the Helghast menace. Based on the trailer, the gameplay takes place in a futuristic urban environment with lots of sparkle and shine. Early glimpes of the game show smooth-looking animation, persistent effects and plenty of action. This ""Killzone"" looks on the surface like a standard shooter game, but the stunning graphics on the PS4 may be enough to raise it to a higher level. 'Watch_Dogs' ""Watch_Dogs"" was first previewed at last year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) to rave reviews. But it's console functionality was unclear -- until Wednesday night. Set in an alternate version of Chicago, the action-adventure game lets you assume the role of a rogue vigilante who hacks into computer systems to track down and eliminate criminals. A live demo showed off the many ways a player can interact with his surroundings and other characters. The action, and the protagonist's movements, appear to be organic and free flowing. It looks like an open-world environment, although I wonder how much the story will drive where you go. 'The Witness' This indie puzzle title has drawn great interest from fans. Was it the game's intriguing quietness during a launch event filled with fireworks? Was it the serene, inviting tropical-island environment, filled with bright colors and soothing music? Creator Jonathon Blow, who also made ""Braid,"" said his team worked hard to eliminate repetitive action in a game that will take 25 hours to complete. Given the critical success of the similar ""Journey"" last year, this game should do very well. 'Deep Down' (working title) ""Deep Down"" really showed off what the PS4 engine can do. Its new trailer details a showdown between medieval humans and a fire-breathing dragon in a subterranean lair. The battle scenes were intense, and the sword-toting dungeon crawlers moved realistically as rubble rained down on them. In a twist, the game paused during a particularly tense scene as a player sent a note to a friend asking for help. I've not seen this kind of action and detail on any console game before -- is this the future of gaming? Was there a title you were hoping to see during Sony's event? What impressed or disappointed you about the games presented? Tell us in the comments below.","Sony previewed a handful of games at its PlayStation 4 launch event Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- When you are creating the most anticipated horror video game of 2013, there is a certain trepidation about how you are going to bring the scares to your audience. Visceral Games hopes it's up to the challenge with its latest title, ""Dead Space 3."" In the series' third installment, everyone's favorite head case, Isaac Clarke, is back, and still trying to get the visions of a twisted future out of his head. Aliens are still transforming humans into hideous necromorphs (zombie-like creatures made from different body parts) and it is up to Isaac to save humanity from a fate worse than death. Steve Papoutsis, executive producer of the ""Dead Space"" franchise, said his team recognized that keeping things fresh and scary for fans in the third title would be a challenge. It was easy to frighten players in the first game just by introducing the team's horrifying creations, and the second title offered new scares by changing the pacing of the action. 'Dead Space 2' is scary, limb-slicing fun . 'Dead Space: Extraction' (the first of the series) This time, Papoutsis said, the developers are adding new creatures and answering plot questions that have lingered throughout the franchise. However, they really wanted to dive into the head of Isaac more than in previous titles, and in co-op play, that element takes on a new life. ""When you decide to play with a friend, you get details about John Carver (the co-op character) and his back story and his personal journey,"" Papoutsis said. ""We actually leverage that by delivering psychological horror moments. You'll have the psychological dementia that only occur in co-op and really bring details out."" Papoutsis said those dementia moments are highlighted by action occurring on one player's screen while the other player sees nothing. For example, Player One may see Player Two grabbing his head and asking what's going on. Meanwhile, Player Two is involved in a battle for his life against necromorphs. The question then becomes which character is seeing the world as it really is. ""Curiosity will conquer fear even more than bravery will."" -- James Stephens, ""The Crock of Gold"" The development team at Visceral also moved away from ""timed"" scares, frightening moments that are keyed by a character moving to a specific spot in the game. They focused on an overall package of elements -- music, characters, mental tension and even background environments -- to create the feeling of angst players have come to enjoy from the franchise. ""One of the things we looked at over the course of this game is how does our environment play into scares? That's why we really liked the concept of (icy planet) Tau Volantis,"" Papoutsis said. ""It spoke to us about things like survival, subzero conditions, low visibility. ""All these things reinforce the horror element. How can we surprise and delight and keep the players guessing?"" Papoutsis proudly said he has no fear. However, when pushed, he admitted he does get vertigo from time to time when he's high in the air. He said when designing the horror moments in the game, his team members search for the ""relatability moments,"" things that frighten them and in turn will frighten the player. He said the visual moments in the game that could potentially happen, or that players could envision happening, create the most fear and tension. ""The enemies, for instance. These are twisted, suffering humans. The fact you can see the necromorphs with their limbs twisted, spiky bits are sticking up, jaws are missing -- that resonates at a primal level, because you look at it and go, ""Wow. That would be super painful to have that happen to me.'"" ""You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you."" -- Eric Hoffer . Papoutsis said the game's art and design teams also pushed the boundaries of current gaming systems to make scary moments look and feel even more traumatic. ""There are definitely more things to do,"" Papoutsis said. ""We've added a lot more exploration elements."" He is hoping players will get deep into the missions, find out more about the characters and grow more attached to what happens to Isaac. It gives him personal enjoyment when players talk about getting emotionally invested in the game -- through either the story or the horror. ""It takes such a big effort for the team to create some of these scenarios. When you hear a player talk about the moments in a way that expresses how much fun or tension or excitement they had playing through them, it is extremely satisfying and one of the coolest things about making games,"" he said. While he wouldn't reveal what he would call his ""OMG moment"" in the game, Papoutsis said there are definitely a couple of moments in that will surprise and shock players. ""We're anxious to see how our players react to them,"" he said. As such, Papoutsis is inviting players to reach out on Twitter to him (@leveluptime) as they play. He said he enjoys bouncing ideas off fans and is very interested in their reactions to the latest chapter in the franchise. ""Dead Space 3"" became available Tuesday in North America and releases Thursday in Australia and Friday in Europe. It can be played on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC.

"(CNN) -- May the Feathers be with you. In their relentless quest to exhaust the galaxy of new marketing opportunities, ""Angry Birds"" has partnered with Lucasfilm for a ""Star Wars""-themed version of the blockbuster mobile game. The new game launches Thursday on most major platforms: iOS, Android, Amazon Kindle Fire, Mac, PC, Windows Phone, and Windows 8. To quote from Rovio Entertainment's press release, the game follows ""a plucky group of Rebel birds in their fight against the evil Imperial Pigs."" Players will get to ""use the Force, wield a Lightsaber, and blast away Pigtroopers on an intergalactic journey from the deserts of Tatooine to the depths of the Pig Star."" ""Angry Birds Star Wars"" features more than 80 levels. Successful players will eventually face off against a porcine version of Darth Vader. The game is the fifth major installment of the ""Angry Birds"" franchise, which has racked up more than 1 billion downloads since launching in 2009. What's so addictive about 'Angry Birds'? Perhaps this cross-promotional marriage of entertainment behemoths was inevitable. Rovio's ""Angry Birds"" has spawned board games, books, toys and soda pop, while ""Star Wars"" has lent its name to everything from comic books and Legos to snowboards and umbrellas.

"(CNN) -- After announcing that 343 Industries was taking over the blockbuster ""Halo"" franchise, Microsoft has faced plenty of speculation about what the new developer would do with one of the most popular video games. Early reviews of ""Halo 4,"" due Tuesday, have been positive (with some critics saying it's the best one yet). But in the meantime, a live-action Web series has been drawing the sci-fi franchise's many fans to YouTube. The five-part series, ""Halo: Forward Onto Dawn,"" recounts an alien attack on a planet hosting a United Nations Space Command military school. The ambush decimates the unprepared planet, leaving the survival of a handful of recruits in the balance. It's a way to bring a new slice of the ""Halo"" narrative to life and whet appetites for the latest game. Digital filmmakers and executive producers Lydia Antonini and Josh Feldman came up with the idea for the Web series to tell the story of a group of recruits and their connection to the games' iconic Master Chief character. Feldman said 343 Industries wanted to make a big splash with their game and had been impressed by Web videos that had been produced for other gaming titles. Antonini, who was involved in the ""Mortal Kombat"" digital series, was approached by Microsoft and 343 about transforming an interactive story into a linear one. The team had to finish the project ""on what was a pretty nutty schedule,"" Antonini said. ""We wrote, managed, produced the whole life cycle ... in a little less than a calendar year."" Antonini and Feldman brought in people who could stay true to both the ""Halo"" feel and 343's vision of the franchise. The five parts were shot as a movie over 24 days and will be released on Blu-ray disc, but Feldman said they knew they needed break points to fit the series format. ""We had to think about how it would work episodically because that's how the consumers would be viewing it on YouTube,"" Feldman said. ""We didn't want one delivery to come at the expense of others. That's really tough because there is a huge difference between what is episodic, call it television if you will, and the structure of a feature."" That work required a balance of action and narrative for each part of the Web series, yet the entire story still needed to all flow together. The producers said they were also very cognizant of fans' knowledge of the franchise and did not want to stray outside the narrative boundaries already established. The video story fits in to the overall storylines featured in ""Halo 4"" and is a literal bridge between ""Halo 3"" and the new video game. It also introduces a new character, Thomas Laskey, who will play a role in the upcoming game. ""For the hardcore fans that have played the games, read the books, read the comics, have the consumer products, and are fully intending to dive into 'Halo 4,' this is very much an additive experience,"" Feldman said. Antonini said they also wanted to make sure the casual or new fan could appreciate the Web shows and not get lost in the vast history of the franchise. She said developing a story for the Web needed to have its own hook but not one that was outside the overall plot line they wanted to explore. ""It was one of the toughest things about this show. It's like working in a World War II museum,"" she said. ""There is a whole lot of history that people care about and you've got to be really true to, but then it is also wonderful to be able to create something new within that world."" The ""Halo"" series chronicles an interstellar war between humans and aliens known as the Covenant. The protagonist of the games' fictional universe is Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced human soldier encased in green armor. Antonini and Feldman knew the one thing they had to get right from a fan's perspective was their portrayal of the iconic Master Chief. Antonini said a representative from 343 was with them throughout the shooting process and was able to answer questions and point out details to keep them on the right track. ""What we try to do with our extended fiction is create a kind of 'history' for the universe, from which we can draw ideas, scenarios, characters and events, and connect those to the game in meaningful ways,"" said Frank O'Connor, franchise development director at 343 Industries. ""The beauty of this approach, when we get it right, is that for fans of that extended fiction, both the game and the related stories end up having more resonance and meaning. But for folks who simply play the games, the story of the game feels like it comes from a richer, deeper foundation."" Antonini said they had access to the developer's art department to represent the imposing Master Chief with an accuracy that fans would appreciate. ""This was an area we knew we couldn't veer in any way shape or form, and we'd be crazy to,"" Feldman said. ""We had to make the best, most authentic Master Chief gear that you could make."" Daniel Cudmore, the actor selected for the beloved role, is an imposing presence on the screen. Cudmore also does all the stunts and action scenes in the Web series. One of the bridges between ""Halo 3"" and ""Halo 4"" is a series of flashbacks to Master Chief's artificial-intelligence sidekick, Cortana, and what happens to her after the spaceship, ""Forward Unto Dawn,"" is ripped in half at the end of ""Halo 3."" Feldman said he thinks casual and hardcore fans will appreciate some new insight as they get ready to play ""Halo 4."" Part 1 of the live-action Web series was released in October, and the final episode was revealed just days before Tuesday's official ""Halo 4"" release. More than 8 million people watched the first episode on YouTube. It will be interesting to see how many continue the story in the video game.","A live-action Web series has been drawing ""Halo"" fans to YouTube .

"Washington (CNN) -- A lawyer for John Hinckley Jr. is demanding Secret Service surveillance records from a trip the presidential assailant took last March to see his mother. Barry Levine complained at a court hearing on Thursday that the Secret Service provided an inaccurate report of one of Hinckley's periodic trips to Williamsburg, Virginia. Although details were not described publicly, a source with knowledge of the case said the Secret Service told federal prosecutors that Hinckley was involved in a ""disruption"" during a tour of an unnamed facility and that police were summoned. The source said that Hinckley was never involved in such an incident. Photos: The attack on Ronald Reagan . Federal prosecutor Colleen Kennedy dismissed Levine's complaint about the Secret Service, calling it a ""fabrication."" Another source familiar with the case said the Secret Service never said Hinckley did anything wrong. U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman is considering whether Hinckley, 57, should be allowed longer visits to see his mother and whether the psychiatric hospital overseeing his treatment can release him one day as an outpatient. Hinckley, who did not attend Thursday's hearing, was found not guilty by reason of insanity for the March 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan and three others. All were wounded. Read more: The day that changed presidential security forever . He has lived at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington for decades and currently is allowed to spend 10 days a month at his 86-year-old mother's home. St. Elizabeths has proposed giving Hinckley two visits of 17 days duration followed by six visits of 24 days each. The hospital also asked for authority to decide, following those longer visits, if Hinckley could be released on convalescent leave and live full time in Williamsburg with his mother. Friedman presided over 13 days of arguments and expert witness testimony in late 2011 and early 2012. But St. Elizabeths told Friedman last August, that a key part of its outpatient plan for Hinckley had fallen through when a care facility said it would not provide group therapy sessions in Williamsburg. The hospital reworked its proposal, which Levine said now involves a new case manager. Someone already involved in his care will organize group therapy. Opinion: What changed after the Reagan shooting . Levine also said Hinckley is receiving art and music therapy and spending more time at his volunteer job at another hospital. Hinckley's caregivers hope he will one-day get a part-time job with pay as part of a self-sufficiency strategy that will also involve expanding his ties with the Williamsburg community. During earlier court proceedings, mental health experts said Hinckley had done little to make friends in Williamsburg and expressed concern about him isolating himself. But Levine said Hinckley has sought out additional activities in Williamsburg and described him as thriving. Levine complained the government is dragging out the process and delaying a decision. He compared government prosecutors in the case to Captain Ahab in the novel ""Moby Dick"" and said they are engaged in a ""maniacal pursuit of Mr. Hinckley."" Friedman said he would schedule another hearing as early as next month to go over the new treatment plan.

"(CNN) -- OK, so you probably own a smartphone. If you're a student or someone who travels a lot for work, you almost certainly have a laptop. You may also have a tablet computer, which is great for consulting recipes in the kitchen or watching reruns of ""The Office"" in bed. Now you're expected to buy a miniature tablet, too? Since Apple introduced its iPad Mini on Tuesday, some commenters on CNN, Twitter and elsewhere have expressed skepticism about the need for the new device. The Mini is slightly larger than rival tablets from Amazon and Google and about two-thirds the size of the current iPads. Prices start at $329, or $70 less than a full-size iPad 2 but $130 more than a comparable Kindle Fire HD. Analysts agree Apple will probably sell millions of them. But Apple's stock took a dive when the Mini's price was announced, and a search of the blogosphere found less excitement among consumers than what greeted the original iPad or the last several iPhones. ""Apple sells the same item every year just in different sizes ..."" said CNN commenter named JC Nevarez. Said Marc Georges on Twitter, ""There's a woman next to me watching video on her Zune. It is the size of a small brick. In other news, Apple announced the iPad Mini today."" CNN commenter RDNinja wrote, ""They've got so many different sizes of iPhones and iPads, why don't they just custom-make every device to the dimensions I ask for when I buy it?"" Consumers could get whiplash from the way phones and tablets have grown and shrunk in size in recent years. Fueled by interest in watching video and playing games, smartphone screens have been gradually getting larger -- from about 3.5 inches, measured diagonally, to almost 5 inches. Meanwhile, tablets have been getting smaller. The original iPad and its first wave of rivals measured about 10 inches across, but more recent entries such as Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7 have been 7 inches -- small enough to slip into a coat pocket. The iPad Mini measures 7.9 inches diagonally and is 5.3 inches wide -- pocketable, at least according to this blog. Blogger Dan Nosowitz, tongue planted in cheek, declared the Mini's trade-paperback size will make it a more highbrow option for e-book lovers than the smaller Kindle Fire, which more resembles a mass-market paperback. ""Wide rectangles are classier than narrow rectangles,"" he wrote. ""My conclusion: the iPad Mini will be for literary snobs, and the Kindle Fire will be for dumb-dumbs who read airport garbage books. Kindle Fire owners will read E.L. James, and iPad Mini owners will read E.L. Doctorow. You heard it here first."" As phones and tablets merge, manufacturers must find that sweet spot between a device that's easily portable and one with a screen big enough not to cause eyestrain after an hour or two. ""It will clearly come down to personal preference,"" said Ross Rubin, a principal analyst at Reticle Research. ""The dividing line has historically been what would fit in a pocket. Also, the traditional ergonomics of holding something next to your face, or holding something in one hand."" The Mini weighs less than half as much as a full-size iPad. In describing it on Tuesday, Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said it was about the size and weight of a pad of paper. ""Barnes & Noble and Amazon have known this for a while -- that this size product strikes a great balance of mobility and capability for on-the-go usage, as well as 'single hand use,' which is critical to reading and viewing. This has always been a drawback to the larger iPad. You simply can't hold it for a long period of time,"" said Robert Brunner, an industrial designer whose firm helped develop Barnes & Noble's Nook e-reader. ""As for whether iPad Mini is an addition or a replacement for iPad owners, it's probably both,"" added Brunner, who has also worked at Apple. ""Some crazy people will want both, and some will find its size more compelling for everyday use. Studies have shown that most iPads stay in the home, around the coffee table, but the iPad Mini will be a much more mobile device."" But there's the question of how many gadgets people actually need. Will consumers shell out $329 and up (to $659, depending on storage and connectivity) for a device that's not that much bigger than the smartphone they already own? Many online commenters say they don't see the point. ""I COULD get the iPad Mini, or I could literally just keep using my iPhone and see no difference,"" said Krista Doyle on Twitter. ""The iPad (revolutionary when it was released) deserves every bit of praise and success it has garnered thus far. But today, Apple didn't debut an innovative product,"" wrote Jason Evangelho on Forbes.com. ""Today they debuted a clone."" Then again, people in 2010 expressed doubts about the original iPad, calling it little more than a bigger iPod Touch. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced Tuesday that the company has sold more than 100 million of them.","Some Web commenters say they don't see the point of the new iPad Mini .

"(CNN) -- History, we are told, is immutable. What has happened cannot be changed and, when lessons are not heeded, is doomed to repeat itself. The entertainment industry, however, has been known to tamper with our historical memories, changing them to fit a story or to create an entirely alternate version of history. Developers at Ubisoft decided to leave real history alone but explore its gray, murky areas where creative license can still exist in their upcoming video game, ""Assassin's Creed III."" (It's set for release October 30 in North America.) The latest game in the action-adventure series is set during the tumultuous times of the American Revolution. The young nation that would become the United States is just forming and trying to establish itself as independent from the British monarchy. With redcoats on one side and a wild frontier on the other, colonists want the ability to determine their own fate without the crown taking its pound of flesh (or, for that matter, tea). Stepping into this historical arena for a video game could be problematic since the time period is so well-known and the men and women of the time are revered for their accomplishments. Steven Masters, lead game designer for ""Assassin's Creed III,"" said there was a lot of pressure to make sure they got the history right. ""We're treating these characters with respect,"" he said. ""We have so much information about how these people were thinking, what they were thinking, what they were feeling, how they felt about the Revolution. We were able to portray these characters accurately and give the history the service it deserves."" Masters said the abundance of knowledge about the era actually creates problems for game makers. Instead of rehashing what has already happened in a simulation-type game, ""Assassin's Creed III"" aims for the gray areas of history and focuses on events that may not have a clear-cut explanation. With Wikipedia and online searches, it wouldn't take much effort to pinpoint historical inaccuracies in the game. What developers aimed for were moments in time that are less clear or perhaps have conflicting histories. Masters gives an example of a soldier who died on the battlefield. ""Was he shot? Was he stabbed? Was it friendly fire? That sort of thing allows us to go in and insert our version of the history and tell our story,"" he said. That's not to say major historical events won't be represented in the game. Players will be involved in such iconic events as the Boston Tea Party and the battle at Bunker Hill. Masters credits having a historian on staff during the development process for keeping them on track and not letting them take too many liberties. Historian Maxime Durand worked with UbiSoft for more than three years to include and accurately represent key elements of history. While his expertise was Canadian history, his knowledge of the time period in American history was exactly what they were looking for. Because the main character, Connor Kenway, is of mixed heritage (half American Indian, half British), he also looked into the Native American culture from that time to help develop the character. ""We took a look at all the different tribes that were close to New York and Boston in the period,"" Durand said. ""We decided to choose Mohawk because they were the most interesting that appeared during the Revolution. We worked with members of the tribe because we wanted to be appropriate, be respectful as well as be historic."" Masters said it was important to be accurate with the Mohawk history because it serves as the basis for Connor's motivations. There is an entire sequence of the game spoken in the Mohawk language, and Connor's village is represented as well. ""Considering the general treatment of Native Americans in video gaming, I think we've got one of the strongest and most accurately portrayed characters that has ever been created,"" he said. ""I'm really excited to let people see that and bring that to the front."" Durand worked on making Boston and New York, two of the major locations in the game, as accurate to the period as possible using old maps and building drawings from the era. He thinks players could just wander around in those cities and be amazed at all the detail in the look and feel of the areas. People in those cities also react to in-game events that have recently transpired. ""If you've just played the Boston Massacre sequence, in the next sequence people are already talking about that event and offering a point of view about that,"" Durand said. Besides offering historical knowledge to help build the story, Durand also had to keep in mind the game franchise's back story -- a never-ending battle between the Templars and Assassins. ""We wanted to explain events in our own way,"" he said. ""The outcome was always the way history showed it, but how it got there may be a bit different."" ""We're about reliving history,"" Masters added. ""We're about going to those moments and seeing them happen through the history behind the known history."" To bring such a vast, historically rich time period to life, the team needed to have something with more power to represent the huge battles during the Revolution from the perspective of Connor. The game features a new engine called AnvilNext, which allows for greater resolution and more elements on screen at one time. ""To re-create Bunker Hill, that was going to take a completely different technology,"" Masters said. ""You want to be there and experience it. You want the grandeur of that massive battle happening around you."" AnvilNext also helped them accurately represent naval battles (which are new to the series) in the Chesapeake Bay and dynamic weather conditions, both of which played critical roles in history and could not have been done with their previous game engine. Masters said his team really wanted to do everything possible to immerse the player in the era as fully as possible so they could feel like they were taking a ""historical vacation."" ""It's a chance for people to go and experience the history in a way you can't from just reading a book or listening to a lecture,"" he said. ""The power of interactivity allows us storytelling potential for an interesting and compelling way to hear these stories.""","""Assassin's Creed III"" puts American history on center stage .

"(CNN) -- This holiday season, shopping for the gamer in your life is easier -- and harder. Easier because there are so many great choices, you can't go wrong. Harder because, with the release of the new Wii U console and the launch of the PlayStation Vita handheld console this year, there are so many choices, you won't be able to pick. Check out my handy gift guide to get ideas for each type of gamer on your list: . The PC gamer: The computer gamer is probably looking for one thing: more time to play. But in case you want to give them something else to distract them, ""Guild Wars 2"" is an online role-playing game that lets players dive deep into a fantasy world and have an impact with their actions. Unlike other MMORPGs, there is no monthly subscription fee, making it a great (one-time) purchase. If they missed the craze this year, pick up ""Diablo III."" Or opt for other also-on-consoles games like ""Mass Effect 3"" or ""Max Payne 3."" If it isn't software they need, Logitech introduced a new G600 MMO gaming mouse this year, featuring three profiles, 20 programmable keys and a new sculpted shape to ease fatigue from hours of gaming. The serious gamer: The serious gamer is ready to become one with the console and be challenged with action, adventure and good storytelling. ""Dishonored"" offers a play-it-your-way style split between stealth and combat. Combining that style with a good story, this title will have players diving back in after finishing their first run, just to see how their actions change the story. ""Borderlands 2"" is less about the story and more about the guns. There are tons of weapons to be discovered and used throughout Pandora. But pay attention to the dialogue -- lots of laughs among the bloodshed. If they already have the game, think about getting the downloadable content offerings to let them continue their experiences. ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" is another selection guaranteed to tap into your gamer's aggressive side. The vehicle combat scenarios are particularly intense. If it is mental stimulation they crave, ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown"" is a turn-based game that challenges players to plan, think and enact strategies to save the world. Balancing short-term gains for long-term goals is key to success. The casual gamer: The casual gamer wants to drop into and out of games at their leisure. ""New Super Mario Bros. U"" is the flagship title for the new Wii U console and brings Mario and friends to life in high definition. The platforming action is bolder and brighter than ever as the intrepid plumber runs through worlds to save the Princess (once again). Combining the two great franchises, ""LEGO The Lord of the Rings"" mixes the classic Tolkien tale, dialogue from the Peter Jackson movies and a dash of blocky fun to create an exciting game for all ages. Pay particular attention to the funny bits during some of the more dramatic scenes. Maybe it's racing they crave? ""Little Big Planet Karting"" puts Sackboy on the track to save the kingdom through a series of races across very non-NASCAR-sanctioned tracks. He and his racing machine can be customized so players can exercise their creativity while fulfilling their need for speed. The kid gamer: The kid (or kid-at-heart) gamer is looking for fun, excitement and a touch of something extra. Why not a physical toy that doubles as a gaming piece? ""Skylanders Giants"" extends the franchise this year with new collectable figures that connect with gaming consoles to create a sort of video game magic. The pieces are interchangeable for different gaming platforms. So if you have a PS3 version of the game, you can still take your figures over to your friend's house to plan on an Xbox 360. Plus, the toys can be enjoyed as action figures away from the consoles. Tapping into the magic of Harry Potter, ""Wonderbook"" transforms your PlayStation 3 into an interactive storytelling machine. The first title, ""Book of Spells,"" is based on the Harry Potter universe and written by J.K. Rowling. Players control the action, creating spells, fighting battles and becoming part of the story. Finally, Maxwell is back and has to travel the world to save his sister in the new ""Scribblenauts Unlimited."" The puzzle game challenges kids to come up with creative solutions to problems Maxwell faces in his journeys. Write the word in his magical notebook, and it comes to life on the screen to allow him to progress and find the magic to stop his sister from turning to stone. Still stuck?

"(CNN) -- The robbers, police say, were ""well informed"" and had carefully chosen the time and place of their heist. As police officers were busy keeping an eye on areas popular with New Year revelers, four armed and masked robbers forced their way into an Apple store in central Paris and made off with as much as $1.3 million worth of iPhones, iPads and other devices. The robbers entered through a service entrance into the store, which had closed for the day, using violence to intimidate store employees, said Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutors office. They then ""calmly"" went through boxes full of Apple products in the basement storeroom, seeking out iPhones, iPads and laptops, said Christophe Crepin, spokesman for UNSA Police, a national police trade union. Read more: Is Apple starting to lose its bite? ""They knew exactly what they were taking,"" he said, noting that the robbery focused on the merchandise in the storeroom and left the devices on display inside the store untouched. They loaded the stolen goods, estimated to have a retail value of around one million euros ($1.3 million), into a Mercedes van parked nearby and sped off, he said. Thibault-Lecuivre declined to confirm the value of the robbers' haul, saying that Apple managers were still working out how much had been taken. Housed in an elegant Haussmann-style building in a popular shopping district, the store Apple Store at Opera is one of two in central Paris. The other is in an underground mall connected to the Louvre. Read more: Tech trends for 2013: Five things to watch .","The theft takes place as police are busy supervising New Year revelers .

"(CNN) -- Any pedometer will count how much you've walked, but a good, connected mobile app can push, encourage and sometimes even shame you into putting down the milkshake, getting out of the beanbag chair and meeting a fitness goal. Sensors that record data about your fitness, daily routines, vital signs, weight or sleep habits have been around for years, but at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the spotlight is on devices that wirelessly sync data to the cloud and smartphone apps and how they use that information to effectively promote and maintain good health. Digital health tech is a booming area at CES this year with 210 booths in the section reserved for health technology companies. It's a mixed bag of activity trackers, health insurance companies, smart scales, disease management tools and sports gadgets. Wearable sensors have become smaller, cheaper and more powerful in the past few years. More recently, low-energy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth synching capabilities have made syncing to smartphones, cracking open a world of product possibilities. On the show floor, sensors popped up in watches, wrist bands, belt clips, underwear and bra clips, in-ear headphones, fitness equipment and adhesive patches you wear on your skin. Many device makers said it was only a matter of time before they show up in everyday clothes, maybe even in your body. Here are some ways health tech is helping people now: . Encouraging physical fitness . The biggest booths are for the fitness trackers. Pedometers, devices that count steps and distance, have been around for hundreds of years; they were first introduced to the U.S. by Thomas Jefferson. But recent technology has inspired a digital resurgence for the lowly pedometer, with tricked-out new devices that also track calories, how many stairs you climb and sleeping patterns. Fitness tracker company Fitbit unveiled its latest product, the Fitbit Flex, at CES. The $100 wristband comes in a variety of colors, is waterproof and has no display other than a tiny row of dots that light up. It automatically uploads data to your iPhone, Samsung Galaxy Note II or Samsung Galaxy S III every 15 minutes. Once synched, the data is displayed on the app or website as colorful graphs, your progress charted and goals outlined. The smartphone app acts as the hub for your Fitbit, as well as the company's Aria smart scale. If food is something you need help monitoring, you can keep detailed logs of your meals to calculate how many calories you've consumed. ""It's not about the numbers, but how you can be motivated,"" said Fitbit's Woody Scal. Fitbit has integrated effective coaching and training tricks to keep users on track. For example, it can send encouraging or taunting text messages or e-mails and award badges, depending on what motivates you. It also acts as a little social network, letting you connect with and compete against friends. The teeny Fitbug Orb fitness tracker also records steps and sleep, but this round device is designed to fit into an assortment of holders, including a watch band or underwear clip. It also has an app and online coaching services but will only cost $50 when it comes out this summer. French company Withings debuted its newest smart scale at CES, the Smart Body Analyzer, which measures weight, body fat and your heart rate. A healthy home environment is important for health, so the scale tracks air quality, measuring Co2 levels and room temperature. The data is sent wirelessly to an iOS or Android device. The scale will be available in early 2013 and cost $150. Keeping kids healthy . Can video games be used to keep kids healthy? UnitedHealthcare, the largest health care provider in the U.S., thinks it's possible. According to the CDC, 17% of children and adolescents from 2 to 19 in the U.S. are obese. Investing in kids' health now and lowering that percentage could save all health insurance companies money down the line. UnitedHealthcare just launched a test program in three schools using a popular video game to encourage exercise. It partnered with the makers of ""Dance Dance Revolution"" on a gym-class friendly version of the popular dancing game. Up to 48 kids recreate the dances displayed on a large screen, while sensors in the wireless dance platforms record data about how well they are doing. The information is tracked over time and shared with the school, parents and the kid so everyone can see their progress. The idea is to make working out fun and gym class something to look forward to. ""We want to get it into areas where there are limited options for physical activity,"" explained Robert Plourde, the vice president of innovation and research and development at UnitedHealthcare. The company is also working on an interesting beta project that turns an Xbox Kinect into a physical therapy coach. It counts reps and monitors the body's movements to ensure the exercises are being done properly. The GeoPalz ibitz PowerKey activity tracker and paired mobile app are just for kids. The $50 pedometer, counts steps as ""keys,"" which are points that can be collected to win prizes on Amazon, unlock game levels and earn badges. Parents can check in on their kids' progress on their own smartphones. A headset that detects the brain's electrical activity is being used to improve children's mental health. NeuroSky's $149 Focus Pocus game, released last year, helps people with ADHD hone concentration and impulse control skills. Players don the a headset and place an attached sensor on their forehead, which can tell when they are concentrating or distracted. As they play the wizard-themed game, they are rewarded for focusing and completing tasks. Trials of the game saw improvement in concentration after a period of training. More recently, Puzzlebox used the same technology to power a toy helicopter. Less therapeutic and more just cool, the Orbit flies up when you concentrate and can drop back down when you break concentration. The product, which started as a Kickstarter campaign, costs $189 and will begin shipping soon. Monitoring the chronically ill and seniors . Some of the most promising developments in the health tech area are for people with chronic issues such as heart failure, Parkinson's, hypertension or diabetes. With the right sensors and apps, they can take a reading at home and transmit data to the cloud, where their doctors can monitor progress and look for red flags that they might miss during a short office visit. Ideal Life's connected systems include small devices that measure blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rates and oxygen saturation, and it has a scale specifically for congestive heart failure patients. At CES, the company announced it was teaming up with ADT on an integrated alert system. These remote health management services are appealing to hospitals, doctors and health programs because they can cut down on costly medical care by catching issues early and helping people avoid trips to the emergency room. But all that data being collected is valuable in other ways. Providers can amass the anonymous data for all patients to look for trends, assess programs and fine-tune treatment programs. Having an outsider be notified of changes in health is also helpful for senior citizens living on their own. Instead of the classic emergency buttons worn around the neck, sensors can alert care givers to anything out of the ordinary. They don't even need to be health sensors. Connected home systems such as Lowe's Iris can be programed to send a text message when a senior doesn't do a regular activity such as opening the fridge or turning on a light. A final smartphone-connected gadget for seniors (or anyone who takes a lot of pills) is the clever uBox. This round, functionally designed box reminds people when it's time to take their pills with a combination of beeps, blinking lights and smartphone reminders. If they've already taken the pill for that time period, the box remains locked so anyone who is forgetful or suffering from dementia won't take a double dose. The uBox will notify family members or health care providers if a dose is skipped. The company, founded by MIT engineers, is raising money on Indiegogo.","At the Consumer Electronics Show, there are 210 companies in the digital health area .

"(CNN) -- It is hard enough to make one good video game. Trying to make two at the same time is a challenge not many developers try to tackle. But the creators of a recently released, turn-based strategy game hope that by blending two differing styles of play in one title they will find a pot of gold at the end of the double rainbow. ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown"" is a science fiction, strategy game pitting Earth against an invading alien force. An elite group of soldiers, scientists and engineers from all over the globe is tasked with repelling the aliens and restoring peace to our planet. While most games take two to three years before hitting the shelf, lead designer Jake Solomon said his split-personality labor of love has taken more than four years to come to fruition. ""I've been trying to make this game for as long as I've been in the industry,"" he said. ""The original 'XCOM' game is my favorite game."" The resource management game mainly takes place in the XCOM headquarters. It is where you find out about each new mission, but also where you tell scientists to start exploring new technology or have engineers build a containment area so you can interrogate alien captives. You'll also have to manage finances, deal with demands from different countries and develop your military force. Building out the ""ant farm,"" as Solomon calls it, takes some planning by the player, but can result in bonuses if done well. ""Some things are tied into the narrative and you only get one base,"" he said. ""But we wanted players to have an emotional connection to their base. In the (on-base) bar, soldiers who are killed during combat will have their names on a plaque to show you what your victories cost in human lives."" The field squad portion of the game is more about combat tactics, maximizing your weaponry and out-thinking (and out-shooting) the enemy. Squads consist of four to six soldiers, each with their own names, backgrounds and expertise. Use them wisely (i.e., keep them alive) to complete the missions and they get stronger. The action is still turn-based, so planning and strategy are important at this level as well. Set up your soldiers, hope the aliens walk into your kill zone and cut them down. Guess wrong and players can only watch helplessly as their soldiers get outflanked and end up on the board in the bar. Solomon said developing the combat portion of the game was fun from the very beginning, but that, for the longest time, the resource part wasn't. It created a lot of tension and sleepless nights for Solomon and his crew, but they hit on a revelation that helped them find the sweet spot for ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown."" ""The way it has to work -- they have to feed off each other in a symbiotic relationship. They give each other meaning,"" he said. ""You research lasers and now my favorite soldier has a laser rifle. When I shoot, I see a laser coming out. (The connection between the modes) feels more real because there are all these concrete things behind it."" There was initially a lingering fear with how the game was being developed, he said. Developers ran the risk of alienating players who might like one part of the game, but not the other. ""(Firaxis creative director and 'Civilization' creator) Sid Meier ""has a quote -- 'One good game is better than two great games,' "" Solomon said, jokingly referring to Meier as ""my lord and master."" ""The danger of having two games in one game is that people are going to enjoy one of them more than the other."" But he said his team tried developing a resource strategy-only game and a combat-only game, and both felt like they were missing something. The soldiers really had no personal connection to the player in the resource portion and the mission rewards didn't mean as much in the combat game. ""There are some games that have these multiple modes to them, but nothing like this. In 'Starcraft,' you go back to the ship or in 'Diablo,' you go back to the town. Those aren't really games; they are just breaks. In 'XCOM,' you have a game, then you go on to another game."" Trying to find the middle ground took a lot of trial and error. The pendulum kept swinging from overly complicated to overly simplified, Solomon said. In the end, decisions were made based on how well they worked with both aspects of the game. ""It just came down to stripping out a lot of things that weren't working and getting a flow in there,"" Solomon said. ""You come back to the base and say these things have meaning for me. On the soldier side, deepening the class system and customization became important."" ""It was pretty organic. It was a process that I didn't have a road map for."" Solomon was very careful not to tread on the memories of fans of the original ""XCOM."" ""They have a very large ownership in the game, so it is important to honor the name,"" he said. ""I can't tell you how many nights I've lost sleep worrying about whether I've made the game fun."" Now, players can decide. The game was released Tuesday in North America and comes out Friday in Australia and Europe. The game will be released on both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles as well as for PCs.","""XCOM: Enemy Unknown"" combines resource management and combat strategy .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft is joining forces with two television shows to make TV a two-way experience for kids. Using the motion sensor and voice-recognition software in Microsoft's Kinect system for Xbox, children will be able to interact with two popular shows for young viewers: ""Nat Geo WILD"" and ""Sesame Street."" The idea behind these two new game/TV applications -- ""Kinect Sesame Street"" and 'Kinect Nat Geo TV' -- is to have characters in the programs talk to the kids and help them participate in show activities. For example, in ""Kinect Sesame Street,"" Grover will ask viewers how many coconuts are in his box. Under normal TV viewing, a child could give any answer and Grover would say, ""That's right. There are 5 coconuts in the box."" With the two-way experience, if the child gives a wrong answer, Grover would ask him or her to count again and would only continue once the right answer is given. Terry Fitzpatrick, executive vice president of content and distribution at Sesame Workshop, envisions the Kinect as a new way to connect with the ""Sesame Street"" audience as the program enters its 43rd season on television. ""(The Kinect) is a natural and intuitive interface for preschoolers,"" he said. ""You don't have to teach a child how to use a mouse or how to use one of those complicated controllers that most gaming platforms have."" Fitzpatrick said his company has worked hard to layer interactivity into their shows for ""Kinect Sesame Street TV."" The shows are from last season, but the experience for the kids will be totally new. If the child doesn't feel like playing along, the show will continue passively, just as if it was broadcast on TV. Microsoft also is discovering people are using Kinect for more than just gaming. Usage numbers for Xbox LIVE in the past year show a growing percentage of time spent on nongaming activities, the company said. Microsoft feels this partnership with Sesame Workshop and National Geographic was a perfect extension to appeal to those nongamers. ""People who have been our gamers for a long time are also expanding their entertainment usage of the platform,"" said Jaymi Bauer, Xbox director of product marketing for family experiences. ""What you see with 'Kinect Sesame Street TV' and 'Kinect Nat Geo TV' is that first real concerted effort of how we use interactive entertainment with gaming mechanics."" Bauer said until now many young kids may not realize the TV doesn't hear them and might jump when told to jump. She hopes when Elmo throws a ball to a child and the child catches the virtual ""ball"" and throws it back, it will open up brand new experiences for those kids. Both Fitzpatrick and Bauer said this partnership is likely to open doors to new content opportunities for kids and gamers. Fitzpatrick said Sesame Workshop learned a lot about what kids will do in front of a television when prompted, which will help them develop new interactive content for the future. And Bauer credited Sesame Workshop with finding a unique way of getting kids to stand in the best spot for the Kinect to be effective. ""When you develop things for a 3-year old, you've got to be drop-dead simple and really smooth to use,"" Bauer said. ""They've actually developed this really clever application of a mirror. The mirror is a little character himself, and he's wanting you to find yourself. The little ones are shouting, 'Here I am!' and they are standing perfectly in the sweet spot for the Kinect."" Each episode runs about 45 minutes, depending on the interactivity level of the child. A hard disc of eight episodes can be bought through retailers ($29.99), but shows can also be downloaded using Xbox LIVE ($4.99 per episode or $29.99 for a season pass). There is also bonus historical content for both shows included on the disc and with the season pass. Do you want your TV to talk and play with your child?

"(CNN) -- ""Borderlands 2"" weaves together a rich, deep storyline with its ""shoot everything"" mentality to produce an adventure that will immerse you for many, many hours. The game opens back on Pandora, a planet with a Wild West mentality and penchant for outlaw justice. It begins five years after the ending of ""Borderlands"" and the opening of the Vault, a location of rumored riches that actually contained a huge alien beast with massive jaws and multiple tentacles. This time, Pandora is under the control of a man named Handsome Jack, who is mining the planet for a valuable resource in order to open yet another Vault. It's not hard to figure out Jack is the villain -- you begin the game left for dead after being attacked by his henchmen. One of the main things ""Borderlands"" may have lacked, ""Borderlands 2"" has in spades -- a great narrative with interesting characters. The writing team at Gearbox Software really delved deep into each character, making them unique and giving them purpose. Players can connect with them and that sense of immersion raises the level of ""Borderlands 2"" from just a simple shooter to something more. Dialog from the characters helps cement that attachment, as well as providing some comedic moments. Some of the death screams of enemies are almost ""Monty Python-esque"" and the humor helps take the edge off all the dying and suffering that goes on around you. Banter between characters is laugh-out-loud funny. Serious soldiers have lighthearted moments and comedic foils are portrayed in serious moments. The range is what you'd expect from real people, not typical one-dimensional game characters. Even Handsome Jack, bad guy though he may be, evolves and changes throughout the game. Starting out as a sarcastic, taunting, self-centered jerk, he changes and starts to exhibit other, more caring emotions. But as with most people, you find out what he's really all about in the end. You really are going to hate this guy. The story progresses through a mission/quest based system. There is the main quest (beat Jack, save the day), but there are numerous side missions that help raise your experience while helping you understand what's going on with Pandora. Interaction with other characters is a must. Take your time through the missions. See everything there is to see. Talk to anyone you can. It makes the game more enjoyable and you'll discover even more missions. Finishing the game will take hours, so there's no rush to get to the story's climax. ""Borderlands 2,"" like its predecessor, is all about the loot -- specifically weapons. There are hundreds of different weapon configurations to be found or bought. Do you keep a pistol because it does acid damage or opt for the shotgun with more power? The choices can be exhausting, but can really be tailored to fit your style of play. There are boxes containing loot at nearly every turn. Unless you are in open terrain, it's hard not to find one of these boxes around. Players will get overwhelmed by the amount of treasure they find and will, at times, have to leave some behind because they can't carry it all. You'll sell off a lot, but end up spending that money on more ammo or better shields. And nearly every enemy you kill will drop something. Makes you wonder where that spider-ant is hiding that sniper rifle, but hey, he obviously doesn't need it anymore. Oh, and outhouses scattered throughout Pandora are real treasure chests. I guess people didn't notice they were dropping their weapons as they were taking care of business. The customization extends from the armory into the player characters themselves. There are four characters to choose from. More of an assassin? Zero is your guy. Axton is a commando soldier while Salvador is a ""gunzerker"" (think crazy guy with two guns). Maya is a Siren, with telepathic/mystical powers. Each playthrough will be unique depending on which skills you choose. Characters can also be visually customized. Change your character's head or clothes and you can still stand out in a crowd of Zeros. Graphically, the game looks and plays like ""Borderlands."" Controls are basically the same with only a few changes. Environments are noticeably different, though, looking sharper and more vibrant than before. There are also barrels full of acid, electricity, explosives and the like on battlefields, so make use of them to take care of large groups of enemies. For a game as large and deep as ""Borderlands 2,"" there were only a few visual glitches. (Helicopter pilots would remain in mid-air after their choppers were blown to bits. Creatures would get blown into solid rock faces from grenades, not allowing them to be killed but still allowing them to fire at you.) Want to up the challenge? Add up to three friends and the enemies (and loot) ramp up appropriately. Choose between up to four-player online co-op or (if you want to have your partner next to you) two-player split screen co-op. The game will also support two split-screen co-ops if that's how you want to roll. It really works best when four people play different classes because each complements the other with their particular skills. Having four assassins would be a bit silly.

"(CNN) -- Every year, 1.5 million children around the world die from vaccine-preventable diseases, 10 million girls under 18 are forced into marriages, and 1 million people die from malaria. What does it take to make people in developed countries more aware of these life-and-death issues happening in what can seem like distant parts of the world? How about fun online games and the chance to win fabulous prizes, like backstage passes to meet Lady Gaga? That's the concept behind the Global Good Challenge, a new initiative to grab the Facebook generation's attention. The online contest's goal is to promote the United Nations Foundation's missions and drum up support for international activism and the U.N. itself. The games are a combination of simple one-question quizzes, sharing information like your ZIP code or e-mail address, and social actions such as Tweeting or following the organization on Twitter, Liking something on Facebook, or posting something directly to your timeline. Referring friends is also worth points. For every action you take, you earn ""tickets,"" and for every three tickets you earn you are entered into the sweepstakes once. Why the grab for your information and social media activity? The project's creators believe social capital is just as valuable as money. Like a benevolent Ursula the Sea Witch, the Global Good Challenge is most interested in getting your voice. ""We're trying to reach to a lot of different constituencies"" said . Timothy Wirth, president of the U.N. Foundation. The games are a way of engaging a new, younger audience, and gathering broad citizen support. That can take the form of people calling their congressmen or any number of other informal actions, said Wirth, a former senator from Colorado. The newest prize, announced on Friday morning in San Francisco, is the chance to ride along as a guest during an America's Cup practice run with champion yachtsman James Spithill. ""It's the equivalent of being on the back of a linebacker during a (football) game,"" Spithill said. Even more interesting than the online challenges are the programs themselves, which are worth talking about without the promise of prizes. Shot@life is working to increase vaccinations in developing countries. Girl Up encourage American girls to get involved raising awareness of the issues girls face around the world, and the U.N. programs addressing them. Nothing but Nets raises money for mosquito nets to prevent malaria in Africa. The Global Good Challenge project is the brainchild of the Global Entrepreneurs Council, a group of successful under-40 entrepreneurs assembled to refresh the UN Foundation's image and find new ways to promote its programs by tapping into the social media set. Members include Zaw Thet, Brian Gott, Sergio FernÃÂ¡ndez de Cordova and Randi Zuckerberg. Wirth affectionately refers to the group as ""our young tigers."" Each contest is open for a limited amount of time, and new prizes and challenges will be added in the future. Current prized include the America's Cup ride-along, two VIP tickets and backstage passes to a Lady Gaga show, tickets to see Stevie Wonder at the U.N. Day concert, and a chance to go to the MTV Video Music Awards. To win, you just need to spread the word. ""You will literally be becoming a digital do-gooder, or a 'clicktavist,' and saving someone's life,"" said Elizabeth Gore, the U.N. Foundation's vice president of global partnerships. The U.N. Foundation was founded by Ted Turner in 1998.","The Global Good Challenge it trying to turn activism into a game .

"(CNN) -- In an entertainment environment where sequels often do better than the original, it could be considered risky for a gaming company to do something different. However, one team thinks it's the perfect environment to showcase new ideas and stories, not more of the same. ""Dishonored"" (Arkane Studios, Bethesda Softworks) is a brand new title set in a steampunk-like world that puts players in the role of an assassin set on restoring his name. Co-creator Harvey Smith said he and co-creator Raphael Colantonio didn't set out solely to make something unique, but that the game evolved from a core set of values they knew they wanted the game to have. ""It's a weird blend of a first-person shooter, but has the (role-playing game) depth in story and narrative,"" Smith said. ""People would say, 'Aren't you afraid of (competing with) the sequels?' But other people would say, 'Thank goodness it isn't a sequel.'"" Smith said the team just started spitballing ideas about games they would like to play without worrying about sales or marketing. In what he calls an organic process, Smith and Colantonio took their experiences from previous games they worked on and decided to focus on an environment based around historical London in the 1800s during the Victorian era. With the help of their visual design and art team, the look of the game changed into something of a ""retro-futuristic"" design, and with it, a change in what they wanted to do with the gameplay itself. It was during this phase Smith and Colantonio began fleshing out the details and narrative of ""Dishonored."" The idea of having two distinct ways to play, and succeed, in the game became the focus. But with that came problems, because it's a unique approach. Smith said many of the early problems with designing the game came because they were developing a new and different world. ""There's a different religion. There's a different calendar. There are different animals. There are different continental maps,"" he said. ""I get why people want to work with a particular (established) brand because it solves a lot of problems going forward. ""(But) from a creative standpoint, it is super refreshing to work on something new and let it take you where your passions take you -- to not be beholden to some past thing you've done."" The process of creating something new is time consuming since there is no background material to help get a jump on designs. Even when early artwork started getting a steampunk look to it, Smith wanted to stay true to being original -- ""No clichÃÂ©d steampunk."" Instead, he prodded the artists to think about a version of the alternate-history style that might exist on a completely different world. One idea led to another, Smith said. But even with the game's aesthetic fixed, there was still gameplay style to create from scratch. They settled on two possible approaches: combat or stealth. ""There were moments when we would look at the combat and it wouldn't be working just right,"" he said. ""I can't tell you how many versions of the stealth model we went through. But the range is very deliberate; it is one of our core values to let players play improvisationally."" Smith said giving players the opportunity to write their own story and create their own experience with such a wide range of possibilities was important. Pete Hines, vice president of PR and marketing at Bethesda Softworks, said ""Dishonored"" is a blank slate where players get to define the game instead of having a narrative forced upon them. ""You play the game you want to play,"" Hines said. ""It is really up to you based on your choices. What would it be like to be a supernatural badass assassin?"" Hines said with new environments and game mechanics, players get challenged. Because the world isn't as familiar as it may be in a game that has had sequel after sequel, they can play again and experience something fresh and new each time. He compares the game, in a way, to the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books. ""Our tag line is 'Revenge Solves Everything',"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean killing solves everything. They've put in place consequences to the choices you can make."" Smith said how players go about completing the main narrative -- reclaiming your name and honor after being falsely accused of killing the empress -- will have an impact on what happens in the end. He said the emergent narrative, where things spontaneously occur due to what players do in the game, becomes something unique that gamers will take away from their experience. With games like ""Fallout,"" ""BioShock,"" and ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"" Smith thinks gamers are evolving. They want games with depth, he said, without sacrificing sheer entertainment value. ""Players have gotten fluent and thirsty for more interactivity,"" Smith said. ""'Dishonored' is an interesting game. It is a game that doesn't play itself. Twenty years ago, that may have been a challenge. I think increasingly you are going to see more players want that sort of thing."" ""Dishonored"" will be released Tuesday, October 9, in North America, October 11 in Australia and Japan, and October 12 in Europe. It is available on PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.","Bucking sequel trend, ""Dishonored"" takes a new approach .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly 16 years after a fuel tank explosion destroyed TWA Flight 800, killing all 230 aboard, the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday proposed to fine Boeing Co. $13.57 million for failing to meet a deadline intended to prevent similar catastrophes. The FAA said Boeing failed to meet a 2010 deadline to give airlines information on how to reduce fuel tank flammability, missing the deadline by 301 days for its B-747 aircraft, and by 406 days for its B-757 planes. Because of the missed deadline, airlines have asked the FAA for extensions to make necessary fixes, the FAA said. The FAA said it is considering extending a deadline requiring airlines to retrofit half of their aircraft by 2014, but will not extend a 2017 deadline to retrofit all impacted aircraft. Some 383 Boeing aircraft in the United States are affected by the delays, it said. ""We take this matter very seriously,"" said acting FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. ""We have issued hundreds of directives to eliminate fuel ignition sources over the past 16 years, and this step will add another layer of safety."" In a two-page letter to Boeing on Friday, the FAA proposed the fine of $13,574,400. Miles Kotay, a Boeing spokesman, said Friday in a statement that the company is ""committed"" to continuing efforts to provide a solution to the problem. ""Boeing has since provided the service instructions to the FAA concerning the out-of-production aircraft that are the subject of the proposed penalty,"" the statement said. ""In compliance with the rule changes, Boeing has already included a Flammability Reduction System in the basic design on the 747-8 and 787. The system is being installed on all Boeing airplanes currently in production (737, 747-8, 767, 777 and 787) and is available for retrofit on all other out-of-production models. The system is currently in service on 1,805 Boeing airplanes around the world."" The July 17, 1996, explosion of TWA 800, a Boeing 747, was one of the deadliest accidents in aviation history, and was among the most difficult to solve. Although it was originally feared the explosion over the Atlantic Ocean near Long Island, New York, may have been downed by terrorists, National Transportation Safety Board investigators eventually concluded that a short in some electrical lines ignited the volatile fuel-air mixture in the plane's nearly empty center-wing fuel tank. The TWA 800 case illustrates the slow process of identifying and correcting dangerous systems on sophisticated aircraft. By the time all jetliners are retrofitted with safety systems in 2017, two decades will have passed since the initial accident. The FAA has itself come under fire for the slow pace of change. In 2005, the NTSB criticized the FAA, saying there had been little progress in making aircraft safer from fuel tank explosions. ""The stark reality is that on a fleet-wide basis, on the flammability side we are no different today than we were in 1996,"" the NTSB said at the time. On Friday, the FAA took the offensive, saying Boeing had failed to meet deadlines. The FAA said that since the TWA accident, it has issued 283 directives to prevent the ignition of vapors in and around commercial aircraft fuel tanks. In January 2010, Boeing committed to providing instructions for FAA approval for airline mechanics by December of that year. The instructions were to explain how to install systems that would replace the oxygen in airplane fuel tanks with non-flammable nitrogen gas, reducing the risk of explosion. But it missed those deadlines, the FAA said. The FAA said Airbus, the other aircraft manufacturer, met the deadline. Boeing has 30 days to respond to the agency.","The FAA says Boeing has failed to meet a deadline to prevent similar crashes as TWA Flight 800 .

"(CNN) -- Nintendo released details about its upcoming Wii U console during a news conference Thursday. But, as happens in the age of social media, reactions began pouring in just as fast as the facts were coming out. The Japanese game company made announcements in Japan, the United States and Europe, each one talking about the three main points everyone has been wanting to know: when will Wii U be available, how much will it cost, and what games can I play on it? Prices and release dates vary around the world, but U.S. gamers will get first crack November 18. A basic version of the console package will sell for $299, while a ""deluxe"" version -- including additional memory, a stand and charger for the GamePad, and the ""NintendoLand"" game -- will go for $349. Reaction in the gaming community ranged dramatically from joy to pessimism. As prices for the two versions of the console were announced, a split seemed to form over whether the Wii U was too expensive for what it appears to be offering. TheVoices, a commenter on the CNN.com story, said, ""Just can't see myself spending money on another product like this. I'll wait for the 720 (Xbox whatever it is called) or the PS (Playstation) 4."" G4 Network host and reality-TV vet Blair Herter joked on Twitter, ""Not a fan of the Wii U's price but I'm getting it for my kid because even though the child hasn't been born yet I WILL BUY HIS/HER AFFECTION."" However, others were just as quick to point out the history of new console release prices. Twitter user Brandon Whaley reminded people what the PlayStation 3 cost when it came out in 2006. ""I still don't get the fuss over the Wii U price,"" he tweeted. ""The PS3 was FIVE HUNDRED NINETY-NINE DOLLARS at launch."" A Twitter user in the UK offered an international perspective on the price battle. Larry Bundy Jr. tweeted, ""Dear US friends, Please stop complaining that the Deluxe Wii U is $350. In the UK, it will be ÃÂ£330 ($533) and ship WITHOUT a sensor bar!!!"" If it wasn't the dollars (or yen or euros) being discussed, the topic centered on the games being offered. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime said that more than 50 games would be available from the launch to the end of March but didn't say specifically which titles would be available at launch. Some games drew more attention than others. ""Bayonetta 2"" was announced as a Wii U exclusive, drawing howls of protest and disbelief from many on social media who enjoyed the original on other consoles. Others were excited about the news. Ally Tamara from Canada wrote on Twitter, ""Well I guess I'm gunna have to buy a WiiU now since Bayonetta 2 is only going to be on that platform. I apologize to my Xbox and PS3."" The variety of announced titles tried to hit as many different genres and fan bases as possible. Many people found at least one game that attracted them to the new Wii U console. Perry, commenting on the CNNMoney.com story, wrote, ""Sold. I was almost positive that I was getting a Wii U before, but with Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate coming... Please, take my money."" Video game writer Matthew Furtado said on Twitter, ""Nintendo Land sold me on the Wii U. Tons of fun with those games today. Never mind the brilliance of NSMBU (""New Super Mario Bros. U"") and lots of others."" David MacArthur added, ""Looking at ZombiU changed my opinion of WiiU. Excited. Hope Nintendo release more than a handful of games aimed at adults this time."" Despite reports of brisk pre-orders, other people urged caution and patience before rushing out to get the new console. Some are worried Nintendo is just playing catch-up to Sony and Microsoft, and wonder what happens when their new consoles arrive. ""I don't hate the #Wiiu, but there's nothing yet that demands a day 1 buy,"" wrote Richard Wiltshire on Twitter. ""can we not be nintendo fanboys just this once please internet?"" James Andrews is concerned about next-generation consoles. ""What's so special about the wiiU? it's just a wii with Playstation 3 graphics and a tablet. Come on Nintendo be more creative!"" ""I'm still not impressed. If it's only 'on par with current consoles'... the ones that are at the end of their cycle... that's scary,"" wrote Samantha (Twitter handle: @reluctant_gamer). Still, commenters generally agreed that the Wii U will sell well in the beginning, pointing out how successful the Wii console sold on launch. The trick is to sustain that initial momentum, many say, will be releasing a stable of good games people will want to play. Two game reviewers said they were hopeful for the outlook for the new console. Max Parker, video game columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said, ""I'm optimistic because of more info on good exclusives. Plus it seems genuinely different from the rest of the crowd. I'm up for a change of pace."" And a Twitter post by Ben Kuchera, senior editor for the Penny Arcade Report, may sum up the overall feelings of many about the Wii U -- at least for now. ""Nintendo Wii U: More expensive than I'd like, software focus on casual, but a ton of potential. Overall? Can't wait."" What do you think about Nintendo's announcement? Let us know in the comments below.","Reactions range from excitement to skepticism on Nintendo's Wii U .

"(CNN) -- Nintendo announced a November release date for its next-generation Wii U on Thursday while looking to shore up two key constituencies -- those still puzzling over the console's ""second screen"" controller and hardcore gamers who still view the Wii as geared toward families and kids. The Wii U will launch in the United States on November 18. Two configurations will be available: a basic set for $299 and a $349 ""deluxe"" edition that will have additional memory, a stand and charger for the GamePad and the ""NintendoLand"" game. At a New York press conference, the company also introduced Nintendo TVii, a free TV and movie service that utilizes the Wii U's handheld controller, with its built-in screen, as a remote control and tablet-of-sorts for additional content. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime acknowledged that, while players who have gotten their hands on the new console have enjoyed it, others remain confused. ""We've come here today not just to make news, but to give you a better sense for how Wii U will change the way you play games, how it will connect your gaming friends and how it will change the way you watch television,"" he said. ""The agent of that change is the Wii U GamePad -- a second screen that does not exist anywhere else."" The U's major advance on the company's top-selling Wii console is the GamePad, which has a 6.2-inch touchscreen that interacts in various ways with games that are designed for it. Players can play together, with one person using a TV screen and the other using the game pad, or a single player can get additional content on the GamePad that enhances the game on the big screen. E3: With new titles, Nintendo works to explain Wii U . While it's not certain how many new titles will be available at launch time, at least 50 games will be available for the Wii U by March, Fils-Aime said. And while Thursday's events showcased new titles in venerable Nintendo franchises like ""Mario Bros.,"" there was heavy focus on games favored by more hardcore and adult players. Those titles included ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 2,"" ""Mass Effect III,"" ""Assassin's Creed III"" and ""007 Legends."" ""The Wonderful 101"" and ""Bayonetta 2,"" both from Platinum Games, will be exclusive to the Wii U. The company has trumpeted enhanced video and memory capabilities on the new system as a way to provide an experience that's at least on par with the rival Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sony Playstation consoles, which are preferred by many diehard gamers. Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg, who attended the event, called the Wii U ""the most capable Nintendo platform ever, especially for the kind of games we make."" He touted planned titles like ""Skylanders Giants,"" ""Wipeout 3"" and ""Transformers Prime,"" as well as the ""007"" and ""Call of Duty"" games. ""We've never been able to achieve this level of realism before on a Nintendo platform,"" he said. Nintendo TVii brings together a way to stream, watch and record shows and movies from sites like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and YouTube. Via the GamePad, it lets users get additional information about shows and share thoughts via sites like Facebook and Twitter. Richard George, an executive editor at gaming site IGN who covers Nintendo, said Thursday's presentation may have been the moment the company finally hammered home the value of the new system. ""Nintendo's presentation and vision is far more comprehensive and compelling than what they showed at the past two E3s,"" he said, referring to a summer video game conference. He said the price may be slightly more than many had predicted but that the free inclusion of Nintendo TVii, which he called a key selling point, offsets that. The presentation made strides with the hardcore gaming crowd, but that key holes remain, he said, notably titles like ""Bioshock: Infinite,"" ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Grand Theft Auto V."" Questions still remain about which, if any, of those titles will be coming after the launch period. But while reaching out to new audiences may be a focus, Nintendo has sold 630 million gaming consoles since 1983 and George says that's a big deal. ""Loyal Nintendo fans will snatch this up like crazy,"" he said.","Nintendo announces launch date, price for Wii U console .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans wrested control of the House from President Barack Obama and the Democrats this week, and their next goal is to take the White House, their leader in the Senate said Thursday. If the Republicans want to achieve their goals of repealing health care reform, ending bailouts, cutting spending and reducing the size of government, ""the only way to do all these things it is to put someone in the White House who won't veto any of these things,"" Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation. McConnell made clear that his party sees little room for compromise with Obama and the Democrats, saying voters were calling for a change in direction, rather than a middle ground. ""We can hope the president will start listening to the electorate after Tuesday's election. But we can't plan on it,"" said McConnell, who was recently quoted as saying his goal is to ensure that Obama will be a one-term president. ""I don't want the president to fail. I want him to change."" In an interview with CNN later Thursday, McConnell reiterated that it is Obama who has to shift direction, saying: ""If the president will simply listen to the American people, we can do some business."" The Republicans failed to capture control of the Senate this week, leaving McConnell the minority leader, but they're riding high on a gain of at least six seats there and 10 times that many in the House. ""For the past two years, Democrat lawmakers chose to ignore the American people, so on Tuesday the American people chose new lawmakers,"" McConnell said. ""The White House has a choice: They can change course or they can double down on a vision of government that the American people have roundly rejected,"" he said. In response, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters Thursday that voters wanted politicians in Washington to work together to solve the nation's problems, not continue taking intractable positions to score political points. ""You're certainly not going to make progress in a divided government saying 'my way or the highway,'"" Gibbs said, noting that Obama has called McConnell and other congressional leaders to a November 18 meeting to discuss legislative priorities. Consensus on issues ""is not going to be 100 percent of what anybody wants,"" Gibbs added. In his speech, McConnell conceded that the elections were not about the Republicans. ""They were about the Democrats. They got a report card. They got an F,"" he said. ""Americans voted for change in the last two elections because of two long and difficult wars and because they hoped a changing of the guard would stabilize the economy and get America moving again,"" McConnell added. But, he said, ""Democrat leaders used the crisis of the moment to advance an agenda Americans didn't ask for and couldn't afford."" In particular, McConnell lambasted the health care reform bill passed by Democrats after a bitter legislative fight that lasted more than a year. ""Health care legislation is the worst bill that was passed in my time in the Senate,"" said McConnell, who was elected in 1984. He called the Wall Street reform bill intended to bring transparency and consumer protections to the financial services industry almost as bad. McConnell has promised a non-stop effort to repeal the health care bill, in an apparent strategy to force Democrats to record votes in favor of the measure that can be cited in the 2012 election campaign. With Democrats still controlling the Senate, the chances of a repeal making it through Congress are considered highly unlikely. Even if that happened, Obama's veto power adds another formidable barrier against a repeal measure succeeding. Gibbs said he doubted that Obama would have to veto a repeal effort, saying: ""I honestly don't think it will come to that."" He noted that exit polling showed half the voters Tuesday supported the health care bill, and that most people who cited the measure as an important issue supported the Democratic Party. CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: McConnell tells CNN that election results show President Obama must change .

"(CNN) -- It's looking like Apple's next version of its iconic smartphone will be called the iPhone 5. On Tuesday, the secretive company sent e-mails to members of the media, inviting them to an ""invitation-only event"" in San Francisco on Wednesday, September 12. The event is widely expected to be the launch of the next iPhone, but in typically cryptic Apple fashion, the invitation reveals little about what will be announced. The tagline says only, ""It's almost here."" Of course, that never stops Apple obsessives from parsing the invite for clues. This time, the shadow of the number 12 reveals a not-so-subtle ""5,"" reinforcing speculation that the new device will be called iPhone 5 instead of iPhone 4G or something else. The official announcement of the September 12 date confirms what several media outlets first reported five weeks ago, citing anonymous sources at Apple. A fall iPhone release has been considered a foregone conclusion by most observers for months. Among the device's rumored new features are a slightly larger screen, a faster processor, a smaller dock connector and possibly NFC technology that would make it easier for shoppers to make payments through their phones. iMore, the first blog to pinpoint the September 12 launch date, has also said pre-orders will begin that day and that the phone will be released nine days later, on September 21. Many pundits also expect Apple to launch a smaller version of its popular iPad tablet at a separate event, likely in October. Next week's Apple event will begin at 10 a.m. PT. CNN Tech will be liveblogging the announcement.","Apple is inviting the media to an event in San Francisco on Wednesday, September 12 .

"(CNN) -- Composer Hans Zimmer comes from a long line of atheists. So he wasn't looking to beat anyone over the head with ""The Bible"" -- his latest score, for the breakaway hit on the History Channel. Zimmer is known for, among other things, his signature ""BRAAAM"" -- an ominous bass drone cue associated with the ""Inception"" trailer -- well known in the movie business for punctuating almost every major action movie in the last few years. ""It's over every trailer!"" Zimmer laughed when talking to CNN. ""It's funny how that sort of thing becomes part of the zeitgeist. But I suppose that's exactly what trailers are looking for: something iconic, lasts less than a second, and shakes the seats in the theater. We've seemed to unleash some sort of genie."" On this new project however, Zimmer said he wanted to stay away from anything so obvious. Zimmer and his composing partner Lorne Balfe also wanted to stay away from anything that might feel rooted in a specific time period, eschewing the classical music references that had informed many of his previous scores. ""If you listen to Verdi, if you listen to Berlioz, if you listen to Mozart, if you listen to anybody else -- Bach for that matter -- who has dealt with religious music, there's always a reflection of the style of their time,"" Zimmer said. ""And in a funny way, 'The Bible' is supposed to be a reflection of how we in our time relate to this material. We felt like if we could figure out a sound that was sort of timeless, and sort of absent of whatever is fashionable at the moment, that would be a good start."" Because the scope of the ""The Bible"" was so huge, with stories that span thousands of years, ""10 hours is not that long to tell a monumental story like this."" So while it wasn't long enough on the one hand to tell the stories (which, despite not being religious himself, he deemed ""powerful"" with a ""great meaning of morality""), it was still longer than most of his projects. To get a handle on it, he decided thinking smaller was the way to go. ""Rather than look at the daunting enormity of it, you find some inspiration in some little corner of the movie, just so you get a foothold,"" he said. For additional inspiration, Zimmer turned once again to Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard, who added her haunting vocals to the Golden Globe-winning ""Gladiator"" score. Zimmer mentioned Gerrard to producers Mark Burnett and Roman Downey who were very supportive of the idea. At first, Zimmer said, Gerrard said she was really busy, ""but as soon as I said, 'Would you like to work on 'The Bible' with Mark and Roma?' it was as if none of the other stuff mattered. She was instantly on board. This was something she's always wanted to do."" With the shoot taking place in Morocco, and production offices based in Los Angeles, the in-between point for the group became London. ""Lorne, Lisa, Mark, Roma, and myself, whenever anyone found a moment, we could meet up in London and throw out ideas,"" Zimmer said. ""It was like a band."" The process was loose and unstructured -- ""very different from how I work on a movie normally,"" Zimmer said. A lot of improvisation was involved, as the composers moved through different textures to find ""some sort of specificity."" ""What the music is trying to do is maintain the idea that throughout these 10 hours, you get to feel something,"" he said. ""We're not telling you what to feel. We're just inviting you in. The music is trying to open doors."" And open doors, it did. ""To Mark and Roma's credit, they didn't care if this was going to be a success or not,"" Zimmer said. ""When we started, there was no money and no belief in the project, other than our own. Their enthusiasm carried the day. They just wanted to do this, and they were just going to do it, which is the right reason to do a project."" ""The ones where you say, 'I need to do this. I can't sleep if I don't do this. I can't do anything else,' those are the ones with the most chance of being successful. I love working with people who don't care about the money, who don't care about the danger of failing, who just go for it. That's what made me do it. Fearless people are the best to hang around with.""","Hans Zimmer composed the music for ""The Bible""

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, small groups of people worked feverishly on the next great revolution in digital media. It was going to be wireless. Only most people didn't know that at the time. Some of us thought it was coming but could not be sure. It was a time of great excitement and uncertainty. For a time during that hot summer of 2002, I worked long hours in a nondescript office building in the suburbs of Kansas City with a handful of pioneers on a coming app store: PCS Vision on Sprint. I was working on mobile for the Weather Channel, and we were trying to get weather radar maps to appear on phones for the first time. Would people want them? What levels of zoom should we choose? Would the wireless networks be strong enough? Meanwhile, in Japan and other Asian countries, early content services and app stores such as i-mode were paving the way. Across Western Europe, text messaging was skyrocketing, but not in the United States in the same way. Even ""American Idol,"" launched in June 2002, did not allow viewers to choose the winner by text message until the next season. Mobile Web, basically browsing on a phone, had been around for a few years but had not hit its stride. The browsing experience involved small screens with mostly grayscale text displaying basic information such as weather, sports scores and news headlines. PCS Vision launched a number of new apps in August 2002, including our app from the Weather Channel, that media company's first downloadable app for a mobile phone. At the time, we thought it was a big deal, but it clearly was an experiment, and we weren't sure it would work. Unlike most apps today, it wasn't free. Mobile starts to take off . Other U.S. carriers were also launching app stores with news, sports, weather and games. At the same time, some early adopters pulled out a Palm, Pocket PC or Blackberry PDA to check e-mail. And pagers had not totally disappeared from the marketplace. By 2006, the mobile Web was growing stronger thanks to the emergence of better phones such as the Motorola Razr and handsets from Nokia and LG. Fast-forward to 2008, the year after the iPhone's debut. Larger groups of people at media companies, wireless carriers, handset manufacturers and games companies were jumping in. Those of us in the digital media industry were pivoting from ""will mobile be a big deal?"" to ""how big will it be?"" That first app for Sprint PCS provided a healthy revenue stream for the Weather Channel for several years and was accompanied by mobile Web, video and messaging services by 2008. When the Weather Channel was sold to an investor group led by NBC Universal in 2008, mobile was a major area of interest in the acquisition. That same year, Apple and Google were starting to turn the world of mobile handsets upside-down with their groundbreaking new app stores. As apps became mainstream, people routinely listened to music, played games, checked e-mail and tapped news and info on their phones. Co-workers were frequently asking me when the next release of an iPhone or Android app would hit the market. For some of us, mobile had moved from the kids' table to the grownups' table. Mobile products also became central to a company's brand image, and they started to contribute in important ways to financial success. I like to tell people that my first four years working on mobile at the Weather Channel were spent trying to persuade people not to turn out the lights and that my last four years were trying to figure out how big mobile could be. In July 2009, I moved to CNN for the exciting opportunity to build out its mobile business. Redefining business . Today, companies like Facebook, ESPN and CNN rely on mobile for their futures. People often find it more effective to interact with others via text than via voice or e-mail. Products like Foursquare and Twitter have joined the new mobility nobility. Media companies around the world are seeing their businesses redefined. For example, what is a TV today? Is it really just a big stationary box in the corner of a room? What is a magazine? Is it really just a bunch of impactful pictures accompanied by text on glossy paper? And what is a website? Is it really a site designed for people who browse on a PC? When we as consumers look for a site on a phone, we now often expect content that is easy to read and watch on a phone. And who is the big winner? Consumers and organizations worldwide who embrace the change and see it for what it is: a change every bit as big as the advent of the telegraph, radio, television and PC. Who loses, or at minimum misses, an opportunity? It's those who don't realize that phones and tablets are a fundamental change in terms of the ways that people interact with their world. This mobile movement constitutes one of the most profound changes in consumer behavior in our lifetime. We see changes in many facets of our lives, from how we interact with others to where we eat, where we meet, how we experience a visit to the doctor, how we pay bills and what we know about the last play in a football game. Today, CNN is launching ""Our Mobile Society,"" an initiative that will explore this sea change in our lives. We're telling this story across at least four screens: TV, PC, tablet and phone. Please tell us what you think. Go to cnn.com/ourmobilesociety or to the ""Our Mobile Society"" section of the CNN apps for iPhone, iPad, Android Phone and Windows Phone.

CNN is dedicated to embracing the mobile medium and being as bold in it as we have been in TV cable news (launched in 1980) and the PC-based Web (in 1995). About every 15 years, there is a major revolution that enables us to live up to our convictions at CNN. Thinking back to that summer in Kansas City building the weather app, we knew what we were doing could be big. But we didn't know how big. We had no way to know when some of the transformational milestones would occur. Many of the answers now unfold in front of us, in our daily lives. At least two things are certain: it's only going to get bigger, and the change affects nearly everyone.","Ten years ago, I was working on mobile apps for the Weather Channel .

"(CNN) -- Roaches crawling out of air vents. Roaches climbing up seats and windows. Roaches on people's coats and hats. Roaches everywhere. It sounds like a scene from a horror movie -- but is in fact what passengers say happened on a Greyhound bus journey from Atlantic City to New York on Friday. ""There's like a thousand roaches,"" passenger Dawn Alexander told CNN affiliate WABC. ""And when I say infested, I mean infested. People were in the aisles literally brushing roaches off of them."" ""We thought it was one. It turned out to be a whole house full of roaches,"" said a fellow passenger. ""I sat down -- roaches started crawling up on our clothes, falling down from the ceiling. Everything,"" said another. Cellphone footage shows the pests scurrying across the bus floor and steps. Greyhound's Media Relations Director Maureen Richmond said the bus driver had acted swiftly when passengers alerted him to ""bugs on the bus."" Bionic cockroaches to the rescue . ""He immediately pulled the bus over and radioed our dispatch office for assistance,"" she told CNN. ""A second bus was immediately sent to continue the trip into New York. We have spoken with each passenger and provided full refunds."" Greyhound has apologized for the inconvenience to the 48 passengers on board the bus, which departed Atlantic City around 10 a.m. Friday. ""We are investigating how they got there -- in bags or from the bus,"" said Richmond. What caused the insects to start pouring out of the air vents about 15 minutes into the journey is not yet clear -- nor what Greyhound plans to do to get rid of them. Alexander told WABC she was sitting in the back of the bus when she saw those toward the front starting to panic. ""Then after a while, the panic got towards the back because we all started looking around and saw roaches crawling everywhere,"" she said. According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, roaches ""are common even in the cleanest of crowded urban areas and older dwellings"" and are found in all types of neighborhoods. Happily, the pests don't usually hitch a ride on a bus to the Big Apple. In 2011: AirTran sued over cockroaches on flight .

"(CNN) -- Those of us who love travel know it can be a life changer. Since making resolutions is de rigueur this time of year, why not resolve to take steps that lead to adventurous and memorable trips all year long? Consider these eight resolutions for 2013: . Take off on your own -- even if you're traveling with a group. (Especially if you're traveling with a group). While togetherness can be great, at a point we all need a break. If you're an early riser, step out and stroll the half-empty streets before your fellow travelers get up. Longing to check out a boutique or museum no one else will appreciate? Do it on your own. If you feel badly about ditching your companions, pretend it's an adventure. Suggest everyone spend one morning or afternoon finding something they'll later introduce to the group. Not only will you discover some cool new spots when you regroup, you'll get to spend time alone inside your own head on your own personal treasure hunt. Everybody wins. Don't let the lack of a foreign language keep you at home. No matter how many (or how few) stamps you've got in your passport, hit the road anyway. When you arrive at your destination, those you'll meet won't expect fluent French, Mandarin or Swahili to flow from your lips. But you still should at least learn the pleasantries in your hosts' country -- as in ""thank you,"" ""please,"" ""excuse me"" -- before you show up. If you have time and the funds, why not sign up for a brief language course in your hometown? If you're on a budget, your local library likely has phrasebooks or dictionaries you can borrow. Does a restaurant in your area serve food from your destination country? Visit before you go and ask the staff to help you with a few words. Smart travelers know that it's the small things that mean the world to those you'll meet. Show respect by speaking their language -- even if just a little -- and you'll get respect in return. Say you're not a ""tour"" or ""cruise"" person? Give one a shot. Many of us experienced travelers pride ourselves on making our own way in the world, seeking out B&Bs and locally owned boutique hotels. We scour blogs and message boards for barely known ethnic eateries on the other side of the world. And once we arrive, we muddle through broken French-Turkish-Vietnamese-Urdu to figure out how to get around. But for a change, why not sign up for an excursion where someone else gets paid to do the planning? When going to parts of the world where no one is likely to speak your language -- or if you're visiting a place where it's not especially safe to travel alone -- an escorted tour makes plenty of sense. Even if you think a cruise will be too confining, consider taking one based on your passions or interests. It could be American baseball legends, classic Hollywood films or the sounds of ""Soul Train."" Or set sail to a destination like Antarctica or Alaska, where being on the water makes navigation easier. Don't be ashamed to fall back on what's familiar. As someone who often writes about cuisine, I love fine dining, great wine and Michelin-star restaurants as much as the next foodie. Still, there are some days on the road -- even in incredible food destinations like Paris or Rome -- when I get a craving for McDonald's fries and nothing else will do. And that's OK. I still remember years ago when a Spanish corporate colleague hosted me for a day of sightseeing and shopping in Madrid and for a coffee break she took me not to a historical Spanish cafÃÂ©, but to Starbucks. I was appalled. But now as a more seasoned and far less snobby traveler, I appreciate it. I have an American friend who lives in West Africa, and when she recently came to Paris, what did she long for? Stops at Starbucks and the city's first Chipotle location. Sometimes you just want what's familiar and comfortable -- so make no apologies and indulge. Vow not to leave vacation days on the table. Even though Americans earn less vacation time than most other industrialized countries -- a median 12 days, according to a recent Expedia Vacation Deprivation study -- they still tend to forgo two days. Whether folks think they can't financially swing a trip or fear their bosses will think negatively of them for taking off, we're leaving that earned time on the table. I never was one of them, but I always foolishly took my work with me on the road, calling into conference calls and frequently checking e-mail when ""on holiday."" But that's a bad habit -- and one you'll be expected to maintain if you do it. So don't start. Otherwise, you'll return from your vacation in need of another one. Periodically disconnecting from work is not only good for you, but it also will make you a more productive employee or boss when you get back. Start a travel-specific savings account. No matter how much we love to travel, most of us aren't made of money. Very often, our discretionary funds -- or the lack of them -- determine where we go, when, and for how long. But if there's someplace you've been dying to check out, why not create your own personal layaway fund? These days, it's easy to pre-arrange for a set amount of cash -- even if it's just $15 or $20 -- to be deducted from your paycheck or bank account. Or go the low-tech route and toss spare change and small bills into a dedicated jar. Over time, even small sums add up and just may mean the difference between taking that trip and staying home. The adage about your checkbook showing what you care about is true. If travel is truly a priority for you, then save like it. Do at least ONE thing that scares you while you're on the road. Travel often shakes you from your comfort zone -- and that's a good thing, especially for those of us who feel an obsessive need to always be in control. Why not consciously decide that while you're away from home, you'll do something that's a bit out of character? Nothing dangerous, of course -- just eyebrow-raising for you. For some of us, that's sampling a dish we'd never try at home -- whether fish cheeks in China or Tuscan cinghiale (wild boar) at the always-lively Il Latini ristorante in Florence. (So what if you hate it? You never have to try it again.) For others, it's ziplining over the jungles in Costa Rica. Yet others may take the baby step of going to the theater alone. Don't forget to build an element of whimsy into your trips -- and perhaps surprise yourself, too. Don't let other people's fears keep you from going. There's nothing sadder than letting other folks' hang-ups keep you at home. How many of us have been told how ""scary"" certain places are because someone knew someone who'd once heard of someone who'd been robbed on a train or gotten sick from the water? Perhaps you've been advised not to visit a country because there won't be many people who look like you. But so what if people stare? Although people in ""low-look"" countries such as the United States and Great Britain are taught that it's impolite, not all cultures consider steady eye contact ""rude."" In ""high-look"" countries such as Italy, you may find yourself the object of a long gaze. Perhaps people are just curious or think you're attractive. Travel teaches you that we can't always judge others' behavior by how we do it at home. Use common sense, but vow to make travel choices that speak to you and your values, not other people's fears. Besides, friendliness and warmth transcend languages and cultures, so travel expecting the best. Maureen Jenkins is a freelance travel, food and lifestyles writer. A Chicago native, she lives outside Paris and blogs about expatriate life at UrbanTravelGirl.com.","Try breaking away from the group to explore a little on your own .

"(CNN) -- The Newtown, Connecticut, public school district will receive a $1.3 million endowment from the U.S. Department of Education to help the community recover from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced Friday in Hartford. The funding comes as a grant under the Project School Emergency Response to Violence program. The money is meant to support the school district's behavioral and academic recovery efforts, which include ""counseling, wellness activities, and training programs designed to assist families and school staff heal after the trauma,"" according to a press release. ""While we continue efforts to enact President Obama's comprehensive approach to make our schools and communities safer, we want to do whatever we can to support ongoing recovery efforts and ensure this community has the resources it needs to meet the needs of its teachers, students, and families,"" said Duncan. The announcement came during a forum the secretary attended with Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and other state officials to discuss education reform and school security with parents, students, and school officials. Malloy also announced a $5 million grant to local communities to help meet the expenses of additional school security, the first round of funding under the Competitive Grant Program, a part of the Gun Violence Prevention and Children's Safety Act, signed into law in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Two additional rounds of funding, both $5 million, are expected in the next year. A lone gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School last December, killing 20 children and six educators before taking his own life.","The grant will help support counseling and training programs .

"(CNN) -- When working on her nude series, artist Karen Divine sometimes joins other photographers at group photo shoots with a model in a studio. She's usually the only woman, and she's usually the only one without a high-powered digital camera. She always gets funny looks when she joins a group shoot with just her phone. Last week one photographer said to her, ""Oh, gee, that works for you?"" In fact, it works quite well for her. She shoots, composites and manipulates all her pieces on her iPhone. Divine's nude series explores whether a female photographer approaches photographing women differently than the male photographers who dominate the field. The series has not only been recognized as great iPhone work, but it also stacks up well against traditional photography. Her work won two awards in the international Eyephoneography photography competition and won first place in the Fine Art Nude category in the Lucie Awards, an international photography competition. Since she discovered the potential of the iPhone as a photography and art tool a year and a half ago, Divine has downloaded 50 photography apps and stowed away her bulky cameras that had been invaluable tools in her art career for the past four decades. ""I haven't really shot with my camera since,"" she said. Smartphone artwork is increasingly becoming recognized as a viable new media form, providing an opportunity for veterans to expand their style and reach. Mixed media artist David Swann has worked in welding, film and digital photography, printmaking, painting and Photoshop; for him, the iPhone is just another canvas. ""It's not out of disrespect for traditional processes,"" Swann said. ""It's just another way of taking a creative idea and putting it out there for people to share."" His mixed media works might include a photo manipulated on the iPhone, then printed on a canvas and overlaid with acrylic paint. David Rams, a former photographer for Playboy Magazine who is also now experimenting in mixed media, said he pulls photos taken on his Nikon into his phone and applies filters. Sometimes clients like them more than the full resolution photos. He finds beauty in imperfections: in scars on people and in scratches and overexposure effects of some Instagram filters. For him, app experimentation is like sketching. Art photography: When 'reality isn't good enough' ""There's no stress,"" he said. ""I don't have a client breathing over my neck."" It also allows him to document his personal life without feeling like he's in work mode, unlike when he has a camera hanging around his neck. ""There are some moments you don't want to be carrying a camera so you can be involved in it, but a cell phone is a lot more spontaneous,"" Rams said. All three artists said settling for the lower resolution of the photos was worth the improvisation the iPhone allows. They can grab a shot of a neat cloud formation when running errands, or composite a new piece while waiting in a doctor's office. It's not only experienced artists playing on their phones. Smartphones and apps provided a platform and tools for creative types who hadn't pursued art because of lack of training or supply funding. Daria Polichetti and her partner, Nate Park, launched the website iphoneart.com in 2010 for mobile artists to upload their portfolios and share techniques with each other. They hosted the L.A. Mobile Arts Festival in August, which they said was the largest gathering of mobile art to date with more than 200 artists' work showcased. ""There were well-known artists alongside soccer moms,"" Polichetti said. ""People from all over the world, from Lebanon, Turkey, Africa, were able to come together in a way that wasn't possible before in the world of art."" Mobile devices have allowed more people to become part of the art world, and both Polichetti and Divine, whose work was featured in the festival and is posted on the site, are welcoming the newcomers. On Wednesday Polichetti launched an iprint online store where artists sell prints of their work. ""We feed each others' creativity,"" said Divine, who is teaching her techniques at workshops. ""I can teach techniques, but people have to have a vision and work from a place where they can express themselves."" Polichetti said she often hears that mobile artists aren't truly artists because they hit a button to apply a few filters, and it's the app developers who are doing the real work. ""These artists are innovating art at the front of the field and doing things these app creators didn't even know was possible. They're inventing new processes,"" she said. ""It's a real collaboration."" Do you think mobile phone art is a legitimate art form?

"(CNN) -- Two teens who, in separate incidents, threatened to carry out similar attacks as the massacre in Newtown were promptly arrested this week -- a sign that law enforcement officials have taken an aggressive no-tolerance approach against potential copycats. In California, Sergio Cabada posted messages online that he ""both supported the actions of the school shooter in Connecticut and had thought of possibly committing similar acts,"" police in the city of Fairfield said. Police learned of the statements about 9 a.m. Monday. By Monday afternoon, detectives had tracked them down to the 18-year-old in the northern California city of Suisun. Cabada was arrested and faces felony charges of criminal threats, police said. ""Several items were seized from the residence in an effort to both complete the criminal investigation and to prevent any future acts of violence by Cabada,"" a police statement said. In the second case, police in Tennessee arrested Shawn Lenz, 19, after he allegedly posted threatening messages on Facebook. Lenz, in a post Sunday, wrote: ""feel like going on a rampage, kinda like the shooting where that one guy killed some teachers and a bunch of students,"" CNN affiliate WSMV reported. He was arrested the same day and charged with terrorism, harassment through the Internet and possession of drug paraphernalia, the affiliate reported. In school shootings, patterns and warning signs . The arrests come after investigators in the Connecticut elementary school shooting issued stern warnings to potential copycats. Last week, Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance warned that threats would be ""investigated statewide and federally and prosecution will take place when people perpetrating this information are identified."" However, such arrests may prove difficult to prosecute, legal experts say. ""This country is based on freedom of speech,"" said Ryan Calo, a law professor with the University of Washington. ""Saying things about the Connecticut shooting somewhat in a threatening manner, that is not going to be actionable, for the most part."" But, he added, ""If you intentionally interfere with an investigation, mislead officers trying to conduct an investigation on purpose, well then, yes absolutely, you're going to be prosecuted."" There may be another way to prosecute suspects but that also raises issues, said Calo. ""Another is where you intentionally create a public panic,"" he said. ""But understand what the prosecution would have to show is the post or the tweet was done intentionally, was done on purpose, in order to interfere with the investigation in order to create a public panic and that is a relatively high bar to show. "" Strangers inspired to honor Newtown victims . CNN's Tina Burnside and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","The arrests of the teens are for separate acts, one in California, one in Tennessee .

"(CNN) -- There are many ways to lose or ruin your smartphone. Forgetfulness, crime, gravity, anger, intoxication, acts of God. The devices are increasingly tied into our lives, and being without them can be a huge loss. They're also not cheap, especially if you're not eligible for a carrier-subsidized upgrade. But between theft, water damage and our own clumsiness, accidents happen. Here are some stories of smartphone woes. Share your own in the comments. Thieving . Smartphones are easy to spot, steal and resell, making them a popular target for thieves. Mobile apps have been created specifically for tracking down misplaced or stolen mobile devices, and police are learning to handle the cases. The year 2008 was a different time -- there was not yet a Find My iPhone app to aid vigilante justice. That's the year Jessica Jenkins, a 5-foot-1 broke grad student, splurged on and was quickly separated from an iPhone 3G. While riding the 6 train in New York City late one night, Jenkins took out her new phone and started playing a maze game. ""Normally I was careful to keep the phone out of sight while traveling, but it was late and I was bored and, like a little kid with a Gameboy, excited to play all these new games,"" said Jenkins. Suddenly, a teenage boy about twice her size ran past, grabbed the phone out of her hands and dashed through the train door. Jenkins chased the thief full-speed and managed to grab him by the shoulder, but he got away with her phone. When Jenkins called the NYPD, officers were more concerned about her physical well-being than the fate of her smartphone. Angry but unhurt, Jenkins took the subway home where she still had an old Nokia bar phone. She immediately reactivated and dropped $5 on Tetris for the ""dumb"" phone. (""I am really, really good at cell phone Tetris."") Jenkins stuck with feature phones until 2011, after her heart and wallet had time to mend, but she's still incredibly cautious in public. Now she lives in the Bay Area, where she works as an immigration lawyer. She never takes the iPhone out on San Francisco public transit, except for Caltrain, which ferries many workers to and from their jobs in Silicon Valley, because it ""somehow seems safer since it looks like an Apple commercial on there during rush hour."" Drowning . Smartphones and water do not mix. But 70% of our planet's surface is covered with the stuff, so statistically they're bound to meet. Photo producer Amber saw not one but two of her iPhones die watery deaths, one glamorous and one in a toilet. While working on a photo shoot in Bordeaux, France, she was (playfully) pushed into a pool with a smartphone still in her pocket. The phone was her primary way of communicating with everyone working on the shoot. She took it to the Apple store in Paris, but they couldn't revive the phone. She ended up borrowing an older iPhone 3G to use the rest of the trip. Cut to two years later, when Amber's adventurous 1-year-old daughter decided to toss mom's iPhone 4 in the toilet. She somehow firmly lodged it into the drain, where it became stuck. ""I'm trying to pull it out before the phone is 100% damaged, trying every tool known to man as fast as possible. The 1-year-old is jumping all excited at the show, screaming because she wants to play with me in the toilet,"" recalls Amber. It didn't work. The phone stayed stuck until her husband came home eight hours later. Photos of the wee phone-destroyer's first birthday party were all lost. Amber wasn't eligible for a new phone yet, so she had to pay full price for a new device. She also sprung for Apple Care and a $90 waterproof case. Though it didn't work with Amber's phones, sometimes a device can be revived after getting wet. One common remedy is to make sure the phone is off and submerge it in uncooked rice overnight, which will draw out the moisture. Breaking . We've all seem them, the people with cracked screens who still use their smartphones. Usually the cracks just create a little web over the screen, and the phones are still perfectly usable. But not all the time. CNN iReporter Terry Balmer, a 20-year-old college student, was hanging out on his roof with friends when he placed his phone down in what he thought was a secure spot. He did not consider the dangers of receiving a text while the phone was on vibrate. Yes, a few minutes later he watched his phone slide down the rooftop and plummet to the ground. ""Hearing the phone hit the cement below was one of the most gut-wrenching sounds I had ever heard, and I don't think anyone has ever climbed down from a rooftop as fast as I did that night,"" Balmer told iReport. The damage wasn't fatal. The phone still worked, but the glass was cracked and all but one section of the screen had gone black. Even black, the touch screen still worked. Amazingly, Balmer found a way to make the phone usable. To read a text message, he would take a screenshot, go into the Photo Roll, and move the image around to read what it said. Unable to see the keyboard, he typed from memory. To make a call, he had to have a person's number memorized. And to listen to music, he learned to navigate through his collection by memory. He even uses it as a camera, explaining, ""I just have to kinda guess what I'm taking it of but it usually works out and they all turn out normal on my laptop."" It's been seven months, and Balmer is still using his iPhone. At first he didn't replace it because he was broke, but now he's grown attached to it. ""Over time this phone has become almost a part of me (as weird as that sounds). I just can't believe that it has survived this long so I feel bad just pulling the plug on it."" Repairing . Balmer's experience is not unusual. Oftentimes smartphones are, in the words of Miracle Max, ""only mostly dead."" You can learn to cope with your hobbled device, you can drop money on having it fixed by a professional or you can attempt to fix it yourself. While attempting to grapple with a screaming child and a car seat, Brian Buizer dropped his month-old Evo 4g smartphone, and its screen shattered. (If there is a theme here, it is that children are bad for the health of smartphones). The company wanted to charge Buizer $150 to replace the screen on his $200 phone. He decided to replace the cracked screen himself using instructional videos on the Internet, a $20 replacement screen and a set of small drivers and pry tools. The surgery took just over an hour, but there was a small crack in the frame that held the glass. Over the past year and half, a fine white dust found its way into the phone through that crack, settling between the glass and touch pad, accumulating in the center of the screen where he scrolls most. ""I am guessing this is from static build up. Whatever causes it, I now have a hazy white spot directly in the center of my screen, said Buizer. ""Needless to say, I can't wait for my new iPhone to arrive."" Tinkering . Finally, there are the people who bring on the damage themselves. The tinkerers, the geeks, the dreamers. Designer Eliza Wee likes to mess with her devices, but admits she doesn't always know exactly what she's doing. The first time she tinkered under the hood of a smartphone, everything worked out just peachy. She decided to root her Evo phone (rooting is a way of getting total control of the operating system, bypassing pesky safeguards and limitations put in place by the company that made the phone). She also put a custom ROM -- a standalone, customized version of the Android operating system -- onto the phone. She got the phone to work on a different carrier and was quite pleased with the results. Her next phone was a Motorola Triumph. It was on Virgin Mobile, since she was on a mission to try out all the low-end phone carriers. She rooted the phone successfully again, but when she put on a custom ROM, something went horribly wrong. The external hard drive was no longer accessible and her phone was bricked. ""Genius that I am, I did all that two days before a work trip,"" said Wee. ""I went to the Sprint store, and signed my life away for two years, after being license-free for years."" iPhone 5 users complain about purple photos .","Forgetfulness, gravity and clumsiness are just a few ways to lose or ruin a phone .

"(RollingStone.com) -- Save for some bit roles in a smattering of unremarkable TV shows, the world hasn't heard much from Ben Savage since 2000. That's when his reign as Cory Matthews, the lovable goofball lead on the seminal Nineties sitcom ""Boy Meets World,"" came to an end. But last week, with one tweet, Savage returned to our lives: ""I'm going to be a father!"" the 32-year-old wrote. ""Well, on TV at least. The 'Boy Meets World' sequel is officially happening!"" Yes, much to the delight of twentysomething TGIF aficionados everywhere, ""Boy Meets World"" is getting a reboot. Titled ""Girl Meets World,"" the spinoff series, which is set to begin shooting in February and will air on the Disney Channel, stars both Savage and Danielle Fishel (as his wife, Topanga Lawrence) and follows the couple's experience raising a 13-year-old daughter. Rolling Stone needed more answers, so we rang up Savage to find which, if any, old cast members would be returning, and how he's preparing for impending fatherhood. Rolling Stone: Congratulations are in order. What has life been like since the Girl Meets World announcement? Ben Savage: It's been pretty . . . I'm gonna say pretty exciting. Let's leave it at that. RS: Are you surprised at how insanely happy people are about this? Savage: Well, it was very nice. I'll say it was exciting and flattering that people are still so excited about the show after all this time. 100 Best Albums of the Nineties . RS: The show's popularity is tied into people's Nineties-related nostalgia. How aware were you of the show's revered status among people of a certain age? Savage: I mean, I knew it was a highly-regarded show, and I know it holds a special place in people's hearts after all this time. Like I said, it's very flattering. But, you know, the other thing is, it was a big part of my childhood as well. As important as it is to a lot of fans and a lot of people who watched our show, it's just as important to me after all this time. It was an integral part of my life too, obviously. RS: Apparently it was a big part of Snooki's and Brooklyn Decker's, as well. Savage: It's a little ridiculous. It's very nice, though. All of it is very flattering. I know a lot of people grew up with that show. The funny thing is, back then -- and it sounds like I'm talking about some prehistoric age -- it was not long ago we didn't have as much options of cable television and Internet. And we were all kind of in the same place at one point just watching TGIF on Friday nights. And so, to a lot of people, this show means a lot. RS: Thanks to your role as Cory Matthews and your brother Fred's as Kevin Arnold on ""The Wonder Years,"" many people feel they know the Savage family on an intimate level. Savage: At the risk of using this word too often, it's flattering. And it's very nice that people think of us that way. It's nice that we have a special bond with the public. RS: Much of the show's success and continued popularity over the years is due to its ability to speak to both kids and adults. Savage: I guess it was kind of a hybrid of a kids' show and an adult show. We were just having fun on that show. Everyone was just kind of having a blast. The writers were a lot of fun. And the directors were always fun. And the acting was always fun. It was just a fun experience. So hopefully that came across to our viewers. At the same time, we tried to communicate some sort of message that was somewhat wholesome and had some sort of meaning. And I think people appreciate it. I think people can really appreciate a show with a good message, but one that does that with some humor. Nineties fashion gets a second spin . RS: Had the idea for a Boy Meets World sequel come up over the years? Savage: In an official capacity, no. This was really the first time where it had sort of been mentioned in an official way. I mean, people have been discussing it for a long time -- some sort of movie-of-the-week or some sort of, I guess, some sort of film about the show. But I think that everyone associated with the show wanted to make sure that if we were to come back, that we weren't going to do it in a way that was going to be a disservice to the show. No one wanted to really cash in, if you will, too early, or no one really wanted to do something that was going to be cheesy. So when we all decided to get together for this, there were a lot of discussions. I mean, this has been going on for months in an unofficial way. But the build-up to this Girl Meets World series, there was a lot of discussions and a lot of conversations to make sure we were all on the same page about what we were doing. RS: Were you hesitant to sign on? Savage: Let me say this: It wasn't that I was resistant . . . I think it was just a matter of making sure all of us were on the same page about what we were going to do in terms of making the show last another seven years, hopefully. There were different options around of following our characters or following this. But it just seems a little poetic that we're coming back 13 years later and it's following our daughter's character. I like that concept, because it's very poetic and it's kind of passing it off to the next generation. RS: The sequel wouldn't have worked without both you and Danielle Fishel returning. Savage: It was interesting how it came together. But Danielle and I had definitely had a lot of discussions of what we wanted to do, and if we were both onboard. Again, just making sure that everything was right and we felt right about it. Listen, the people that are doing the show -- Michael Jacobs is the executive producer -- they know what we're about, and they know what we're looking for. I guess it's also a matter of trust that we're all on the same page. ' 'Boy Meets World': Where are they now? RS: A lot of people are wondering if other original cast members, such as Rider Strong's Shawn or Bill Daniels' Mr. Feeny, will be back in the mix. Savage: We're going to wait and see what happens. Obviously, I don't want to give away too many details. But there's definitely been discussions about some of everyone's favorite characters popping up in the show and making appearances. We'll see what happens. RS: We'd like to see a return of Lee Norris' Stuart Minkus. Savage: [laughs] That's definitely an interesting way to go. I'm not sure when he stopped being on the show. I'm not sure, but I'm definitely in favor of a return of Minkus. Why not? RS: When do you start shooting? Savage: We start shooting, I think, February of next year. RS: Some people are worried the show will be a bust. Savage: We want to do justice to the characters, and we want to make sure we respect people's memories of the show. It's funny, a lot of the tweets and emails and mentions I've gotten are from a lot of people who are worried that the show wont' hold up. And that we shouldn't do it because it's going to ruin a lot of their childhood memories. And I totally can understand that -- I get it. I know there are things that they've done in the past where I feel like it's ruined my childhood memories. And I didn't like that. But we're really working hard and doing everything we can to make sure that this is going to be something special and funny, and hopefully it'll make new memories for a new generation. RS: How does it feel knowing you're about to be a father -- onscreen, that is? Savage: Well, I dunno [laughs]. In real life I've just been an uncle up to this point. Which has been great -- it's a nice role. We'll see how fatherhood works for me. Rolling Stone looks back on nineties with new anthology . RS: Maybe you can draw from your experiences as an uncle for the role. Savage: Perhaps. I think it's slightly different. Being an uncle is easy. You just get to stick around for the fun pasts. RS: No babies waking you up in the middle of the night. Savage: Exactly. RS: Have you started the casting process for the role of yours and Danielle's daughter? Savage: We're working on that right now. There have been a few names tossed around. We're meeting with girls and auditioning and that whole process. You know, we're slowly trying to find the perfect girl. RS: Lastly, how often do random strangers call you Cory? Savage: It's a bit of a humblebrag if I make that complaint. I'll just say, again, going back to our favorite word, it's always very flattering when people recognize me.

"(CNN) -- The nation has struggled with addressing how best to reduce gun violence following last month's tragic shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Responding to calls for gun control, the National Rifle Association attempted to shift blame for mass homicides away from guns to cultural influences such as video games or entertainment. No one can accuse the NRA of not being clever. At least not until it released a gun-themed shooting game less than a month after condemning the video game industry. In fairness, ""Practice Range,"" rated for ages 4 and up and free on the iPhone and iPad, is no blood-soaked, first-person shooter game. The trailer shows that it allows the player to engage in target practice using realistic-looking weapons. One of the weapon options appears to be an AR-15, the same weapon used at Newtown. The game also includes some gun safety tips. I have no objection to the game per se, although the NRA's app smacks of hypocrisy. Releasing a gun-themed shooting video game a month after the Newtown massacre reveals that the NRA doesn't even take its own claims seriously. As for the NRA's assertion that games create violence, it is nakedly self-serving. But, as queasy as the whole thing is, violent video games do not cause more violence. Several researchers, including myself, met with Vice President Joe Biden on Friday to inform him that studies are unable to support the contention that violent video games contribute to societal violence. Rather, it is untreated mental health symptoms that contribute to outcomes including youth violence, dating violence and bullying. As Fareed Zakaria aptly noted, nations that consume more video games per capita than the United States such as Japan, or share our media culture almost identically such as Canada, have much lower violence rates than our country. That's true even if you exclude gun violence and consider only simply assaults. And mass homicide perpetrators are no more likely to be gamers than the rest of us. Our society experiences confirmation bias, focusing on video games when the shooter is a young male, and ignoring video games when the shooter is an older male such as 62-year-old William Spengler, who shot two firefighters the week after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. This confirmation bias creates the false impression of a correlation where none exists. The NRA is apparently unaware that most theories of media effects make little distinction between a game such as ""Practice Range"" and one such as ""Grand Theft Auto."" According to such theories, seeing a picture of a gun or reading ""Grimm's Fairy Tales"" is as likely to stimulate aggression as a blood-soaked movie or game. Granted, the U.S. Supreme Court didn't buy that argument in 2011 when it considered a California law regulating the sale of violent games to minors, and criticized the quality of the research attempting to link violent games with aggression more broadly. I don't believe either ""Practice Range"" or ""Grand Theft Auto"" harms minors, although of course some games may have morally objectionable content. But the NRA can't claim, ""Video games create mass killers. Oh wait, hey, not this one!"" There are reasonable things we could do to reduce gun violence while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens to own guns. For example, better and more consistent background checks and required reporting by mental health professionals when patients make violent threats (requiring the removal of firearm licenses from those individuals) would go a long way. We can also put out public health campaigns to warn people of the risks of gun ownership so they could make informed decisions of their own without their constitutional rights being violated. Sensible changes will not occur if the nation indulges in a moral panic about violent video games as it did after the Columbine massacre. This, undoubtedly, would be exactly what the NRA would like to see happen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher J. Ferguson.","NRA releases shooting video game rated for ages 4 and up for free download .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- One recent afternoon, two 17-year-old migrant workers from the nearby province of Anhui came to an electronics market in this Chinese metropolis with one goal in mind: To purchase a smartphone. They browsed a couple of different models, before settling on a Samsung Galaxy Ace for 1,200 yuan (about $180). They traded in their old cell phones, good for nothing much more than making calls, sending text messages and maybe playing a few games. Read related: Seven ways mobile phones have changed lives in Africa . One of the migrants said he looked forward to watching movies on his new device. The other said he did not really know how to use such a gadget. Wang Shenyong, manager of the cell phone stall, said nearly all of his customers who have migrated to Shanghai from elsewhere for work are opting to purchase smartphones rather than low-budget fake phones that have long been a staple technology of China's marginalized populations. Read related: Your smartphone will (eventually) be hacked . ""The migrant workers are different than before,"" Wang said. ""They are more advanced now. They want a better life. They use these [smartphones] because they can know news very fast and share information with others."" China is on the verge of a smartphone revolution. Falling prices of handsets made by foreign brands paired with domestic manufacturers churning out cheaper and cheaper devices, combined with faster and more affordable data plans, means China will overtake the United States as the largest market for smartphones this year, according to market intelligence firm IDC. Read related: China 'passes U.S. in smartphone sales' Analysts expect the growth of the mobile Internet on the mainland to be game changing. Countless entrepreneurs are working to create applications and other software for the coming mobile web explosion that will be fueled by widespread smartphone adoption. Even simple handsets have enabled China's migrant workers to find jobs, communicate with family back home, organize into groups and access information. For migrant populations, such technology has served to ""liberate workers culturally"" and ""restructure the social identity"" of migrants, according to Pui-lam Law, editor of ""New Connectivities in China: Virtual, Actual and Local Interactions."" It is hard to say how many migrants now have smartphones. Anecdotal evidence suggests their uptake, especially among younger migrants in urban areas, is quickly becoming widespread and that the technology is enabling them to connect with broader segments of Chinese society in ways they never have before. ""China has long had a very active, even militant, working class,"" said Jack Linchuan Qiu, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's communication and journalism school, who researches information and communication technologies and their impact on labor movements in China. ""They have always been socially engaged but usually they stay under the radar, but now there is a new window for us to see what is going on."" That new window is specifically Sina Weibo, China's largest microblog, most commonly referred to as a mainstream social media channel for the middle class. Now migrant workers are starting to take part, and in some instances people are paying attention. This summer, for example, a migrant NGO successfully stopped the closure of a school for migrant children in Beijing after posting their grievances on Sina Weibo. Public intellectuals, television hosts, even state-run media, became involved in supporting their cause. ""This is all possible because they have smartphones,"" Qiu said. ""But the most essential ingredient is the workers want to have their voices heard, and they are facing existential issues. Technology is of no use if no one has the political will."" Qiu said similar efforts to stop recent government crackdowns on workers' rights groups in the southern province of Guangzhou have not been as successful. ""The Beijing case -- that was a rare case,"" he said. ""It was almost like a little miracle."" Read related: Mobile phones used to get past China's Internet censors . Nevertheless, more migrants, particularly those in factories, are creating what Qiu calls ""worker generated content"" about their working conditions and sharing it with wider audiences. Some migrants are garnering thousands of fans on microblogs where they share personal experiences and feelings that have rarely been voiced outside their immediate social circles - if at all. ""Am going to bed now,"" posted one migrant who writes under the name ""Blue Piano"" on Sina Weibo. ""Good night to this hypocritical, pretentious, two-faced world. Step on another's head in order to get to the top. Keep on fighting tomorrow."" Read related: Ex-Apple boss tackles poverty in India with mobile technology . ""Stay home. Marry. Farming.

""It is not a dramatic change yet in that sense. They are still marginalized. It is only under particular circumstances they get the spotlight, but what we are seeing is a big sign of what could happen further down the road.""","Smartphone use on the rise in China amid falling handset prices and cheaper call plans .

"(CNN) -- Members of the law enforcement community must sound their voices in support of comprehensive immigration reform for the sake of public safety and for the sake of our country. I write this as a former police chief in Mesa, Arizona, who now serves as the district attorney of San Francisco. I am an immigrant who came to the United States from Cuba at age 13, as my family sought democracy and freedom. I cherish the history and values of our nation and hope that Congress, as it debates immigration reform, will courageously embody the best of our country, enact a humane solution to bring 11 million unauthorized immigrants out of the shadows and fully integrate them into American society. In the absence of federal action, states have taken immigration law into their own hands, implementing laws that drive a wedge between law enforcement and the people we are sworn to serve. A new study commissioned by Policy Link found that 45% of Latinos in Chicago's Cook County, Houston's Harris County, Los Angeles and Phoenix's Maricopa County were less likely to report crime because they fear police will inquire about their immigration status. More disturbing is that 70% of undocumented immigrants surveyed reported they are less likely to contact police if they are victims of crime. When immigrants -- unauthorized or authorized - feel isolated from the protection of law enforcement, the entire community suffers. I saw this evidenced during my tenure as police chief in Mesa, Arizona, where local Sheriff Joe Arpaio's reign of terror over the Latino community led to increased crime rates in his county. Arpaio blamed most crimes in Maricopa Country on undocumented immigrants and made racial profiling a common practice. He frequently detained people who ""looked Latino"" until they could prove their status in the country. In direct contrast to this approach, I worked side by side with community groups and civil rights organizations to foster a sense of trust between the Latino community and the Mesa Police Department. The effects of a broken immigration system were a constant thread in the stories of Latino mothers, fathers and workers who refused to report crime for fear of being detained or deported. In Mesa, we lowered crime by some 30%, according to FBI data -- a result of the trust our police department created with all communities, and not because of immigration enforcement. Law enforcement should focus on community safety, not enforcing immigration laws. That is not just my opinion, but that of the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled against Arizona's SB1070, and of many police officers and law enforcement officials around the country. When undocumented immigrants live in the shadows, they become wary of law enforcement, crimes go unreported, perpetrators remain on the loose, and the safety of our communities is affected. Anti-immigrant forces have long scapegoated undocumented immigrants as the reason for higher crime rates and the need for greater border security. We in law enforcement must come together and inform our senators that immigrants are a valuable part of our communities. Research shows that areas with a high immigrant population often have much lower rates of crime than similar areas without high immigrant representation. Our borders are also more secure than they have ever been, with the United States already spending more than $17 billion annually on immigration and border enforcement. While it is important to control access to our nation and keep track of those who visit or come to work, establishing complete border security should not hold hostage the rest of the needed changes: Immigration reform means both border security and a sensible path to citizenship for aspiring Americans, instead of a narrow focus on just enforcement. As the immigration bill moves through Congress, the law enforcement community must lend its voice to demanding real comprehensive reform of our immigration system. We must rally around the most important aspect of the legislation -- an honest pathway to citizenship, not one filled with landmines, for the majority of aspiring Americans who already contribute to our economy and our communities. The time is now. Passing comprehensive immigration reform will make our communities safer and make our country stronger. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of George GascÃ³n.","George Gascon: Law enforcement should lend support to immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- When I was 8, I joined the Boy Scouts. I lasted three weeks--couldn't get the hang of all that knot tying, and no one was interested in singing show tunes around the campfire. I was gay and I knew it. At that time, revealing my sexual identity would have resulted in my exclusion from Scouting. Until the Boy Scouts of America's historic May 23 vote -- which allows gay youth to join the scouts, but upholds the ban on gay adult leaders -- thousands of boys across the country faced similar discrimination from the Scouts, who actively and vocally banned gays. The Scouts' decision to include gay youth is part of the sea change sweeping across the United States on the issue of gay equality, an issue that has long centered on equal rights for all. But discrimination, in the Boy Scouts as in every walk of life, brings with it another effect that is left out of the conversation on rights: poorer health. Hiding one's sexual identity and being excluded from activities and social groups causes stress, and research shows this can have a significant impact on health. In her review of the health of gay youth, Tumaini Coker notes that gay youth are three times more likely to partake in substance abuse, and that adolescents who said they felt stigmatized -- for example, in the form of family rejection -- are five times more likely to experience depression. Still, this is an area that, unfortunately, has not been well studied. On the rare occasions that this link is discussed, the academic community has tended to focus on adults. But the health effects on young people who are stigmatized is surely as significant. My own recent research, published in the American Journal of Men's Health, drew on a sample of 1,000 gay men from Atlanta, and showed that gay men who reported that they heard statements such as ""being gay is not normal"" in their youth were more likely as adults to have unprotected sex and to have sex while intoxicated or high. The study is among the first to demonstrate associations between stigma induced stress in childhood and negative health behaviors as adults that put them at risk for HIV infection. There is already ample evidence to suggest that adult gay men and women experience poorer health relative to straight people. Opinion: Boy Scouts' decision makes no sense . For one thing, gay men have been more heavily affected by the AIDS epidemic than the general population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2006 and 2009, gay men -- and other men who have sex with men -- were the only risk group to experience an increase in HIV incidence. There also is a wealth of data showing that gay men and women are more likely to engage in smoking, alcohol and drug use, and experience poorer mental health. A study of 577 gay adults by Sean McCabe and colleagues at the University of Michigan showed that gay adults who experience discrimination are nearly four times more likely to experience substance abuse disorders, while Diana Burgess and colleagues at the University of Minnesota noted that compared with heterosexuals, gay adults are 68% more likely to experience depression and 56% more likely to experience anxiety. Ilan Meyer, a senior scholar at UCLA's School of Law, offers an explanation for these disparities through the ""Theory of Minority Stress,"" which suggests that these health inequities may be rooted in discrimination, with negative health behaviors acting as coping mechanisms for repeated exposure to stigma-related stress. Opinion: My take: Why my family is quitting the Boy Scouts . As impressionable children we internalize messages we receive about what is right, what is normal, what we are allowed to be -- each shaping our views about our sexual identity and whether we ""belong."" Being exposed to messages that same-sex relationships are not ""normal"" is damaging. These messages set scripts for youth to follow, divide them into normal and abnormal, and arm bullies with justification to harm them. As my own research shows, these messages have lasting impacts Ã¢â¬â sometimes fatal -- on health behaviors as adults. The consequences for youth are painfully illustrated by the It Gets Better Project, created by writer Dan Savage in 2010 to give gay youth hope that life will be easier as a gay adult. Savage developed the project in response to the high rates of suicide among gay youth. Research indeed shows that gays are significantly more likely to attempt suicide compared with heterosexual youth (21.5% vs 4.2%), and that among gay youth, the risk of attempting suicide is 20% greater in unsupportive environments compared with supportive environments. Being told we are different at an age when we are trying to establish who we are can be devastating. But what if it didn't have to get better? What if it could be better from the start? Last week the Boy Scouts sent an important signal to gay youth: You are not different. But it is not quite enough. The ban on gay Scout leaders remains. Last week, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, withdrew his proposed amendment to provide U.S. citizens the right to sponsor their same-sex partners for green cards. And in June the Supreme Court will vote on the Defense of Marriage Act. Each inequity sends a message to young people that they can expect not to be treated equally when they grow up, setting them on the pathway to lowered self-esteem and poorer health. Perhaps it is time to examine how we are treating America's gay youth through that lens. By creating equality, we can create better health Ã¢â¬â right from the start. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rob Stephenson.","Rob Stephenson: Boy Scouts allowing gay members a good step for health of gay youth .

"(CNN) -- Americans shouldn't expect to see the 62,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan come home any time soon, no matter who is declared the victor in the country's presidential election. U.S. Marines patrol near Herat, Afghanistan, in July. In fact, the Pentagon is planning to add 6,000 troops by the end of the year. Ballot counting continued Friday, a day after Afghans went to the polls in the nation's second presidential election since the 2001 fall of the Taliban, the strict Islamic theocracy that emerged from the country's civil war in the 1990s. Pre-election polls showed President Hamid Karzai and his former foreign minister, Abdullah Abdullah, as the front-runners. U.S. policy would hold course under either, experts said. Moreover, a senior U.S. military official said last month that Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, was expected to request even more U.S. troops be sent there. But Defense Secretary Robert Gates has signaled he'd like to wait and gauge the impact of the full 68,000 troops first. President Obama on Friday emphasized that the United States does not favor any particular candidate. ""Our goal is clear: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and their extremist allies,"" he said. ""That goal will be achieved -- and our troops will be able to come home -- as Afghans continue to strengthen their own capacity and take responsibility for their own future."" Earlier this month, Gates said it would take ""a few years"" to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda, the terror network behind the 9/11 attacks that was given haven under Taliban rule. Gates further said it was a ""mystery"" how long U.S. troops would remain in Afghanistan. Officials have told U.S. Senate investigators that any progress in Afghanistan will be ""incremental"" and could take between two and 10 years. October 7 will mark the war's eighth anniversary. Almost 800 U.S. troops have died in Afghanistan since the war began, including more than 110 this year. The United States has spent more than $220 billion on Afghanistan since 2001. It is now spending about $4 billion a month. U.S. troops in the country took a back seat to Afghan security forces during Thursday's balloting, but one U.S. soldier was killed in a mortar strike Thursday.  Watch how Afghans went to the polls Thursday Â» . Obama has made Afghanistan a centerpiece of his foreign policy, saying ignoring the country or leaving it to fend for itself poses a direct threat of another 9/11-style attack. ""This is not a war of choice; this is a war of necessity. Those who attacked America on 9/11 are plotting to do so again,"" Obama said this week. Daniel Markey, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, put it in softer but similar terms. ""We should care about [U.S.] troops, but we should also care about stability in Afghanistan so we don't see a return to something that looks like pre-9/11 Afghanistan,"" he said. Not everyone agrees. Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, said he's not convinced that ousting the Taliban from Afghanistan would make the U.S. safer. Terrorists will find other havens, he said, and there's no guarantee that a Taliban ouster from Afghanistan would be permanent. ""The military and police force we're trying to create is going to cost substantially more than the Afghan budget,"" Walt said. Also, he said, the Taliban of today is not the Taliban of 2001. It's more a loose coalition of small groups than a broad, unified organization, he said. In an article published this week in Foreign Policy, Walt drew parallels to the Soviet Union's departure from Afghanistan in 1989. ""The mujaheddin didn't 'follow them home,' "" he wrote of the Afghan fighters who pushed out the Soviets. ""Were the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan and the Taliban to regain power (or end up sharing power, which is more likely), going after the United States won't even be on their 'to do' list.""","NEW: President Obama says U.S. goal remains defeating al Qaeda, its allies .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Senate, the ""world's greatest deliberative body,"" with a reputation for gridlock that surpasses even that of my native Los Angeles, on Thursday passed an immigration reform bill by a bipartisan majority. Please thank the Senate. As the fight moves to the House of Representatives, it's a good time to reflect on just what this bill will mean for America and to redouble our efforts to pass it. The last major immigration reform bill was in 1986 under President Reagan. I was 3, my parents had just bought their first computer and the World Wide Web was a dream. Many of today's great tech companies were not yet on the radar screen. Our country has changed a lot during those 27 years, but not -- so far -- our immigration policy. Suffice it to say, if we can pass our generation's immigration reform, it will be a really big deal. America's greatest asset has always been its people, drawn here from all over the world. In the 21st century, our economic future depends on immigrants more than ever. The fastest-growing sector of our economy is the knowledge economy, where the main competitive difference is people. How immigration reform would affect 3 families . In a globalized world where people and businesses have their choice of countries to locate in, continuing to have the best trained, hardest-working and most productive people in the world will keep the United States at the forefront of global competitiveness. We have some huge advantages: the top universities in the world, the top scientific researchers, and -- right alongside these -- our identity as a nation of immigrants and descendants of immigrants. At FWD.us, a nonprofit advocacy group, we are entrepreneurs, and we believe that one of the main reasons America is the leading entrepreneurial nation is that we are a nation of immigrants. Leaving behind your home country and everything you know to create a better life for your family is the essence of the risk-taking that characterizes the entrepreneurial ethos. I think back to my ancestors in the shtetls of Eastern Europe in the 19th century. They had probably never been more than two miles from their village, and got on a steamship to go to a country they had never even seen in a picture, knowing they would never return home. That is truly putting it all on the line to make a better life. It is not random, who chooses to emigrate, and the work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit of these immigrants have shaped the character of our country. Entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley do not just identify with the experience of computer programmers coming to America to work at tech companies, but with everyone who comes here to make a better life. It's why we are working for comprehensive immigration reform. There are talented young people in America who were brought here by their parents who now cannot go to college or work because they are undocumented. These DREAMers are just waiting to contribute, and their parents, with the right accountability measures, should be able to join them by coming out of the shadows and contributing fully to their communities. Opinion: On immigration, GOP offers fear, not ideas . In addition, we know that the best and the brightest come here to study, start companies and create jobs that grow our economy; millions more are caught in limbo navigating a complex and broken system that is totally outdated for a modern economy and modern American families. We need to pass comprehensive immigration reform to unlock those contributions and by doing so change millions of lives. FWD.us has been visiting college graduations, talking with some of the smart young international graduates who have the potential to expand American businesses and create new innovations here. Many are returning home despite job offers in the United States, for one reason -- they can't get visas. A loss for them and a loss for us -- collateral damage of an outdated immigration policy. Over our history, the United States has often been good at welcoming immigrants. In fact, it's part of what defines America. Reagan said it well, recounting the sentiments in a letter he received from a man before he left office: ""You can go live in France, but you cannot become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Italy, but you can't become a German, an Italian. He went through Turkey, Greece, Japan and other countries. But he said anyone, from any corner of the world, can come to live in the United States and become an American."" Comprehensive immigration reform is a big deal, but it is not a done deal. The House comes next. We are at a hinge moment for America. Don't hold back -- the time is here to be heard as the fight continues to pass meaningful comprehensive immigration reform. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joe Green.","Joe Green: Immigration reform heads for tough fight in House after passing in Senate .

"(CNN) -- Motivation is a tricky thing. We need it in every aspect of our lives: to get up in the morning and go to work, to start (and finish) that 10-page paper, to do laundry after a long day. Yet the motivation to get healthy often eludes us. It hides in the form of excuses -- excuses for why we can't go to the gym or cook a healthy meal, why we can't get enough sleep or make time for ourselves. Often we lack motivation because we lack inspiration. Why I became a triathlete . Every year CNN selects iReporters to race in a triathlon with Dr. Sanjay Gupta and the Fit Nation team. This year we're giving six lucky readers a road bike (with all the necessary accessories), a wet suit and a gym membership to help them prepare for the Nautica Malibu Triathlon on September 8. As they train for their first triathlon with support from our fitness and nutrition coaches, they'll blog, tweet and share their workouts online. You'll watch as they get ready to swim a half-mile in the ocean, bike 18 miles and run 4 miles along the Pacific coast. We hope this year's Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge team will inspire you to make your own health a priority. Whether it's being a role model for your kids, accomplishing a personal goal or simply being able to enjoy life, find your motivation for getting fit and eating better. If our past Fit Nation team members are any indication, you'll be happy you did.Meet this year's team: . Douglas Mogle . Douglas Mogle was tailgating at a Notre Dame game in October 2011 when he started feeling ill. On his way out of the parking lot, he passed out and fell down face first. At 31 years old, he had gone into sudden cardiac arrest. ""I have a confession to make,"" Mogle wrote in his first blog for Fit Nation. ""I was petrified of not being selected to the CNN Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge. Seriously, petrified. ""It seemed as though everyone who applied to the challenge was going to 'Start this new way of life,' regardless of being selected or not. They were motivated. They had obtainable goals. They had a plan. I, on the other hand, was shaking in my boots. I was not ready to face the reality of trying to live a healthier lifestyle by myself, again."" A fourth-grade teacher from Atlanta, Mogle is now ready to follow his own advice to his students: You have to work really, really hard to reach success. ""I'm in this for the long term, and failure is not an option. I'll do whatever my CNN Fit Nation coaches and mentors ask me to do. I'll follow their workouts, their eating plans and everything in between. Will it be easy? No, probably not. But 'they' usually say that nothing worthwhile ever is."" Hear more of Mogle's story . Will Cleveland . Will Cleveland grew up in the military, traveling from country to country with his family. As an adult, the Atlanta man became a soldier himself. Looking back on his childhood has motivated the 28-year-old single father to become a role model for his son. That includes quitting smoking, a bad habit he picked up after leaving the Army. ""I want to stay living as long as possible in order to experience this world in its entirety,"" Cleveland wrote. ""I want to be around when my son has a chance to see the world, and I want to be there to guide him and teach him right from wrong. ... If it makes any sense, I would say just by seeing what I have seen thus far, I know there is much more to see. ""I know this training and competing will be painful and mentally stressful, but if he sees that his father was able to finish something he set out for, maybe he will think he can do the same thing and strive to be the best."" Hear more of Cleveland's story . Annette Miller . Annette Miller wanted to join the basketball team when she was 10 years old. Permission slip in hand, she excitedly told her parents about her plans -- but, she says, they told her she was too fat to play. ""Those five words impacted my life more than I could ever know,"" Miller wrote on her iReport submission. ""For the past 20-plus years I've been 'too fat to' do a lot of things."" The tipping point came when Miller's twin sister needed a kidney transplant. Doctors wouldn't even test Miller to see if she was a match because she was obese. Since then, Miller has lost more than 100 pounds. ""I've seen how my body has changed and how strong I'm getting and it amazes me,"" the Nashville resident wrote. ""My way of thinking and seeing myself are still works in progress. Many days I feel like the 10-year-old that just wanted to play basketball, and I still hear 'You're too fat to play.' ""I need to be able to run across the finish line and be able to call myself a triathlete. Completing this challenge with the 2013 Fit Nation team will do more for me mentally and emotionally than any amount of weight I can ever lose."" Hear more of Miller's story . Stacy Mantooth . ""I barely recognize the person I've become,"" Stacy Mantooth wrote in his first blog. ""Who is this fat guy staring back at me in the mirror? Apparently watching sports on TV doesn't actually count as exercise. Who knew?!"" Mantooth is a big fan of triathlons. He has volunteered at several in his hometown of Las Vegas. Watching from the sidelines, he wished he could be one of the athletes crossing the finish line. ""But how could such an unhealthy person become a triathlete?"" he asked himself. ""The journey seemed so overwhelming, but every one of those athletes, from the pros to the Joes, had to start somewhere, right?"" Thanks to encouragement from his girlfriend, Mantooth will soon get to cross the finish line in Malibu. ""I know that success and real change will come from hard work, but I'm committed to the miles of training that lie ahead,"" he wrote. ""I'm ready to finally improve -- and downsize -- the person I see in the mirror."" Hear more of Mantooth's story . Tabitha McMahon . Life hasn't been easy for Tabitha McMahon. At just 19 years old, the Indianapolis resident was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. Symptoms forced her to quit school, and she spent several years in and out of hospitals. ""Blood transfusions, broken bones, mono, pneumonia, incontinence, painful joints, significant weight loss followed by significant weight gain, major abdominal surgeries and a temporary ileostomy left me physically weary and nearly defeated,"" McMahon wrote on her iReport submission. ""Nearly defeated"" is the key phase. After having her colon removed in emergency surgery, McMahon slowly recovered -- marrying her college sweetheart, earning her degree, starting work in the nonprofit world and adopting a baby. Now she has her eyes set on new goals. ""First and foremost, I want to get fit. I want to lose these extra pounds and be healthy and active every day. I want to live a long life for my husband and 7-year-old daughter. ""I also want to reduce stigma around UC and other digestive disease(s). As you might imagine, this is not the stuff of cocktail party chatter. However, 1.4 million Americans suffer silently from inflammatory bowel disease. It's pretty astounding. ""I have spent many years convincing myself that to be active I can only work out in a gym or at home -- somewhere near a bathroom. ... No more. It's time to face these fears head on. It's time to get out of the gym and on the road."" Hear more of McMahon's story . Rae Timme . Rae Timme, a long-time prison warden for the Colorado Department of Corrections, will retire two weeks after the Nautica Malibu Triathlon. She's excited about her retirement, but wants to be in shape so she can enjoy quality time with her husband, three kids and seven grandkids. ""I have ... learned the past few years how truly precious life is, and that none of us can take our health for granted,"" Timme, of Pueblo West, Colorado, wrote in her blog. ""I have lost my sister, my brother, both of my parents. I am the oldest of the four kids that my parents had -- our younger brother died of leukemia when we were kids -- and the only one that survived them. Sadly, the primary causes of death for my brother and sister were preventable."" Timme has read scary statistics about her profession: People who work in corrections have the second highest mortality rate of any job; on average, a corrections officer's 58th birthday will be their last. That motivated her to apply for the CNN Fit Nation team. ""I am a literal bundle of emotions,"" Timme wrote in the days leading up to the kick-off weekend trip. ""I am excited beyond belief, humbled to have been selected from so many applicants, scared to death about being able to keep up with the youngsters on the team, and terrified of having to wear the tri shorts that came in the mail today in public.

"Washington (CNN) -- Planned Parenthood can continue to receive Medicaid funding in Indiana, after the U.S. Supreme Court denied an appeal by the state on Tuesday. The justices let stand a lower court decision that had blocked patient reimbursement through Medicaid for health providers that perform abortions as part of overall medical care. That would include private groups like Planned Parenthood that fund its abortion care independently. Planned Parenthood said it served 85,000 patients statewide in 2011. Of those, 5,580 received abortions, but most were given basic reproductive health care, including contraceptives and health screenings. A federal appeals court last year permanently blocked enforcement of the Indiana law, ruling that Medicaid regulations clearly give program participants the power to select their own qualified health care provider. Indiana officials asked the Supreme Court to intervene, but the justices declined without comment. Medicaid is a nationwide health program for low-income patients that is funded primarily by the federal government but administered by the states. Federal law bans Medicaid funds to pay for abortions in most instances, but Indiana's law went further. The measure specifically blocked the Indiana Department of Health from signing contracts with any group performing abortions, with the exception of hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. The controversial law was allowed to go into effect in 2011 by a federal judge hours after it was approved by then-Gov. Mitch Daniels. In signing the bill, Daniels and other state officials said other options existed for Medicaid patients seeking reproductive health care. But the appeals court later weighed in and reversed it. There was no immediate reaction to the high court denial from current Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. But Planned Parenthood, which bills itself as the ""nation's leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and advocate,"" applauded the move. ""Over and over again, courts have said that states cannot block people from getting preventive health care at Planned Parenthood, and the vast majority of the American public agrees,"" said Cecile Richards, president of the nonprofit's Action Fund. The funding issue is not isolated to Indiana. Courts around the country have blocked similar laws aimed at Planned Parenthood in Arizona, Kansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee. But the group has experienced legal setbacks in Oklahoma and Texas. The high court cases are Planned Parenthood of Indiana v. Secretary of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (12-1159); and Secretary of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana (12-1039).","Justices let stand appeals court ruling that had rejected Indiana law .

"(CNN) -- As Mayor Michael Bloomberg vowed would happen, the New York City Law Department has filed an appeal after a New York judge scrapped the city's controversial ban on big containers of soda. ""Consistent with our desire to get a quick appellate review, the city filed its brief with the appeals court this week,"" said Fay Ng, senior counsel for the department's appeals division, in a written statement. ""The sugary drinks proposal is an important part of the mayor's health initiative."" The Board of Health regulation would limit the size of drinking cups for sugary beverages to a maximum of 16 ounces at city food service establishments. The regulation was adopted in September to help lower obesity rates, but a state Supreme Court judge overturned it as ""arbitrary and capricious."" Dozens of community groups and minority organizations signed on to friend-of-the-court, or amicus, briefs in support of the appeal, said Bloomberg, Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Linda I. Gibbs and Health Commissioner Thomas A. Farley, in a news release. Sugary drinks linked to 180,000 deaths worldwide . ""The organizations and individuals who have joined these amicus briefs understand the toll that obesity is taking on communities here in New York City and across the nation,"" Bloomberg said. ""Sugary drinks are a leading contributor to the obesity epidemic that is hitting low-income communities especially hard, and we cannot afford to pretend otherwise. Our plan to limit the portion size of sugary drinks is a sensible step that has won increasing levels of support from the public health community."" The city says that obesity-related illness kills more than 5,000 New Yorkers each year. ""The health consequences of obesity are dire, leading to diabetes, cancer and loss of life,"" Gibbs said. ""The real fear that today's youth may be the first generation to live shorter lives than their parents is a call to action."" One of the friend-of-the-court briefs, which were to be filed Friday, focuses on evidence showing a correlation between sugary drink consumption and obesity and chronic diseases, along with their disproportionate impact on underserved communities, the news release said. Some 20% of New York City public school children are obese and another 20% are overweight, according to the city. Latino children are twice as likely as white children to be obese (23.5% vs. 12.3%). ""It's time to say enough! (ÃÂ¡basta!) and put community and children's health first,"" said Dr. Jane L. Delgado, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health. 'Anti-Bloomberg' bill stops overregulation . The limitations on cup size have provoked ridicule from some people. ""I think this is what makes liberals look like elitist bullies who think they know everything and can tell people what to do,"" Bill Maher said on his HBO show ""Real Time."" ""You shouldn't have to clear what you eat with the municipal government."" An executive with the National Restaurant Association -- which represents 500,000 restaurant businesses across the country -- called the city's efforts at change ""heavy-handed"" and was effervescent over Bloomberg's most recent loss in court. ""We very much questioned the efficacy of putting a dent in obesity by restricting the cup size in restaurants in New York City that sold sugar-sweetened beverages,"" said Scott DeFife, the association's executive vice president for policy and governmental affairs, in an interview this month. ""We don't think that micromanaging food service packaging is the way to end obesity in New York City."" Bloomberg's attempt to limit the size of sodas inspired Mississippi -- whose 34.9% obesity rate is the nation's highest -- to pass an ""anti-Bloomberg"" law. ""It simply is not the role of the government to micro-regulate citizens' dietary decisions,"" Gov. Phil Bryant wrote this month. But Bloomberg has been undeterred. ""'Saturday Night Live' couldn't write this stuff,"" he said recently about Mississippi's move. ""We have a worldwide, nationwide problem on obesity. This year, more people will die from overeating than from starvation -- first time in the history of the world."" ""How can somebody try to pass a law that deliberately says we can't improve the lives of our citizens?"" he asked. ""It's farce."" Arguments are scheduled for June.

"(CNN) -- Growing up near the South Side of Chicago, a good portion of my youth was spent on the fields or on the courts. Whether it was baseball in the summer or basketball in the winter, being an athlete pretty much defined my existence. Sports were the No. 1 thing I cared about. (It didn't hurt that Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls were in pursuit of their six NBA championships at the time.) Needless to say, staying in shape and getting enough exercise were not problems I had to deal with. In high school, my participation in sports meant more training. Practices and workouts were exhaustive and took up a good portion of my afternoons and evenings. Playing sports helped me develop friendships, hone my skills and stay in great shape. Once again, getting enough exercise was not a problem. Then I hit the ripe old age of 22. Get fit and others will follow . After high school, my fitness levels began to decline. Besides my poor eating habits, I attribute this to one factor: I'd been benched. My access to team sports was dwindling, and there was an extreme unlikelihood that the NFL and NBA would be knocking on my door any time soon. Daily practices and games were replaced by long work hours, dinner out with friends and nights in front of the TV. I joined weekend sports leagues where beer, not winning, was the primary goal. (Not that I complained.) Staying in shape and getting enough exercise were now big problems. T-shirt tales: The athlete I used to be . I was not prepared to enter the world of individual sports in order to stay active. I found going on a ""long"" run or swimming laps in the pool to be quite boring. Where were my teammates? Where were the screaming coaches? Throughout my life, the concept of ""team"" had been stressed on a daily basis, and now it was nowhere to be found. I realized that I needed to find a team. I needed to be a part of something bigger than myself. Believe it or not, my biggest reason for applying to the CNN Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge was not the free bike or the cool gear. Rather, I loved the idea that we would be competing in the triathlon in Malibu as a team: six people, from all parts of the country, coming together for one goal. The journey thus far would not have been possible without my Fit Nation teammates and coaches. I rely on them daily for their motivation, their expertise and their unwavering support. Getting fit for the family I love . Being a part of a team has always played a large role in my success as an athlete, on and off the field. The camaraderie and accountability present within a team setting are things I have been unable to replicate when going at it alone. My sudden cardiac arrest in October 2011 created a daily reminder of my health and my need for exercise, but my selection to the CNN Fit Nation team pushed me to think deeper about where I am right now, where I've been and where I hope to go. My team is the reason I'll complete my workout this afternoon, and my team is the reason I will cross the finish line in September.

"New York (CNN) -- The nurses involved in a maternity ward scuffle with Douglas Kennedy should be investigated and disciplined, Kennedy's lawyers say. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy's son, was arrested and faces misdemeanor charges over the melee at a New York hospital last month in which he knocked down a nurse while he was holding his newborn son. ""The only issue is the aggressive and unprofessional conduct of two nurses,"" attorney Robert Gottlieb said in a letter sent this week to the hospital. Gottlieb said the Kennedys have asked that a ""thorough investigation be undertaken immediately of the nurses involved in this disgraceful incident and that appropriate disciplinary action taken against them."" Kennedy was arraigned last week on harassment and child endangerment charges, attorneys for both sides have said. Kennedy -- a Fox News contributor -- was trying to take his newborn son for a walk ""to get fresh air"" outside Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco on January 7 when two nurses intervened to prevent him from leaving, they said. Kennedy, who was accompanied by a hospital doctor, allegedly twisted the arm of one nurse to move her away from a door and kicked another after she approached him, according to Elliot Taub, the attorney for both nurses. The doctor who accompanied Kennedy, Timothy Haydock, who is a longtime family friend, said the nurses had initially agreed to let Kennedy take the baby outside. ""The nurses were the only aggressors,"" Haydock said in a statement delivered by Kennedy's attorney. But Taub said neither nurse recognized Kennedy as the child's father and intended to protect the baby, who apparently had not been discharged. They were trying to enforce hospital rules, Taub said. Northern Westchester Hospital issued a statement Monday in support of the nurses. ""At Northern Westchester Hospital, patient safety is our priority and we completely support the actions of our nursing staff in this case as they were clearly acting out of concern for the safety of a newborn baby."" Kennedy has denied the allegations, saying that ""the nurse had no right to grab our child out of his father's arms."" The late Robert F. Kennedy was the younger brother of slain President John F. Kennedy and had served as U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator. He was assassinated in 1968 while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination.

"(CNN) -- Have you heard the one about the Justice Department's $16 muffins? Probably not, though even if you have, this latest revelation of workaday government waste has long since lost its capacity to shock. And therein lies the real problem. For those catching up: The DOJ's OIG (Office of Inspector General) Tuesday released an audit showing that the department spent nearly $500,000 for food and beverages at just 10 Justice-sponsored conferences in 2008 and 2009. ""One conference,"" auditors found, ""served $16 muffins while another served Beef Wellington hors d'oeuvres that cost $7.32 per serving. Coffee and tea at the events cost between $0.62 and $1.03 an ounce. At the $1.03 per-ounce price, an 8-ounce cup of coffee would have cost $8.24."" Some outrage at this routine squandering of taxpayer money predictably ensued, but so did not a small amount of eye-rolling and mirth. The Baltimore Sun editorial board, for example, said that while ""Wasteful government spending deserves to be condemned in the strongest terms possible"" (the Sun's preferred strong terms being ""Washington chokes on its muffins""), the overspending is ""far from the cause of nation's deficit."" This is true, as far as it goes. The nation's current and future deficit is driven overwhelmingly by health care, military and retirement spending, each of which involve ever-increasing promises that have proved politically career-threatening to scale back. That's why politicians prefer instead to talk about $16 muffins and $600 toilet seats -- it's the least expensive way to simulate fiscal responsibility. The boy who cries muffin while signing onto every new major entitlement and military adventure is not in any position to deliver lectures about tax-dollar stewardship. And never forget that the spending frenzy is distinctly bipartisan: Even alleged fiscal radical Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, voted for the Troubled Assets Relief Program, the Iraq War and Medicare Part D. So should we just greet muffinflation with a weary shrug? Not remotely, no. The lesson of government waste, whether on $16 muffins or $535 million loan guarantees to solar power companies or $48 billion in ""improper"" Medicare payments, is one worth relearning every day. Managers whose budgets do not depend on customer satisfaction and who do not face competitive pressure in the marketplace, will not, on balance, spend their money wisely. Vendors selling to those managers know that price matters much less than it does to, say, Wal-Mart. And anywhere there is political urgency and official involvement high up the command chain, conditions will begin resembling a gold rush. As major Solyndra investor and Barack Obama donor George Kaiser told a crowd of his fellow Oklahomans not long after Obama's stimulus was announced in 2009, ""There's never been more money shoved out of the government's door in world history and probably never will be again than in the last few months and the next 18 months. And our selfish, parochial goal is to get as much of it for Tulsa and Oklahoma as we possibly can."" There is no such thing as war without the brutal, violent death of innocents, including children. Similarly, there is no such thing as government spending without gobs of disgusting waste, graft and corruption. It's all cooked right into the system. That's why muffin-cynicism troubles me most. The same Baltimore Sun that can decry such waste in one breath, will invite it in its next: ""Let Congress vent its spleen and deal with whoever is responsible for the Justice Department's very poor judgment,"" the editorial board wrote. ""Then it should get back to the business of creating jobs and stimulating the weak economy in the short-run and adopting sensible economic policy that reduces the deficit in the long-term."" As long as we believe that government is good at creating jobs and stimulating the economy, we're going to be stuffed by much more than just $16 muffins. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matt Welch.","A report criticized Justice Department for extravagant spending .
Matt Welch says it's natural to make light of the $16 muffin .

"London (CNN) -- A tiny nano-sized car which can propel itself forward in response to electrical pulses has been created by scientists in the Netherlands.

Its maiden journey wasn't exactly epic -- six nanometers -- and its fuel-efficiency wasn't world-beating either, needing a jolt of 500 millivolts every half revolution of its wheels. But it's an important milestone in nanotech research (the science of manipulating matter at molecular scale), say scientists, because it demonstrates that single molecules can absorb external electrical energy and turn this into targeted motion. ""To build the nanotechnology of the future like nanorobots, machines and transporters you need something to fuel it. So there is a great incentive to build motors at the nanoscale,"" said Ben Feringa, professor of organic chemistry at the University of Groningen, and one of the authors of the research. ""There are many nanosystems built from all kinds of materials, but this is, as far as we can tell, the first time a nanomotor has been used to propel something by fueling it."" The fuel in this instance came from a scanning tunnelling microscope (STP) with its atom-sized stylus acting as an electrode allowing electricity to flow from its tip to the surface beneath it, Feringa says. ""When there is a molecule, the current goes through it and electricity excites the motor which drives the car forward,"" Feringa said. The discovery, say scientists, takes them a step closer to understanding and ultimately mimicking nature's highly efficient molecular robots. ""In living cells there are a whole variety of molecule motors that are involved in almost every important biological process like cell division and transport, and mobility in our muscles,"" Feringa said. The world's smallest synthetic motor was created by Alex Zettl, professor of physics at University of California, Berkeley in 2003 while the first nano car (without a motor) was built by James Tour in 2005. ""The Feringa team is to be congratulated for their excellent work,"" said Tour, a professor of chemistry at Rice University, Texas. ""It will certainly propel the field to a higher level of sophistication with the eventual goal of synthetic molecular machines being used for controlled transport and ex vivo (in an artificial environment outside an organism) bottom-up assembly..."" he added. But it's still early days and Feringa says he feels a bit like the Wright Brothers, likening the nano car to their ""fairly awkward-looking primitive plane"" when compared to the passenger jets of today. ""It's very difficult to know where the future will go and ultimately the systems will be different. But first you have to find the fundamental principles. That makes things possible,"" he said. The research, which was completed in conjunction with scientists from the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa) is published in the journal Nature.","Dutch scientists create the smallest vehicle in the world .

"(CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder called the leaks about U.S. surveillance programs ""extremely damaging"" and vowed that the person responsible would be held accountable. Appearing at a U.S.-European Union ministerial meeting Friday in Dublin, Ireland, Holder was asked by a reporter why the United States hasn't requested the arrest of Edward Snowden, the self-avowed National Security Agency leaker. He is believed to be in Hong Kong, and authorities are trying to keep track of his whereabouts. Singapore Airlines has received an alert from the British Home Office urging it not to let Snowden board a flight to the United Kingdom, a representative for the airline in London said Friday. In his remarks, Holder didn't mention Snowden's name and said the case remains under investigation. Snowden provided documents to journalists revealing the existence of secret programs to collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and the Internet activity of overseas residents. ""The national security of the United States has been damaged as a result those leaks. The safety of the American people and the safety of people who reside in allied nations have been put at risk as a result of these leaks,"" Holder said. ""We are presently in the process of that investigation, and I'm confident the person who is responsible will be held accountable."" A glance at opinions about the NSA leaker . The leaks have spurred great concern in Europe. EU officials in Dublin raised questions, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel told CNN in an interview that European officials are particularly concerned about the PRISM program -- the secret set of tools used to collect data about overseas Internet communications. The NSA and FBI have obtained massive numbers of U.S. phone logs through a court order. Merkel intends to discuss the PRISM surveillance program with President Obama, she told CNN in Berlin on Friday. She wants the greatest possible transparency on all these issues, she said. The European Union has ""serious concerns"" about the reported large-scale surveillance of online data by U.S. authorities, European Commission Vice President Viviane Reding said. Holder discussed the leak about Verizon turning over details of phone calls. The Obama administration invoked the Patriot Act's Section 215 -- as well as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- as the basis for a secret court order demanding Verizon records that show originating and terminating phone numbers, their location, time and duration. That information, called telephony metadata, requires a court order. Holder explained that the surveillance programs are overseen by courts, strictly monitored and focused on wrongdoing such as terrorism. He said the program does not allow the government to listen in on anyone's phone calls and the information required doesn't include ""the content of any communication or the identity of any subscriber."" ""The court only allows that data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion based on specific facts that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization,"" he said. ""Only special cleared counter-terrorism personnel who are specifically trained in the court-approved procedures may even access those records. All information that is required under this order is subject to strict restrictions on handling and is overseen by the Department of Justice and the FISA court. And only a very small fraction of the records are ever reviewed because the vast majority of the data is not responsive to any terrorism-related query that might be posed,"" he said. Holder was referring to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. As for PRISM, he said the program ""facilitates the targeted acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning foreign targets located outside the United States under again court oversight."" He stressed that the program is subject to extensive ""internal and external"" oversight. ""The government cannot target anyone under the court-approved procedures for this program unless there is an appropriate and documented foreign intelligence purpose for the acquisition, such as for the prevention of terrorism, hostile cyber activities or nuclear proliferation,"" he said. ""The foreign target is reasonably believed to be outside the United States. We cannot target even foreign persons overseas without a valid foreign intelligence purpose."" Intercepted data called critical in terror investigations . Snowden went public about NSA surveillance programs Sunday in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian. As an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, a contractor for the U.S. electronic intelligence agency, he had been working at an NSA facility in Hawaii and had worked for the CIA in the past. He provided fresh fuel Wednesday for the controversy he has sparked, telling a Hong Kong newspaper that U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking networks around the world for years, including hundreds of computers in China. China quiet about Snowden . As for Snowden's whereabouts, the Singapore Airlines representative has not seen the alert and could not offer any other details. The British Home Office declined earlier to comment on reports that it was asking airlines not to let Snowden board flights to the UK. British Airways also declined to comment. China has remained tight-lipped about its stance on Snowden, who is believed to be holed up in a safe house somewhere in the semiautonomous territory of Hong Kong. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, he also said he planned to stay in Hong Kong to fight any attempt to force him to return to the United States because he has ""faith in Hong Kong's rule of law."" His comments come as the FBI is investigating his case. Chinese Internet users call on government to 'protect' Snowden . His presence in the southern Chinese territory, which has a separate system of government from the mainland, has raised questions about how an effort by the U.S. government to extradite him would unfold and what role Beijing might play in the process. ""We have no information to offer at the moment,"" a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, said in response to a question about Snowden at a regular news briefing in Beijing on Thursday. She repeated the same answer to several follow-up questions. There are ""no signs or indications"" that Snowden had accomplices or tried to sell secrets, a U.S. official said. Investigators think the leaker is still in Hong Kong and have a general sense of where he is in that Asian metropolis. Snowden's case has become a hot issue in that coastal city, making local newspaper front pages, stirring legal debates and prompting plans for a rally in support of him over the weekend. Progressive group fundraises for NSA leaker's legal defense . The reaction in mainland China, on the other hand, has been muted. State-run media outlets have covered the case cautiously, appearing to try to avoid focusing too much attention on some of the sensitive issues his disclosures have raised, such as government surveillance of citizens. The Snowden story has also so far failed to make big waves among China's tens of millions of highly active social media users. Some Chinese state media have taken the opportunity to highlight Snowden's comments to the South China Morning Post alleging that the U.S. government has hacked Chinese targets. In recent years, the Global Times newspaper said in an editorial, ""the United States has always claimed itself to be a victim of Chinese hacking activities. Many speculate that it's a coverup for hacking activities conducted by the U.S. government. Now, Snowden's revelation proves that such activities have already been going on for a long time."" Among some 61,000 reported targets of the National Security Agency, Snowden told the Hong Kong newspaper, are hundreds of computers in China. U.S. officials have increasingly accused China of being the source of thousands of attacks on U.S. military and commercial networks. Beijing has denied such attacks. The South China Morning Post said it had seen documents provided by Snowden but was unable to verify their authenticity. The newspaper also said it was unable to independently verify allegations of U.S. hacking of networks in Hong Kong and mainland China since 2009. Snowden told the paper that some of the targets included the Chinese University of Hong Kong, public officials and students. The documents also ""point to hacking activity by the NSA against mainland targets,"" it reported. The claims came just days after Obama pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to address cyberattacks emanating from China that Obama described as ""direct theft of United States property.""

"(CNN) -- A U.N. resolution justifies the targeting of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, a senior NATO military official with operational knowledge of the Libya mission told CNN Thursday. The resolution applies to Gadhafi because, as head of the military, he is part of the control and command structure and therefore a legitimate target, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to talk to the media. Asked by CNN whether Gadhafi was being targeted, the NATO official declined to give a direct answer. But NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu disputed the claim, saying the alliance was not specifically targeting Gadhafi. ""We are targeting critical military capabilities that could be used to attack civilians, including command and control centers that could be used to plan and organize such attacks,"" Lungescu said. ""We are simply not targeting individuals,"" she said, but noted on CNN's American Morning that those military capabilities are the ""nerve center of Gadhafi's kill chain. The war machine that has been consistently attacking, relentlessly attacking and systematically attacking civilians in Libya."" ""We've seen just the other day in Misrata that sort of indiscriminate shelling is still continuing. So the Gadhafi regime still poses a threat to its own people."" NATO has been ramping up pressure on the regime, employing helicopters last weekend for the first time against Gadhafi's forces. Explosions are heard often in Tripoli, evidence of allied air strikes. NATO intervened in March in the months-long civil war under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians as Gadhafi tried to crush the revolt against him. The resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council authorized ""all necessary measures,"" with the exception of a ground invasion, to protect civilians. NATO's goal is to end attacks against civilians, the withdrawal of Gadhafi forces to barracks and bases, and full humanitarian access, Lungescu said. ""There is, of course, a political track and that is what has been going on with the Contact Group in Abu Dhabi,"" she said, referring to the Thursday meeting of world powers focused on the Libyan crisis. The group bolstered financial and moral support for the Libyan opposition there and focused on sustaining pressure on Gadhafi. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Wednesday it is time to start planning for what to do in Libya after Gadhafi's departure ""because Gadhafi's reign of terror is coming to an end."" But Gadhafi has refused to step down, going so far this week as to do a live audio broadcast as NATO warplanes bombed his Tripoli compound. ""We will not surrender,"" he said during Tuesday's broadcast. NATO recently announced its decision to extend its mission in Libya by 90 days. CNN's Eve Bower contributed to this report.","NATO spokeswoman says the alliance is not specifically targeting Gadhafi .

"(CNN) -- Eight months after revealing her diagnosis with early-onset Alzheimer's, the head coach of the University of Tennessee's women's basketball team announced she was stepping down Wednesday. Pat Summitt, who led the Lady Vols to eight national championships and whose 1,098 wins are the most in major-college basketball history, will remain involved in mentoring players and recruiting as the team's head coach emeritus, the university said. ""I've loved being the head coach at Tennessee for 38 years, but I recognize that the time has come to move into the future and to step into a new role,"" Summitt said in a statement released by the university. Associate head coach Holly Warlick, an assistant on the team's staff for 27 seasons, has been named Summitt's successor, the university said. ""If anyone asks, you can find me observing practice or in my office,"" the 60-year-old Summitt said. ""Coaching is the great passion of my life, and the job to me has always been an opportunity to work with our student athletes and help them discover what they want. I will continue to make them my passion. I love our players and my fellow coaches, and that's not going to change."" Along with other university officials, Summitt is expected to speak to reporters at a news conference on Thursday. In August, she said that her prediagnosis symptoms included asking her son the same question repeatedly, but said she intended to keep coaching. Related: Alzheimer's and college basketball's winningest coach . As she headed into her 38th season with the team in November, she said she'd scaled back some of her workload, allowing assistant coaches to handle e-mails and other tasks. ""I wake up and I go and drink my coffee, and I do about 12 puzzles before I ever go into the office,"" Summitt said at the time. ""When I get there, my mind is sharp. And that's important -- very important."" Summitt, long revered for her success, was widely praised for continuing to work. SI.com's Kelli Anderson wrote that Summitt could add to her legacy by bringing attention to Alzheimer's in the way other sports figures have done -- Jim Valvano, Kay Yow and Lance Armstrong for cancer; Arthur Ashe and Magic Johnson for HIV/AIDS. After her announcement, the university's athletic department began selling bright orange ""We Back Pat"" T-shirts, giving the proceeds to Alzheimer's Tennessee and the University of Tennessee Medical Center. School officials, former players and longtime rivals alike praised Summitt on Wednesday. ""It is extremely difficult to adequately express what Pat Summitt has meant to the University of Tennessee, the sport of basketball and the growth of women's athletics nationally,"" University of Tennessee Athletic Director Dave Hart said. ""She is an icon who does not view herself in that light, and her legacy is well-defined and everlasting. Just like there will never be another (UCLA men's basketball coach) John Wooden, there will never be another Pat Summitt. I look forward to continuing to work with her in her new role. She is an inspiration to everyone."" Beth Bass, CEO of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association, noted that Summitt was a founding member of the group. ""When you think of women's basketball, you think of Pat Summitt. She is the first female coach whose name literally has become synonymous with her sport. ... All coaches of girls' and women's basketball have her to thank in large part for the success our game now enjoys,"" Bass said in a statement. Geno Auriemma, coach of the University of Connecticut's women's basketball team, said Summitt would ""continue to make significant impacts"" in her new role. ""Pat's vision for the game of women's basketball and her relentless drive pushed the game to a new level and made it possible for the rest of us to accomplish what we did,"" Auriemma said in a statement. Summitt was 22 years old when she became the team's head coach in 1974. Under her leadership, Tennessee has been the only school to appear in all 32 NCAA Women's Basketball Tournaments since the tournament's inception in 1982, the university said. The Lady Vols have earned a No. 1 seed in the tournament 21 times. During the 2011-2012 season, Sports Illustrated named Summitt as Sportswoman of the Year, and the NCAA gave her the NCAA President's Gerald R. Ford Award for her leadership in intercollegiate athletics. ""Her career is a powerful reminder that the job of the coach is not just to win games but to be a mentor and help develop the life skills of their players,"" U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in a statement Wednesday. ""Now, as she moves on to continue her courageous role as a spokesperson in the fight against Alzheimer's, I know she will continue to educate and teach so many of us once more.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Education reached a settlement with Yale University on Friday, acknowledging the school ""largely under-reported"" allegations of sexual harassment, but has since made changes to its policies to resolve accusations it allowed a ""sexually hostile environment"" on campus. Russlynn Ali, the department's assistant secretary for civil rights, said the school's process for reporting sexual harassment had been ""confusing to students"" and ""that records of their complaints and their outcomes were not adequately kept."" The federal investigation was spawned in 2011 by a 26-page complaint filed by 16 students following a controversial video released online that showed fraternity recruits yelling chants encouraging rape as they marched through campus. The complaint also followed reports of a party in which undergraduate students were allegedly asked to strip naked. Yale students were ""not made aware of the resources available to victims of sexual harassment and violence,"" said Ali, whose investigation ""revealed allegations of sexual harassment beyond what was included in the (2011) complaint."" Over a four-year period, there were 13 documented cases of sexual harassment, an illustration of the underreporting that went on at the school. Under the agreement, the university will not face disciplinary action with the understanding that it keeps in place policy changes instituted after the complaint was filed. The school must report on its progress to the Office of Civil Rights until May 2014. Yale announces new steps amid federal sexual harassment probe . Yale has agreed to address the ""immediate concerns and put systems in place to help prevent future Title IX discrimination,"" Ali said, referring to the federal gender-equity law. The university ""fully cooperated"" with the investigation and didn't wait until its completion to initiate policy changes, she added. Those measures include increased training and staff dedicated to responding to and preventing sexual harassment and violence. The university said in a statement Friday that it was ""pleased ... with the terms of our voluntary agreement."" ""Yale has sought to engage the entire community to combat sexual misconduct in a transparent, consistent, and comprehensive manner,"" the statement said. ""Prior to the filing of the Title IX complaint, the university had begun implementing its University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct ... to address complaints of sexual misconduct."" The New Haven, Connecticut-based school is not the only university recently investigated by the federal government over its policies regarding sexual harassment and violence. Last year, the Department of Education reached a similar settlement with Notre Dame University after investigating ""student-on-student sexual harassment"" which included sexual violence. A student at nearby St. Mary's College ""committed suicide after reporting that she was sexually assaulted by another student,"" according to the department's release. Between 2008 and 2011, the department's Office for Civil Rights reported a 78% increase in sexual harassment complaints.

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican leaders will propose cutting more spending to balance the amount of additional disaster relief money in a short-term government spending measure defeated earlier by the House, two Republican sources told CNN on Thursday. The additional spending cut, called an offset, would be roughly $100 million from a Department of Energy loan program linked to the solar panel firm Solyndra, which recently collapsed, said the sources -- a GOP aide and a Republican member of Congress -- who spoke on condition of not being identified. The plan, which faces sharp Democratic opposition, could pave the way for a partial government shutdown when the current fiscal year ends on September 30 if it is not resolved. Debate on the measure began late Thursday  night, with a vote set for that night or early on Friday morning. The Democratic-controlled Senate won't take action until at least Friday, having already adjourned for the day. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blasted it as ""not an honest effort at compromise,"" criticizing its Republicans supporters of moving ""even further towards the tea party (and insisting) on holding out on Americans who have suffered devastating losses."" ""It fails to provide the relief that our fellow Americans need as they struggle to rebuild their lives in the wake of floods, wildfires and hurricanes, and it will be rejected by the Senate,"" said the Nevada Democrat, warning the Federal Emergency Management Agency could ""run out of money as soon as Monday."" The move was intended to persuade the 48 Republicans who voted against the GOP measure Wednesday night to change their minds, according to the GOP aide. Language in a proposed amendment to the Senate bill, for instance, would rescind ""the unobligated balances remaining"" for the energy loan program. Democrats in the House and Senate said Thursday they oppose any offsets to counter the emergency spending for natural disasters, and the Republican strategy sets up a another budget showdown in Congress -- this time over the short-term spending measure that would fund the government for the first seven weeks of the new fiscal year, which begins October 1. On Thursday night, senior Senate Democratic leadership aide said the party's caucus is united against Republican-tailored versions of the measure. ""We are looking for a real attempt to compromise, not just an attempt to appease their own people,"" the aide said. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, earlier insisted to reporters that an agreement would be reached and the spending measure passed to prevent a possible partial government shutdown. ""There is no threat of a government shutdown. Let's just get this out there,"" Boehner said. In addition to the disagreement over offsets, the Democratic-controlled Senate differs with the House on how much emergency money the measure would provide for disaster relief in the wake of Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee, wildfires and tornadoes this year. Failure by Congress to pass the measure would mean a partial government shutdown at midnight next Friday. However, the political fallout of such an impasse with a public already angered by congressional stalemate as an election year approaches makes a shutdown unlikely. ""What we've been trying to avoid are these constant scrums we have over government functioning the way it should,"" Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters earlier Thursday. Speaking before news of the additional offset provision added by House Republicans, Reid proclaimed himself ""cautiously optimistic"" an agreement would be reached. With Congress scheduled to begin a week-long recess on Friday that would run through the end of the fiscal year, leaders began considering the possible necessity of delaying the break to complete work on the short-term spending measure. Reid said the Senate is ""ready to stay in Washington next week."" And in a message to House members, Cantor's office said ""members are advised that a weekend session is now possible."" Asked about the possibility of a weekend session, Boehner said Thursday: ""I surely hope not."" The House vote Wednesday was 195 ""yea"" and 230 ""nay,"" with 48 Republicans joining all but a handful of minority Democrats in opposing the short-term spending plan. Most of Republicans who voted ""no"" were conservatives who believed the overall spending level in the measure is too high. The failed vote was a second rebuke of Boehner and the House Republican leadership by members elected to Congress last year with the support of the conservative tea party movement to give the GOP majority control. During the debt ceiling debate in July, Boehner had to withdraw his own plan for deficit reduction at one point when it became clear he lacked sufficient support within his caucus to get it passed. This time, the speaker threatened members with pulling them from committee assignments if they failed to support the continuing resolution on Wednesday, according to a Republican source who attended the GOP conference meeting. The source, speaking on condition of not being identified, said Boehner ""cracked the whip"" at the Wednesday morning meeting and told Republicans bluntly they needed to back the measure or he'd go to the steering committee and start pulling committee assignments for members who didn't vote for it. The Republican steering committee approves member committee assignments. On Thursday, Boehner shrugged off the defeat as the price of trying to get legislation through the democratic process. ""I have no fear in allowing the House to work its will,"" he said, adding: ""Does it make my life a little more difficult? Yes it does."" Rep. Bill Huizenga of Michigan, a conservative freshman Republican who opposed the resolution, said removing the offset provision -- as Democrats want -- would be ""more problematic for me and probably for more of the caucus."" Asked if he was concerned about Boehner's threat to take away committee posts, Huizenga said: ""It's far less of a concern than going back home and not being able to explain my vote."" The Republican-based amendments relate to a federal loan program meant to promote alternate energy and also boost the economy. It is the same program that funded Solyndra, which declared bankruptcy late last month despite receiving a $535 million federal guarantee in 2009. The energy department is facing a September 30 deadline to give 14 companies final approval for loan guarantees totaling more than $9 billion. The continuing resolution, which would fund government agencies through November 18, would allocate fewer resources to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers for disaster response than approved by the Senate last week. Additional funds are needed because the string of disasters this year has depleted the FEMA and Army Corps of Engineers coffers supporting recovery and rebuilding efforts. The House measure included a total of $3.6 billion in disaster relief money -- $1 billion in emergency funds available when the bill is enacted and another $2.6 billion to be budgeted for those federal response agencies for the 2012 fiscal year that begins October 1. In addition, House Republican leaders insist that the $1 billion in immediate disaster funding be offset with $1.5 billion in cuts to a loan program that helps automakers retool their operations to make more fuel-efficient cars. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama asked Congress for a total of $5.1 billion in additional disaster aid, $500 million of which was for immediate relief. Last week, the Senate passed a measure with bipartisan support that would provide $6.9 billion for FEMA and other federal agencies, to be used both for immediate disaster relief as well as in the new fiscal year. The Senate version required no spending offsets. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said his party would support the House measure if the offset provision were removed, as did Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. On the Senate side, Reid indicated possible acceptance of the House proposal minus the offset, known as ""pay-for"" in legislative parlance. Asked if the amount of disaster funding in the House version is sufficient, Reid said: ""The answer is no, it's not sufficient, but if they get rid of pay-for, we'll take a look at that."" During floor debate on the measure, Hoyer and other Democrats complained that any kind of offset would be unprecedented for emergency funding to help Americans in need. ""Even if they had the best offset in the world, I still think it's wrong"" to require equivalent spending cuts when getting money to disaster victims, said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. Conservative Republicans argued that the nation's expanding deficits require as much spending restraint as possible. ""We're trying to effect change in a way that we spend taxpayer dollars. That's what this whole thing is about,"" Cantor, R-Virginia, said Wednesday night. ""No one is denying anyone disaster aid if they need it, and we're trying to be responsible and to do the right thing."" However, the inability of Cantor and the rest of the Republican leadership to push through the resolution showed the unstable politics at play. Democrats were nearly united in opposing the plan, meaning the Republicans couldn't afford the 48 defections from their ranks. For Boehner, voting against the Republican resolution amounted, in essence, to ""voting to spend more money"" in the end, he said Thursday. To Hoyer, the defeat of the GOP measure in the House ""says that we are continuing to struggle to do things in a bipartisan fashion."" If House Republicans ""expect our votes, they have to work with us,"" he said. ""They can't just give us something and say ... their way or the highway."" ""They've shown that they can't govern,"" Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, said of the House Republicans. ""We could work this out with them in the spirit of bipartisanship, but they cannot work it out with themselves.""

"(CNN) -- She has become a symbol of the violent protests in Turkey. Across social media, she's known as ""The Woman in Red."" Wearing a red summer dress and a delicate necklace, the woman walked among demonstrators in Istanbul's Taksim Square when a security officer lurched at her and pepper-sprayed her so powerfully her hair was blown upward. She could do nothing but turn away from the toxic spray. The officer, wearing a gas mask, lunged closer to her, unleashing more spray on the back of her neck. She covered her mouth as officers spray others. The photos of the incident have been shared widely on social media in recent days. International headlines have proclaimed her an ""icon"" of the movement against the government of Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan. ""That photo encapsulates the essence of this protest,"" a math student named Esra told Reuters. ""The violence of the police against peaceful protesters, people just trying to protect themselves and what they value."" The images have also inspired cartoons and graffiti in Turkey and around the world. And just seeing a woman in a red dress walking in public has apparently touched a chord with other women in the region, too. Zeinobia tweeted, ""The woman in red in Turkey, I wish to wear such dress in downtown Cairo without fear, without protests, without sexual harassment."" But the truth is that woman in red told CNN Wednesday that she wants no part of this. What's happening in Turkey is the ""people's revolt,"" she said. Ceyda Sungur told Turkey's TV 24 that she is uncomfortable about her new fame. She doesn't want to be an icon of a movement. ""There are a lot of people who were at the park and they were also tear-gassed,"" she said. ""There is not (a) difference between them and I."" But, she added, ""I am not surprised"" about the violence that evolved from what began days ago as a peaceful sit-in to protest plans to demolish a park in central Istanbul -- the last green space in the city center. Some in the crowd chanted ""Tayyip resign!"" ""Shoulder to shoulder against fascism!"" they shouted. Riot police moved in, lobbing tear gas and using pepper spray. Protesters responded by hurling bottles, blocking bulldozers and setting up barricades. Eventually, protesters and police were locked in full-on clashes. Erdogan conceded Saturday that Turkish security forces had used tear gas excessively against demonstrators. On Tuesday, a top Turkish official apologized for the ""police aggression"" and trade unions threw their weight behind the demonstrations. The 240,000-member KESK confederation of public-sector workers called for a two-day strike to protest what it calls the ""fascism"" of Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party. Riot police around Ankara's central Kizilay Square brought in armored vehicles topped with water cannon in a show of force Tuesday evening, but the demonstrations throughout Wednesday were mostly calm.

In 2012, a Gallup poll showed that 59% of American adults said gay and lesbian relationships are morally acceptable, up 19 percentage points since 2001. Polls show that a majority in the country support same-sex marriage. The gay marriage question has even reached halls of the Supreme Court which, today, struck down a key provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, and California's Propostion 8, a voter-approved ballot that banned same-sex marriage. There has been much written in the press about how gays have gone from a reviled minority to accepted in just a matter of decades. But it is important to remember that this is not some magical shift that happened because we watched lovable gay characters on ""Will and Grace"" and ""Modern Family."" It is due in part to real people led by youth, who came out of the shadows to work to change attitudes within their own communities, neighborhoods, workplaces and places of worship. Over the past three years, I've filmed The New Black, which examines how the black community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the marriage movement and the fight over civil rights. The film is centered in Maryland, which has a significant black voting bloc, during the 2012 election. It documents the activists working to build support for a referendum supporting marriage equality. It features young people like Karess Taylor-Hughes, who spent the past three years working to build support for marriage equality in black churches and communities. I followed her in the streets of Baltimore and the leafy suburbs of Prince George's County as she engaged with people from all walks of life about how the push for gay equality was an expansion of civil rights. She questioned how black people, given their struggle to be granted freedoms, could be against granting rights to someone else. What I saw in Maryland was that the activists who were working for marriage equality were untangling the layers of the issue, and they were engaging African-Americans in a way that had not happened before. And it was youth -- the ""New Black"" in the film -- who pushed their parents, their teachers and some of their clergy to understand gay rights as an expansion of civil rights. These conversations helped lead to a very different outcome in Maryland in 2012 than in California in 2008: For the first time, the public voted for marriage equality. These discussions were happening in different homes around America. Even President Barack Obama cited his daughters, Malia and Sasha, in his evolution from supporting civil unions to supporting same-sex marriage. It feels like their efforts have now allowed this new understanding about who gets civil rights, and also the perception of gay Americans. And even as there are still more battles to fight -- to stop hate crimes, allow for adoption laws and end workplace discrimination -- it is significant that the gay community is seen less as a deviant group asking for special rights and more as humans entitled to civil rights, fairness and equality to all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yoruba Richen.","Yoruba Richen: Attitude toward same-sex marriage and the gay community has evolved .

"(CNN) -- Politics will mix with partying this Pride season as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies around the world celebrate President Barack Obama's support for same-sex marriage and protest North Carolina's passage of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex unions. When planning a Pride vacation, pick a destination where the scale of the celebration is one that you can handle, recommends Ed Salvato, gay travel expert and editor in chief of Man About World, a soon-to-launch gay travel magazine for the iPad. Instead of the biggies such as San Francisco or New York City, which might be overwhelming, consider choosing ""a nice, manageable Pride in an interesting location."" Book early, as hotels fill quickly, and be sure to ask about Pride packages, says Salvato. ""Often hotels will throw in something so your party starts as soon as you get into your room."" All are welcome to join in on the fun. For more tips on enjoying the best Pride fests worldwide, check out our guide: . Boston: June 1- 10 . What Salvato loves about Boston Pride is the diversity of people from all walks of life who come out for the celebration. This time of year, he says, ""shows Boston in its greatest light."" One highlight of Boston Pride is dancing in the streets. On Saturday, June 9, a Women's Block Party begins at 1 Boylston Place just after the parade. On Sunday afternoon, block partiers can pick between shaking their groove thing at the Back Bay Edition on St. James Avenue in Boston, or the JP Edition on Perkins Street in Jamaica Plain, which features a Dogs & Drag Fashion Show, family-friendly activities and five female DJs. Other options include themed Pride @ Night parties that take place all weekend long, including a Youth Dance, which kicks off at 7 p.m. on Saturday. But Boston Pride is more than just one big party. This year, cultural events include a human rights and education discussion as well as a free exhibit at the Boston Center for Adult Education called ""Pride: 40 Years of Protest & Celebration,"" which chronicles the early history of LGBT advocacy in New England. Early arrivals to the city can call Old Boston Tours to book the ""Old Boston Original Secret Tour"" and learn more about the extraordinary lives of the men and women who made Boston great. The $30 tour is 90 minutes, and reservations are required. Visitors will not want to miss the new American wing at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, which includes a stunning Tiffany favrile glass window, ""Parakeets and Gold Fish Bowl."" Tel Aviv, Israel: June 3 - 8 . During the city's annual Pride celebration, Tel Aviv lives up to its reputation as the gay capital of the Middle East. (Even the crosswalks are painted in rainbow stripes.) All week long, clubs and bars are packed, and special events are planned, including two concerts by Grammy- and BRIT Award-nominee Rufus Wainwright. On Friday, June 8, revelers hit the streets for the parade that has become one of Tel Aviv's biggest events of the year. Kicking off in Gan Meir garden, a small park in the heart of the city's gay community, the parade ends with a massive beach party on the Mediterranean Sea. From 2 p.m. until evening, Gordon Beach is mobbed with people moving to the sounds of the city's hottest DJs. For more beach fun, visit Hilton Beach, a popular spot among gay men. Then, for a change of scenery, check out the Azrieli Observatory for a chance to view ""the white city"" from the highest point possible. Or plan an afternoon at Beit Ha'ir, a museum of Tel Aviv history housed in Town Hall. Amsterdam, Netherlands: July 28 - August 5 . What better year to visit Amsterdam than this one? This year marks the 25th anniversary of the world's first gay monument, the Homomonument, located on the Westermarkt in the center of the city. Visitors can pay their respects, then stop by Pink Point, an information kiosk/shop providing an array of gay guides and souvenirs. Just around the corner is another opportunity to contemplate the meaning of freedom: the Anne Frank House, where the world-famous diary was penned while Frank hid in a secret annex. Next, top off the afternoon with a cold one (or three) at some of Amsterdam's microbreweries. Check the city's official website for a list of places to enjoy ""rich tripels and fruity white beers"" as well as ""dark brown bocks and thirst-quenching pilsners."" By nightfall, the gay districts on Reguliersdwarsstraat and Amstel will be hopping with street and club-circuit parties that rage all weekend long. The highlight of Amsterdam Pride is the famous Canal Parade on Saturday, August 4. Unlike in most parades, Amsterdam's floats actually float. This year, organizers expect half a million spectators will watch 75 decorated boats sail from 2 to 6 p.m. through the Prinsengracht Canal and Amstel River. Find a full listing of the more than 300 parties and cultural events on the official calendar. Asheville, North Carolina: October 6 . Known for its progressive politics and vibrant arts and culture scene, Asheville has been dubbed one of the ""gayest cities in America"" and one of the ""top five surprisingly gay small towns"" by The Advocate. The city's annual Blue Ridge Pride festival typically draws between 8,000 and 12,000 people from throughout the Southeast to Pack Square for a full day of music, workshops and family activities, as well as a showcase of gay-friendly businesses, service organizations and community groups. Pride festival chairperson Holly Parr says she's proud of how quickly Blue Ridge Pride, organized by an all-volunteer nonprofit, has grown since it was founded in 2009. ""We're excited about what we are able to do for our greater Western North Carolina LGBTQ community,"" she says. The grassroots, hometown feel of Blue Ridge Pride makes this a special destination to consider. This is especially poignant given the recent amendment passed in North Carolina that defines marriage as the union of one man and one woman, says Salvato. ""It's a good time to show our support and solidarity in a state that's had a setback,"" he explains. And with its sophisticated spas, shops, restaurants and more than 30 art galleries, as well as golf clubs and other outdoor activities in the Blue Ridge and Great Smoky mountains, Asheville offers plenty to do both before and after Pride. Atlanta: October 13 - 14 . Some call Atlanta the ""GayTL,"" and the city offers something for everyone in the LGBT community. The largest pride event in the Southeast includes not only the main festival, but a Dyke March, a Trans March, and from August 29 to September 3, Black Gay Pride, sponsored by In the Life Atlanta. With a distinctive Southern flavor, the Atlanta Pride Festival in Piedmont Park entices people from all across the region. Some attendees from nearby towns revel in their once-a-year opportunity to step out of the closet. Pride festivities kick off well before the official weekend, with pre-Pride events such as an AIDS vigil, an exhibit of 25 years of international AIDS posters, a commitment ceremony and a men's designer event. And once the main weekend rolls around, visitors can take their pick from children's entertainers, a car and motorcycle show, a literary showcase, human rights exhibits, a community health expo, and a marketplace featuring more than 200 vendor booths. At 1 p.m. on Sunday, October 14, the parade kicks off down the streets of Midtown, drawing tens of thousands of spectators. And if all those options aren't enough, step out of the Pride fray to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change to learn about King's life, legacy and teachings. Or visit Zoo Atlanta, in Grant Park, home to endangered animals such as rhinos, orangutans, gorillas and elephants.","Boston visitors can take to the streets for various dance parties .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Like pretty much every gay American with an Internet connection, I'd gotten sick of staring at Tweetdeck and SCOTUSblog all month, waiting for the day the Supreme Court would rule on same-sex marriage. ""COME ON, SCOTUS. I GOT ESSAYS TO WRITE, MEN TO MARRY, HAVOC TO WREAK,"" one Twitter user, @theferocity, wrote Monday. Amen, brother. So on Wednesday morning, with the court sure to issue opinions on cases involving Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban, and the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, the federal law prohibiting married same-sex couples from collecting federal marriage benefits, I decided to find real-life people -- off the Internet -- to share the potentially historic moment. After making a few calls, I arranged to meet a group of five homeless LGBT young people at a coffee shop in Atlanta's gayborhood. I was hoping the court would send them a positive, affirming message -- that they matter, that they exist, and that they're fully equal under the law. And I wondered what they thought about the national debate. The news that the court struck down DOMA and balked on Prop 8 led teary-eyed crowds to cheer, hug and hold rainbow-colored flags in other parts of the country. But the news rang hollow here. Opinion: For gays, profess stunning, fast . ""It doesn't really matter. It doesn't affect anything,"" Rob Pittman, 23, said of the court's decisions. Pittman left home at 12, he said, because his parents didn't accept the fact that he's gay. ""Regardless, people are still going to hate us."" ""When same-sex marriage becomes legal, and we're able to get married, there's going to be a lot more people (coming) out of the closet, which means there's going to be a lot more hate crimes. That's how I look at it,"" said Kaylee Campbell, 20. Rick Westbrook, the 50-year-old who manages the six-bedroom Atlanta shelter named Lost-n-Found Youth, read updates from SCOTUSblog (it's short for Supreme Court of the United States, for the uninitiated) from his iPhone. ""DOMA is unconstitutional ...,"" he told the group. Hooray, right? Layla Wright, 24, initially was the only person who clapped. ""Come on, clap!"" she implored. Most didn't. Instead, they left to go on a smoke break. Maybe such indifference comes off as smug or ungrateful at a time when many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people -- and our supporters -- are celebrating. But it shouldn't -- not if you take a hard look at what it's like to be an openly LGBT young person in many parts of the country. According to one survey, 40% of homeless kids are LGBT. That's no coincidence. They live in societies and in families that discriminate against them. Opinion: How youth led change in public attitudes . That's true whether or not DOMA exists. Most states don't sanction same-sex marriage (can we start calling it simply ""marriage,"" by the way?). Most allow people to be fired for being gay -- legally. This is a fight that's far from over. ""Today's DOMA ruling is a historic step forward for #MarriageEquality. #LoveIsLove,"" the @BarackObama Twitter feed posted. It is a huge step forward. And that should be recognized and lauded. I'm thrilled for same-sex couples in California who likely will be able to marry in coming weeks because of the court's opinion. But I feel for the couples in many other states who still can't -- and for kids like those who live at Lost-n-Found in Atlanta, who have grown up being taught they are less than human. Watch all the ""Glee"" you want. That's still the reality. Campbell, a young woman with a bright smile and a red-sequined shirt, told me her parents kicked her out of her home at 15 because she's a lesbian. ""It wasn't good,"" she said. ""They're really, really, really religious. Very religious."" That was in Alabama. She lived with friends or slept behind dumpsters before moving to Maine to try living with her grandmother, who also rejected her. She landed at the homeless shelter in Atlanta a year and a half ago. When people have treated her so poorly -- simply because of who she is -- how could you blame her for being less than enthusiastic about the state of gay America? Wright, a transgender woman, the one who clapped when DOMA fell, took a sunnier point of view. ""It's not going to end the fight,"" she said. ""They expect people to lie down and take this and give up? Uh-uh, honey! You've got another thing coming!"" What's next for gay rights movement? I could tell Westbrook, the shelter leader, was thrilled to hear this. Which was how I felt, too. Westbrook has been with his partner for 19 years. DOMA and Prop 8 matter to him very personally. And when he was the age of these young people, he said he never could have imagined a national conversation about same-sex marriage -- much less it being legal for some. ""It's one step in the right direction,"" he said. ""It'll happen."" But when? That's my question. And it's one that does matter. Legalizing marriage across the country not only would have immediate benefits for same-sex couples and their children -- but it also would help change the society these young people inhabit. Slowly, it would make the world safer for them. Their speaking up will help, too, of course. As the conversation wound down, Wright proudly announced her latest Facebook status update. ""Illegalizing love should be illegal,"" she said, reading from her phone. She quoted Wanda Sykes and then wrote, ""Haters need to get over their cheap selves now."" ""Ten exclamation points!"" she said. Let's hope plenty of state legislators follow her on Facebook. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","The U.S. Supreme Court rules on two same-sex marriage cases .

"(CNN) -- There's good and bad news regarding Robert Crais' new novel, ""Suspect."" First, the bad: There's no sign of uber-popular, crime-fighting duo, Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. Now the good: There is a dog. Hear me out. Scuttling his most popular characters is a risky move for the award-winning Crais. After all, 15 of his 18 previous novels featured fan favorites Elvis and Joe, including ""Taken,"" his most recent, which hit No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list. Before fervent fans complain, consider that the star of ""Suspect"" isn't just any animal. Crais has created a unique, endearing canine crime fighter that steals every scene she's in. Here's the setup. Los Angeles cop Scott James barely survives a high-powered shootout with a mysterious criminal gang. His partner is killed. Scott is left broken, both physically and mentally. Worse, he blames himself for his partner's death. Now unfit for duty as a patrol officer, he moves to the Los Angeles Police Department canine unit, where he is paired with a German shepherd named Maggie. Like Scott, Maggie is on the mend. She served three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, using her powerful sense of smell to sniff out explosives, before losing her handler to a bomb blast. Both man and dog are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Together this pair of wounded warriors must help heal each other, while searching for clues in a last-chance case that could be their salvation or their untimely end. Like all of Crais' work, ""Suspect"" is an intense, fast-paced and thrilling page turner. He's winning raves from critics and has even made a fan out of the editor at Dog Fancy magazine, Ernie Slone, who says, ""The power of the human-animal bond, and the amazing ways that dogs comprehend our world, have never been better portrayed."" CNN recently spoke to the author from his Los Angeles home about his latest book as well as old dogs and new tricks. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What was the spark behind your new novel? Robert Crais: I had a big Akita, Yoshi, who was fabulous. I loved him. We lost him when he was 12, and I've never been able to replace him. Normally, most people lose a pet and get another and keep going on. But it just felt wrong to me; it felt disloyal. That was 15 years ago. I've been thinking more and more about him recently. That connection caused me to start doing research into the whole human-dog relationship. Through that I became aware of and interested in military-working dogs. I learned about the super-intimate connection between these dogs and their canine handlers. In many cases, when they're deployed, the handler and dog literally spend 24 hours a day together. They eat together and sleep together because of the nature of their job. It's a bond unlike any other human-canine bond. I encountered stories where a handler would be injured or killed, and the dog would be so protective and defensive of the handler, even though the person might be dead or seriously wounded, that the dog wouldn't even let our guys who were trying to help approach, because the dog and handler are a pack. I started reading every book that was available on how dogs think, how they perceive the world, the nature of the relationship between man and dog. It was a world that simply swallowed me because I found it so fascinating and interesting. CNN: You also spent time with police dogs? Crais: From military-working dogs, I got involved and educated in police canine units, which are different but in many ways the same thing because the human handler and the dog are partners. I went out with the LAPD canine units. The dogs are amazing and to talk with these guys, to see them work with their dogs really informed the book. It was a whole new world for me. Everyone knows dogs. Most people love dogs. I think most American families probably have a dog, but I don't think people really realize or understand just how wonderful and special dogs are. The more I learned about the co-dependency between man and dog and how deep that relationship can be, not in an anthropomorphized way but in a genuine and real way. I found it so beautiful, so moving and special that I just had to write about it. Scenes were just popping out of my head. With this particular book it was probably the most emotional that I've written out of my 19 novels. It was a book that I absolutely attacked because I felt so passionate about the subject matter. CNN: Part of ""Suspect"" is told through Maggie's eyes. Was it difficult to write from a dog's point of view? Crais: Actually, no. I guess I should say yes, but surprisingly it wasn't. I had read so many different books and articles on how dogs perceive the world -- their sense of smell, how dogs think, why dogs do what they do -- that when I finally was writing from Maggie's point of view it came very naturally. It was easy for me to imagine how in fact a dog does perceive what's going on around her. I found it a very, very natural thing to write. I fell in love with Maggie. I tried to make her as real as possible. Maggie isn't a cartoon dog. She doesn't think the way we think. I wanted her to represent for real how dogs perceive us and the world around them. CNN: In ""Suspect,"" Scott and Maggie both suffer from PTSD, but I didn't know that affected dogs? Crais: When I was doing the research, I learned about military-working dogs suffering from canine PTSD. Until that point, I wasn't aware that military dogs or police canines or any animal can suffer from PTSD, just like any person. Quite a few of the dogs that come back from Afghanistan or Iraq or police dogs that are involved in violent confrontations where there's gunfire can in fact exhibit the symptoms and suffer from PTSD. At Lackland Air Force Base, they make an effort to retrain military dogs that suffer from PTSD. It's a lengthy, long process. The treatment is much the same as it would be for people, but it's a difficult road back. It seemed to me that a dog like Maggie would certainly suffer from PTSD and ditto her handler Scott. These two characters, they needed each other. She can help him heal; he can help her heal. I really wanted to explore what they're going through together. CNN: So after this are you ready for another dog? Crais: In a wonderful way I think the immersion that I went through with this book has been very healing. It's much easier for me now to imagine sharing my life with another dog. Maybe another Yoshi, maybe a German shepherd, but I can see that happening again now. All I have to do is convince my wife. CNN: What's next? Will Elvis Cole and Joe Pike return in your next book? Crais: I think the next project is going to be an Elvis and Joe book. I will probably bring back Jon Stone, too. I can't say these things definitively because I have this horrible habit of falling in love with my characters, and even though ""Suspect"" was written as a standalone book, I keep wondering if I can come up with a story where Scott and Maggie somehow have to get involved with Elvis and Joe. If I can bring their two worlds together, that might be fun for me to write and fun for my fans to read. I just have to come up with the right story.

"London (CNN) -- As three members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot appeared in a Moscow court charged with hooliganism, the Twittersphere lit up with pictures and messages of support from around the world. Pussy Riot band members, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, Maria Alyokhina, 24, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 29, were sentenced to two years in prison after performing a song criticizing President Vladimir Putin inside Moscow's Christ Savior Cathedral in February. ""Mother Mary please drive Putin away,"" the band had screamed during the offending gig, their faces covered in the neon masks which have now become synonymous with their campaign. Famous friends . Celebrity supporters including Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, actress and model Bianca Jagger and Robert Smith of The Cure, tweeted their disgust with the charges, calling for greater freedom of speech in the country. ""I hope you can stay strong and believe that I, and many others like me who believe in free speech will do everything in our power to support you and the idea of artistic freedom,"" Paul McCartney posted on Twitter. Actress Mischa Barton tweeted: ""I can't believe sentencing #pussyriot to2 yrs in jail.as someone who lived in Moscow and has filmed& seen inside the jails my heart goes out."" While the young women awaited their fate in Moscow, balaclava-clad campaigners gathered outside Russian embassies across Europe and the U.S., sharing their photos across social media. ""#PussyRiot supporters outside London embassy shout 'Shame' and 'Putin scum' as they hear of guilty verdict,"" Moscow news channel RT London Bureau tweeted. Amnesty UK urged its Twitter followers to join the demonstrations, posting: ""2 years in jail. #PussyRiot sentence is a bitter blow for freedom of expression in Russia."" Outside the court in Moscow however, not everyone was backing the Pussy Riot cause, with civil activist Oleg Kozlovsky tweeting: ""Some anti- #PussyRiot demonstrators were heard chanting ""Burn the witches!""

"(CNN) -- Crime fiction fans know the name Parker, a single-named anti-hero of the 1960s. As a character, he's a career criminal, hired gun and professional thief, a pulp-fiction prince of America's seedy underworld. He's relentless and menacing with steely good looks. Imagine a hard-boiled Don Draper with a gun. Parker made his debut in 1962 in Richard Stark's ""The Hunter."" But Stark was a pseudonym of legendary author Donald Westlake, who continued writing about Parker's criminal exploits in more than two dozen books until his death in 2008. The character has long enjoyed cult classic status and found varying success on the big screen, portrayed by actors including Lee Marvin and Mel Gibson. More recently, Parker has found new life in a series of imaginative and stylish graphic novels from Eisner Award-winning artist and writer Darwyn Cooke. Comic fans recognize Cooke from his past success in the superhero genre, putting his own creative spin on icons like Batman, Catwoman, The Spirit and Watchmen. In re-imagining Parker -- starting with ""The Hunter"" in 2009, followed by ""The Outfit"" and now ""The Score"" -- Cooke has stayed incredibly faithful to Westlake's original novels. He describes his adaptations as being like noir movies on paper. In ""The Score,"" Cooke works in a lean palette of black, white and gold. His bold pen strokes, moody washes of color, and lean prose help the action pop off the page. Once again, Parker has become a hit critically and financially. Cooke is already working on a fourth graphic novel, with a fifth planned. CNN caught up with the artist and author as he prepared to debut ""The Score"" for fans at Comic-Con in San Diego. We spoke to him at his home in Nova Scotia by phone. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What drew you to Parker originally? Darwyn Cooke: I've always been a big fan of crime fiction. When I was young I started reading a lot of the classics like Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett, Cornell Woolrich -- I could go on and on. At that time the Parker novels were out of print, but I happened to see the Lee Marvin film ""Point Blank,"" which is one of my favorite movies, and realized later that it came from the Parker books. So I started haunting secondhand book shops and picking up the Parker novels and just completely fell in love with them. I thought they were the perfect crime novels, at least for me. So it's been kind of a 30-year love affair with the books. CNN: Describe how you put ""The Score"" together. Cooke: The first thing I do is create a working script out of a copy of the novel. I read ""The Score"" six or seven times, and as I'm passing through it, I'm making notes, highlighting scenes, maybe breaking a chapter down, writing down a visual cue, cutting out things that are extraneous. Then I sit down and start laying it out visually. I'm able to follow the novel very much like a script. I never type a script for Parker. I end up handwriting in pencil onto the art board right out of the novel. At that point, I start combing over it again. I'll start playing with scenes, maybe if I shuffle the order I get a more unexpected result. The process leading up to me sitting down at the art board can be as long as a year. Then I sit down at the table and it's about a four-month process. When I work on Parker, that's all I do. I just immerse myself in it. CNN: How did you adapt your style for the Parker novels? Cooke: I felt there was a certain fit there. I definitely did go out of my way to make what I was doing to complement the material. When Donald Westlake wrote the books, he did so under a pen name, Richard Stark. The name really describes the approach and the style of prose. So I took that as my cue. I tried to strip out a lot of things you would see in my more mainstream work, a lot of the details, the line work; I tried to break it down more into shapes and blocks of color. I didn't want to do black and white, but I knew full color was very expensive and wouldn't have been appropriate. I thought a one color approach was the perfect way to go. It allows you to get that black and white, film noir feeling from the images, but you have enough color there to give them some depth, sparkle and life that it wouldn't have otherwise. I really try to create it in the spirit it was written. CNN: This is your third Parker adaptation. Have you changed your approach over the series? Cooke: I'm trying to stay open to different ways to tell the story but remain incredibly faithful to the novels while I do it. There is some room for visual interpretation, but it's a balancing act. In ""The Score"" one of the main characters is Parker's pal, Grofield. In the novel, Donald describes him as an actor who always hears music in his head. Grofield hears background music to whatever it is he's doing, he's always dramatizing what he's doing. I picked up on that and all the scenes with Grofield start out like movie scenes featuring the kind of music he's hearing in his head as they go about this crime. Someone else will speak and the bubble pops and then we're into the reality of the situation. It's a great cue every time that Grofield comes on stage in the book. When we see the musical notes, the reader knows, OK, we're in Grofield's head now. It's something you can carry forward. CNN: What was it like to work with author Donald Westlake? Cooke: We had a pleasant communication together through e-mail. He was really generous with his time with me. In order for the project to go forward, he had to approve it. He really didn't at first. I think he eventually saw that we weren't interested in taking Parker and doing what we wanted with him. We were very interested in having him show us what he thought this could be or should be and taking it from there. At that point he definitely started to get more excited about it. The thing that really sold it, he asked me a few questions about how I planned to write it. I e-mailed back, ""I don't plan on writing anything if I can help it. I plan on using your words wherever possible. That's the reason I'm going to do the stories in the year they were written, so that I don't have to rewrite your stories to accommodate cell phones or all the other things that have happened in the world. I want your words on the page."" I think he really appreciated that. Of course I wish he had lived to see this, because I think he would have been delighted. I know his family has been very happy about all of this. We're really proud of the books and what they're doing for Donald's legacy.

"(CNN) -- In ""The Hot Country,"" U.S. troops invade a foreign country where oil interests are at stake, a rising foreign power is looking to derail U.S. forces using cloak and dagger tactics, and there's a gunfight in the desert against insurgent enemies. DÃÂ©jÃÂ  vu, anyone? As contemporary as this story sounds, it doesn't take place in the Middle East, and it's not set in modern times. The latest novel from Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Olen Butler uses the Battle of Vera Cruz and the American invasion of Mexico during that country's civil war in 1914 as its backdrop. Butler takes an often-overlooked chapter of history and turns it into a whip-smart tale of intrigue and espionage. At the center of this swashbuckling thriller is Christopher Marlowe Cobb, an American newspaper war correspondent, better known as ""Kit."" Covering the war in enemy territory, he's nearly shot by a mysterious sniper, joins forces with a double agent, is almost killed by a German army officer and falls in love with a headstrong young Mexican woman who may be mixed up in the revolutionary plot. You don't need to be an expert on the era to enjoy the story, but history buffs will appreciate cameos from real-life characters like Jack London, Richard Harding Davis and Pancho Villa. Butler recently spoke with CNN about his new novel. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What was the spark behind your new novel? Butler: It began with a postcard. I did a book back in 2004 called ""Had a Good Time,"" which was a book of short stories I wrote based on my picture postcard collection. I collect them not so much for the images on the front but the messages written on the back. Although this particular postcard had a terrific image. I describe it in the short story, and that became the beginning of ""The Hot Country."" It was a photo of a man walking on the street. You see him from behind. He's passing a row of adobe shops with Spanish names. Way in the distance on the cobblestone street, you see a man on horseback. If you study his profile, you see it's an American Marine of the era. In the mid-distance, a gaggle of people, mostly women. The postcard author has drawn an arrow to point at one of the women, and on the back he's written, ""After the battle. Notice the pretty seÃÂ±oritas in this photo. The one in white does my laundry."" What he does not mention is, not more than an arm's length away are two dead men lying on the sidewalk in pools of blood. From all of this, I deduced this was the Battle of Vera Cruz in 1914 Mexico. After that, this voice wouldn't let go of me. CNN: You're a bit of a chameleon as a writer; no two novels are the same. What led you to write a historical thriller? Butler: I've always loved the genre, but I just follow where the muse leads me. In this day and age of terrorists operating covertly and wreaking havoc, governments rising and falling from populist revolutions, mass murders in movie theaters and high seas piracy, this is an intense age. All of which is given to us in these tense, brief, highly dramatic outbursts in the various news media. If you're responding to this world around us, for me, the thriller, especially the espionage thriller, seems absolutely the right choice. CNN: What inspired your main character in this novel, Christopher ""Kit"" Cobb? Butler: Biological improbabilities aside, if Ernest Hemingway and Indiana Jones had a bastard son, it would be Kit Cobb. Honestly, this character is very close to me. I went to war. I was in military intelligence in Vietnam. I was a spy. I was a reporter and then an editor in chief of an investigative business newspaper for a decade. I grew up in a theatrical family and trained as an actor. I'm relating major elements of who Christopher Marlowe Cobb is, and the stories he has to tell about himself are reflective of how I see the world right now. I'm thinking of this book as part one of a six- or eight- or 10- or 12-part novel. He's a complex guy, and he's evolving as the series goes on. CNN: You wrote several of your early novels while a commuter in New York. How did that experience impact you as a writer? Butler: That was during my journalist era. I lived in Sea Cliff, Long Island. I rode the Oyster Bay branch into Manhattan, where I worked. My life circumstances were such that if I wanted to be a novelist, I was going to have to do it on the train. This was before laptop computers, so I had a drafting pencil, a legal pad and a Masonite lap board, and amidst all the chaos, I wrote 300 polished words on the train going into New York in the morning and 300 polished words on the train going home at night. You have to write every day to be a real novelist, and there's no excuse not to. I was at an absolute crossroads. Either I'm going to do this under the most difficult circumstances, and I'm going to do it every day of my life, or I won't do it. It represented my fundamental choice to be a writer. CNN: What drives you to keep writing? Butler: I have no choice but to do it. It's these voices inside me. I'm known for doing first-person voices. This book is in Kit Cobb's voice. I wrote several books of very short stories, and in the space of a couple of years I wrote in the voices of 163 different people, including an animal or two. Those voices are there in my artistic unconscious and ask to be heard, and I channel them. CNN: What's the most difficult part of your job? Butler: Self-discipline is one of the things. If you write from your unconscious, your white-hot center, then the place you go into is scary as hell. As the great Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa said, to be an artist means to never avert your eyes. The whole process is multifaceted and a big monolithic challenge. You have to do it every day, and you can't look away. CNN: What's next for you and Kit Cobb? Butler: I just finished the second book in the series, ""The Star of Istanbul,"" which will come out next fall. It opens on the Lusitania in May of 1915, and we'll move on to London and then Istanbul. There's a beautiful silent film star who's a person of interest in this book. There's a lot of derring-do, surprises and revelations. Read an excerpt from ""The Hot Country."" Like CNN Living on Facebook .","Robert Olen Butler's latest novel was inspired by a postcard .

"(CNN) -- Fans of crime fiction know the names Connelly and Koryta well. Two Mikes. Two generations. Two masters of their craft. At 56 years old, Michael Connelly is the established veteran. A former reporter for the Los Angeles Times, he's won every award given to mystery writers. His books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide and been translated into 39 languages. Later this year Connelly marks an important milestone in his career. His best known character, LAPD Detective Harry Bosch, returns in ""The Black Box,"" Connelly's 25th novel in 20 years. The other Mike is Michael Koryta, also an award-winning and best-selling author. You could call him the future of crime fiction. Koryta has published nine novels since 2004, and he's just shy of 30 years old. His latest, ""The Prophet,"" a tale of faith, football and revenge recently debuted on the New York Times bestseller list and is getting rave reviews from fans and critics. The Two Mikes visited Atlanta last week for the Decatur Book Festival, one of the largest literary get-togethers in the country. CNN had a chance to sit down with the two authors to compare notes and get some insight into their highly-successful writing careers. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: You're both reaching new milestones in your careers, how does it feel? Koryta: I feel like I'm exactly a decade behind Michael. He's at twenty years in publishing, I'm at ten. When I came in there were a group of writers who are standard bearers. You look at what they're doing and think this is what I have to go chase. The first book I wrote that was published, my editor was telling me go read Michael Connelly. I said ""I am"" and he said, ""Try again."" Ten years later I'm still getting that advice from everyone. What Michael's been able to sustain for twenty years is almost unprecedented in terms of the quality of the books continuing to improve. It's just remarkable. Hopefully my books are improving. One of the ways I find motivation to improve is looking at someone who is already at a high level and continues to get better with each book. That's really what you want to emulate. Connelly: I don't think I was one who looked at anniversaries and numbers much, but for some reason this one was significant for me. When you're starting out you never believe that you might accomplish writing twenty-five books in twenty years. It's really bizarre to even contemplate. Twenty years was significant as well because of what happened in Los Angeles in 1992. My first book was published in January of that year so it was kind of a new world opening up to me. A few months later the city was torn apart by riots after the Rodney King trial. I really did weigh all these anniversaries and years when writing this book. I think it's the first time I ever really thought about that. The book's about the death of a journalist and during the riots I almost got killed. That's something I worked out in a lot of my books. So that all played into it, there's a lot of nostalgia, all of it was really important to me and I never really had this kind of stuff inspiring me before. CNN: How have you both remained so prolific? Connelly: What Koryta has done is remarkable. My first book wasn't published until I was 36. Now he's almost thirty and on his ninth book. You know I'm bragging about how I'm on book 25 and he's probably thinking about 75. That's hard for me to imagine, what he's doing. I feel like I'm making up for lost time. That's part of what drives me. For some reason, I don't know why I had this idea, maybe because I was 36 when my first book was published, but I wanted to write 36 books before I'm done. I love the play ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" In the movie, Alec Baldwin says, ""Always be closing."" I feel the same way. For me closing is writing, always be doing it. Koryta: I knew at a young age this is what I wanted to do. I look at the fact that I got an early start -- that was a real blessing to me because it gave me a greater opportunity to tell more stories, hopefully, and at the end of the day that's what I want to do. What I love is the writing, it's not having written. I like the process of it. CNN: Do you view writing as a competition or camaraderie? Koryta: I've always felt an incredible amount of generosity from the time I showed up, people going out of their way to help me who didn't have to. It seems like there's a really good spirit of brotherhood, especially in crime fiction. In terms of competition, anytime I read a book that I think is really good, like ""The Black Box,"" I love it and I'm rooting for Michael as a friend but there's also a spark of, this is a better book than what I wrote and now I've got to try and catch up with that. For me, that's the greatest motivation to improve is to see really good writers continue to get better and continue to pull farther away from you. You're always chasing the rabbit, and that's a good thing. Connelly: There's always been a good mix of camaraderie and motivation. We're lucky in the genre we pursue, it's so big. We're not worried about, that book is so good it's going to take sales away from me. You just don't see that. Readers love to read good stuff, so there's no reason to really be competitive. CNN: Do you prefer writing a stand alone novel or a continuing series character? Koryta: What I like about writing a stand alone novel is you're starting with a fresh world and fresh characters. Part of what I love about writing is that journey of discovery where it's all new to me as well. This is my fourth stand alone in a row and I am beginning to get a little bit of an itch now to take a longer ride with a character, to get to know them a little better. In ""The Prophet"" I really fell in love with those characters, there was an emotional connection there that I don't think I've had in a while. It made me think it would be nice to stick with the characters for a little bit and see what happens. My next book will be a stand alone but after that I'm thinking about trying to take a little bit longer ride. Connelly: A series character like Bosch can be a trap but it's a good trap to be in. This idea that it's an unfinished story with more to say. I guess I never write standalones. Even if I come up with a new character, I often bring them back. The last time I introduced a new character was ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" and now that's going on seven or eight years. I'm already writing my next book and it's Mickey Haller, but I kind of feel like creatively I need to come up with something new pretty soon. CNN: If you could steal an idea from the other Michael what would it be? Connelly: I would be an esoteric thief. Maybe it's the comfort of age but I look at what Michael has done with writing different kinds of genres. I've been more straight laced, straight crime. I've never broken away; all my stuff is in the same vein. It takes a certain amount of courage and confidence to pop out a book that's going to be compared to Stephen King instead of Raymond Chandler. So I would steal that kind of creative courage. Koryta: Courage is one word for it. Foolishness might be another. I've been shamelessly stealing from Michael for years. It's his ability to say so much with one simple sentence that has what I call layers of depth. It's the words beneath the words. He does that every book, time after time after time. He'll lay out a beautiful line, Bosch thinking on the surface what is a very simple thought or observation but it has ripples to the past, the present and goes deeper to the core of the character. He has the ability and the confidence to let it ride on top and know that the reader will get it and feel that impact. That's an incredible gift and that's just great writing.","Connelly is a crime fiction veteran, while Koryta may be the ""future"" of the genre .

"(CNN) -- This week super fans from around the world are gathering in New York to celebrate the 159th birthday of the legendary consulting detective Sherlock Holmes. Never mind that Holmes is a fictional character. To this day, in books, TV and movies, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation remains just as popular as he was when he debuted in the late 19th century. Much of Holmes' appeal has always been his amazing mind -- how he is able to solve a seemingly insurmountable mystery through simple observation and deep thought. Wouldn't we all like to borrow from his bag of mental tricks? Just imagine the possibilities if you put Holmes' brain power to use in the workplace, the classroom or social situations. That's the premise of Maria Konnikova's fascinating new book, ""Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes."" Konnikova, a columnist for Scientific American and a doctoral student in psychology, explores the latest science to dissect the inner workings of the iconic detective's mind. In turn, Konnikova uses Holmes as an example of how anyone can learn to think more clearly, improve his or her memory and generally increase everyday mental power. CNN recently spoke to Konnikova about the book and the benefits of learning to think like Holmes. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: How did you become a fan of Sherlock Holmes? Konnikova: I was introduced to Sherlock Holmes by my Dad when I was young. We had a tradition every Sunday night, he would read to us. Different stories, different books. ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" ""The Three Musketeers,"" things kids would really enjoy. One Sunday we started the Sherlock Holmes stories, and it was just a completely eye-opening experience. I remember sitting there riveted. It really stuck with me as I grew older. I realized how powerful they were from a literary standpoint. Conan Doyle was such a phenomenal writer. I don't think people appreciate just how good the work really is. He's masterful with voice, with conversation, with pacing, with description. He has it all down. I was also struck by how incredibly accurate his psychological observations were. Sherlock Holmes became this figure who predated modern psychology, neuroscience and our understanding of how the mind works by more than a century. Combing through the stories, I thought it would be a fascinating way of looking at the mind by using this fictional character. CNN: Can you briefly explain Holmes' thought process? Konnikova: Holmes is really a mindful detective, someone who knows the true value of observation, which means being mindful and in the present moment, really taking in your surroundings, really taking in everything. That type of approach permeates all of his thinking. He's not just aware of his environment; he's aware of himself; he's aware of the contents of his own mind. He has a powerful knowledge of how he thinks, what mistakes he is likely to make. Holmes puts it best when he says it's the difference between seeing and observing. CNN: What is the ""brain attic"" Holmes talks about? Konnikova: It's his analogy for how we store and process information. How is it that we take the world around us and we form it into the permanent memories that we will then use as the basis of future decisions, future thinking, of future knowledge. The reason he uses an attic is twofold. First, an attic is finite. You can't just keep stuffing things up there and expect it not to give. That's true of the mind as well. The human mind is more expandable than an attic, but there is this finite capacity for working knowledge. Which is Holmes' second point, and why the analogy works so well. It doesn't just matter what you put up there; it matters how you do it. So if you think about it like an attic in an old house, if there are just boxes everywhere filled with junk and none of them are labeled, you're not going to be able to find anything. What Holmes tells you is be careful, label everything, make sure everything is organized and accessible. That way, not only will you know where to find it, but you will remember it better. We really only know what we can remember at any given moment. It doesn't matter if you memorized the information, and it's in your attic somewhere. If you can't access it when you need it, you might as well not know it at all. CNN: Are there everyday benefits of learning to think like Holmes? Konnikova: Absolutely, this type of approach can make you healthier, happier and sharper. CNN: Where would you start? Konnikova: The first thing to do -- and this is difficult in our modern environment -- but realize that multitasking is not your friend. When you multitask, you cannot think like Sherlock Holmes. That's just anathema to his mindful approach. If we take chunks out of the day where we focus, where we allow ourselves to just do one thing and nothing else, you'll find your mind becomes better at doing that one thing and better at managing multiple inputs, filtering out distractions and creating a cleaner slate for you to work. When you're cognitively busy, you're not thinking as clearly. If you're someone with a busy schedule who has to multitask all the time, even if you just practice this quiet mindfulness a few minutes a day, just let your mind focus on the present moment, it can make a huge difference in the clarity of your thinking.

"Now that you have kids, you've probably realized that there was actually some sense behind all that advice your mother gave you. There is a lot of sense behind some of mama's advice, but other adages are not quite right. Maybe you can thank her for your perfect posture (even though it took 4,567 reminders to stand up straight) or for insisting on all those family dinners. Then again, some things need not be passed down to yet another generation. Take a look. Mama always said: Eat more! Kids are starving! That's true, but probably not in your house. The clean-plate club isn't where it's at anymore. It's important to give kids the chance to stop eating based on appetite, instead of external cues like an empty bowl, says Marilyn Tanner-Blasiar, a pediatric dietitian at Washington University School of Medicine. It helps them stay attuned to their feelings of satiety. When they lose that connection, the risk of becoming overweight goes up. But moms wouldn't be moms if they didn't worry about their kids' food. It's never going to be easy to let go, but if you give them healthy options and allow them to eat when they're hungry and stop when they're full, the rest will take care of itself. Mama always said: Don't sit so close to the TV -- you'll ruin your eyes . Actually, you won't, and neither will your kids. According to the American Optometric Association, children can't harm their eyes by sitting with their noses practically pressed against the flat-screen. Watching close-up, however, may cause eyestrain, which can lead to headaches, says Dr. Vincent Iannelli, a Dallas, Texas, pediatrician. Eyestrain doesn't worsen vision, but it's not comfortable, either. For healthier viewing, remind your children not to watch in total darkness -- the sharp contrast between the room and the TV can worsen strain -- and have them plop down about ten feet away. But if you have a child who's always sitting really close, she may be having a hard time seeing. Ask her to scooch to a more normal distance, and if she can't see the screen clearly, get her eyes checked. Mama always said: Don't read in the dark . Smart thinking. Just as watching TV in a black void can cause eyestrain, so it goes with reading in low light, says Cathy Doty, a pediatric optometrist in New Bern, North Carolina. And if kids keep it up for long periods (like your voracious reader, who sneaks in extra chapters with a flashlight under the covers), it can lead to intermittent blurred vision and headaches. All of these symptoms resolve with rest, but this behavior can speed the onset of nearsightedness in kids who are genetically predisposed, says Doty. To protect their peepers, make sure kids have at least 60 watts of light to read under and encourage them to keep books (and computer screens) at arm's length and to take frequent breaks.

It will give their muscles the strength needed to maintain alignment -- without nagging! Mama always said: That music is too loud . It probably is. If you have a kid who goes nowhere without her iPod, there's a good chance she's rocking her way to some hearing loss later, says Dr. Craig Derkay, professor of otolaryngology and pediatrics at Eastern Virginia Medical School. If she likes her tunes loud, ask her to take a break every 20 minutes or so. You can also consider springing for noise-canceling headphones: They drown out background sounds, so she'll be less tempted to turn it up. Mama always said: We're having dinner together because that's what families do . She was onto something. Kids are more likely to eat a balanced meal when the family dines together, says Kathleen Burklow, a clinical psychologist in Cincinnati, Ohio. And it's an all-around great way to connect.

"(CNN) -- Everybody has problems here and there. Some are just bigger than others. Maybe a shiftless tenant won't pay his rent, a dishonest contractor is ripping off your Grandmother or a meth-addicted actress murdered your boyfriend. In the land of California noir, a sunny place full of shady people, these are not uncommon problems. When you need a solution, quick, you call Dick Henry. He cuts through the red tape. It may not always be moral, ethical, or legal but he gets the job done. That's his line. He's the shortcut man. Dick Henry is the wisecracking creation of author, P.G. Sturges and the hero of his newest novel, ""Tribulations of the Shortcut Man,"" hitting bookstore shelves this week. This is Sturges' second novel featuring Henry. Set in present-day Los Angeles, Sturges carries on in the classic noir tradition showing the seamy underside of the city and its criminal tendencies. However, Sturges deftly puts his own spin on the hard-boiled detective story. His ""Shortcut Man"" novels are fun, sexy, and darkly humorous. He's now winning rave reviews from critics and fans and drawing comparisons to some noir legends like Raymond Chandler. Sturges took a long and winding path to his success as an author. He's the son of the famed Hollywood screenwriter and director, Preston Sturges, responsible for such classics as ""Sullivan's Travels."" He died when the author was just six years old but the two share a love of quirky characters and screwball plots. P.G. Sturges grew up amongst the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles. He spent time as a submarine sailor for the U.S. Navy, calibrating tools as a metrologist, also as a musician and a screenwriter before becoming a novelist at age 57. CNN recently spoke with Sturges about his burgeoning career, his authorial influences and his famous Father. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: For new readers, tell me a little bit about Dick Henry and what exactly is a shortcut man? Sturges: Dick Henry is a guy who was thrown out of the LAPD. He's ended up in a position where he pursues justice for his clients with the aim not of pleasing the civil code but of actually doing justice for the people. The shortcuts refer to his ignoring various codes, laws, protocols and just doing the right thing. That's what he wants to do, the right thing. CNN: Even though the books are set in present day Los Angeles they have a very classic, noir style. What drew you to this type of story? Sturges: I wish I could say I did it on purpose but I didn't. That's just the way I told the story. The first time I tried writing it in the third person and I realized it wasn't working. Then I tried writing in the first person and I got a flow going. Then I understood how to write for ""The Shortcut Man."" Also, sheerly by chance I found the way to write about any subject that appeals to me is through Dick Henry. So Dick knows as much as I do but when he's wrong about things of course it's my character who's wrong and not me. CNN: You share parts of your past with Dick Henry. Is there a lot of your personality in him and vice versa? Sturges: Oh yes. I am not a shortcut man, though I admire Dick for his strength, his bravery, his success with women and his beautiful cars but I was a submarine sailor and a musician. So when I introduce him and how he became the shortcut man when someone stole his gearshift from his car in Hawaii that is actually a true story. That's really how I handled that. There's a story in the first book about going to the jazz club and trying to impress the girl, bringing up the song, ""All the Things You Are"" by Jerome Kern, impressing her then going up and asking the band to play that song and the guy goes, we just played it man. That actually happened to me too. That's the beauty of this particular character that anything can go in there. So I'm having a great deal of fun writing for Dick Henry and I hope to do that as long as I live. CNN: So how did you go from submarine sailor to musician to successful writer? Sturges: Well, had I been a success at any of the other things I had tried before writing a novel, I would have never got to writing novels. It's just I got tired of writing screenplays, being ripped apart and changed and your name left on them, which is disconcerting. You know a screenplay is a blueprint for a movie and it takes an expert to read a blueprint. Finally, I thought, I'm just going to tell this story the right way at least in one form, so I got around to writing the novel and discovered how much I really enjoy that form. CNN: Your father was the famous Hollywood screenwriter and director, Preston Sturges. You mention him several times in your first book. Was he your inspiration to become a writer? Sturges: He died when I was six years old so I never got to ask him the writing questions that occurred to me later but I certainly love his work. I'm a fan of it and I love it and my appreciation of him because I have few memories left, is the kind way he treated his characters in his movies. My primary knowledge of him like everybody else is through his films but I feel I have a special insight when I watch them. He was known for giving his characters outlandish names and I'm convinced that the reason he did that is because when you give a specific name to a character, in your mind they fully inhabit that name so that name becomes a shorthand for that exact character. So instead of saying Bob you have Truman, and Truman is going to leap to mind and you're going to be able to more easily write in his stead. Like Rutland Atwater, from the new novel, that name was specifically tailored, to me that name sounds like a fat guy. So every time I wrote Rutland he fully was in my mind. I don't know if other people do that but that's why I do that and I think that's why my father did that. CNN: Do you ever think about what your father would say about your novels? Sturges: I think he would very much enjoy them. He would enjoy them because I enjoy them. They're not a drill to write. I don't write to a formula. I think I'm kind to my characters. I don't have anybody who's in there just to accomplish certain things, to facilitate plot twists. I think you create characters and in a book that has any feel of life, they have to act in their own self interest. That means making them real and even the bad ones have good parts in them. CNN: You've been described as a worthy successor to Raymond Chandler but what writers have influenced you? Sturges: Well, there's Arthur Conan Doyle, Patrick O' Brian and his series of novels about the British navy. I like Michael Connelly of course. I've read every bit of Connelly and I love Harry Bosch but who doesn't? I like Charles Bukowski, his novels more than his poetry. I loved Edgar Rice Burroughs growing up, the Mars series, I must have read them ten times. Lately I've been reading Bill Bryson. Recently I read ""Tom Jones,"" also ""War and Peace"" and some Dickens. What I found out about the great writers, they always have humor in their books. They don't set out to be funny but their notice of life as it passes has funny moments and they get it. I like to read more from a civilian viewpoint. I don't read a book to say this is how the author did this and this is how he did that. I just like to read a great story. CNN: What's next for you? Sturges: Book number three is already finished and in the can. I haven't polished it but the manuscript is complete. Signing with Scribner seriously unleashed my ambition. I've been writing all sorts of things. I'm just finishing something now called, ""The Cuckold's Clock."" It's a story about a man living in today's times who comes into possession of a clock that supposedly stops if your spouse is unfaithful. So the clock stops and what do you believe in 2012? It takes place outside Dick Henry's world. It could exist beside it but they don't come together. Apart from that, look for ""Vexations of the Shortcut Man"" next year and I hope you'll read it.

"(CNN) -- ""Waiting for Sunrise,"" the new novel from acclaimed British author William Boyd, is an evocative mix of sex, spies and psychoanalysis. The story opens in Vienna in 1913. English actor Lysander Rief is seeking treatment from a psychoanalyst for an odd sexual ailment. While in the Austrian capital he begins a passionate affair with another patient and it seems Lysander is cured. When the secret tryst takes a dark turn, Lysander is forced to escape Vienna with help from the British consulate. He's not long in London when war breaks out and Lysander enlists in the army. Soon after, he's approached by the men who helped him escape Austria with a proposition he is in no position to refuse. Morphing from actor to patient to soldier to spy, Lysander is plunged into the dangerous world of wartime intelligence as a covert operative. Fans of the author will love and recognize all the hallmarks of Boyd's best books: a historical thriller, rife with espionage, set in the not-too-distant past, featuring an exotic and exquisitely drawn locale and a cameo from a famous historical figure, in this case Sigmund Freud. Boyd also made headlines last week when he was offered the chance to write the next James Bond novel. Boyd is no stranger to the spy thriller genre and an admitted Bond enthusiast and Ian Fleming fan. Accepting the job was, as he puts it, a ""no-brainer."" While Boyd is keeping many details of the superspy's next adventure top secret, in an interview with CNN from his home in London he did give a few hints on what he has in store for 007 and talked at length about his new novel. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What was the spark behind ""Waiting for Sunrise""? Boyd: It's an odd accumulation of things. I was sort of obsessed with Vienna, particularly at the beginning of the 20th century. I'd written a short story and a bit of a novel set there, and I was very interested in that period. Then I got a chance to go there to write an article about Egon Schiele, the tormented artist who died very young. So I went to Vienna for a few days and wandered around, and very early one morning I found myself at the Freud museum, which is his old apartment house, and I had this strange kind of Proustian shiver as I stood outside the front door waiting to be admitted, because it's been kept exactly as it was pretty much. I thought I could have been here 100 years ago coming to seek psychiatric aid to cure whatever problem I had. I suddenly thought what must that have been like to have come to a psychoanalyst all those years ago, and that was the beginning of the novel. It was a good moment. CNN: You invented your own psychotherapy for the novel; tell me a little more about ""parallelism."" Boyd: I thought, should I just use one of the recognized therapies that Freud and Freudian analysts use? And I thought no, it would be much more fun to think up my own. So I came up with this idea of parallelism, which is surprisingly plausible, I think. We do it all the time, we have false memories, we misremember our past. The past is a very vague and blurry place for us. So it seemed to me to be possible to go back into your memories and reinvent them. To replace bad memories with highly detailed new memories, trying to erase the trauma and the neuroses and leave you with something benign. That's a very simplified version of it and you would need to be guided by a therapist but fundamentally parallelism is creating a parallel life for yourself where the bad things didn't happen and only good things took place. See William Boyd discuss ""parallelism"" in his new novel . CNN: You've included a number of real people in your novels, Sigmund Freud, Ernest Hemingway and Ian Fleming among others. What draws you to these historical figures? Boyd: All these people I've written about, like Virginia Woolf, Picasso and Chekhov are all people I'm very intrigued by, sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a slightly malicious way. I've become quite interested in the New Zealand writer Katherine Mansfield, so she may appear in one of my fictions. I've often invented fictitious events in real people's lives. Wherever my interest takes me, I'm capable of imagining aspects of these people's lives or imagining a portrait of them that is very much mine rather than something handed down by biographers or history. It's very much a capricious way for me to get some of my prejudices or fan worship on the page. CNN: You've been asked to write the next James Bond novel; what was your reaction when they approached you? Boyd: What an opportunity, particularly as I'm sort of steeped in Ian Fleming's world and the world of espionage. I'm relatively at home in it and I know a lot about Fleming and his life and his circle. I read all the Bond novels as a younger person but now I'm furiously re-reading them with great intent. So it was a great serendipitous opportunity that came my way because you can't audition for it, you can't volunteer to do it. You either get asked or you don't. So when they said, ""Would you be interested?"" I said, ""You bet."" I'm really looking forward to it. It's going to be great fun, but I'm also going to take it extremely seriously. I'm going to try to write the very best Bond novel I possibly can and take the character to places and situations he hasn't been before. CNN: What do you have in store for the super spy? Boyd: I'm going to be annoyingly tight-lipped about it. I can tell you it's going to be set in 1969. Ian Fleming died in 1964 at the very young age of 56. So it's quite conceivable if Ian Fleming had looked after himself a bit better, he might have been alive in 1969 and writing a Bond novel. By setting it then you're very much in the world of Fleming's Bond. The resonances of the Bond that Fleming created still would influence the Bond that I would write about. That to me is the real appeal. Somehow you're imagining a kind of vicarious life for Ian Fleming, whereby he might have been able to pen another James Bond novel. It's very much tapping into the world we're familiar with. The Cold War was alive and well and in some ways that's the great age of spying, and I know a lot about that period of espionage history. So to be able to plonk down an iconic figure like Bond in the late '60s is a wonderful bonus.

"Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg spoke at a news conference Saturday about the two-pronged attack on his country the previous day -- a shooting at a youth camp that killed at least 85, and a bomb targeting government buildings in the capital, Oslo, that killed seven.  The following is a transcript of his speech: . Last night, it became apparent that what happened at the Labour Youth League summer camp on UtÃ¸ya yesterday was a national tragedy. Not since the Second World War has the country experienced such an atrocity. At least 80 young people have been killed on UtÃ¸ya. We have also lost some of our colleagues in the government offices. It is incomprehensible. It is like a nightmare. A nightmare for the young people who have been killed. For their families. Mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters who have been brutally confronted with death. But also for the survivors and their families. Every single person on UtÃ¸ya has been marked for life. Young people have experienced things that no one should have to experience. Fear, blood and death. I am unable to express with words how deeply I feel with all who have been hit. Today -- in a few hours' time -- I should have been at UtÃ¸ya to meet these young people. Many of them are no longer alive. For me, UtÃ¸ya is the paradise of my youth that yesterday turned into hell. Now we have to do all we can to support and help those who have been stricken by grief. Many people are still working to save lives. I visited Oslo University Hospital last night and applauded the outstanding work the health personnel are doing there. We also extend our thanks to the teams of police and firemen, and many others who are doing a tremendous job. Volunteers have also offered their help. Everyone is doing an impressive job. I appreciate this. We all feel a need to contribute, talk together and take care of each other. Last night, I talked to the leader of the Labour Youth League Eskil Pedersen. He is doing everything he can to comfort and assist everyone who has been hit. Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr StÃ¸re and Minister of Culture Anniken Huitfeldt were at Sundvollen last night and in the early hours to support the young people arriving from UtÃ¸ya and their families. Many people are still waiting for answers. Later today, I will go to Sundvollen to meet these young people and their families. Early this morning, there will be a meeting of ministers who are most immediately affected, and the whole Government will meet later today.

"(Health.com) -- She may be known for her counters full of beauty products, but cosmetics maven Bobbi Brown admits this: Looking gorgeous is not all about makeup. Ask her the secrets to amazing skin and she'll credit her yoga or her daily eight glasses of water. So what about all the stuff in our makeup bags? Of course, that helps, too, Brown says. ""All women are pretty without makeup, but with just a touch they can feel confident and more powerful."" Here, Health's beauty pro shares how she upgraded these women's looksÃ¢â¬âand how you can press refresh, too. Makeover goal: I want to look like I got a great night's sleep . Bobbi says: The number-one question I get is 'How can I look less tired?' You have to know it's a natural thing that happens to all of us as we ageÃ¢â¬âdarkness under the eyes and blotchiness on the skin makes us look sleep-deprived. Many women rely on concealer, but that alone is not enough. The key is to find a foundation, concealer, and corrector that all look natural. Health.com: How to fake a good night's sleep . Start with a corrector, a cream-based formula that brightens up discoloration under the eyes, either in a pinkish tone (if your skin tone falls somewhere between Gwyneth Paltrow's and J. Lo's) or a peachy shade (if you're darker than J. Lo). Then, right over that, apply concealer that's one to two shades lighter than your skin. Those two steps together will make dark circles disappear, but the reason Alexis looks so evened-out in her ""after"" shot is that I followed up with a tinted moisturizer. I like it instead of foundation because it gives enough coverage, but you can still see her skin. To find your right shade, apply it to your cheek. If it disappears, you've met your match! Health.com: Makeup tips from Bobbi Brown . Makeover goal: I want to play up my eyes. Bobbi says: A lot of women apply too much dark or colorful eye shadow. But I find it competes with your eyes instead of accentuating them. I actually believe eyeliner brings out your eyes more. Cristie is wearing a black gel liner along the top lashes and a powder liner on the bottom, plus lots of black mascara (brown is too wimpyÃ¢â¬âI don't even make it anymore!). Going all out on eyes? Keep lips low-key with a pretty pink lipstick and sheer white gloss. Health.com: Tips to make your eyes pop . Makeover goal: I want to look more polished. Bobbi says: The best thing you can do to look instantly more put-together is to define your features. The brows are a great place to start, because they make such a difference to your face with so little effort. If your brows are sparse, like Kirby's, go for a slanted, firm brush and an eye shadow that matches your brow color. Starting at the eyebrows' inner corner, use short, upward strokes, following your natural shape. It also helps to wear blush, particularly a cream formula, which gives a nice glow. Pick a true pink if your skin is Kirby's shade or lighter; if you're darker, try a plummy color. Health.com: More beauty tips from Bobbi Brown .

"(CNN) -- When Kate Middleton walked down the aisle and into the British Royal Family last year, she lifted the spirits of nation mired in economic gloom. Now, 19 months after marrying Prince William, the couple has given the country -- and the Commonwealth -- another reason to celebrate. On Monday, the palace announced that the couple is expecting a baby, though the Duchess of Cambridge had been admitted to hospital with severe morning sickness. Latest: William and Catherine expecting royal child . The woman carrying the next in line to the British throne after William is the daughter of self-made millionaires from rural England. Catherine, 30, grew up in a small village of thatched cottages in Bucklebury, around 45 miles west of London. One of three children, Catherine completed her schooling as a boarder at the prestigious Marlborough College before taking a degree in History of Art at St. Andrew's University in Fife, Scotland, in 2001. It was there that she met Prince William, then the 19-year-old son of Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, and Princess Diana. Both were studying art history when they met, but Catherine is said to have played a key role in encouraging the prince to switch to a degree in Geography in his second year. The students grew closer after moving into a shared house with two other friends and were said to have started dating in late 2003. Their status as a couple was made public in March 2004 when they were photographed holidaying together in the Swiss ski resort of Klosters. Their relationship attracted intense media interest and the following year her lawyers filed their first official complaint about media intrusion. Catherine and William baby news sparks media frenzy . Such was the level of media interest in the girl ""who could be Queen"" that in 2007, the Guardian newspaper reported that Catherine ""ran the gauntlet of more than 20 press photographers and five television crew as she emerged from her flat."" It was her birthday and rumors had spread that the prince would mark the day with a proposal. The incident was quoted during a UK parliamentary inquiry into the self-regulation of the press and the efficacy of Britain's Press Complaints Commission Code of Practice. In his testimony, The Sun newspaper's royal photographer Arthur Edwards described the duchess's frequent run-ins with the paparazzi. ""She has been stopped at traffic lights, where they climb off their motorbikes and start photographing her. She has been out shopping in stores and they run into the stores after her. She uses public transport a lot -- or she did -- but they climb on the buses and the bus driver is having to throw them off,"" he said. The proposal never came and one month later, ""Kate and Will"" were back in headlines as it emerged that their four-year relationship was over. The split was said to be amicable with the couple determined to remain friends. At the time, photographer Arthur Edwards told CNN that the couple's ages and constant media attention took their toll. ""William has said 28 is a good time to get married -- 28 to 30. Now, that's a few years off yet and I don't think she wants to put up with that for the next four or five years, every morning coming out of her house going to her office having those problems, and I think she just thinks enough's enough,"" he said. Royal commentators speculated that the split was due to the class divide between the prince and his middle-class girlfriend. Catherine's mother is a former air stewardess and her father worked as a pilot before they set up their own business. Catherine is the eldest of their three children. Despite conjecture over the cause of their split, the pair remained close. In July 2007, Catherine sat in the royal box at Wembley Stadium in London for the Concert for Diana, a massive charity concert to remember Prince William's mother, Princess Diana, 10 years after her death in a car crash. The two were seen together several times over the summer and were dating again by the end of 2007. Around the same time, Catherine resigned from women's fashion chain Jigsaw, where she started working as an accessories buyer after graduating from university in 2005. However, it wasn't until October, 2010 that William asked for Catherine's hand in marriage in a remote hut in a wildlife reserve on the slopes of Mount Kenya, Africa's second highest peak. Wedding fever gripped the UK as royal-watchers and the general public speculated for months about what Catherine would wear, her hair and the scale of the event in a country entrenched in austerity measures. Street parties were planned and a myriad of royal memorabilia lined shelves as the country prepared for an influx of visitors. Then finally, on April 29, 2011, Catherine married Prince William in a televised ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, becoming Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge, before an audience of millions.

In January 2012, the duchess announced the four charities she would support as a patron: the Art Room, which helps disadvantaged children express themselves through art; the National Portrait Gallery, which houses a famous collection of royal paintings and photographs; East Anglia's Children's Hospices, which helps children with life-threatening conditions; and Action on Addiction, which assists those with addiction issues. Since then, the duchess has braved her first public speech and traveled with her new husband to meet royal supporters in Canada and more recently in Southeast Asia. The latter was marred by controversy over a decision by a French magazine to publish images of the duchess sunbathing topless while on a private holiday with William in France. The couple took legal action action the magazine, French Closer, in September, which was also fined by a French court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online. It was also told to hand over the photos to the royals within 24 hours. Read more: Angry royals take Catherine's topless photo battle to court . The Duchess of Cambridge was last seen in public during an official tour to Cambridge, England last week, when there was more talk about her new hairstyle than any speculation of pregnancy. The palace has declined to name a due date, as Catherine is less than 12 weeks pregnant. She's expected to remain in hospital for several days while doctors treat her for Hyperemesis Gravidarum, a condition that causes acute morning sickness. Prince William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the throne after William regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, the British Cabinet Office said Monday. Last year, Commonwealth leaders agreed to change British succession laws to allow a female to take the throne ahead of a younger brother.","Prince William, Duchess of Cambridge expecting first child .

"(CNN) -- James Patterson may be the top-selling writer in the world; he might very well be the busiest, too. Patterson has three books near the top of the bestseller lists right now. His latest, ""Guilty Wives,"" arrives in stores next week. With the help of his co-writers, Patterson is turning out about 10 books a year. Patterson holds the world record for the most No. 1 bestsellers of any author. He's also the first author to reach 5 million e-books sold. All together, he's sold an astounding 220 million books worldwide. Adult fans love Patterson for novels such as ""The Women's Murder Club"" or his Alex Cross series. A new movie starring Tyler Perry as the detective is coming this year. Younger readers love Patterson for titles like ""Maximum Ride"" and ""Witch & Wizard"" or his Middle School series. When he's not writing books, Patterson is working to get more kids to read through his website, ReadKiddoRead.com. He's also sent thousands of books to U.S. troops overseas. This month. Patterson donated 200,000 books that are now on their way to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with the help of organizations like Operation Gratitude and Books for Heroes. CNN recently caught up with the bestselling writer to talk to him about his latest novel and his philanthropic efforts. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: Let's start by talking about Operation Gratitude and how you recently donated thousands of books to U.S. troops. Patterson: Books are on the way overseas this week, which is the big subject for me. It started in part because a friend of mine, a partner in my entertainment company, was a captain in Vietnam, and his son did a couple of tours in Iraq. He's a bright guy; he used to send letters home every week and also letters from his friends. I read a lot of them, and they were really kind of mind-blowing in terms of just putting you in touch with what it's like to be a soldier overseas right now. It really got me interested. If I could, I would like to shake the hands of everybody over there, because I don't think they get the attention that they should. I can't do that, so we're going to put 200,000 books in the hands of thousands of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan instead, which I think is a big deal. CNN: What kind of feedback have you received from U.S. servicemen and -women for your efforts? Patterson: We've been doing this on a smaller scale for five or six years now, 20 or 30,000 books, so I've had hundreds and hundreds of letters and ... lots of pictures, with troops saying, 'here I am reading your book in some sort of foxhole or in my truck or jeep or whatever.' I also hear from families, people from home saying, 'I got a note from our son, and he talked about getting a couple of your books,' and that's very cool. It's very rewarding. CNN: You're also a big believer in getting kids to read. Patterson: It's a huge thing with me. Getting the books out, going to schools, talking to kids about how important it is for them to read so that they really become better human beings. I think at this stage in our civilization, I think books are probably the best place to get varying points of view on things, understand how other people think and live their lives and have more understanding and compassion for people. Obviously, if a kid can't read well by the time they get out of middle school, most likely they're going to have problems. It's just so much harder to go through school and get a decent job. The implications are huge. There are a lot of things we as individuals can't do much about. We can't solve global warming as individuals or health care problems, but as individuals, most of us can get our kids reading. We can do that. Patterson's recent CNN.com essay on getting your kid to read . CNN: You have several books on the bestseller list right now, a new novel coming out and a handful of others in the works, plus your other projects. So how do you keep up with everything? Patterson: Oh, yeah, the books, too. I don't know. I don't feel stressed out. It's just a pattern I am comfortable with. I get up every morning and chop wood, and I pretty much do it seven days a week, and I like to do it. I still have time for my wife and my son, who's 14, and at this point, my head is still above water. I think part of it is, you can take on more, and you do, but at a certain point I may say, that's it. I can't do anymore. I read a fair amount, but I don't read as much as I used to, so that's suffered a little. CNN: You work with a number of co-authors on some of your books. How do you divide the workload? Patterson: We alternate words. Just kidding. Actually, I write an outline of about 50 to 60 pages that will lay out every chapter. I then ask the co-writer to contribute to the outline. I want their opinions, and I want them to feel they're part of the process right from the get-go. Then they will write a draft. I like to look at things every two weeks. That way you can say 'that part's great' or 'hold it, let's talk about this.' I was just talking to Mike Ledwidge a little while ago; he and I do the Michael Bennett books. When I have a first draft, then I will do another, and in some cases I've done, seven, eight, nine drafts. And that's the process. I do the outline, the co-writer does the first draft, and I'll do subsequent drafts. Although my co-writers might call it 'Jim screwing up the book,' but so far, it's working well. CNN: ""Guilty Wives"" comes out next week. What was the spark behind this book? Patterson: I had this idea of four women going off on a cool vacation and getting in big trouble, really big trouble. They're accused of murder in France, and it's a huge, huge trial, and I don't want to give too much away, but I really liked that idea. CNN: What are you working on next? Patterson: There's the next Alex Cross and then a couple of kids books, a follow-up to ""Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life."" I'm trying to write books that are really funny but also have things for kids to sink their teeth into and think about. I'm writing one now about middle school and summer camp, and then right around Christmas, I'll have a book about a middle school kid who desperately wants to be a stand-up comedian, and he knows every joke in the history of mankind, so that's kind of a fun one. CNN: How is the Alex Cross movie coming together? Patterson: I've been to two test screenings, and I visited the set, and it's looking really, really good. Tyler Perry is going to blow everybody's mind. He's very, very good. Not that you wouldn't expect that, but he hasn't done this kind of a movie before. You'll see him as a very dramatic, very physical actor. Also, Matthew Fox is going to blow people's minds as the bad guy. It's unusual for a thriller, because it's both exciting and very emotional. I think it's going to do extremely well. CNN: How do you come up with all of your story ideas? Patterson: Sometimes it can just be a title, or I just have a sense that I can build a story around something and I'm going to like the story. I have to feel emotional about it to do it. I used to, like a lot of writers, get up at 2:30 in the morning and start scribbling stuff down. I've kind of stopped doing that, because the good ideas I tend to remember. I have more than enough ideas right now. I have a folder in my office with about 400 ideas in it. So it will take me another 40 years to get through those.

"(REAL SIMPLE) -- Tom Delavan, an art buyer who specializes in fine contemporary art, also has an incredible knack for making affordable art look sophisticated. We asked him how to decorate the walls without robbing a bank. Real Simple: How did you develop your art expertise? Tom Delavan: After business school, I became intrigued by the art world and ended up at a training program at Sotheby's, where I was later hired as a contemporary-art specialist. Then I helped found the Gramercy Art Fair, in New York City, which is now the Armory Show. Real Simple: You're also a designer. Real Simple: Easy paint makeovers . Delavan: Yes. I was curating art for a client when he asked me to decorate his home. That led to work for the home-design magazine Domino. Now I'm the creative director of the shopping site Gilt Home. Real Simiple: Can you tell us why art is so tricky? Delavan: Because it's truly about personal taste. It's more art than science. Real Simple: What if you don't know what your taste is? Delavan: You can figure it out. Gather images of rooms you're drawn to and take a look at the kind of art in them. Maybe it's all watercolorsâor black-and-white photos. Real Simple: Then what? Delavan: Think about your space. There shouldn't be a disconnect between the decor and the art. If you have a glamorous room, for example, you don't want flea-market art in beat-up frames. It would be better to go with something more polished, with a gold or silver frame. Real Simple: Fill in the blank: Types of art that tend to look good at all price points include ________. Delvaan: Black-and-white photography, graphic posters, small drawings, and sketches. Nice, large figurative paintings are hard to find at a low price, so maybe steer clear of those. Real Simple: Transform a corner of your home . Real Simple: What sites do you like for affordable art? Delavan: Artriver.com has some fantastic modern-art prints, and momastore.org is great for fine-art prints. Gilt Home has nice reproductions of iconic art from McGaw Graphics and mixed-media work from artists like Parvez Taj. Real Simple: What's the difference between posters and prints? Delavan: Posters are reproductions that are unlimited in number; prints are often limited editions signed and numbered by the artist. Real Simple: How do you make posters look their absolute best? Delavan: Some have text on the bottom. If you cut that off before framing, they can look so much better. Real Simple: 12 quick fixes for your household things . Real Simple: Any rules of thumb on framing? Delavan: Affordable art should have affordable frames. Affordable ornate frames are usually not good, so I would stick with simple, thin black or white frames. What you want to avoid is taking your $60 poster to a frame shop for a $300 frame. Real Simple: But doesn't framing cost a fortune no matter what? Real Simple: 11 bedroom makeovers . Delavan: Check out wholesaleposterframes.com. You give them the size of your art, and they send you a frame that you put together. It's easyâI've done it. It looks almost like a custom frame. Real Simple: Say that you want to fill the space above a sofa and you have a budget of $200. Delavan: I would bring a family photo that doesn't look stagedâsomething candid or abstractâto Staples and have it blown up to about 30 by 40 inches, then frame it. Black and white feels more artsy, so that's one way to make it cooler. Real Simple: What if you have $500? Delavan: Get three works by the same artist, frame them the same way, and hang them in a row. Real Simple: 14 living-room and dining-room makeovers . Real Simple: How about a bigger budget, like $2,000? Delavan: Look at local galleries. Prints and photos tend to be the least expensive options. Most places let you take things on approval. You may have to pay, but you can get a refund if the piece doesn't work. Real Simple: How do you put together a wall of art? Delavan: There should be some commonality, like a consistent color palette or size. If there isn't, frame all the art the same so that the look is unified. On the wall in my home office, I have reproductions of Robert Indiana's Love and Roy Lichtenstein's Ball of Twine 1963. It's charming to add a postcard, a calendar, or even kid art. Some of my favorite works are by four-year-old friends.Real Simple: Any secret sources that we might not think of? Real Simple: 21 ways to enhance an entryway . Delavan: Museum shops. If you go to an exhibition and love it, see if there's a cool object or poster. Sometimes they're hokey, so don't pick the most iconic thing, like a reproduction of Michelangelo's David. Go for something less obvious, less recognizable. Real Simple: Some people recommend shopping student shows at art schools. Any advice on this? Delavan: I would focus on pieces that are conceptual or abstractâbig swashes of paint or something really geometricâbecause students are just starting to develop their technical skills. Real Simple: Bottom-line it for us. Delavan: Art should make you happy. Sometimes people buy things to impress others, but you damn well better like the pieces on your wall when you come home. Good art collectors know to shop from the heart, and that applies at any price. Get a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE! Copyright Â© 2011 Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Imagine a smoke-filled jazz club, dark and crowded. The sounds of a trumpet solo echo on stage, while a piano, bass and drums pound out a finger-snapping groove. You can almost smell the cigarette smoke, taste the cheap booze being served. This is Berlin, 1939 -- the eve of World War II. These are the Hot Time Swingers, the imagined jazz band at the center of Esi Edugyan's ""Half-Blood Blues."" The novel was a finalist for Britain's prestigious Man Booker prize in 2011 and reaches U.S. bookstores this week. The story is told through the eyes of the Swingers' bass player, Sid Griffiths, in alternating takes between events in Paris and Berlin in 1939 and Baltimore and Berlin in 1992. The novel captures the end of the jazz age in Germany perfectly in the characters' staccato slang, sounding much like jazz music imagined as dialogue. Offstage, the story captures the paranoia and fear of the days leading up to the start of the war, and the racial tension of the time period. Sid narrates, but the band's brilliant young trumpet player, Hieronymus ""Hiero"" Falk, is the linchpin of the story, a German who happens to be black. Hiero's prodigy-like talent brings the band success, love and rivalries among its members. After being banned by the Nazis as ""degenerate"" music, the Swingers escape to Paris, where they meet Louis Armstrong. But then war breaks out, and the Gestapo arrests Hiero in a cafÃÂ©. He is never heard from again. Jump ahead 50 years. Falk has become a cult hero among jazz fans. He's now the subject of a documentary film. Sid and the only other surviving band member, Chip Jones, are invited to the film's premiere in Berlin. As they return to celebrate their long-lost friend, Sid, the only witness to Hiero's disappearance, is forced to reveal a decades-old secret. ""Half-Blood Blues"" is the second novel from Edugyan, an author with a bit of a globe-hopping past. She was born and raised in Canada, the daughter of immigrant parents from Ghana. She has studied and lived in the United States and across Europe, including stops in Iceland, Spain and Germany. Now married and mother to an infant daughter, Edugyan lives in Victoria, British Columbia. CNN recently asked her about the novel in a phone interview and via e-mail. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What was the spark behind your book? Edugyan: I was living in Germany at the time, acutely aware of my difference -- being a black woman from Canada. At the same time I'd been reading about the so-called ""Rhineland Bastards"" -- the half-black children of France's colonial soldiers from Africa stationed in the Rhineland after the close of the first World War. I began imagining their lives in Germany, as both outsiders and insiders, and this naturally led to my wondering what must have happened to them during the 1930s, with the rise of Nazism. This is where my interest in the novel came from. But the book itself more rightly begins with Sid's voice, his character, the perplexing problems of loyalty and betrayal in any artistic life. CNN: You really captured the feel, the language and the tone of the late 1930s European jazz scene. Did you research this period extensively before you started writing? Edugyan: Thank you, that's kind of you to say. I researched assiduously, both before and during the writing, to capture the feel of that world. But Sid's voice is so very particular to Sid himself that I would never want it to stand in as some sort of ""representative"" voice from that time. It's an approximation of the kind of hybrid language he and his band mates were speaking at the time. But it's important to remember, too, that Sid is a man straddling two eras -- 1930s Europe and 1990s Baltimore -- and the shifts in his rhythms, diction, syntax hopefully capture some of that flavor. CNN: I pictured you listening to a lot of jazz from this time period while you were writing. Did you and were there any jazz artists in particular that inspired you? Edugyan: It's interesting to hear you say so. The music was my constant companion, even more than books. Not only as a way to lead me back into the novel after each break but also as a kind of consolation. There was a strength and faith and promise in it that I think I needed at the time. What's fascinating to me now is to think back on who I was listening to at various points in the novel and read the book with that in mind. Not only the language itself, but the speed and emotion under the prose finds a corollary in the music. Or so it seems to me in retrospect. Among the artists I listened to most often were Sidney Bechet, Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong. CNN: Your novel focuses on the Nazi persecution of the Afro-German community. What drew you to this little known chapter of pre-World War II history? Edugyan: As the Canadian-born daughter of Ghanaian immigrants, I grew up between worlds, in a sense, aware both of my differences and kinships. Loyalties were always mixed, and the world inside the walls of my home was significantly different from the world beyond it. I did my graduate work at Johns Hopkins, living in Baltimore for a short time, which reinforced this complicated sense of identity. And in the years since, I lived on and off in Europe, where, as ever, I had periods of feeling profoundly at home and periods of total estrangement. I think that sense of uprootedness, that quiet seeking after identity and self, lies at the heart of this novel. ... In the writing itself, you're not thinking about such things. You just know that there's a story there, one you want told. And you run with it. CNN: While Sid narrates the novel, this really felt like Hiero's story to me. He's such a compelling character but remains something of an enigma. I assume this was by design? Edugyan: Absolutely. That unknowability lies at the core of the novel. It seemed it would have been an act of extraordinary presumption to take Hiero's voice, to speak for him, to fill that silence. And, too, a way of diminishing the sadness of what he (and his real-life counterparts) suffered. CNN: You come from such an interesting background, the child of Ghanaian ÃÂ©migrÃÂ© parents, born and raised in Canada. You've studied in a number of countries, including the U.S. and Europe. You now live in British Columbia. How has all that world travel influenced you as an artist and a person? Edugyan: ... There can be something liberating ... for the fiction writer who finds herself caught between worlds. An opportunity to observe and inhabit the skins of others. I know, for myself, that all of that traveling has impacted the kinds of stories I am drawn to. CNN: You're also the mother of a young child. Has that changed your approach to writing? Edugyan: Oh, it's still so early to tell -- our daughter is only 6 months old. But that, too, is turning out to be a different kind of journey. CNN: What's next for you? Edugyan: I find myself staring out the windows an awful lot these days, dreaming up the next book. But our daughter fills up the immediate hours of the day.

"(CNN) -- Muffled gun shots and squealing tires. A secret midnight meeting in a dark alley. Alone in an exotic city with enemies lurking around every corner. Everyone recognizes the classic elements of a good cloak and dagger story. From James Bond to George Smiley, the spy thriller is one of literature's most popular and enduring genres. Right now the hottest name in this field is Olen Steinhauer. He's been called John le CarrÃÂ©'s heir apparent, and the best espionage writer of his generation. For anyone who reads spy novels, that's high praise. Steinhauer is an American who has lived abroad for a good part of his adult life. He burst on to the publishing scene in 2003 with ""The Bridge of Sighs,"" the first in a critically acclaimed five book series chronicling the cold war in a fictional eastern-bloc country. He followed that up with a thoughtful and thrilling trilogy about a reluctant CIA agent, Milo Weaver, who's trying to survive and keep his family safe in a post 9/11 world. The first in that series, ""The Tourist"" was a bestseller, the second; ""The Nearest Exit"" won the 2010 Dashiell Hammett prize for best literary crime novel. Now Steinhauer returns with ""An American Spy."" Debuting in book stores this week, it's his third novel to feature Weaver, formerly a member of the ""Department of Tourism,"" the CIA's home for black ops and dirty tricks. The story picks up after a Chinese spy master has nearly wiped out the department. Milo is now one of only a handful of ""tourists"" -- a code name for CIA assassins -- left in the agency. When Milo's boss disappears and his family is threatened, Milo is drawn into a conspiracy that may link the Chinese government to the highest levels of American intelligence. CNN recently spoke to Steinhauer about his newest novel. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What is it about the spy novel that has captured your imagination as a writer? Steinhauer: My first two books were more police procedurals, but I soon came to realize that I was more comfortable in the looser genre of spy fiction. One reason was simple practicality -- cops follow very specific procedures that as a writer you either adhere to or you don't. If you don't, you're being unrealistic, and if you do, there's a possibility you'll end up straight-jacketed by these rules. So I gravitated toward the more free-flowing world of espionage. Spies follow procedures, but they vary by agency and, by and large, we in the public don't know what they are, so the writer is given a lot more latitude. More importantly, though, I find the grayness of espionage compelling. In crime fiction, the antagonist is usually the ""bad guy"" in the literal sense. In espionage, these labels are harder to affix, at least in my mind. If the antagonist is, say, a spy for China, he's just someone doing what he can to advance his own country's cause. The protagonist in a spy novel is doing the same thing. They are -- or can be -- equals, even when they commit morally heinous acts, and I love that moral quandary. It also explains why, thus far, I haven't been writing terrorist antagonists -- they're much harder to empathize with. CNN: Do you think readers love spy novels for the same reasons? What do you think is behind the genre's enduring popularity? Steinhauer: Reader responses to spy novels seem to be as varied as the kinds of spy novels out there. Some love high levels of realism, even if it means a spy spends most of his time at a desk, whereas others love spy stories for the action, no matter how unlikely it is. Some are attracted by the illusion that they're being given the keys to a secret world, one they would never be allowed into otherwise. Some like being reassured by patriotic rhetoric, while others are reassured by the cynicism that many spy novels wallow in. As for its enduring popularity, I suppose that deception -- whether it's found in crime novels or spy novels -- is just too thrilling for readers to go long without. CNN: You lived in Europe for a number of years, how did this influence your story telling? Steinhauer: The European influence began with a few weeks' student exchange in high school, to Cologne, Germany. I was 14 at the time, and the exoticism of small details was immediately interesting to me -- I of course romanticized it all. In college, I did a semester abroad in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. A momentous year -- it was 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, and it was then that I decided to become a writer. So my fascination with that part of the world began early. Just before writing ""The Bridge of Sighs"" 11 years later, I spent a year on a Fulbright fellowship to Romania, and all the research I did there shaped ""The Bridge of Sighs"" and helped direct the course of the next four books, which charted the Cold War history of Eastern Europe. By the time I was writing my second book, ""The Confession,"" I was living in Italy and then in Hungary, where I've spent the last decade. While all this European living has influenced the subject matter of my novels, I think more importantly it's given me a window onto the world that's different than the one I would've had if I'd spent the last 10 years in the States. I was in Italy when 9/11 occurred, and I've experienced the entire post-9/11 era through more distant eyes. CNN: Did the 9/11 attacks change your approach to writing a spy novel? Steinhauer: Well, I'd only finished one book by 9/11, and I think at first my literary reaction was withdrawal. Terrorism, and radical Islam, seemed so complex and unknowable that instead of properly educating myself, I stuck with knowable history. It took a while before I recognized what I was doing, so by the time I finished my Cold War sequence, I was chomping at the bit to give the contemporary world a try. Thus, ""The Tourist,"" which tried to deal squarely with contemporary international relations. Which is another way of saying that, after 9/11, I took my time getting around to the subject. That said, you'll notice that the Milo Weaver books deal less with terrorism than with the way terrorism has influenced other aspects of espionage and international relations. CNN: What kind of research did you do for ""An American Spy""? Did you meet with any real agents? Steinhauer: I wish I could say I did! But, no. My research is almost entirely scattershot -- I pick up information through online research, through books -- both nonfiction and fiction -- as well as movies. I'm less interested in the technique of espionage as I am in the psychology of that world, and there are so many ways one can glean this kind of information. There's a lot to be said for the power of imagination -- when the writing's going well, the results can be shockingly correct. For example, when my French editor read the manuscript of ""The Tourist,"" he sent me a complimentary e-mail, saying that as a ""lifelong Parisian"" he was impressed that I'd gotten Paris perfectly. What I hesitated to tell him was that, by the time I wrote that book, I'd never stepped foot in Paris! CNN: The ""spy craft"" in your book feels very authentic, is it rooted in reality or strictly from your imagination? Steinhauer: It's a bit of both. Through reading I'll come across actual craft that I pick up, though you'd be surprised how much realism you can acquire by simply getting into a character's head and turning on the paranoia. If I wanted to get from Miami to Chicago without anyone knowing, how would I go about this? With a basic knowledge of how cell phones can be tracked, how surveillance cameras pepper highways and public spaces, one can gradually form a plan that looks a lot like real spy craft. And if it works, then there's no reason to think it isn't spy craft. CNN: I hesitate to call him ""the bad guy"" but tell me more about how you came up with Chinese spymaster, Xin Zhu. Steinhauer: I've written very few ""bad guys"" in my time, and each time I've regretted it. Xin Zhu, like any good antagonist, simply has different aims than our protagonist. Since I don't outline my stories or characters ahead of time, I don't ""come up"" with characters before settling down to write a story -- instead, the characters are shaped by the story that's coming together. There's a lot of give and take between plot and character, so that it's hard to tell where any particular thing comes from. Which is another way of saying that Xin Zhu is not based on anyone I know of, and that there's more mystery in writing than books on writing would have you believe! CNN: What's next for you, will there be another Milo Weaver novel? Steinhauer: I'm taking a break from Milo's world and delving into North Africa -- a book about spies that touches on the Libyan revolution. As I said, it's giving me a serious headache, but in my experience novels that get written easily are usually less compelling than the difficult ones, so I live in hope.

"(CNN) -- Bookshelves are bursting with a bevy of great new titles this spring but we wanted to highlight a trio of new thrillers that truly bring history to life. 'The Lifeboat' by Charlotte Rogan . ""The Lifeboat,"" by first-time author Charlotte Rogan, is a harrowing story of survival that reads like a cross between ""Titanic"" and ""Lord of the Flies."" Set in 1914, Grace Winter and her new husband sail from London to New York aboard a luxury liner. Somewhere in the Atlantic their ship sinks under mysterious circumstances. In the chaos, Grace flees the ship aboard one of the few lifeboats, while her husband goes missing. But her struggle is just beginning. The lifeboat is dangerously over capacity, there is little food and water, dangerous storms on the horizon and a desperate power struggle brewing among the survivors. Grace is forced to choose sides as passengers plot and scheme to stay alive long enough to be rescued. I'm not revealing too much by telling you not everyone in the novel will make it to dry land. The story behind ""The Lifeboat"" is compelling in itself. It is inspired in part by a real-life case from 1841, when the captain of a ship tossed 12 people overboard to save the rest of the passengers from sinking, only to be found guilty of murder later. The novel marks Rogan's publishing debut. A wife and mother of now-grown triplets, she spent more than a decade working on her story off and on, and signed her first book contract shortly after her 57th birthday. The book is winning rave reviews from critics and some respected writers, as well as generating some serious buzz among booksellers. Read an excerpt from ""The Lifeboat."" 'The Gods of Gotham' Lyndsay Faye . Lyndsay Faye gives readers a glimpse into New York's turbulent past in her thrilling new novel, ""The Gods of Gotham."" It's 1845 in Manhattan, a time of violent growing pains for a metropolis awash in immigrants and a dangerous vigilante spirit. Two history-shaping events collide to set the story in motion: the founding of New York's police force and the great influx of Irish-Catholics fleeing the potato famine. The novel's central character is Timothy Wilde, an ex-bartender who has lost everything -- and nearly his life -- in a devastating fire. He's conscripted by his older brother into the fledgling police force, called ""copper stars."" Wilde patrols one of New York's worst wards, what would eventually become Hell's Kitchen. He's not long on the beat before he literally stumbles across a child prostitute covered in blood, which leads to the discovery of a string of horrific murders. All the victims are immigrant children. Wilde, a whip-smart and appealing hero, sets out to catch the killer and protect those closest to him. Wilde must crack the case without the help of modern inventions as fingerprints and forensics. He's left to rely on little more than his wits and a police whistle. Faye has meticulously researched her novel, filling page after page with period detail and compelling characters but the story remains engaging and fast paced. Much of the dialogue is written in the authentic slang of the day, called ""flash."" It's the historical jargon of the streets and lends an authentic voice to the book. While ""The Gods of Gotham"" is set more than 150 years in the past, its imagined world of poverty, crime, sex, drugs and violence feels timeless. Lyndsay Faye talks about writing ""The Gods of Gotham."" 'House of the Hunted' by Mark Mills . Mark Mills' latest, ""House of the Hunted"" takes place nearly 100 years later and half a world away in CÃÂ´te d'Azur, France, 1935. Europe may be moving toward war but travel writer Tom Nash is enjoying an idyllic life on the French Riviera. He lives in a seaside villa, enjoys sailing the Mediterranean and hosting dinner parties for his friends, a community of ex-pats and artists. His peaceful routine is shattered when an assassin tries to kill him in the dead of night. It quickly comes to light that Tom's secret history as a British intelligence agent has caught up to him. Now he must confront the violent deeds of his past, an undercover mission in Russia gone wrong and the memories of a long-lost love. Someone knows Tom's secrets and is back for revenge. Now Tom must rely on his old instincts and once again become the dangerous man he used to be. Mills' story is suspenseful and romantic, vividly drawn and engaging, reminiscent of some of the best spy novels of the past. Readers will recognize echoes of Eric Ambler, Graham Greene and Alan Furst but ""House of the Hunted"" stands on its own and won't leave espionage fans disappointed.

"(CNN) -- The annual San Diego Comic-Con, North America's biggest popular arts convention, is a gathering of fans and celebrities from all over the world. Micro-video apps like Vine and Instagram were everywhere this year at the convention, and CNN iReporters took on the challenge of doing 15-second interviews with interesting people -- both famous and not-so-famous -- that they ran into during the long weekend. The results, though not always exactly 15 seconds, were a snapshot of the many varying events and people who populate the Con each year. From fans celebrating their favorite shows on Syfy, to the ever-growing phenomenon of cosplay, to the stars of the TV series ""Impractical Jokers"" talking about their favorite practical joke, Jack Black's cape, unusual hats, and yes, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle stalking, here's a quick look at how the Con has evolved into a smorgasbord of pop culture. Thanks to iReporters Joyce Chow, Christiane Elin, Lisa Hernke, James Lewis, Chris Morrow and Tony Perri for sharing their video interviews. First, William Shatner confesses his most memorable (if not downright scary) fan moment to a group including Chris Morrow. Meet just a few of the other celebrities who promote TV series at Comic-Con every year, as Christiane Elin interviewed Aisha Tyler and the ""Impractical Jokers."" (truTV is a Time Warner network, like CNN.) Cosplay, short for ""costume play,"" has grown in popularity at Comic-Con, as seen in this video from Tony Perri. Jack Black spoke to Morrow about his love of the capes that came with the official Comic-Con bags. Another example of the random encounters at the Con comes from Lisa Hernke and Christiane Elin (who spoke to ""Haven"" fan Jon Allen from Riverside, California). TV's No. 1 show, ""The Walking Dead,"" had a big launch at Comic-Con in 2010, and every year the show's elaborate booth outdoes itself. Perri and James Lewis checked it out. The chance to play the Playstation 4 was one of the big gaming draws this year, as Morrow found out. Stars of ""Defiance"" and ""Impractical Jokers"" talk at Comic-Con, in videos from Elin and Cherry Davis. ""The Incredible Hulk"" himself, Lou Ferrigno, who has portrayed the character in live action and animation, is an annual presence at the Con. Perri spoke to him. Davis and Elin present more favorite practical jokes and Kristen Hager from Syfy's ""Being Human."" Where do cosplayers get their inspiration? Joyce Chow asked this man playing Wolverine. Lewis attended the ""Game of Thrones"" panel when Emmy nominee Emilia Clarke spoke about her character. Elin came across Los Angeles resident Nikki Renieris wearing a pineapple hat (unusual hats are prevalent at the Con) at an event for the TV series ""Psych,"" and also interviewed cast members from ""Lost Girl."" Ryan ""Agent M"" Penagos from Marvel Comics gave Morrow the rundown on their oversized booth this year. Elin learned more about gaming at the Con from Konami's John Choon, and met Ksenia Solo from Syfy's popular ""Lost Girl."" Comic-Con spokesman David Glanzer discussed the past and future of the convention with Morrow. Perri shot video of the ferry ride to the Con from his home of Coronado, California. Andrew Garfield was in costume as Spider-Man for his panel on ""Amazing Spider-Man 2."" Women are driving the social media conversation at Comic-Con, according to a recent study, and have embraced cosplay more each year, as Morrow found in this series of short interviews. You can't have Comic-Con without preview night, a parade of toys and other merchandise on the convention floor.

"(CNN) -- Multinationals see Ireland as the ""gateway"" to Europe, says the boss of the country's largest food company. Stan McCarthy, chief executive officer of Kerry Group, told CNN that the Irish economy is ""very progressive."" He added: ""I think it [Ireland] recognizes that it cannot rely totally on its own market and it has to look internationally to develop an economy. We have been very successful at attracting multinationals into Ireland."" This attraction is mainly the result of Ireland's low corporation tax, which currently stands at 12.5% and has led to a number of companies becoming headquartered in Ireland. The tax rate is far less than France's, at 33%, and the United Kingdom's, at 24%. This is an issue that has riled Ireland's European partners, given the country's request for sovereign aid from the eurozone's rescue funds in 2010. Prior to the financial crisis of 2008, Ireland was described as the ""Celtic Tiger"" of Europe, due to its rapidly expanding economy and booming property sector. But following a collapse in its banking sector, the country fell on hard times. McCarthy is confident the Irish economy will come back ""much wiser"" and ""pragmatic"" than before, with a focus on prudence.

"London (CNN) -- As tens of thousands of athletes, team officials and visitors gather in London ahead of the Olympic opening ceremony on Friday, security is paramount for the Games organizers and British authorities. And perhaps the biggest headache of all is the challenge of safeguarding the more than 100 heads of state and foreign dignitaries who will attend the opening ceremony at the Olympic Park -- Queen Elizabeth II, first lady Michelle Obama and U.S. presidential hopeful Mitt Romney among them. But should visitors and competitors be worried? Security concerns hit the headlines this month when it emerged that private security contractor G4S, which was supposed to have provided 10,400 guards for the Olympics and Paralympics, would not be able to deliver. As a result, the government is deploying 18,200 troops -- many more than planned and almost twice as many as are in Afghanistan -- in order to remedy the shortfall. About 1,200 of those were called up just this week after being placed on standby. Nonetheless, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the minister responsible for the Games, said Tuesday that the government ""continues to have every confidence that we will deliver a safe and secure Games."" The decision to call up the extra troops was down to ministers' determination to ""leave nothing to chance,"" as they prepare for the largest peacetime event ever staged in Britain, he said. ""G4S numbers continue to rise significantly and we have every expectation that will continue to be the case,"" Hunt added. With three days to go before the opening ceremony, G4S said it had around 5,800 security personnel deployed at Olympic venues, with more being trained and accredited ""each day."" Last week, it said it hoped to have 7,000 fully accredited by the start of the Games, still thousands fewer than it was contracted to provide. While the recruitment failure by G4S is highly embarrassing for the company, the Games' organizers insist that their contingency planning will keep everyone safe. Visitors can certainly expect to see far more visible security measures in place than usual at Games venues and transport hubs. The Ministry of Defence is also guarding the games with two warships, Typhoon jet fighters, Puma helicopters and, perhaps most controversially, surface-to-air missiles on apartment buildings near the stadium, despite objections from residents. Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London organizing group, LOCOG, has said the only real difference resulting from the G4S debacle will be in the ""mix of security"" checking on those at Olympic venues. Home Secretary Theresa May gave a similar message when she was grilled by lawmakers on the matter, saying, ""There is no question of Olympic security being compromised."" Critics have been less positive, with some Labour Party lawmakers concerned that security will be inadequate or that the prominent military presence will make visitors uncomfortable. Security officials in the United States say they are supporting the host nation's efforts during the Games. The U.S. intelligence community has set up a 24/7 center to analyze all threat information coming in during the Olympics in London, a senior American counterterrorism official said Wednesday. Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told the House Homeland Security Committee that the upcoming Games ""present a potential target for terrorists and other disruptive groups."" He said the United States is working closely with its British counterparts to collect, analyze and share potential threat information with the goal of making sure they can ""respond quickly to prevent any possible plotting tied to the Games."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said last week that Washington has offered ""whatever assistance"" the UK needs ""in order to ensure that proper security is provided."" The chief executive of G4S, Nick Buckles, was forced to agree under questioning from lawmakers that the security staffing fiasco is ""a humiliating shambles for the country."" The firm has also agreed to meet the cost of the extra troop deployment, which could run to $77 million. The Home Office said that G4S was suffering from a software problem, which means the contractor cannot guarantee who will turn up where and whether guards have the right training. The guards employed by G4S will be responsible chiefly for such tasks as providing venue perimeter security, a spokesman for the contractor said. This includes manning X-ray machines, searching people, searching vehicles and operating closed-circuit television systems, he said. People with tickets for Olympic events have been sent e-mails giving details of the security requirements for each venue. These include airport-style limits on the size of bags that can be carried and the quantity of liquids that can be taken in. One such e-mail reads, ""Be prepared for security checks when you arrive: this will be like taking an international flight at an airport. It will be busy and you will have to queue, so get there early."" The 18,200 British military personnel deployed for the Games are to help out with the security checks and stewarding at venues, as well as specialist tasks such as bomb disposal and sniffer dog searches. The Royal Navy's largest ship, the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, is moored in the Thames off Greenwich, where it will be a base for helicopter operations and house troops providing security at the Greenwich Park Olympic venue. Additional airspace restrictions are also in force around London and the southeast. Police in London and elsewhere also will play a big role in ensuring security. Well before the G4S debacle hit the headlines, London's Metropolitan Police Service, known as the Met, was planning what it says is its biggest-ever peacetime operation. The operation will ""run for 66 days and cover over 1,000 venues, including those hosting Olympic and Paralympic sports, cultural events and 2012-themed celebrations taking place across the capital,"" the Met website says. On the busiest days, up to 9,500 police officers will be used, including some from forces outside London, for Games-related operations, it says. Officers at Olympic venues will focus on preventing crime and keeping people and their property safe, while G4S is responsible for the security operation, it says. Away from the venues, the Met will also have to provide the usual policing for the city and its visitors. The Games come just over a year after parts of London were rocked by rioting that led to police being brought in from elsewhere in England to help restore control. The threat of a potential terrorist strike has also been in the news in recent days after a number of arrests, although police said the operations were not linked to the Olympic Games. The terror threat level on the UK Home Office website remains unchanged at ""substantial,"" which is the third highest of five levels. The next level up is ""severe,"" which means an attack is ""highly likely,"" and the highest is ""critical,"" meaning an attack is ""expected imminently."" Government officials from Washington to London insist that there are no known specific or credible terror threats tied to the Olympics. Travel to and around the United Kingdom will nevertheless be a focus of security efforts. Visitors arriving at London's Heathrow Airport can expect to see every desk at passport control manned during the Olympic Games, the home secretary has said. Immigration desks have extra staffers, Heathrow said Monday, amid fears of long lines to get into the country as security checks are carried out. Retired border officials and retired police officers are among those being brought in to supplement immigration staff, the Home Office said. A planned strike by some border staff has been called off, easing fears of long lines at passport control. U.S. officials may also be lending a hand at Heathrow. The UK Department for Transport said a small number of staff from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration would be based at certain British airports ""to act as an on-site liaison for the TSA."" The TSA staffers will not, however, be conducting security screening or inspections, the Department for Transport said. Meanwhile, London's public transport authorities have been warning commuters for weeks to avoid travel hotspots around the time of the Games -- but have not stressed any additional security risk. The city's transport network is not immune to terror threats, as the attacks of July 2005 showed. But visitors can seek reassurance in the fact that Britain's police and intelligence officials have been successful since then in foiling attacks on the capital. In the 2005 incident, three bombs were detonated on underground trains and one on a bus in the city. The blasts killed 52 people and wounded more than 770. London Mayor Boris Johnson told CNN's Becky Anderson that while the city's authorities are not complacent, he is confident in their ability to keep visitors safe. ""We do everything in our power to maximize security at the venues, and that's working well now -- the army, the military as well as G4S are providing very safe conditions on the site, plus there is a huge amount of work that nobody has seen involving the intelligence service,"" he said . ""That's something about an event like this -- you listen out for what may or may not be happening on the Internet, you try as hard as you possibly can to monitor the potential suspects."" Johnson said it is impossible to guard against all ""unknown unknowns,"" and that's why strong security is needed at venues. ""At no stage can you guarantee that someone won't do something moronic, stupid, violent and tragic; not just in London, but the whole of the UK is a potential target in this period,"" he said. But at the same time, he said, ""the intelligence is as reassuring as it could be under the circumstances. The threat level, as far as we are aware, has slightly come down in the last 12 months, but you can never be certain.""

"(CNN) -- If you had tried to visit Winslow Homer when he was alive, you would have been greeted by a warning sign proclaiming ""Snakes! Snakes! Mice!"" on the path to his studio on Prouts Neck, a peninsula in Scarborough, Maine. While Peter Paul Rubens entertained dignitaries at home in Antwerp, Belgium, and Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera were famous for welcoming Nelson Rockefeller, Leon Trotsky and other guests to their homes in Mexico City, Homer and other artists were considerably less accommodating. We can only wonder what the notoriously private Homer and Andrew Wyeth would say about their studios in Maine and Pennsylvania being opened to visitors for the first time this year. If you've been admiring your favorite painter's work in a museum, you've only been seeing part of the picture. For the full view, you must visit the artist's home and studio. There you'll see where and how he lived and worked; what she saw when she looked out her window. Whether carefully decorated or intentionally uncluttered, artists' homes and studios show us who they were at the core. ""Everything in her house reflects Frida's taste and personality,"" says Hilda Trujillo Soto, director of the Museo Frida Kahlo in Mexico City. ""It is like a piece of art, decorated entirely by Frida ... her personal universe."" Here are six destinations where you can explore the personal universes of several renowned artists. 6 spots for architecture lovers . Winslow Homer Studio, Maine . Homer's ""Snakes! Snakes! Mice!"" sign was the artist's way of scaring away the ""rusticators"" -- city folk who summered in this private enclave 12 miles south of Portland, Maine. Expect a warmer welcome when the Winslow Homer Studio opens to the public September 25 after a six-year restoration overseen by the Portland Museum of Art. Homer lived and worked at Prouts Neck from 1883 until his death in 1910, completing paintings such as ""Cannon Rock"" and ""The Gulf Stream."" He left his mark on the place in countless ways, including traces of graffiti on the walls and his signature scratched into the window glass. At the Portland Museum of Art, the companion exhibition ""Weatherbeaten: Winslow Homer and Maine"" (September 22-December 30) showcases Homer's paintings of the area. A Local Excursion Pass offers discounted admission to area attractions including scenic ferry cruises on Casco Bay Lines, the Portland Observatory and the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow House. 8 religious wonders in the United States . Andrew and N.C. Wyeth Homes and Studios, Pennsylvania . Like the quiet beauty of his paintings, Andrew Wyeth's studio in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, puts visitors in a meditative mood. The intensely private artist didn't share this space with many people, but after his death in 2009, his wife, Betsy James Wyeth, gave the simple white former schoolhouse building to the Brandywine River Museum. It opened for docent-led tours in July. Andrew Wyeth painted here from 1940 until 2008, and the tools of his trade remain much as he might have placed them: brushes, sketches, even the eggs and pigments he used to mix the tempera for paintings such as ""Roasted Chestnuts"" and ""Adam"" are now in the museum's collection. The studio of N.C. Wyeth, Andrew's father, has a different feeling. Built with earnings from his illustrations for the 1911 Scribner's edition of ""Treasure Island,"" N.C. Wyeth's studio is filled with props he used in his robust illustrations, including a birch bark canoe and a wooden horse on which models posed for Western pictures. The Brandywine Valley, which extends from southeastern Pennsylvania to Delaware, retains much of the rural character that so appealed to the Wyeths. White Clay Creek Reserve in Pennsylvania and Brandywine Creek State Park in Delaware are pretty places for nature walks, day-hikes, canoeing and horseback riding. Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio, New Mexico . It took more than 10 years for Georgia O'Keeffe to convince the local Catholic diocese to sell her a crumbling hacienda in Abiquiu, New Mexico, overlooking the Chama River Valley. Abiquiu's cottonwood trees inspired her, the fertile soil and abundant garden pleased her and the views captivated her. O'Keeffe finally prevailed in 1945 and, after a complete renovation supervised by her friend Maria Chabot, she moved to Abiquiu in 1949 and stayed until 1984. Located about 55 miles from Santa Fe, the Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio is managed by the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. Guided tours (reservations required) are conducted from March through November. Separately, her former home at Ghost Ranch, now an educational retreat center, offers tours of the vistas she painted. ""Georgia O'Keeffe and the Faraway: Nature and Image,"" through May 5, 2013, at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, features her paintings from Ghost Ranch. Find your own artistic inspiration on a scenic drive through New Mexico. Nearby areas of natural beauty and historic interest are the Puye Cliff Dwellings, Pecos National Historic Park, Bandelier National Monument (still recovering from fire and floods in 2011) and the Native American pueblos and villages throughout the state. CÃ©zanne and Monet homes and studios, France . Aix-en-Provence in southern France is Paul CÃ©zanne's town. Brimming with relaxed charm, it almost begs you to pick up a paintbrush -- and many visitors do. Most also visit CÃ©zanne's picture-perfect atelier. Built in 1901 and surrounded by leafy grounds, the sparsely furnished studio is where CÃ©zanne worked late in his life. Nearby are the CÃ©zanne family's Jas de Bouffan estate and the BibÃ©mus quarries, both of which feature in his paintings. (The men pictured in CÃ©zanne's ""Card Players"" series were workers on the estate.) The Aix-en-Provence Office of Tourism offers guided tours of the three sites and a map for self-guided CÃ©zanne tours of the city. Aix itself is a place to exhale, while wandering in the Old Town, beneath the arching trees of the Cours Mirabeau, or through one of the city's famed outdoor markets. Giverny in northern France belongs to Claude Monet. The ""father of Impressionism"" lived and worked there from 1883 to 1926, after spying the town from the door of a train as he traveled from Vernon to Gasny. His house, built in 1890, is spacious and prettily furnished. (When Monet was alive, it also would have been very noisy, with his eight children running around.) Among the highlights indoors is his collection of Japanese prints by masters such as Hokusai and Hiroshige. Outdoors, of course, are Monet's legendary gardens and the ponds dotted with water lilies and spanned by a Japanese bridge. Just 45 minutes by train from Paris, Giverny is a day-trip destination, but it's also a gateway to medieval Rouen with its magnificent cathedral and ties to Joan of Arc, and to other sites in Normandy, such as Omaha Beach and Mont Saint Michel. Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera Homes and Studios, Mexico . Frida Kahlo's singular vision is evident everywhere in Casa Azul, her home and studio in Mexico City's CoyoÃ¡can district. Born in the house in 1907, she lived there most of her life and died there in 1954. No place was more significant to her. ""Almost all of her paintings include an element, a corner or a piece of her house,"" says museum director Hilda Trujillo Soto. ""Even the plants she had in her house are painted in her paintings."" Kahlo's books and her collections of Mexican folk art and religious healing charms, or ex-votos, are cherished mementos of her life there. Kahlo was less attached to the San Ãngel home and studio her husband, Diego Rivera, commissioned architect Juan O'Gorman to design for them in 1931-32. Yet Rivera loved the place, and it is where he died in 1957. Its two Functionalist style buildings connected by an exterior catwalk were restored to their original design in the 1990s based on photos taken by Frida's father in 1932. They featured as a location in the 2002 film ""Frida."" (Casa Azul was recreated in a studio for the movie.) Today they comprise the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo. For an excursion from Mexico City, try one of Frida and Diego's favorites, a visit to the first century A.D. city of Teotihuacan. Rubens House, Belgium . Peter Paul Rubens was not your typical starving artist. Born into a well-connected family in 1577, at age 32 Rubens was named court painter to Archduke Albrecht who ruled much of modern-day Belgium at the time. His artistic style reflected optimism after a period of war and hardship, and his charismatic personality won him influential admirers and special privileges, such as permission to employ an unlimited number of assistants in his glorious 17th-century baroque home and studio in Antwerp. It is Rubens' work we see in masterpieces such as ""The Raising of the Cross"" in Antwerp's Cathedral of Our Lady, but he had help executing his vision. How else could he have made the 2,500-plus paintings attributed to him? The process becomes clear inside his atelier, the vast workspace where assistants painted sections of individual works following sketches and notes Rubens provided. Meanwhile, Rubens himself might have strolled along the gallery overlooking the atelier, probably accompanied by an illustrious client. Rubens' influence is everywhere in Antwerp. On the modern side, Antwerp is a fashion capital, a major world diamond center and a fantastic shopping city. Come 2013, it will also be home to the Red Star Line Museum, a maritime and immigration museum in the Het Eilandje revitalized harbor district.

"(CNN) -- It used to be safe to say that most of us don't go looking for crime on our vacations, but that's not true anymore. Crime fiction travel, a juicier version of the well-worn literary pilgrimage, is a popular way for people to see the world. ""A lot of people read crime fiction in advance of visiting a new city. Once there, I think it's natural to see how the real place aligns with the one on the page,"" says best-selling crime novelist Laura Lippman, whose main character Tess Monaghan is a reporter turned private investigator living and working in Baltimore. A sense of place is vital to creating realistic crime fiction, but writing about a place people know and can visit presents challenges, notes Lippman, a former Baltimore Sun reporter. ""If you want to write about a real place, you better get it right, or you'll hear about it,"" she says. When authors succeed, their books and characters can become forever linked with the locations in which the books are set. Here are five destinations whose local authors get it right. Grit on wry: A dinner with Elmore and Peter Leonard . Baltimore . Thanks to her Tess Monaghan series, including the Edgar Award-winning ""Charm City,"" Laura Lippman has become an ambassador for her home city of Baltimore. When the city hosted the annual Bouchercon World Mystery Convention in 2008, a self-guided tour of ""Laura Lippman's Baltimore"" was developed for fans who wanted to see the sights the way Tess sees them. One destination is the Fell's Point neighborhood where Tess lives, and even manages to detect crime while bedridden, ""Rear Window"" style, in 2011's ""The Girl in the Green Raincoat."" Other tours cover neighborhoods north and south of Baltimore's Washington Monument in downtown Baltimore and include local landmarks such as the Enoch Pratt Free Library, which Lippman mentions in most of her books. Among the qualities that endear Tess to fans are her unabashed love of food and her loyalty to her favorite neighborhood haunts. They include the Daily Grind and Kali's Mezze in Fell's Point, Lexington Market south of the Washington Monument and Matthew's Pizza, where Lippman recommends the crab pe. Author uncovers thrilling world of 'An American Spy' Brattleboro, Vermont . Mention Vermont and the mind fills with images of bucolic farms and snow-covered mountains. Crime novelist Archer Mayor, who also works as a death investigator for Vermont's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and as a detective for the Windham County (Vermont) Sheriff's Office, sees those things and others. His police detective protagonist Joe Gunther is more than likely to gaze out at the Connecticut River near Brattleboro and find a body floating on the surface, as was the case in Mayor's 2007 novel ""Chat."" Brattleboro, Joe Gunther's home turf, embraces its position as Vermont's fictional crime center and the entire state of Vermont embraces Archer Mayor. At 12 Vermont Welcome Centers, including Guilford on I-91 near Brattleboro and Williston North and South on I-89 between Montpelier and Burlington, a new lending library program lets visitors pick up a print or audio edition of an Archer Mayor novel to enjoy while they travel and to return when they're done. Lodging packages with an Archer Mayor/mystery fiction theme are available in Brattleboro, Burlington, North Bennington and Waterbury. The Brattleboro Literary Festival takes place in October. The past year has not been kind to Brattleboro. A fire severely damaged the historic Brooks House hotel and much of the town's Main Street, and rains from Hurricane Irene flooded the downtown area. But Vermont's natural beauty remains unblemished. Edinburgh, Scotland . Five years ago Ian Rankin retired his Edinburgh detective John Rebus when the fictional character reached mandatory retirement age for Scottish police. Yet after 20 years and 18 Rebus novels, Rankin and his hard-driving detective had become indelibly linked to Edinburgh. Since 2000, Rebustours has offered two-hour guided walking tours that start at Rebus' favorite pub, the Royal Oak, and incorporate readings from the Rebus novels plus mentions of other local writers, Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Lewis Stevenson among them. Ian Rankin has his own interactive Rebus' Edinburgh map at his website, and he recently updated his Ian Rankin's Edinburgh app, available on iTunes and Google Play. One reason for this flurry of activity is the hotly awaited return of his detective. ""Rebus: Standing in Another Man's Grave,"" a new Rebus novel, will be released in the United Kingdom in November and in the United States in January 2013. Rankin fans visiting Scotland in September should also take advantage of Doors Open Days, an annual program that offers access to buildings and sites not usually open to the public. The scheme inspired Rankin's 2008 stand-alone art heist novel ""Doors Open."" A TV adaptation of that novel, starring Stephen Fry, is in production. Gaborone, Botswana . Alexander McCall Smith helped devise the tours based on his No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency novels that have been run by Africa Insight since 2003. The novels, which feature Precious Ramotswe, a ""traditionally built"" woman of unspecified age, are so charming and gentle it might be surprising to learn that many of the characters and places mentioned in them are drawn directly from real life. Stops on the tour vary but typically include Mma Ramotswe's house on Zebra Drive (a private residence), her birthplace in the village of Mochudi, and a visit to the ""orphan farm"" where Mma Ramotswe meets Motholeli and Puso. (Mma and Rra are the formal terms of greeting and respect for women and men, respectively, in Botswana.) The full-day tours have changed over the years as more books have been written â the newest in the series, ""The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection"" was released in April â but the core tour stops come from the earlier books and a cup of Mma Ramotswe's favorite red bush tea is always on the itinerary. Half-day tours, walking tours and two-day tours that include a visit to the Mokolodi Nature Reserve also are available. Sweden . We can thank Sweden for the current popularity of crime fiction tours; the country is rife with them. Even the beautiful, tiny fishing village of FjÃ¤llbacka in the BohuslÃ¤n region of West Sweden, which typically sees its population drop to 1,000 individuals in the off-season, now receives a steady of flow of visitors who want to see the locations mentioned in Camilla LÃ¤ckberg's best-selling Erica Falck novels, starting with ""The Ice Princess."" Henning Mankell's Inspector Kurt Wallander is resentful about working in Ystad, a small city in the SkÃ¥ne region of southern Sweden that he considers a backwater. Yet visitors now flock to Ystad from all over the world for the ""In the Footsteps of Wallander"" self-guided tour. (You can follow the route by map or by app.) The tours feature locations from the books and from both the Swedish and British TV series based on them. (""Wallander Series III,"" starring Kenneth Branagh, will air on PBS ""Masterpiece Mystery"" in September with episodes based on ""An Event in Autumn,"" ""The Dogs of Riga"" and ""Before the Frost."") Not surprisingly perhaps, the most popular crime fiction tours in Sweden are the Stockholm tours based on the Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson. The Stockholm City Museum sells maps for self-guided Millennium Tours and conducts two-hour guided tours focusing largely on the residential SÃ¶dermalm neighborhood where fictional journalist Mikael Blomkvist works and where fictional computer hacker Lisbeth Salander lives. It hardly matters that Blomkvist and Salander don't ""work"" or ""live"" in a real sense; ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and its sequels made them real enough for travelers to want to visit them.

"(CNN) -- Iran has not requested to move any of its warships through the Suez Canal, an Egyptian official said Thursday. ""No Iranian warships sailed through the canal in the last two days and nothing is planned for the coming days either,"" said Ahmed El-Manakhly, the transit director of the Suez Canal Authority. ""In order for any warship to cross the canal, their government needs to send a request to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through their embassy in Cairo for approval and once approved, the warships can cross the canal. but for now, no official request has been submitted,"" he said. The development came a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said two Iranian warships were expected to pass through the Suez Canal Wednesday night on their way to Syria. ""This is a provocation that proves that the self-confidence and insolence of the Iranians is growing from day to day,"" he said. ""This happens after the Iranian president's visit to south Lebanon and his aggressive declarations there towards Israel."" The Israeli Defense Ministry said Israel was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies. On the report, oil prices spiked for a time on Wednesday. The Suez Canal serves as a key passageway for international trade, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go all the way around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day on the way to both Europe and North America. Iranian Navy officials have said the flotilla has embarked on a yearlong training mission that takes it to the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea and through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. During the mission, Iranian Navy cadets are due to be trained and prepared for defending the country's cargo ships and oil tankers. Iranian Navy Cmdr. Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari said cadets would be trained to protect ships and tankers now under threat of attack from Somali pirates, Fars said. Part of the mission was also to gather intelligence. Sayyari said the ships were in the region in ""pursuit of a powerful (military) presence in the high seas and to consolidate our friendly ties and declare our message of peace and friendship to the regional countries."" Liberman said Wednesday that Israel's allies should pay attention after the news of the Iranians plan to enter the Suez.. ""We expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the Iranian provocations, designed to deteriorate the situation in the area, and put the Iranians in their place,"" he said. Liberman's comments were not so much a threat but a wake-up call about a ""worrying development,"" said a senior government official who was not identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The official said Liberman was ""painting it as a challenge to the West."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamim Netanyahu's office offered no immediate comment. CNN's Kevin Flower, Saad Abedine and journalist Ken Sweet contributed to this report .","Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman says two Iranian warships are expected to pass through the Suez Canal .

"(CNN) -- Tom Carson of GQ probably put it best in his review of the return of ""Mad Men"" for its sixth season: . ""Every year, TV critics get all tingly when our early screeners of 'Mad Men's' premiere (episode) show up in the mail,"" he writes. Critics are weighing in on the new season which starts Sunday night. Well, weighing in as much as they can as creator Matthew Weiner has asked those who've been fortunate enough to view the premiere to not share certain details. Weiner's penchant for secrecy is just adding to the sense of expectation it seems. 'Mad Men' and the other 1960s . ""No showrunner in television history is as obsessed with secrecy as 'Mad Men's' Weiner,"" writes Andy Greenwald for Grantland. ""He protects even the smallest details of his Emmy-winning show like Dick Whitman guarding the skeletons of his past. Mo Ryan has written a piece about the secrets. ""There's no problem with the content of ""Mad Men,"" which I plan to write about each week this season,"" she said. ""What's making me glum is the draconian code of silence that surrounds the show."" Mad men, mad 'dos: What the late '60s really looked like . Weiner did share a few of the plot points with CNN's Jake Tapper. ""There is a sense that someone like Don and seeing the world through Don's eyes, who is now 40, is going to become out of touch,"" Weiner said. "" And it's really the story for all of the characters. They're all sort of moving towards some kind of hopefully reconciliation with who they are, but there's quite a fire to walk through."" 'Mad Men' creator: Criticism of Romney based on fact . So far the chatter from TV insiders seems positive. Time's James Poniewozik wrote ""it would be absurd to claim, on the basis of the first two hours, that the show is 'better' or 'worse' or even 'as good' as ever."" ""I liked the episode, a lot,"" he said. ""But I also liked, a lot, Mad Men's season 3, which until its office-Ocean's-Eleven finale turned off some fans with its slow pace and melancholy."" Even the smallest details are being anticipated. Seth Stevenson from Slate writes ""What will the clothes and hairstyles look like? Is it at last time for shaggy sideburns? Will bras get burned? Will lapels spread wider?"" Rolling Stone even has a ""Mad Men"" cheat sheet to get folks up to speed. The experts aren't the only ones excited. Fans are also eagerly awaiting more of the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce action. Twitter user JaiMe tweeted ""It's going to take A LOT of man to get me off of my #madmen crush.

Private detectives in modern-day Los Angeles, they're the stars of best-selling author Robert Crais' award-winning series of crime novels. Elvis and Joe have been busting bad guys and thrilling millions of readers since 1987's ""The Monkey's Raincoat."" The books are international bestsellers, published in 42 countries, and have developed a fervent following. In ""Taken,"" Crais's newest novel, his 15th featuring the daring duo, Elvis and Joe take on an especially bloodthirsty group of criminals called bajadores. They are bandits who prey on other bandits along the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing in drugs, murder and kidnapping. ""Taken"" is intense and fast-paced and reads like a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Though that's not surprising when you consider Crais began his career writing for television series like ""Hill Street Blues,"" ""Cagney & Lacey"" and ""Miami Vice."" CNN recently spoke to the author about his new book, his loyal fans and why he's refused to bring Elvis and Joe to the big screen. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series? Crais: I really strive to bring something new to each book. I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him. So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage. CNN: In ""Taken,"" the story jumps between several points of view and moves back and forth in time. How difficult was it to put together? Crais: It was like a crazy puzzle that kept changing. You should have seen my office. I have these huge black foam boards on the wall, and tacked to them, I have these white punch cards with my story ideas, scenes and notes. I kept juggling these cards and amending them, making little scrawls on them. Notions came to me, things changed, and I literally shuffled them around like a deck of cards, trying to bring them all into focus so the events were as exciting as I could make them. CNN: How do you start a novel? What comes first, an idea, an image, a scene? Crais: It could be any of the above, but it's usually an image, almost always driven by a character moment. In ""Taken,"" it was the notion of Krista Morales and her hunger to know more about her mother's experience that night in the desert. I just saw her. It was literally my first image in the book. I saw her staring out into the black desert sky with this open-eyed wonder, trying to see the path her mother took to get to this country. All I had was her face in the moonlight, staring out there, and I just knew whatever she's looking for, I want to find. That was the engine that really kicked off the rest of the book. CNN: ""Taken"" revolves around a kidnapping on the U.S.-Mexico border by bajadores. What prompted you to write about these bandits? Crais: I had heard about these atrocious mass graves uncovered in Mexico south of the border: 52 people in one grave, 87 people in another, 164 bodies at a ranch with multiple burial sites. If you watch the news at all, you know Mexico is pretty much defining itself now as a war between the government and the various drug cartels. South of the border is fairly well-patrolled by armed groups of thugs who work for the cartels, and those guys end up preying on civilians, policemen and government officials, but they also prey on each other. I found out most of the people who were found in those mass graves were immigrants who were headed North from as far away as Central America. They were trying to get to the U.S., and somewhere along the way, cartel bandits or ""bajadores"" would kidnap them, rob them, force them to call their families or employers or whoever and try to extort additional money out of them. When there was no more money to be had, they would just be murdered and buried in mass graves. The business was literally stealing people. The nature of this victim was very moving to me. When you consider that the victim is basically an innocent, penniless person who's just trying to find a way to make his or her life better was super appealing to me, and it seemed like the type of people that Elvis and Joe would sympathize with and risk their lives to try and save. CNN: While there's lots of action in your books, it seems like the friendship between Elvis and Joe is what keeps readers coming back. Crais: Sure. The books are about Elvis and Joe. The books are about their friendship and who they are as men and human beings. I think that's why the readership has grown the way it has and why readers keep coming back to them. There's a value to their friendship that I think people admire and envy and want in their own lives. I know I do, so I kind of attribute it to other people, too. I would love to have either Elvis or Joe, preferably both, as my friends. They're certainly interesting guys, and we can live vicariously through them for their adventures, but there's something beautiful about these two guys and about having someone so trustworthy and dependable in your life. It's very comforting, I think. CNN: Has the success of the series surpassed your expectations? Crais: I'm certainly thrilled by the reaction. Honestly, I never would have thought the characters would have become as popular as they have. In the beginning, my dream was simply to make a living at it. I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to earn a living, but it never occurred to me that the books would become bestsellers. I mean, I'm glad, but none of this was by design. I wrote these guys because they're guys I wanted to spend time with. Writing a book is a long and difficult process for me. I'm a slow writer, so I spend the year with Elvis Cole and Joe Pike in my head. I was thinking about this the other day. I wrote the first book in 1987. Literally every day since that time, Elvis and Joe have been in my head. They're always there. I started these guys because I like them. I still like spending time with them, and I think that's probably the reason the readers have embraced Elvis and Joe the way they have. Whenever there's a new book, they want to refresh that friendship. CNN: Despite many lucrative offers, you've never sold the screen rights to Elvis and Joe. Why is that? Crais: It's pretty simple. You know the old saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it? I'm concerned that if there's a film of Elvis and Joe, that somehow it will interfere with the collaboration I have with my readers. I'm the first to admit this is probably a knuckleheaded fear on my part, but I have it nevertheless. Books are a collaborative art. Elvis and Joe don't exist until someone picks up one of the books and reads it. In the act of reading, you and I collaborate, and Elvis and Joe come to life inside your head. What I've learned over time is that the Elvis and Joe you see and hear in your head, they are only yours. There might be however many hundreds of thousands of other people who've read ""Taken,"" and each and every one of them is going to have a unique Elvis and Joe. It's going to be a little bit different from everybody else's because we all bring our own stuff to this. I find that wonderful. To me, that is the great thing about books, and I guess part of me is a little scared that if I let Hollywood get involved, and even if there's a really good movie made, that somehow once you've seen the film, when you come back to the new book next year, that collaboration that you and I have is going to be a little bit different. Because then, the movie is going to have inserted itself. So I'm really jealous and guarded about that. I want your Elvis and Joe to be a product of yours and mine and nothing else.

"(CNN) -- Brent Larson and his bride, Ona, look like an ad for their Antigua resort, glowing, in love and sun-kissed in paradise. The picture doesn't tell the whole story. Larson, a CNN iReporter, said the resort had no record of the couple's reservation for the honeymoon suite, leaving them half-asleep in the lobby until the middle of the night. The private beach? Not so private, with wandering drug dealers who didn't take kindly to the U.S. Naval Academy graduate and his wife declining their products. ""The Antigua pics being quite different than the story was an accident,"" said Larson of Charlotte, North Carolina. ""I wish I had pics of the (possibly human) bone fragment (I found on the beach), the cop giving me a hard time when I reported it, the massive storm that flooded St. John's and stranded me there for three hours while my wife thought I'd been kidnapped for ransom, and on and on."" It might have been the vacation from hell, but it seems that any trip can be turned into a great tale with amazing pictures. Inspired by the true stories behind picture-perfect photos, we asked CNN's iReporters to share their dream vacation photos and the real stories behind them. Almost everyone had amazing and sometimes horrifying stories that the camera didn't catch. 10 budget friendly all-inclusive resorts . They didn't let illness ruin their trip . Donna Henderson, another iReporter, had hoped for lovely times with her mother during a three-week vacation through Iceland, Scotland, France, the Netherlands and Italy. Her aunt joined them for part of the trip. It didn't go as planned. Less than a week after they arrived, her mother got a cough that turned into a viral chest infection. A few days later, her aunt had a heart attack. Henderson started to feel sick the next day and visited a hospital emergency room just to make sure she was OK. The special night out she planned for her mother's birthday, including a dinner cruise down the Seine River? They didn't make it. Despite their illnesses, Henderson doesn't dwell on the negative aspects of the trip when she looks through her pictures. ""One of the best things for me was to spend about a week and a half with my aunt and get to know her from the perspective of an adult,"" wrote Henderson, an Ottawa, Canada resident, in an e-mail. ""The trip to the Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon (in Iceland) was amazing and worth the entire 13.5 hours it took us, as we did it as a day trip,"" she wrote. ""My mum, who was born in Scotland, had always wanted to see Fingal's Cave and was finally able to do so. That was good for her to see it and for me to be the one to take her."" Five beautiful bike trips . Attack of the killer sand flies . Adam Parker, an iReporter from Decatur, Georgia, loves to take pictures and was immediately drawn toward Barbuda, ""a little jewel of an island where we could have some scenic solitude"" for his honeymoon. The happy couple knew that they wouldn't have air conditioning, which wouldn't have been a problem if sand fly season hadn't started earlier than usual. ""My wife would like me to clarify that we didn't just itch a little from bugs,"" he added. ""We actually spent most nights getting to sleep with her on the couch and me in the other room because we fell asleep whenever we became too exhausted to stay awake."" The highlight of the trip? Visiting the island's only hospital in search of relief from the itching. ""The hospital was an old, barely staffed facility in which half of the equipment used was outdated and/or rusted,"" he wrote. ""She chose to take antihistamine in pill form as opposed to getting a shot because we couldn't help but question the sterility of the environment."" He said, ""Now almost exactly a year later the memory of the biting pests has faded for me, not so much for my wife, and we are left with pictures that would make it hard to believe that we were treated to anything less than paradise during our first week of marriage."" Time doesn't blur the memories . While photos usually gloss over the back story, they're great for calling up those cherished, if not picture-perfect, family memories. Seattle iReporter Jim McClure and his wife recently scanned a collection of family camping trip photos from 20 years ago to create photo books for their grown children, now 24 and 28. Looking through pictures of the Canadian and Colorado Rockies, the Badlands, the Oregon and Washington coasts and the San Juan Islands sparked many memories not documented in the collection. McClure can clearly remember his daughter, ""at age 5 sitting, arms folded and crying because she was having difficulty setting up her tent, or the moose that wouldn't let me out of the campground shower building for several minutes."" ""My son and daughter set up and slept in their own tents, starting at a very young age. Everyone pitched in, from gathering fire wood to preparing meals to cleaning up. We were lucky to see and experience many wonderful things. We all remember our meals, some of the best food (ever) cooked over the fire."" The photo books were a hit with his kids during a recent family celebration. ""They were completely surprised,"" he wrote. ""The day's celebrations basically stopped while they slowly flipped through the books."" McClure said he's also grateful that his 90-year-old father is dedicated to reviewing and scanning his collection of photos that date back to McClure's great-grandparents' days. ""Every image tells a story, some short -- some longer,"" he wrote. ""It's not uncommon for an e-mail trail to go on for weeks, becoming pages long, containing the discussions these images conjure up from the recipients."" The pictures offer some perspective . iReporter Jim Heston was taking a day trip to Dala, across the Yangon River in Myanmar, when the skies decided to open up. As Heston ducked into a small shelter along the river to stay dry, children began to play in the rain, and an amazing photo opportunity presented itself. ""In the tropics, the people deal with the rain as a minor inconvenience, and don't let it hinder their mobility,"" he wrote. ""From the vantage point of the shelter, I was able to snap off pictures of people coming and going through the intersection."" He added, ""I made it to one more vantage point, an open restaurant near the ferry drop-off. This was a very vibrant spot as people arriving from the Yangon side, were on their way home. They weren't concerned about being drenched as they were getting close to home."" One man's washout is another's photo opp. And the rest of the world just goes about its business.

"(CNN) -- A massive herd of caribou grazes the Arctic tundra. Sea birds fatten up on shellfish along the Chesapeake Bay before flying thousands of miles to winter in South America. A pod of orca glide past Pacific islands blanketed in fir and cedar as they hunt for salmon. Few sights are more awe-inspiring than mass movements ofÃÂ  animals instinctively traveling the path forged by the millions of their kind that came before them. Summer is prime time for wildlife viewing, the season when you'll catch birds and animals tending their young and storing up energy before their fall migrations to winter feeding and breeding grounds. Here are seven jaw-dropping places in the United States to spot amazing creatures as they prepare for journeys large and small. Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska . Isolated and vast, the 19 million acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is often called the last truly wild place in the United States. The coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea, the heart of the refuge, offers spectacular wildlife viewing. In early summer, the 123,000-strong Porcupine caribou return here to give birth and graze the tundra. You might also spot grizzly bears, wolves, muskoxen and even polar bears, as well as huge populations of migratory birds. Most of the refuge is only accessible by plane. Unless you have extensive wilderness experience, it's best to hire a qualified guide for both day hikes and longer expeditions. You can find more information on authorized guides online. Best affordable beach resorts . San Juan Islands, Washington . Between the Washington mainland and Vancouver Island lies the San Juan Archipelago, a chain of 178 islands. From late spring through the summer, orca sightings are very common here: three extended family pods regularly pass through, following salmon migrations. Although boats are required by law to keep a 200-yard distance from the spouting giants, curious orcas will sometimes come very close. Whether you opt for a kayak trip or a larger boat tour, you'll want to select a tour operator that respects the orca's habitat. The Whale Museum, a local educational and research institution, recommends booking with tour companies that are members of the Pacific Whale Watching Association. Even if you don't spot an orca during your trip, you're likely to see a variety of marine life, including sea lions, harbor seals, porpoise and perhaps even gray whales. Plan a visit to the San Juan Island National Historical Park, where you can hike through cedar forests, native prairie and along rocky shorelines while enjoying marvelous views of the Olympic Mountains and the Northern Cascades. America's best North-South roads . Glacier National Park, Montana . With more than 1 million acres of glaciers, forests, lakes, mountains and wetlands, visitors to Glacier National Park have the chance to see everything from elusive wolves, grizzlies and mountain lions to the more common mountain goats, bighorn sheep, elk and moose. Most animals in the park have relatively modest migration ranges, moving between higher and lower elevations depending on the season. Elk congregate in valleys to give birth, then head into the mountains to keep cool and to feed. During summer, bighorn sheep can also be spotted on high mountain slopes, often around rocky outcroppings where they perform the seemingly death-defying feats of scrambling along ledges and cliffs. Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming . It goes without saying that Yellowstone offers some of the most impressive wildlife encounters anywhere, but there's something unique about bison, the park's largest mammal. According to the National Park Service, Yellowstone is the only place in the United States where bison have lived continuously since prehistoric times. There are two main bison herds in Yellowstone that migrate within the park. Roadside bison sightings are common in summer. As with other large animals in the park, they'll sometimes cross the road directly in front of cars, so drivers should take great care. 10 best motorcycle roads in the U.S. Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico . On summer evenings, tourists gather in an outdoor amphitheater at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in southeastern New Mexico to witness an awesome spectacle: hundreds of thousands of Brazilian (also known as Mexican) free-tailed bats taking flight en masse at dusk to hunt insects. The best opportunities to see the bats are in July and August, before they head to Mexico for the winter. If you're really ambitious, arrive before dawn and catch them swooping and diving hundreds of feet as they re-enter their cave after the nocturnal hunt. A full day leaves ample time to tour the caverns before watching an evening flight. Nesting sea turtles, Florida . Florida's coastlines are crucial to the survival of several species of threatened and endangered sea turtles, including the loggerhead, leatherback and green turtle. From May through July, female turtles swim onto beaches to dig deep holes, deposit their eggs and cover them before returning to the water. About two months later, it will be up to the tiny babies to crawl out and hurry toward the ocean. Secret hotels of Florida's Gulf Coast . Coastal counties, state parks and wildlife refuges offer organized turtle walks to help ensure visitors don't inadvertently harm the fragile creatures. You can learn more about turtle walks by contacting the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, a 20.5-mile stretch of coastline between Melbourne Beach and Wabasso Beach on Florida's southeast coast. Staff can also help identify other places to witness this incredible event. You can help protect turtles by avoiding -- and keeping dogs away from -- areas where the turtles nest unless you're on a guided walk. Don't dig in the sand, and avoid using flashlights, flash cameras or other electronic devices. Baby turtles instinctively move toward natural light reflecting off the water and may become disoriented by artificial light. Assateague and Chincoteague Islands . Cute ponies might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think about wildlife, but on Assateague and Chincoteague, barrier islands off the coast of Virginia and Maryland, the descendants of ponies brought by colonists in the 1600s roam freely through salt marshes, pine forests and windswept beaches. Wild ponies are far from the only reason to visit. Assateague National Seashore and the neighboring Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge are a birder's paradise because of their location along the Atlantic Flyway, a major migratory bird flight path. Hiking, boating and kayaking are great ways to bird-watch here. Keep your eyes peeled for deer, foxes, opossum, otters, whales and dolphins, too. Animal attacks: A note of caution . Before you venture out into the wilderness, do your research and know the risks. Though rare, wild animal attacks can and do happen, and different animals require different responses to protect yourself. For your own well-being and that of the wildlife you encounter, always maintain a safe distance -- no matter how cute or cuddly they may seem. Photos: Escape to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula .

"(CNN) -- Why stay home when there are 195 or 196 (depending on whom you ask) countries out there with so much to show off? Granted, spending January in the middle of Moscow won't do your poor circulation much good, and July in New Delhi requires industrial-strength antiperspirant. But for each month there's a perfect city, and conversely each city can be best enjoyed in a specific month. Here's a yearlong guide to the when, where and why: . January: Tromso or Kirkenes, Norway . Why: The chance to shorten your bucket list: specifically, to mark off the northern lights. Although the aurora borealis can be spotted anywhere between latitudes 65 and 72 degrees, Norwegian towns such as Kirkenes, Tromso, Alta and Svalbard offer ringside seats, especially in the winter. Sail Norway's fiord-lined coasts aboard a Hurtigruten cruise ship, and the crew will provide wake-up calls when viewing is best. If snowmobiling and dog sledding under shimmery green curtains of solar particles colliding with atmospheric gases aren't on your bucket list, you just need better gloves. Weather report: To quote Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, ""There's no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing."" Who should avoid: Anyone dead set on maintaining a year-round suntan. 7 stunning European ski lodges . February: Rio de Janeiro . Why: If you thought the Brazilians' costumes were crazy during the Olympics, wait until you see them at Carnival in Rio. Millions jam the streets for exuberant samba dancing, drumming and wild displays of joy. Christ the Redeemer, the world's largest art-deco statue, watches over it all from Corcovado Mountain. You don't have to be tall or tan or young or lovely to enjoy Ipanema and Rio's other famous beaches. But you do need a bikini, the skimpier the better. (Bottom half only for guys.) Weather report: Sunny and hot (average 32 degrees Celsius/90 degrees Fahrenheit), perfect for the beach and revealing outfits. Who should avoid: Prudes who believe women should stick to turtlenecks. Lonely Planet's top U.S. destinations for 2013 . March: New Zealand . Why: Art, food, weather ... in addition to the year-round views. Although you'll want to spend time in the forward-thinking Kiwi city of Auckland -- maybe taking in the 2013 Auckland Arts Festival (March 6-24) -- this is the perfect month to get out in the country, where adorable lambs are everywhere, magically bounding from one beautiful hillside to another. It's still warm enough for a day at the beach, yet fall colors are starting to erupt. Plus, where else can you take in a food festival that celebrates foraged food? The Hokitika Wildfoods Festival (March 9) offers such delicacies as huhu grubs, sheep brains, gorse flower wine and wasp larvae ice cream. Weather report: Gorgeous, crisp days with averages in the low 20s C/low 70s F. Who should avoid: Squeamish eaters. Gollum and Sauron. April: Phuket, Thailand . Why: Get a jump on your tan. When deciding on which of Phuket's sandy beaches to put down your blanket, start at the Big Buddha, a 45-meter (148-foot) white jade icon with 360-degree views of Thailand's biggest island and the Andaman Sea. Just know that arguments are fierce as to which beach is best -- there's one for every taste from hard-to-find Banana Beach to upscale resorts such as the Amanpuri. Weather report: Monsoons don't start until next month, so slather on the sunscreen and get comfortable. Who should avoid: The fun-averse. May: Tokyo . Why: Cherry blossom photos minus other tourists' backs and heads. During May's Golden Week, when everybody flees the city, Japan's capital is as empty as you'll ever find it. The city's 160,000-odd restaurants are practically empty (relatively speaking), and you might even get a bid in at one of 1,000 stalls in Tsukiji Central Fish Market. Carp streamers known as koinobori are flying, the mountains are a lush green and, by the time everyone returns to the city, you'll be going the other direction -- to the countryside or Kyoto or Hokkaido, where the cherry blossoms and accompanying hanami parties are just starting to bloom. Weather report: With summer's crippling humidity still a month or so away, gardens and blossoms are at their height and temperatures in the low 20s C/low 70s F. Who should avoid: Travelers who enjoy being lost in crowds. June: Seoul, South Korea . Why: To perfect your golf swing. Ever since 2009, when Y.E. Yang came from behind to knock out Tiger Woods in the Hazeltine PGA Championship, becoming the first male Asian to win a major (the women have been winning championships since 1998), golfing in South Korea has taken off like a bottle rocket. With the President's Cup to be hosted here in 2015 and lots of new, upscale private clubs opening -- many that resemble modern art museums -- South Korea is becoming a legit golf destination. Weather report: Mild temperatures and lots of camellias and azaleas. Who should avoid: Cheapskates. South Korea's fancy new golf courses require large membership fees. July: Tanzania and Kenya . Why: To experience the Great Migration, when thousands of wildebeest and zebras move across the sun-dried landscape of the Serengeti. In July, you can ditch the crowds in the pristine, rarely visited northern Serengeti and more popular Masai Mara Game Reserve. Weather report: Dry with pleasant temps, average high of 28 C/82 F. Who should avoid: City dwellers who hate the outdoors and/or camping. August: Quebec City, Quebec . Why: While it's roasting in the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, this 400-year-old city with cobblestone streets, eclectic cafe culture and nonstop entertainment rings in with perfect temps. A lot of freebie entertainment is available, from Cirque du Soleil shows (tickets in other cities go for $100-plus) to fireworks over the St. Lawrence River to the world's largest movie screen. Weather report: Mostly sunny with an average 25 C/77 F. Who should avoid: Tightwads who dislike tipping -- street performers on every corner pass hats. September: Cape Town, South Africa . Why: It's naturally beautiful throughout the year, but Cape Town is in prime spring form with flowers sprouting everywhere. But because it's technically off-season, air fare and hotel bargains are available for bargain hunters. Offshore you'll find magnificent right whales in the process of making more magnificent right whales. Weather report: Temps pleasant with cool evenings. Who should avoid: Claritin addicts. October: Munich, Germany . Why: The ultimate party (6 million takers per year) is in full swing. Despite its many imitators, the original Bavarian Oktoberfest, where beer isn't classified as alcohol but as a ""health drink,"" is hard to top. It's so popular no one wants to wait till October to start; the 2013 event runs from September 21 to October 6. Men wear lederhosen, women sport boob-accentuating dirndls, oompah bands play and everyone is singing, albeit somewhat poorly. While you might imagine that playing a prost song every seven minutes (that's the average toasting interval) could lead to a fast descent into chaos, Germans value rules and order, and even when tents are canvas-wall-to-canvas-wall, civility prevails. For those hoping to finance the rest of their year of travel, take note that Oktoberfest workers can earn $19,000 in 16 days. Crucial tip: Make a table reservation six months to a year ahead of time -- those who just show up to the party will not be able to find a seat inside any of the tents and won't be served. Weather report: Temperatures are crisp and cool (about 16 C/60 F), and Bavaria's mountains are in their full autumn glory. Who should avoid: Enochlophobics. November: Sydney, Australia . Why: With more than 50 beaches (that's just those in the city limits) and 300 days of sunshine, there's no such thing as a bad time to visit this city. But in November, before summer air fares kick in, reasonable flights and hotel rooms can be scored. And even though the Melbourne Cup is run hundreds of miles to the south (on November 5), the thoroughbred horse race incites a countrywide party. Weather report: Beach weather (mid-20s C/mid-70s F) without the crowds. Who should avoid: People without sunscreen. December: London . Why: Charles Dickens. No sooner did sweaty Olympic bodies pack up their medals and go home than London began unpacking its impressive holiday decorations. The sweet-spirited Cratchits left a legacy that England's capital doesn't take lightly. From the giant Norwegian spruce (given to London by Norway each year) at Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland to Harrods, Fortnum & Mason's and other department stores' extravagant, light-strewn windows, 'tis definitely the season to be jolly. Carolers, light displays, ice skating and choirs at Westminster Abbey make this the quintessential place to celebrate Christmas. Not to mention that massive bargains and sales take center stage right after Boxing Day. Weather report: Cold, wet days are perfect for sipping mulled wine in front of cozy, wood-burning fireplaces. Who should avoid: Anyone who uses words like ""bah"" and ""humbug.""","See the northern lights in Norway in January, then head to Rio for Carnival .
Check out the cherry blossoms in Tokyo in May and skip over to South Korea for golfing .
In December, soak up the holiday spirit in London ."
"(CNN) -- Spread across nearly 3,500 square miles and home to some 60 animal species and almost half of the world's geysers, visitors could explore Yellowstone National Park for weeks and not see everything in the country's first national park.

"(CNN) -- After a harsh winter for much of the United States, you're probably more than ready for spring. And if you're looking for a way to welcome the season of flowers, the National Cherry Blossom Festival is a good place to start. The annual Washington festival started Wednesday, the first day of spring, and runs through April 14. The peak bloom time for the cherry trees is expected in early April. Arabella Bowen, executive editorial director for Fodor's Travel, recommends these seven ways to experience the more than 3,000 cherry trees in bloom: . Arrival of spring deserves its own parade . The National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade runs along Constitution Avenue (from 7th to 17th streets N.W.) from 10 a.m. to noon April 13. The parade will feature celebrity performances, giant helium balloons, colorful floats and marching bands from across the country. Grandstand seating can be purchased for $20, and there is no cost for viewing along the parade route. Celebrate the culture of Japan . Also on April 13, Sakura Matsuri, a Japanese street festival, runs nearly a mile through downtown Washington and features traditional and Japanese pop musical performances, an arts and culture section, martial arts demonstrations and Japanese products, plus more than two dozen food vendors and two Kirin Ichiban beer gardens. These events make a nice addition to a day spent enjoying the blossoming trees, which were a gift from Tokyo more than 100 years ago. Cruise the blooms . Relax and tour the cherry blossoms by boat on the Potomac River. Enjoy a lunch cruise for $57 or a dinner cruise for $107 with Spirit Cruises, or just go for a 45-minute sightseeing cruise on the Capital Elite yacht for $26. Capture the perfect shot . Take your best shot with a cherry blossom photo safari. Washington Photo Safari offers sunrise and afternoon tours at the Tidal Basin for $69. The sunrise tours meet at 6:15 a.m., but ""remember that great art is only produced through suffering,"" the company's website says. Washington Photo Safari also offers a photo excursion that includes a boat tour along the Washington Channel into the Potomac River for $89. Stroll under the blossoms . Take a walking tour of your own around the Tidal Basin as signs along the way highlight facts and history of the trees. Use the Tidal Basin Cherry Tree Location Map as a guide, with names and descriptions of the tree types. Fly a kite . The Blossom Kite Festival, from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. March 30 on the Washington Monument grounds, showcases kite ballets and demonstrations by pros, but it also gives kids and families a chance to build and fly their own kites. Check out the Hot Tricks Showdown and the Rokkaku Battle on the competition field or learn to fly your own kite at noon on the family field. Cherry-pick a hotel that's also in bloom . Many hotel operators have blossom-themed packages. Kimpton Hotels' ""Blossoms & Bubbles"" package offers blossom-inspired perks such as handcrafted cherry blossom soap, a $30 credit per day for dining or parking, and bubbles at check-in for kids. Plus, guests can sip complimentary sake at the evening wine hour from 5 to 6 p.m. The package is available at Kimpton's 11 Washington and northern Virginia hotels. Starting rates range from $135 to $185 per night. Washington's Willard InterContinental is known for its live cherry blossom display during the festival. The Willard's Very Cherry Blossom Package for two is available through April 14, and includes valet parking, breakfast for two and two Old Town Trolley tour tickets. The package price per room starts at $409 per night, based upon availability.","Washington's National Cherry Blossom Festival runs through April 14 .

"(CNN) -- It's a cautionary tale: Capping off a 50-day bender with a transcontinental flight may cause confusion. A Ukrainian man returning from a trip during which he ""got drunk and stayed drunk for the entire 50 days,"" according to court papers, faces federal charges after attempting to open an emergency exit moments after his flight landed. Details of the commotion are contained in a federal complaint filed by the U.S. attorney in Utah. The complaint says that as the plane was descending, Anatoliy N. Baranovich, 46, woke and started yelling in Russian that the wing of the aircraft was on fire. Passengers wrestled Baranovich when he tried to open the emergency exit shortly after landing, documents say. Later, Baranovich told investigators through an interpreter that he thought the plane's wing was on fire and was close to scraping the ground. The incident occurred Monday night aboard Delta Flight 1215 -- a Boeing 757 -- traveling from Boston to Salt Lake City. Baranovich lives in Portland, Oregon, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Read the FBI complaint against Baranovich (PDF) Baranovich's rough homecoming came after a trip to visit family in Ukraine, where he was planning to start building a house. But those building plans fell through. According to the complaint, he also ""stated that he got drunk and stayed drunk for the entire 50 days"" of his visit. The drinking continued while traveling back to the United States, but Baranovich ""could not specify when, how much or where he consumed the alcohol."" When the 757 touched down, Baranovich jumped out of his seat and ran to the back of the aircraft, where he tried to open an emergency exit, according to the complaint. A flight attendant ordered Baranovich to stop, but he continued to open the door, breaking the door and an inflatable slide and damaging the fuselage, the court papers say. Several passengers jumped out of their seats, pinning Baranovich against a galley wall, the complaint says. He attempted to open the exit on the other side of the plane, stopping only when a former police officer forced him to the floor. The ex-cop searched Baranovich's fanny pack, finding his Ukraine passport and U.S. visa. Baranovich faces charges of damaging and disabling an aircraft and interference with a flight crew. Each charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. ""We do not believe there is a connection to terrorism,"" FBI spokeswoman Deborah Bertram said. Baranovich appeared in court Wednesday and was assigned counsel. He remained in custody Wednesday. Delta Air Lines is in contact with other passengers, a spokesman said. ""We continue to cooperate with the FBI, which is leading the followup."" Grape expectations: Making wine taste good at 35,000 feet .

"(CNN) -- Leza Dabit spent more than $2,000 recently to attend a friend's wedding in Jamaica with her boyfriend. The weekend before, she was in Columbus, Georgia, celebrating nuptials, and the weekend after was spent feting another couple's marriage on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. And Dabit is just getting started. She's got four more weddings to go before mid-December. Dabit, a business development manager for an IT staffing company in Atlanta, receives only 10 days of vacation. Weddings are lovely, one of the few occasions when people still get dressed up, tuck their gadgets away and observe longstanding traditions. But my, can traveling to a wedding get expensive. And the preceding engagement, bachelor and bachelorette parties and showers will slash into your savings too, should you choose to run that gantlet. The ensuing baby showers and family reunions may lump on another travel expense for our increasingly mobile society. These obligations are eating up vacation days and discretionary (and not-so discretionary) income, but it's often nearly impossible to say no. And there are very good, fabric-of-our-society reasons for that. Still, what is a mere mortal to do in the face of seven weddings? ""All my extra money goes to this,"" said Dabit, 30. ""Every weekend is a blast, don't get me wrong."" Photos: Celebrity wedding sites . She's already hit a bachelorette weekend in Nashville and plans on a beach getaway for another bride in Florida, but she ran out of vacation days and can't go on a cruise with another close friend and bride-to-be. Next year doesn't look nearly as busy for Dabit on the event front, and she won't be taking her weekends for granted. ""I think I'm going to take a trip for me next year."" Her situation is not unusual. Forty-one percent of U.S. adults use the majority of their vacation budgets on obligation trips such as weddings, holiday gatherings and reunions, according to a July Hotwire survey. The average cost to attend a wedding as a guest is $339 this year, down from $490 a year ago, according to the American Express Spending and Saving Tracker. If you're in the wedding, the average cost this year is $377, down from $539 in 2011. A far-flung destination wedding can easily set you back double that amount. Dabit has politely declined invitations before, just sending a gift, but all seven of this year's events are weddings she wouldn't want to miss. Lasting connections: Love at the airport . Sociologist Jeffrey Alexander sees spending freely to celebrate big milestones as evidence of what people value. ""On the one hand, doing these rituals is a way of showing that you're not a materialistic person and that you value your close friendships,"" said Alexander, a sociology professor and founder and co-director of the Center for Cultural Sociology at Yale University. ""At the same time, we do live in the economic world."" Weighing finances is prudent, but so is weighing your relationships. Turning someone down for a life-changing event can be damaging. ""I think that is a kind of test,"" Alexander said. ""If you invite somebody and they don't come, then they're not willing to put their money where their mouth is. They're not showing that they actually care about you."" But caring for a friend to the tune of $1,000 can be a tall order. Brittany Winfeld, 27, was faced with a choice: spend nearly $1,000 on a close friend's bachelorette weekend in Miami or pay for her medical board exams. ""For me, my career is more important than a weekend getaway,"" said the medical resident who lives in New York. ""The most important thing for me is to attend the main event: the wedding."" And attend, she will. She's going to five in the next year: one in the Caribbean, one in Florida, one in Massachusetts and two close to home in the New York area. Make or break? Travel tests your love life . She estimates that she and her husband will spend $4,000 on the Caribbean getaway alone, which they plan to turn into a vacation since they will already have traveled more than a thousand miles from home. Winfeld has a few weeks left in her residency before starting a fellowship. Her husband is also a resident, and the couple is shouldering hefty student loans. ""It's a definite financial burden to me and to him,"" she said. But she feels like she can't say no to these events, and the stretch is worth it for their really good friends. ""These people were there for me for my wedding, and I would feel terrible saying no, because they were there for me,"" Winfeld said. And the budget? ""We kind of threw that out the window."" There are right ways to say no, says Anna Post, co-author of the 18th edition of ""Emily Post's Etiquette"" and great-great granddaughter of the grande dame of gracious behavior. ""If you know right now, in the middle of June, that you are not going to go ... however you come to your choice, once you make it, make it early and tell people right away,"" Post advised. ""It doesn't count when it comes to etiquette if you didn't tell anybody."" You don't have to share a reason, but if you do, be honest about it. It's no good saying you can't afford a destination event and then heading to Italy two weeks later. In that case, say that you've made other vacation plans or that you've committed to something else, Post says. Don't say yes and reverse your decision later. It's better to thank someone for an invitation and wait to reply when you're sure. Post did say that turning someone down for a major milestone ""can be very statement-making."" She calls weddings, christenings, funerals and other important moments ""precedent-setting events."" ""It's much easier to carry on a relationship with someone, even if it's a rough relationship, if you participate in the big events,"" Post said. Joining friends and family hasn't always been such a big production. The crossing of states and continents to be part of social rituals has picked up over the past 30 years as more people earn college degrees and participate in a national labor market, according to Alexander. More Americans leave home, go to college and never look back, so friends and family are scattered. Saying no to traveling across the country for special occasions seems to be getting harder. People used to accept the idea that an event might just be too far away, Alexander says. ""Now there's an expectation that there's no excuse,"" especially within the continental United States. Cheaper and more accessible air travel, more affordable telephone service and the emergence of virtual communication have all given rise to people coming together more readily from long distances to mark milestones with their peers, Alexander says. People ages 18 to 30 are especially likely to ignore the barriers of physical distance, because they're used to the virtual closeness of daily communication with their friends on social media. And the most important ties are sustained through rituals. ""It's kind of the opposite of the uncertainty that we all have in our society. I mean, we're all uncertain about our jobs, about our children, about success, about relationships -- whether we're married or not,"" Alexander said. ""Ritual is reassuring and connecting."" Connecting or not, there's still nothing that says you have to attend. ""Anybody that feels they have to succumb to social pressure, whatever it is ... they need to realize the importance of listening to your inner self and developing your inner self,"" said Amitai Etzioni, a sociologist and director of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies at the George Washington University. ""It's not automatic that the community has the right of way."" Part of what complicates matters and creates that to-go-or-not-to-go tension is the fact that the social norms that existed before the sexual revolution and the civil rights movement were upended in the late '60s. Since then, everyone's been coming up with their own rules and trying to create unique, distinctive events to celebrate their lives, says Etzioni, who edited the book ""We Are What We Celebrate: Understanding Holidays and Rituals."" Weddings used to be ""a ceremony, a reception, dinner."" Now, some are three-day events. So many situations today require deliberation and negotiation and often lead to misunderstanding. ""In the olden days, if you went on a date, there was no question, the boy paid. Now, it's complicated,"" Etzioni said. ""Nothing is etched in stone anymore."" How important are rituals to you? How much are you willing to spend to participate? Share your stories below.","Traveling for weddings and other social occasions can strain bank accounts .

"(CNN) -- Hotels love to push the aura of movie-star glamor as part of their mystique, listing on their websites Hollywood royalty that have stayed in -- and sometimes trashed -- their rooms. At times, though, the hotels play a leading role, providing memorable settings that are characters unto themselves. Oscar's tour of the world . Naturally, California has many such hotels, but movie star hotels are scattered all over the world. In honor of Oscar season, here are a handful of hotels that make for award winning, star-kissed vacations. ""Some Like It Hot"" Hotel del Coronado, San Diego . One of America's most beloved comedies, 1959's zany ""Some Like It Hot,"" starring Marilyn Monroe and drag-bedecked Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, used the Hotel del Coronado as a main location. Set in 1929, the comedy's plot centers around two musicians escaping from the mob by dressing up as women to join an all-female band. The film was nominated for several Oscars, but didn't get a nomination for best picture. The hotel turns 125 this year, and completed an $8 million renovation in 2012. Over its long history, the Victorian hotel, noted for its wraparound porches (highlighted in the film where rows of men wait to watch for Monroe's character, Sugar, to return to the hotel), has been the site of many films, including 1915's ""Pearl of the Pacific"" and 1924's ""My Husband's Wives."" 8 getaways we wish we could afford . ""The Shining"" Timberline Lodge, Oregon . Stanley Hotel, Estes Park, Colorado . The Timberline Lodge was used as the exterior of the Overlook Hotel for the 1980 Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick movie ""The Shining,"" starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. The plot centers on a couple and their son, the hotel's winter caretakers. It turns out the hotel is haunted, driving the father (Nicholson's character, Jack Torrance) insane. Many of the outdoor scenes were shot at the Timberline, a ski resort in the shadows of Mount Hood. Creepy indoor scenes, including endless hallways, along with the hedge maze scene, were sets created in the United Kingdom at Elstree Studios. The movie is based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, inspired by King's stay at Colorado's Stanley Hotel. The hotel, just outside Rocky Mountain National Park in Estes Park, is considered haunted and is routinely surveyed for paranormal activity. The hotel was used in 1994's ""Dumb and Dumber"" and called Hotel Danbury. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" Hotel Alfonso XIII, Seville, Spain . Several scenes from ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" the 1962 British film about T.E. Lawrence's World War I exploits, starring Peter O'Toole, were filmed at this 1929 Moorish style Seville property. 2012 marked the 50th anniversary of the film, which was released in a digitally remastered version. The hotel went through a similar renewal, with a $25 million renovation completed in 2012 that included a new restaurant, bar and guest rooms. The decor in the hotel's rooms captures different eras of Spain's past with Andalusian, Castilian and Moorish elements. 'Downton' in America: 6 big estates . ""Argo"" The Beverly Hilton, Beverly Hills, California . This midcentury Beverly Hills classic was opened in 1955 by Conrad Hilton, great grandfather to blond socialite Paris Hilton. The Aqua Star Pool, the largest heated pool in Beverly Hills, is surrounded by cabana guest rooms for easy access to the Southern California sunshine. Some of the hotel's pool level area, where restaurants Circa 55 and Trader Vic's Lounge are located, have retained the original 1950s ""Mad Men""-style color schemes. The hotel's eighth-floor Stardust Room was featured in ""Argo,"" the Iran hostage drama that won this year's Oscar for best picture. Ben Affleck's character, Tony Mendez (based on a real CIA operative), heads to the hotel to mingle with Hollywood's elite as part of a farfetched rescue scheme for American hostages. The hotel has hosted the Golden Globe Awards for 35 consecutive years . ""Pretty Woman"" Beverly Wilshire, Beverly Hills, California . Another Beverly Hills hotel featured in movies is the Beverly Wilshire, just around the corner from Rodeo Drive. The 1928 Italian Renaissance style hotel, now part of the Four Seasons, has a big role in 1990's ""Pretty Woman,"" starring Richard Gere as a ruthless businessman and Julia Roberts as a prostitute who softens his heart. Roberts' scantily clad character is frowned upon by hotel staff, but eventually wins them over with her personality and wardrobe transformation. The hotel is so associated with the film that many Los Angelenos simply point it out as the ""Pretty Woman"" hotel. The nearly 400-room hotel includes 137 luxury suites and a Mediterranean-style pool with cabana packages starting at $180. ""Lost in Translation"" Park Hyatt Tokyo, Tokyo . ""Lost in Translation,"" a 2003 movie starring Bill Murray as a fading actor and Scarlett Johansson as a lonely young American newlywed whose husband is busy working, uses the Park Hyatt Tokyo to tremendous effect. Occupying the top 14 floors of the Shinjuku Park Tower, the sleek Park Hyatt Tokyo boasts commanding views and was a hotel of choice for director Sofia Coppola before the film. The vast, chaotic neon-lit view from the serene hotel emphasizes the loneliness of both main characters. ""Ten years have passed since the film's release, yet it continues to be a catalyst for people to discover both Park Hyatt Tokyo and the city of Tokyo,"" said Philippe Roux-Dessarps, Park Hyatt Tokyo's general manager. ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" Round Hill Hotel and Villas, Montego Bay, Jamaica . Get your groove back at the Round Hill Hotel and Villas, set on a lush 100-acre peninsula in Montego Bay, Jamaica. The hotel was the setting for 1998's ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back,"" starring Angela Bassett as workaholic divorcee Stella Payne, Taye Diggs as much-younger love interest Winston Shakespeare and Whoopi Goldberg as sidekick Delilah Abraham. The movie uses the hotel's rooms and views beautifully, with vistas of the verdant landscape and beach. The resort has 36 Ralph Lauren-designed rooms in its main building, called the Pineapple House, along with 27 private villas, the type of room Stella stayed in. Other highlights are an open-air dining terrace, a double infinity pool, five all-weather tennis courts and a spa housed in a restored 18th century plantation house. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" Hotel Palacio, Estoril, Portugal . Plenty of hotels have been used as James Bond locations, yet few are said to have helped inspire the character. The 1930 Hotel Palacio reportedly did just that for author Ian Fleming. As a neutral country during World War II, Portugal played host to spies, deposed royalty, black marketers and many others who came to stay at the hotel and play in the casino on the Estoril Coast outside Lisbon. As a British Naval Intelligence officer, young Fleming rubbed elbows with some of those colorful characters at the hotel. While many remember dramatic Swiss Alps ski scenes with machine guns setting off avalanches, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" opens on the beaches of Portugal, with James Bond staying at the Hotel Palacio overlooking the Bay of Cascais. To this day, the hotel's bar is renowned for its very strong martinis, which you can order shaken, stirred or however you like.","San Diego's Hotel del Coronado served as a backdrop in 1959's ""Some Like It Hot""

"(CNN) -- Music conductor Caroline Carson loves the sound of fighter jets. Rushing to the window of her office at the University of New Orleans, where she directs the choral studies program, she saw the Blue Angels in the air practicing for an upcoming show. Searching online later for more about their aircraft, she learned that Lockheed Martin was inviting Twitter users to apply to attend a ceremony marking the delivery of the last F-22 Raptor to the U.S. Air Force. Carson had only been Tweeting for about a year when her application was accepted to the Lockheed Martin ""Tweet Up,"" which brought Twitter users together in May to tour the Georgia facility, meet and greet F-22 pilots, have free lunch and Tweet about the experience. ""I really felt connected to my father by going to this Air Force ceremony,"" said Carson, who traces her love of flying to her late father, who was a bomber pilot in World War II. ""I'm sitting on a plane and we take off -- and I know the science of flying -- but I still think 'how is this possible?' "" said Carson, who also blogged about the experience. ""Humanity has always looked toward the sky, and that's very human nature to look up."" Aviation enthusiasts like Carson aren't interested in your complaints about airline security or packed planes or high prices. To them, the thrill of flight has never gone away, and modern airline technology and design are more fascinating than ever. One big change: No longer satisfied with simple snapshots of the newest Dreamliner for their photo albums or attending air shows or collectors' conventions, these enthusiasts are sharing their journeys online as they try to see and fly the newest airplanes, catch a glimpse of the latest in fighter plane technology or collect the most arcane aviation industry books or snacks. (Use the hashtag #avgeeks to find their postings online.) Sites range from one-man shops to businesses with paid staff and advertising. ""While air travel has become a chore for a lot of people, thanks mostly to the security hassles and airline fees, the fact that you can board a plane, get some sleep and wake up two continents away Ã¢â¬â for a reasonably affordable price Ã¢â¬â can all be traced back to the incredible underlying technology that allows an aircraft to run safely and efficiently for 14-20 hours a day, day in and day out,"" said Matt Molnar, editor of NYCAviation, an aviation website. Airplane boneyard: Aviation geek lists 5 places worth a visit . ""The mind-boggling logistics of running an airline -- from scheduling all the pilots and flight attendants to getting catering trucks where they need to be to cleaning the lavatories -- are also pretty amazing to me,"" said Molnar, who grew up in Queens, New York, obsessed with the airline traffic taking off and landing at nearby LaGuardia and Kennedy airports. Some sites like NYCAviation aim to be the news source for aviation worldwide. Simon Hradecky's Aviation Herald reports every aviation incident and accident that he can track. Matt Cawby's blog reports everything he can capture on video or via camera coming in and out of Boeing's Paine Field. The AMARC Experience explores the amazing aircraft collection at ""the Boneyard,"" the Pentagon's 2,600-acre parking lot for about 5,000 retired military aircraft near Tucson, Arizona. The place where dead airplanes come back to life . Have you seen the Boeing Dreamliner? For some aviation enthusiasts, catching a glimpse of the newest planes, documenting their finds and sharing their photographs is what brings them joy. A top catch these days is the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which Paul McCarthy photographed during Boeing's ""Dream Tour"" stop in Sydney last month. ""Anything about aviation is exciting but the one thing that is really appealing is that change is the only constant,"" wrote McCarthy, community manager of Airliners.net, via e-mail from his home in Sydney. (Airliners.net hosts an active aviation community and includes a renowned collection of aviation photography.) ""No matter what sector, there is always change and no matter what flight it is always different from the previous one. I can also go to the airport to photograph and be assured there will always be something different."" Still, access to a less-exciting Boeing 737-800 can still delight enthusiasts in the right context. Molnar, the NYCAviation editor, flew on a new Boeing 737-800 from the Boeing factory in Washington state to its new home in Rwanda. ""In the U.S. there are hundreds of 737s flying around and the average citizen doesn't blink an eye when American or Southwest receives a new one,"" said Molnar. ""But in Rwanda there was practically a national celebration when we arrived to welcome their first factory-new aircraft."" Do you want a pool table or a trip to Jamaica? Architect Mark Leininger credits his parents for choosing travel to China, Antigua, Colombia and other foreign destinations over material things throughout his childhood, instilling a love that has endured. Case in point: He remembers asking his mother for a pool table in third grade. ""Do you want a pool table or a trip to Jamaica?"" she replied. He wisely opted for the travel, collecting the airline timetables that used to pile up at airport ticket counters in the pre-Internet era. Back then, Leininger also constructed model airports and airplanes at home. Now he designs actual airports as associate director of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, including Boston Logan's international terminal. But he's still a superfan, happily collecting aviation industry books in many languages wherever he travels around the world and attending collectors' conferences when he can. Writer Ryan Ver Berkmoes has loved traveling since he demanded the window seat on a flight to Chicago -- at age 3. He also has a drawer filled with old timetables, and more recently, printed menus from his travels around the world as an author of Lonely Planet travel guidebooks. ""At age 6 my favorite place in the world was O'Hare airport where we would change planes,"" he said. ""I was a little terror with my family, ordering them from, say gate E12 to F6 to make our connections and checking the black and white monitors all the way to make certain nothing had changed."" Despite the hassles of modern-day travel, ""I still get a thrill when we surge down the runway to takeoff,"" said Ver Berkmoes. ""I like anything that includes a feeling of movement. I'm a big fan of turbulence. (It) makes you feel like you're going somewhere."" Companies join the conversation . An aviation company can no longer roll a plane out of the factory or take it on a test flight in the middle of the night and not expect to be tracked by aviation enthusiasts. People are going to find out through Flight Aware, Cawby's blog or elsewhere. ""Why shouldn't we start the conversation and make people feel like they're part of something?"" asked Boeing spokesman Doug Alder. ""We're self-proclaimed aviation geeks, too."" Boeing hosts ""Randy's Blog"" which follows the world travels of a top Boeing marketing VP. It has also hosted three ""Tweet Ups"" to give aviation geeks an insider's view of Boeing and some company freebies. (The company now has four Twitter handles: @boeingairplanes, @boeingdefense, @boeingcareers and @boeing.) It's the worldwide tour of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner that attracted thousands of new of aviation lovers to Boeing's Twitter handles, according to Alder. ""We said when it was coming, when it was going, what it was doing while it was there,"" he said. ""Even when events were not open to the public, we were able to give behind scenes images and take you there."" Perhaps one of aviation's more devoted bloggers is Cawby, who spends nearly 16 hours of almost every day outside Paine Field, the airport outside the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington. He records everything that comes out of the Boeing factory, gets video and pictures, and listens to radio traffic. A couple days ago, he said he rented a helicopter to get shots from the air of the airplanes below. Surprisingly, he professes no love for aviation. He likes recording the news coming out of Paine Field and the fact that people like reading his blog and tweets. ""There's an airplane factory here and there's brand new airplanes coming out and I get all of them,"" he said, speaking from his vantage point at Paine Field. ""You can see everything here."" As if to prove his point, Cawby said he hasn't flown since 1972. He prefers to drive.

"(CNN) -- Most people who travel by train on a regular basis rush through the station so quickly, they never stop to appreciate their surroundings. But some railway terminals deserve a long admiring look for their beauty, their heritage and their engineering accomplishments. Here are five that are on the right track. Grand Central Terminal, New York . For 100 years, New York's Grand Central Terminal has represented big-city hustle and bustle. About 700,000 people pass through it every day; yet, incredible as it seems today, Grand Central almost met its demise in the 1970s. It was rescued in large part by former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who became a driving force behind the campaign to protect and preserve the landmark building, saving it from the fate that befell New York's original Pennsylvania Station in 1963. Renovation and restoration has continued ever since Onassis stepped in. One milestone was the cleaning and restoration of the terminal's 25,000-square-foot cerulean blue and gold leaf zodiac ceiling, which was enhanced further in 2010 with the addition of LEDs to mark specific stars in the heavens. There's a small Transit Museum on the main concourse, and the lower level food court offers so many options, even locals eat there. The Campbell Apartment -- tucked away in a corner on the upper level -- is a clubby place for cocktails. To mark the terminal's 100th anniversary, a schedule of centennial events such as performances, exhibitions and art installations will continue throughout 2013. Where can you go from here? To suburban New York and Connecticut; as far as Poughkeepsie or New Haven and all points in between. The East Side Access project, scheduled for completion in 2019, will provide access to the Long Island Rail Road as well. Then again, this is New York, and you don't really need to go anywhere else to find things to see and do, starting with a guided tour of Grand Central terminal conducted by a docent from the Municipal Art Society of New York or a self-guided audio tour available in six languages. LiÃ¨ge-Guillemins Station, Belgium . In the past, Brussels and Antwerp might have cast a skeptical eye toward LiÃ¨ge, Belgium's third-largest metro area, but their skepticism turned to envy when the stunning steel and glass LiÃ¨ge-Guillemins Station, designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, was unveiled in 2009. It's a remarkable achievement, not least because during the 10 years of its construction, the trains to and from LiÃ¨ge were never shut down. ""It was very important for us to have an architect who had (designed) stations before and knew how to prevent the problems,"" said Louis Maraite, a spokesman for SNCB-Holding, which operates Belgium's rail stations. Before LiÃ¨ge, Calatrava designed Gare de Saint-ExupÃ©ry in Lyon, France, and Oriente Station in Lisbon, among others; he's currently working on a station for Mons, Belgium, that will open before the city becomes European Capital of Culture in 2015. His influence is apparent throughout LiÃ¨ge-Guillemins Station, from its gently peaked 35-meter-high glass roof to the designs of the shops and cafÃ©s on the main concourse to the children's day care facility, the first at a European station. He even makes himself felt in subliminal ways. For instance, there is no advertising on the train platforms; no posters or kiosks interfere with his vision or yours. It's as refreshing and uncluttered as a train station can be. Where can you go from here? The new station was built primarily to accommodate high-speed trains such as the Thalys from France and the Inter-city Express (ICE) from Germany. They will take you to Brussels in less than an hour; Cologne, Germany, in one hour and Paris in a little over two hours. LiÃ¨ge is a working city whose political and religious machinations date to when Charlemagne was a lad (he was born in the area). Local culinary traditions include the gin-like beverage peket, crunchy sugar-coated liÃ¨geoise-style waffles and delicious sweet-and-sour meatballs known as Boulet a la liÃ¨geoise, all of which can be savored at the station. Tokyo Station Marunouchi Building, Japan . Just shy of its 100th birthday, the Tokyo Station Marunouchi Building received a facelift, bringing it as close to the way it looked when it opened in December 1914 as anyone can recall. The restoration was well-deserved; the elegant red brick building has weathered plenty of upheaval in its history. In 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake rocked its foundation. In 1945, the Great Tokyo Air Raid destroyed the roof and much of the building's interior, and the aftermath of World War II resulted in the loss of the building's third story and two architectural domes. Kingo Tatsuno, a prominent architect of the Meiji Period at the turn of the last century, designed the station in a distinctly Western style, a reflection of his time spent studying in Europe. Yet, like his neo-Baroque Bank of Japan ""Old Building"" from 1896, the Tokyo Station Marunouchi Building is a Tokyo landmark. Even in a city that embraces the ultramodern, it would be hard for most residents to conceive of anything that could take its place. The restoration, completed in October 2012, brought back the domes and original architectural features and added Japan's largest seismic isolation system to limit the potential effects of earthquakes. The station's centennial celebration starts in 2014; events will be announced in the coming months. Where can you go from here? A walk through the surrounding Marunouchi business district takes you to the Imperial Palace. Tokyo Station is the primary hub for Japan's famed shinkansen ""bullet trains."" The fastest route on the Tokaido Shinkansen line covers the 246 miles from Tokyo to Osaka/Kyoto in 2Â½ hours. The fastest route on the Tohuko Shinkansen line, traveling at up to 320 kmh, takes you from Tokyo north to Aomori, about 350 miles, in about three hours. Before you board, pick up an ekiben train station bento box for your trip; these flavorful box lunches are designed for train travel and feature regional food specialties. Helsinki Central Station, Finland . In 1923, architect Eliel Saarinen moved from Finland to the United States and became a professor at the University of Michigan. By that time, he'd already left Helsinki a lasting legacy: Helsinki Central Station. It opened in 1919 and remains one of the world's most stunning examples of art nouveau architecture, known in Finland as Jugend. Like many other landmark buildings in Helsinki (Helsinki Cathedral comes to mind), the station is majestic and arresting without being showy, and it represents the marriage of functionality and beauty that still defines Finnish design. Most majestic and arresting of all are the four granite giants who flank the station's main entrance. Created by Emil WikstrÃ¶m, they carry enormous globe lamps, lighting the way for the 200,000 passengers who travel to and from the station daily. Inside the station, people stop in to the Eliel Restaurant as much to see the lovely landscape by Finnish realist artist Eero Jarnefelt on its wall as they do for the light meals served there. Where can you go from here? Last year marked the 150th anniversary of the oldest section of track in Finland, the route between Helsinki and HÃ¤meenlinna, birthplace of Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. Today an express train will take you there in just over one hour. In just over two hours, you can be in the charming, historic city of Turku, with its Swedish heritage, unusual architecture and internationally renowned shipyard where cruise ships are constructed. Farther still, the Allegro train runs from Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia; travel times vary. Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Mumbai . When it opened, it was called Victoria Terminus, in honor of England's Queen Victoria, who had taken the title Empress of India in 1877 and who'd celebrated her Golden Jubilee in 1887. (There was a ceremonial opening in the Jubilee year, but the trains weren't running in earnest until 1888.) Now celebrating its 125th anniversary, Mumbai's central station is known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in honor of the first Maratha emperor, and it maintains its status as one of the world's great Victorian Gothic Revival buildings. British architect Frederick William Stevens gave the station all the ornamentation and grandeur of the Victorian age, and then he added a little bit more: architectural features such as domes and arches derived from Indian styles. Inside, it almost resembles a cathedral, from its vaulted ceiling to the stained-glass windows with images of locomotives instead of religious figures. In 2008, the terminal was the target of a terrorist attack that left the city deeply shaken, but three years later, in 2011, a flash mob of ordinary people dancing to a hit song joyfully ""reclaimed"" the station for the millions of travelers and commuters who pass through it each day. Where can you go from here? Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is the busiest train station in India; Central Railway estimates that 3 million people a day travel on the Mumbai Suburban train system. A regional train to Pune, where the real Chhatrapati Shivaji lived in the 17th century, will take about three to four hours. If you're taking your time, the Deccan Odyssey is an eight-day rail journey that starts and ends at the terminal and takes in palaces, forts, beaches and the UNESCO World Heritage Ellora Caves and Ajanta Caves.","Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava's LiÃ¨ge-Guillemins Station was unveiled in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- There are two certainties in airline seat pockets: pretzel crumbs and SkyMall. And while most travelers try to avoid the mysterious debris left by passengers past, SkyMall has been a welcome addition to the seatback catchalls since the 1990s. ""I found that it was one of those things that anyone who had traveled in the United States kind of knew about,"" said Mike Barish, a freelance travel writer who reviews SkyMall products for the travel site Gadling. ""Some people are in business class; some people are in economy ... some people like to travel, and some people hate it. But everybody knows SkyMall."" The catalog's merchandising team receives hundreds of inquiries every week from vendors, manufacturers and retailers who want their items to be featured, said Joey O'Donnell, customer experience manager for SkyMall. ""We're looking for really special items,"" O'Donnell said. ""We have to look at it and say, 'this solves a problem, and this is so unique. I know our customers will love it.' "" And where else could you purchase a Harry Potter wand, an indoor dog restroom and a fire escape ladder, all from the same place? The merchandising team has been doing its job so well for so long that it can just look at an item and know it's going to be a winner with SkyMall's audience, O'Donnell said. ""We have this garden zombie -- the size of a person -- crawling out of the ground,"" he said. ""When I saw it, I was like, 'no way.' But sure enough, it became one of our top sellers."" Other ""unique"" items aren't so lucky. If you thought the catalog's products were humorous, the list of rejects is downright silly. There's Chuck the Yuck, a ""hip line of barf bags""; GoGirl, which helps women urinate while standing; and The FrankFormer, which ""turns ordinary hot dogs into a smiling 'hot dog man.' "" ""You almost expect them to be fake products from 'Saturday Night Live,' "" Barish said. ""I think the fact that these things actually exist just makes people happy."" Barish's first experience with a SkyMall product was the SkyRest, a giant, wedge-shaped travel pillow that he reviewed for Gadling in 2008. ""If you brought up SkyMall in conversation, it was the one product that someone would make a joke about,"" he said. ""A) because it was so large and B) because the person in the photograph sleeping on it looked so uncomfortable."" Since his first experience, Barish has bought two photo blankets and Fernando, a Chihuahua statue, for his friends. ""Seeing these fun, silly things takes your mind off what is normally a very tedious or uncomfortable situation,"" Barish said of flying. The same goes for comedian Dan Nainan, who took 84 flights in 2010 and purchases from SkyMall regularly. ""There's that time between when you can't use your laptop when you're taking off and landing, so that's prime SkyMall time,"" Nainan said. ""Their selection is so varied that pretty much anybody from any walk of life could pick it up and find something."" From a GPS keychain to video recording sunglasses, Nainan has seen it all -- including a submarine. ""That was a little bit beyond my budget,"" he said, laughing. ""Once in a while, they'll throw in something ridiculously expensive and frivolous like that."" For Barish, that item was the Cruzin Cooler, which combines ""the ability to have cold food or a beverage handy along with the means to get somewhere, without walking,"" according to its website. For $500, the motorized cooler just wasn't worth it to him. ""I don't even know where I'd drive it,"" Barish said. The fun nature of the items featured in the catalog reflects the company's attitude, said Christine Aguilera, CEO of SkyMall. ""We're a company that has high expectations for ourselves, but fun is in our corporate motto,"" Aguilera said. ""That's what makes SkyMall what it is. We scour the Earth to find unique and innovative products."" As proved by the popularity of the corpse zombie, it's hard to know what will work until it's put in front of 1.6 million people per day, she said. But SkyMall wasn't always so quirky. When it began in 1990, founder Bob Worsley pictured SkyMall carrying mainstream products but quickly found that people were wary of buying everyday items at an airport. ""I think people feel that anything at the airport is going to be overpriced,"" Worsley said. ""So what works are unique items that people can't find anywhere else. If they can buy it at the store, then they will probably buy it there."" Since Worsley's original plans for the catalog evolved, SkyMall is more successful than ever. The catalog is available on 88 percent of domestic flights and reaches more than 650 million air travelers each year, according to its website. ""At the end of the day, while everyone laughs at the silly products, I have to imagine that the thing that keeps them going are the practical items,"" Barish said. ""Not everyone wants to spend money on a conversation piece."" For example, the best-selling items in SkyMall's history were a nose hair trimmer and a mosquito magnet (a net that attracts and traps insects), quantity-wise and dollar-wise, respectively. ""Products that solve problems are the ones that work best in SkyMall,"" O'Donnell said. ""But strange sells. The items have to solve a purpose, even if that purpose is just making someone smile."" And with the spreading availability of Wi-Fi on flights, Sky Mall has more smiles to look forward to on the horizon. Its deal with GoGo Inflight Internet allows passengers to browse SkyMall for free, escalating what is already a niche market. ""SkyMall is perfect for things you don't necessarily need but would make great conversation pieces if you were willing to be silly and whimsical enough to actually buy them,"" Barish said. ""It solves the problems we didn't know we had until it told us about them.""","SkyMall has been entertaining air passengers since its debut in 1990 .

"(CNN) -- Lots of sexy, glamorous and irresistible characters make their way through ""Downton Abbey"" -- the television drama that's got audiences around the world fascinated by the intrigue inside an English manor house. But to many fans, the castle is the real star. So much so that it's transforming some viewers into travelers, eager to see for themselves what it might be like to live as a blue-blood or as a servant at the great mansion. First stop: Highclere Castle, the fairytale-like 19th century property about an hour's drive west of London used as the setting for the series and part-time home of the eighth Earl and Countess of Carnarvon. ""It has been amazing,"" said Lady Fiona Carnarvon, describing the effect ""Downton Abbey"" has had on the family's life and the tourist demand to see the castle. ""We have so many e-mails now saying 'We love your home.'"" 'Like walking into Hogwarts' More than e-mails are pouring in. About 50,000 people came to see the house last year, compared to about 30,000 who visited before the series began airing in the U.K. in fall 2010, Lady Carnarvon said. American audiences see the show a few months later. (The series has also inspired the countess to write ""Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey,"" a book about a predecessor who converted Highclere into a hospital during World War I.) Tourist demand is so great that the family is now asking visitors to buy admission in advance and is installing a timed ticket system to avoid having too many people inside the castle at one time. Group visits are already fully booked for 2012, but individuals will be able to pre-book their tickets online starting next month. Even the ""Downton Abbey"" actors are in awe of the setting. ""It's like walking into Hogwarts or something like that in 'Harry Potter,'"" said Rob James-Collier, who plays the scheming footman-turned-sergeant Thomas Barrow in the series, in an interview with a British video production company last fall. ""It's the center of the whole show around which everybody else revolves,"" added Hugh Bonneville, who plays the Earl of Grantham. YouTube: Watch the making of ""Downton Abbey"" For Lady Carnarvon, opening up her beautiful 300-room home to so many visitors just goes with the territory of being part of an aristocratic family. ""I think you have to look positively on it or you've married the wrong husband,"" she said. ""You have to want to share it, which we do."" Showcasing the countryside . Tourists aren't the only ones glad the family is sharing the estate. The popularity of ""Downton Abbey"" is just the latest boost for the British travel industry, which has been riding high since the royal wedding last spring and continues to be red-hot with the approach of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in June and the Summer Olympic Games to be held in London in July. ""Downton"" is especially good at showing visitors that there is more to Britain than just ""London-centric"" landmarks, said Meredith Pearson, a spokeswoman for VisitBritain, the country's national tourism agency. ""This is just the most exciting time for British tourism. It's an unprecedented period of time to have so many incredible events taking place at the same time,"" Person said. ""[Now] 'Downton Abbey' is really showcasing the beauty of our countryside and quaint villages and all of the manor houses across the country. ... We had no idea that it would take on a life of its own. It's just become so popular."" There are lots of options if you want to visit Highclere Castle. The house and gardens are generally open to the public on select days from Easter until September. Since the castle was once the home of the fifth Earl of Carnarvon, who along with Howard Carter discovered Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, the mansion also holds an Egyptian exhibition. Admission to visit the house, gardens and the exhibition costs ÃÂ£16 (about $25) for an adult. For no cost, you can take walks within and near the estate. The deluxe tour . Then again, if you'd like to get a more intimate look at the castle, there's a new, much pricier option that's being offered by NoteWorthy Events, a travel agency that specializes in the United Kingdom. Owner Susie Worthy calls it an exclusive tour created in response to interest in the ""Masterpiece Classic"" series. Do you and a few of your fellow ""Downton Abbey"" fans have about $12,300 to spare? If so, you can explore the castle, dine at the mansion and meet the aristocrats who call it home. As part of the package, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon will personally greet you when you arrive at the main entrance and invite you to tea and coffee served in the Countess' morning room. You'll get a private tour of the State Rooms, before sitting down for lunch in the State Dining Room, complete with wines chosen by the earl from his wine cellar. After the meal, you'll be whisked off to Beacon Hill, which provides sweeping views of the property. End your day with high tea back at the castle. Up to four people can take part in the pricey tour. Worthy wasn't aware of any takers yet, but said it's hard to resist the castle's allure. ""It's an escape from your humdrum life, really,"" Worthy said, noting that the grand manor lifestyle is attracting interest from lots of British travelers exploring their own history, as well as international visitors. ""It's another world. They want to leave their small house and go and see something wonderful, and they want to see lovely gardens and estates. They want to almost be part of it, although it doesn't belong to them."" Where else to explore . Beyond Highclere Castle, some tourists also head to the village of Bampton in Oxfordshire, where many of the exterior town scenes in the series are filmed. A stop there is often standard in some of the ""Downton Abbey"" themed tours that have popped up in response to fan demand, such as the ones offered by Brit Movie Tours and Great British Tours. Pearson recommended that fans inspired to check out other spectacular sites used in popular British films and TV shows -- including ""Young Victoria"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" -- should visit the National Trust website for a map of filming locations in England. Such ""set-jetting"" trips have become one of the most popular travel trends for American tourists in Britain, she said. A trend only getting hotter, thanks to ""Downton Abbey.""","""Downton Abbey"" is transforming many fans into tourists .

"(CNN) -- Oktoberfest kicks off in Munich on September 22. But Munich is across an ocean â and ocean-crossing plane tickets are expensive, as are hotels and transportation and schnitzel. Fortunately, there are beer festivals across the United States running parallel to the fest's official September 22-October 7 schedule. Look out for the smaller festivals if you want a more intimate experience, advises Derek Buono, publisher of Beer Magazine. If you're after new flavors, keep an eye out for fests that stock rare brews. If you prefer a party, the biggest festivals emphasize atmosphere, scheduling bands and food vendors, in addition to breweries. Your biggest problems, suggests Buono, will be picking one beer festival, because there are so many. Here are five festivals to choose from so Oktoberfest need not go uncelebrated. They are big and small, stretching from the Northeast onward. They include tastings, trainings and at least one bratwurst eating contest, in Louisville, Kentucky. No doubt there's a festival near you, so mark your calendars and raise your glasses. World Beer Festival (September 22, St. Petersburg, Florida, $40-$85; October 6, Durham, North Carolina, $40-$45) Founded 17 years ago, the World Beer Festival is a multi-city, multi-date affair, presented by All About Beer Magazine. Its flagship is still Durham, where festival organizers expect to have as many as 250 beers this year, up from 170 last year. But the St. Pete fest is new, and it's the first time the event has been held outside the Carolinas. It's a reflection of the ""massively growing craft beer market"" in the Tampa Bay area, said All About Beer beer and brewery manager Leigh Hambleton. Photos: Oktoberfest 2012 . With its slate of events and materials, including tastings and an online ""Beer 101"" guide, the festival and magazine are committed to ""spreading the word about craft beer,"" Hambleton said. That means showing off the best beverages and helping people learn how to drink them. Louisville Craft Beer Week (September 21-29, Louisville, Kentucky, tickets range by day and event; prices range from free to $75) Louisville's Craft Beer Week, backed by LouisvilleBeer.com, isn't a celebration of Oktoberfest exactly, but it's full of celebratory Oktoberfest events, including eating contests and the release of a slate of fall beers. Casktoberfest, hosted by the St. Matthews location of the Bluegrass Brewing Co., is the week's kick-off and there are dozens more events that follow. The festival hopes to keep widening: This year, it's partnering with the Louisville Eccentric Observer (LEO, for short), the city's alternative weekly, to publish an event guide. The expectation is ""people that didn't even know [it] existed will find out about it,"" said John Wurth, the founder of LouisvilleBeer.com. Beer festivals around town used to draw 100 people. Now they draw thousands, said Wurth. BBC brewery used to reach out to crowds. Now it has to turn them away. Texas Craft Brewers Festival (October 6, Austin, Texas, $20-$77) The self-described ""largest annual celebration of Texas craft beer,"" the Texas Craft Brewers Festival, which benefits Austin Sunshine Camps that serve at-risk kids, has been around since 2003. Held in historic Fiesta Gardens in East Austin, the festival will feature nearly 30 Texas breweries â from No Label to Thirsty Planet â and more than 100 beers. Beer and chocolate and beer and cheese pairing sessions are scheduled. New Orleans on Tap (September 29, New Orleans, Louisiana, $1-$100) Last year, New Orleans on Tap exploded. Supporting the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, New Orleans on Tap is a co-production with the Bulldog, a local bar. It was the Bulldog's founder who first brought up the idea of doing a fundraiser-festival, said Marisa Collins, events coordinator for the Louisiana SPCA. When autumn leaves fall . That was three years ago. Last year, 7,000 people attended New Orleans on Tap and it raised $100,000. Organizers expect more this year, Collins said. It's ""huge for such a young event to explode like that,"" she said, ""but I think we hit the right chord with young New Orleanians that like drinking and that like being outside."" Schuylkill BrewFest (September 22, Pottsville, Pennsylvania, $10-$25) Pottsville is the home of the two-year-old Schuylkill BrewFest, and it's also home to Yuengling, America's oldest brewing company. One led to the other. ""Basically what we're doing is celebrating the traditional brewing of German beer in the home of America's oldest brewery,"" said Keri Johnson, communications coordinator for the Schuylkill County Visitors' Bureau and one of the festival organizers. It's a small group behind the scenes, but support from both the community and Yuengling, which encouraged the festival to seek out microbreweries across Pennsylvania, has been strong. The second time around, the BrewFest has quadrupled the number of home brew applicants it has and expanded its programming slate as well: There will be beers to taste and beers to buy and, Johnson said, a band that specializes in Austrian music. One more to consider: . If youÂ¹re already thirsty for next year, put the Great American Beer Festival in Denver on your list. This yearÂ¹s October event is sold out, but Buono calls it ""the best 40 bucks you could spend on beer."" Put on by the Brewers Association, a national trade organization supporting craft beer, the festival has been going on since 1982. It brings thousands of people from across the country and spans three days with more than 2,000 beers to taste. Where do you like to celebrate Oktoberfest or just grab a pint? Please tell us in the comments below.","There are festivals around the country that overlap with Oktoberfest .

"(CNN) -- More than three months after safety issues grounded the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Ethiopian Airlines became the first to resume service with a commercial flight Saturday. Nearly 50 Dreamliners around the world had been out of commission after two incidents on jets operated by Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question. Boeing last week began installing a redesigned battery system in the aircraft. The Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner flight carried passengers from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, Kenya, the company said. The move follows the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration posting a directive outlining the modifications necessary for the Dreamliner to fly again. Japan this week authorized its passenger airlines to resume Dreamliner flights, but it wasn't clear when they they would reinstate the aircraft. The Dreamliner's use of lightweight composite materials to greatly improve fuel economy has made it a big seller in Asia and the Middle East, where long-haul flights account for much of an airline's business. United Airlines, which has six Boeing 787 aircraft, is the only U.S. airline to take delivery of the Dreamliner so far. It will cost the airline about $2.8 million to implement the fix, according to the FAA's Federal Register filing. The company plans to begin domestic flights using the 787 in May and possibly launch the Denver-Narita, Japan, route on June 10.

"(CNN) -- Green markets, farmers' markets, fresh markets, wet markets -- whatever you call them, these are the places that make Walmart, Tesco and other supermarket chains look like crimes against cuisine. Often centuries old but full of freshness, markets are usually packed with dozens of vendors and worth visiting even if you have no intention of cooking anything yourself on your vacation. 1. La Boqueria: Barcelona, Spain . Believed to have originated in the 13th century as a pig market, the Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria has grown into one of the finest outdoor markets in the world.

The market has the distinction of supplying restaurants all over the world with fresh fish. It's also one of Tokyo's biggest tourist attractions, where visitors gather in the pre-dawn hours to gawp at the frenetic auction of dozens of enormous tuna. The outer market, located in a maze of tiny streets packed with retail shops, allows visitors the chance to purchase seafood and other food supplies and enjoy an early morning sashimi meal. 5-2-1 Tsukiji, Tokyo, Japan; +81 3 3542 1111; www.tsukiji-market.or.jp . 3. Union Square Farmer's Market: New York City, United States . In the 1970s, New York City's Union Square was a seedy, crime-ridden area of Manhattan until a small farmers' market took root and revitalized the area. The market has grown into one of the world's best, with more than 140 regional farmers, fishmongers, bakers and butchers catering to more than 60,000 shoppers on peak days. The greenmarket showcases more than just fresh-picked produce, though. Celebrity chefs often use the space for cooking demonstrations, there are school tours that teach local kids about seasonality and healthy eating and education programs, including one that helps New Yorkers learn about composting.

"(CNN) -- Faultless service, delicious eateries, see-and-be-seen nightlife venues and fabulous decor are traditionally the key ingredients to creating the kind of hotels that attract the international jet set. But these days, a competitive, wildly diluted hospitality landscape requires hoteliers to come up with more unique ways to engage travelers. A spate of properties are rising to the occasion with eye-catching arts programing -- from extensive collaborations with arts organizations to interior design that relies as much on paintings and sculptures as it does on furniture to set a scene. Take the James Royal Palm in Miami. This months-old beachside haven has already gained quite the following for its stunning private rooms and Florida Cookery, the bustling on-site restaurant. But with its Cultural Collection initiative, the hotel has partnered with several local and national creative outfits that will stage site-specific projects exclusive to the property. New York City-based fashion label Public School, for example, designed the staff's uniforms, and Miami's Museum of Contemporary Art worked with the hotel and artist Jorge Pantoja to craft a five-piece collection of paintings displayed in the lobby. And across the Atlantic, the recently opened Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht is now home to what it says is the largest in-hotel video art collection in the world, transforming the property into more than just a hotel -- it's an art gallery now, too. So if you'd like a little culture right on your doorstep, check out these hotels with an artful approach to hospitality: . The James Royal Palm, Miami . In addition to the hotel's joint efforts with some of the country's leading arts and culture groups, The James Royal Palm in South Beach also provides a great-looking backdrop for renowned interior designer Lauren Rottet's exquisite taste in art. Titled An Ocean Apart, the collection's paintings (including the aforementioned works by Jorge Pantoja), digital pieces and sculptures were all hand-picked by Rottet herself. Some are from well-known names such as Alex Prager and Gavin Perry, while others are works by recent art-school grads and future industry luminaries -- like 2012 University of Florida alumnus Chad Cunha -- and can be found and admired all over the property. Six new spots for architecture lovers . Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht . In Dutch design maestro Marcel Wanders, this canal-side property has a national treasure working on its decor and visuals, which would have been enough to garner it well-deserved attention. But walls animated with video creations from art-world celebrities like Yael Bartana, Martha Colburn and Cristina Lucas have made the hotel even more popular among Amsterdam's creative community. Four Seasons Hotel Ritz Lisbon . Since it opened back in 1959, the Four Seasons' sole outpost on the Iberian Peninsula has been dedicated to supporting local artists and using their works to add Portuguese flair to the hotel's overall design. Now, the property owns no fewer than 500 pieces -- a massive collection on view throughout, from paintings of traditional countryscapes in the lobby to the bronze sculptures of seahorses that decorate the restaurant. To make sense of it all, a digital application is due out this fall to show guests where they can find each piece, who made it and what it's all about . Le Royal Monceau Raffles Paris . Raffles' City of Light outpost has a lot going for it, from the Philippe Starck-designed interiors to a can't-be-beaten address steps away from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. Art aficionados will appreciate the on-site bookshop that stocks a wide range of coffee table volumes and catalogs both rare and mainstream, as well as the paintings, photography and installations that show up all over the hotel from international artists like Portuguese sculptor Joana Vasconcelos and English artist Stephen Smith. If you're in town to experience art away from the hotel, Le Royal Monceau Raffles Paris has its very own art concierge who creates a weekly list of art-related events happening all over Paris, from small gallery exhibitions to private consultations with local dealers. 7 ways to celebrate Florida's 500th . Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong . Hong Kong will be the third destination to play host to Art Basel (after Miami and the title city of Basel), and the Mandarin Oriental there is geared to be the official hotel for the event when it kicks off in May. And why not? Works by aspiring stars of the local arts community can be found on its walls, including those of the Clipper Lounge, a chic watering hole that serves as a launch pad for Hong Kong's hopefuls. Last year, 28-year-old Tang Kwok Hin exhibited his work there, and this year, his creations will make an appearance in Art Basel in a group show called Discoveries. Faena Hotel Buenos Aires . The Faena Group has created an important art district in Buenos Aires in a revitalized dock area. The Faena Hotel, housed in a converted grain barn, is blocks away from the Faena Arts Center, which opened in 2011 in a former flour mill. Rotating exhibits at the center feature contemporary art from all over the world. The general admission fee of $20 is waived for hotel guests. Faena has also started a residency program, where an artist gets to shack up at one of the hotel's stylish rooms and work on his or her craft. In November, it was Franz Ackermann -- known for his colorfully bombastic yet abstract creations. Faena also awards a Prize for the Arts. The 2012 winner was Argentine artist Franco DarÃÂ­o Vico, whose work will be exhibited at the center in July. 21c Museum Hotel, Bentonville, Arkansas . While the rest of the hotels featured on this list hail from some of the biggest cities on the globe, 21c makes the cut for its third outpost, a 2-month-old operation tucked away in Bentonville, Arkansas. 21c has made headlines for delivering properties that nurture the contemporary arts scene in Louisville and Cincinnati. The Bentonville offshoot is equipped with 12,000 square feet of exhibition and event space that will see a rotation of solo and group shows. Eight site-specific installations (from sculpture to wallpaper) from emerging artists like Alexandre Arrechea and Rob Wynne are currently on display.","Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht features an impressive collection of video art .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Boeing 787 Dreamliner took off Sunday from a Tokyo airport, the first such flight in Japan since safety issues grounded the Dreamliner fleet, officials told CNN. Japan had authorized passenger airlines to resume flying the embattled aircraft in the country starting Friday, authorities said. The first test flight in Japan was Sunday, All Nippon Airways officials said. It left Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Sunday morning with a team of All Nippon engineers, that airline's chairman, Shinichiro Ito, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner. The plane landed about two hours later without incident, Boeing said. ""With the successful completion of today's flight, Boeing will continue to work closely with airline customers in Japan and other countries on ... modification work to safely return additional 787s to flight in the coming weeks,"" Boeing said in a statement. The flight marked a milestone in Japan, but the plane wasn't the first Dreamliner to take flight since the problems first surfaced. Ethiopian Airlines flew passengers from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, Kenya, on Saturday. Boeing Dreamliner back in skies . Nearly 50 Dreamliners around the world have been grounded for more than three months, after two incidents on jets operated by Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question. Officials later pointed to faulty battery systems in recommending the planes be grounded. Last week, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared Boeing to make fixes to the problematic battery system. Boeing said it was deploying teams to help the airlines install the redesigned system. In an online posting Thursday, the FAA outlined the modifications necessary for the Dreamliner to fly again. By the next day, All Nippon and Japan Airlines -- the world's two largest Dreamliner operators -- had already begun installing modified lithium ion batteries on their 787 jets. The Dreamliner's use of lightweight composite materials to greatly improve fuel economy has made it a big seller in Asia and the Middle East, where long-haul flights account for much of an airline's business.

"(CNN) -- The fate of the country for the next four years could be decided by whichever Republican presidential contender comes out on top this Super Tuesday. A big deal? Perhaps. But for travelers interested in all things presidential, the real race is for the next presidential birthplace. Will the winner once again be Hawaii, which won the crown when voters chose President Barack Obama in 2008? Or will it be Virginia, the holder of the record for most presidential birthplaces? Or could it be Pennsylvania or Michigan, both swing states in presidential politics with many apolitical delights to entertain the traveler? To avoid any accusation of preference toward one birthplace over another, we list the states in reverse alphabetical order. The mother of all presidential birthplaces . While not commenting on current presidential politics, Virginia Tourism Corp.'s Tamra Talmadge-Anderson did cite Virginia's record of birthing eight U.S. presidents, more than any other state. ""We also are home to more presidential homes -- Mount Vernon, Monticello, Montpelier -- and sites than any other state,"" she said. If elected president, Rick Santorum would bestow the honor of presidential birthplace to Winchester, Virginia, nestled in the Shenandoah Valley. Just an hour outside Washington, Winchester plays host to many George Washington and Civil War enthusiasts and explorers of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah Valley. Many visitors enjoy the elegant George Washington Hotel in downtown Winchester. For a break from political history, head to the Patsy Cline Historic House, where the country singer lived from ages 16 to 25. Pennsylvania doubles its chances . Although Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul are both trailing in the national polls, they still give Pennsylvania two chances to win the honor of next presidential birthplace. Gingrich was born in the state capital of Harrisburg and Paul in Green Tree, a suburb of Pittsburgh. History buffs can head to Harrisburg to visit the National Civil War Museum, which claims to fairly portray both Union and Confederate history. The museum houses 24,000 artifacts and other Civil War items. For a snack with your dose of history, visit the Broad Street Market. Dating back to 1860, it's the oldest continuously operated market house in the country, with vendors selling organic and local produce, baked goods, ready-to-eat meals and more. Pittsburgh is host to some impressive museum collections. The Frick Art & Historical Center features Pittsburgh's Gilded Age, courtesy of Helen Clay Frick, daughter of Henry Clay Frick, one of America's greatest industrialists and art collectors. The museum of Pittsburgh native Andy Warhol has more than 8,000 of the artist's works. Nearby Meadowcroft Rockshelter, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest site of human habitation on the North American continent. Tours of Rockshelter, featuring the 16,000-year-old rock overhang used by our ancestors for shelter, start again for schools in April and for the general public in May. The Motor City and beyond . Although Mitt Romney served as governor of Massachusetts, he was born in Detroit and raised in Bloomfield Hills, the son of auto executive and former Michigan Gov. George Romney. While it has undergone a radical reconstruction as the nation's economic woes gripped Detroit in particular, there is still much to enjoy in the Motor City. Head to the Motown Historical Museum for a tour of Motown's contributions to American music. For more of Romney's childhood, head to Bloomfield Hills, home to the only Mormon temple in the state. The wealthy suburb is also home to the Cranbrook Art Museum, home to the renowned arts academy. The museum's grand re-opening show is on display through March 25. The site also includes Saarinen House, the home and studio of the noted Finnish-American designer and art academy president Eliel Saarinen. (The house reopens for tours on May 3.) Head to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn to explore Michigan's automotive culture, where presidential limousines get their own exhibition. (Not limited to automobiles, Ford also has an exhibition on early aviators and the architecture of R. Buckminster Fuller. Head over to Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, where people happily indulge in the famous deli's corned beef sandwich and other edibles. Presidential Hawaii . Hawaii was a popular tourist destination before President Obama drew even more attention to the 50th state because of his birth on August 4, 1961, at the Kapiolani Hospital for Women & Children in the city of Honolulu on the island of Oahu. Now there's an ""Obama's Hawaii"" section of the state tourism website. After four years in Indonesia, Obama returned to Hawaii at age 10 to live with his grandparents, attending the Punahou School and playing on the state championship basketball team. For people who want to trace his childhood steps, he lived in the neighborhood of Makiki, worked at a local Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream and swam at Sandy Beach on the eastern tip of Oahu. The state continues to benefit from the attention President Obama and the first family bring when they return to Hawaii for family visits. ""The windward side of Oahu becomes the focus, the town of Kailua, as well as some of his regular stops: the golf courses and Alan Wong's Restaurant,"" says John Monahan, president and CEO of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau. ""If there's one thing the president has done during his visits is bring further awareness to other parts of Oahu, beyond the famous resort area of Waikiki, to smaller towns, unique eats like shave ice, and family places like Sea Life Park, Honolulu Zoo and others.""

"(CNN) -- Eliot Spitzer, who resigned as governor of New York in the wake of a prostitution scandal, is looking at a return -- this time as comptroller of New York City. He said he hoped that voters would be able to see beyond his past. ""I accepted responsibly for what I did,"" Spitzer told CNN late Sunday night. ""I spent five years of working, doing useful things, and I hope the public will offer me an opportunity."" Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned in 2008 after revelations about his relationship with a prostitute. Since stepping down, he has worked as a commentator for various news outlets, including CNN. In running for comptroller, Spitzer said he's looking for forgiveness and a second chance. ""The metaphor is what I did with the attorney general's office,"" he said. ""It is ripe for greater and more exciting use of the office's jurisdiction."" Besides serving as governor, Spitzer was New York's attorney general. Spitzer said he has his wife's support as he jumps back into political life, but doesn't know if she'll be joining him on the campaign trail.","NEW: Spitzer says he plans to run for comptroller .

"(CNN) -- Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, facing a five-year prison term and free pending an appeal, returned to Moscow on Saturday and vowed he will be elected mayor. Hundreds of supporters and journalists met Navalny's train as he returned from his trial in Kirov, according to state-run Ria Novosti. ""We are a huge, powerful force,"" Navalny told the crowd. ""I'm very glad that we've started to recognize that force ourselves. ... I want to apologize to you for not believing so strongly in you."" His apology referred to his statements Friday that he was not certain he would run for mayor. By Saturday, he was declaring, ""We will go to the elections and we will win,"" Rio Novosti reported. Navalny was detained overnight Thursday after a court in Kirov city found him guilty of misappropriating about $500,000 in a lumber deal when he was an adviser to the region's governor. He was released Friday. Navalny denied wrongdoing and said he was targeted because he is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics. 'A parody of a prosecution' Navalny's conviction and sentencing Thursday prompted wide condemnation. The European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, called the trial a sham. And former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev issued a statement saying the case ""unfortunately confirms that we do not have an independent judiciary."" Navalny has been a prominent organizer of street protests, and has attacked corruption in Russian government. ""Navalny's prosecution is meant to silence a leader and messenger,"" said Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Europe division . Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia program director, John Dalhuisen, said, ""This was a parody of a prosecution and a parody of a trial.

"(CNN) -- Four Russian nationals and a Ukrainian have been charged with running a massive scheme to steal info from more than 160 million credit and debit cards at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Each of the five men indicted had different roles in what the Department of Justice described Thursday in a news release as ""the largest such scheme ever prosecuted in the United States."" According to that U.S. agency, one of the accused hosted ""bullet-proof"" web-hosting services, two of the defendants hacked corporate networks, one mined and stole sensitive data and the fifth sold that information to ""identity theft wholesalers."" Two of the men were arrested at the request of U.S. authorities in June 2012 in the Netherlands. One of them, Dmitriy Smilianets, was extradited months later to the United States. He'll appear in a federal court in New Jersey on the new charges of hacking conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, unauthorized computer access and wire fraud, according to the Department of Justice. The three other indicted men were still at large Thursday. They are all accused of having targeted more than a dozen major American and international companies between 2005 and 2012, including JCPenney, Carrefour, 7-Eleven, Nasdaq, JetBlue, Dow Jones and Ingenicard. More than 130 million card numbers were stolen from one company alone -- Heartland, a U.S.-based credit and debit card processing company -- resulting in about $200 million in losses, according to the U.S. federal court indictment unsealed Thursday. in a federal court in New Jersey . ""Those who have the expertise and the inclination to break into our computer networks threaten our economic well-being, our privacy, and our national security,"" said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, whose jurisdiction is New Jersey. ""And this case shows, there is a real practical cost because these types of frauds increase the cost of doing business for every American consumer, every day."" Working with co-conspirators -- at least one of whom, Albert Gonzalez of Miami, is now serving a 20-year prison sentence related to several data breaches, according to the news release -- they'd ""probe potential vulnerabilities"" in their targets' websites and, in some cases, would even visit their retail stores, the indictment states. Then they would strike against retailers and other corporations engaged in financial transactions or the transmission of financial data. The defendants used computers in at least seven countries, including the United States, and anonymous web-hosting services allegedly provided by one of those charged, Mikhail Rytikov, to help hide their identities. Two of the defendants -- Alexandr Kalinin and Vladimir Drinkman, the latter of whom was arrested last year in the Netherlands -- would allegedly hack into networks and install malicious code, or malware, to make these systems more vulnerable. In some instances, this malware might be in place for more than a year. Once in, another of the accused -- Roman Kotov -- allegedly would capture loads of data such as user names and passwords, other identifying info and credit and debit card numbers. This information would then be sold by Smilianets at a price that varied, depending on its origin, U.S. authorities claim in the indictment. A single U.S. credit card number, for instance, would go for $10, a Canadian one for $15 and a European number for $50, according to the indictment. Bulk and repeat ""customers"" shopping for this illicit info got discounted prices. This data would then be encrypted on blank cards, which could be used to withdraw cash from ATMs or make purchases. Also Thursday -- in addition to the charges outlined in the indictment -- the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced two additional indictments against Kalinin for hacking servers used by the financial securities market Nasdaq. A separate indictment accuses Kalinin and another Russian, Nikolay Nasenkov, of engineering a scheme to hack U.S.-based financial institutions, steal account information and withdraw millions of dollars from victims' bank accounts. ""As today's allegations make clear, cyber criminals are determined to prey not only on individual bank accounts, but on the financial system itself,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. The various hacking charges come on the same day that Stanford University experienced what it called ""an apparent breach of its information technology infrastructure similar to incidents reported in recent months by a range of companies and large organizations in the United States."" In a message linked from its official Twitter feed, Stanford said it was still looking into the origin and the impact of the apparent breach. ""We do not yet know the scope of the intrusion, but we are working closely with information security consultants and law enforcement to determine its source and impact,"" the university said.","4 Russians, 1 Ukrainian are charged in what the U.S. alleges is a massive hacking conspiracy .

"Dearborn, Michigan (CNN) -- If the crooked blue staircase, colorful crank and dangling bathtub looked familiar, well, that's the point. ""Who wants to play 'The Life Size Mousetrap' -- and sign a waiver?"" a big top voice boomed across the Maker Faire at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, this summer. Ahh, yes. At this annual celebration of DIY culture, of course this would appear: a scaled-up version of ""Mouse Trap,"" the Hasbro game bent on marbles zigging through a plastic labyrinth. And the circus voice? That would be Mark Perez, creator of the larger-than-life board game. Almost every run begins with a boardwalk-style sales pitch of his grand machine. ""Are there any engineers in the house?"" a voice bellowed over the sound system, drawing a few claps. ""Who likes to do math in here?"" it demanded, drawing ... nothing. ""Let's not have this weak applause for math! MATH!"" Perez played ""Mouse Trap"" a lot as a kid -- kind of. Nobody followed the rules, he said. They just liked to build the machine and make it work. In his house, they built and rebuilt the contraption so often, they'd get a new version of the game every couple years. ""I decided one day to put three of them together to see if I could make them all work and hopefully not poke my sister's eye out,"" he said. His sister's eye was fine. And as he grew up, the mystique of the Rube Goldberg machine didn't leave him. Why Rube Goldberg machines still matter in 2012 . It took him 13 years and 50,000 pounds of stuff to build the big one. The crane alone took two years: It's all hand-built, but it's capable of lifting a two-ton safe 30 feet in the air. Its role in the game was to trap a plastic mouse. Because this is real life, and the Henry Ford Museum, its role was to crush a junked white Hyundai. ""It's the grand finale,"" Perez said. But you've got to ask: Why? Why build it? Why take it on the road? (He did a 10,000-mile tour last year, Perez said. Considering it costs $3 a mile to move, it ain't cheap.) Why put the time, money, effort into oversized rainy day entertainment? Spectacle. Perez is a showman and artist, in addition to being a builder. He likes the craft, the handiwork, doing something he doesn't really understand. He's not really a physics guy, but this project turned him into one. So why not everybody else? ""One of our major goals is to teach kids and adults about the physics that surround us,"" Perez said. ""Give us the really unplugged vision -- you know it's not wired in. It's the real thing with counterweights and science and engineering."" It's just an idea, but the guy is on to something. A new set of standards for science education is in development now and expected to debut early next year. Classrooms might feel a bit more like Perez's machine than tidy rows of desks, said Gerald Wheeler, interim executive director of the National Science Teachers Association. How a 21st-century science class should look . Some kids excel with a page of gray text. Others need to see something bubble or break before they can really understand. And all of them can benefit from realizing that experiments on paper don't always work in practice. Wheeler has seen those kind of revelations happen in science classes. Students have had to design a system of pulleys, planes and screws to do something simple like put cereal in a bowl. (For the advanced crowd, make 'em do the math for milk, too.) ""The computer screen, like the physics textbook, can be pretty clean. Physics is a lot cleaner when you don't have to worry about air resistance,"" Wheeler said. ""Using it as a team, in the real world, very much mimics what the NASA engineers have to do."" States can decide whether to adopt the standards, but demand from students, teachers and corporate America makes Wheeler optimistic for the future of hands-on, ""really unplugged"" science, as Perez put it. ""It's going to be messy,"" Wheeler said. ""It's going to be a challenge for the country to get behind that, but it's much more directed toward creating (science, technology, engineering and math) careers. ""They won't be smashing cars, but they will be putting cereal in a cereal bowl."" Perez, for what it's worth, isn't always smashing cars, either. He knows all too well that not every test in every experiment will work. His big machine takes five days to assemble with a crew of 10, builders and performers all of them.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American cleric who was born in New Mexico and who would go on to become an al-Qaeda leader in Yemen, did not silence his siren call to jihad. That fact was underlined Thursday by the indictment against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who together with his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly carried out the deadly Boston Marathon bombing on April 15. Some time before the Boston bombings, Dzhokhar downloaded a digital copy of a book for which Awlaki, who died in 2011, had written the foreword. The book directed Muslims not to give allegiance to countries such as the United States that have invaded Muslim lands. Four days after the Boston bombings, surrounded by police and fearing death while hiding in a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts, Dzhokhar wrote messages that seemed to echo Awlaki's ideas such as ""The U.S. government is killing our innocent civilians"" and ""We Muslims are one body; you hurt one, you hurt us all."" The Tsernaevs are only the tip of Awlaki's influence on American militants. According to a count by the New America Foundation, 24 ""homegrown"" violent jihadist extremists in the United States who have been indicted or convicted of terrorism or have been killed while engaged in violent jihad since 2001 read Awlaki's propaganda or maintained contact with him. This accounts for around one in five of all jihadist extremists indicted, convicted or killed since Awlaki's influence was cited for the first time in court documents in 2007, when his name turned up among the literature being read by members of a plot to attack the Ft. Dix military base in southern New Jersey. From the grave, terrorist inspires a new generation . Awlaki first came to the attention of the FBI while he was living in San Diego where he had come into contact with two of the 9/11 hijackers in 2000. The FBI investigated those connections but was unable to discover if Awlaki had any nefarious connections to the hijackers. Awlaki was working as an imam in Virginia in 2002. He then traveled to the United Kingdom and then to Yemen where his family was from. In 2007, after a spell in a Yemeni jail that he blamed on the United States, Awlaki became more radicalized and he adopted an increasingly strident anti-American tone in his sermons, which were widely distributed on the Internet. Soon Awlaki joined up with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. His role at first was as a spiritual adviser. But he became more involved in operations over time. For instance, he played a central role in the recruitment of the Nigerian ""underwear bomber"" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, court documents showed. Since Awlaki's death in the 2011 drone strike, other militants have continued to be influenced by Awlaki's propaganda. Quazi Nafis, a 21-year old Bangladeshi on a student visa, was arrested in 2012 for plotting to bomb the New York Federal Reserve. Nafis told a government informant that Awlaki's ideas had influenced him. In December 2012, Randy Wilson and Mohammad Abukhdair were arrested in Georgia while attempting to travel to fight for al Shabaab, the al Qaeda affiliate in Somalia. According to the indictment Abukhdair provided an informant with compact discs containing lectures by Awlaki, and Wilson watched Awlaki's videos. It is not surprising that Awlaki's influence has not disappeared following his death. Awlaki's role in the radicalization of homegrown extremists was not primarily that of directing and facilitating operations. Only four U.S.-based extremists maintained contact with Awlaki rather than simply reading or watching his propaganda, according to the New America Foundation count. Authorities say Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, accused of murder in the 2009 Fort Hood, Texas, shooting spree that killed 13 people, communicated with Awlaki by e-mail prior to the attack. He also followed Awlaki's publications very closely. However, a commission conducted after the attack to review the FBI's failure to prevent the shooting found no evidence that Awlaki directed Hasan's attack. Awlaki also is said to have played an important role in the radicalization of Zachary Chesser, a Virginia resident who planned to join al Shabaab. According to a report by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Chesser rapidly radicalized after his conversion to Islam in the summer of 2008 and was heavily influenced by Awlaki. Chesser began to post his writings on Awlaki's blog and began an e-mail correspondence with him, authorities have said. Chesser decided to join al Shabaab's struggle in Somalia because of Awlaki's teachings on jihad, according to the congressional report. Chesser was arrested as he was about to fly to Africa from New York City in July 2010. Looking to the future, the role of Awlaki's propaganda as a driver of homegrown extremism will largely be determined by whether the materials he produced before he died remain relevant and easily available on the many websites that distribute his lectures. The Boston bombings remind us that at least as of now, Awlaki continues to exert his influence even from beyond the grave.","Anwar al-Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011, but continues to influence jihadists .

"(CNN) -- What if everything you thought you knew about education was wrong? What if students learn more quickly on their own, working in teams, than in a classroom with a teacher? What if tests and discipline get in the way of the learning process rather than accelerate it? Those are the questions Sugata Mitra has been asking since the late 1990s, and for which he was awarded the $1 million TED Prize in February at the TED2013 conference. Mitra, professor of educational technology at Newcastle University, won the prize for his concept of ""self organized learning environments,"" an alternative to traditional schooling that relies on empowering students to work together on computers with broadband access to solve their own problems, with adults intervening to provide encouragement and admiration, rather than top-down instruction. Watch Sugata Mitra's TED Prize talk . Mitra's work with students in India has gained wide attention and was the focus of a 2010 TED Talk on his ""hole in the wall"" experiment, showing the potential of computers to jump-start learning without any adult intervention. Coming to education trained as a physicist, Mitra said he was encouraged by his boss to start teaching people how to write computer programs. When he bought his first personal computer, he was surprised to find that his 6-year-old son was able to tell him how to fix problems he had operating the machine. He thought his son was a genius, but then heard his friends saying the same thing about their children. Thinking about children living in slums in New Delhi, he said, ""It can't be possible that our sons are geniuses and they are not."" Mitra set up a publicly accessible computer along the lines of a bank ATM, behind a glass barrier, and told children they could use it, with no further guidance. TED.com: Sugata Mitra's five favorite TED Talks on education . They soon learned to browse the Web in English, even though they lacked facility in the language. To prove the experiment would work in an isolated environment, he set up another ""hole in the wall"" computer in a village 300 miles away. After a while, ""one of the kids was saying we need a faster processor and a better mouse."" When the head of the World Bank came to see the experiment, Mitra said he encouraged him to go to the New Delhi slum and see for himself. After spending time with the children, bank President James Wolfensohn ""came back and put his hand on my shoulder and said, 'How much?' "" Mitra said he received $1.5 million, which allowed him to press on with experiments in India, Cambodia and Africa, finding self-organized learning worked to improve English-language pronunciation, reading comprehension and even the basics of DNA replication. Mitra said the traditional system of education is largely based on the necessities created by Britain's colonial empire in which a vast amount of territory had to be governed by people writing things on paper and sending them around the world on ships. Schools turned out clerks who functioned as interchangeable parts in a vast bureaucracy where the skills of reading, writing and arithmetic were key. He argues that today's world needs a new system in which the role of computers in aiding learning is paramount. TED.com: A Q&A with Sugata Mitra . To help speed learning, Mitra has recruited hundreds of ""grannies,"" volunteers from the United Kingdom, many of them retired teachers, who function more in the role of ""grandparents"" than teachers, skypeing into learning environments around the world, encouraging students to do their best and praising their achievements. With the TED Prize money, Mitra intends to build a laboratory, most likely in India, where he can test his theories through experiments that supplement schoolwork. He likens it to a ""safe cybercafe for children"" where they can strengthen their English skills, which can be a route to economic advancement. Mitra said he doesn't think teachers are obsolete but suggests their roles may be changing as students increasingly have access to self-learning through computers. And he argues that his self-organized teams may be an alternative to regular schools in places where teachers may not be available. Traditional education stresses tests and punishments, two things that Mitra said causes the brain to shut down its rational processes and surrender to fear. Adopting a method closer to that of grandparents, who shower children with admiration, is ""the opposite of the parent method,"" which relies on threats, Mitra said. Note: A version of this article was originally published on February 27, 2013.","Education expert Sugata Mitra received $1 million TED Prize .

"(CNN) -- Julie Hermann promised to help Rutgers' athletic program bounce back after an abuse scandal rattled the university and drew national attention. But now the woman tapped to turn around the troubled program is facing abuse allegations herself. Hermann's appointment as the school's athletic director came more than a month after a video of a Rutgers coach hurling basketballs and yelling homophobic slurs prompted the coach's firing, the resignation of the school's athletic director and sharp criticism from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. ""It is a new day,"" Hermann told reporters on May 15. ""(The problem) is already fixed, and there is no one that doesn't agree about how we treat young people with respect and dignity and build trust."" But a group of former volleyball players said Hermann used a different approach when she coached them at the University of Tennessee in the 1990s: ""mental cruelty."" In a letter written in 1997 and obtained by the The Star-Ledger newspaper, members of the team purportedly claimed that Hermann called players ""whores, alcoholics and learning disabled."" Verbal abuse from Hermann became so intense, they claimed, that the team banded together to write the letter, calling the situation ""irreconcilable."" After the team presented the letter to Hermann, she chose to stop coaching them, according to the newspaper's report. In a written statement released Monday, Hermann said her former students' comments are ""heartbreaking."" She denied the allegations of abuse and vowed to push ahead in her new role. ""I was never notified of the reported letter outlining the concerns of some former athletes. However, I am truly sorry that some were disappointed during my tenure as coach,"" she said. ""For sure, I was an intense coach, but there is a vast difference between high intensity and abusive behavior."" Hermann said her commitment to students' success has been firm throughout her career. ""Over the years, I have tried to learn from each mistake, including the lessons I learned as a young coach,"" she said. ""I have become a stronger leader, administrator, and educator as a result. If you look at my 25-year career in athletics, I believe the record shows I am a steadfast advocate for student athletes. I intend to take that passion and hard-earned experience into my leadership role as athletic director of Rutgers University."" Rutgers University President Robert l. Barchi said Monday that he stands by the school's choice. ""Rutgers was deliberative at every stage of this process,"" he said in a written statement. ""Over the course of the search, Julie's record established her as a proven leader in athletics administration with a strong commitment to academic success as well as athletic excellence, and a strong commitment to the well-being of student athletes."" Word that Rutgers picked Hermann to turn around the school's athletic program after an abuse scandal came as a surprise to Kim Obiala, one of the players who said she wrote the letter about her coaching in 1997. ""I think my first reaction was, 'Hey, isn't that ironic?' Of all the people that they can hire, (they pick) someone who's actually done that kind of thing to me and to others,"" Obiala told CNN's ""Starting Point"" on Monday. ""Over the years, she might have changed and learned her lesson. Back then, she was a similar coach."" Players whom Hermann coached were pushed to a breaking point, Obiala said. ""You have to keep it on the court. Once you attack someone outside the court, where you're attacking their personality, who they are as a person, that's where you've crossed the line. There's no reason for that,"" she said. ""I've definitely had such tough coaches that have pushed me beyond my physical limits. But this was more mental and psychological."" A University of Tennessee spokeswoman declined to comment. The abuse allegations once again drew the attention of New Jersey's governor. ""He's not going to make any judgments at this time, but he expects to be talking with the Rutgers administration this week to get the details,"" said Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Christie. Another allegation from Hermann's past came up at a news conference after Rutgers announced her hiring. In 1997, a jury awarded $150,000 to a former Tennessee assistant coach who claimed that she was fired because she was pregnant. To make her case, the former assistant coach, Ginger Hineline, gave a copy of her wedding video to The Star-Ledger. ""I hope it's good tonight,"" Hermann, then a bridesmaid at the wedding, says in the video. ""Because I know you've been waiting for a while, but I hope it's not too good, because I don't want you to come back February with any surprises, you know, the office and all, and it would be hard to have a baby in there."" Asked about the video at a news conference this month, Hermann appeared taken aback. ""There's a video?"" she asked. ""I'm sorry, did you say there's a video? There's no video, trust me."" According to The Star-Ledger report, Hermann told the newspaper that Hineline was fired because of performance issues. She told the newspaper she could not recall attending Hineline's wedding and said that because she was a witness at the 1997 trial, she would not have been permitted in the courtroom when the wedding video was played. ""On the matter of the litigation, that issue was addressed many years ago and was known to Rutgers. I am sorry for the confusion I created by misspeaking about the existence of a video tape,"" Hermann said Monday. ""It was recorded nearly 20 years ago and I simply did not recall the video tape until I saw it in media reports."" Obiala told CNN that she and her former teammates aren't trying to create problems for Hermann. ""We weren't trying to cause any waves. Honestly, I don't think any of us expected it to get to this point,"" she said. ""Hopefully, at this point Julie's changed, and she's realized what a program needs."" The former players, Obiala said, have moved forward. ""Once the (athletic) department acknowledged our letter and gave us the opportunity to speak with her, and she chose not to coach for us anymore, we all accepted it. We said our piece. We've moved on,"" she said. ""We're moms, we're career women, and we're happy."" CNN's Jason Kessler, Laura Dolan and Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","NEW: Hermann: ""There is a vast difference between high intensity and abusive behavior""

"(CNN) -- Why do we love gangsters -- at least the ones on TV and in the movies? The sudden death of actor James Gandolfini at age 51 has brought a round of instant nostalgia for the HBO show he led at the turn of the millennium, ""The Sopranos."" It helped define the time for people living it, stretching between the excesses of the Clinton years and the grim patriotic grit of the post-9/11 period. There was very little admirable about the character of Tony Soprano -- most of us don't murder on our lunch break -- and yet he became a kind of elevated everyman. From the commute home to New Jersey shown in the opening credits -- over the techno-blues of Alabama 3's ""Woke Up This Morning (And Got Myself a Gun)"" -- to Tony's constant struggles to keep in control at work, this was a violent fantasy for middle-aged managers who want respect. Opinion: Gandolfini's gift to television -- and America . A half-century ago, cowboys and Indians were the quintessential American set piece for TV and film. The pioneer life was still within living memory. But since at least the 1970s, with Francis Ford Coppola's ""Godfather"" films, the Mafia has become our central media metaphor. We are a nation of people who live in and around cities, more the descendants of immigrants than Western pioneers. The struggle is less for settling land and taming wilderness than it is for money and respect and defense of our family. The goal is getting ahead and living the good life. Gangster fantasies also undercut the old adage that there is no honor among thieves. While the Sopranos crew was often a rolling disaster of violent incompetence, Tony was the flawed moral anchor of the Mafia family, trying to instill some values even while acknowledging (reluctantly, in private) his own hypocrisy and contradictions. What made ""The Sopranos"" different from the boatload of Mafia shows that came before it was that Tony was in therapy. The sight of a mobster having an anxiety attack and suffering through psychotherapy was the central conceit of the show, the selling point of the pilot episode that led to the six-season series. But if ""talking about your feelings"" seemed like the least masculine thing you could do, here too Tony represented the plight of the modern American male, reconciling his animal instincts with polite society. Therapy is where strong silent types get sent to be civilized. Appreciation: James Gandolfini, a pure actor . Good luck. Part of the appeal of the show was the fantasy of being able to vent frustrations violently. ""The Sopranos"" was the anti-""Seinfeld."" While Jerry and crew fixated on the small annoyances of daily life from the perspective of Manhattan's Upper West Side, Tony and his crew reacted to the small frustrations of daily life with violence over in New Jersey, punishing the pretentious, dishonest and arrogant with vicious beat-downs and more than a few bullets to the chest. They weren't going to be anyone's nominee for civic leader, and yet the guilty pleasure came from watching oversensitive thugs refuse to take any crap from anybody. For middle-aged men, I always suspected that part of the appeal of Tony Soprano was the archetype he provided that fat men, who eat and drink and smoke too much, can be recognized as central figures rather than side characters. Overburdened with work and the weight that comes with too many good times under his belt, Tony was the patriarch who demanded respect and ultimately received it. He was oversexed and had what might be described as Old World notions of fidelity, despite his appearance, because ""power is the ultimate aphrodisiac"" -- and yes, I just quoted Henry Kissinger in a column about Tony Soprano. Tony Soprano's best quotes . All of which is to say that Tony Soprano was not admirable, but was an eminently relatable figure for men who wrestle with the competing pressures of raising a family, running a business and being a man. He provided validation for their own mistakes and made them look good by comparison. When they struggled with their children, the disrespect Tony endured from his two kids made the domestic seem dramatic. When the average guys' own dim-witted bosses, for whom they do all the day-to-day work, tried to undercut them, Tony's struggles with Uncle Junior (who tries to have him killed) made their own frustrations seem manageable. In the end, having a Mafia show be a metaphor for daily life doesn't exactly reflect a country living up to its best traditions. But then the gap between fiction and reality is always stark, especially in the rearview mirror. Tony Soprano mattered to so many people because his struggles were their own, writ large, and he could take decisive actions to demand respect for himself and his family that they could only fantasize about, trying to maintain control and impose something like sanity on all the constantly moving craziness that surrounds us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: After cowboys and Indians, mafia became our central media metaphor .

"(CNN) -- The fiery South Carolina congressional special election between former Gov. Mark Sanford and Elizabeth Colbert Busch is attracting national attention -- but not for the reasons it should. Listening to much of the national coverage, it can sound like a race between Jenny Sanford -- the ex-wife of the ex-governor -- and comedian Stephen Colbert, the brother of the Democratic candidate. But the real news is that a Democrat could win the 1st Congressional District in South Carolina, reversing Republican control of the seat since 1981. Polls show Colbert Busch ahead and her confident debate performance on Monday night helped solidify the sense that momentum is behind her campaign. Subsequent endorsements of Sanford by Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, who unhelpfully praised him as a ""sexual pioneer,"" and a billboard put up by the odious adultery website Ashley Madison did nothing to help this would-be comeback kid. It is too early to count Sanford out, despite some liberal pundits declaring the race all but over. The coastal 1st District still has a 20% Republican registration advantage, and Sanford has never lost an election. But if Colbert Busch does win, it should shake up the lazy partisan assumptions that underlie our politics. That's because the result will not just be a referendum on Sanford but would also be a reflection of changing demographics in South Carolina and throughout the South. The idea that Texas, rich in Electoral College votes, could turn into a swing state has preoccupied pundits in recent weeks because it would upend presidential electoral math. A win by Colbert Busch in South Carolina wouldn't have equal implications, but it could be a canary in the coalmine. And a close analysis of how her campaign defied the odds would be required reading for any Southern Democrats. First, consider that Charleston County -- the heart of the 1st Congressional District -- voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. Urban centers in the South have been trending more Democratic in recent years, buoyed not just by the black vote but younger voters -- including students and Northern transplants who move South for the improved quality of life. In fact, the 1st District of South Carolina is only 21% rural, according to U.S. Census statistics published in the Almanac of American Politics. Most significantly, the population has grown 28% since 2000. This because of a Southern resurgence and a growth in local businesses, especially manufacturing -- thanks largely to the fact that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. (Colbert-Busch, who is also running on the Working Families Party line, proclaimed herself ""proud to live in a right to work state during the debate). The takeaway here is that the old assumptions about a monochrome conservative electorate don't apply in coastal areas of South Carolina. This creates an opening for a centrist Democrat to win, especially against a polarizing Republican. And that is precisely the card that Colbert Busch has tried to play throughout the campaign, presenting herself as a ""tough, independent businesswoman"" who will try to find common ground in Congress. During the contentious debate at the Citadel on Monday, a well-coached Colbert Busch repeatedly tried to distance herself from liberal positions and then seize the center. ""Obamacare is extremely problematic"" she declared, expressing concerns about unintended costs and then pivoting to praise popular provisions such as an end to the exclusion of people with pre-existing conditions and the allowance for children to stay on their parents' health care plans until 26. She proclaimed herself ""a really proud defender of the Second Amendment"" and then worked her way to saying she would have voted for the universal background check bill. Likewise, when she endorsed immigration reform, she framed it as a plan backed by the Chamber of Commerce and the state's senior senator, Lindsey Graham. Even her most forthrightly liberal position, support for marriage equality, was explained by a quote from Dick Cheney -- ""freedom means freedom for everyone."" And when she was asked about abortion, she responded with a classic poll-tested Bill Clinton formulation -- it is a difficult personal choice that should be made between ""a woman, her family, her doctor and her God."" Sanford's repeated tactic was to try and essentially deny her attempt at seizing the center by connecting her to Nancy Pelosi and labor unions. (Full disclosure: I hosted the debate, which was sponsored by Patch.com and South Carolina Radio Network.) But there are a few lessons. First, centrist Democrats can get elected in South. This has been made more difficult in recent years because the Blue Dog tribe has been hunted into near-extinction, thanks largely to the rigged system of redistricting. In the case of South Carolina's 1st District, that meant that the largely African-American neighborhood of North Charleston was added to the neighboring district of James Clyburn, the state's sole Democratic congressional representative, who won re-election in 2012, virtually unchallenged. Democrats increase their competitiveness not by simply playing to the base, but reaching out to the center -- showing that they are committed to solving problems as well as being guided by core principles. Throughout the debate, Colbert Busch stuck studiously to that script, presenting herself an a independent-minded moderate who can help change the tone in Washington, contrasting with Republicans' increasing reputation for being too inflexible and uncompromising. ""We have got to come to the middle;"" she pleaded. ""We have got to be reasonable"" Second, demographics are destiny and even the Solid South is subject to change. Diversity is on the increase, but almost more significantly is the population growth -- families moving to the South from other parts of the country in search of an improved quality of life and job opportunities. The growth of Southern cities also changes the political calculus because cities usually are less conservative than rural areas. Finally, the competitiveness of this race even in a district with a 20-point Republican registration advantage shows that citizens are willing to vote for the person and not the party if they are given a compelling candidate and contrast. All of which is to say that Republicans who believe that they will inevitably win back the seat in 2014 might be mistaken. Regardless of who wins the May 7 special election -- and, again, Sanford shouldn't be counted out -- the real winners are already the residents of the coastal South Carolina. Competitive congressional elections are increasingly rare in an age of redistricting-enforced one-party rule. But when everyone's vote matters in a general election, it is a win for democracy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Media emphasizing Jenny Sanford and Stephen Colbert in special election .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the nation celebrated the start of another term for President Barack Obama, Republican congressional leaders had a muted, bipartisan response to his second inaugural address. Obama's speech ties current issues to founding principles . ""Today is a day for all of us in this country to come together,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN, when asked about the president's speech. ""It really doesn't matter who you voted for, which side you're on,"" Cantor added. ""Today is a day we can all come together."" Cantor said the president's speech addressed the issue of upward mobility, a topic of shared concern across party lines. Transcript: Read Obama's second inaugural address . When asked about online reaction to the speech from Republicans who felt it was too aggressive and too liberal, Cantor again refused to engage in partisan terms. Opinion Roundup: Obama's ringing defense of liberalism . ""I think the president did a fine job certainly laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country,"" the second-highest ranking Republican leader in the House said. ""There are plenty of areas of disagreement but there are also some things that, fundamentally, we agree on -- and that is this country is one of opportunity,"" he continued. Cantor added that there were partisan differences over ""the way we get there to help everybody. ... Hopefully, we can bridge those differences."" Cantor's remarks echoed a sentiment shared by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a written statement issued as Monday's ceremony at the Capitol was beginning to wrap up. ""Every four years on Inauguration Day, America shows the world that our major political parties can disagree with civility and mutual respect,"" McConnell wrote. The Senate's top Republican said Obama's second term represented a ""fresh start"" for addressing big challenges facing the country, including the issues of federal spending and debt. ""Republicans are eager to work with the president on achieving this common goal and we firmly believe that divided government provides the perfect opportunity to do so. Together, there is much we can achieve."" Obama, near the end of his inaugural address on Monday, made what appeared to be an oblique reference to the partisan battles between himself, the GOP-controlled House and the Senate -- where Democrats have control but do not have a filibuster-proof majority. Boehner faces own challenges as Obama's second term begins . House GOP to vote on three-month extension of debt ceiling . ""Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness,"" the president said to the nearly one million people gathered along the National Mall. ""Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time -- but it does require us to act in our time. ""For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that today's victories will be only partial, and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years, and forty years, and four hundred years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall."" Obama added that ""the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction -- and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service."" Asked about what occurred during Monday's lunch attended by the president and some members of Congress, Cantor said, ""It's a very nice lunch. It is really a continuum of the spirit of the day where both sides come together. There's bipartisan representation at the tables. There's legislative branch, judicial branch, executive branch all sharing tables. And just nothing but good. Hopefully that kind of cooperative spirit can continue."" Cantor said part of the reason the luncheon ran long was because Obama ""went to every table and shook every hand."" CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Cantor how long the bipartisan spirit and goodwill of Inauguration Day will linger. ""We hope that this lasts,"" Cantor said, ""and then that we can focus on solutions, bridging differences, setting aside differences and trying to focus on what we have in common as Americans.""","House Majority Leader Eric Cantor: ""Today is a day for all of us in this country to come together""

"New York (CNN) -- Forget Punxsutawney Phil's predictions. The words ""Play ball!"" are the most dependable sign that spring has arrived in America.Â Finally, baseball season is here. Maybe because it is an outdoor game, with a schedule stretching across three seasons.Â Maybe because it is a child's game played by men, bridging the different times of our lives.Â But the start of the baseball season is always greeted with relief, a sign of rebirth and hope, that this year appropriately coincides with Easter. Winter is over.Â The bleak time has been survived.Â And slowly but soon the familiar rhythms of life will reassert themselves. This, as it's referred to in the film ""Bull Durham,"" is the church of baseball, open to all. It is a sport more appropriately known as a pastime, ""the national pastime."" The pace of the game is part of its charm -- meditation and strategy interspersed with furious action.Â The sounds of the game are the background track to summer. As a sport played without a clock, a baseball game occurs out of time. It could theoretically go on forever. The past is always present in baseball -- it is ""a haunted game,"" as Ken Burns' documentary ""Baseball"" intones, with typically perfect pitch.Â The best players of today compete not just with the players in their league, but the best players of all time.Â Statistics are the unlikely portal to this bit of metaphysics. Fans can compare players of different eras and dream up their own all-time all-star team. This is another reason to love the game: Baseball can inspire young fans to see the fun in math and history. I am a Yankees fan, first minted in 1979, looking up at a poster of Ron Guidry, Willie Randolph and Greg Nettles -- meaning that I waited 17 years to see them return to World Series-winning form. It was a case of bad timing:Â  I stayed true when just about everyone my age in New York was rooting for the Mets in their championship 1986 season.Â This takes not quite as much character as remaining a Chicago Cubs fan, but it's somewhere in the same ballpark. Now with the Yankee players of the legendary late 1990s teams reaching the twilight of their careers, I am not expecting to win our division this year, let alone see the World Series. But with the start of the new season, a blank slate in front of us, the possibility exists, and that in itself is liberating. As much as I love the Yankees, I love the game of baseball more. Which is why I always harbor a secret hope on opening day that the long-suffering Cubs fans will finally get to see a World Series win in their antique jewel of a ballpark, Wrigley Field.Â  I want to see baseball tradition and fan faith rewarded.Â  Even when the Yankees' archrivals, the Boston Red Sox, won their 2004 World Series after 86 years of waiting, I quietly cheered, because New England fans had waited long enough and deserved some deliverance. The love of the game comes first. These are a fan's notes before opening day, a rambling love letter to a game that still surprises me with how much I miss it in the offseason.Â  None of these thoughts or emotions is entirely original, but they are from the heart. The church of baseball has many hymns, from Ken Burns' epic ""Baseball,"" to films like ""The Natural"" and ""Field of Dreams,"" to books like ""The Boys of Summer."" Sports columnists like Red Smith, Jim Murray and Shirley Povich captured enduring moments in the newspapers of their day. But the finest tribute, to my eyes and ears, came from the typewriter of Bart Giamatti, the one-time president of Yale and Red Sox fan, who died of a heart attack at the age of 51, just 154 days into his tenure as the commissioner of baseball: ""It is designed to break your heart,"" he wrote. ""The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone."" But this is the beginning of the season.Â The knowledge that ""this too will pass"" takes away none of the thrill that comes with new beginnings.Â There are green outfields and long summer days ahead of us. The story of this season is about to be written and we will all get to be witnesses.Â Finally.Â Again.

"(CNN) -- ""You guys are crack addicts."" That was Jeb Bush on ""Meet the Press,"" addressing journalists about their obsession with the 2016 presidential campaign, more than three years away. The former Florida governor was joking and it's a fool's errand for anyone in the media to pretend to be offended. But as always, humor contains a kernel of truth. Although the press corps isn't collectively hitting the glass pipe, we are more than a little obsessive-compulsive when it comes to talking about the next election. After all, the last presidential election just ended four months ago. The midterm elections are still 18 months away. This is the time for governing -- that rare sweet spot in a two-term administration where Congress is not paralyzed by the immediate prospect of re-election and the president has maximum political capital to spend on the priorities that define a legacy. There is plenty of political drama to go around -- the sequester cuts kicking in, a full court press for a grand bargain in the face of another debt ceiling debacle, a budget battle, the most heated gun control debate in two decades and the first real chance at a bipartisan immigration overhaul in more than a generation. And that's just the looming legislative agenda in addition to the internecine fights on Capitol Hill. But budget fights make us sleepy and even the prospect of national default feels a little like Groundhog Day. Overall, we don't really pay attention to scandals unless sex is involved, no matter how much money or honor is stolen. Instead we reflexively fast forward to the next election, looking for a quick fix -- a race that allows us to talk about the comparatively simple world of winners and losers. The media does a great job covering campaigns but no so much when it comes to covering governing. In the process, we almost forget that governing is the main event -- the prize that all those candidates strive for in the campaign. There's plenty of collusion. Jeb Bush isn't innocent -- he trotted out to every Sunday show to promote his new book with Clint Bolick on immigration, knowing that the widespread interest was driven by speculation about a 2016 presidential campaign. Moreover, with the merciless metrics of journalism in the Internet age, editors know that stories on the sequester don't have the same clickability rate as sex scandals, murders and celebrity gossip. I have no problem with a high-low approach to story selection, and I'm not immune from writing about future elections. But there's an obligation to focus primarily on current events, aiming to educate as we entertain. Otherwise, our country starts hurtling toward a world of bread and circuses instead of inspiring the kind of active citizenry that democracy ultimately depends upon. I'm not trying to idolize a fictitious journalistic past, where newspapers, radio and television focused solely on civic substance rather than sensationalism. And although the rise of partisan media has fueled distrust of journalism and segregates people into separate political realities, the deeper bias at work in media is not necessarily liberal or conservative. It's more a conflict bias that steers us toward covering the horse race of campaigning rather than the legislative sausage-making that comes with governing. The best television journalists and Washington columnists -- from Edward R. Murrow and Walter Lippmann to Mary McGrory and Tim Russert -- were able to communicate the drama of decision-making by people temporarily in power and even help elevate the outcome by harnessing the weight of public opinion. The everyday challenge of journalism is to entertain while we educate. And that requires focusing on present challenges rather than just projecting far into the future to the next election, imagining a simpler time when all problems will be solved by a change in power. Crack addict? Not exactly. But like an addict, we are always lurching toward the next fix, dragging national debate along with us. It's time to sober up and focus on the drama-fueled main event happening right in front of us. We might even help fix a few problems by infusing the process of solving them with a sense of civic urgency. instead of defaulting to speculation about the next election. It's not easy, but then very little worthwhile in life is. As George Orwell once wrote, ""To see what is in front of one's nose needs a constant struggle.""

"(CNN) -- ""What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick it any further. ... We have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch, not someone else's."" So said President-elect Barack Obama at a Washington Post editorial board meeting in January 2009, just days before taking his first oath of office. He was talking about the importance of dealing with the long-term deficit and debt. The rhetoric hasn't met the record -- debt has exploded under Obama's watch. Reasonable people can forgive the president for expenses incurred while confronting the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression -- and, let's be honest, alternative paths of austerity have not worked that well across the Atlantic. But now is the time to get serious about reigning in our long-term debt, which now exceeds an unsustainable 70% of gross domestic product. At this moment of maximum political capital, Obama is perfectly positioned to act on his original impulse in the State of the Union on Tuesday night. But there is a dangerous bit of hubris sweeping the Democratic Party, which says that dealing with deficits and debt is a sucker's bet, best left to the next Republican president. Instead, the Keynesians are riding high and arguing that deficit and debt is not a primary concern to most voters and irrelevant to economic growth. And so the pregame expectation setting comes: White House minions told The Washington Post not to expect the president to present ""an ambitious new plan to rein in the debt"" in the State of the Union. Opinion: Obama needs to lay out a plan on climate crisis . This would be a major mistake and a costly lost opportunity. With an eye toward his legacy, Obama should follow his original instincts and put the power of presidency behind a balanced long-term plan to deal with deficits and debt -- including spending cuts, tax reform and, most importantly, entitlement reform. This is the time for Obama to pull a Nixon in China. Just as only a committed anti-communist such as Nixon could establish relations with communist China, Obama is perfectly positioned to do what he knows is necessary to preserve the long-term strength and solvency of the social safety net: Medicare and Social Security. This does not mean draconian cuts or a voucherization of the existing system as imagined by Rep. Paul Ryan and many House Republicans. But it does mean following through on the president's previous negotiated offers to consider ""chained CPI,"" which would lower inflation-related increases in Social Security benefits, and to raise the eligibility age for Medicare. Formula adjustments such as these can save billions of dollars over the next 10 years, keeping these popular programs solvent. Other solutions, such as raising the Social Security payroll tax cap to more than the current income cutoff of $110,000, are worth consideration as part of a package. This is an idea that liberals love because it extends the progressivity of the tax code to the wealthiest Americans. Alternatively, we could means-test Social Security to make sure it serves primarily as a safety net -- or (gasp!) raise the retirement age. When the Bowles-Simpson commission suggested raising the retirement age to 69 in 2075, it was met with howls of outrage from unions in particular. This makes no sense, especially if common-sense exemptions are made for manual labor. Beltway cynics say that the bipartisan deficit and debt reduction plans that are often cited have no chance of passing Congress. When you look at the pathetic support for Bowles-Simpson when it was actually put to a vote in the House last March -- 16 Republicans and 22 Democrats supported it -- you see why cynicism is always a safe bet in Washington. But take a step back, and you'll see much broader support among the American people. The Pew Research Center found that the top three issues are ""strengthening the economy"" (at 86%), ""improving the jobs situation"" (79%) and ""reducing the budget deficit"" (at 72%). Crucially, the deficit has shown the biggest increase as an issue over the past four years -- up 19 percentage points from 2009. This is evidence of a pent-up demand for action -- but it will require presidential leadership. Of course the devil is in the details, and politicos will point out that when confronted with tough medicine to deal with deficits and debt, even alleged tea party supporters balk (hence the classic ""Government Get Your Hands Off My Medicare!"" sign that I saw at one 2009 rally). But strengthening America to remain competitive in the 21st century will require getting our long-term debt under control along with other important but less poll-prioritized policies such as comprehensive immigration reform and a public-private infrastructure bank to fund nation-building ""here at home."" The State of the Union is a chance for the president to put forward a balanced bipartisan solution that contrasts with radical conservatives who believe that increased tax revenues from closed tax loopholes can't be part of a big deal to bring down our debt. Wall Street lawyers will fight to protect every loophole they embedded in our tax code, but their argument doesn't begin to make sense to people on Main Street. Obama will probably point out Tuesday night that economic growth is the essential X Factor to reducing long-term deficits and debt. On this point at least, he and some conservatives might agree. But dumb meat cleaver cuts such as the looming sequestration could push our economy back into recession. That's why a smart balanced alternative plan is necessary. But it will require presidential leadership and putting some Democratic sacred cows on the table. This doesn't just make practical sense in a divided government (a reality some Democrats seem to forget) -- it makes compelling political sense as well. By seizing the mantle of fiscal responsibility -- in contrast to fiscal conservatism -- Obama will build on his post-election bump among centrists and some independents. The more Machiavellian Democrats might argue that this outreach could only serve to isolate Republicans more. Nonpartisan strategists might argue that this approach would drive a wedge between reasonable Republicans and the House radicals. But the real reason for Obama to address the need to reduce long-term deficits and debt directly is because it's the right thing to do for our country -- and he is uniquely positioned to achieve it. Just as Nixon could go to China, a Southern Democrat such as Lyndon Johnson was needed to pass civil rights legislation and Bill Clinton was able to sign welfare reform after decades of Republicans talking about it, Obama can put our country on a balanced path of long-term economic growth and fiscal responsibility. Bottom line: Obama has the political opportunity, but does he have the political will? We'll all find out in real time if he decides to lead on this issue or just be the latest in a long line to kick the can further down the road. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: President Barack Obama is well-positioned to help solve debt problem .

"(CNN) -- You would click on the link, and there you'd find the Tea Party Patriots' mailer, calling for liberty and asking for money, decrying ""big-government Republicans"" and ""leftist Obama Democrats"" alike. But the real target of this particular pitch was none other than Karl Rove himself, the ""architect"" of George W. Bush's two White House wins, accused in the ad of trying to ""crush the Tea Party movement."" And he was depicted as a Nazi. Photoshopped into the uniformed visage of vicious SS commandant Heinrich Himmler, no less -- the architect of the Holocaust. It's hard to imagine a more offensive piece of political e-mail. Not surprisingly, within hours, the e-mail was retracted and apologies offered all around. It was a terrible case of mistaken identity, an inexplicable bit of human error, the Tea Party Patriots said through a high-priced PR agent when called by Politico's Ken Vogel, who broke the story. The Virginia-based political fundraising firm, Active Engagement, promptly fell on its sword, which is the decent thing to do when you've been paid $1.5 million and screw up this definitively. The tea party's impulse to attack Rove personally -- so deeply felt that putting an SS uniform on him seemed like a good idea to somebody in the chain of command -- is a sign of just how bitter this GOP civil war is becoming. Rove's alleged sin is the formation of a group dedicated to nominating electable congressional candidates for the GOP. It seems that some folks in ""the establishment"" don't like losing Senate races every year because the partisan primary system keeps kicking up extreme candidates who are beloved by the hyperpartisan base but can't win in a general election. Cases in point: Senate candidates Sharron Angle, Ken Buck and Christine (""I am not a witch"") O'Donnell in 2010; the no-abortion-even-in-cases-of-rape duo Richard Mourdock and Todd Aiken in 2012. If those five tea party favorites hadn't imploded in spectacular fashion, Republicans could be in control of the Senate right now. So Rove & Co. are backing more centrist Republican candidates who they think have a chance. Borger: Obama can't kick his legacy down the road . The midterms are 18 months away, but the fault lines are already forming. Two states -- Georgia and Iowa -- appear primed to put forward the next Angle and Aiken in the form of two right-wing congressmen: Paul Broun and Steve King. It turns out that Broun has a bit of a Nazi-calling problem himself. Days after Barack Obama's first election in 2008, Broun was first out of the gate on this ugly front, comparing the president-elect to Hitler. In his apology, Broun tortuously explained that ""I'm just trying to bring attention to the fact that we may -- may not, I hope not -- but we may have a problem with that type of philosophy of radical socialism or Marxism."" In recent years, Broun has become best known for proclaiming evolution and the big-bang theory ""lies from the pit of hell"" and asserting his belief that the Earth is 9,000 years old. Despite these and many other slips into the fringe, Broun was uncontested in his most recent election and serves on the House Science Committee. If he is the GOP nominee, Democrats could have a chance at winning the Georgia Senate seat for the first time since Max Cleland. Likewise, Iowa congressman Steve King is the proud father of a steady stream of hyperpartisan howlers, beginning in the 2008 election, when he predicted that if Obama were elected, ""The radical Islamists, the al Qaeda ... would be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11, because they would declare victory in this war on terror."" When the McCain campaign sensibly disavowed his statements, King pushed back and said terrorists would view Obama as their ""savior"" and ""That's why you will see them supporting him, encouraging him."" Tell that to Osama bin Laden. In recent years, King has been the lone ""no"" vote on a congressional resolution apologizing for the use of slaves in building the U.S. Capitol, supported deporting ""anchor babies"" and, yes, defended Akin's campaign comments by saying he hadn't heard of any young woman getting pregnant from rape or incest. You see pretty quickly where this campaign is likely to go in a swing state that voted for Obama twice. LZ Granderson: Rubio missed the year of the woman . Nonetheless, Broun has thrown his hat in the ring, and polls show King a favorite among rank-and-file conservatives in Iowa. Hence Rove's group, getting ready to do some reverse RINO-hunting of its own with a spinoff of the Crossroads super PAC. It's called ""The Conservative Victory Project."" I appreciate how tea party groups might howl when the outside money is directed against them, but a taste of your own medicine is sometimes morally clarifying. In a larger sense, this family feud is fascinating for several reasons. It represents a realization by Rove -- the father of the ""red state vs. blue state,"" ""play to the base"" strategy -- that there is such a thing as too extreme. Some of the forces that the Republican establishment encouraged when its self-righteous hate was directed against Obama have found that venom can be directed at them. In this same vein, House Speaker John Boehner has found that 50 or so tea party radicals are his biggest problem in governing; they are quick to undercut him and eager to gamble with the full faith and credit of the United State. Golem always turns on its creator. In the end, the Republican Party does need to reform. It needs to rebuild the big tent and reach out beyond its base. It needs to stop coddling the angry and unhinged in its ranks. And it needs to become more philosophically consistent when it comes to advancing individual freedom as well as fiscal responsibility. Count me with Karl Rove and Co. -- in at least this one case. The Tea Party Patriots' misfired e-mail was an ugly tell, a reminder that angry conservative populist passions can transform into a mob mentality. Extremes are always ultimately their own side's worst enemy.

"(CNN) -- With a crop of political movies in the Oscar running, this weekend Hollywood is looking more like Poliwood. Best Picture contenders such as ""Argo,"" ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Lincoln"" have managed to pay off at the box office even as they brought politics and history to the big screen -- proof that we'll take smart over stupid as long as we're entertained while educated. But what's really notable about these films is that for the most part they avoid hagiography. They dare to show complexity. This doesn't mean indulging in moral relativism; evil exists and these films acknowledge it. But the human dimension is kept intact rather, with characters not divided into simply angels versus devils. The real tradeoffs behind difficult decisions are acknowledged, consistent with the idea that the truth is never pure and rarely simple. In ""Argo,"" the CIA agents are far from James Bond clones. Suited up in 1970s regalia, Ben Affleck's disheveled character is separated from his wife and child. He quaffs wine and chows down on McDonald's, and is outclassed by Hollywood producers cooperating in the creation of the fake film that provides cover for an escape of embassy personnel from Iran. The film doesn't blink at the brutal mob mentality of revolutionary Islamist radicals, but it also takes time to explain the vicious cycle that began when the CIA helped topple and democratically elected Mohammed Mossaddegh and replaced him with the shah. The Carter White House is depicted as well-intentioned and principled but not exactly a crackerjack All-Star Team. Likewise, the Navy SEALs who kill Osama bin Laden in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" are disciplined in their work but not portrayed as anything resembling perfect in their personal lives. The lead CIA agent, Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, is a mess outside the narrow confines of her work. She is obsessive, bullying and intolerant but sharply intelligent. Her initial moral qualms over torture are quickly replaced by a cold determination to do whatever it takes. Obeidallah: Oscars don't matter . But perhaps the best example of this human realism this Oscar season is Daniel Day-Lewis' definitive film portrayal of President Abraham Lincoln. He is not portrayed as a stovepipe-hat-wearing saint, but a prairie politician -- a flawed man and a wounded giant. He wrestles with depression, slaps his eldest son and yells at his wife when she overindulges in histrionics over the death of a younger son. Lewis' Lincoln buoys his darker moods by telling meandering jokes that amuse him more than the listeners, infuriating his secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, in the process. He is thought to be a fool by some and a despot by others. But above all, he is skilled in the art of power and strategic in its deployment. Lincoln stretches the limits of law and ethics to cobble together enough votes for the passage of the 13th Amendment. Congressmen are bribed and cajoled with the promise of lucrative new jobs. Threats are made and some principles abandoned in the cause of building a broader coalition. Lincoln lies to Congress about the status of secret peace talks with the Confederacy. He alone, at times, keeps in mind the larger goal of bending history toward justice, against the cruel backdrop of escalating body counts. The best metaphor for the movie's more realistic viewpoint is Lincoln's voice. It has often been described by biographers as high-pitched with a Kentucky accent, and this was difficult to reconcile with the grave baritone we associate with the man reading the Gettysburg Address. But Daniel Day-Lewis did the research like Alan Lomax on a field recording and he came back with a voice that matches the biographical descriptions -- hard to imagine but instantly recognizable when finally heard. This Lincoln takes the risk of authenticity and takes the man off his pedestal, becoming somehow bigger for it. And that's a healthy trend for movies overall. Opinion: With Lincoln, a new frontier for Day-Lewis . Lastly, one the Academy missed: In an unjustly Oscar-ignored presidential portrayal, Bill Murray channeled FDR in ""Hyde Park on Hudson,"" showing the four-term president as a charming man in need. Buoyant amid stormy weather, Murray's FDR is comfortable with maintaining multiple layers of deceit with those closest to him. This is capped off by intermingling romantic affairs that occasionally explode out into the open. It's a reminder that great and good can be very different qualities, doled out in different amounts at different times, sometimes within the same person. The lesson? You don't have to be perfect to be a hero. And imperfections can actually add to heroism by virtue of authenticity. Hollywood's new take on politics and history invigorates because it does not hero-worship or whitewash. By risking realism, exposing flaws as well as moments of greatness, the inspiration of these characters becomes more accessible to us all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: A new take on politics and realism in this year's Oscar crop. Call it ""Poliwood""

"New York (CNN) -- There are days when Congress seems determined to earn its 12% approval rating -- and that 14 Republican senators are threatening to filibuster any new gun legislation should make your blood boil if you still have a heart to pump it with. Four months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School slaughter, the vast majority of Americans still support some sensible new gun laws, but the same legislation has been declared DOA by conservative senators. It's enough for some activists to crow that the NRA's strategy to stall until public attention moved elsewhere has succeeded. The old argument after a mass shooting -- ""it's too soon"" -- has been revealed to be the delay and dodge it always was. In a democracy, the will of the people is supposed to have some sway. And an astounding 91% of Americans back universal background checks -- including 88% of Republicans, according to a Quinnipiac poll. Reality check: 90% of Americans don't agree on the awesomeness of apple pie and vanilla ice cream. The disconnect between Congress and Main Street America has rarely been so stark. This should be a no-brainer -- especially because the most ""controversial"" initial proposals have been dropped because they were considered too politically difficult to pass. Those included a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban, which is only supported by a narrow majority of the American people, and a limit on high-capacity magazines . Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was hotly criticized by liberals for backing off this proposal, but he cited pragmatism -- the need to get 60 votes for passage. That Reid himself has enjoyed high ratings from the NRA and is looking out for the political fortunes of red state Democrats running for re-election was a source of some suspicion. But even Reid's attempt to put forward a less polarizing bill has been met by the threatened Republican filibuster. There seems to be no reward for being reasonable. Reid to force a vote Thursday on debating gun measures . When Rand Paul filibustered the nomination of CIA Director John Brennan, I cheered -- not because I agreed, but because it was a principled attempt to educate the American people on drone strike policy and because Paul pursued the filibuster the traditional ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" way, taking the Senate floor rather than blocking debate with a parliamentary maneuver. But this threatened filibuster on guns follows the old obscure obstructionist ways, blocking debate and accountability rather than encouraging it. The arguments would-be filibusterers such as Sens. Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Mitch McConnell and Mike Enzi are making sound as if they are principled -- if you don't pay attention to the facts. Here's Enzi's take: ""The measures proposed currently by the majority do not reduce crime, they simply restrict the American public's constitutional right to self-defense. ... These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and proponents won't stop with these restrictions."" Enzi is singing from the current conservative hymnal, but let's take a closer look. His statement is a combination of fictitious fear-mongering (""These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights"") and the dystopian slippery slope (""and proponents won't stop with these restrictions."") Let's start with a reality check on the most predictable of the oppositional bumper stickers: the ""assault on Second Amendment."" First, the Second Amendment is already enshrined in the Constitution. It cannot be abridged by legislation. Moreover, there exists the right to reasonable restrictions, such as the ban on machine guns that has existed in the USA since the 1930s and originally passed with NRA support. But don't take my word for it -- listen to conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote in the landmark Heller Decision, which declared D.C.'s functional ban on handguns unconstitutional: . ""Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. ""The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [United States v.] Miller's holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those 'in common use at the time' finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons."" Got that? Unless gun advocates are going to start calling Scalia a RINO (Republican In Name Only), there should be some room here for reasonable debate. Yes, we need to acknowledge that Americans use guns differently in urban and rural areas. That's one reason liberal former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean had an A rating from the NRA when he ran for president in 2004. But if politically difficult but clearly constitutional measures such as an assault weapons ban, which Ronald Reagan backed, aren't included in the proposed legislation, we surely should be able to debate this issue rationally and in the open. Republicans are doubling down on irrational appeals and trying to block debate. That's another reason this position is infuriatingly stupid -- it compounds the number one negative perception about the Republican Party. Namely, that it is ""inflexible and unwilling to compromise."" Why be afraid of an open debate and an up or down vote on this issue? Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani and John McCain have pointed out the counterproductive nature of this threatened filibuster, with McCain saying on CBS' ""Face the Nation"": ""The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand."" He added, sensibly: ""What are we afraid of?"" That's a good question. And the answer is hiding in plain sight. Republican senators are afraid of a conservative primary challenge fueled by huge amounts of outside money backed by activists and lobbying groups such as the NRA. I genuinely believe that both parties have good ideas and good people -- and principled voices are arguing for a constructive compromise and a real debate on this issue. Opponents can't even defend their inaction by arguing they are representing their constituents because of the overwhelming bipartisan margins for the proposed increased background checks and cracking down on gun-trafficking. But hyperpartisan politics are once again threatening to trump policy-driven problem solving. That's why Congress has such a dismal approval rating in the first place. On Tuesday and Wednesday, parents who lost children in the Newtown massacre will be walking the halls of Congress, trying to appeal to the conscience of our legislators. It will be interesting to see whether their personal appeals will carry as much weight as the influence of gun lobbyists. This issue isn't academic -- it is an urgent test of our elected representatives' ability to be responsive to the public will and reason together. If Newtown can't get Washington's attention, what will? The shooting of a colleague, Gabby Giffords, apparently didn't. Conscience and compassion should matter more than cold hard cash.

"(CNN) -- Sometimes it takes a tragedy to make us confront reality. In the wake of the slaughter of first graders in Newtown, Connecticut, there are signs that the country -- and Congress -- are ready to confront the cancer of gun violence that kills over 11,000 Americans each year. More than 200 Americans have been killed in mass shootings in the last five years. After each attack -- whether it was Virginia Tech or Aurora, Colorado -- we were told that it was too soon to talk about the role of guns. Now, the fever of denial might be breaking. A new Washington Post/ABC poll taken after the shooting shows that 54% of Americans now support stricter gun laws and 59% supportÂ a nationwide ban on high-capacity ammunition clips -- meaning those that contain more than 10 bullets. The big question of course is whether Congress will listen. This has not been an area where politicians have carved out a new chapter of profiles in courage in recent years. Instead, they have run away in the face of the lobbying power of the National Rifle Association. But in the past two days, two Southern Democratic senators with A-ratings from the NRA have broken ranks to say that it is time to begin a serious, civil and constructive conversation about remedies to mass gun violence -- including perhaps a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban and a restriction of high-capacity clips. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin -- who famously took aim at a cap and trade bill with a high-powered hunting rifle in a 2010 campaign ad -- told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the Newtown shooting ""changed me. ... I don't know of anybody that goes hunting with an assault rifle.Â I don't know people that need 10-, 20-, 30-round clips."" Add to this chorus of conscience Virginia Sen. Mark Warner -- a fellow former governor and current senator. He told a local Richmond TV station: ""I believe every American has 2ndÂ Amendment right -- the ability to hunt is part of our culture. I've had an NRA rating of an A. But you know, enough is enough. I'm a father of three daughters and this weekend they said, 'Dad, how can this go on?'"" These two senators are leaders of the centrist coalition, and their evolution on this issue matters. It is particularly well timed because Sen. Dianne Feinstein announced her intention to submit legislation to reinstate the lapsed assault weapons ban as well as ban ""big clips, drums or strips of more than 10 bullets."" That bill would provide the substantive basis for a new round of reasonable restrictions on weapons that have little purpose other than to kill as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. To date, there are few Republicans who have newly embraced the need for new gun legislation. Rep. Peter King of New York and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine are influential, but among the few returning congressional Republicans who back the reinstatement of the assault weapons ban and restrictions on the sale of mass capacity magazines. But the senators who have boasted the backing of the NRA in the past have been notably silent since the slaughter in Newtown. That can fairly be read as a hope that this moment will pass. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, has been leading the gun crusade in recent years through his group Mayors Against Illegal Guns. In many areas, America's mayors have been leading the policy debate in our nation, and this organization's message has taken on new urgency, unveiling an effort to encourage supporters to ""Demand a Plan"" from Washington. In the wake of the Newtown shootings, nine new mayors decided to join the group, including the mayors of Raleigh, North Carolina, and Tucson, Arizona -- major cities in the heart of gun country, the South and West. In this and so many other areas, the fact is that Americans are less polarized than our politicians. A poll commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns and conducted by conservative pollster Frank Luntz found that 74% of NRA members supported background checks on every gun sale. The larger point is that there is common ground to be found even on this emotional issue -- especially if mental health is part of the civic conversation, because self-control and gun control are intertwined. There is a responsibility to remember after events like this -- a need for sustained focus after the heat of the moment passes. Real change will require constructive civic conversation, the kind that Manchin noted has become rare, saying: ""It's a shame that we've gotten so toxic a political environment that today inÂ WashingtonÂ that you can't sit down and have reasonable discussions with reasonable people to come out to reasonable conclusions."" But there is a moral urgency to follow through on this moment. The normal politically convenient amnesia can't be allowed to set in. More senators need to be pressed on the issue of reasonable restrictions and prodded by the polls. Feinstein's proposed bill will no doubt start a substantive debate. As President Obama said in his memorial address in Newtown, ""No single law, no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. ... But that can't be an excuse for inaction."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: The horrific shootings in Newtown changed debate on guns .

"(CNN) -- Question: What do George Clooney, Chaka Khan, the American Medical Association, Bon Jovi and C. Everett Koop have in common? Answer: They are among the 500 names on the National Rifle Association's absurd new ""enemies list."" Richard Nixon would be embarrassed to find that his once sinister form of score-keeping has been revived so promiscuously by the NRA. But there is some redeeming social value here: The list illustrates an organization that has become hermetically sealed from society at large, so caught up in conservative debates that it has forgotten how to connect with Main Street America. The enemies list was first posted on the NRA's website in mid-September, hiding in plain sight under the banner ""National Organizations with Anti-Gun Policies."" But with the debate about reasonable gun restrictions reignited after the Sandy Hook Elementary School slaughter, the NRA's enemies list has become just the latest example of seriously bad judgment inside this once proud organization. Because whatever staffer was tasked with accumulating the list took the idea of ""you're either with us or against us"" so literally that everyone who isn't a card-carrying conservative seems to be counted as an enemy. The list is divided into broad categories, including ""Anti-Gun Individuals and Celebrities,"" journalists, civic organizations and corporations -- as well as a grab bag category that includes religious leaders. You don't have to be a charter member of Mensa to see how this is going to alienate far more Americans than it attracts. We're living in a celebrity-driven culture, for better or worse, so let's start with a look at the celebrity list. The first thing that struck me was the preponderance of '70s sitcom stars who are apparently among the leading threats to gun rights in America today, including Sandy Duncan, Marilu Henner, Ed Asner, Hal Linden and Pam Dawber of ""Mork & Mindy"" fame. It's like the list-maker was locked in a closet full of yellowing TV Guides. It's a near-miracle that ""The Partridge Family"" was left off the list. But the NRA doesn't seem content to limit its targets to old reruns of ""The Hollywood Squares"" -- no, it has to go and bring Sean Connery into the fight, along with Bruce Springsteen, Albert Brooks, Tony Bennett, Jack Nicholson, Britney Spears, Jerry Seinfeld and Oprah Winfrey. On the civic side, it sees fit to call out everyone from Dick Parsons to Maya Angelou to (the late) Ed Koch to Michael Eisner. You might as well declare yourself the sworn enemy of anyone who doesn't subscribe to National Review. This idea gets thrown into even sharper relief when you look at a partial list of civic, charitable and religious organizations that the NRA has determined are ""anti-gun."" Warning: Take a deep breath before reading aloud: . â¢ AARP; . â¢ AFL-CIO; . â¢ American Medical Association; . â¢ American Bar Association; . â¢ American Jewish Committee; . â¢ Anti-Defamation League; . â¢ B`nai B`rith; . â¢ Children`s Defense Fund; . â¢ Environmental Action Foundation; . â¢ Episcopal Church; . â¢ Lauder Foundation; . â¢ League of Women Voters of the United States; . â¢ National Association of Police Organizations; . â¢ National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; . â¢ National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; . â¢ National Council of La Raza; . â¢ National Urban League; . â¢ National Spinal Cord Injury Association; . â¢ Southern Christian Leadership Conference; . â¢ U.S. Catholic Conference; . â¢ United Methodist Church; . â¢ United Church of Christ; . â¢ U.S. Conference of Mayors; . â¢ and the YWCA of the USA. I ask this in all seriousness: Who's left? Because the list includes just about every major American faith group and denomination, every major ethnic group and voter constituency. And adding the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and National Spinal Cord Injury Association to the list of anti-gun enemies is either clueless or callous -- or both. One of my favorite lyrics by U2 says: ""Choose your enemies carefully, 'cause they will define you."" The NRA, like too much of the conservative movement, has chosen its enemies indiscriminately and seems defined in opposition to most of modern America. This is a byproduct of polarization, the cultlike expulsion of any dissenting voices and preoccupation with ideological purity. In the case of the NRA, this is reflected in its reversal on policies it supported in the past, such as gun-free school zones and universal background checks. But it is also reflected in tone-deaf speeches such as the ones recently delivered by Wayne LaPierre, or the truly out-of-touch television ad the NRA produced calling President Barack Obama an ""elitist hypocrite"" for having the Secret Service guard his two daughters at school. The essence of evangelism is winning converts -- but that goal can be easily forgotten when you're preoccupied with playing to the base. Reasonable advocates of Second Amendment rights are being ill-served by the organization's recalcitrant radicalism -- reflected in the fact that 74% of NRA members say they support universal background checks. Adding an indiscriminate enemies list to the NRA website only highlights its isolation, consolidating opposition among the figures mentioned and their fans. As legendary columnist Jimmy Breslin -- also a Nixon enemies list alumnus -- remarked when his name was found on the new NRA document, ""Put me first on the list."" This defiance is a very American response to such an awkward attempt to intimidate. The NRA enemies list will backfire badly. And then maybe its absurd excess will provoke a needed reset inside the organization, providing a timely reminder that the politics of addition are always more effective than the politics of division.

"(CNN) -- In the horse race coverage of political campaigns, we sometimes forget that elections are just exciting preambles to the main event -- governing. Now's the time when the parties return to Washington and try to implement the people's wishes as expressed in the election. And unlike 2008 and 2010, neither party is likely to misinterpret the results as an ideological mandate. This is a good thing.Â But it's also a mistake to read the election results as simply an endorsement of the status quo.Â Despite the fact that Americans returned President Barack Obama to office while keeping Democrats in control of the Senate and Republicans in charge of the House, this was no seal of approval on the political division we've seen in Washington for four years.Â Instead, it was a decided endorsement for balanced bipartisan plans. Obama won the election with a 16-point margin among moderate voters.Â Republican Senate candidates who represented the ideological extremes of their party -- Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin, specifically -- were soundly rejected even in states that voted for Mitt Romney by double digits. Polarizing voices such as Rep. Allen West were also retired from Congress. The hate and hyper-partisanship that has disfigured our civic debates in recent years was decisively defeated in this election. An Election Night poll by the center-right Main Street Advocacy Fund found that 62% of voters said that Washington needs leaders with ""willingness to compromise to get things done.""Â This specifically extends to the looming ""fiscal cliff"" and ""grand bargain"" negotiations to deal with the deficit and debt.Â Sixty-nine percent of Republicans and 68% of Democrats chose balancing the budget over preventing tax increases as the bigger priority for the next Congress. The broad outlines of a balanced bipartisan plan are well-known -- cut spending, change entitlements and raise revenue.Â That's the ground defined by the Bowles-Simpson commission, the Gang of Six and the Obama-Boehner grand bargain. In all cases, the problem came to selling such a plan to right-wing Republicans, who refused to consider any revenue increases, as well as left-wing Democrats who don't want to see long-term changes to entitlements.Â That's why congressional members of the Bowles-Simpson commission such as Paul Ryan on the right and Jan Schakowsky on the left refused to support its recommendations, even while conservative and liberal senators such as Republican Tom Coburn and Democrat Dick Durbin did. But according to the Main Street survey, 54% of Republicans, 50% of Democrats and 49% of swing voters support the Bowles-Simpson plan -- while just 10% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats oppose it. And despite the strenuous opposition by adherents to Grover Norquist's no-tax pledge, 35% of Republicans say they would be more likely to vote for a member of Congress who broke the anti-tax pledge to find a long-term solution to the deficit and debt mess -- while 31% said it would make them less likely. All this should give members of Congress the courage to reach across the aisle, both in the upcoming lame-duck session and the next.Â House Speaker John Boehner has indicated an openness to raising revenues from comprehensive tax reform that could actually lower rates but close loopholes. Boehner is a deal maker who might feel unshackled from the tea party wing of his party if the president leads in a bipartisan manner. He set exactly the right tone after the election by saying, ""Let's find the common ground that has eluded us."" The opportunity and obligation of Obama's second term will be to depolarize the nation and the Congress. That will require leading on issues such as entitlements as part of a balanced plan to deal with the deficit and the debt. It seems possible that with the right bipartisan style and substance, the president can also achieve comprehensive immigration reform and some aspects of his jobs bill, such as a public-private infrastructure bank. Republicans now realize that they cannot antagonize the Hispanic community and win elections.Â President George W. Bush tried to pass immigration reform co-sponsored by John McCain and Ted Kennedy in the Senate but was defeated by an outcry from the right in 2007.Â Obama could achieve that elusive goal by picking up that legislation again. The good news is that Sens. Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham have said they are resuming their bipartisan talks on the matter. Also, the president's jobs bill, composed almost entirely of policies that had bipartisan support in the past, was dead on arrival in the last Congress for reasons little more profound than election-year hyper-partisanship.Â But with the economy slowly improving and the election over, there is little reason to prolong the painful charade. Ideas such as a public-private infrastructure bank could boost employment while increasing the structural strength of our nation, a clear win-win while the Northeast rebuilds from Superstorm Sandy. Best of all, it can be done with comparatively little cost to taxpayers by simply leveraging government investment with private funds, benefiting private employers rather than creating new bureaucracy. There will be stubborn hyper-partisans who refuse to work in good faith with the other party, pretending that their unwillingness to compromise is political courage.Â They are the problem in our politics, angry conformists who put partisanship ahead of patriotism and problem-solving. We have urgent problems to confront in our country. We have the capacity to solve them, and we know the broad path forward.Â What's been missing is the political courage to stand up to the extremes in our own parties and reach across the aisle. That is specifically what voters want to see in our next Congress -- a spirit of constructive compromise and principled problem-solving that defines the common ground on any given issue and then builds on it. This is the time to redeem the promise Obama passionately articulated on Election Night:Â ""We are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and forever will be, the United States of America.""

"New York (CNN) -- Jack Alvo drives the streets of the New York City six days a week -- the 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift. He never imagined he'd be a cabdriver at his age. After all, a decade ago, he was pulling down $250,000 a year on Wall Street. He survived the 9/11 attacks while working in wealth management for Morgan Stanley on the 73rd floor of the World Trade Center's South Tower. He was a lucky man. But Jack lost his last finance job in 2009, not so long after the markets crashed during the Great Recession. He is still in its grasp, trying to raise two kids, his hair now gray, driving a yellow taxi through the steel and concrete caverns of Manhattan. ""I got caught in-between and things got tough,"" he says simply. ""Never would have thought that I could do this, but being a native New Yorker, I knew the streets. I learned the streets a lot better when I had to start paying attention to them."" There's a rhythm to driving a cab -- ""a bit of science to this game,"" as Alvo says. ""In the morning, you don't want to be caught on the Upper East Side too early. They don't wake up 'til 7:30. But down on Hudson Street, they're younger, more aggressive. They're going to work at Goldman and Bank of America or wherever, and you take 'em."" Then a note of sadness comes to his voice, a slight softening. ""A lot of them don't even remember 9/11, you know. The younger guys, it doesn't mean much to 'em."" It means a lot to Jack. He'd worked his way from Forest Hills, Queens, to Babson College in Massachusetts to a job on Wall Street. On that blue sky Tuesday morning, when the first plane hit the North Tower at 8:46 a.m., Jack remembers one guy in his office who'd lived through the 1993 bombing of the towers running out of his office hollering. ""He moved so fast, he caught the last PATH train to New Jersey. He probably saw the second plane get hit from the Jersey side,"" he says with a half-laugh. ""But to give you a juxtaposition, another guy who was also there in '93 had a gas mask in his desk drawer. He put it on and never left."" In the chaos, Jack started to take the stairs down and then curiosity got the better of him. He stopped around the 56th floor and gathered with others in an office with windows facing the North Tower. ""That's when you see the burning building, the smoke, the debris, the people falling, and people yelling 'my God, my God.' "" He tried to call his wife, who was pregnant and at home that day, but it just went to voicemail. Then the second plane hit. ""My knees buckled. It was like a crashing chandelier,"" he remembers. ""It was above me, like crashing glass, but the impact was so strong it felt like it was underneath my feet. So I just knew I couldn't stay where I was. I got back out to the stairwell, and this time I started to make my way down a little bit faster, 50, 40, 30."" His family thought he was still on the 73rd floor, near the impact zone. ""They were actually taking a tape measure to the TV to try and figure out where the plane hit. They didn't think there was enough time."" There was enough time, then. But the post-9/11 economy eventually led to layoffs and Jack bounced around -- trading commodities and working for a family firm that hedged precious metals. For a while, he was commuting to Palm Beach, Florida, for work, but cutbacks caused him to be an expensive option easily shed. And so began a year of unemployment, taking care of his kids at their rent-stabilized apartment off Columbus Avenue. It was the worst time to be looking for a job, and Jack found himself caught in a no man's land: too senior to be a quick hire, too junior to have a golden parachute. ""Guys like me can be replaced at a much cheaper rate,"" Alvo says. ""You know, a guy who's well into the six figure category, making 250 plus, he's easily replaceable by a guy who they can get for a hundred grand who thinks it's the best job in the world. Or they can replace me with two young guys."" After months sending out resumes with no response, Alvo started driving a cab to make ends meet. More than a year later, he started to put his resume in the back of the taxi for riders to read. He thinks of it as fishing: ""If you've ever been fishing, you know you can spend a whole day on a pond and never catch a fish. But if you know the lay of the land, your odds improve."" Over time, he's gotten some help. A writer helped him tighten the resume, another suggested condensing it to one page and putting them in a basket. ""It does keep my faith in humanity,"" Jack says. ""One thing you learn driving a cab is that it's all connected."" He's gotten some leads -- even a few interviews -- but nothing solid has come through, yet. ""Citigroup just laid off 11,000. UBS laid off 10,000 worldwide, so I'm still in a holding pattern,"" Alvo says. ""I've been in and out of markets for 25 years, and there's always an excuse -- there's an election coming up, or it's the end of the year, wait 'til the budgets get finalized. ... But as time passes, it gets more difficult. People look at you a little differently -- you've been out two and half years now, it's not one year -- that's my only discouragement."" Driving through New York, almost anonymous now in the front seat, Jack sees deepening divides. ""People who have a lot of money, they had their dip, but now they're back. Their bank account has been affected a bit, but their lives haven't. They cut back from four vacations a year to three. But if you've been caught in that downward spiral, coming back is extremely difficult."" It's a riff reminiscent of the fiscal cliff debates we're hearing in Washington, reflecting the growing gap between the super-rich and the middle class. ""We're a tale of two cities now,"" Jack says in a tone that's equal parts resignation and frustration. But that doesn't mean Jack is giving up -- far from it. ""My New Year's resolution is to get out of the cab and back into a 9 to 5. It's just a matter of closing a deal. ... I also want to write a book. I could call it 'From Street to Street' -- from Wall Street to having to work the street, so to speak. I think it would be a story of survival -- understanding that you can have everything at times and sometimes when things get tough, you're forced to take other routes. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. And if you stay focused you can get through anything."" It's not easy, but at 49, Jack remains determined, at turns realistic and optimistic. ""I've been driving a taxi almost half my daughter's life - she's 6. I felt really bad about that idea,"" he says. ""But every now and then, she'll whisper in my ear and say: 'Daddy, I wish for you that you'd get a new job and I'm proud of you.' She actually used those words, 'I'm proud of you.' So I'm stuck driving a cab right now. I never thought it would happen. But I still believe it's all gonna work out -- things do get better.""

"Washington (CNN) -- What a difference. Barack Obama assumed the presidency four years ago on a day full of history and hope. The second time around there is less hype, far lower expectations, and no illusions about the capital's political climate. ""I just want things to work,"" then President-elect Obama told CNN in an interview days before taking office in 2009. To revisit that conversation is to be reminded that on many of the big issues on the original Obama agenda, Washington did anything but work -- or at least work together. Obama's address: Full text . His signature first-term achievement -- health care reform -- was accomplished despite near unanimous Republican opposition. Many other priorities he listed just before taking the oath of office four years ago are still waiting for serious attention - or progress -- as he begins term two. ""The deficit levels I'm inheriting -- over $1 trillion coming out of last year -- that is unsustainable,"" the president-elect said in his final interview before the 2009 inauguration. Yet deficits in each of his first four years topped $1 trillion. More of his first inaugural wish list: ""Let's get a handle on Social Security. Let's get a handle on Medicare."" Four other priorities for Obama's next four years . Deficits, Social Security and Medicare are now carrying over to the second-term agenda. So does immigration. New to the list is a promise to push an assault weapons ban and other gun controls. What do all of these have in common? They are issues ripe for confrontations with Republicans, especially at a time the GOP's conservative base is determined to reassert itself. Yet that wish list also puts the president at odds, to varying degrees, with members of his own party. Liberals, for example, vow to resist any major Medicare changes. Centrist and conservative Democrats, especially those with tough re-election prospects in 2014, are hardly rushing to embrace new gun controls. Inaugural poet: My story is America's . Not to mention a varied and unpredictable portfolio of international challenges -- from a volatile Middle East to evolving economic and security challenges in an Asia increasingly defined by China. And then there is this: the ticking clock of any president's second term. How long will it take before the lame duck debate begins in earnest? Second term priorities . ""They won't have more than a year, 18 months tops,"" said the veteran Republican strategist Mary Matalin, who in addition to her deep campaign experience served as a top adviser to President George W. Bush and his vice president, Dick Cheney. Her own experience in the second Bush-Cheney term shapes her early take on the political climate as Obama begins his fifth year in office: ""With the six-year itch midterm and a 2016 open primary looming, it will be all positioning all the time."" As in the first four years, the strength of the American economy will determine more than anything else how much room the president has to advance his top priorities. A unified voice rises from a divided place: Mr. President, please fix America . Education. Science and technology advances. Critical infrastructure investments. Top Obama adviser David Axelrod lists those as first-term priorities that, in his view, not only carry over to the next four but will shape whether the second Obama term is a success. ""How do we position the American economy for the 21st Century?"" is Axelrod's one sentence take on the president's second-term challenge. A tale of two terms . Obama's preparations included a recent session with presidential historians to discuss not only the climate he faces, but the historical differences for past presidents given the opportunity to serve a second term. President Obama is the fourth of the last five presidents to get a second term. The others - Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush - all had major events that undermined their political standing. For Reagan it was Iran-Contra. Clinton had the gift of a booming economy, but any thought of making progress on major generational challenges, like Medicare and Social Security, were sidetracked by the Monica Lewsinsky scandal and the impeachment saga. Obama in select company . Bush began his second term with opposition to the Iraq war on the rise, and was further damaged by the deeply held view that his administration failed to properly respond to Hurricane Katrina. To Matalin, a fierce Republican critic, a major early second-term challenge for Obama will be to change what she sees as a political reflex that has undermined his ability to work with GOP leaders in Congress. ""Second terms exacerbate both strengths and weaknesses,"" she said. ""If you are humility challenged, self-reverential and self-righteous like Obama, you get even more hubris and demonize rather than debate your opponents."" Biden on Obama at start of second term: 'In simpatico' Obama aides bristle at suggestions he is responsible for the trust deficit with the GOP; they say Republicans made a decision very early on in the first term to oppose virtually every Obama initiative. In their view, the burden is on the GOP in term two to show a more cooperative tone and mindset. Matalin also raised an operational challenge for second-term presidents: high turnover in senior positions, from the White House staff to key Cabinet positions. ""Anyone who hasn't left is exhausted,"" she said. ""Anyone who is new is not top drawer."" Obama's second-term priorities .","At the start of his second term, Barack Obama has major issues left undone from his first .
Deficits, Social Security and Medicare are carrying over into his second-term agenda.
Education. Science and technology advances also are issues that may shape next four years ."
"(CNN) -- One of the mysteries of this administration is that President Obama is a great orator, but not always a great communicator, and we saw that dichotomy in effect again last night in Charlotte. In a season of platitudes, his convention speech was admirably strong on policy specifics but weak on memorable themes. He made a values-driven case for continuing on a difficult path toward rebuilding the great American middle class, but did not offer new details on just how we would achieve those goals in the next four years. He successfully deconstructed the Republican plans as simply being more of the failed same -- ""Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning!"" -- but didn't offer a strategy for how the two parties would work better together in a second term. And where Bill Clinton's speech was focused on centrist swing voters, President Obama's address seemed aimed at the party's base, rocking the convention hall, but losing something in translation over television into living rooms across the nation. The speech contained some clear declarations of difference between the two parties. A close read showed Obama, as always, rhetorically refusing to accept old terms of debate: ""We don't think government can solve all our problems. But we don't think that government is the source of all our problems."" Instead, Obama sees a country balanced between rights and responsibilities, the individual and the community working together to make life a little better for us all. He believes passionately in the ability of government to make a positive difference -- and that is not socialistic, but realistic. Obama soared when talking about foreign policy, driving home the inexplicable failure of Mitt Romney to mention Afghanistan in his Tampa convention keynote. The paragraphs on Osama bin Laden and the rebuilding of ground zero achieved elevation. The president ticked through a list of promises kept, offering data points on our decreased dependence on foreign oil over the past four years, and a goal of 1 million new manufacturing jobs by the end of his second term. He also belatedly embraced the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission as a starting point to reduce the deficit and the debt, something he notably failed to do in his first term. But if this was a sober and serious address, it was also a refined version of his stump speech; there was little new and no overarching narrative arc to make this high-stakes political speech truly stand out from the pack. The White House said this would not be a State of the Union-style address, but there was a telltale laundry-list quality at times. Both Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton -- and even possibly Joe Biden (!) -- offered more seamless inspiration speeches. In contrast, this felt like a speech written by committee. Perhaps best that can be said of the speech, and this is not a small thing, is that President Obama spoke to the American people as adults last nights. He did not promise miracles, but instead steady improvement if we continued to work together, taking the nation in a better direction, one ironically more rooted in mid-20th century values, but better suited to the inclusive reality of American life in the 21st century. It's too soon to tell if any individual lines of this speech will endure. President Obama sometimes seems allergic to sound-bites as a point of pride. Lines like ""Killed bin Laden; Saved G.M"" roll off Biden's tongue, ready for a bumper sticker, but they almost seem too easy for the president and so the pitch is never hit. But the closing lines of the address achieved real momentum and encapsulated President Obama's argument: ""America, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won't promise that now. Yes, our path is harder, but it leads to a better place. Yes our road is longer, but we travel it together. We don't turn back. We leave no one behind. We pull each other up. We draw strength from our victories, and we learn from our mistakes, but we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon, knowing that providence is with us, and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on Earth."" Or, as the new Bruce Springsteen anthem that closed out the convention more concisely said: ""We Take Care of Our Own.""

"(CNN) -- ""Partisanship ought to end at the water's edge"" is a longstanding adage of American politics. But in the hours after the death of the first U.S. ambassador killed in decades, Mitt Romney -- panicked as his poll numbers have slipped -- punched hard against the president, unleashing an unwise, inaccurate and unpresidential attack on the Obama administration. The fog of war applies to the confusion about the timeline of ugly incidents in the Middle East on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But when the U.S. Embassy in Cairo released a statement condemning the obscure and intentionally inflammatory film that had already given rise to riots, the Romney campaign saw an opportunity to amplify its ""Obama-Apologizes-For-America"" narrative.

Despite the fact that U.S. missions in Egypt and Libya came under attack after that embassy statement, with crowds besieging the Cairo embassy and the consulate in Benghazi in the late hours of September 11, the campaign released a statement from Romney saying, ""It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks."" This barely qualifies as dog-whistle politics. At a moment when sovereign U.S. soil was under attack by Islamist radicals, the Romney campaign tried to tie the president to those extremists attacking us, saying that he had ""sympathy"" with their cause. And then, in the clear light of morning, Mitt Romney doubled down on the claim, repeating it -- perhaps for fear of appearing weak -- and his campaign released talking points to hammer home the point. He picked precisely the wrong time, and over the wrong issue, to go ""bold."" Politics: Arab Spring turmoil evokes political response . This is not just politics as usual but something far lower. By point of comparison, when Ronald Reagan was confronted with the downed-helicopter rescue mission ordered by President Jimmy Carter to save the American hostages in the U.S. Embassy in Iran, he did not see it as opportunity to score political points. Instead, Reagan said, ""This is the time for us as a nation and a people to stand united."" Likewise, George H.W. Bush, then also running for president, said ""I unequivocally support the president of the United States -- no ifs, ands or buts -- and it certainly is not a time to try to go one-up politically. He made a difficult, courageous decision."" (Hat-tip to The Atlantic for unearthing these statements.) No wonder a wide array of Republican foreign policy experts rose to condemn Romney's comments, including the longtime speechwriter and senior aide to Sen. John McCain, Mark Salter, who wrote: ""to condemn (Obama) for policies they claim helped precipitate the attacks is as tortured in its reasoning as it is unseemly in its timing."" I called one of the wise men of American foreign policy, Charles Hill, a longtime first deputy to Reagan Secretary of State George Schultz and now a professor at Yale and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, as well as the author of ""Grand Strategies"" and ""Trial of a Thousand Years: World Order and Islamism."" ""In my opinion, Obama is rightly criticized for a foreign policy approach that has not been firm enough. But in this case, the Romney statement was overreaction and not proper,"" Hill said. ""Romney should be standing as an American with Americans right now and not trying to narrowly pursue political profit. I would not have advised him to release that statement."" On the flip side were conservative populist luminaries like Sarah Palin, who took to Facebook, her only dependable perch these days, to write this: ""We already know that President Obama likes to 'speak softly' to our enemies. If he doesn't have a 'big stick' to carry, maybe it's time for him to grow one."" Once again, Palin proved that she doesn't have the temperament or the intellect to be within a thousand feet of the Oval Office. Opinion: Libya killings show U.S. at risk n Arab world . It is also noteworthy that the Romney campaign's instinct is to attack the president on foreign policy but then refuse to articulate its own policy positions as a useful point of contrast. This ""attack and distract"" approach to politics is beneath the office; when you criticize there is an obligation to propose new solutions to the problem. When Romney embarked on his European tour, he frequently cited the tradition of not criticizing a president while traveling overseas as justification for not answering questions about his own foreign policy beliefs. This seemed to many, including me, at the time to be a high-minded excuse to avoid answering specific questions. Now there is no doubt. It was not decency or a desire to get all the facts before condemning the president that restrained his campaign's rhetoric. Many questions still remain. The online ""film"" that apparently provoked the attack seems thrown together and badly over-dubbed to create maximum insult to Islam. It has been promoted by some of the most discredited conspiracy entrepreneurs on our side of the Atlantic, including the ""Reverend"" Terry Jones, who advocated Quran-burning in the past. The American principle of defending free speech cannot be allowed to be compromised by fanatics anywhere for any reason. There is, as the president said Wednesday in the Rose Garden, ""no excuse"" for the actions of this murderous mob in Libya or for the invasion of the embassy in Egypt. Reports are emerging that the Benghazi siege was a premeditated attack by our enemies. Hill describes unsettling parallels: ""With the radical Muslims, there's a kind of connection between the crazy guys in Florida who make this film and the crazy guys in Libya who plan these attacks deliberately and use the films as an excuse, a provocation,"" he says. ""There's a kind of demonic conspiracy between these two types of fringe groups, and it makes life less secure for the rest of us."" Opinion: Extremists don't speak for Libya . Romney is a good man, but his lack of core political beliefs combined with his otherwise admirable competitiveness has led him to make claims about opponents that are often overheated and unrelated to reality. The dishonest drumbeat that Obama travels around the world compulsively apologizing for America is a core Romney campaign tactic. This time, he went definitively too far -- trying to score petty political points with incomplete information at a time when our nation's embassies were being attacked overseas on the anniversary of September 11. It was disgraceful. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Romney, slipping in polls, wrongly slammed Obama over Egypt, Libya attacks .

"(CNN) -- Marvin Miller died Tuesday at the age of 95.ÃÂ  And here's why you should know his name: Miller transformed the game of baseball even though he never put on a uniform. This slight union lawyer was considered the enemy of owners, and yet he might have done more than anyone else to bring free market competition to the national pastime and make it a modern big business. He was lionized and vilified and is sadly still denied entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Baseball combines sports and statistics, so consider these numbers when assessing the career of Marvin Miller. When the Brooklyn-born mustachioed man was named executive director of the Major League Baseball Player's Association in 1966, the average player's salary was just $7,000 a year. Many professional players had to work a second job just to provide for their families. In 1984, when Miller left the position, the average players' salary was $329,000. Today it is $3.4 million. The reason is free agency. And that was the innovation that Miller brought to the game, against the bitter opposition of team owners. Bizarre as it might sound today, 40 years ago baseball was exempt from antitrust legislation. One of the impacts was that players could be contractually obligated to work for one team in perpetuity through what was called the reserve clause. They were effectively denied the ability to test their value in the open market, something Miller saw as akin to slavery. In 1969, he and a courageous St. Cardinals' player named Curt Flood, later christened ""Dred Scott in Spikes"" by columnist George Will, took their challenge to the reserve clause all the way to the Supreme Court, where they lost by a 5 to 3 decision in 1972. But Miller persevered and pursued the players' liberation of their capital through free agency in 1975. This survived a series of court challenges and became the norm today. Yes, players are now paid sometimes absurd salaries, but fans come to see players, not owners, and they deserve their share of the profits as a result. Yes, fans are too often denied their game by selfish strikes perpetrated by players and owners alike. These are unwelcome side effects of Miller's legacy. But the free agency era of increased competition has actually chipped away at monopolies in every sense. Dynasties are less frequent and more teams have climbed from the cellar to the World Series. Competition works. The fact that Miller was denied entry into the Hall of Fame as recently as 2010 speaks to the influence of owners and their deep dislike of Miller's intrusions and innovations. But there is irony that the trust-buster actually helped grow the economic pie of baseball, making more players and owners wealthy. It was ultimately a win-win, though the owners would always have a hard time seeing it. The most eloquent tribute to Miller might have been his extended inclusion in the documentary ""Baseball"" by Ken Burns, one of my favorite movies. But the real tribute is all around us; in countless ways the national pastime has been transformed through the efforts of a man whose name you might not have heard before Tuesday night: Marvin Miller, R.I.P. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Marvin Miller, who died Tuesday, brought free market competition to baseball .

"(CNN) -- The slaughter of civilians in Sudan goes on with too little attention. But when George Clooney gets involved, the world takes notice. And that's at least a step in the right direction. Clooney brought the media spotlight with him Friday, as he protested outside the Sudanese embassy in Washington and was arrested alongside his father, longtime newsman Nick Clooney. On Wednesday morning there were crowds lining the hallways of the Russell Senate Building, a reception more suited to a movie star than a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Inside the packed wood-paneled committee room, Clooney testified about his most recent trip into the remote Nuba Mountain region of Sudan with Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast, where they found themselves in a rocket attack and brought home harrowing footage of children freshly mangled by rockets and bombs pushed out of airplanes. The president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, who has been indicted as a war criminal by the International Criminal Court, and defense minister Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein are repeating a cycle of ethnic cleansing they infamously perpetrated in Darfur a half-decade ago. ""They are proving themselves to be the greatest war criminals of this century by far,"" Clooney testified. Why George Clooney got himself arrested . In a perfect world, the sight of a government slaughtering its own people would provoke enough outrage and attention. But this is not a perfect world, and when atrocities occur outside camera range it is difficult to get the world to care about the slaughter of their fellow human beings. That's why Clooney envisioned the Satellite Sentinel Project, administered by the DigitalGlobe and the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, which uses satellite surveillance technology to pierce the isolation of the Islamist nation. This allows anyone with a computer to be a witness to troop movements, while providing evidence of attacks and burnt villages. ""We are the anti-genocide paparazzi,"" Clooney is fond of saying. The effect is a powerful role reversal -- dictators can no longer hide in the dark. It is difficult to keep people in the Western world engaged in the ongoing slaughters in Syria and the civil war in Somalia, let alone those in the isolated mountain region of Sudan. But state-sponsored murderers bet on our short attention span and lack of follow-through. They know the cameras will eventually go away and then they believe they can go back to killing with impunity. That's why Clooney's sustained focus on Sudan -- and his strategic self-deployment at carefully timed intervals -- has helped keep both light and heat on the Islamist government in Khartoum. When I traveled to what is now the Republic of Southern Sudan with Clooney a year ago for Newsweek to witness a successful independence referendum, Valentino Achak Deng -- the former ""lost boy"" known to Americans as the subject of a ""fictionalized memoir"" by Dave Eggers, ""What Is the What""-- told me that Clooney's involvement in Sudan ""saved millions of lives"" by drawing the world's attention to the region and reducing the chance of another north-south civil war. Clooney is the first to admit that his star power can only help illuminate the problem; it takes policy makers and political leaders to make direct changes that can save lives by stopping a conflict from escalating. What's equally clear is that Clooney can serve as a ""gateway drug"" into these issues, provoking more people to care and inspiring a new generation to help stop suffering half a world away. Clooney is trying to use his celebrity to get us to care about something more important than celebrity, an important wake-up call. But then it is up to each of us to take the next step and focus on humanitarian crises where they occur. We must add our own small wattage to the spotlight of international attention and assure the victims of state-sponsored violence that they will not be ignored, while sending murderous dictators the message that they have no place to hide in the 21st century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: George Clooney, arrested at Friday protest, draws spotlight to Sudan .

"(CNN) -- This election is about the economy -- not social issues or other distractions. At least, that's the mantra we've consistently heard from conservative candidates this election cycle. We heard the same thing during the ""tea party election"" of 2010. But it's an odd insistence from an overwhelmingly social conservative Republican party. Because keep in mind, they're not disavowing anti-choice beliefs on abortion or opposition to gay rights or any other deeply held hot-button issues. They just don't want to discuss them loudly in an election year. It's almost as if bringing up social issues is impolite. But of course, there's an electoral calculation beneath the impulse to keep them in the closet. It is an interesting implicit admission -- that the far-right litmus tests on social issues that seem necessary to win closed partisan primaries also alienate the centrist and independent voters that Republicans need to win general elections. There is no question that fiscal conservatism is what holds the Republican coalition together and helps it connect with independent voters concerned about deficits and the debt. Smaller government and lower taxes are popular promises, particularly if specific cuts aren't spelled out in detail. And certainly, the still struggling economy is a cause of frustration and anxiety. Tell us: Where do you stand on abortion? But all that was true in 2010, when the tea party revived the Republican Party with promises to refocus it along libertarian lines, ignoring divisive social issues because there were more urgent economic matters at stake. Two years later, this pitch has lost some of its punch. That's because we can compare the rhetoric to the record. And contrary to the libertarian promises, social issues have been front and center, especially in the state legislatures that Republicans took control over in 2010. In 2011, 24 states passed a record 92 restrictions on abortion, including mandatory ultrasound legislation, waiting periods, insurance restrictions, and abortion bans after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The pace continued in 2012. Opinion: Can Romney get back on track? Likewise, when Republicans took control of the North Carolina state legislature, one of the first referendums they put on the ballot was a bid to ban same-sex marriages. It passed handily. In Iowa, three judges who ruled same-sex marriage was constitutional found themselves kicked out of office in 2010, and another of those judges is being targeted this election cycle, with former presidential candidate Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal adding their voices to the effort. It's not just a case of unruly conservative state legislatures. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives was elected on a similar promise to focus on the economy. But less than one month after taking office, conservatives pushed through the first of several efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, even though the long-standing Hyde Amendment already prohibits spending federal money on abortions. (The taxpayer money that Planned Parenthood does receive is limited to women's health services, like breast health exams.) With all the promises to cut excess spending, this was an odd place to begin looking for meaningful cuts, unless you recognize that social issues were driving the agenda from the outset. By contrast, look at the contortions many conservatives are going through to avoid making the sequester cuts to the Defense Department -- required after congressional negotiators failed to agree on a deficit-reduction plan last fall -- proposing instead that the cuts guaranteed by the bipartisan failure of the super committee come entirely out of entitlement spending. Navarrette: Dreamers deal a risky roll of dice . It's important to appreciate that social conservatives hold their views dear. And good people can disagree on these most difficult and personal issues, particularly abortion. Vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan is a serious deficit hawk who had the courage to put his budget plans in writing, but he is similarly opposed to abortion even in cases of rape and incest and has written extensively about his beliefs in this area. That this is deeply held should not distract us from the fact that fewer than 20% of Americans support a constitutional ban on all abortions, as called for in the Republican platform. The Clintonian formulation of ""safe, legal and rare"" comes closer to expressing the consensus; but pro-choice Republicans are close to being RINO -- ""Republicans in name only"" -- hunted out of existence. Mitt Romney has characteristically shown less consistent commitment to social issues. He was pro-choice until he started running for president, but now expresses a desire to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He once was a financial supporter of Planned Parenthood, but now wants to defund it entirely. In addition, the man who once pledged to be better on gay rights than Ted Kennedy now backs the Bush-era constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. Rothkopf: Obama on world stage: More hope than change . There's plenty of reason to believe Romney reversed his positions for political expedience while trying to win the Republican primary -- but there's no reason to believe he would abandon those new positions if he became president. Given the conservative congressional record, he'd likely be faced with social legislation if he took the oath of office. Is it reasonable to believe he would veto it in a return to moderation? Many of my libertarian friends are content to ignore these inconsistencies while distancing themselves personally from the social-conservative populists in their chosen party. There are more urgent issues, they say, especially reducing deficits and debt, which have exploded under President Obama. But I can't help but wonder why a serious focus on this front would not have created a tea party rally around the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson Commission recommendations, which would have cut taxes, closed loopholes, reduced spending and enacted entitlement reform. Ryan and his Republican congressional colleagues on the commission voted against it. Likewise, it was the tea party congressmen who undercut House Speaker John Boehner's attempt to forge a grand bargain with Obama during the self-inflicted debt-ceiling crisis. Social issues received earlier and more consistent support on the state legislative and congressional level than serious attempts to reduce the deficit and the debt. Formerly bipartisan jobs bill proposals put forward by Obama -- like a public-private infrastructure bank -- likewise did not move forward, contrary to promises to focus on jobs and improving the economy. The bottom line is it makes no sense to pretend that social issues are not on the ballot this fall, along with more pressing issues. The record of the past two years suggests that social conservatism is a driving force beneath the tea party rhetoric. To ignore that fact is to ignore reality, no matter how uncomfortable it is.

"(CNN) -- It turns out that Richard Nixon was a hippie. Here's Tricky Dick's wisdom on taxation, always worth dusting off this time of year: . ""We shall never make taxation popular, but we can make taxation fair."" See -- he's talking about ""fairness"" -- and we all now know that's code for social justice straight out of Saul Alinsky. And it was especially socialistic for him to invoke the concept back in a time when the top tax rate was 70%. Meanwhile, back in reality circa 2012, we are having a typically overheated election-year debate about taxes -- and both teams in Washington have a point. Republicans this side of Ronald Reagan finally found a way to out-promise Democrats. After decades spent griping that the New Deal's electoral power came from liberal's limitless ability to promise public goodies, conservatives have realized that they can tap into American's anti-tax impulse by promising to lower taxes all the time, regardless of whether our nation is at war or running a long-term deficit. Liberals have always had a hard time appreciating that the American Revolution was founded in part on a tax revolt. But historic perspective is the enemy of partisan ideologues, and on the flip-side, conservatives who idealize the past conveniently ignore that tax rates at the heart of the American Century were almost double what they are today. That was an outrage; by comparison, today's debates are about rounding errors. Essentially, we are debating whether the top tax rate should go back to where it was during the Bill Clinton presidency -- 39.6%, up from the Bush tax cut level of 35%. And this would apply only to households making more than $250,000 a year. I happen to think using that threshold is a mistake. A family making 250k with two earners doesn't deserve to be lumped in with the super-rich at the top tax rate. At the same time, someone such as Mitt Romney, who makes $56,000 a day off passive income from investments, shouldn't be taxed at just 14%. Obama has a real weakness in this year's debate, however. Read through his play-to-the-base budget, and you'll see the term ""fairness"" advanced over and over again. Fairness is a noble goal and contributes to societal stability in the long-run. But the real argument for raising taxes is directly related to balancing budgets and reducing long-term deficits and debt. And that argument is rooted in rhetoric about the ""shared sacrifice"" needed to restore national greatness. After all, the world's largest debtor nation cannot remain the world's sole superpower for long. Obama's fairness rhetoric bypasses that rational argument in favor of something fluffier -- namely, closing the growing gap between rich and poor via the tax code. This might excite the liberal Democratic base, but it also serves to confirm negative stereotypes about wealth redistribution and the left that alienates independents and swing voters. On balance, I think policy arguments about moving the top rate to people making more than a million dollars a year makes good sense. Republicans will balk out of deference to philosophy and big campaign contributors, but even 52% of self-identified tea partiers support that benchmark. It is an additional irony that many conservatives are fine with raising taxes on those 47% of Americans who don't make enough money to pay federal income taxes, as long as top rates are lowered enough to make the overall shift revenue neutral. This isn't tax policy as much as it has become a shell-game masquerading as ideology. Tax day is unpleasant, and it has become a colossal waste of time and money. The current tax code is roughly 10 times longer than the Bible, and Forbes estimates that 6.1 billion hours are wasted in trying to comply with its byzantine structures. Both Obama and congressional Republicans have campaigned on tax reform and tax simplification in the past. The Bowles-Simpson Plan and the sadly abandoned Obama-Boehner Grand Bargain imagined lowering rates and raising revenue by closing loopholes. The real tragedy is that such an agreement should be within reach -- but the 80% agreement keeps getting eclipsed by the 20% disagreement, that signature, stubborn hyperpartisan insistence on all or nothing. So we get nothing. That brings us back to Nixon's aphorism: ""We shall never make taxation popular but we can make taxation fair."" It's about the last piece of useful wisdom on the subject that we've heard out of Washington. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Nixon said taxes never popular but can be fair, when top rate was 70% .

"(CNN) -- The World Trade Center is again the tallest building in New York one year after the killing of Osama bin Laden and more than 10 years after the attacks that brought them down. It is still a work in progress: The hulking steel structure known as the Freedom Tower is still 500 feet shorter than it will be when complete.Â  But it is already a tribute to American resilience, a reminder that whatever devastation we face, we can still come back bigger and better than before. My wife and I live two blocks from ground zero. The transformation of our neighborhood over the past decade has been inspiring, if comparatively unheralded. The streets that were once covered in ash and smoke are now teeming with life. Lower Manhattan is the fastest-growing residential neighborhood in New York, with young families choosing to move into what had been a ghost town after dark for much of the past century.Â Businesses are relocating to Lower Manhattan as well, including many future tenants flocking to the Freedom Tower. Where George Washington took the oath of office, at Federal Hall, is again a vibrant crossroads at all hours. Destruction is easy.Â Any determined idiot can do it. Building is hard work but infinitely more interesting.Â It is an expression of faith in the future. We have been down a long road since the terrorist attacks of 9/11. And too often, the daily work of rebuilding does not get its due. But it is the main event, evidence of how we honor the past while moving on with life. This past weekend, I was in New Orleans, a city that was devastated by Hurricane Katrina just seven years ago. But its heart never stopped beating, and the love it inspires as an American treasure -- ""like one long poem,"" as Bob Dylan once wrote -- is stronger than ever. Bruce Springsteen closed out the first weekend of Jazzfest, and in the afternoon sunlight, he played ""The Rising,"" his post-9/11 anthem of resilience and rebuilding.Â  As he started to sing, a woman near me started crying.Â I don't know the details of whom she lost that day, but it was a reminder of how the shadow of the past is never very far away. By the end of the song, comforted by her friends, she was again smiling through teary eyes and swaying to the music. The Rising is real, and we are living it. It is a tribute to all who we have lost and all that we have been through.Â Most of all, it is the result of hard work. Yes, there have been mistakes and missteps along the way. Some would say with justification that this Freedom Tower milestone has been too long in coming, bogged down in red tape. Â But the path is less important than the destination. It is a towering act of defiance, reaching into the sky as evidence of our refusal to live in fear. The Freedom Tower and the neighborhood springing up around it are testimonials to our continued commitment to an idea embodied by the firefighters who died there on 9/11: We have met the worst of humanity with the best of humanity. Where others have destroyed, we will build. And we will endure.

"(CNN) -- The Vital Center is under siege on Capital Hill. ""Congress is now more polarized than at any time since the late 19th century,"" attests the data-driven blog Vote View. It has gotten so bad that Sen. Olympia Snowe is throwing in the towel on her three-term career in disgust: ""I do find it frustrating,"" she said, ""that an atmosphere of polarization and 'my way or the highway' ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions."" What's worse, she doesn't think it's going to get better any time soon: ""I do not realistically expect the partisanship of recent years in the Senate to change over the short term."" It's just the latest confirmation of what you know in your gut: Our politics have become hijacked by hyper-partisans. Our divided Congress is dysfunctional. Our government is broken. The Maine Republican's comments echoed Indiana Democrat Evan Bayh's statement when he announced he wouldn't seek re-election in 2010: . ""For some time, I have had a growing conviction that Congress is not operating as it should,"" Bayh said. ""There is much too much partisanship and not enough progress. Too much narrow ideology and not enough practical problem solving."" How many times will we need to hear the same refrain before we start taking these warnings seriously? Snowe's announcement follows Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson's decision to not run for re-election after being attacked for compiling a record as the most conservative Democrat left in the Senate. Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman, Al Gore's pick for vice president and John McCain's close ally, has also announced his retirement, for similar reasons. In 2006, Lieberman found himself under attack from the left for his post-9/11 support of the Bush War on Terror and won re-election as an independent after a lifetime as a centrist Democrat. Conservatives have long gloried in the sport of RINO-hunting, trying to defeat what they call ""Republicans In Name Only"" in closed partisan primaries. Longtime centrist Republican Sen. Dick Lugar is the latest to be targeted in this cycle. Now liberal Democrats are trying to get into the game. These professional partisans believe the cure for what ails our political system is further polarization. They are peddling a view of politics as an all or nothing ideological war, the strategy: mutually assured destruction. Certainly, the ranks of centrist Republicans, operating in a grand tradition dating back to at least Theodore Roosevelt, have been diminished. The number of northeast Republicans remaining in Congress can be counted on two hands. Likewise, the ranks of Blue Dog Democrats -- resurgent during the New Democrat centrism of the Clinton years -- have been cut in half. North Carolina's Heath Shuler, who worked across the aisle most recently to try to achieve a grand bargain with a $4 trillion deficit reduction, won't run for re-election. Neither will Oklahoma's lone Democratic congressman, Rep. Dan Boren. ""It is not surprising to hear the news of Sen. Snowe's retirement,"" Boren e-mailed me. ""She, like many of us in the center, have watched with dismay the further polarization of our politics. This is caused by an out of control campaign finance system which includes super PACs, the gerrymandering of congressional districts and a Congress that puts party above the national interest at almost every turn."" Republicans might soon learn to regret the departure of centrists like Olympia Snowe for purely practical reasons: Their attempts to take back control of the U.S. Senate in the 2012 election just got a lot tougher. Snowe was hugely popular in her home state despite some tea party grousing. It is, after all, one of the states where registered independents outnumber Democrats or Republicans. But now her seat is likely to be won by a Democrat, leaving Republicans fighting to pick up another. A half century ago, congressional voting patterns resembled a bell curve -- with some congress members voting on the far left and far right, but most clustered in the center. Not coincidentally, this also reflected the spread of political opinions held by most Americans. There were liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats. The result was that creative cross-aisle coalitions could be formed to pass major legislation. During divided government in the past, we passed the Marshall Plan and the Interstate Highway System. All the Reagan administration legislative accomplishments were passed with divided government -- the same was true of welfare reform and the balanced budgets of the Clinton years. But now divided government means dysfunctional government. There is no trust and little cooperation. As a result, Congress has the lowest approval ratings on record. They cannot reason together and solve problems. The departure of centrists like Snowe will make that job much harder in the foreseeable future. Their frustration with the status quo should be a huge wake-up call to the moderate majority of Americans. The two parties may be polarized, but the American people are not. We need to send that message loud and clear to the professional partisans who are invested in polarization. Make no mistake, the dysfunction will not get better until we change this corrosive culture of conformity in our politics. ""I see a vital need for the political center in order for our democracy to flourish and to find solutions that unite rather than divide us. It is time for change in the way we govern,"" said Snowe in her statement. ""We must return to an era of civility in government driven by a common purpose to fulfill the promise that is unique to America."" I'll devote my next column to some ways we can start to push back on the dysfunctional congressional culture the hyper-partisans have created.

"(CNN) -- Clint Eastwood's rambling speech to an empty chair in Tampa, Florida, was more than just awkward performance art on a political stage. It actually provided a useful metaphor for one of the most nauseating aspects of this presidential election -- the growing gap between narrative and facts. One of my favorite quotes is by the late, great Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan: ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.""Â But because of the rise of partisan media, amplified by the echo chamber of the Internet and talk radio, today everyone comes to civic debates armed with their own facts. And so civic debates get debased, becoming more intense but more incoherent.Â  The Politics of the Empty Chair allows narratives to take the place of facts and usher in an essentially fictitious debate, inspiring monologues that feel like dialogues. It's the political equivalent of shadowboxing, intellectual combat with a fear-fueled misrepresentation of your opponent. The funniest comment about Eastwood's performance came via Twitter from Nation writer Jamelle Bouie: ""This is a perfect representation of the campaign: An old white man arguing with an imaginary Barack Obama."" So Obama becomes a noncitizen and closet communist hell-bent on subverting the American experiment because he has a racial chip on his shoulder. On the flip side, Mitt Romney somehow wants to bring this country back to the 1950s, reimposing not just the Bush years but the white-bread world of prefeminist, segregation-era America. Both visions are nonsense, but both narratives have their adherents on the fringe, which is increasingly blurring with the base of each party. This unfortunately extends to the policy arena as well.Â  So the heated debate over Obamacare is intentionally mischaracterized as a ""government takeover of health care"" despite that there's no public option for health insurance, let alone a single payer. Whatever its many flaws, the individual mandate was a plan initially put forward by the conservative Heritage Foundation, proposed by Republicans as an alternative to ""Hillary Care"" in the 1990s. It was implemented in his state by Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who argued it advanced the virtue of personal responsibility.Â But ""government takeover of health care"" polls better, and so it is repeated in the echo chamber until facts start to fade.Â  This is the Politics of the Empty Chair. In the Politics of the Empty Chair, when a bipartisan group such as the Tax Policy Center criticizes primary opponent Rick Perry's tax plan, Romney holds up their analysis as impartial.Â But when they scrutinize his tax plan and find that it would actually raise taxes on middle class households by removing tax credits and deductions to pay for additional tax cuts for upper-income voters, it is attacked as blatantly partisan, not fit for decent conversation. In the Politics of the Empty Chair, the only facts acknowledged are ones that conform to political self-interest. There are epic ironies when the Politics of the Empty Chair takes center stage.Â The only mention of the ongoing war in Afghanistan on the Republican convention's final night came not from Romney, but Clint Eastwood, who offered a line that implied we never should have gone there in the first place and that Obama should have removed troops immediately rather than offering a timeline.Â This got huge applause in the hall because it was a criticism of Obama.Â The fact that it would have been seen as a seditious attack on Bush-era policy just four years before was ignored.Â  Even wars fade from view in the Politics of the Empty Chair. The most credible criticism of Obama is that the deficit and debt have exploded under his watch.Â But even on this solid ground, the Politics of the Empty Chair creeps in, ignoring the fact that surpluses were turned into deficits under President George W. Bush and that the Romney-Ryan deficit reduction plan, such as it exists, could actually increase the deficit by prioritizing additional tax cuts and making military spending 4% of GDP. The Politics of the Empty Chair allows Paul Ryan to criticize Obama for ignoring the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson Commission, while conveniently ignoring the fact that he himself voted against the Bowles-Simpson commission.Â No one talks back when you're debating an empty chair. The Democrats have their own examples of Empty Chair politics, most notably when entitlement reform is proposed as part of plans to reduce the deficit and the debt. Whenever Republicans propose Medicare reform, liberals reflexively reply with Medi-Scare tactics, trying to scare seniors about reforms that would not effect them.Â This was captured by a particularly ugly 2011 campaign ad showing ""Paul Ryan"" literally pushing grandma off a cliff. Now Ryan, Romney and company are trying to deflect attention from the details of that Medicare plan with Medi-Scare tactics of their own, talking incessantly about how Obama's health care law will cut $716 billion from current seniors. This is an equally cynical attempt to attack and distract -- especially because Ryan's plan keeps such long-term efficiency savings in place -- all part of an effort to confuse seniors and blur contrasts before Election Day. The latest parlor game in the Politics of the Empty Chair is paranoid musing aboutÂ just what Obama will try to accomplish in an ""unaccountable"" second term.Â  This argument implicitly acknowledges that maybe Obama hasn't been as radical as advertised in his first term -- the Republic still stands and the Constitution is not yet confetti -- but just wait until he gets his hands on that second term: then the hammer and sickle will start flying over the White House in earnest. But Obama has enabled the Politics of the Empty Chair to flourish by too often putting oratory above operational action and by his campaign's failure to lay out a clear second-term agenda. To try to stop the Politics of the Empty Chair in Charlotte, criticisms of the Romney-Ryan ticket should be backed up with stats and facts. (This is, I know, too much to hope, but it would be good politics as well as good policy). Perhaps even more importantly, Obama needs to lay out a clear agenda for the second term in his convention speech -- not just poll-tested bromides about defending the middle class, but actual plans, including an alternative path to deficit reduction that takes on some sacred cows on the left, including entitlement reform. Members of the echo chamber love the Politics of the Empty Chair because it allows them to speak for the opposition, creating their own cartoon images, demonizing and distorting them beyond all recognition. The conspiracy entrepreneurs and professional partisans who profit in this environment need to keep their audiences agitated, convinced that they have access to special knowledge. They become addicted to division, divorced from the actual responsibilities of governing and ironically alienated from the Founding Fathers they claim to admire.Â  George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams had their differences, of course, but they all warned against the dangers of falling into factions. ""One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts,"" wrote Washington in his farewell address.Â  ""You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection."" It is worth taking the advice of the original founding father to heart.Â  There is an alternative to the Politics of the Empty Chair -- and that is a serious, civic debate, backed by facts and contemptuous of fear-fueled misrepresentations, especially from our own side of the aisle. After all, America is too great a nation -- and presidential elections too important an occasion -- to have our country looking confused and past its prime, engaged in overheated debates with fictitious figures, while the whole world watches.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is seriously contemplating withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan sometime in 2014, a senior administration official told CNN's Jessica Yellin. The Obama administration had been considering leaving a force of at least several thousand soldiers to act as trainers and to hunt leaders of the Taliban and other militant groups after the long-scheduled withdrawal of all combat troops in December 2014. But Obama has grown increasingly frustrated in his dealings with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who last month cut off negotiations about the size of the post-2014 American military force. Karzai objected to the United States beginning formal direct discussions with the Taliban about peace; he regarded this move as happening behind his back and a betrayal. Let's stipulate that Karzai can be a frustrating leader to deal with and that he can even be quite mercurial on occasions. That said, the Obama administration shouldn't be making important strategic decisions merely on the basis of whether or not its leaders like dealing with another country's leader. Further, Karzai will be gone in April 2014, when the next Afghan presidential election will take place; in only nine months, the Obama administration won't have to deal with him at all. In any case, zeroing out U.S. troop levels in the post-2014 Afghanistan is a bad idea on its face -- and even raising this concept publicly is maladroit strategic messaging to Afghanistan and the region writ large. Why so? Afghans well remember something that most Americans have forgotten. After the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan, something that was accomplished at the cost of more than a million Afghan lives and billions of dollars of U.S. aid, the United States closed its embassy in Afghanistan in 1989 during the George H.W. Bush administration and then zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world under the Clinton administration. It essentially turned its back on Afghans once they had served their purpose of dealing a deathblow to the Soviets. As a result, the United States had virtually no understanding of the subsequent vacuum in Afghanistan into which eventually stepped the Taliban, who rose to power in the mid-1990s. The Taliban granted shelter to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda organization from 1996 onward. After the overthrow of the Taliban, a form of this mistake was made again by the George W. Bush administration, which had an ideological disdain for nation building and was distracted by the Iraq War, so that in the first years after the fall of the Taliban, only a few thousand U.S. soldiers were stationed in Afghanistan. The relatively small number of American boots on the ground in Afghanistan helped to create a vacuum of security in the country, which the Taliban would deftly exploit, so that by 2007, they once again posed a significant military threat in Afghanistan. In 2009, Obama ordered a surge of 30,000 troops into Afghanistan to blunt the Taliban's gathering momentum, which it has certainly accomplished. Read more: Inside the Taliban . But when Obama announced the new troops of the Afghan surge, most media accounts of the speech seized on the fact that the president also said that some of those troops would be coming home in July 2011. This had the unintended effect of signaling to the Taliban that the U.S. was pulling out of Afghanistan reasonably soon and fit into the longstanding narrative that many Afghans have that the United States will abandon them again. Similarly, the current public discussion of zero U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan after 2014 will encourage those hardliner elements of the Taliban who have no interest in a negotiated settlement and believe they can simply wait the Americans out. It also discourages the many millions of Afghans who see a longtime U.S. presence as the best guarantor that the Taliban won't come back in any meaningful way and also an important element in dissuading powerful neighbors such as Pakistan from interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs. Read related: Afghanistan vet finds a new way to serve . Instead of publicly discussing the zero option on troops in Afghanistan after 2014, a much smarter American messaging strategy for the country and the region would be to emphasize that the Strategic Partnership Agreement that the United States has already negotiated with Afghanistan last year guarantees that the United States will have some form of partnership with the Afghans until 2024. In this messaging strategy, the point should be made that the exact size of the American troop presence after 2014 is less important than the fact that U.S. soldiers will stay in the country for many years, with Afghan consent, as a guarantor of Afghanistan's stability. The United States continues to station thousands of troops in South Korea more than five decades after the end of the Korean War. Under this American security umbrella, South Korea has gone from being one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest. It is this kind of model that most Afghans want and the United States needs to provide so Afghanistan doesn't revert to the kind of chaos that beset it in the mid-1990s and from which the Taliban first emerged.

"(CNN) -- Welcome back to work, Congress. Hope you enjoyed your fourth full week off this year. Now find a way to work together to help get America back to work. Experts all say not to expect any constructive action from Congress until after the election. There is a reason that cynicism passes for wisdom in Washington. But with economic clouds from overseas depressing our own recovery, there is an obligation to act now. And, in fact, there is a handful of bipartisan bills that could help get the U.S. economy moving again if they were enacted. These are not Democrat or Republican ideas -- they are simply good ideas. And unlike bipartisan pork barrel bills, they cost taxpayers comparatively little to enact. Let's take a look at three proposals with bipartisan support that could pass this summer if given a chance. Public-Private Infrastructure Bank . The bipartisan BUILD Act is a no-brainer that has been stalled for no good reason. It would create a public-private bank to seed investment in America's aging infrastructure, improving our resilience and competitiveness over the long term while spurring the economy in the near term. ""In a time of budgetary crisis, the American Infrastructure Bank pays for projects with private money now sitting on the sidelines,"" attests Michael Likosky, director of NYU's Center on Law & Public Finance. ""Every country uses private capital to build projects except for the United States. We are an island."" ""We are poised for a new era of prosperity if we could gain consensus on the fact that our infrastructure needs to be rebuilt,"" agrees John Hofmeister, the former CEO of Shell Oil. ""It was designed for a time in the past when our country had a different population."" Voters look beyond monthly jobs numbers . President Obama has backed this bipartisan infrastructure bank bill as more feasible than a version his administration pushed earlier. ""President Obama is the biggest proponent of public-private partnerships to hold office to date,"" argues Likosky. ""The Infrastructure Bank is a rare case of a popular bipartisan idea, born in the Beltway, that has been adopted by governors and mayors."" It is trickle-down policy-making. It's also smart policy-making that business and labor, Republicans and Democrats, should all be able to agree on. The Start-Up 2.0 Act . Forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were started by immigrants to the United States, and more than 40 million jobs were created by new businesses in the past three decades. But bureaucratic restrictions are limiting the number of skilled immigrants who can come to the U.S., and too often we end up educating foreign students and then kicking them out of our country for them to innovate elsewhere. The Start-Up 2.0 bill -- co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Jerry Moran as well as Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Chris Coons -- would allow Ph.D. or master's graduates in science, technology, engineering and math to receive green cards to work in the U.S., while also lifting the per-country cap on skilled worker visas. Obama to call for some Bush tax cut extensions . In addition, it would create new tax incentives for investments in start-up companies and reduce taxes for businesses in the start-up phase. It's precisely the kind of smart incentive that is key to expanding the American dream, while keeping the United States a magnet for the best and the brightest from around the world. Small Business Assistance . The Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act of 2012 -- backed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and pushed by Sen. Chuck Schumer, both Democrats -- is expected to be brought up for a vote this month. It deserves bipartisan support because it builds squarely on a traditionally Republican idea: Use tax incentives to spur job creation, investment and expansion. Specifically, the bill would offer a 10% tax credit for any new hiring or raises this year as well as allow the complete write-off of new capital investments like machinery or equipment consistent with expansion. Analysis: Where are the jobs bills? Much like the forgotten American middle class, small businesses are the backbone of America, and they receive far less government attention than big business, despite the fact that they actually employ more people. There is a competing House bill which would double the tax credit -- and therefore, the cost -- of the bill, but which would also apply to hedge funds and the like. The differences can be bridged, the common ground defined and then built upon. But the focus should be on helping the people on Main Street rather than on Wall Street right now -- objectively, they need the help more. These are all relatively modest measures. (We centrists always try to balance idealism with realism.) Unfortunately, the larger opportunities for broad tax reform or a grand bargain on long-term deficits and debt are unlikely to come until after the election -- and there's no rational reason to expect that the hyperpartisan politics will end then. But that is no reason not to take action on specific targeted bills with bipartisan support right now. The enemies of action include lobbyists who want to keep special treatment for their respective industries embedded in the current tax code, or unions that oppose immigration reform for high-skilled foreign workers. Big ideas with bipartisan support like lowering the corporate tax rate can't get traction for these reasons. Most poisonously, there are extreme partisans in both parties who want to stop progress before the election for fear that the other party might get some credit. Republicans don't want Obama to get visible wins on the economy. And some Democrats are concerned that passing bipartisan bills now will make it harder for the president to run against an obstructionist Republican House of Representatives. ""The American people are held hostage to the selfish political interests of partisans on both sides,"" says Hofmeister, the former Shell chief executive. There is an old joke among congressmen that every bill is a jobs bill, because it is your job on the line. These three bipartisan bills present a win-win on the jobs front -- an opportunity to do well by doing good. Every member of Congress should feel urgency to prove that they can in fact work together on the economy, or face the anti-incumbent wrath of all voters. The political courage that is needed comes from looking out for the national interest instead of being driven by special interests. Governing is not a zero-sum game and just as a rising tide lifts all boats, a growing economy is good for everyone. After all, we Americans are all ultimately in the same boat. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Congress returns to Washington, has an opportunity to help boost economy .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Before dawn on Friday, a man wearing an Afghan uniform shot and killed three U.S. soldiers during a meeting to discuss local security issues in the southern province of Helmand. It was one of an unprecedented series of five attacks by people in Afghan security forces uniforms in the past week against NATO forces. If the trend over the past few months continues, NATO troops in Afghanistan face a rapidly growing threat. It is compounded by the strategy of withdrawing all combat troops by the end of 2014, which will increasingly leave relatively isolated international military advisors embedded with Afghan soldiers. Attacks believed to be connected to Afghan security forces have already killed 34 NATO service members this year, drawing close to the record 36 international soldiers killed in similar attacks in 2011, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation. Nineteen of the 34 NATO troops killed this year were U.S. soldiers, while 15 American service members were killed in such attacks in 2011. These attacks now constitute 8% of the total number of U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan this year. In 2011, this number was closer to 4%. The targeting of U.S. and other NATO soldiers by members of the Afghan security forces first spiked in 2009, and the number of incidents has gone up each year since. In Friday's attack in Helmand, three U.S. Special Forces soldiers were killed. An Afghan official told reporters that a commander at a police checkpoint had invited them to a predawn meal and security discussion, where he opened fire on the Americans before fleeing to take refuge with Taliban militants. ""Now, he is with us,"" a Taliban spokesman claimed, identifying the attacker as a police commander named Asadullah who had been helping U.S. forces train Afghan policemen. If this version of events is correct, the attack was premeditated and carefully planned -- likely with the help of the Taliban, who have claimed a role in about half of such attacks -- known as ""green-on-blue"" incidents -- since the beginning of the war. A NATO military official tells CNN that, in fact, only 11% of such incidents can be definitively attributed to the Taliban. The motivations of about half the attackers are difficult to classify because the perpetrator is either dead or has fled. According to media accounts of such incidents, many of the ""green-on-blue"" attacks appear to have taken place after an argument between Afghan and international troops, or because of an Afghan soldier's personal grievances. A Department of Defense report in April explains ""investigations have determined that a large majority of green-on-blue attacks are not attributable to insurgent infiltration of the ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] but are due to isolated personal grievances against coalition personnel."" In 2011, U.S. military behavioral scientist Dr. Jeffrey Bordin interviewed more than 600 Afghan soldiers and policemen and found they held overwhelmingly negative perceptions of Western soldiers. The Afghan security forces aired grievances ranging from NATO soldiers' supposedly indiscriminate fire that killed civilians to the public searching of Afghan soldiers outside NATO bases, as well as U.S. soldiers urinating in public or cursing at their Afghan counterparts. Another likely cause of the increase in the number of green-on-blue incidents is straightforward: In the past two years the size of the Afghan army and police force has almost doubled from around 200,000 to around 350,000. This may also have contributed to a recent spike in the number of Afghan security forces turning their guns on their own Afghan colleagues. According to the NATO military official who spoke with CNN, there were 39 such ""green-on-green"" incidents last year and already 31 this year. To combat the green-on-blue problem, U.S. and Afghan officials have implemented tighter vetting for Afghan army and police recruits, and now designate one U.S. soldier -- known as a ""guardian angel"" -- in those U.S Army units working with Afghan security forces whose job is solely to guard against attacks while American forces eat, sleep or exercise, the Associated Press reported. A senior NATO military official tells CNN that the coalition has also increased the number of counterintelligence officers in the field to ferret out Taliban double agents. But once all NATO combat troops have left Afghanistan at the end of 2014 any advisors who will remain will rely entirely on Afghan forces for their security, leaving them acutely vulnerable to green-on-blue attacks.","NATO forces a target of shooters in Afghan security force uniforms, authors say .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, Mitt Romney delivered what his campaign billed as a major foreign policy address, in which he sought to distinguish himself from the man he called the ""lead from behind"" president. The speech at the Virginia Military Institute, which largely focused on the Middle East, served as something of a warm-up for the two remaining debates between Romney and Obama to be held later this month, one of which will focus entirely on foreign policy, while the other will deal with both domestic and national security issues. In the forthcoming debates Romney will have the tricky job of trying to position himself as tougher on national security than Obama -- who tripled the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan during his presidency and ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Obama has also authorized six times as many drone attacks as George W. Bush did in Pakistan against suspected members of al Qaeda and the Taliban. The attacks during the Obama administration have killed at least 1,400 people, almost double the number of prisoners that were transferred to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp by the Bush administration. Obama is also the first American president to authorize the assassination of a U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, who played an operational role in al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate and was killed by a US drone strike in Yemen last year. Indeed, Obama has vastly escalated the American covert war in Yemen, using CIA drones and U.S. Special Operations Forces, such as SEAL Team 6. Criticism of Obama's national security policies is growing on the left about the overall legality of CIA drone strikes and, in particular, the al-Awlaki killing. Fact Check: Romney's comparison of past, present Navy pointless . Given those facts, how then do you run to the right of Obama on national security? Well, you might say that you are planning to go to war with Iran because of its advancing nuclear program. Or you might say that you will institute an American no-fly zone over Syria without a United Nations authorization for such a measure. Or that you will keep U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan well past the withdrawal date of 2014 announced by the Obama administration. The problem with such policy choices is that the American public has little appetite for more wars in the Muslim world. No such policies were mentioned in Romney's speech on Monday, nor will they likely feature in his future debates with the president. On Monday Romney did say, regarding Syria, that his administration would ""identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets,"" a policy that is more aggressive than providing ""nonlethal"" help, such as communications equipment, which the Obama administration is already giving to Syrian opposition forces. But even this supposed distinction from Obama was less than meets the eye, as Romney did not directly say that his administration would arm the Syrian rebels. And close American allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are already providing weapons to them. If the U.S. were to start arming the rebels directly, identifying exactly which parts of the Syrian opposition should get arms might be difficult, because the opposition is a tangled mess of many factions that even includes elements of al Qaeda. Fact Check: Was Obama 'silent' on Iran 2009 protests? According to Leila Hilal, a Middle East expert at the New America Foundation, there are more than 800 militias now operating in Syria, making it a complex task to sort out the ones that are both militarily viable and more aligned with American interests. In his Monday speech, Romney advanced the sensible idea that the $1.5 billion in yearly American aid to Egypt should be conditioned on its building up its democratic institutions and maintaining its peace treaty with Israel. But other than this good idea, Romney offered few specific policies to distinguish himself from what the Obama administration is already doing in the greater Middle East. Romney explained that he would prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability and would not hesitate to put more sanctions on Iran. But this is basically the position of the Obama administration, which has said it will not allow Iran to have nuclear weapons and has imposed such onerous sanctions on the country that the Iranian currency has plunged in value as much as 80% against the dollar since the beginning of the year. On Afghanistan, Romney said he will work to transition from U.S. combat troops to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014, which is -- the Obama administration's policy. Romney said he would not make a ""politically timed retreat"" from Afghanistan, a somewhat mystifying construction, since this year Obama negotiated a well-publicized Strategic Partnership Agreement with the Afghan government that will keep an as-yet-unspecified number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan in an advisory and counterterrorism role until 2024. That is something that Romney didn't mention in his Monday speech and hardly suggests a precipitous Obama-led retreat from Afghanistan, which is already America's longest war. Famously, Romney didn't mention that longest war in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in August, so his new embrace of the Afghan War seems a tad belated. Romney's Monday speech underlined the fact that there is more agreement than disagreement between mainstream Democrats and mainstream Republicans on foreign policy issues. Fact Check: Did Obama say he wants 'daylight' between U.S., Israel? To create the illusion that there are genuine substantive policy differences, Romney enlisted the issue of trade, saying on Monday that he would ""champion free trade. ... The president has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years."" There have been serious critiques of Obama for not being more active in negotiating new trade deals, but to claim that he hasn't signed any in the past four years is demonstrably false. In fact, the Obama administration signed trade deals with Panama, Colombia and South Korea last year, which a headline on FoxNews.com termed the ""biggest since NAFTA."" When stories on Fox undercut your claims as a Republican contender for president, you have a problem. Romney was also grasping at straws when he said on Monday that ""the size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916."" That isn't really true even in the trivial, numerical sense -- but more importantly, the U.S. Navy in 1916 did not consist of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines with enough nuclear weapons to wipe out life on much of the planet. The United States today has 11 aircraft carriers, while the Chinese have recently built their first one, which won't actually be able to handle aircraft operations for years into the future. And the overall idea that the U.S. is falling behind militarily is nonsensical. The U.S. spent more on defense in 2011 than the countries with the next 13 highest defense budgets combined. Fact Check: Has Obama 'not signed one new free-trade agreement'? If Monday's speech is a preview of how Romney will handle the foreign policy debates with Obama, the president will be on much firmer ground than he was with his uncertain performance during the first debate, which focused exclusively on domestic issues.","Peter Bergen: Romney sought to draw clear line between his and Obama's foreign policy .

"(CNN) -- George Venizelos, the FBI's assistant director in charge, asserted Thursday in a written statement that the recently arrested ""Sulaiman Abu Ghaith held a key position in al Qaeda, comparable to a consigliere in a mob family."" This is overblown. Though he was Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Abu Ghaith is far from a big fish in al Qaeda. Bin Laden had quite a number of sons-in-law, having sired some two dozen children with five wives. On Friday, Abu Ghaith pleaded not guilty in federal court in downtown Manhattan to charges of conspiracy to kill Americans. But the significance of Abu Ghaith's court appearance was not that he is a big player in al Qaeda. It's that the Obama administration has shipped him to New York for trial rather than sending him to Guantanamo to face a military commission, as has been the case with other members of bin Laden's inner circle. Nothing in his past suggested Abu Ghaith was suited to play any operational role within al Qaeda. Before he joined al Qaeda a few months before 9/11, Abu Ghaith had been a high school teacher in his native Kuwait; he didn't have any experience fighting in other holy wars as most of al Qaeda's leaders had. Abu Ghaith took on the role of spokesman of al Qaeda at the time of the 9/11 attacks, but that didn't mean that he had any operational role in them or even knew they were going to happen. In a private al Qaeda videotape that was discovered by U.S. forces in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, bin Laden is seen gesturing at Abu Ghaith and observing that his spokesman was not clued in on the 9/11 plans. Abu Ghaith appeared in another videotape that al Qaeda publicly released a month after 9/11, sitting next to his father-in-law as bin Laden gloated about the success of the attacks. Around the same time, Abu Ghaith also released a tape that publicly warned ""Muslims in the United States and Britain ... not to travel by plane. We also advise them not to live in high-rise buildings and towers."" A year later, Abu Ghaith fulminated ""Al Qaeda has the right to kill four million Americans, including one million children, displace double that figure, and injure and cripple hundreds and thousands."" But these are the words of a blowhard, not a man of action -- something that is underlined in the indictment against Abu Ghaith that was unsealed on Thursday. It charges him with conspiring to help al Qaeda by making speeches and persuading others to join the group but makes no allegations whatsoever of involvement in any actual terror plots. After the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan in the winter of 2001, Abu Ghaith, along with much more serious players in al Qaeda such as Saif al-Adel, the military commander of the group, fled from Afghanistan to Iran, where they remained under some form of house arrest for around a decade. Abu Ghaith's decision to leave Iran to travel to Turkey led to the chain of events that resulted in him being taken in to custody by U.S. officials in the Middle East and then transferred to New York for trial there rather than incarceration at Guantanamo, Cuba. This is a sound decision for several reasons: . First, the Obama administration's stated goal is to close Guantanamo, not to add prisoners there. Second, the conviction rate since 9/11 in these kinds of terrorism cases is 100% in New York courts when it comes to allegations of any kind of involvement in al Qaeda or its allied organizations. The New America Foundation maintains a database of all the jihadist terrorism cases in the U.S. since 9/11. Of the 39 cases in New York State since 9/11, 20 defendants pleaded guilty and 15 were convicted, while four await trial. By contrast, the military commission system in Guantanamo is largely untested. The operational commander of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was arrested in Pakistan a decade ago but still has yet to face trial in Guantanamo. It's quite possible that the process may take many more years before his trial even begins. Indeed, of the 779 prisoners who have been held at Guantanamo, only six have been convicted according to a recently released study by the Congressional Research Service, which performs research on behalf of members of Congress. In other words, while courts in New York have convicted alleged terrorists at a 100% rate, less than 1% have been successfully tried at Guantanamo. In addition, the few convictions in Guantanamo have in some cases been overturned; for instance, that of Salim Hamden, who was bin Laden's driver. In other cases, the sentences handed down have been very short compared with those in civilian trials of alleged terrorists in the U.S. David Hicks, an Australian detainee at Guantanamo, plea bargained his way out of the camp with time served and nine months in an Australian prison. Perhaps because of his relatively minor role in al Qaeda, the announcement that Abu Ghaith will face trial in Manhattan has not produced so far any of the ""not in my backyard"" response we saw when the Obama administration announced in late 2009 that it was planning to put Sheikh Mohammed on trial in Manhattan. The political storm this unleashed forced the Obama administration to backtrack and to announce two years later that Sheik Mohammed instead would be tried by a military tribunal at Guantanamo. If Abu Ghaith's case goes forward without a backlash in New York and a conviction is secured, as seems all but certain, we can be sure that he will not be the last alleged member of al Qaeda seized overseas who will be sent to the Southern District of New York to face trial -- rather than go before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay and all the uncertainties that such trials have hitherto encountered.","Peter Bergen says role of Osama's son-in-law has been exaggerated .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's not often that a presidential to-do list (and legacy-making agenda) comes down to a couple of key weeks, but here we are: gun control, immigration reform and the budget -- all front and center, right now. It's an odd time in Washington. The president has been dating Republicans, dining with senators with whom he has hardly spoken in the past. Republicans seem to believe they can actually work with the president -- on immigration, at least. As for guns, well, some in the GOP seem ready to filibuster an issue -- background checks -- that has overwhelming public support. ""That won't do us a lot of good,"" moans one GOP pollster. ""We will look like the party taking extremist positions."" Should anyone be able to buy guns? Share your views . Remember how well that worked with women in the last election? And then there's the budget. The president decided to propose one this year that starts with compromise -- containing some of the entitlement reforms that he worked out with House Speaker John Boehner before the ""grand bargain"" became the grand failure. A couple of senior GOP pollsters tell me that they can't quite figure out why the president did something guaranteed to annoy his liberal base. How about this for an answer: When all else fails, it doesn't hurt to look credible. Better yet, it doesn't hurt actually to be credible. After all, what's the downside? ""When you are dealing with dysfunction, the best you can do is demonstrate that you are reasonable,"" one senior administration official tells me. ""The alternative would be throwing fuel on the flames. We need to be serious here."" It's about time. On all fronts. Understand this: This is a not a strategy hatched by a bunch of Pollyannas at the White House. It is borne of necessity, and bred with an understanding of a public that has just about had it with Washington. The president played tough in the sequester fight -- calling for new revenues -- and he lost. Now he's not overplaying his hand; he's playing it smart. On immigration, he's hanging back, letting congressional negotiators take the lead. He was called out for doing that on health care reform -- rightly so, allowing top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to manage an unpopular process and produce an unpopular bill. But this time, it's different: Republicans understand that immigration reform has now become a gateway issue. 'It's now a basic way for us to find our way back into national politics,"" one GOP pollster tells me. ""It doesn't solve our problem with Latino voters by itself, but it helps."" Even polls show that a majority of GOP voters -- once opposed to reform -- are now on board with some version of it. The notion of a ""pathway to citizenship"" still stirs all kinds of fears about amnesty with the GOP base, but that's less of an issue these days: All things considered, any gain in Latino voters outweighs some shrinkage of the base. It's a trickier route for the president on guns. Barack Obama didn't intend for gun control to be part of his second-term legacy; it came to be after Newtown. And this is an issue, by the way, that splits the Democratic Party more than it splits the GOP. A half-dozen Democratic Senate races in pro-gun states next year could hang in the balance. And if the Democrats lose those senators -- and can't break a GOP filibuster -- it's dangerous for them, too. Not as dangerous, of course, as the GOP holding up any vote on a gun bill. That, I would argue, could have a great deal of impact on the midterm elections. Why? Because the president will continue to take the issue directly to the voters, 90% of whom agree with him on background checks. It's a delicate time here in Washington. If nothing happens on guns, for instance, what about the rest of the Obama agenda? ""If you can't pass a bill on guns in this environment, what can you ever do?"" asks one senior administration official. ""It sets the bar so high for anything, people will be demoralized."" The result? Retreat. Maybe some sort of immigration reform passes (it's in everyone's self-interest) but no tax reform. No serious entitlement reform. Nothing big on the agenda, just small-scale items. Perfect for politicians unable to respond to crisis, much less the will of the people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: President Barack Obama's legacy could be shaped in a couple of weeks .

"(CNN) -- Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz has set off a political firestorm in Pakistan with his claims that he was brokering an offer from Pakistan's civilian leaders to the Pentagon to unseat the leadership of the Pakistani military. Those accusations forced the resignation on Tuesday of Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, who Ijaz says orchestrated this proposal, which was delivered in a unsigned memo in May to Adm. Mike Mullen, then-U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state that is home to a number of Taliban groups that attack U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan and also is home to what remains of al Qaeda's ""core"" organization. Haqqani helped smooth over many tense moments in the important U.S.-Pakistan relationship, including the shooting in January of two Pakistanis by CIA contractor Raymond Davis and the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in northern Pakistan in May. Ijaz has said that the offer to get rid of the leadership of the Pakistani Army was sanctioned by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The story is an explosive one in Pakistan, where relations between the civilian government and the military leadership are often tense and the United States is deeply unpopular. Writing in the Financial Times on October 10, Ijaz explained that, ""The embarrassment of bin Laden being found on Pakistani soil had humiliated Mr. Zardari's weak civilian government to such an extent that the president feared a military takeover was imminent. He needed an American fist on his army chief's desk to end any misguided notions of a coup -- and fast."" Haqqani denies being involved in any such scheme, and Mullen says that while he did receive a memo that made this kind of offer-- delivered to him by Obama's former National Security Adviser James L. Jones -- he ignored it because it just didn't seem credible. According to Ijaz, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, Pakistan's powerful military intelligence chief, recently traveled to London to meet with him, where he ""forensically tested"" Ijaz's evidence, which consists of Blackberry messages between Ijaz and Haqqani. While the affair has already brought down Haqqani, a longtime critic of Pakistan's military establishment and a well-known figure in diplomatic and national security circles in Washington, it could also damage the country's civilian government. Haqqani's wife, Farah Ispahani, is President Zardari's spokeswoman and a prominent member of the governing Pakistan People's Party. The man at the center of it all . Who is Mansoor Ijaz, the Pakistani-American businessman at the center of this twisted tale? Born to a family of Pakistani immigrants in Tallahassee, Florida, Ijaz grew up in rural Virginia, the son of two college teachers. After getting an undergraduate degree in nuclear physics from the University of Virginia and an MA in engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the early 1990s Ijaz founded Crescent Investment Management, a New York investment firm. Crescent was politically well-connected. Ijaz's partner in the firm was retired Air Force Lt. General James Alan Abrahamson, who played an instrumental role in President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (""Star Wars""). Another Washington heavyweight, the former CIA director R. James Woolsey, was chairman of the board of Ijaz's publicly listed company, Crescent Technology Ventures PLC, based in London. In the mid-'90s, Ijaz gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party, and hobnobbed with the Clintons at fund raising events. In 2003, journalist Richard Miniter, in a book titled ""Losing Bin Laden: How Bill Clinton's Failures Unleashed Global Terror"", relied on Ijaz as the principal source for the key part of his thesis, which concerned the five years Osama bin Laden spent in Sudan in the early and mid- 1990s. Miniter described multiple attempts Ijaz made between August 1996 and 1998 to interest the Clinton administration in improving relations with Sudan, as well as Sudanese offers to hand over intelligence on al Qaeda. In his account to Miniter and in later writings, Ijaz claimed to have helped draft a proposal for Sudan to provide intelligence on al Qaeda to the Clinton administration, and that Sudan had offered to arrest bin Laden. Clinton administration officials did not take Ijaz up on any of his offers to help because they viewed him as ""a Walter Mitty living out a personal fantasy,"" according to Miniter. And the 9/11 Commission, which interviewed Ijaz, concluded that were was no ""credible evidence"" that the Sudanese had made any offer to hand over bin Laden. In a 2004 interview with Fox News about Iraq, Ijaz, in his then-capacity as a foreign affairs analyst for the network, made another sensational claim: Chemical warheads were being smuggled into Iraq for a potentially catastrophic attack against American troops. And to top it off, Ijaz strongly suggested that the whole plan was given the green light by hardline Iranian mullahs. The story had everything to attract attention -- Mad mullahs! WMD on the loose in Iraq! (At last!) And the threat of thousands of potential American casualties. Ijaz now concedes, ""This was an erroneous report based on information I had received from a former intelligence official on the ground in Iraq. I did not second source this story."" Ijaz also told CNN, ""I have written over 170 op-ed columns, appeared over 200 times on television and have not once had a word of what I said retracted due to factual errors."" (Ijaz has written one op-ed for CNN.com). Ijaz told Fox in 2003 that ""eyewitness sources"" placed Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in Iran. Asked by host Brit Hume about the sourcing of the story, Ijaz responded, ""I can just tell you that the source is unimpeachable. It is from inside Iran. These are eyewitness accounts."" There was, of course, nothing to this story. Ijaz now says, ""At the time I made it, I believed the source who had given the data to me."" Described as a ""U.S. nuclear proliferation and terrorism expert,"" Ijaz told the Gulf News newspaper in 2006 that Iran not only had a nuclear bomb, it was seeking to ""duplicate them in large numbers before revealing their existence to the world."" Five years later, Iran still does not have a nuclear weapon, but Ijaz asserted to CNN, ""They had in my view then, and it remains my view now, at least one nuclear weapon stored in component parts."" In August 2003 Ijaz told the British newspaper The Guardian that he had learned that the Bush administration had brokered a deal with Pakistan's dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, not to capture or kill bin Laden so as not to cause unrest in the Muslim world. Ijaz told The Guardian ""There was a judgment made that it would be more destabilizing in the longer term (if bin Laden were captured or killed). There would still be the ability to get (bin Laden) at a later date when it was more appropriate."" Ijaz provided no evidence for this claim, and the idea that the Bush administration would do a deal to let bin Laden go free is ludicrous on its face. Ijaz told CNN ""I stand by my comments, taken in full context, throughout that article."" Peeling back the layers of the story . Pakistan's government and Pakistani and American journalists continue to look into story behind ""Memogate."" What is puzzling about all of this -- if the allegations are true that Ambassador Haqqani used Ijaz to propose a deal to remove Pakistan's military leaders to Mullen -- is: Why would Haqqani use Ijaz to do this? After all, Haqqani has many formal and informal contacts at the Pentagon, and Ijaz has a history of making sometimes exaggerated or erroneous claims, and his record as an unsuccessful freelance diplomat with Sudan in the 1990s is a matter of public record. Finally, if Haqqani was looking for a discreet back channel to the Pentagon, Ijaz turned out not to be the ideal messenger as he was the person who outed the whole affair in the pages of the Financial Times last month.

"(CNN) -- One of the most perverse results of the IRS's lame, overzealous -- and possibly criminal -- behavior in looking into the tax-exempt applications of assorted advocacy groups is this: They're a lot safer from scrutiny today than they were yesterday. After this IRS mess, who in government is going to be in a rush to take on -- or try to regulate -- the groups they should actually be looking at as political operations, overt or covert? Um, not many. Here's the real deal: It's an open secret in Washington that some of these groups, which spent huge amounts of money during presidential campaigns, are politically aligned. Whatever their ""labels,"" as the IRS might call them, they have been tax-exempt because they claim to be dealing with issues rather than elections. That is, policy, not political candidates. But in the heat of a general election, when policy is politics, how can anyone tell the difference? Priorities USA is a Democratic brand; Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS isn't likely to do anything other than help the GOP. To gain their tax-exempt status, they're supposed to promote the ""social welfare."" What, exactly, does that mean? It's a complicated question that has become infinitely more complex in the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which allowed corporations to start donating directly to activist groups. Suddenly, the potential of getting some dibs on their considerable money grew larger. The groups designated as 501(c)(4) became the perfect pots to hold the dough, and they swelled, literally and figuratively. And the IRS didn't do much about it. It might have been a better idea, rather than embarking on what seems like a potentially criminal political fishing expedition, to actually take a look at the huge amounts of money being spent out in the open during the last campaign. Why wasn't the IRS ""scrutinizing the big fish,"" asks Paul Ryan, the chief lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group that has pushed (unsuccessfully) for the IRS to investigate these groups. ""The IRS needs to be focused on the big fish and not on the little Mom and Pop tea party groups, and certainly not based on their political ideology."" Ah, but that's exactly what happened -- and, as a result, these groups that, according to some estimates, collectively spent over $250 million on candidates during the last election are still tax-exempt. Can it be that the IRS investigators were so silly, clueless and unaware of their appropriate role? Alas, yes. But the legal eagles reading and interpreting the IRS laws are obviously a lot smarter. In its description of the 501(c)(4) category, the IRS lays it out pretty plainly. ""Examples"" of organizations under this statute that would be considered tax-exempt, it says, are ""civic associations and volunteer fire companies."" Hmmm. Not exactly political in any way, shape or form. What's more, the IRS also makes it clear that, in order to qualify, the burden is to prove that ""your organization is organized exclusively (italics mine) to promote social welfare."" But according to Ryan, the gremlins (i.e. the lawyers) have managed to figure out a way to get around this. The new ""perceived line,"" he explains, is that all these groups need to do is spend less than half of their money on politics. He calls it the ""tax lawyer community interpretation."" Huh? Is that how we're running the government? So if these groups spend less than half of their money on politically related activism, the dough they collect from big corporations and donors can be used for campaign activities, all without disclosure of where the money came from. This has not escaped the notice of Congress, especially Democrats who have been outgunned by Republican-leaning groups. ""We urge you to protect legitimate section 501(c)(4) entities by preventing non-conforming organizations that are focused on federal election activities from abusing the tax code,"" seven Democratic U.S. senators wrote then-IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman last year. What makes sense is for the IRS to make sure that its laws are followed. Citizens can at least expect that their government might know the difference between quashing political dissent and legitimate inquiry. Fishing expeditions on political-sounding names is just stupid, if not venal. And now, the obvious -- and perverse -- consequence of the IRS bungling: It has just made the world safer for tax lawyers. Your taxpayer dollars at work.

"(CNN) -- It's the diplomatic equivalent of hosting both the World Cup and the World Series in the same country on the same weekend. On Saturday President Obama welcomes the leaders of the world's most powerful countries to the G8 conference at his country retreat at Camp David in Maryland. And the next day he hosts some two dozen NATO heads of state in Chicago. The challenges of this Diplopaloozaa include some complicated logistics: How do you get eight world leaders and their delegations comfortably situated in the rustic wood chalets that make up Camp David, and which has never hosted this many heads of state before? And the challenges, of course, also involve trying to resolve some very knotty problems: . -- In a time of contracting budgets, what kinds of commitments are plausible for NATO countries to make to Afghanistan after the alliance withdraws all its combat troops from the country in 2014? -- What to do about the civil war in Syria? In a significant and symbolic development, Pakistan's President Asif Zardari has accepted NATO's offer to attend the Chicago summit, according to Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S., Sherry Rehman. Given that the summit's principal focus will be the future of Afghanistan, a discussion without the participation of Pakistan would have been a bit like trying to stage ""Hamlet"" without Hamlet appearing on stage. Right now Pakistan is blocking the transit of critical NATO supplies over Pakistani roads to Afghanistan. Still, the vital air corridor across Pakistani airspace into Afghanistan remains open. Pakistan closed the ground routes in protest after NATO forces killed about two dozen Pakistani soldiers last November at a post on the Afghan-Pakistan border, in what NATO has termed an accident. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar on Monday raised the possibility of reopening those ground supply routes to Afghanistan, saying their closure was ""important to make a point. Pakistan has made a point and now we can move on."" In addition to an agreement on reopening the supply routes, the Obama administration hopes to obtain greater Pakistani involvement in peace talks with the Taliban. A senior administration official says that there is evidence that the ""reconciliation"" process with the Taliban -- which the United States has been quietly moving forward with for many months -- has split the Taliban movement; some elements of the Taliban are interested in reconciliation, while others are ""very upset"" about this idea. The assassination on Sunday of Mullah Arsala Rahmani, a former Taliban minister who was negotiating between the Afghan government and Taliban insurgents -- an attack that has been claimed by a breakaway Taliban faction -- would seem to underline this point. A key issue that will be discussed in Chicago is who will pay for the Afghan army and police after the NATO drawdown. The expected end strength of the Afghan national security forces will be around 350,000 by 2015, although that is expected to fall to 230,000 by 2017. The costs to pay for this are estimated to run around $4 billion a year after 2014, and the Afghan government can pay only a small fraction of it. Although the Obama administration ""won't be passing the hat,"" U.S. officials expect that some NATO countries will announce in Chicago commitments to pay for the Afghan army and police post-2014. At the Camp David meeting one of the most complex problems that will be discussed is what to do about the conflict in Syria. Former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan reached an agreement with Syrian President Bashir Assad in April that Assad would observe a ceasefire and pull back his soldiers from urban areas where Assad's forces have killed thousands. The senior administration official says, ""We have been very skeptical about the Annan plan. We have not seen Assad fulfill any part of the deal."" At Camp David, the administration plans to discuss measures about how to hold Assad accountable for his violations of the ceasefire and the human rights of his people. It will be a long weekend for President Obama and his team. There appear to be no good options in Syria and, like most Americans, NATO countries have grown very weary of the long war in Afghanistan.

"(CNN) -- At a hearing on Tuesday, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009, for the first time publicly explained that he was motivated by a desire to protect the leadership of the Taliban -- in particular, Mullah Mohammed Omar, the overall leader of the movement. Prosecutors say that as Hasan opened fire on a room full of soldiers filling out paperwork for their upcoming deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq, he shouted ""Allahu Akbar! (God is great!)"" Maj. Nidal Hasan can represent himself . The massacre at Fort Hood is part of a trend of ""homegrown"" al Qaeda-inspired terrorist attacks and plots against U.S. military targets. For those individuals who buy in to the late Osama bin Laden's key claim that the U.S. is at war with Islam, American soldiers who are fighting wars in Muslim countries make compelling targets. Indeed, more than a quarter of all the jihadist extremists who have carried out or plotted attacks inside the United States since the 9/11 attacks have targeted the U.S. military. Since 9/11, 21 people have plotted to attack American soldiers or military installations, according to a count by the New America Foundation. Before he went on his rampage at Fort Hood, Hasan had contacted the radical Yemeni-American preacher Anwar al-Awlaki over the Internet to ask whether it would be permissible for a U.S. soldier to kill his comrades in the name of Islam. Al-Awlaki's responses were noncommittal, and although the conversations were a red flag to some law enforcement officials who were monitoring these communications, those officials did not alert the military. A Pentagon report released after Hasan's attack found that the military's official relations with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces were ""inadequate,"" which might have contributed to the failures to communicate about the threat some law enforcement officials suspected Hasan might pose. Here are some other examples of plots or actions that targeted the military: . â¢ A few months before the Fort Hood attack, another jihadist extremist killed a U.S. soldier at a military recruitment center in Little Rock, Arkansas. Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, a convert to Islam whose preconversion name was Carlos Bledsoe, had also attracted attention from federal law enforcement. Despite being questioned by the FBI about a suspicious trip he had recently taken to Yemen, Muhammad was able to obtain a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and ammunition, as well as the ingredients for a Molotov cocktail. â¢ A month after Muhammad attacked the military recruitment center in Arkansas, a Muslim convert named Daniel Patrick Boyd was arrested along with six other men, accused of leading a terrorist cell that plotted to attack the Marine base at Quantico, Virginia, outside Washington. Boyd had a history of run-ins with the law, but his group still managed to amass weapons and conduct paramilitary training before they were discovered. â¢ A similar 2011 plan involved Walli Mujahidh, who plotted with Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif to use grenades and machine guns to attack military recruits at an office complex in south Seattle as revenge for purported atrocities by U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. â¢ Four years earlier, a group of Muslims living in southern New Jersey who were virulently opposed to the Iraq War told a government informant they were plotting to kill soldiers stationed at the nearby Fort Dix army base. In the wake of the attack there, Fort Hood tightened restrictions on who was allowed into the facility, posted more armed guards in strategic locations around the base and implemented the random searching of containers. An extensive independent review to find the ""lessons from Fort Hood"" focused on identifying radicalization within the U.S. armed forces, a phenomenon that poses a particularly grave threat because of soldiers' access to weapons and secure military facilities. The review also identified some of the procedural problems that led to the military's failure to prevent the Fort Hood attack. Following the review, then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates issued a directive ordering the implementation of 47 recommendations to improve ""force protection"" at military bases in the U.S. These included giving military personnel better guidance on identifying suspicious or radical behavior by their comrades, establishing better relations between the Pentagon and the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces and improving communication mechanisms for sharing real-time crisis information across military commands and installations. But while establishing methods to identify extremists is a somewhat feasible goal in a regimented, closely monitored system such as the military, it is not as easy for authorities to do so in the broader community, particularly when the individuals seem to be ""lone wolves"" who are not part of a formal terrorist group. Two attacks last month on soldiers living in the West fit this category. On May 22, two men rammed a car into British soldier Lee Rigby as he was walking down a street in suburban London. They then hacked at him with a meat cleaver and left his body in the road while a bystander filmed one of the attackers. The slaying was justified as ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for tooth ... because Muslims are dying daily."" The following weekend, in what might have been a copy-cat attack, a young Muslim convert who investigators believe ""acted in the name of his religious ideology"" stabbed a 25-year-old French soldier in a Paris suburb. He was likely targeted because in recent years, French soldiers have served in Muslim countries such as Afghanistan and Mali. The suspect, identified only as Alexandre D., first came to law enforcement's attention when he was questioned briefly in 2009. French intelligence services reportedly became aware of the suspect's increasing radicalization in February of this year. Although there have been no successful attacks on U.S. military targets since the Fort Hood and Little Rock shootings in 2009, six of the 15 jihadist extremists who plotted to attack inside the United States in the past two years were targeting American soldiers or military installations. The trial of Hasan serves as a reminder that American soldiers will remain squarely in the crosshairs of those few individuals in the United States who are motivated by al Qaeda's ideology. But in the wake of the Fort Hood massacre, the Pentagon has made a concerted effort to identify and address the government failures that allowed Hasan to carry out his attack, making another ""insider"" attack on a military facility in the United States significantly less likely than it was four years ago.","Major Nidal Malik Hasan says he killed U.S. soldiers to protect Taliban leaders .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan, and Pakistani-American relations, confront their worst crises in recent memory. Pakistan's economy is in free fall, and its major cities are wracked by political violence, while Pakistani attitudes toward the United States have never been worse -- a legacy of the CIA contractor who shot and killed two Pakistanis in the city of Lahore this year, the campaign of drone attacks in Pakistan's tribal regions and the unilateral American raid to kill Osama bin Laden in northern Pakistan in May. On the U.S. side, there is considerable anger about Pakistan's unwillingness or inability to constrain Taliban groups based on its territory that are killing American soldiers in Afghanistan and a perception that while U.S. aid flows in large amounts to Pakistan, it continues to harbor enemies of America. As a result, the rupture in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship may be the most serious ever. Some members of Congress are calling for the freezing of U.S. aid to Pakistan, while the Pakistani government has demanded that U.S. Special Forces troops who have been training elements of its armed forces return home. A further rupture in relations between the two countries would mean placing crippling constraints on American aid, ending dialogue and curtailing cooperation on attacking terrorists. Pakistan is the second most populous nation in the Muslim world and is armed with nuclear weapons. The United States cannot allow such an important country and an ally of the past three decades to become an enemy. In fact, the two nations have many interests in common. The U.S. counterterrorism program in South Asia would be crippled without Pakistan's help. And fostering a stable and prosperous Pakistan would reduce the risks of a nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan, which has been a central goal of American statecraft since the late 1990s. Even many who support the relationship, from Washington Post columnist David Ignatius to members of Congress, have suggested the need for a partial separation, a cooling-off period or a more distant stance. Sens. Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein, while encouraging a renewal of ties, reflected widespread official opinion when they called for steps to re-evaluate the relationship. The general consensus in Washington, in fact, though not endorsing more extreme calls for an outright divorce, appears to hold that the only realistic strategy for rebuilding U.S.-Pakistan relations is gradual, long-term and qualified. Such an argument is hardly unreasonable, given the mutual antagonism and distrust that exists today. Yet we do not agree. Waiting on events, we fear, could invite new crises and a more fundamental break in the relationship. Instead, we propose a new basis for a revised yet lasting U.S.-Pakistan partnership: a collaborative agenda for Pakistan to take its place as a major power in a modernizing South Asia. This concept, which we developed together with a study group of Pakistani economists, journalists and former government officials as well as their American counterparts with considerable experience in Pakistan, calls for actions within Pakistan to build the social, political and economic basis for this vision, as well as a U.S. commitment to support this agenda with critical actions -- on trade, peacemaking and technical support. One important step would be a shift from a relationship in which the U.S. sends aid to Pakistan to one in which the emphasis is on trade that benefits both sides. Textiles constitute 60% of Pakistani exports, half its manufacturing output and a third of its industrial employment. Yet Pakistani textiles make up less than 4% of U.S. textile imports. We recommend a new effort to reduce the disproportionately high American tariffs on Pakistani textiles â as well as parallel programs to enhance U.S. and international foreign direct investment in a range of Pakistani industries â as an alternative to most U.S. civilian aid, which theoretically could amount to as much as $1.5 billion a year if all the aid available to Pakistan was actually disbursed. Efforts to lower taxes on Pakistani textiles have foundered in the past because of opposition in Congress and from U.S. manufacturers, but if this effort was tied to reduced U.S. aid, it might have a better chance of being implemented. On security matters, extremism and terrorism threaten both nations. Yet there is a tendency for both sides to operate in secret, from Pakistani support for militant groups who are killing American soldiers in Afghanistan to U.S. covert operations in Pakistan and drone strikes in the Pakistani tribal regions. This only sets the stage for public outrage when secret activities are revealed without being grounded in the fundamental strategic justification, the shared threat that warrants working together. So the time has come for the two governments to move toward joint, sustainable actions â against terrorism, militancy and insurgency â that can be agreed upon and defended in the public sphere. Pakistani concerns about civilian casualties and infringements of their national sovereignty caused by American drones could be addressed with a more transparent drone program, perhaps involving the public release of some drone video footage, as well as more public explication about why certain individuals have been targeted by drones. all done more clearly under Pakistani government guidance. After all, the war against the militants in the tribal regions is Pakistan's more than America's, and polling in those regions indicates that if the Pakistani military were seen as more directly responsible for the drone program, opposition to it would subside dramatically. Pakistan must also get its own house in order. Economic growth has fallen to less than 3%, and inflation has run in double digits for years, reaching a peak of over 20% in 2008-09, while Pakistan has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world, with less than 2% of the population paying income tax. Pakistan needs to make good on long-delayed tax reform that would boost state revenues and to pursue steps to improve the climate for foreign investment. The motivation for Pakistan to do that is the parlous state of its economy; if it maintains a 3% growth rate, given its high birth rate, the economic conditions of the Pakistani people, which are already bad, will steadily worsen. We also recommend initiatives to accelerate trade throughout South Asia. Improved trade with India represents a natural source of potential growth for Pakistan and a way to ease tensions between the two states. Just as after World War II former enemies France and Germany created the coal and steel common market that spawned the European Union, the more India, Pakistan and other regional players collaborate along economic lines, the more troubling political issues will be seen as nuisances in the way of an emerging regional prosperity. A number of short-term initiatives could jump-start this process: allowing multiple-entry visas for businesspeople, easing restrictions on direct shipping and on rail and air links, and allowing Indian and Pakistani banks to open branches in each other's countries. This will take political will in Pakistan amongst its politicians and the military, which retains a veto over all matters relating to national security. Political will also have to be exercised on the U.S. side to sustain faith in a challenging but essential partnership with Pakistan. The relationship has certainly had its bad patches, but it's one that neither side can live without.

"(CNN) -- In her classic 1962 study, ""Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision,"" Roberta Wohlstetter shows how the Japanese surprise attack on the U.S. naval base on December 7, 1941, should have been less surprising than it appeared at the time because there were warning signs known to the U.S. government that such an attack was possible. Those warning signals, however, were not easy to understand before the Pearl Harbor attack and, in any case, they were not well communicated inside the U.S. military. As Wohlstetter explains, ""It is much easier after the event to sort the relevant signals from the irrelevant signals. After the event, of course, a signal is always crystal clear; we can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has now occurred. But before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings. It comes to the observer embedded in an atmosphere of 'noise', i.e. in all sorts of information that is useless and irrelevant for predicting the disaster."" While the bombings at the Boston Marathon certainly were not anywhere on the scale of the Pearl Harbor attack, they share some of the commonalities that often characterize the run-up to such surprising attacks: Missed warning signals and the bureaucratic ""stove piping"" of important information that if it was more widely shared and understood might have led to the attacks being averted. As is now well known, the Russian security agency FSB told the FBI in 2010 that Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older alleged Boston bomber, was becoming radicalized. The FBI investigated him but found nothing ""derogatory."" Yet, the FBI was unaware that a year after its investigation Tsarnaev returned from a trip to Dagestan and Chechnya in southern Russia--regions that are home to Islamist militantsÃ¢â¬âafter a six month trip, one that could have raised red flags, as by now he was on two federal watch lists. (It's also not clear why the Russians would warn the FBI about Tsarnaev's radical interests and then, apparently, not have done more to keep tabs on him while he was on his lengthy trip to Russia.) A U.S. Customs and Border Protection official on the FBI's Boston joint terrorism task force was made aware of Tsarnaev's return but because the FBI had closed its investigation into Tsarnaev, the information failed to arouse suspicion. According to a report on CNN Tuesday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed concern that ""the homeland security shop had information about the travel to Russia, the FBI did not, and they're not talking to each other and they're going back to the pre-9/11 problems here."" Indeed, these kind of bureaucratic snafus were supposed to have been resolved after 9/11. That's because while the CIA provided plenty of strategic warnings in the spring and summer of 2001 that al Qaeda was planning a spectacular attack, the CIA also spectacularly dropped the ball in the run-up to 9/11 when it failed to ""watch list"" two suspected men that CIA officials suspected were members of al Qaeda, Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar. The failure to add to the watch list two al Qaeda suspects with the Department of State meant that they entered the United States under their true names with ease. On January 15, 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar flew into Los Angeles, but it was only in August 2001 as a result of questions raised by a CIA officer on assignment at the FBI that the two were added to the watch list and their names communicated to the FBI. A month later Hamzi and Mihdhar were two of the ""muscle"" hijackers on the American Airlines jet that plunged into the Pentagon, killing 189 people. There have been many fixes since 9/11 to ameliorate the problem of bureaucratic stove piping: far more communication, for instance, between the CIA and the FBI; the formation of dozens of Joint Terrorism Task Forces across the country that help to facilitate the sharing of information among multiple law enforcement agencies, as well as the creation of the National Counterterrorism Center, which coordinates terrorism policy across the intelligence and law enforcement communities. But even with all of these reforms the counterterrorism system continues to miss the kind of warning signs that take on great significance in the wake of an attack. Consider the case of Maj. Nidal Hasan, a military psychiatrist who killed 13 people at Ft. Hood, Texas, in 2009. Before this attack, intelligence agencies had intercepted multiple e-mails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric then based in Yemen who was well known for his virulent anti-American preaching and ties to militants. Counterterrorism investigators didn't pursue this worrisome connection believing that the e-mails were consistent with Hasan's work as a military psychiatrist. Similarly, Carlos Bledsoe, a convert to Islam who shot up a Little Rock, Arkansas, recruiting office in 2009, fatally shooting a soldier, had recently travelled to Yemen and was under investigation by the FBI following his return to the United States. Despite the fact that the FBI had had him under surveillance, Bledsoe was still able to acquire guns for his attack. When he was arrested, police found a rifle with a laser sight, a revolver, ammunition and material to make Molotov cocktails in his vehicle. Plenty of warning signs also preceded Nigerian Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab's attempt to blow up Northwest flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 with an underwear bomb made with PETN, a plastic explosive that was not detected by airport security. Luckily the bomb failed to detonate, although it set Abdulmutallab's clothes on fire. Abdulmutallab had been recruited by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) for the Detroit mission. The Northwest Airlines plot had been presaged a few months earlier. On August 28, 2009, the Saudi Arabian Prince Mohammed bin Nayef survived a bombing attack launched by AQAP. The would-be assassin concealed the bomb in his underwear, which was made of PETN. Three months before the Christmas Day attempted bombing John Brennan, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, had been personally briefed by Prince Nayef about the assassination attempt, so information about the possible use of a hard-to-detect PETN bomb was known within the U.S. national security establishment. The White House's review of the Christmas Day plot also found that there was sufficient information known to the U.S. government to determine that Abdulmutallab was likely working for al Qaeda and that the group was looking to expand its attacks beyond Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Yet the intelligence community ""did not increase analytic resources working"" on the threat that the group might pose to the West. Additionally, a few weeks before the botched attack on the Northwest flight, Abdulmutallab's father contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria about concerns his son had ""become radicalized"" and might be planning something, but this information wasn't further investigated. As the inevitable congressional inquiries get under way that will focus on who knew what and when about the Boston bombers, we will surely deepen our understanding that there were plenty of warning signs about the increasing radicalization of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, some of which were likely known to the U.S. government. The problem is that, as Roberta Wohlstetter pointed out half a century ago in her study of Pearl Harbor, separating out the really important signals from all the ""noise"" in the system is only easy to do after the fact, particularly when the U.S. government has now assembled a database of an astonishing number of 700,000 individuals it suspects of ties to terrorism.","Peter Bergen: Too often the warning signs of terrorism are missed .
He says before an attack, it's difficult to sort out the signals from the noise .
Agencies often will fail to widely communicate information in time to prevent attacks, he says .
Bergen: Such failures became apparent after 9/11 attacks, Fort Hood shootings ."
"(CNN) -- On Monday, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate a series of recent leaks that critics charge are designed to bolster the national security credentials of the Obama administration. Investigations by special prosecutors can take on a life of their own. Recall that the investigation of the Whitewater real estate deal in Arkansas -- in which Bill and Hillary Clinton actually lost money -- morphed into the scandal of the Monica Lewinsky affair. During the George W. Bush administration, Scooter Libby, a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted not of leaking the name of CIA officer Valerie Plame but of making false statements to the FBI during its investigation of the leak and also perjuring himself. The recent leaks involve stories in The New York Times, Newsweek and the Associated Press that range from the hitherto undisclosed role of the United States in cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear facilities to details about the president's decision-making surrounding the selection of the targets of the CIA drone program in Pakistan and Yemen and the penetration by a spy of al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate. Earlier this month, Attorney General Eric Holder appointed two senior Department of Justice prosecutors to investigate the leaks, and the FBI is also investigating the matter. Have those leaks, as Romney claimed on Monday, ""put American interests and our people in jeopardy""? It is not only Republicans making these charges. Well-regarded Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who heads the powerful Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer: ""I think what we're seeing, Wolf, is an avalanche of leaks, and it is very, very disturbing. It's dismayed our allies. It puts American lives in jeopardy. It puts our nation's security in jeopardy."" The story that sparked these claims was David Sanger's piece in The New York Times earlier this month about the U.S. role in cyberattacks against Iran's key nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz, revelations that also appear in Sanger's fascinating new book, ""Confront and Conceal."" Sanger goes into rich detail about how computer viruses were introduced into the Natanz plant and how they then took over the controls of the finely calibrated centrifuges that the Iranians use to enrich their uranium, causing the centrifuges to spin wildly out of control. But did this really hurt U.S. national security? After all, the Iranians know that their problems with the centrifuges at Natanz are caused by cyberattacks and have publicly said so for the past two years. On November 29, 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told reporters in Tehran, ""They succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts."" Computer experts around the world who examined the Stuxnet virus, the first computer virus that was introduced into the Iranian nuclear program, concluded two years ago that this was a virus that was so complex that it could only have been generated by a state, and the only two states with the technical know-how and motive to write the code for such a virus were Israel and the United States. Last year, German computer security expert Ralph Langner, who had discovered the Stuxnet virus when it had first broken out of the Natanz plant, told a conference in California, ""My opinion is that the Mossad is involved. ... But, the leading source is not Israel. ... There is only one leading source, and that is the United States."" Sanger's reporting about the cyberattacks on Iran revealed that the code name for the series of computer viruses unleashed on Iran's nuclear program is ""Olympic Games"" and also laid out some of the modus operandi of the viruses themselves, but since much of this was generally known by the Iranian regime, it is unlikely U.S. national security was really harmed by the disclosures. In fact, open discussion of the cyberattacks against Iran is in the public interest because three questions about the attacks quickly present themselves: . -- What are the downsides of cyberattacks in a world that is so interconnected by the Internet? -- Since it is the Pentagon's official position that a serious cyberattack against the United States is a form of warfare, is the U.S. therefore already at war with Iran? -- When does a covert action against an American enemy rise to a form of warfare that it merits a broader public discussion? According to Sanger, his sources about Olympic Games included ""current and former American, European and Israeli officials involved in the program, as well as a range of outside experts."" So it is fair to assume that Sanger's reporting was hardly dependent on a particular Obama administration official (or officials) but rather, as all good reporters do, Sanger put together a myriad of sources to arrive at the composite picture of Olympic Games that he paints for his readers. It is therefore quite unlikely that prosecutors will find particular officials behind the leaking but rather that Obama officials gave Sanger some small fragments of the Olympic Games story that he was then also able to piece together with the help of his Israeli and European sources, as well as experts on cybersecurity. Another story that has critics of the Obama administration steamed is that it has allowed to become public that the president personally approves ""kill lists"" for CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, a story reported both by Jo Becker and Scott Shane in The New York Times and by Daniel Klaidman in Newsweek and in his excellent new book about Obama's counterterrorism policies, ""Kill or Capture."" No such criticism attended the Bush administration's decision to turn over to Bob Woodward the highly classified notes from ""50 National Security Council and other meetings"" that became the basis for Woodward's hagiographic book, ""Bush at War,"" about the campaign to overthrow the Taliban during the fall of 2001. There is nothing of substance to the criticism that discussion of the ""kill lists"" endangers national security. After all, drone attacks are an entirely public form of supposedly secret warfare. A drone strike -- when a bomb or missile appears out of nowhere and incinerates some people in Pakistan's tribal areas or in Yemen -- is a public event. And it's a form of warfare that is, of course, well known to al Qaeda. The documents recovered at Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad compound in Pakistan demonstrate how worried al Qaeda's leaders were about the CIA drone strikes. Incidentally, the president's being involved in making these life-or-death decisions about the fates of many hundreds of people in any given year is desirable. Is it a preferable alternative that he shouldn't be involved at all? Also, discussion of the drone program is in the public interest as it's a form of warfare that is unlikely to remain an American monopoly for much longer. After all, the U.S. has only had the ability to arm its own drones for the past decade, and many other countries now possess unarmed drones of their own. It won't be long before the Russians and the Chinese will be arming their own drones and precedents created by the Obama administration will surely be invoked by them. The one story that may be genuinely troubling from a national security perspective is the one written by the deeply sourced Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo at the AP, who made public in May that a plot to destroy a U.S. bound airliner using a souped-up new version of an ""underwear bomb"" developed by al Qaeda's Yemeni branch had had been thwarted by the CIA. As this story could have revealed ""sources and methods"" that might affect the future ability of the CIA or of ""liaison services"" working with the agency to penetrate al Qaeda in Yemen again, the precise source of this leak seems to be the most legitimate avenue of inquiry for the Justice Department and the FBI. Finally, is there any merit to the notion that the Obama administration is spilling secrets to burnish its national security record? To help answer that question, let's quickly recall some of that record: . -- In the first two years of his presidency, Obama quintupled the number of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, as a result more or less destroying al Qaeda there. -- Obama has conducted around 40 drone strikes and airstrikes in Yemen, compared with the Bush administration's single drone strike there. -- One of those Obama drone strikes killed the New Mexico-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, which appears to be the first time an American president has authorized the assassination of a U.S. citizen. -- According to reliable news reports of drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, Obama has authorized strikes that led to the killing of at least 1,900 people, most of whom were militants but around 5% of whom were civilians. (The toll of 1,900 is more than double the total number of detainees who have passed through Guantanamo). -- And, of course, Obama ordered the raid that killed bin Laden, a decision that was made against the advice of two of his most senior advisers, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who had served every president going back to Richard Nixon, and Vice President Joe Biden, who was elected to the Senate when Obama was 11. This does not seem to be the record of a president who needs to bolster his national security credentials, something that seems to be well-understood by the American public. In a variety of recent polls, Obama and Romney are now running neck and neck, but a poll released this month by Fox News shows that Obama beats Romney by 11 points on foreign policy issues and by 13 points on terrorism. The irony of all the ruckus about the recent leaks is that the Obama administration, which came to power promising more government transparency, has been the most aggressive administration in U.S. history in its prosecution of alleged leaks to the press. It has invoked in six cases the rarely used 1917 Espionage Act to go after Americans not working for foreign intelligence services but who have leaked to the media. By and large, the leaks are a Washington pseudoscandal that hasn't really harmed national security but have instead helped to foster a legitimate debate about the future of drone warfare and of cyberattacks that promise to transform warfare as much as fast-moving tanks changed the face of war in the mid-20th century.","Mitt Romney, others have called for special prosecutor on national security leaks .

"Washington (CNN) -- Call me crazy, but I recall when presidential candidates ran for the high office because they had things to say. The notion went like this: I have ideas that I think will be great for the country. I have thought about them, vetted them with experts, spoken about them throughout my career. I have refined them, many times, even changed some. And now I think it's time to run for the presidency, armed with those ideas to present to the nation. So imagine my surprise when, at a recent debate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry turned to Mitt Romney and, with a certain amount of disdain, sniffed, ""Mitt has had six years to be working on a plan. I have been in this for about eight weeks."" In other words, I'll get back to you. So, is it really a bad thing that Romney spent years working on ideas -- changing some, obviously -- to prepare for another presidential run? Or is it actually worse that Perry first had a team of consultants and strategists, and then got to work on the ideas part of the program? Ronald Reagan didn't have to cram a belief system into a new 10-point plan to save the country, because he knew what he believed -- and refined and road-tested his plans -- before he ran. Neither did Bill Clinton, who did have a 'Putting People First' plan, which contained ideas on welfare reform and education that he had spoken about for years. Both men had beliefs -- and of course, ambition -- before they had presidential campaigns. How quaint. This time the process is oddly perverse. A large chunk of the Republican party base is looking for a candidate to fill their own belief system: fiscal and social conservative, tough on immigration, tax-cutter, and on and on. They could go with Romney -- and probably will, in the end -- but they're skeptical about his bona fides. They didn't like him last time around, and they're afraid to like him this time. So they're auditioning. The tea party activists have become the GOP's theatrical directors. Michele Bachmann played well in Philly, but never made it to Broadway. Perry looked right for the part, but blew his lines. And Herman Cain, well, he's very entertaining. They're looking for the sort of artistic perfection which, as we have all learned, is not necessarily a presidential trait. They like Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan, but he's too unreliable on the abortion issue. They may like Perry's new optional flat tax, but cringe at his more liberal views on immigration that allow the children of illegal immigrants to get in-state tuition in Texas. And what about Bachmann claiming, without any proof, that the HPV vaccine can cause mental retardation? Not exactly a presidential move. When Perry entered the race as the fave du jour, it wasn't because of his specific ideas, or his specific record, or his specific abilities: It was because the GOP base had a slot to fill, and they thought he was the guy to fill it. He was conservative, after all. Then he appeared on stage, and somehow appeared smaller than the role demanded. He began the campaign with an energy plan -- predictable from the governor of Texas. But when pressed for more, he finally delivered a flat tax -- an updated version of the Steve Forbes flat tax that never quite caught on enough to get him nominated when he ran in 1996. It's an idea Perry has always said he liked, but now he apparently owns it, having cooked up his own version on the fly. There's a strange whiff here of back-of-the-envelope campaigns. Cain has a tax plan that catapulted him to the lead, then Perry tries out another catchy plan to regain the lead. ""It's a gimmick in response to a gimmick,"" says Vin Weber, a Romney adviser. So could it be that Romney's problem is that he isn't gimmicky enough for these tryouts? He's got a serious, boring, 59-point (how un-gimmicky is that?) plan for the economy that does not include a silver bullet to fix all. He does not believe there is one. Yet if you asked Romney to recite all 59 points, I bet he could do it. I bet he has actually thought a great deal about each one. As he learned the hard way the last time around, presidential politics is a different kind of drama: You can't win the lead by reading other people's lines. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Borger: Traditionally presidents have run for office based on long-held beliefs .

"Washington (CNN) -- For months now, the GOP has been complaining about Barack Obama's class warfare: He's pitting the wealthy against the middle class. He's unfairly asking the rich to pay more taxes. He's dividing the country along economic lines for his own political agenda. But wait. Has anybody looked at what's going on in the GOP lately? Can it be that class warfare is alive and thriving among Republicans? Sure looks that way. How else to explain Rick Santorum calling the president a ""snob"" for emphasizing the importance of a college education? And when Santorum says that John F. Kennedy's speech about the absolute separation between church and state made him want to ""throw up,"" he's not exactly aiming for the academic theologians. In the meantime, Mitt Romney -- that establishment fellow -- is out there on the trail talking about his wife driving ""a couple"" of Cadillacs. Not to mention the fact that he knows the owners, not the drivers, of NASCAR teams. Contrast that to Santorum's venture into the Daytona 500: His campaign is sponsoring a car, not hobnobbing with team owners. Looks like the GOP is driving around some circular tracks of its own, wouldn't you say? In many ways, this detour into class distinctions isn't surprising; it's actually been percolating for years. Remember when Republicans first spoke about the ""Sam's Club"" members of their party -- that is, their working-class, socially conservative demographic? They were onto something. In fact, the less-educated, white voters have been shifting toward the GOP for some time -- and have given the party much of its grass-roots energy. So in scurries Rick Santorum, trying to differentiate himself from Romney and fill the populist void. As it turns out, it's pretty easy: He's the guy from blue-collar Pennsylvania, the grandson of a coal miner. And Romney is a member of the business elite, a platinum card-carrying member of the GOP establishment, son of a scion of the party. Better yet, Romney keeps reminding voters (inadvertently) that he's not like them, each time he tries to connect with the Average Joe. ""It may be important for a voter to be able to relate to a president,"" a senior Santorum adviser told me. ""But it's more important for a president to be able to relate to that voter."" So Santorum is trying to relate to every anti-Romney voter. In Michigan, for instance, evangelicals could account for as much as half of the GOP primary electorate. And Santorum figures he's getting them pretty well locked up with his church-and-state talk. As for those who self-identify as strongly conservative, he figures he's handing them red meat with his chatter about Barack Obama's snobbery -- and Romney's flip-flopping on conservative issues. ""We have a long and storied track record of fighting for conservative causes compared to the other candidate who is running here in Michigan at the top of the polls,"" said Santorum. ""We have a clear difference between someone who has fought in the trenches of the country for conservative causes."" Santorum's attacks on Romney just expose the huge chasm within the GOP between the old elite and the new insurgents. And no matter who becomes the nominee, one faction will be disappointed, and disaffected. The question that remains: whether their dislike of Obama can bring the unity that has so far eluded them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger says now it's the Republicans who are playing class warfare .

"(CNN) -- As the presidential campaign veers off onto the Bain Capital ramp, the predictable arguments ensue: Is the turn simply a political attack meant to distract from bad economic news? (So says Mitt Romney). Or is it an important, valid argument at the heart of the contest? (So says President Barack Obama.) 'Other-ness': What Obama and Romney have in common on religion, race . Distill all the arguments down to an essential core, and they're really about one thing: experience. As in, does past experience matter? Is it an indicator of future behavior? Or of your values? And if you behaved one way at another job in your past, what does that tell us about how you would behave as president? Finally, should your previous experience (or lack of it) in any way disqualify you from the presidency? The arguments over experience are hardly new. In fact, back in the day when then-candidate Obama was a tad short on the experience side, Hillary Clinton made the case that she was the best-equipped to handle foreign policy disasters as president (See: ad with red phone ringing at 3 am.) Obama's response: ""I have shown the judgment to lead."" Which seemed a fair enough retort. So let's apply that standard to the Bain Capital fight: Romney's job was to make money for investors. Bain Capital claims that revenues grew in 80% of the more than 350 companies in which it has invested. It also makes the case that the Obama campaign's cause-and-effect simplification of the eventual failure of a paper company -- such as Ampad -- was completely overblown and unfair: Bain bought the company in 1992, and it grew. Its control ended in 1996, four years before it folded, although Bain did retain some stake in the company. And it folded, Bain says, because the marketplace changed. It's more Dunder Mifflin than Darth Vader. And, um, where was the Romney judgment call in this episode? To be clear: This is a political campaign. Romney's experience at Bain is certainly relevant. After all, Romney often brags about creating 100,000 jobs, so digging into what happened there under his watch is only natural. The problem with campaigns is that issues and events and results need to be either black or white -- especially in 60-second spots that liken companies such as Bain to vultures. None other than the president himself conceded that there's some complexity here, as The Washington Post points out in an editorial, which says the president is trying to argue all sides. ""I think there are a whole lot of folks who do good work in that area and there are times where they identify the capacity for the economy to create new jobs or new industries,"" the president said at the NATO summit. Indeed, this is a president who has friends in private equity, who raises money from private equity and is making a pitch to the same folks this time around. (Full disclosure: A member of my family works in private equity.) The issue, the president told us, is that the goal of ""maximizing profits"" is way different from what a president does, which is making sure that ""everybody in the country has a fair shot."" And Romney, he would argue, has no experience at doing that. Understand this: It's not really just about business. It's about values. The president may be broader in his approach, but his ads argue a more simple point: that Romney doesn't have the right values to be president; that he does bad things to good people. It might be more lucrative for Obama's re-election prospects to go after Romney's actual record -- as a less-than-outstanding job creator as Massachusetts governor. Or as a politician with ""evolving"" views on issues ranging from abortion to immigration. Or to remind independent voters that during the primaries Romney called himself ""severely conservative,"" whatever that means. Some of this is surely in the works. And what about the Obama campaign starting to talk about its own record? Team Obama may want to turn this into a choice election, but when incumbents run for re-election they have to explain why they should be rehired. ""The Obama people believe they can win this election by criticizing Romney,"" says Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration domestic policy adviser. ""But they're going to lose this election if American people don't think they have done a good job."" One more thing: Obama's consistent strength is that more than half of Americans really like him. They see him as in touch with their lives and their aspirations. And his poll numbers only increased last year, for instance, when he shared America's disgust during the distasteful debate over extending the payroll tax cuts. House Republicans seemed in desperate need of day care; Obama was the adult in the room. That's what people want. When a president who wants to be transformational runs a campaign that wants to deliver transparent caricatures, there's a downside. The candidate starts looking like all the other pols. And nobody likes them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: President Obama's argument about Bain Capital is about experience .

"Washington (CNN) -- When you consider the array of public men who have been forced, in one way or another, to come clean on their bad behavior, the list is not insubstantial: a president (Bill Clinton), presidential candidates (John Edwards, Gary Hart), governors (Mark Sanford, Eliot Spitzer), senators (John Ensign, David Vitter). And that's just the top tier. The bar has been set -- and it's awfully low. And by the way, many of these men managed to crawl right under that bar and survive, even thrive. Eventually, they found there was just one way out -- owning up to their own shortcomings. Sure, it may have been due to legal pressure. Or political reality. Or both. But some discovered the public can be forgiving, especially if it believes you have something important to offer to the nation. Just ask Bill Clinton, now serving as philanthropist to the world. So now comes Herman Cain, accused of sexual harassment by four women. He calls the charges baseless and defends his integrity. His political campaign and supporters have gone into full damage-control mode, scrutinizing the women. All predictable -- and reflexive -- enough. But here's the rub: Cain also tells us that the National Restaurant Association investigated the charges against him and found them to be ""baseless."" If he wants to get this behind him, how about getting the facts out? Give the association's board permission to release the results of their internal investigation, if there was a formal inquiry. Then, as they say, the truth will out. And there's another plus: The partisans and the interest groups will have to start dealing with the facts. And the public can decide for itself. It's not as if this predicament is new to us. Recall back in the day when Clinton was in the middle of the Lewinsky mess. Republicans were (rightly) outraged, demanding his resignation or impeachment. Feminist groups, by and large, remained largely on the sidelines or supportive of Clinton -- because he was, um, not a sexual harasser. Oh, and yes, he was good on their issues. Now the tables have turned. Feminist groups are outraged by the charges against Cain and lots of Republican partisans are defending him, choosing to level their scrutiny on the women instead. (We've come a long way, baby, in that some conservative women's groups are criticizing Cain's I-don't-recall defense.) Conservative CNN contributor Bill Bennett sees the hypocrisy of those who raised the red flag about Clinton, but not Cain. ""For we who led the charge against Bill Clinton on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply doesn't matter makes us the hypocrites as well,"" he wrote on CNN.com. He is, of course, right. And it is exactly what we are seeing, much of it from the Cain campaign itself. When declarations of innocence do not seem to be enough, there's the change-the-subject tack: How about fingering a leaker, say from Rick Perry's staff? When that's denied, back off. Then take a turn, and start decrying ""anonymous"" charges. When the charges are on the record, take on the accuser. And when all else fails, blame the media. And the liberal ""Democrat machine."" Ah, it takes me back to the days when Monica Lewinsky was whispered to be a ""stalker"" and Hillary Clinton was taking on the ""right wing conspiracy."" But here's what we learned in that case: The fact that Monica inappropriately bared her underwear to the president did not excuse his behavior. And the fact that Hillary was right about those who were ""out to get"" Clinton does not mean he was in the clear. It's just not that simple. The voters will figure it all out, as always. The bar may be set low for the politicians, but the public somehow manages to rise above it.

"(CNN) -- As the saying goes about political parties and their candidates: Democrats fall in love and Republicans fall in line. And that's exactly what Republicans are doing, or trying to do. But after this combative primary season, watching Mitt Romney's former GOP rivals struggle with ways to endorse their onetime nemesis is painful. It's like they're trying to find ways to snuggle with Darth Vader. At the very least, the contortions are a tad awkward and unseemly. And in the real world (as opposed to the political world), the result is completely unbelievable. It's also a perfect example of why voters don't trust politicians. Consider this: Newt Gingrich finally announced his support of Mitt Romney this week. Yet in his obvious struggle to find the right words to embrace a man he once called a liar, Gingrich came up with this tortured equation: ""I am asked sometimes is Mitt Romney conservative enough? And my answer is simple â compared to Barack Obama? This is not a choice between Mitt Romney and Ronald Reagan. This is a choice between Mitt Romney and the most radical leftist president in American history."" Not exactly effusive, but certainly supportive, at least compared to these Gingrich words about Romney last winter: ""Why should we expect him to level about anything if he is president?"" Or the time he called Romney ""the most anti-immigrant candidate."" Or, at a CNN debate, when he helpfully pointed out that ""I don't know of any president who has had a Swiss bank account."" Well, never mind. Ditto for Michele Bachmann. Granted, she dropped out in January and waited a long time to endorse -- until Romney was the last man standing. And she had him standing right beside her as she finally gave the nod, describing Romney as ""the last chance we have to keep America ... from going over the cliff."" But wait. Is that really what Bachmann believes? As ABC's Jonathan Karl points out, Bachmann told him before the Iowa caucuses that ""He (Romney) cannot beat Obama. It's not going to happen."" The reason: Romney's Massachusetts health care plan, which she called ""the blueprint for Obamacare."" That's exactly what Rick Santorum had been saying throughout the campaign. He's meeting with Romney Friday, but cautions against expectations of an endorsement. It will come, but probably not until Santorum extracts some policy concessions, such as a promise that Romney will never support health care mandates, according to one Santorum source. And it will be hard for Santorum to cozy up to the man whom he said would ""give the issue of health care away in this election. It is too foundational for us to win the election."" Of course, this is not the first time the vanquished have endorsed their previous opponents. (See: Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Also see: John McCain endorsing Mitt Romney circa 2012.) But this primary was so divisive â and so personal â the endorsements seem that much more hollow. There's a very good reason: They are. Conservatives still have a hard time believing Mitt Romney can beat President Obama. They may be wrong, but it's what they really believe even if many of them won't say it anymore. And one more thing: Now that all these Republicans are getting in line to endorse Romney, it only serves as a reminder that they didn't endorse him before he had become the presumptive nominee. I mean, what was Rudy Giuliani waiting for? Come to think of it, maybe distance. After all, America's mayor took to America's airwaves to declare that Gingrich was ""the most electable Republican"" in December. That was when he also told MSNBC, referring to Romney, that ""I've never seen a guy ... change his position on so many things so fast, on a dime."" In the same interview, Giuliani asked a rhetorical question about how President Obama might handle Romney. His prediction: Obama would say ""This is a man without a core ... I think that is a great vulnerability."" As it turns out, there's plenty of that to go around.

"Washington (CNN) -- It's hard to remember a presidential candidate who seemed more, er, unacquainted with the national dialogue -- or presidential prerequisites -- than Herman Cain. At first, he seemed a likable enough fellow. With exactly one idea: a 9-9-9 tax system. Not a truly GOP-minted plan, since it includes a national sales tax, which Republicans loathe. But never mind. He was genial and a welcome addition to those early debates in which some of his fellow contenders seemed so humorless, angry and, in some cases, downright unfriendly. Of course, Cain was unfriendly in that first moment in which he said he wouldn't allow any Muslims to serve at high levels of government (now a Cain classic!). But he backtracked, so the matter seemed to slip away. That's because Cain was still a gadfly -- one of those folks never destined to get the center podiums at the debates. Not serious, and not a serious threat. But as the weeks wore on, Cain became a phenom. Maybe it was the anti-Mitt Romney element. Or the likability factor. Or the anti-politician crowd gone wild. Eventually, he rose to the top of the pack. (Think helium.) But when the gaffes continued -- and the sexual harassment allegations surfaced -- it was no longer harmless. Cain became a parody of the empty-suit candidate, and his campaign proudly carried his baggage. A silly Web ad with the campaign manager taking a drag of a cigarette said it all: grabbing for attention, blowing nothing but smoke. As for the sexual harassment allegations, the man-who-would-be-president alternately couldn't recall them or could mildly recall them. The National Restaurant Association, where Cain worked at the time, recalled one settlement just fine. But Cain never asked for the records to be released to clear his name, so his name remains far from cleared. And don't expect the woman he recently dubbed ""Tutti-frutti"" -- U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann -- to bail him out either. If this is the way Cain wants to behave, I suppose it's a free country. But there is a cost to Republicans. The pursuit of the presidency is a serious undertaking. It requires ideas, beliefs, preparation, discipline, diligence. It is not vaudeville (although it may sometimes look that way). And it's not a book tour or the ticket to a future TV deal (although it may sometimes look that way.) To state the obvious, the president is the person who sends our sons and daughters to war, who manages the economy, who is our face to the world. So when I speak with Republicans who have been around awhile and who have served in top government jobs, Cabinet posts or even in the White House, they're genuinely upset. Not because they support Romney or Rick Perry or Newt Gingrich, but because they believe that Cain just might be sucking all of the oxygen out of the GOP race. And, more to the point, they worry his antics -- and his behavior -- could bleed onto the GOP field, as if the pursuit of beating Barack Obama is somehow trivial. While the other candidates treat him like the silly uncle, he's becoming dangerous to their own brand. Sure, there are always inadequate presidential candidates. But here's where Cain truly distinguishes himself: he defends his inadequacies, even wears them as a badge of honor. So what if he didn't know the president's Libya policy? ""I'm not supposed to know anything about foreign policy period. Just thought I'd throw that out,"" he told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel this week -- the same day as the Libya gaffe. 'I want to talk to commanders on the ground. Because you run for president (people say) you need to have the answer. No, you don't!"" Oh yes you do. Perry spent days trying to recover from a brain freeze in which he couldn't remember the name of a government agency he wanted to eliminate, because he knew he made a real mistake. It was bad, but it wasn't as bad as Cain's Libya moment. ""The only thing Perry couldn't remember was the name of a Cabinet agency,"" Todd Harris, GOP political consultant who is unaffiliated with any of the campaigns, told CNN's Kevin Bohn. ""For Cain, it looked like he couldn't remember what he actually believes."" So far, no other candidates are defending Cain's behavior and lack of serious intent or world view. No one is saying it's a good thing not to know what side we are on in Libya. But they're not hitting him for it either, as they should. And who is going to be the first serious GOP candidate to come out and say more about the harassment charges other than calling them ""troubling?"" I'll give you this: It was far worse with Sarah Palin. After she was chosen as John McCain's running mate, everyone whispered she was inadequate -- but said nothing publicly. In trying to win, the party became complicit in defending an indefensible choice. That can't possibly happen again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: Herman Cain seems to know little about national issues, presidency .

"Washington (CNN) -- What did you do over your summer vacation? If you're President Obama, you've had a bit of a transformation. That is, from the mild-mannered Clark Kent into, well, Superman. Or something like that. When we last left this story, President Obama was trying to be the measured adult in the room, compromising over the debt ceiling to get a deal. In the end, it wasn't the ""grand bargain"" that Obama wanted. Liberals argued that it was awful, too -- chastising the president for negotiating with himself. And Republicans complained that they needed more spending cuts. And, oh, by the way, they still wanted to repeal health care reform. In other words, an unsatisfactory experience for all. So when Obama came back to D.C. this fall, the feeling inside the White House was that something had to change. The bad news: Mr. Adult (aka Mr. Compromise) had sunk to new lows in the ratings. The good news: Congress had sunk even lower. Way lower. Then House Speaker John Boehner gave a speech outlining his demands for the deficit reduction ""supercommittee."" Top of the list: no new taxes. Shocking, I know. That about did it. The White House figured it had no partner for peace. The man who had almost signed on to the grand bargain -- with some tax increases and entitlement cuts -- wasn't about to come back to the table anytime soon. The next step: play the game. The president outlined his demand for the debt reduction supercommittee: no spending cuts for the middle class without commensurate tax increases on the wealthy. No proposals for long-term entitlement reform. But there was a catchy bumper sticker: the Buffett Rule. Billionaires should not pay a lower tax rate than the rest of us. It's not intellectually satisfying. Nor does it improve the chances for a deal out of the supercommittee that can get anywhere in Congress. It's politics, plain and simple. In fact, the strategy does one big thing: It reunites the president with the base of the Democratic Party, which finally had something to cheer. When Barack Obama came out swinging this week, threatening to veto any deficit reduction measure without a balance of new taxes and spending cuts, there was joy among liberals. Obama had finally come home. For the rest of us, well, it was a dismal peek at reality. Who can really fault the White House for playing politics with Republicans who have refused to cut the big deals? After all, the GOP presidential candidates, by and large, are still complaining that Congress agreed to raise the debt ceiling. After Boehner lay down his laws, Obama had to do the same. He could no longer negotiate with himself. So he joined the game. Maybe it's the opening salvo, and maybe something will come of this kabuki. But there is a final calculation here: if nothing comes out of the supercommittee, the president would be less damaged than the Congress. As for the rest of us, we're still Waiting for Superman. The real one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: President Obama is taking tougher stands .

"(CNN) -- It's that time in the presidential cycle again. Mitt Romney, presumptive GOP nominee, appoints a trusted adviser to lead his vice presidential search. The questionnaires are readied; the real level of interest of the contenders is gauged (and all public protestations of noninterest dutifully disregarded.) The candidate's weaknesses are cataloged, both in battleground states and in key demographics. And maybe the candidate weighs in with a guideline or two for the search. This time around, it's clear what one rule will be: The vice presidential nominee needs to be qualified to be president. Just ask Steve Schmidt, John McCain's former campaign manager (now played by Woody Harrelson in HBO's ""Game Change""), about that teensy detail that was, er, overlooked in the Sarah Palin pick. ""The reality of this process going forward is that Mitt Romney will run a very tight, very disciplined, very focused search process which will result in someone indisputably prepared to be president of the United States,"" he tells me. Further elaboration? Um, unnecessary. CNN Poll: Republicans divided on Romney VP choice . It's worth mentioning that the Romney campaign faces some of the deficits that plagued McCain: a gender gulch and a lack of enthusiasm among much of the very conservative base. So it would be easy to pull a Palin, circa 2012 -- that is, look for an appealing, conservative female pol to excite the unexcited. Except that it won't -- and shouldn't -- happen that way. One reason: because Palin happened that way. Another reason: The Romney campaign (and its candidate) are a different breed from Team McCain. ""There's a very different culture,"" says another McCain alum. ""Romney is analytical, data-driven and risk averse. McCain was the opposite of all of those things."" Think fearless fighter pilot in the cockpit versus a man at home in a conference room with spreadsheets. And while the situations are somewhat similar, there are also some key differences in the political environment: It's not as bad for Republicans in 2012 as it was in 2008. The country had Bush fatigue; McCain was seen as offering a Bush third term. There was a massive fundraising deficit, which won't be the case this time around. And the McCain campaign culture itself was chaotic and often dysfunctional -- not so with the Romney folks. The Romney search is being led by Beth Myers, a longtime adviser who some believe channels Romney as well as anyone. She's thorough and understands what the candidate is looking for, and who would make him comfortable. She and Romney also understand the process from the other end since he was vetted by McCain four years ago. Most of all, of course, there is the obvious lesson learned from Palin: that the vice presidential pick needs to have a pre-existing base of expertise on a variety of issues. One of the many mistakes the McCain people have admitted is that they assumed that a sitting governor, by virtue of her position, would be up to the task of answering substantive questions of vital interest to the nation. ""It's the threshold,"" says one former McCain adviser. Well, at least it is now. Sure, Romney will want a running mate who balances his weaknesses with conservatives and maybe can lend a hand in a key state or two. But post-Palin, the vice presidential nominee needs to be one thing more than anything else: competent, prepared and ready to lead. McCain's credibility went down the tubes when the 72-year-old candidate offered the slogan ""America First,"" and then picked Palin as his potential successor. McCain chose the Hail Mary; that's who he is. Romney won't do that. His choice will be more staid and more subdued -- and someone he knows he can work with across that conference table. That might not be exciting, but it would be authentic. Which is exactly what Romney needs to be.

"(CNN) -- It's the biggest, fiercest debate taking place across America. But it's poisoned from the get-go by a Tower of Babel predicament. In disputes over the future of gun laws, people espousing different positions often literally don't understand each other. ""The sides are speaking different languages,"" says Harry Wilson, author of ""Guns, Gun Control, and Elections: The Politics and Policy of Firearms."" Many of the most frequently used words and phrases in this debate mean different things to different people -- or, in some cases, don't have clear meanings to anyone. From terms like ""assault weapons"" to the battle between ""gun control"" and ""gun rights,"" the language in the national conversation is making it tougher to find common ground. ""What language does is frame the issue in one way that includes some things and excludes others,"" says Deborah Tannen, a Georgetown University linguistics professor and author of ""The Argument Culture: Stopping America's War of Words."" The gun language debate: Join the discussion on Facebook . It's a phenomenon that America sees all the time: ""pro-life"" vs. ""pro-choice"" in the abortion debate; ""marriage equality"" vs. ""protecting marriage"" in the battle over same-sex marriage. Those who oppose the estate tax have termed it a ""death tax."" ""The gun control debate is catching up to this now,"" says Wilson, director of the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia. The massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, ""was a game changer. It changed the political landscape overnight."" As the debate rages in Washington and throughout the country, here's a look at some of the flashpoint lingo muddying the waters: . 'Gun control' vs. 'gun rights' When President Obama recently announced plans to sign 23 executive orders on the issue, he avoided the phrase ""gun control."" Instead, he emphasized the need ""to reduce the broader epidemic of gun violence in this country."" ""We've seen this transformation from use of the term 'gun control' to 'gun violence,' "" says Wilson, ""because no one can be in favor of gun violence. That's universal."" ""Gun control,"" to many Americans, is not a positive term, Tannen adds. The key is ""the set of associations people have with a word"" -- and Americans don't like the idea of the government ""controlling"" many of their decisions. That's why ""gun rights"" works well for the National Rifle Association in pushing against new gun laws. ""For Americans, the word 'rights' is always a positive thing. That's not necessarily true in other cultures, but it is for Americans,"" Tannen says. Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, spoke to those associations this week during his testimony before Congress. ""We believe in our freedom,"" he said, speaking for gun owners who are NRA members. ""We're the millions of Americans from all walks of life who take responsibility for our own safety and protection as a God-given, fundamental right."" While the current debate has its own tenor, the focus on language has been around for decades. It's embodied in the title of one of the best-known gun control groups. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence grew out of an organization called the National Council to Control Handguns. 'Common sense' Listen to any leading voice on this issue, and you're likely to hear that term repeatedly. President Obama used it to describe the steps he's calling for, including universal background checks for gun owners and legislation prohibiting ""further manufacture of military-style assault weapons."" The NRA, meanwhile, announced in December that LaPierre would offer ""common sense solutions."" He then pushed for armed guards in American schools. Many Americans were angry and argued that was the opposite of common sense. The NRA later said it believes each school should decide for itself. Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, have begun a political action committee to take on the gun lobby's influence. In an op-ed in USA Today, they said LaPierre's initial remarks showed that ""winning even the most common-sense reforms will require a fight."" Wilson says the term seems to be playing well for those pushing for new gun regulations. ""It makes people say, 'these are common-sense ideas,' "" he says. Language poisoning the debate: Join the discussion on Twitter . 'Assault weapons' But what exactly are those ideas? When it comes to the most controversial one being discussed -- banning ""assault weapons"" -- it's unclear. That's because the term itself is abstract. There is no clear definition of an ""assault weapon."" The 10-year so-called assault weapons ban enacted in 1994 named 19 semiautomatic firearms, as well as semiautomatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns with specific features. ""In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use,"" the Justice Department said at the time. That may be the closest thing to a simple explanation the government ever gave, but if you want to see how incredibly complicated the official definition is in the law itself, check out the language. ""I wrote a book on gun control. I don't know what an assault weapon is,"" Wilson says. The National Shooting Sports Foundation and other gun enthusiasts complain that what ultimately separated an ""assault weapon"" from a ""non-assault weapon"" under the 1994 law was cosmetic. Some Second Amendment groups and gun retailers prefer the terms ""tactical rifle"" or ""modern sporting rifle."" The term ""assault rifle"" was first used by Germany during World War II, The New York Times notes. Later, U.S. manufacturers adopted the words as they began to sell firearms modeled after new military rifles. In today's parlance, adding ""military-style"" doesn't draw a clear line either. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who has submitted legislation for a new ""assault weapons ban,"" says it would include, among other things, ""all semiautomatic rifles that can accept a detachable magazine and have at least one military feature: pistol grip; forward grip; folding, telescoping, or detachable stock; grenade launcher or rocket launcher; barrel shroud; or threaded barrel."" The previous ban included semiautomatic pistols with at least two features, including a detachable magazine, threaded barrel, a shroud allowing the shooter to ""hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned,"" a weight of 50 ounces or more unloaded, or what was described as ""a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm."" 'Semiautomatic' An automatic weapon, as the Justice Department put it, is a machine gun that allows you to fire bullets in succession by holding in the trigger. Fully automatic weapons are severely restricted under existing law, but in some cases they are still legal to own, as the Los Angeles Times notes. They're commonly used in the military but rarely owned by civilians. A semiautomatic weapon can load bullets automatically, but it fires only once each time you pull the trigger. In the effort to prevent mass killings, those pushing for a new assault weapons ban want to halt the production and sale of certain semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity ""feeding devices"" -- such as magazines -- that allow for a large number of rounds of ammunition. Feinstein's bill would ban selling, transferring, importing or manufacturing 120 named firearms, certain semiautomatic rifles, handguns, ""shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic"" and ""semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds."" During the previous ban, gun manufacturers were able to make cosmetic changes to evade the law. One chief question now is how a piece of legislation could avoid the same happening again. CNN iReport: Why own a military-style rifle? Can words help bridge the gap? ""If you get new words, there's a better chance of moving beyond the polarization,"" says Tannen, who is spending this year at Stanford's Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. But, she warns: ""Words don't stay neutral for long -- because they quickly get associated with the people that use them."" When asked for a case in which more neutral language may have helped the government reach a consensus on a controversial topic, Tannen said ""nothing comes to mind."" Instead, the race is on to control the semantics, which are ""crucial,"" says Wilson. ""In American politics, the person who gets to define the issue wins."" A look at U.S. gun laws .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's an audition without end, because the Republicans still can't figure out how to cast the lead role. Here's how the internal discussion goes: We need someone who is a true conservative. We need someone who is right on the matters we care about -- the deficit, immigration, cultural issues. We need someone we can trust, who won't betray us. And, by the way, we also need someone who can win. And so Republicans, undecided and unwilling to settle, continue to move like hummingbirds, from, um, flower to flower. Yesterday, it was Herman Cain. Today, it's Newt Gingrich. Maybe one day, Mitt Romney. Sure, this is all about the deep and abiding reluctance within the GOP to ""settle"" for Romney. After the last two years of conservative ascendancy, why go with a candidate who seems more pragmatist than true believer? Why risk nominating another version of George H. W. Bush, who turned on conservatives and raised taxes? No way, they say. All of which has inspired an obvious GOP conflict between the head and the heart: In their brains, Republicans know they ought to be looking for the most conservative Republican who has a good chance of getting elected. In their hearts, they are driven by anger at President Obama, and they're looking for someone who can make the GOP case -- without compromise. Simply put, the heartfelt question is the 2012 version of ""Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the most conservative of them all?"" It's the answer that's complicated. First, it doesn't help that the non-Mitt GOP field is incredibly weak. Start with Michele Bachmann, who self-destructed when she claimed an HPV vaccine could cause mental retardation. Then to Rick Perry, who couldn't remember his own plan to cut government. Then to Cain who, well, has personal issues. Then to Gingrich, who now seems to be the pick of the non-Mitt litter, dazzling audiences with his professorial instant recall of the Battle of Gettysburg and his obvious willingness to launch a frontal assault on Obama. Ah, but it's Newt Gingrich. And any historian knows that Newt has a long personal history of self-destruction. He became famous as the architect of the GOP revolution in 1994 that made him House speaker; then infamous as a lead critic of Bill Clinton's presidential affair while Gingrich was privately involved in one of his own. He's the man calling for civil, Lincoln-Douglas style debates; he's also the man who has called Obama ""the most successful food stamp president"" in American history. How polite. And then there's the fact that Gingrich, a leader of one GOP revolution almost two decades ago, hasn't had much to do with the current one. He famously went on TV and called Rep. Paul Ryan's budget -- the Holy Grail for most House Republicans -- ""right-wing social engineering."" If he seems oddly out of touch with the GOP rank and file, that's probably because he is. And even if the candidates weren't so problematic, the GOP itself is having some identity issues. The tea partiers, who were so important and popular in the 2010 midterm elections, are fast losing their luster. Recent polls show the tea party lost support nationwide -- as well as in the strong tea party districts. According to a new Pew Center poll, in the 60 districts now held by tea party members, the GOP is viewed just as negatively as the Democrats. So Republicans, who have spent so much time pandering to the tea party on issues, may now have to readjust. The tea party may have energized a lot of Republicans, but it may also have traumatized others -- especially those looking for a winner in 2012. Which brings us back to Mitt Romney. He's getting a tad testy these days about the long audition, telling Bret Baier on Fox that he's not a ""lifelong politician"" like Gingrich. And he's not for ""amnesty"" like Newt. And that, of course, he has the ""best shot"" of replacing Obama if he is the GOP nominee. He's got his lines down pat. Now Republicans need to figure out what kind of character they want to play the lead.

"Washington (CNN) -- It's a problem that has been around for awhile, and the longer it stays, the tougher it is to reverse. That's because it's a riddle that's almost impossible to resolve: Americans want the government to fix our problems, but they don't trust the government to do it. We want health care to be fixed, Medicare and Social Security to stay intact, emergencies to be handled. We also want lower taxes along with a smallerâyet more responsiveâgovernment. All in all, we would like to spend less and get more. Small wonder we don't believe government can do it, because it cannot. According to the latest CNN/ORC poll, the public's trust in the federal government has dropped to an all-time low: Only 15% of Americans today say they trust the government to do what's right just about always or most of the timeâdown 10 points from about a year ago. The last time that number was perilously close to rock bottom was in 1994, after Bill Clinton lost health care reform. And it prompted the president to famously declare ""the era of big government is over."" Only it isn't. And that's the essential conundrum for Barack Obama. He's been a big-agenda president. He sees himself as transformational, so anything less would not do. But the more he didâeconomic stimulus, health care reformâ the more the public recoiled. They didn't see the results, and hated the partisanship. All of which makes sense. Even the president himself, back in 2009, admitted he hadn't laid the groundwork for his big agenda. After all, how can you convince the public to expand the government while most people believe it's bloated and out of control? ""I understand that people are feeling uncertain about this. They feel anxious, partly because we've just become so cynical about what government can accomplish that people's attitudes are, you know, even though I don't like this devil, at least I know it, and I like that more than the devil I don't know,"" the president said at a press conference in the middle of the health care debate. ""So folks are skeptical. And that is entirely legitimate, because they haven't seen a lot of laws coming out of Washington lately that helped them."" All of which is true. But here's where leadership comes inâand has been lacking. The public distrusts government because its leaders haven't been able to work together to produce much of anything. Sure, we want it allâand that's our fault. But if we had some honest politicians out there, on both sides of the aisle, saying we can't have it all, we just might listen to them. Instead, we hear each side yammering about how the other guys solutions will kill the country or jobs or your bank account, so we figure we can't trust any of them. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. In fact, I would make the argument thatâafter watching the debt ceiling debacleâit would be strange to feel anything other than disrespect for Washington. And the more Congress fools with people's livesâlike playing games over emergency fundingâthe more the public turns off. And it's not going to get any better the closer we get to an election. It is true that distrust of government is nothing new. It's also not news that we want the government to solve our problems even though we think it's full of scoundrels. ""There is nothing new about this ambivalence,"" scholars, and former Clinton administration officials, Bill Galston and Elaine Kamarck point out in an essay called ""Change you can believe in requires a government you can trust."" They also make this important point: It's up to the president to lead. 'How ... the president deals with it may make the difference between success and failure."" The problem for Obama now is that he has dealt with the problems in all ways: As the partisan and as the conciliator. Yes, the often-recalcitrant freshmen Republicans have backed him into a corner, because they refuse to deal on much of anything. Even so, the president's initial identityâas a change-agent who can fix Washingtonâis gone. Ronald Reagan understood the public's skepticism about government. He often joked that the scariest sentence in America is ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help."" This president's problem is that he wants the government to helpâonly he hasn't been able to convince the public that government has changed. That's because it hasn't.

"(CNN) -- My dad was an avid sports fan and a great athlete in his day. We used to watch basketball and football games together, and I know some of his proudest moments as a father were when I wore my sports uniforms in high school and college. He was a man's man â a hard drinking, foul-mouthed veteran of the Korean War who came on to every voluptuous nurse who crossed his path. He passed away about this time last year. I think about him often, and more during March Madness. I thought about him yesterday as I read about Jason Collins coming out as the first openly gay player in NBA history. I wondered, ""If my dad were reading this, what would he say?"" And, clear as day, I heard his voice. ""Yeah, but can the dude play?"" It made me laugh because isn't it just that simple? Can he play? Can he do his job? At the same time that Jason Collins' announcement has caused a stir, there also has been noteworthy non-reaction among many. ""Is this really still news?"" we ask. The answer is yes. It is news because it's never happened before. Pro sports, especially the ones where athletes get paid millions upon millions of dollars, are bastion of masculinity. Manhood, athleticism and heterosexuality are all woven together in our cultural paradigm. It's still news because the stereotype of gay men as being effete, weak, uncoordinated (except where it comes to Lady Gaga impersonations) and otherwise ""girly"" is still so strong. In NBA, Collins' defense matters more than sexual orientation . It shouldn't be. Gay comes in all shapes, sizes, strengths and personalities. Just like straight does. It shouldn't be news thatâ guess what â some gay people don't fit your stereotype. But it is. It shouldn't be news for that reason, but I'm grateful that it is news for an entirely different reason. Jason's coming out is a very, very public ""it gets better"" message to all the LGBTQ youth coming up, and out, right now. According to the Trevor Project, an organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ youth, suicide is the third leading cause of death for 10- to 24-year-olds, and its the second leading cause of death on college campuses. Lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers. This is why an openly gay NBA player should be news, because it busts stereotypes, normalizes homosexuality and gives kids of all orientations a positive role model of self-love and professional excellence. Until there are no more hate crimes, no more vicious bullying and ugly slurs, whenever a person comes out â whether that person is a celebrity or a ""nobody"" â it should be celebrated like the triumph of courage it is. That is why it should be news. Jason Collins is tremendously brave and deserves to be celebrated as such. All that said, we aback to the question my dad would have asked. ""Yeah, but can the dude play?"" Yes, he can play. He's an aggressive, big man who holds his space on the court. At 34, he's probably aging out of the sport, but he's played consistently and well over the years and deserves to be remembered for what he has done on the court, not what he did while off. Opinion: Here's to Collins -- and the NBA . I applaud his career and his bravery, and I look forward to the day that sexual orientation is a non-issue. We are all so much more than our sexuality. It is vital to the situations in which it's important â namely, in looking for a mate â but it has nothing to do with job performance, whether your job is as a secretary or a professional basketball player. Our sexuality is just one of a thousand pieces of our identity, not the sole determining factor. Jason Collins is gay. That's not all he is, and it would be nice if we could keep this one piece of identity in context with the whole. Finally, it's nice to see institutionalized homophobia crumbling. First it was the military, with the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. For decades, the argument had been that having openly gay people in the military would impair unit cohesion. Setting aside all the flawed assumptions that undergird those fears, you know what has happened to unit cohesion since the fall of don't ask, don't tell? It's stayed the same or gotten slightly better. This is probably because it's easier for people to bond when they're not forbidden from being themselves. First, it was the military, now it's pro sports being forced to realize that there is no ""us"" and ""them"" when it comes to sexuality. We are all on the same team. I'll bet that Jason Collins will be the first in a string of professional athletes to openly acknowledge their homosexuality. You can also think of him as the next in a chain of civil rights pioneers. And I'll bet you'll start seeing them play a bit better. We're all at our best when we don't have to hide who we are, when we can bring it all to the court. I'm proud to see Jason come out and encouraged to see the overwhelmingly positive reaction he's received. And yet, I can't wait for the day we greet it with ""so what?"" and a yawn. I think my dad would agree. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile says her sports-fan dad would have been unconcerned about sexuality .
He'd have said, ""Yeah, but can the dude play?"" Competence not same as sexuality, she says .
She says orientation should be a yawn in a just world, but Collins' coming out hugely important .

"(CNN) -- Susan Patton kicked up a firestorm with her letter last week to the editor of The Daily Princetonian urging female students to find a man to marry before they graduate because ""the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be inextricably linked to the man you marry, and you will never again have this concentration of men who are worthy of you."" If only the Princeton alum's advice had come out 30 years earlier when I was in college, perhaps I could have avoided the costly mistake of focusing on what makes me come alive and then pursuing it for a living. Perhaps if I'd focused instead on nailing down a man by the time I was 22, I could be going to cocktail parties and co-opting my husband and children's successes, bragging about them as if they were my own, rather than being forced to talk about the current state of politics or what we can do as a society to engage the next generation in the struggles of today. Perhaps, if I'd had Ms. Patton's wisdom and foresight about what really matters in college, I wouldn't have taken so many pesky classes, and instead concentrated on designing my hair, makeup, attire and personality to create the perfect man-catching machine. Perhaps it would have all worked out exactly as Ms. Patton implies -- the perfect house, kids, husband and future. And yet I'm skeptical. I made a lot of stupid decisions in college; I'm really glad the choice of life partner wasn't one of them. How many people, do you think, could choose a tattoo at 22 years old and still be happy with it by the time they are 50? Let's be generous here: maybe a quarter of all people? And tattoos don't even talk. Choosing a life partner requires a maturity and self-awareness that I can't imagine more than a small fraction of college students have. I know I didn't. Not only that, but people change. Who you are at 22 is not who you will be at 35, and in my experience, the decade following college is the interval where the rate of change is the greatest. So while it may be tempting to imagine the white picket fence and 2.5 children I could have had with my hastily chosen college boyfriend, I can't help but think a divorce at 28 or 32 would have been more likely, had I chosen that route. What then, Ms. Patton? I find it refreshing that as the same-sex marriage debate swirls through society, Ms. Patton remains untouched in her heteronormativity. Does it even occur to her to question the premise that ""the cornerstone"" of a woman's future is finding a husband? No! Of course not! It simply must be. I haven't heard regressive rhetoric like this since I mistakenly tuned in Dr. Laura on the radio. I have to ask, what are lesbians supposed to do? Must they also find mates while in college, or are lesbians the only privileged group of women allowed to search for self-fulfillment before partnership? That said, Ms. Patton really must be commended for what has to be her grasp of satire. She knows the stereotype of Princeton is that it's filled with self-satisfied, conceited, bloviating jerks, and she captures that tone perfectly to make her point. Without such bold elitism -- an op-ed that took the perfectly defensible position that college is a target-rich environment free from the awkwardness of bars, set-ups or online dating -- there would have been no stir. Certainly it wouldn't have crashed the servers, and the women of Princeton might have spent another day thinking the future is filled with untold adventure and opportunity, rather than simply another day closer to their expiration date as a desirable partner. I applaud Ms. Patton for her bravery. There aren't a lot of well-educated women who would be courageous enough to completely sell out the feminist movement responsible for securing women's equal social, political and economic rights (to the degree that we have them) in favor of the 1950s' mentality that a woman's worth is determined by her marital status. Also, to come out with it while her youngest son remains unmarried? Brave. Though the ""universe of women he can marry is limitless,"" the universe of women who would be willing to be her daughter-in-law is finite. In all this advice to ""the daughters (she) never had,"" there is one point on which I cannot disagree with Ms. Patton: ""It's amazing how forgiving men can be about a woman's lack of erudition, if she is exceptionally pretty."" Perhaps Princeton should forgo academic requirements for its female students and instead teach ""How to Be Exceptionally Pretty."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: If only Susan Patton had offered her man-catching advice earlier .

"Washington (CNN) -- This weekend we pause to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation that set in motion the freeing of the slaves throughout the South. But as we focus on Abraham Lincoln's action on September 22, 1862, we should also realize that there was another crucial date in the story of freedom. Perhaps the most significant event in American history --other than the creation of the documents that created our nation -- was Abraham Lincoln's emancipation of the slaves in the District of Columbia on April 16, eight and a half months before the historic signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. It was the most significant because it began the process of stopping the one thing that could have ended this nation: slavery. The D.C. proclamation predated the Emancipation Proclamation by months, but it received no less attention from the nation. It was a highly controversial document, and it was the first and only time that the government tried to compensate owners for freeing the enforced laborers. Owners loyal to the United States were paid $300 per person, and each freed man, woman or child was paid $100 -- almost one-third of a working man's yearly wage in 1862 -- for those people who chose to return home. Compensating slaveholders was never tried again. Washington was a hub of the slave trade. Slaves were sold across from the White House in Lafayette Park. Slave pens, or jails, holding the slaves for sale were located throughout the District. Charles Ball, a slave in Washington, would take walks to Georgetown. ""I frequently saw large numbers of people of my color chained together in long trains, and driven off towards the South,"" he wrote. Frederick Douglass was one of Lincoln's most severe critics. For those unfamiliar with him, among man, Douglass stands beside Lincoln as a towering giant of the Civil War. Born a slave, Douglass, in his own words, ""stole this body"" and escaped to New Bedford, Massachusetts. Self-educated, Douglass became known nationwide. Lincoln invited him to the White House four times. (Twice for meetings, once to his second Inauguration and once to the Summer White House, which Douglass declined because he had a speaking engagement.) The first meeting changed Douglass' tune. After that conversation Douglass said, ""I felt as if I had known him all my life."" What was most important, Douglass had Lincoln's ear; the president listened. Ending the sale of slaves in the District was a thing of wonder. The act, said Douglass, was ""a priceless and an unspeakable blessing."" A District citizen (an African-American who was a free man all his life), wrote a friend in Baltimore, ""Were I a drinker I would get on a Jolly spree today, but as a Christian I can but kneel in prayer and bless God for the privilege I've enjoyed this day."" Because of the Civil War, the District's Emancipation Day was not formally celebrated until 1866, when 5,000 marched from the U.S. Capitol up Pennsylvania Avenue to Franklin Square, cheered by a crowd of 10,000 lining the way. Earlier this year, the District's non-voting member of Congress, the Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton, led Washington's celebration of Emancipation Day. Many years ago, her great-grandfather, Richard, lived in the city. President Lincoln's signature didn't free him. He freed himself when he walked away from a slave plantation in Virginia in the 1850's. But Lincoln's mighty pen made 3,100 men, women and children equal in the laws of the land. The congresswomen did more than simply honor legacy; she brought the emancipation legacy home to us now. She said that the city, unlike the 3,100 who were emancipated, could free itself of congressional rule. (Washington's citizens do not have senators and have but one non-voting representative in Congress. Congress must approve all legislation Washington's City Council enacts.) Norton said, ""Our freedom is locked up in the U.S. Capitol. We can claim it, or leave it there. ""We can claim it, or leave it there."" This fall, the descendants of slaves, millions of ethnic and religious minorities from other lands, African-Americans and immigrants -- Latinos, Asians, Europeans -- and women, as well as working- and middle-class Americans, will decide whether to claim their future. We are all in this together. All Americans will have a chance to move Lincoln's vision forward to help close the opportunity gap, to end the economic inequality resulting from government policies that favor a handful over the many who work equally hard. Abraham Lincoln would be proud to see the progress we have made. But he also would understand that there is still more work to do. Together. Claim it.

"(CNN) -- Who is Grover Norquist? He's a private citizen, a conservative lobbyist, the author of the Taxpayer's Protection Pledge and president of Americans for Tax Reform. His idea of tax reform is no more tax increases ever again. And no closed loopholes unless matched by cuts in government spending. In the 113th Congress, the one just elected that will begin in January, 219 of 234 Republicans in the House signed his tax pledge; in the Senate, nine of 41 Republican senators signed it. By contrast, before the 112th Congress, which is still in session, 248 representatives and 41 senators signed it. The drop in support has brought the pledge into the media limelight. Norquist says the pledge was made to the American people. But Norquist is the sole enforcer of the pledge, which he keeps in a fireproof safe in his office. No one has dared to challenge his self-appointed role as enforcer on behalf of American voters. Until this past week. Opinion: Who's afraid of Grover Norquist? Four Republican senators, among them South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, as well as Rep. Peter King of New York, said they would willingly ditch their pledge, in Lindsey's words, ""for the good of the country."" In an equally significant move, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole of the Republican Whip team told House Speaker John Boehner that he thought the Republicans should join President Barack Obama and immediately pass a tax extension for 98% of Americans who earn under $250,000. These declarations from Republican leaders are like political dynamite. And like well-placed dynamite, they might begin to break the logjam preventing effective leadership and legislation in Congress. Norquist, of course, doesn't think so. His tax pledge has bound most elected Republicans to him for 25 years. When King said that he felt his pledge was only for one Congress, Norquist compared the pledge to marriage vows, hinting King's wife should be worried. (I couldn't find ""till death do us part"" in the pledge. But then, I'm not a Republican). Your money: Is Grover's power overrated? King replied that Norquist was ""being a lowlife,"" words that caused almost an audible gasp among Republicans. You see, Norquist's pledge isn't about money; it's about loyalty. Next to Mitch McConnell's pledge to defeat Obama in 2012, Grover Norquist is the man most responsible for Republican lockstep voting and gridlock in Washington. That top Republicans are willing to openly defy Norquist's pledge and that any are willing to buck McConnell and Boehner are seminal events in recent American history. It means some Republican office holders are actually listening to what the voters said in the 2012 elections: Help the middle class, work together, stop the finger-pointing. But McConnell and his collaborators are proceeding as if the 2012 election never happened. He and other Republican ""leaders"" apparently intend to extend the Republican campaign, disregarding the election and the people's mandate. They intend to push the Republican agenda that voters overwhelmingly rejected at the voting booth and in post-election polls. Boehner claims that Congress received its own mandate. But Republicans lost seats in the House and the Senate that they had expected to win. Besides, as Harry Truman used to say, ""The president is the only elected official who represents all the people."" Read more: No-tax pledge has survived challenges before . John Podesta, President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, in writing about the fiscal cliff, said, ""Obama didn't win just because of demographics: He won on the economy. ... The electorate understood that a vote for Obama was a vote for policies that would help the middle class and the working poor."" Furthermore, ""the public has joined the majority of leading economists in recognizing that a strong middle class, not ever more generous benefits for the wealthy, as the true engine of economic growth."" The Peter Kings, Lindsey Grahams and Tom Coles of the Republican Party get it. There aren't enough cuts to offset $1 trillion in lost taxes from the excessive tax breaks the wealthy were given. The alternative is to harm our national security, weaken our defenses and cause some Americans to literally go without food. The Republican budget that passed the House, but not the Senate, before the election would cut food stamps as excess spending for unemployed parents. Extending the lesser tax breaks for 98% of all Americans is, indeed, a first order of business. Or as Cole said, ""It's the right thing to do."" There is money for these things. First, though, Republicans must break Norquist's insane hold on their party. More Republicans must put their country before someone else's agenda, and their Pledge of Allegiance before ""The Pledge"" to Norquist. It's merely a handful right now, but it looks as if the 75% of voters who approved of Obama's economic approach in exit polls to help the middle class and working poor are getting a voice in Congress.

"(CNN) -- Running for president is an expensive endeavor, but the cost isn't measured in dollars alone. Sure, we can count the $4 million in super PAC dollars Mitt Romney's allies just spent to tear down his Iowa opponents with negative ads. Indeed, Romney and his allies spent nearly $150 for every caucus vote he received in his eight-vote victory. But you can't put a price tag on the principles he sold out to the Tea Party in order to buy its extremists' support. Romney, who, Newt Gingrich likes to say, once ran to the left of Sen. Ted Kennedy, has scrambled in the past year to get to the right of Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. The same career politician who less than a decade ago told Massachusetts voters ""my views are progressive"" told South Carolinians last month, ""I line up pretty darn well with Tea Partiers."" In the same breath Romney called himself ""the ideal candidate"" of the right wing. As Romney now takes his dangerous promises and disregard for the middle class to New Hampshire on Tuesday, then South Carolina and beyond along the primary campaign trail -- and, he hopes, into the general election -- he's weighed down by heavy baggage. He belittled President Obama's $1,000 tax cut for typical middle-class families, deriding it as a ""little Band-Aid."" But Romney's own plan would give that same family just $54, savings even he admits is ""not a huge tax cut."" He doubled down on his misguided idea to ""let Detroit go bankrupt,"" even though the president's rescue of the auto industry saved more than 1.4 million American jobs up and down the supply chain, leading to a renaissance in the American car industry. Romney has also said he'd let the foreclosure process ""hit the bottom."" Presumably this is so investors can swing in and make a quick buck.  Drawing on his lucrative business experience of firing workers, off-shoring jobs, closing plants and bankrupting companies, Romney has a plan for the speculators, but not the families who stand to lose their homes. He promised to veto the DREAM Act and deny young illegal immigrants the chance to earn a path to citizenship if they give back to the only country they've ever known by serving in the military or going to college. He backed the right-wing Republican budget that would eventually end Medicare as we know it, gut Social Security and slash funding for higher education. He criticized the president for ending the war in Iraq, saying he would rather leave 30,000 troops on the ground with no clear mission or plan for withdrawal. And the icing on the Tea Party cake? He has repackaged the same policies that caused the financial crisis -- mistakes like making the middle class pay for tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations and letting Wall Street write its own rules so big bankers can make millions while gambling with everyone else's economic security. These Tea Party-coddling promises may have won Romney a caucus, but he'll find they come at a cost -- to his own candidacy and, even more distressingly, to us. To you and me, a Romney presidency would mean four years of out-of-control college and healthcare costs. It would mean less responsibility for everyone to do their fair share, but more families losing their jobs and their homes. But that's the price Romney is willing to pay for the support of the far right. Once the primary is over, though, Romney will have to move back to the middle. Independent voters aren't going to like the lengths to which Romney has married himself to the Republican Party's extremist elements. The American people can't afford to give him a pass. Romney said he wants to be the Tea Party's ""ideal candidate,"" but by adopting the principles of a group that doesn't speak for mainstream Republicans -- let alone the majority of the Americans he hopes to lead -- he could be falling in with the wrong crowd at the expense of the middle class. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Romney sells out history of moderate principles to get Tea Party support .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ralph Nader floated the idea this week that a primary challenge to President Obama will help the president and the country. He is flat-out wrong. His views are based on a faulty premise and a myth. We will start with the faulty premise and get to the myth later. Remember back to 2000, when Nader himself ran as a third-party candidate? He's not proposing that here -- at least not yet -- but it's important to remember what happens when Nader gets involved in challenging a Democrat. In 2000, he siphoned enough votes from Al Gore in Florida to swing the election to President Bush. It gave us eight years of Bush-Cheney politics and policies. If Nader were being honest with himself, he'd look to 2000 as an example of what the consequences can be for the country and progressive causes when progressives don't stick together. A primary challenge could further divide the party and possibly dampen Democratic enthusiasm. These races could erode our ability to reach swing voters, who are crucial to electoral viability, by forcing candidates to draw a sharper contrast on issues than necessary to win an election. On most issues, Nader agrees with the Democrats more than the Republicans. By running as an independent and drawing votes in Florida that might otherwise have gone to Gore, Nader helped usher in eight of the worst years our country has ever seen. Bush ignored or trampled on Nader's major concerns. Look at the record: Bush took President Clinton's budget surplus and squandered it. He used part of the surplus to offset the costs of his tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. He used the rest to begin funding an elective war in Iraq. Bush policies allowed predatory lenders to dupe families seeking mortgages for homes. Wall Street bankers got the green light to play by their own rules. Bush created the bubble that burst and continues to rain on us. Bush policies cost millions of Americans their jobs. Middle class workers watched as their wages stagnated. They looked on helplessly as corporate executives reaped obese compensation. Obama took over an economy that was shedding 750,000 jobs every month. He came into office with the nation in two wars and with crumbling bridges and superhighways, a health insurance system financially crippling middle class families, plus multiple other domestic maladies. We will be dealing with the repercussions of Bush's eight years for generations. And Nader thinks a primary challenge is a good idea? The question is for whom? Primary challenges against moderates or centrist candidates work both ways. Does Nader suppose the primary challenges in November that wiped out veteran moderate Republican legislators and left the national GOP where it is today -- with energized extreme right-wing purists almost in control -- was good? Does he really want to be the Democratic Party's equivalent of a tea party purist? Nader knows there is another progressive activist: Cornel West, who also seeks to stir a primary challenge against Obama. West has honest but debatable differences with President Obama. He rightly should challenge every politician to wage a battle against poverty and injustice in the United States. I see no reason for West to go beyond his rhetorical challenge to the president to address these issues and hold every elected official more accountable to the middle class and working poor. Here's ""the myth"": Nader's and West's advocacy of primary challenges is based on the premise that Obama neither speaks to nor fights for progressive ideals. They're wrong. Look at what Obama has done, with pit bull opposition fighting him inch by inch. Obama repeatedly called for a tax system in which all people pay their fair share, including the wealthiest Americans. The steep deficit cut Obama proposed this week mandates even-handed taxing and closes the tax loopholes that CEOs use to slide by with paying taxes at lower rates than their own secretaries do. Our country witnessed the end of ""don't ask, don't tell"" this week. That finally allows brave men and women to serve openly and proudly in our armed forces, regardless of their sexual orientation. In less than 30 months, the president signed health insurance reform that expanded everyone's access to quality, affordable health care. He outlawed the use of those so-called pre-existing conditions that forced many Americans to go without health insurance or pay exorbitant premiums. He signed the Fair Pay Act to end workplace discrimination and to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work. He appointed two highly qualified women, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, to the Supreme Court. For the first time in our history, there are three female justices. The question facing progressives is not whether Obama should have a primary challenger. Rather, it is: Do they want to return to the disastrous economic and social policies advocated by the tea party and the Republican presidential candidates today? As Gore's former campaign manager, no one knows more than I do what the consequences are of efforts like Nader's. If he and West care about the progressive causes they purport to hold dear, they won't, still once again, risk putting another Republican -- and perhaps another swashbuckling governor from Texas -- in the White House. America cannot afford to go backward. It's time progressives unite for change we all believe in.

"(CNN) -- Every third Monday in January we gather as Americans to commemorate the values and beliefs -- as well as the ultimate sacrifice -- of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His tireless advocacy for civil rights, equal protection under the law, labor rights, and for the ultimate realization of our essential creed that we are ""one nation, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" is taught in every school in America, and is now enshrined in a memorial on the National Mall. Dr. King believed so strongly not only in these values, but also in the moral imperative to heed the ""fierce urgency of now."" He knew that in the face of injustice no moral man or woman can stay silent -- and he paid for it with his life. He was a ""drum major for justice"" He inspired us -- not just with his eloquent sermons, rich in purpose; or his speeches, inspiring and provocative -- but he challenged us with his dream, his daring imagination: to see an America where all of God's children would be equal; all of God's children would have a seat at the table. Dr. King, along with other men and women of his generation did not just see the barriers. They believed in the opportunities that could be realized if we could just move beyond racial inequality and injustice. He truly believed that we had to ""take the first step in faith, even when you don't see the whole staircase."" Just take the first step. I've written and spoken about Dr. King many times, but this year, one area of his crusade seems particularly worthy of remembrance: the fight for the ballot. Prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, African-Americans and many others faced regular and malicious restrictions to the free exercise of their constitutionally protected right to vote, especially in my native South. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses: many insidious techniques were used by certain states to restrict, confuse, and write off, marginalize and disenfranchise so many eligible citizens from voting simply because of the color of their skin. Southern governors and those in Washington comfortable with the status quo hid behind arguments about ""states rights."" Yet these laws were little more than legislated racism and all knew the real goal behind their unequal effects. In a 1957 speech titled ""Give Us The Ballot,"" Dr. King spoke plainly about the imperative of equal voting rights. ""So long as I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the right to vote I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my mind Ã¢â¬â it is made up for me. I cannot live as a democratic citizen, observing the laws I have helped to enact Ã¢â¬â I can only submit to the edict of others."" For Dr. King, the right to vote was sacrosanct and foundational. It is the very essence of our social contract. Free elections create legitimacy. They imply the consent of the governed. He knew that unfair elections laws did not just hurt minorities or the working poor, they rendered hollow the very essence of American government. It's a message that's as true today as it was then. The 47-year old Voting Rights Act has stood the test of time, but there are new obstacles to the ballot springing up in today's America. Around the country, conservatives in state legislatures are attempting to put fresh roadblocks in the path of this most basic right. The latest vogue in anti-suffrage legislation is mandatory photo ID laws. From Tennessee to Texas, from Wisconsin to Pennsylvania, conservative Republicans and their allies are implementing laws that undermine, even flout, the Voting Rights Act. The Justice Department has begun to challenge these laws, opposing new efforts in South Carolina and Florida. Laws in other states that have deep histories of discrimination, such as Texas and Mississippi, are also being examined. But many states, refusing to pass neutrally applicable laws, have vowed instead to sue the federal government in court. These laws disproportionately impact minority communities -- groups much more likely than white voters to lack photo identification for reasons as simple as the fact that they may not own a car and use the city bus to get to work. According a study published in 2006 by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, as many as 23 million American citizens -- that's 11% of those of voting age -- lack the government-issued photo ID many of these laws demand. Keep in mind, this is not just a racial issue. Older Americans are less likely to have these IDs, as are lower-income Americans. College students, who already face challenges based on their seasonal residency, will face an even greater burden than they did previously. Dr. King demanded that all Americans be given the ballot. We must demand today that we keep it. Demand to keep the ballot because our laws must be made by all of us. Demand to keep the ballot because an election where 23 million can't vote is an election that undermines democracy.

"(CNN) -- Tuesday, Attorney General Eric Holder delivers a major speech on voting rights at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas. The location is significant: In 1965, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, a landmark piece of civil rights legislation that banned the worst forms of racial discrimination in American elections. Over the past five decades, the VRA and other federal and state election reforms have greatly expanded access to the ballot box. As a testament to their success, the 2008 presidential electorate was the largest and most demographically diverse in the history of the United States. But the protections the VRA affords have not lost their relevance, or their indispensability. In the past year, lawmakers in 40 states have introduced legislation that would make it harder for all eligible Americans to vote -- and harder disproportionately for people of color, young Americans, and our seniors. Some Southern states, like Florida, South Carolina, and Texas, have not only passed legislation restricting the right to vote, but also have refused to comply with their responsibilities under the VRA. The law requires certain states with histories of voting discrimination to submit any change in election law to the U.S. Department of Justice for ""preclearance"" before it can be implemented. Because these states for so long flaunted an obstinate refusal to allow African-Americans equal access to the voting booth, the VRA requires they demonstrate that new changes will not have a discriminatory effect. South Carolina and Texas both passed requirements that voters present restrictive forms of government-issued photo ID at polling places, even though 25% of African-Americans and 19% of Latinos lack the necessary form of ID. After passing their laws, both of these states filed preclearance letters with DOJ, but neither could explain how the new law avoided repeating an abhorrent history of discrimination. Florida severely restricted voter registration drives, although minority voters register through drives at twice the rate of white voters. The Sunshine State also cut early voting, the process through which more than half of the state's African-Americans cast ballots in 2008. Florida implemented its restrictive bill in violation of the VRA and only submitted the legislation for preclearance after it was sued in federal court. When DOJ questioned the discriminatory impact of these changes, Florida removed the most controversial parts of its law from the department's consideration and instead asked a federal court to excuse it from its obligations under the VRA. These states are seemingly unable and have clearly failed to craft election laws that will affect all equally. And, apparently, they don't even want to. Rather than work toward solutions that allow more eligible Americans to vote, some states have filed lawsuits arguing that parts of the VRA -- one of our nation's most successful pieces of civil rights legislation -- are unconstitutional. Ensuring that all citizens can exercise their right to vote extends beyond just those states with significant histories of race discrimination. In 2011, many other states have embarked on voter suppression efforts. In a new report, ""Defending Democracy,"" the NAACP and NAACP Legal Defense Fund examine the past year's assault on voting, demonstrating that the ""onslaught of restrictive measures"" was ""designed to stem electoral strength among communities of color."" This is only the latest in a series of reports highlighting the wrongheadedness of this movement against voting rights. Earlier this month, the Democratic National Committee's Voting Rights Institute released a major report which said Republicans have undertaken this effort purely for partisan gain. Earlier this year, the Brennan Center for Justice and Advancement Project also released substantial reports. Testifying before Congress in November, Holder said that legislation aimed at voter suppression is ""inconsistent with what we say we are as a nation."" I couldn't agree more. Johnson signed the VRA to ensure that the right to vote extended to all Americans, regardless of their race. The VRA was more than just another federal law; it was -- and remains -- the embodiment of years of struggle, resulting from countless sacrifices of brave men and women who built the civil rights movement. We must not allow a new generation of restrictions to condition the right to vote on arbitrary qualifications and discriminatory rules. I welcome Holder's voice to the chorus of millions of Americans who have defended the sanctity of the vote. And I hope that DOJ will continue to move our nation forward and protect every eligible citizen's fundamental right to vote.

"(CNN) -- ""No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that I was born and raised."" With that comment to a crowd in Michigan, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney officially embraced the ""birther"" movement and touched off a firestorm of protest across the airwaves and internet. Of course, those protesting didn't include his live audience or the extremists on the right. Nor, given Romney's embrace of Donald Trump, should we be surprised by this joke-that's-not-a-joke. Ari Melber of The Nation put it succinctly: ""Jokes can be more revealing than talking points."" But what, exactly, did Romney reveal with this pre-meditated ""offhand"" remark? That he's courting the radical right? He already chose Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee. That he's pandering to the right-wing noise machine and the corporate special interest propaganda machine? We already know that because he appears on media friendly to the right but limits the number and kind of questions reporters can ask him, and then responds with dodging answers. Opinion: Election a stark choice on America's future . That he's following the Bush-Cheney-Rove ""keep it vague, keep them afraid"" playbook? Commentators and analysts have been pointing this out since Romney entered the campaign. Romney -- hiding behind the plausible deniability that it was just a joke, with a wink and a nod to the extremists in his base -- tried to divert attention from the ABC's haunting his campaign: Akin, Bain, ""Corporations are people."" His comment has the added benefit of satisfying his most fervent supporters and those anonymous supporters bankrolling one of the most misleading advertising campaigns, a blitzkrieg that strikes just the right partisan undertones. The real story is that there's nothing unusual about the remark. It's no more in the gutter than a lot of things that have been said about President Barack Obama since coming into office. It's just one more insinuation designed to distract us from the most disconcerting weaknesses of Romney's candidacy -- that he fails to offer details about his policy proposals and stubbornly refuses to disclose more than two years of tax returns. But it is sad and revealing, nevertheless. It is sad that a campaign stretch that began with his asking Obama to stop apologizing for America (something fact checkers noted the president never did) and roundly debunked welfare attack ad ended with a xenophobic and roundly debunked birther reference. And it reveals not just moral turpitude, but moral vacuity. His birth certificate dog-whistles are not just desperate, they are deliberate. Romney is campaigning as if he feels he is entitled to the White House -- that, like a feudal lord or European aristocrat, he does not have to answer questions, he does not have to be forthright, he does not have to be honest. It also reveals, as so much before it has done, that he believes the American people are too ignorant, too indifferent, too lazy, too afraid to bother and that we can be fooled. He also knows that the American press will, after huffing and puffing, give him a free pass on this one, too. How we respond to Romney's remark will reveal a lot about us, as well. Will we get what he's doing? Will we reject the noxious condescension and the patronizing? Will we demand an open and honest accounting of his business dealings? If he wants to be in charge of our business, we should see how he's run his. Isaac could hinder GOP chance to define Romney at convention . The media, too, will reveal a lot about itself by its response. Outrage, shock, tongue-clicking - these are superficial and useless. Allowing Romney to backpedal -- ""it's only a joke"" -- misses the point. The media needs to press for policy specifics and contrast claims with facts. As I said, we shouldn't be surprised by Romney's remark. Trying to pretend that somehow Obama is not an American-born leader, or questioning his patrioism, or his values by using the Big Lie often speaks in code. But let's decode some of the implications: . -- Show us your birth certificate, but I won't show you my tax returns. -- You need to prove your identity to vote, but my super PAC allies don't need to identify their donors. -- I'll lie about Obama's plans, but won't explain my own. -- I'll blame Obama for the problems he didn't cause, and take credit for his solutions that work. Romney's birther remark was less a surprise than a confirmation that his moral compass is off center. Mr. Romney, America's not an aristocracy. It's not where you were born -- in a cabin or a mansion -- or how you were raised -- in poverty by a single parent or with money and privilege -- that matters. It matters where you go and what you do. It's who you help, what you're willing to sacrifice, and how honest you are. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Mitt Romney's birth certificate ""joke"" wasn't innocuous .

"(CNN) -- The United States and Mexico agreed Monday to work cooperatively on exploring and developing oil and natural gas reserves along their maritime border. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar attended the signing of the pact known as the Transboundary Agreement in Los Cabos, Mexico, with Patricia Espinosa, the Mexican foreign relations minister. The agreement requires approval by the U.S. and Mexican national legislatures. According to a statement by the U.S. Interior Department, the agreement will open up almost 1.5 million acres of U.S. outer continental shelf to exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves. The area, roughly the size of Delaware, is estimated by the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to contain up to 172 million barrels of oil and 304 billion cubic feet of natural gas, the department statement said. ""This agreement makes available promising areas in the resource-rich Gulf of Mexico and establishes a clear process by which both governments can provide the necessary oversight to ensure exploration and development activities are conducted safely,"" Salazar said in the statement. The Transboundary Agreement creates a framework for Mexico's state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) to work with U.S. oil and gas companies in developing the maritime boundary area. It follows the commitment last year by U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon to work out an agreement on developing the maritime border reserves.","The United States and Mexico sign an agreement to cooperate on energy development .

"(CNN) -- The most important decision Mitt Romney has made in his campaign so far, the selection of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan for his running mate, tells us two things -- and neither bears good news for the middle class. First, Romney has fully and unequivocally embraced the extreme Ryan budget plan. Earlier this year, he called it ""marvelous"" -- now he's made it his own. The Romney-Ryan plan would throw seniors under the bus and undermine their health security by ending Medicare as we know it. It would increase health care costs for seniors, including those on fixed income, by thousands of dollars a year. The extreme plan proposed by this year's Republican ticket would bring huge tax breaks to millionaires, paid for by tax hikes on the middle class, and massive cuts to investments that strengthen the middle class -- priorities like education, health care, energy and scientific and medical research. Whether you are a college student trying to pay for school, a veteran worried about your health benefits, or a senior worried about retirement security, the Romney-Ryan plan is bad news. It would have devastating real-world effects on people young and old across the country. By the numbers: Paul Ryan . Romney and Ryan have put ideology ahead of what's right. They refuse to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans under any circumstance -- not another dime, ever. Unlike the Bowles-Simpson deficit reduction plan or the president's balanced plan to reduce the deficit that include asking everyone to pay their fair share, the Romney-Ryan budget would reduce the deficit on the backs of seniors and the middle class. Even the U.S. Conference of Bishops admonished the Romney-Ryan plan. So did a group of nuns who recently traveled by bus across the country with the message that our budget is not just our country's fiscal map, it is our moral one. They rightly pointed out that, as it says in Corinthians, ""If one part suffers, every part suffers with it, if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it."" On the political front, Ryan's selection is yet another sign that Romney is running to the far right and is the most extreme conservative candidate we have had in generations. The embrace of an ideologue like Paul Ryan may appeal to the Republican Party's Tea Party base, but it will completely alienate independent voters, especially in battleground states. Opinion: Paul Ryan and Gen X GOP . Seniors in Ohio and Florida have every reason to worry what a Romney-Ryan administration would do to them when Medicare is handed over to private insurance companies and Social Security is subject to the whims of Wall Street. Voters should also consider that, even as our nation faces threats of terrorism and remains at war, for the first time in modern presidential history the Republican ticket lacks any national security credentials. It's no coincidence, then, that its views on national security are dangerous and ill-considered. Any voter wondering about our leaders' values should consider what they do in the room when the tough decisions are on the table. While President Obama was in the Oval Office, making the toughest calls any president has had to make -- how to save the economy from depression, rescue the American auto industry, bring affordable health care to millions of Americans or take out Osama bin Laden -- Paul Ryan was in a different room. How Romney campaign kept Ryan tap under wraps . He was sitting side-by-side with fellow House Republican ideologues John Boehner and Eric Cantor as they risked the full faith and credit of the United States, regardless of what it would mean for the middle class, jobs and women's rights. If there ever was a question about what this election is about, today's announcement answers it. Throughout this campaign, Mitt Romney has lacked a clear vision. Now he's embraced a radical ideologue with a dangerous one. This election is absolutely a choice between two visions for our country's future. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have solidified their roles as rubber stamps for the reckless and failed economic theories of the past. Watch CNN tonight at 7 and 10 ET for an in-depth look at Paul Ryan and the next steps for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.

"(CNN) -- It seems everyone -- except perhaps the die-hard NFL fan -- agrees that the most important event scheduled for next week is the first presidential debate. I say ""scheduled"" because you never know what the news cycle will kick in. Snickers might have a new chocolate bar. Or something. The pundits and politicians and the news media and the late-night comedians are salivating over the debate. Maybe the football fans should be jealous, because the debate is being ""played"" like a game -- who will win, and by how much, rather than as a serious exchange of ideas or contrast of visions. Yes, the debates are important, but the political and economic conditions of the times are probably more important. Some debates have helped decide elections; others have just clarified the electoral winds. Usually, the challenger has the advantage. He (and perhaps someday she) can go on the offensive. Being on the same stage with the president, who also has to defend his record, results in an automatic elevation of stature -- regardless of who's taller. Overall, an incumbent president has more to lose. Still, whether a debate alone can win or lose an election is itself open to debate. Every debate produces a gaffe and a few lines for the late-night comedians. Whether that's enough to change the momentum of a campaign isn't so clear. Most experts agree that the very first televised debate, that between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960, did change the momentum and direction of that election. Opinion: How can President Obama win the first debate? Nixon certainly learned his lesson, refusing to debate in 1968 or 1972. In the second presidential debate of 1976, Max Frankel of The New York Times asked President Gerald Ford about the Soviet influence in Eastern Europe. Ford said, ""There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration."" Astounded, Frankel gave Ford a chance to modify his response, but Ford elaborated, saying, ""I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union."" Or the Yugoslavians or Romanians, he added -- two countries whose rebellions the Soviet Union had crushed. That was a jaw-dropper, and Carter said the debates gave him credibility. But just two years earlier Nixon resigned in disgrace and the country remained torn by the Vietnam legacy. So perhaps Ford's odd declaration only highlighted an inherent political weakness. In 1980, Ronald Reagan, thanks to several decades of acting experience, looked presidential, selling himself to the American people as he had earlier sold them 20 Mule Team Borax. When Carter said Reagan would cut Medicare, Reagan, who'd been complaining that Carter had been misrepresenting him, quipped, ""There you go again."" And he ended with the now famous, ""Are you better off than you were four years ago?"" But Carter didn't help his cause when he ended by saying he'd asked his teenage daughter, Amy, to tell him the biggest issue of the day (the answer concerned nuclear weapons). And inflation was at 13.5%, the country was in an energy crisis and the Iran hostage situation made Carter look weak. In 1984, Reagan's zinger about own age -- ""I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience"" -- cost Walter Mondale the election, according to Mondale. But with the economy turning around and Reagan's popular ""cowboy"" stance against the Soviet Union apparently restoring American prestige abroad, the president already had a commanding lead in the polls before the debate. In 1988, we had Michael Dukakis' convoluted, wooden response to a hypothetical question about whether he would impose the death penalty if someone raped and murdered his wife. But Dukakis was done in by Reagan's legacy, his own PR ineptness and a ""dirty tricks"" campaign worthy of Nixon (see Willie Horton). In 1992, viewers thought if anybody won the debates, it was third-party candidate Ross Perot, but President George H.W. Bush looked detached at times when he looked at his watch. Clinton was more personable. Opinion: Fox's laughable case for Romney . By 1996, the incumbent Clinton had a commanding lead over the 73-year-old war veteran Bob Dole, who looked tired. Youthful vigor won. Given the disputed results of the 2000 cycle, it's hard to say what impact the debates had. But I will never forget the expectations game. Karl Rove, then George W. Bush's chief strategist, pronounced that Al Gore was the ""world's most pre-eminent debater."" Expectations were exceedingly high for us. Gore was prepared, but perhaps too prepared. He was anxious, and the split screen didn't do us any favors. We lost the debate on body language and sighing, not substance. Nixon's revenge, I guess. In 2004, Bush was a wartime president. While the challenger, Sen. John Kerry, got under his skin in the first debate, Bush still managed to keep his cool under intense rhetorical fire. In 2008, revulsion against Bush's economic and foreign policies, the Great Recession and the candidacy of Sarah Palin overshadowed the debates between John McCain and Barack Obama. So a good debate performance or a poor one can make a difference, but conditions in the country and how voters perceive the candidates probably matter more. The debates this year will certainly have their moments. But both candidates are already so well-known, the memorable lines will probably reinforce, rather than change, voters' perceptions.

"(CNN) -- As we prepare to celebrate Earth Day on Sunday, let us not forget that Friday marks the second anniversary of the start of the BP oil spill. It deserves more than a shrug, an ""oh, yeah,"" and ""how's the fishing?"" It deserves more than a solemn voiced announcer relegating it to a ""this day in history,"" with a picture from the archives to jog our memory. Sometimes, a tragedy has its own tragedy: It has its day, or week, or month in the news cycle; then time passes and other things happen. We move on, directed by the media and politicians, to the next great outrage. In so doing, we may lose the why and the wherefore -- the things that caused us, through the lens and the pen, to be interested, involved, invested in a tragedy not our own. And we then forget just what made us a community, if only for a moment. As Desmond Tutu said: ""My humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together."" Dear Reader, share with me, for a few minutes, the humanity of the Deepwater Horizon. For I am a daughter of the Gulf South, and this is personal -- though, as is often the case, the personal is universal. When the Deepwater Horizon well exploded, 11 people died. Not a lot of people, in the sense that they measure tragedies. But ""every individual is a world."" Eleven worlds exploded, and they had satellites -- spouses, children, siblings, parents, friends and neighbors -- still affected, still reeling out of orbit, still trying to cope with a void that can never be filled. Others lost their livelihood. We call the work we do ""making a living."" If we lose a job, we can hopefully, eventually, find another. But if we lose a ""living"" -- a way of life -- what then? The fishermen and their support network -- their satellites and dependents -- were crippled by the oil spill. Yes, the seafood industry has begun to recover, but it still limps. Tragedy affects our lives and our livelihoods. But it also affects our environment and the creatures that make it habitable, beautiful -- and profitable. Two years ago, we cringed at the pictures of the oil-soaked pelicans, the turtles and fish drowned in oil; we were repulsed by the images of wetlands and marshes greasy, with slimeballs surfacing. Do we know the status of the fauna and flora today? And we cheered the rescue efforts, we donated, we educated ourselves about ecosystems and coastal waterways and environmental interconnectedness. Do we have a minute on this anniversary to continue our education, to donate again to our ecological survival? I felt anger two years ago, as oil spewed into my beloved Gulf. I was so angry, and words seemed as helpless as the birds and the marshes. How stupid. How arrogant. How greedy. Why don't they do something? When the governor and the local politicians railed and ranted and demanded and got their airtime, I'll be honest: I cheered. I felt righteous indignation vicariously justified. Nor was the anger misplaced. BP was at fault. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill wasn't an unavoidable accident. It resulted from negligence and avarice. Profit first, responsibility second. I am reminded of what Shirley Chisholm once said: ""When morality comes up against profit, it is seldom that profit loses."" But there is profit, and there is profit, and there are moral lessons in every tragedy -- practical lessons that bring us from the personal to the universal. Over the past two years, I have reflected, off and on, about dismay and anger and lessons, and I think I've discovered three in the Deepwater Horizon. First, only Big Business has the resources to clean up its own mess. The federal government had neither the technicians nor the knowledge to stop the oil from gushing into the Gulf and sliming our shores, the barrier islands, marine life, our way of life and food supply. Second, and as a consequence, the philosophy that government should stay out of the way of Big Business primes the pump of disaster. I don't want Big Brother in my life any more than the most fervent tea party Republican does. But, brother patriot, let me tell you a fact of life: We need the federal government to act as umpire. Only Big Government is big enough to keep Big Business from thumbing its nose at the public welfare, and besmirching the public's health and safety. There's a reason the Constitution begins, ""We the people in order to ... promote the common welfare ..."" Third, there's something wrong with the philosophy that almost any regulation is overregulation. No, we should have done something before the spill. We should have regulated BP and watched it closely, instead of giving it a pass to do as it pleased. To modify a clichÃÂ©, an ounce of regulation is worth many pounds of rectification. But in remembering this event, let us never lose sight that we're all in this together. And when disaster strikes -- natural or man-made -- we must find the will to rebuild safer and stronger than before.

"(CNN) -- Incomes? Home prices? New car sales? Americans exactingly measure everything that pertains to their material well-being. But when it comes time to assess the things that matter most -- human well-being and happiness -- there we find ourselves baffled. This week, Americans celebrate Valentine's Day. The National Retail Federation can inform us how much Americans will spend and how that spending compares to last year and the year before that. It can tell us how much of that spending will be directed to candy, how much to cards, how much to lingerie, how much to dinners out. Specialists will inform you, if asked, about the relative size of the gay and lesbian Valentine market, how many Valentine dollars will be spent on pets, and how Valentine's Day spending compares to Halloween and Cinco de Mayo. But what the Valentine dollars buy? That is a lot more obscure. The lost art of offline dating . The statisticians can tell us that 31 million Americans live alone, and that fewer than half of American homes are shared by a husband and wife. Their data shows that the American birth rate plunged to an all-time low in 2011, and that almost one-fifth of American women in their 40s have not had children. But the statisticians cannot tell us what we most want to know: Are these trends conducive to human flourishing? Are we doing a better or worse job of sustaining love and family compared to other places and other times? These questions -- the very most important of them all -- are the questions where our public discussion is most accepting of answers based on raw assertion. ""Living alone comports with modern values. It promotes freedom, personal control and self-realization."" That sunny assessment comes from Eric Klinenberg, author of the 2012 book, ""Going Solo."" Maybe he's right -- go try to prove he's not! The hookup culture of commitment-free sex? It's empowering, claims a new book excerpted in The Atlantic. ""To put it crudely, feminist progress right now largely depends on the existence of the hookup culture. And to a surprising degree, it is women -- not men -- who are perpetuating the culture, especially in school, cannily manipulating it to make space for their success, always keeping their own ends in mind. "" Are more children growing up in single-parent households? That's a good thing, asserts journalism professor Katie Roiphe in a New York Times op-ed. The upside of online dating: Always a funny story to tell . ""If you think that being married ensures a good life for your children you need only enter a bookstore and open any novel, or go to the theater and watch practically any play, or have dinner with nearly anyone you know. Suffering is everywhere, and married parents, even happily married parents, raise screwed-up or alcoholic or lost children, just as single parents raise strong, healthy ones,"" Roiphe writes. If we were reading about running-shoe production, or the relative costs of different sources of electricity, or the merits of different mobile phones, we'd want facts and proof. But when it comes to the things that matter most, proof is difficult and our feelings are strong. How technology has changed romance . ""People don't actually read newspapers,"" quipped the great student of mass media, Marshall McLuhan. ""They slip into them like a warm bath."" We want to hear that Facebook can substitute for the marriages we don't form, and that friends and pets provide more gratification than the children we don't have. We want to believe that we can shed sexual partners without a pang and attract new ones at every age of life.

"(CNN) -- Belgian defender Vincent Kompany said this week there would be a ""commotion"" in Belgium if his country failed to qualify for next year's World Cup. After Friday's win against Serbia, Belgium, with its so-called golden generation of players, is getting closer to Brazil. The Red Devils, who last appeared at soccer's showpiece event in 2002, beat Serbia 2-1 in qualifying. Kevin De Bruyne and Marouane Fellaini scored headed goals in each half in Brussels to lift Belgium to 19 points in Group A. Kompany's club teammate at Manchester City, Aleksandar Kolarov, pulled a goal back for Serbia in the 88th minute. De Bruyne, who also set up Fellaini's effort, could be the next Belgian to move to the Premier League -- he's being linked with Chelsea. The majority of players Belgium used on Friday ply their trade in England's top division. Belgium received a further boost, guaranteed of at least second spot, when Croatia blew an opportunity to go level on points with three matches remaining. Despite registering nearly 20 shots, Croatia was upset 1-0 by Scotland in Zagreb. Elsewhere, Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal defeated Russia 1-0 to move into top spot ahead of Fabio Capello's men in Group F. Postiga winner . Veteran striker Helder Postiga netted on a tap-in in the ninth minute in Lisbon to end Russia's perfect 4-0 record. Portugal, which qualified for the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 courtesy of playoff victories against Bosnia-Herzegovina, improved to 14 points, although Russia possesses two games in hand. Ireland and Austria recorded victories to rise to 11 points in Group C as they seek to nail down second place behind runaway leader Germany. Robbie Keane celebrated becoming Ireland's most capped player -- he made his 126th appearance to surpass goalkeeper Shay Given -- by scoring all of Ireland's goals in a 3-0 win against the Faroe Islands in Dublin. ""There was a lot of talk about getting the record caps but that was almost in the back of my mind,"" Keane said. Even with Zlatan Ibrahimovic in its ranks, Sweden fell 2-1 to Austria in Vienna. Johan Elmander, not Ibrahimovic, tallied for the visitor with eight minutes remaining. Sweden, though, will be favored to reach 11 points next week, as it faces the Faroe Islands. Ukraine, co-host of Euro 2012, did England a favor in Group H by topping group leader Montenegro 4-0 away from home. Ukraine took the lead early in the second half -- after being reduced to 10 men -- with Montenegro then having two players dismissed as its frustration grew. Montenegro leads the group with 14 points, two more than England and three more than Ukraine but with a game more played. Away wins for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Greece, over Latvia and Lithuania, respectively, leave Bosnia-Herzegovina three points ahead of Greece in Group G. More trouble for Mario . Although in little danger of not qualifying from Group B, there was a sour note for Italy in its 0-0 draw at the Czech Republic. Striker Mario Balotelli, no stranger to controversy, was dismissed in the second half after receiving two yellow cards. He struck defender Theodor Gebre Selassie in the face with a forearm to receive his marching orders. ""Balotelli should control himself better -- he allowed himself to be provoked,"" Italy coach Cesare Prandelli told reporters.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court will hear arguments this week in two same-sex marriage cases. Whatever the justices do, the outcome seems foreordained. When 80% of Americans under 30 agree about something, that something will happen -- it's only a matter of time. But while straight young Americans support marriage for gays, increasingly they opt against marriage for themselves. Nearly half of American children, 48%, are now born to unmarried women. Among women without college degrees, and of all races, unwed motherhood has become the norm. This is the crisis of the American family. Whether same-sex marriage proceeds fast or slow, whether it extends to all 50 states or stops with the current nine plus the District of Columbia, the crisis will be the same. Marriage and the Supreme Court: Five things to watch . Children born to single parents face much longer odds in life than children born to married parents. (A new study by ThirdWay.org suggests that the harms are especially intense for boys, less so for girls.) ""Odds"" are not rules, of course. There are always exceptions. On average, however, children born to married mothers and fathers are more likely to finish college, more likely to avoid prison and more likely to form marriages themselves than children born to single parents. And precisely because the harms of single parenthood tend to be self-replicating, the breakdown of marriage threatens to harden into a caste divide, with some families launched into cycles of downward mobility because of the unstable relationships of parents or grandparents or great-grandparents. For 20 years, Americans have fiercely debated whether gays -- who constitute maybe 3% of the population -- should be allowed to marry each other. Meanwhile, Americans have given short shrift to what is happening to the 97% of the population that is allowed to marry, but increasingly opts not to do so. Chief Justice Roberts' lesbian cousin to attend same-sex marriage hearings . One reason we've given the single-parenthood problem short shrift is that we lack good ideas about how to address it. The core of the problem seems to be the decline of male wages relative to female wages. The New York Times this week quoted an MIT economist, Michael Greenstone: . ""I think the greatest, most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out 'You need more education' and have been able to respond to that, and men have not. And it's very, very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals. And men are not. It's a fact in need of an explanation."" As men (on average) finish less education, as male wages (on average) decline, men become less attractive as marital partners. As Harvard's Christopher Jencks -- a left-leaning academic, it should be stressed -- said in that same New York Times piece: ""Single-parent families tend to emerge in places where the men already are a mess."" Sutter: The county where no one's gay . But how do we make men without a college education less of a mess? This is the master problem of American society, and not only American society. Everywhere in the developed world, the decline of mass-production industries has put pressure on the roles and incomes of working-class and middle-class men. The expansion of government and service industries has opened new opportunities for women, of which working-class and middle-class men seem less able to avail themselves. It's important to note that men in full-time work continue to earn more than women in full-time work. But that bottom-line number conceals a widening divergence between the family patterns of the college-educated top one-third, where family life is increasingly stable, and those of the non-college-educated bottom two-thirds, where family life is increasingly disrupted. It's the family life of the bottom two-thirds that is the family policy challenge of the 21st century. The debate over same-sex marriage is yesteryear's issue. It's settled, whether the Supreme Court knows it or not. But how to ensure that the next generation of American children enjoys the more equal chance and the wider opportunities from a more universal commitment to marriage -- that debate needs to begin.

"(CNN) -- Historic flooding forced the U.S. Coast Guard to shut down commercial traffic on part of the Mississippi River Friday as authorities downstream raced to build and reinforce levees, polish evacuation plans and warn residents to start thinking about getting out. ""When you see the Mississippi River and it's about two miles wide because it's lost its borders, it's sobering,"" said Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. The Coast Guard closed a five-mile stretch of the river at Caruthersville, Missouri, on Friday to prevent waves generated by passing barges from damaging levees and flood gates along the river, Chief Warrant Officer Lionel Bryant said. The closure could last as long as eight days, Bryant said. See images of flooding across the Midwest and South and share your story. While other stretches of the river remain open, the closure will block barges loaded with commodities headed for Gulf of Mexico ports. It could have ramifications across the country, Memphis, Tennessee, Mayor A.C. Wharton said. ""When you close the Mississippi River, it affects the economy nationwide,"" the mayor of the historic river town said. Authorities in the Memphis area fanned out to low-lying neighborhoods Friday to warn residents of 1,089 homes that they are at risk from the coming floodwaters and to urge them to leave, according to city and county officials. ""We're trying to prevent as many rescue missions as we can and manage this through evacuation missions,"" said Bob Nations, director of the county's Office of Preparedness. Memphis Police knocked on Pamela Holliday's front door Friday morning. ""The police were telling us if the floodwaters get any higher they will turn off electricity and we will have to move,"" she told CNN affiliate WMC. The Mississippi River is expected to crest about 14 feet above flood stage at Memphis on Wednesday. Nations said authorities are planning as if the river will exceed that forecast. ""This is an act of nature, and nature plays funny tricks sometimes,"" he said. Wharton said city officials have not ordered anyone to evacuate, but are prepared to do so should the need arise. In Cotton Plant, Arkansas, which was under a mandatory evacuation order that also affected the towns of Gregory and McClelland, some residents were staying put. Waters topped at least one levee in the area, prompting the evacuation order. The order affected about 1,000 residents in the three small towns. ""I saw a lot of people leaving and I just laughed,"" Cotton Plant resident Cleodis Smith told CNN affiliate KATV. ""I just said they're going to be coming right back because the water's not getting here."" Floods prompted authorities to close 22 miles of Interstate 40 between Hazen and Brinkley in eastern Arkansas early Thursday. The eastbound stretch of the interstate was also closed Thursday night, state transportation officials said, and both remained closed Friday. The Mississippi Department of Transportation advised motorists that the Interstate 40 situation in Arkansas will bring increased traffic on U.S 82. between Interstate 55 and the Greenville Bridge. The flooding in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys has already chased people from their homes in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas. Now it has Mississippi and Louisiana under the gun. In Mississippi, flooding was impacting casinos in Tunica, threatening an anticipated $87 million hit to the local economy for the month of May, CNN affiliate WREG reported. Farmers face losing their crops, said Andy Prosser, a spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. ""Once water goes over the top of corn, it's gone,"" he said. In Louisiana, the state Department of Corrections began preparing to evacuate inmates from Angola State Prison, suspended some construction work and put more National Guard troops on the job as the flood drew closer. In Vidalia, Louisiana, authorities had completed the evacuation of a hospital there and were working feverishly to build fortifications around water supplies and other infrastructure, Gov. Bobby Jindal said. He said forecasters have told him parts of the state could be dealing with high water levels until July. ""You'll have a crest that could last seven to 10 days but you could have elevated water levels last for weeks after that,"" he said. The Army Corps of Engineers said that it would open a spillway 28 miles upstream from New Orleans to reduce the volume and velocity of the Mississippi River as the record level of water races south to the sea. The spillway can accommodate about 1.87 million gallons of water per second, diverting it to the Gulf of Mexico by way of Lake Pontchartrain and sparing the low-lying city of New Orleans from high waters. The spillway is scheduled to open Monday, the Corps said. A second spillway may open later in the week, Jindal said. If the Morganza Spillway is opened, Morgan City, Louisiana, could face record flooding, said Ken Graham of the National Weather Service. The record flood there is 10.53 feet set in 1973 -- the last time the spillway was opened. Graham said his modeling shows as much as 12 feet of water inundating the area this time around. Jindal said he had requested that President Barack Obama make a disaster declaration for the state because of ""predicted and imminent record flooding."" Earlier this week, the Corps of Engineers intentionally breached a levee south of where the Ohio River joins the Mississippi River to help alleviate water pressure on levees throughout the region. The Corps said the breach would help lower river levels and prevent widespread flooding in communities such as Cairo, Illinois, which sits at the confluence of the two rivers. That city remained under a mandatory evacuation order Friday. Six other southern Illinois communities were under voluntary evacuation recommendations. ""We don't want to get into a situation where people go back to their homes, and then we have to make emergency rescues if something changes,"" said Patti Thompson, spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.","Tennessee governor says sight of the Mississippi two miles wide is ""sobering""

"(CNN) -- The National Rifle Association's Friday press event has received almost uniformly negative reviews. Yet the speech by NRA chief Wayne LaPierre had this merit: It pulled into daylight for all to see the foundational assumption of modern American gun culture. LaPierre argued that our society is stalked by unknown numbers of monsters, potential mass murders like Adam Lanza. Then he said this: Even if we could somehow identify future Adam Lanzas, ""that wouldn't even begin to address the much larger and more lethal criminal class: Killers, robbers, rapists and drug gang members who have spread like cancer in every community in this country."" The ""criminal class"" sentence is key. In LaPierre's mind, the world is divided between law-abiding citizens and dangerous criminals. Citizens and criminals form two separate and discrete categories. The criminals pose a threat; if the citizens do not go armed against the threat, they will be victimized by the threat. I know people who carry handguns with them wherever they go, and for just the reason described by LaPierre. Now let's take a look at the real world of American gun ownership. The following incident occurred in August: . ""A man was shot in the face 9 p.m. Friday in an altercation with a neighbor over barking dogs on Atlas Street,"" Troy Police said. ""Police arrested David George Keats, 73, of Troy [Michigan] and charged him with attempted murder in the incident,"" according to a media release from the Troy Police Department. ""According to police, witnesses stated that the altercation began when Keats let his three dogs outside and the dogs began to bark. According to the media release, Keats' 52-year-old next door neighbor yelled at the dogs to be quiet and kicked the fence. Keats then ran up to the victim, yelled, 'Don't tell my dogs to shut up,' and began shooting at the victim. ""One bullet hit the man in the face, piercing both cheeks, and four more shots were fired at the victim as he was running away,"" according to the report. The encounter between Keats and his neighbor ended nonlethally only by good luck. A shot in the face is a shot to kill. The great divide on guns . Nor was this encounter aberrational. There's solid research to show that most so-called defensive gun uses are not really defensive at all. In the late 1990s, teams of researchers at the Harvard school of public health interviewed dozens of people who had wielded a gun for self-defense. (In many cases, the guns were not fired, but were simply brandished.) The researchers pressed for the fullest description of exactly what happened. They then presented the descriptions to five criminal court judges from three states. ""The judges were told to assume that the respondent had a permit to own and carry the gun and had described the event honestly from his/her own perspective. The judges were then asked to give their best guess whether, based on the respondent's description of the incident, the respondent's use of the gun was very likely legal, likely legal, as likely as not legal, unlikely legal, or very unlikely legal."" Even on those two highly favorable (and not very realistic) assumptions, the judges rated the majority of the self-defensive gun uses as falling into one of the two illegal categories. The researchers concluded: . ""Guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self-defense. Most self-reported self-defense gun uses may well be illegal and against the interests of society."" That certainly describes the Keats shooting. With a little Google searching, you can pull up dozens of similar incidents. Kurtz: Will media stay focused on gun story? Here's a story from just this past week, December 22. ""Longview, Washington -- A man shot and killed his uncle during an argument at their apartment complex late Friday night. ...'We heard a big bang,' said Ron Nelson, who lives a few apartments down...Nelson said the men were fighting over a hat and a cell phone."" Now that so many Americans carry weapons when they go out of the home, shooting incidents can occur anywhere, including very commonly the road. Another recent incident: In Pensacola, Florida, in October a man in a Jeep Cherokee cut off another car. A roadway confrontation followed, the two cars stopped, and the Jeep owner emerged to shoot the other driver in the knee. He was arrested this past week. In these cases, and thousands like them each and every year, it is not so clear who is the ""good guy"" exercising responsible self-protection and who is the ""bad guy"" who can only be deterred by an armed citizen. But the guns in their hands protected exactly nobody. They turned ordinary altercations into murderous exchanges of fire. They brought wounds, death and criminal prosecution where otherwise there would likely only have been angry words or at worst, black eyes. LaPierre's offers a vision of American society as one unending replay of the worst scenes in Charles Bronson's 1974 vigilante classic, ""Death Wish."" The people most victimized by this nightmare vision end up being the people who believe it -- and who carry the weapons that kill or maim their neighbors, their relatives, their spouses, and random passersby. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: NRA statement surfaced the key rationale for its views on guns .

"(CNN) -- Red wine in moderation has been shown to reduce the risks of heart disease. Enjoy a glass with dinner tonight. Those words accord with the best available medical knowledge. When I write them here, I am protected by the First Amendment. If, however, a winemaker were to include those words on a wine label, that winemaker would find itself in serious legal trouble. Fortunately, most of us have a pretty good idea of the health risks and benefits of wine. But when it comes to other important health-affecting products, we depend on doctors, and they, in turn, depend on medical researchers. The free flow of information among medical researchers is regulated very nearly as tightly as advertising by winemakers but by a different government agency: the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA tells pharmaceutical companies what they may say about their products. Any use of the drugs must be approved by the FDA before companies can recommend that use. They are forbidden to mention anything beyond that. Up until last week anyway. Last week, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals decided a case (PDF) that could that could dramatically expand the free-speech rights of pharmaceutical companies, allowing them to share unapproved information about the drugs they make. The case involved a salesman who talked too much. Alfred Caronia worked as a sales representative for Orphan Medical Inc., now called Jazz Pharmaceuticals, the company that makes Xyrem, a drug approved to treat a severe version of the sleep disorder narcolepsy. This is a rare condition, and the market for Xyrem was small, about $20 million a year in 2005. Caronia's job was to promote the use of Xyrem to physicians. He seems not to have been very successful at it. In 2005, the federal government began an investigation into Caronia for illegally promoting the drug for uses unapproved by the Federal Drug Administration. He was recorded saying that Xyrem could be used on patients under age 16, unapproved by the FDA. Caronia also suggested that Xyrem could be used to treat fibromyalgia, ditto unapproved. He finally suggested that the drug could be used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness, a use unapproved at the time but approved later. Caronia and an associate were sentenced to a year's probation. All Caronia did was to speak. One of his claims was corroborated later by the FDA itself. The FDA made no contention that any of his other claims were false or misleading. He was punished not for speaking fraudulently but for speaking without permission. Other people are allowed to speak about off-label use of drugs. If you take aspirin for your heart, but have not had a previous heart attack, you are engaged in an off-label use of drugs right now: FDA-approved labels only mention aspirin as a remedy against recurrent heart trouble. Yet many doctors recommend aspirin as a prophylactic for everyone at risk of heart disease. Doctors freely debate this issue. So do many laypeople. The only people forbidden to join the discussion are the companies who actually make aspirin. Caronia's words became a crime only because he happened to be an employee of the company that made Xyrem. How, Caronia and his employer asked, can that be constitutional? On December 3, a 2-to-1 majority of the Second Circuit agreed with Caronia and Jazz: It's not. The court said, ""the government cannot prosecute pharmaceutical manufacturers and their representatives ... for speech promoting the lawful, off-label use of an FDA-approved drug."" This is big, big news for the drug industry. The ban on discussion of ""off-label"" uses of medicine is based on a binary vision of how medicines operate. In this vision, any potential use of a drug is either ""safe and effective"" or not ""safe and effective."" Until the FDA says yes, the answer must be no. The trouble is, that vision does not describe the real world very well. Rather than fit into clearly defined categories of ""effective"" or ""not effective,"" the value of drugs often blurs across a spectrum. A friend who thinks profoundly about these issues calls pharmaceuticals ""useful poisons."" They always come with harms attached. The harms and benefits are always uncertain. For example, FDA-approved advertising will recommend aspirin only for those who have had one heart attack already, but many doctors recommend aspirin prophylactically for people at risk for a first attack. The FDA applies bright line rules, backed by criminal penalties, to an area of science where the lines are not bright at all. There's no mystery to the evil FDA seeks to prevent. It's well-described by the dissent in the Caronia case. ""Hardware stores are generally free to sell bottles of turpentine, but may not label those bottles, 'Hamlin's Wizard Oil: There is no Sore it will Not Heal; No Pain it will not Subdue,' "" the judge wrote. Hamlin's Wizard Oil was one of the very first products shut down by the Food and Drug Act in the early 20th century. But in trying to protect the public from flim-flam, the FDA also risks depriving doctors of early notice of information that could treat and cure their patients. The irony is that the law allows ""all-natural food supplements"" to make all kinds of wild promises: They're subject to a different and much more permissive regulatory scheme. You'll hear radio ads for ""supplements"" that tout these products as ""so effective, clinical trials have already begun."" Yet for pharmaceutical products, even the news that a clinical trial has been completed was, until this week, forbidden speech unless the FDA gave the word. That rule has abruptly changed. You're going to hear more talk about what scientists think medicines might be able to do. Where the side effects of a medicine are high, and where good alternatives are available, doctors and patients will want to exercise caution until the final experiments conclude. But where alternatives do not exist, where something is better than nothing, the Caronia ruling offers hope for a more transparent drug-approval regime. Nothing is certain until the Supreme Court weighs in. But it's looking likelier that freer speech is coming to American medicine. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Court ruling may dramatically open drug companies' free speech rights .

"(CNN) -- The world of punditry is divided into two groups: those who attend the World Economic Forum at Davos and those who mock the World Economic Forum at Davos. (There's a subgroup that both attends and mocks, but it's tiny.) Yet Davos is important, whether you attend or no. (I don't.) And if Ian Bremmer is right, this year something genuinely encouraging may be happening at the grand global gathering of business leaders, politicians and big-thinking academics. ""As the world struggles to bolster its resilience against economic and political uncertainty, the key risk is the increasing vulnerability of elites. We're seeing leaders of all kinds, in the developed and developing world, in politics as well as business and media, answering to constituents who grow more dissatisfied... and information-rich. Look at the riots in India over the recent rape scandal, the U.S. Congress' abysmal approval ratings or the phone hacking scandal at News Corp. Corruption, special interests or a lack of transparency will spell trouble for leaders."" Bremmer, a brilliant analyst of the global economy, is a regular Davos participant. He's recording his impressions of the 2013 conference in a diary for the Huffington Post. If he's perceiving elite anxiety, one can only say: finally. ""What all the wise men promised has not happened, and what all the damned fools said would happen has come to pass."" So snarked Queen Victoria's first prime minister, Lord Melbourne. He might have been talking about the euro. Or the securitization of the U.S. mortgage market. Or the British government's attempt to restore prosperity through budget austerity. Or. Or. Or. Over the past decade and a half, we've seen one horrendous economic decision after another made, not by voters in democracies, but by people who owed their power to their claims of superior knowledge. Together, they have plunged us into a decade and a half of disasters, culminating in a global financial crisis triggered by new credit instruments that were advertised as ending financial crises once and for all. Cameron at Davos: Focus on trade, taxes, transparency . Yet by and large, these leaders have escaped public accountability or even criticism over the past six years of global crisis. The people who designed the euro continue to run the European Central Bank. The people who wrecked the American banking system walked away with multimillion-dollar severance packages. We all know that life's not fair. But this unfair? So it's welcome news that the Davos attenders are suddenly feeling ""vulnerable."" They ought to. Elected leaders can at least be removed by the voters. Not so central bankers, financial regulators, and investment bankers, even though they can (and often do) exercise more power than any elected official. Global CEOs lack confidence in 2013 . Bremmer appears to suggest that the correct response to elite vulnerability is more transparency. I don't think that's quite right. If banks and regulators were delivering good results, nobody would mind their opaqueness. It's the bad results that drive the demand for transparency. But that's not because we really want more transparency. What we really want is more competence and more success and success that benefits the many, rather than lavishly over-rewarding a privileged few even as they ruin everything and everyone around them. According to Bremmer, the theme of this year's Davos conference is ""Resilient Dynamism."" It would have done better if it had adopted instead the theme, ""We Messed Up."" That would open the way to panels on ""Why We Messed Up"" and ""How Not to Do it Again."" More cynical attendees might opt for practical discussions on topics like, ""How to Sound Contrite Even Though You're Not a Bit Sorry."" It's probably too much to expect the Davos gathering to feel any real remorse. But if they at least feel fear, that's a promising start on the way to reform.","David Frum says reports are the elites attending Davos feel vulnerable .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats seem poised to choose their next presidential nominee the way Republicans often choose theirs: according to the principle of ""next in line."" Hillary Clinton came second in the nomination fight of 2008. If she were a Republican, that would make her a near-certainty to be nominated in 2016. Five of the past six Republican nominees had finished second in the previous round of primaries. (The sixth was George W. Bush, son of the most recent Republican president.) Democrats, by contrast, prefer newcomers. Six of their eight nominees since 1972 had never sought national office before. Obviously, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Democrats chose the next guy in line in 2000 -- Vice President Al Gore -- and they may well do so again. But speaking from across the aisle, it's just this one observer's opinion that Democrats would be poorly served by following the Republican example when President Obama's term ends. Hillary Clinton is 14 years older than Barack Obama. A party has never nominated a leader that much older than his immediate predecessor. (The previous record-holder was James Buchanan, 13 years older than Franklin Pierce when the Democrats chose him in 1856. Runner-up: Dwight Eisenhower, 12 years older than his predecessor, Thomas Dewey.) Parties have good reasons to avoid reaching back to politicians of prior generations. When they do, they bring forward not only the ideas of the past, but also the personalities and the quarrels of the past. One particular quarrel that a Hillary Clinton nomination would bring forward is the quarrel over the ethical standards of the Clinton White House -- and, maybe even more, of the Clintons' post-White House careers. Relying on Hillary Clinton's annual financial disclosure reports, CNN reported last year that former President Bill Clinton had earned $89 million in speaking fees since leaving the White House in 2001. Many of these earnings came from foreign sources. In 2011 alone, the former president earned $6.1 million from 16 speeches in 11 foreign countries. Is it an ethical problem for the husband of the person charged with the foreign affairs of the United States to earn so much foreign-sourced income? Let's rephrase that question: How much time do Democrats wish to spend arguing the ethics of Bill Clinton's foreign earnings over the 2016 political cycle? Yet the biggest risk to Democrats from a Hillary Clinton nomination is not that it would be generationally backward-looking -- or that it would reopen embarrassing ethical disputes -- but that it would short-circuit the necessary work of party renewal. After eight years in the White House, a party requires a self-appraisal and a debate over its way forward. Bill Clinton offered Democrats just such a debate in 1992 with his ""New Democrat"" ideas. Barack Obama offered another in 2008 with his careful but unmistakable criticism of Clinton-era domestic policies and Hillary Clinton's Iraq war vote. But if Hillary Clinton glides into the nomination in 2016 on the strength of money, name recognition, and a generalized feeling of ""It's her turn,"" then Democrats will forgo this necessary renewal. Here's what could happen instead in 2016: . One candidate could seek the Democratic nomination on a platform of keeping faith with the ideals of the pre-presidential Obama: closing Guantanamo, ending targeted killings, and so on. Another Democrat could run to represent those Democrats who supported Bill Clinton back in the 1990s, and who worry that the Obama administration has drifted too far to the left: spending too much, ignoring budget deficits, getting into too many fights with business. Yet another could run as a full-throated defender of the Obama legacy, updating the 1988 George H.W. Bush ""stay the course"" message. This would be a real debate that would summon forth hard thinking about how Democrats might govern their country if returned for a third presidential term (as could very well happen, given the continuing political weakness of the GOP). A Hillary Clinton campaign would want to shut down any such debate before it starts. It would want to inherit the Democratic nomination and then the presidency as an estate in reversion: a debt long owed, now collected. If successful, it would arrive in office without a platform and without much of a mandate. That's not a formula for an effective presidency -- or a healthy democracy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Democrats seem poised to let Hillary Clinton inherit nomination in 2016, writes David Frum .

"(CNN) -- Here's the next thing the Republican party needs to rethink. What does it say if and when the United States returns to prosperity? For five years, U.S. politics have been shaped by economic hardship. In 2008 and 2010, voters rejected the party in power, booting Republicans out of the White House, and then sweeping Democrats out of Congress. Mitt Romney campaigned in 2012 on the slogan, ""Obama isn't working."" President Obama responded by attacking Romney as out of touch, assuming (probably correctly) that he could not win by running on his record. But the indicators are suggesting that by 2013 and 2014, the Obama record will begin to look a lot better, assuming, that is, that the two parties in Washington don't recklessly push the country off the fiscal cliff at the end of the year. Opinion: How Republicans can bounce back . The nation's economy added 171,000 jobs in October 2012, for a total of almost 700,000 in the four months before Election Day. More than half the jobs lost in the crash of 2008-2009 have now been recovered, even as public-sector employment has shrunk by a net 500,000. The economy is recovering because consumers are less burdened by debt. They are paying down their credit cards, building home equity and strengthening their personal balance sheets. As household debt burdens become lighter, consumers express more confidence. They are allowing themselves to spend a little more. They are even buying new homes again. Housing starts in October 2012 rose to a level 41.9% over a year before. Accelerating economic activity is rapidly reducing the budget deficit. The deficit has contracted since 2009 at the fastest rate since the end of World War II, faster even than during the late 1990s boom. Wages remain flat, and will likely stay flat until unemployment contracts more, but Americans can begin to see better times ahead for the first time in a long time. News: GOP resistance to anti-tax pledge grows . As they do glimpse that better future, two things will happen in politics: . 1) President Obama will begin to claim more credit. In 2012, the word ""stimulus"" went unmentioned by Democrats. It was Republicans who tried to make political use of the $800 billion spent on job creation in 2009-2011. In 2013-2014, however, the shoe may suddenly rematerialize on the other foot. 2) Republicans will discover that their old ""Obama isn't working"" theme has become obsolete. By 2014, again assuming that Congress does not leap off the fiscal cliff, it will likely look as if Obama is working. What then? If negative messaging failed in 2012, it will fail bigger in 2014. For too long, the Republicans have predicted apocalypse, debt crisis, the loss of freedom, the overthrow of the constitution. As the economy improves, that doom-saying will seem even more out of touch than ever. Republican political chances will depend on the Republican ability to devise a positive program to address the country's fiscal problems in ways that improve people's lives. It's a new day, guys, and it demands a new game.

"(CNN) -- Global emissions of carbon dioxide hit a record high in 2011, scientists from the Global Carbon Project reported last week. Another record is expected in 2012. The earth continues to warm, and to warm fast, with serious consequences for human life and welfare. 2012 saw the worst drought in the United States in half a century. Russia suffered its second bad drought in three years. Climatic shocks to these two countries are raising food prices worldwide, posing an especially acute threat to the world's poorest. Major storm events strike harder and more often, because warming oceans create conditions for fiercer hurricanes. The New York Times reported Friday: . ""Emissions continue to grow so rapidly that an international goal of limiting the ultimate warming of the planet to 3.6 degrees, established three years ago, is on the verge of becoming unattainable."" This ominous news arrives as delegates gather in Doha, Qatar, for the latest annual round of climate talks sponsored by the United Nations. Few expect the Doha talks to produce much decision. Yet there is good news on the environmental front, important news. Carbon emissions in the United States have declined since 2009 -- not emissions per person (those have been declining for decades), but emissions in absolute terms. The weak economy explains part of the decline, but the real hero of the story is the natural gas fracking revolution. A decade ago, half of all the electricity generated in the United States was generated by burning coal, the most carbon-dense fuel of them all. Today, coal's share of the electricity mix has plunged to one-third, as utilities substitute cheap natural gas. Gas production has become much cheaper with the growth of fracking -- forcing open rocks by injecting fluid into cracks. Gas emits about half as much carbon per unit of energy as coal. Environmentalists have responded warily to the advent of gas. They prefer zero-emissions power sources like wind and solar -- sources made more uncompetitive than ever by ultracheap natural gas. (Today's price: about $3.50 per thousand cubic feet, down about 70% from the prices of the mid-2000s.) Moreover, natural gas does little (as yet) to address emissions from automobile tailpipes. But maybe there's a way to cheer environmentalists up. Take three worrying long-term challenges: climate change, the weak economic recovery, and America's chronic budget deficits. Combine them into one. And suddenly three tough problems become one attractive solution. Tax carbon. A tax of $20 a ton, rising at a rate of 4% per year, would over the next decade raise $1.5 trillion, according to an important new study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That $1.5 trillion is almost twice as much as would be recouped to the Treasury by allowing the expiration of all Bush-era tax cuts for upper-income taxpayers. The revenues from a carbon tax could be used to reduce the deficit while also extending new forms of payroll tax relief to middle-class families, thus supporting middle-class family incomes. Meanwhile, the shock of slowly but steadily rising prices for fuel and electricity would drive economic changes that would accelerate U.S. economic growth. The average age of U.S. cars and trucks has reached nearly 11 years, a record. Millions of Americans want new cars. They are waiting for market signals as to what car to buy. They want to know that if they choose a fuel-efficient vehicle, they won't feel silly three years from now when their neighbor roars past them in a monster truck because gas has plunged back to $2 a gallon. After five years of depression, the housing market is also ready for renewal. Again, Americans are waiting for market signals: Should they buy smaller houses nearer to work? High and rising fuel prices will encourage developers to build more mixed-use complexes that allow more people to live car-free: walking to work, entertainment, and shopping. The surest way to reduce fuel costs is to drive less. The return to more urban living is a trend big enough to sustain America's next great economic boom. To the extent researchers can measure, the daily commute appears to be the single worst recurring source of unhappiness in American life. If changes in city shape can offer more Americans the opportunity to walk to work through an attractive shopping mall, rather than waste 50 minutes in a car in a traffic jam, those changes will advance human happiness, spur new construction work, and incidentally save the planet. A carbon tax will also enable the United States and Europe to press China and India to reduce their carbon emissions. A properly designed tax would apply not only to domestic goods and services, but to imports as well. China and India would discover that their products no longer seem so cheap when a carbon tax at the border adds back the environmental costs of dirty manufacturing. To export to the world's richest consumers, China and India will have to clean up their act -- an incentive more persuasive than a hundred Doha conferences. More jobs and growth; reduced deficits without raising income taxes; lower taxes for middle-class families; a kick in the pants to Chinese polluters; and more happiness for American commuters -- one policy instrument can do it all. What's not to love about a carbon tax? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Carbon dioxide emissions worldwide are at record levels .
To strike a blow against climate change, U.S. should enact a carbon tax, Frum says .

"(CNN) -- Monday will be a day of mourning for the slain schoolchildren of Newtown, Connecticut. Then what? Some are urging President Barack Obama to lead a national campaign for tighter control of firearms. Bad idea. If the president -- any president -- inserts himself into the gun debate, he will inevitably polarize it. Supporters of the president will rally, but opponents of the president will become more obdurate. Because the president has many items on his agenda, and often needs the votes of Democrats from districts where pro-gun feeling runs strong, his opponents will probably outlast him. Presidential leadership on guns will most likely fail for another reason, one that comes from a darker and grimmer place in American culture. I've written before at CNN about the paradoxes of American gun ownership. Here's one more such paradox: Obama has done literally nothing to restrict the (large and growing) rights of gun owners. President Bill Clinton signed two important pieces of gun control legislation and issued many restrictive executive orders; Obama has not so much as introduced even one. Yet the election of Obama has triggered an angry reaction among gun owners fiercer than anything seen under Clinton. Between 1960 and the late 1990s, there occurred a gradual decline in the percentage of American homes that contain a gun, from about one-half to about one-third. (This trend is at least partly explained by the decline of hunting as a sport. In 2011, about 6% of Americans aged 16 or over went hunting even once in the year. ) In 2009, however, that trend away from guns abruptly went into reverse. Gun buying spiked in the Obama administration, pushing the share of households with a gun all the way back up to 47%, near the 1960 peak, even as crime rates tumbled to the lowest levels ever recorded, making guns less necessary than ever to self-defense. Black Friday 2012 set a one-day record for gun sales. What's going on? People who buy guns for self-defense do not look only to the statistics for information about the dangers they face. They are guided by their own perceptions, and often their own misperceptions. By the numbers, Obama's America is probably the safest America ever. But in the imaginations of millions of people, Obama's America is threatened by social instability. For many, the president himself is the leading symbol of the changes they fear. The more the president leads the campaign for gun control, the more hopeless that campaign will be. Instead, progress to more rational gun laws must be led from outside the political system. Look at the success of the campaign against drunken driving. In 1980, 13-year-old Cari Lightner was struck and killed by a drunken driver. That driver had recently been arrested for another driving under the influence offense, but he remained on the road to kill again. Cari's mother, Candice, threw herself into the cause of stopping drunken driving. A powerful organizer, she founded a group, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, that not only changed laws at the federal and state level, but also changed the larger cultural context. Forty years ago, the hugely popular entertainer, Dean Martin, made giggling jokes about being drunk at the wheel. Today, in millions of American homes, workplaces and restaurants, ""friends don't let friends drive drunk"" has replaced ""one for the road."" This is the model for the future campaign against dangerous weapons. That campaign should be led from outside the political system, by people who have suffered loss and grief from gun violence. Only that way can the campaign avoid being held hostage by the usual conflict of parties -- Democrats who fear that gun control will lose them rural congressional districts; Republicans who exaggerate for partisan gain exactly what gun control would mean. Gun control should no more mean the abolition of guns than Mothers Against Drunk Driving abolished the car. Guns are part of the cherished American culture of the outdoors. In many parts of the country, a deer rifle literally puts meat on the table. In other parts, a revolver in the bedroom dresser drawer is the frightened spouse's last defense against an abusive partner, or the gay urban homesteader's final protection against violent bigots. Guns can be souvenirs of heroic moments on faraway battlefields, mementoes of national history, or art objects of great beauty. It's harder to imagine why any civilian would need a semiautomatic weapon. Still, it's a free country, and gun ownership is one of the freedoms specifically cited in the Constitution. Responsible gun owners have a right to their guns. The challenge for the grass-roots gun-safety movement of the future is to focus on the danger posed by irresponsible owners. The goal should be less to ban particular classes of weapons -- such a goal puts the law in a race against technology, a race the law will likely lose -- and more to change the rules defining who may keep a gun. Prospective gun owners should be required to take serious training and pass a safety exam before qualifying for a license. They should be screened for mental illness and histories of violence, very much including domestic violence. They should be required to buy insurance against the harm done by wrongful use of their weapons, and if that insurance proves expensive -- well, too bad. People apprehended in possession of an unlicensed weapon should face severe sanctions. At the same time, we also need to pay attention to the role of mental health professionals in averting such horrors like the Newtown massacre. In a survey of mass killings published in 2000, The New York Times observed: ""They give lots of warning and even tell people explicitly what they plan to do."" Yet it's exceeding difficult in this country to compel treatment of the mentally ill, even as they prepare to commit the worst crimes. The Associated Press reported this disturbing story on October 1: . ""Andrew Engeldinger's parents pushed him for two years to seek treatment for what they suspected was mental illness, but even though he became increasingly paranoid and experienced delusions, there was nothing more they could do. ""Minnesota law doesn't allow people to be forced into treatment without proof that they are a threat to themselves or others. Engeldinger's parents were horrified last week, when their 36-year-old son went on a workplace shooting spree that led to the deaths of a Minneapolis sign company's owner, several of his employees and a UPS driver. Engeldinger then killed himself."" It's important to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of people like Engeldinger. It's also important to expedite the process by which family and friends can require them to accept treatment. Such measures might not produce immediate results, but like the campaign against drunken driving, would steadily enhance gun safety and raise higher the obstacles to the obtaining of weapons by people likely to misuse them. As with any public safety measure, the goal is not absolute security. We'll never reduce the toll of crime, accident and general human mayhem to zero. But after the seventh mass killings of this single year 2012, isn't it about time that we tried to reduce the toll at least somewhat? The politicians can't or won't. But one of the many, many families bereaved in this year of random violence -- maybe they will be moved to follow for the victims of gun crime the lead Candice Lightner established for the victims of reckless driving? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: What happens after the mourning is over?
He says a presidential-led effort on gun safety will likely fail for political reasons .
It would be better if campaign were modeled on MADD, with victims' families leading, he says ."
"(CNN) -- Crisis begets innovation. In the Great Depression, Americans and Britons developed important new technologies: television, movie sound, refrigeration, automatic transmissions for cars. The supermarket was born, as were the passenger aviation industry and the first franchised food company: Dairy Queen. Big industrial companies such as General Motors and U.S. Steel consolidated their dominance at the expense of weaker rivals. States and the federal government planned and opened the first freeways. Millions of Americans moved off the farms of the South and West to populate California and Florida. In a decade of economic deprivation, in other words, we can begin to see the shape of postwar America: the suburbanized, mass-production economy into which the baby boomers would be born. Can we see any similar promise of progress today? I think we can. I discern three glimmers of light on the horizon: . 1. A transition has begun from coal to natural gas as America's most important source of electric power. Natural gas emits about half as much carbon dioxide per unit of energy as coal. That's not as clean as solar or wind, but those technologies cannot (yet) compete on price. Fracking offers hope that natural gas will soon cost least of all. If that hope comes true, the transition from coal to gas will generate a huge burst of economic activity and accelerate the transition to a more sustainable future for humanity. 2. Americans are on the move again, this time from exurb and suburb to downtown, not only where you might expect it -- San Francisco -- but also where you wouldn't: Cleveland's most central census tracts added 20% to their population from 2000 to 2010. Newark, New Jersey, added population for the first time since 1950. Ten thousand people moved to downtown Philadelphia; 15,000 to Los Angeles' once ghostly downtown; 2,000 to downtown Detroit. Downtown Baltimore is up 11% since 2006. The Loop in Chicago is up 76% in the past decade. Central Louisville is being rebuilt. The shift to a greener economy involves changes in the way we use space as much or more as changes in the way we use fuel: People reorganizing their lives in ways that allow them to walk to work rather than drive. The downtown revival remains a boutique industry. Real densification will come as Americans add condo towers beside their suburban office parks and atop shopping malls; as four-story and six-story multi-use buildings rise along the boulevards of Los Angeles; and as entrepreneurs invent 21st-century mass transit systems to interconnect them, such as Wi-Fi equipped jitney buses that arrive within 10 minutes of a tap on a smart phone. Building new cities will put construction workers back on the job. Living in them will liberate millions of person-hours from the waste of the commute. 3. Over the past 20 years since the advent of Prozac, clinicians and researchers have developed a vastly enhanced understanding of depression. We as yet live in the infancy of mental health science, but the path forward from infancy is at last revealing itself. Depression is not only a source of terrible personal suffering but also a huge economic burden on society. It debilitates otherwise healthy people and may well prove the ultimate cause of drug and alcohol addiction, obesity and many industrial and auto accidents. Deep into the 1930s, people regularly died from ordinary infections that today would barely cost them a day off work or school. (In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge lost his 16-year-old son to an infected blister, caused by playing tennis without socks on his feet.) Half a century from now, will people look back as pityingly on our bafflement before nearly equally devastating but ultimately treatable mental illnesses? What will they say of our practice of leaving the most severely mentally ill to walk uncared-for through the streets of our cities, sleeping on the streets and dying of cold and exposure? In 1940, health care remained a boutique industry, accounting for roughly 4% of gross national product. In the decades since, health care has grown into one of America's most gigantic enterprises, 17% of GDP -- arguably too much but still a huge driver of employment and investment. Yet within this vast economic complex, mental health remains a stunted subdomain. Research into diseases of the mind, the production of medicines, the training and employment of treatment personnel -- might these not emerge as giant industries of tomorrow? It would be a very positive irony if this decade of economic depression should prove the era in which science at last broke the clammy grip of psychic depression. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","In the midst of today's economic troubles, David Frum sees reasons for hope .
He says America's energy picture is changing fast with new surplus of natural gas .

"(CNN) -- Last month, two political scientists published one of those rare op-eds that gets the political community talking. The thesis of the piece was contained in the title: ""Let's just say it: The Republicans are the problem."" In case that was not clear enough, the authors elaborated: ""We have been studying Washington politics and Congress for more than 40 years, and never have we seen them this dysfunctional. ""In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted. Today, however, we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the Republican Party. ""The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition. ""When one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the country's challenges."" The piece drew its authority from the authors' identity: Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein, two of Washington's most veteran watchers of Congress. Both men have hard-earned reputations for nonideological independence of mind despite their institutional affiliations: Mann works at the liberal Brookings Institution, Ornstein at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. (Ornstein is a friend of mine, and was a colleague until I was given the heave-ho from AEI in March 2010.) Now they have backed their provocative op-ed with a new book, ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism."" The book backs the arresting op-ed with a battery of depressing research, substantiating their charge that congressional Republicans now act in a uniquely irresponsible way. The debt showdown last summer was the ultimate case: congressional Republicans nearly forcing a default on the obligations of the United States to get their way on a budget agreement. But the pattern manifests itself in almost all the business of government, down to the most mundane. For example: Because Senate rules often require unanimous consent to move to the next order of business, a determined minority can force delay on almost any action it opposes. Since 2009, Republicans have used this power of delay hyper-aggressively. Compare and contrast the treatment of executive-branch nominees. Sixteen months into the George W. Bush administration, Memorial Day 2002, only 13 executive-branch nominations awaited confirmation by the Senate. At the corresponding moment in the Obama administration, Memorial Day 2010, 108 nominees were awaiting action by the Senate. This comparison is supported by another academic study. The confirmation process got gradually slower between the 1960s and the 1990s. Then, suddenly, in the second Clinton administration, the confirmation process seized up. Under the elder Bush, a Republican president facing a Democratic Senate, 92% of nominees were confirmed within an average of 57 days. In the second Clinton administration, facing a Republican Senate, only 74% of nominees were confirmed, taking an average of 110 days. Ornstein and Mann offer a convincing array of explanations for the trend toward radicalism within the GOP, including changes in campaign finance and in the electorate itself. They offer too a range of proposals to work around GOP radicalism and restore the effective functioning of Congress. If those proposals have a faint wistful air to them, blame the inherent difficulty of the problem, not Mann and Ornstein. But one thing is missing from their powerful and important book, and it's a thought I'd like to enter here into the record: The radicalization of the GOP is a function of changes, not only in U.S. politics, but also in the U.S. economy. Americans are living through an era of disappointment. It's becoming obvious that the U.S. government cannot meet all the expectations that built up in better times. The tax status quo, the Medicare status quo, the social safety net status quo, the defense status quo -- they can't all be sustained. Something must give, and almost everybody senses it. In good times, we debate whether government should expand programs or cut taxes -- new benefits in either case. In these times, we are debating whether government should impose large reductions in programs or impose big increases in taxes -- taking from people benefits that they now enjoy. Human beings will typically fight much more ferociously to keep what they possess than to gain something new. And the constituencies that vote Republican happen to possess the most and thus to be exposed to the worst risks of loss. The Republican voting base includes not only the wealthy with the most to fear from tax increases, but also the elderly and the rural, the two constituencies that benefit the most from federal spending and thus have the most to lose from spending cuts. All those constituencies together fear that almost any conceivable change will be change for the worse from their point of view: higher taxes, less Medicare, or possibly both. Any attempt to do more for other constituencies -- the unemployed, the young -- represents an extra, urgent threat to them. That sense of threat radicalizes voters and donors -- and has built a huge reservoir of votes and money for politicians and activists who speak as radically as the donors and voters feel. Which means the solution to the problems so astutely diagnosed by Mann and Ornstein must ultimately be found outside the American political system -- and will not be solved until America's rich and America's elderly become either less fearful or more generous. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Op-ed from respected political observers says the core problem with government is GOP .

"(CNN) -- For the record, I'm not a leading fan of the economist Jeffrey Sachs. But even from the ""away"" team benches, you have to salute the audacity of his latest adventure. Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, has nominated himself to be president of the World Bank. He has launched a political campaign to win the necessary votes from governments worldwide. He has won the endorsements of eight governments and 27 members of the U.S. Congress. Nobody has ever seen anything like this before. While people do ""campaign"" for jobs as heads of international organizations, they usually do so from behind the scenes. Their names mysteriously begin to be mentioned in the columns of The Financial Times, Foreign Policy magazine and The International Economy, but they never admit on the record that they want the job, much less go on the road giving speeches and interviews asking for it. Until now. ""There have been 11 presidents of the World Bank, and not one of them yet has been an expert in international development,"" Sachs said in an interview with The Washington Post on March 8. ""The world would be better off and America's interests in a peaceful world would be better served by an expert in development at the bank."" Sachs is not even slightly coy about who that expert should be. In the end, the choice of World Bank president comes down to an electorate of one, the president of the United States. The U.S. is the single largest shareholder in the bank, and by tradition the bank's president is always an American. (By the same tradition, the president of the International Monetary Fund is always a European.) The past heads of the bank have usually either been bankers with close administration ties or else serious-minded politicians looking for a second career. Appointment to the bank has also sometimes been used as a dignified way to say goodbye to officials whose services are no longer required. Lyndon Johnson sent Robert McNamara to the bank after Vietnam. George W. Bush sent Paul Wolfowitz after Iraq. This suggests a more obvious nominee for President Barack Obama: Hillary Clinton. The two former rivals from 2008 have worked together impressively until now. President Bill Clinton even stars in Obama's new 17-minute campaign documentary -- an impressive healing of a once-bitter rift. Still, you have to wonder how long Hillary Clinton will want to play deputy to a president with strong foreign policy ideas of his own; and how long Obama will wish to be served by a secretary of state who may be viewing a future after him in 2013 or 2017. This may be the moment for the hearty handshake, and the World Bank may once again offer a convenient and appropriately grand refuge. So you'd want to get good odds before placing a bet on the chances of an untraditional candidate like Sachs. But you also have to wonder: In the era of Facebook and YouTube, of viral media and guerrilla marketing, how long will it remain possible for important international leadership positions to be selected through secret processes? It's not only the head of the World Bank who's chosen by an opaque and elite process. The president of the European Commission exercises more power than most of Europe's 27 elected heads of government. Can you name him? Dominique Strauss-Kahn did his best to raise the profile of the International Monetary Fund. Do you know his successor? The seven board members of the Federal Reserve have far more sway over the U.S. economy than does the president of the United States. In recent years, the Fed chairman has become something of a national figure -- but not the other six. And so it goes. Over the past quarter-century, formal democracy has spread as never before. From Seoul, South Korea, to Bratislava, Slokavia, a higher proportion of the human race lives under elected governments than ever in human history. Yet as national governments yield power to international bureaucracies -- as even the work of domestic government becomes more complex and opaque -- practical democracy seems on the retreat. Sachs' quixotic campaign for World Bank president won't change that reality, even in the unlikely event that he should somehow win. But the campaign can at least draw attention to the reality -- and the gap between how we imagine our societies to be run and how they really are. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Economist Jeffrey Sachs is mounting an unusual public bid to lead World Bank .

"(CNN) -- As Iran rushes ahead with its nuclear program, some foreign policy thinkers urge Israel to accept that it must live with ""incomplete"" security. On Monday morning, 200,000 Israeli children spent the morning in bomb shelters rather than classrooms, as rockets from Gaza barraged southern Israeli cities. That would seem to qualify as security ""incomplete"" enough to satisfy anybody. Israel has met the barrage with a new defense system, named Iron Dome. Iron Dome senses rocket launches. Its computers assess which rockets are headed toward populated areas, then it fires missiles to intercept the incoming rockets. According to the Israel Defense Forces, Iron Dome has achieved a success rate of more than 90% when fired. Since Friday, Palestinian militants have fired more than 170 rockets at Israeli cities, but as yet, no Israeli civilians have been killed. Since 2001, Israel has responded to attacks by deploying ever-more effective technological systems: first the security fence to halt the entry of suicide bombers; now Iron Dome to stop short-range rockets; and in time, the Arrow anti-ballistic missile system against longer-range missiles. These innovations have defeated and deterred violence and saved many lives. But these innovations are also subject to inherent weaknesses. The rockets launched from Gaza are armed only with explosives and shrapnel. When Iron Dome misses -- and it does sometimes miss -- the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius. The fence also fails sometimes. Last year for example, a British citizen was killed and 50 people wounded by a bombing near the Jerusalem convention center. Yet as with the Gaza rockets, the lethality of bombings is inherently limited. Israel does not need to reach 100% success to defeat the terrorism threat. Suppose, however, that the rockets carried nuclear payloads, or that suicide bombers had access to radioactive materials. Then a 90% success rate would not nearly suffice. Iran's nuclear program threatens to upend the strategic calculus of the past decade, to overwhelm all Israeli countermeasures to protect Israel's population. A nuclearized Iran does not imply ""incomplete"" security for Israel. It would expose Israel to absolute insecurity. As rockets fly toward southern Israel, the rest of Israel carries on. The economy produces and thrives. A relative of mine, visiting Jerusalem, comments that if she were not reading about the rockets in the newspapers, she would not know they were being fired. Yet even the threat of a mass-casualty event would paralyze the Israeli economy. People would avoid downtowns, visitors would stay home, children would be sent abroad, investment flows would cease. Iran would not have to shoot at Israel. It would just have to talk loosely about shooting at Israel to do vast harm. Iron Dome represents a triumph of Israeli science, generously supported by U.S. aid under both Presidents Bush and Obama. But we remain far away from a high-tech shield against the Iranian threat. This week's congratulations to Israel must be tempered by awareness: The biggest danger -- Iran's potential ability to build a weapon that could kill hundreds of thousands in a single strike -- looms as menacing as ever.

"Washington (CNN) -- The French will vote next week to elect a new president. The April 22 election pits incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy against challenger Francois Hollande. Sarkozy, a conservative, argues that France did well compared with other European countries in the Great Recession. Hollande, on the left, urges a more expansionary program of government spending to create jobs. Normal politics, in other words. But the vote to watch is not Sarkozy v. Hollande. It is Sarkozy plus Hollande. The French constitution establishes a two-round voting system. The idea is to ensure that the ultimate winner obtains an outright majority of all votes cast. The system's side effect is to invite the French to use their first ballot as a protest vote. Thus in 2007, the nominees of the two big parties won 57% of the vote between them in Round 1, with the remainder scattered among the hard-right National Front and various categories of radical left-wing parties. It is that small party vote that is the vote to watch in 2012. Sarkozy and Hollande disagree on much but not on the euro. Both support the currency, despite the terrible economic toll it has put on the economies of Europe. To sustain the euro, the countries of southern Europe are cutting government expenditures and raising taxes in a futile effort to balance their budgets in the throes of a worsening recession. The euro is doing to Europe in the 2010s what the gold standard did to the United States in the 1930s: magnifying an ordinary downturn into a social catastrophe. Unemployment has risen past 9% in Italy, to 15% in Portugal, 22% in Greece and 23% in Spain. In the past, generous European social networks cushioned unemployed. Those out of work might suffer anxiety and depression, but they need not fear material deprivation. But that's changing as radical budget cuts bite. Portugal, for example, has slashed government spending by the equivalent of 7.5% of GDP over the past two years. How much is 7.5% of GDP? To achieve a similar cut in the United States, we'd have to abolish Social Security and the defense budget. So you can see why the euro project might begin to provoke public discontent. European elites have met that discontent by silencing it. When Greece proposed to hold a referendum on budget cuts, the EU authorities forbade it. When Italy needed aid to remain in the eurozone, the EU authorities forced distrusted Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to resign and installed in his place an economist prime minister without an intervening election. Yet discontent will emerge somewhere. Radical parties are now rising across Europe. In France, polls show more than one-third of the public now supports radical alternatives to the two big traditional parties. About 16% support the far-right National Front and about 17% the neo-communist Left Front (Front de Gauche). The National Front and the neo-communists disagree on issues such as immigration and law enforcement. Yet on economics, the two parties sound increasingly similar. Both want radical change in the European Union. Marine Le Pen, the National Front candidate for president, has voiced sympathy for outright exit from the Euro currency. Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, leader of the Left Front, wants to assert political control over the independent European Central Bank. As they attack the EU and the euro, the far left and the far right are gaining supporters they never previously could have hoped for. One poll shows 25% of French young people supporting the National Front. The National Front is also making inroads in the traditional heartland of French social democracy, the industrial northeast. As Sarkozy and Hollande campaign from TV studios, the neo-communist MÃ©lenchon is exciting frenzied rallies in France's poorer neighborhoods. When Sarkozy and Hollande belatedly staged public meetings on Sunday, MÃ©lenchon mocked them for imitating his accessible style of campaigning: They ""will now also occupy the streets and risk appearing in public squares."" Neither Le Pen nor MÃ©lenchon has any hope of winning the presidency, nor even very much of a hope of making it to the second round. What they are doing, however, is giving expression to public distress that is going unexpressed by the mainline parties. They may not win enough votes. But they are exerting enough political force to reshape French politics and possibly the politics of all Europe. The euro was a terrible mistake. It is failing now in exactly the way predicted by its critics: a credit boom followed by a depression. The present policy response offers the people of Europe no hope at all, opening a political opportunity for extremists and demagogues. On April 22, the voters of France will tell us just how large that political opportunity has grown. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of David Frum.","France, voting next week in first round for president, sees growth of fringe parties .

"(CNN) -- A shrewd Wall Street friend once advised me: ""There's all the difference in the world between a great business and a great investment."" That's good advice to keep in mind after the drop in Facebook's share price last week. Shares in the social media company closed Friday at $21, a loss of $17 since the company's public offering in May. (It moved up by 83 cents in Monday's trading.) By any definition, Facebook has grown into a very successful business. Facebook is one of those rare companies that reshape the world. It has signed up almost 1 billion users, it collects almost $4 billion in revenues, it earns more than $1 billion in profits. Yet Facebook is rapidly proving itself a correspondingly disappointing investment -- and worse may be ahead. The stock's latest drop was triggered by a company admission that its more profitable U.S. desktop user base had ceased to grow, was now in fact shrinking, as more users access Facebook on mobile devices . Meanwhile, an advertiser raised doubts that Facebook ads generate as many clicks from consumers as the company claims, and the company said it's looking into the complaint. For a company that derives almost 90% of its revenue from ads, many of them based on per-click pricing, such doubts represent a serious challenge to its market valuation. The challenge arises because Facebook as a company has decided it cares more about its future as an investment than its future as a business. A great business ceaselessly asks itself the question: How can we serve our customers better? What products and services can we offer -- and how should we price them -- so that people will want to buy them? Such a company builds its profits upon customer satisfaction. I rent cars from Hertz about three or four times a year. Each time, I'm impressed when I notice some small way the experience is smoother and better than it was the time before. Every time I buy a new Mac computer, I'm delighted by the amazing superiority of the new machine over its predecessor. But unfortunately, some companies think in a very different way. They think: ""Our customers are basically not very intelligent people. They don't read contracts carefully. We can take advantage of their weaknesses to make more money in the short term than we'd make from a more ethical approach."" Think of the credit card companies always scheming to hit lower-income customers with small fees, or cell-phone companies that decided against developing warnings to customers when they exceed the minutes allotted by their contract, or pretty much the entire sub-prime mortgage industry . Facebook's $38 IPO price was premised on the assumption that each Facebook user was worth $100. That was a heroic assumption given that Facebook was then earning an average of only $4.84 from each existing customer -- and that most of Facebook's growth prospects are found outside the United States, where customers generate radically less revenue than do American customers. To sustain the $38 stock price -- never mind to deliver the price rises that people who bought at $38 were hoping for -- Facebook would have to find ways to increase its per-customer earnings. And as Facebook users are painfully discovering, many of those ways involve uses of customer information that some customers experience as an intrusion upon their privacy. Many Facebook customers surely think of Facebook as a communications network, just like their telephone company. If one of those customers telephones a friend to say, ""I really liked the new Batman movie,"" that customer would likely assume that the information contained in the phone call is his or her personal business. That customer would probably think that the phone company is entitled to payment for carrying the message. That customer would also hold the view that the phone company was not entitled to eavesdrop upon the message and sell advertisers the information, ""Jim or Julie liked the new Batman movie."" Ditto for most e-mail providers, for Skype, for the Post Office, for anyone else involved in the carriage of data. Facebook, however, takes the view that the information customers necessarily divulge in the course of using Facebook becomes Facebook's property to use as Facebook sees fit -- unless of course the customer affirmatively opts out by ticking the correct boxes in Facebook's notoriously confusing and repeatedly changing privacy settings. It's not a very confidence-inspiring way to run a company. More relevantly, it's a way of running a company that repeatedly defeats customer expectations. And when a company defeats its customers' expectations, it will find its customers going elsewhere. Which is what seems to be happening to Facebook in its core and most valuable market. There are two lessons in this story, one for Facebook in particular and the other for the broader U.S. economy. For Facebook, the lesson is: Business ethics matter. Facebook may regard its users' privacy concerns as irrational and outdated. Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said in 2010 that social norms had changed and people were comfortable sharing a lot more information about themselves. He said, ""Doing a privacy change for 350 million users is not the kind of thing that a lot of companies would do. But we viewed that as a really important thing, to always keep a beginner's mind and what would we do if we were starting the company now and we decided that these would be the social norms now and we just went for it."" Zuckerberg later apologized and promised to do better on protecting privacy. Yet, in general, instead of trying to convince customers to see things Facebook's way, the company has often sought to bypass those concerns in ways that many customers who don't read Facebook's legal disclosures discover only after the fact. That practice leads to a loss of trust. And trust is an asset that every company should value -- especially one that earns money by counting its own clicks. Today, as a question is raised about Facebook's advertising numbers, many of us think: ""Gee, whom should I believe? This advertiser I'd never previously heard of? Or Facebook, a company that so often acts in ways that I personally find unethical?"" For the U.S. economy, the warning is even more ominous. From a strictly economic point of view, the stock market is becoming a less and less important place. The days when companies used public markets as important sources of financing have long since passed. Increasingly, stock markets function as speculative adjuncts to the real work of business finance. Yet as stock markets have dwindled in economic importance, they have grown in political and social importance. Without the stock market, for example, Zuckerberg would be CEO of a company that falls well short of qualifying for the Fortune 500. It's the speculative actions of the market that have made Zuckerberg a multiple billionaire -- and the need to satisfy that market that could cannibalize the company he founded, built, and may now be endangering. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Facebook shares have declined sharply since it first offered stock to the public .

"(CNN) -- New York Jets running back Mike Goodson was arrested on drug and gun charges in New Jersey early Friday morning, New Jersey State Police said. According to the NFL, Goodson, from Spring, Texas, signed a three-year, $6.9 million contract with the Jets this offseason. A tow truck driver called police at 3:15 a.m. Friday when he saw a vehicle stopped in the left lane on the westbound side of Interstate 80 in Denville, police said. Goodson, 25, was the passenger in the GMC Yukon. Police found a loaded handgun, hollow-point ammunition, drug paraphernalia and a small amount of marijuana in the vehicle, said Lt. Stephen Jones, a state police spokesman. Goodson appeared to be intoxicated, Jones said, and was taken to St. Clare's Hospital in Boonton Township, where he was evaluated and treated. He was sent to state police custody upon his release, Jones said. The driver, Garant Evans of Roselle, was arrested at the scene and faces the same charges, in addition to a DWI allegation and motor vehicle tickets. Evans, 31, was a convicted felon before Friday's arrest, Jones said. Jones said Goodson and Evans are being held on full-cash bail at the Morris County Jail. Goodson's bail was set at $50,000, and Evans' was set at $150,000.","Tow truck driver saw vehicle stopped on a New Jersey interstate, police say .

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's authoritarian president Hugo Chavez is a villain out of a Batman movie: buffoonish and sinister in equal measure. Sunday's vote result powerfully exposes both sides of his clown-prince system of rule. Read more: Survivor and Venezuela's long-serving president . For weeks before the vote, Chavez signaled a willingness to surrender power, should the result go against him. On Election Day itself, he gave the Venezuelan newspaper El Universal a quote indicating he foresaw the possibility of defeat. ""Let's get ready to recognize the results, whatever they are,"" he said.. And yet just a few hours later, Venezuela's Election Agency showed Chavez winning massively, by nearly 10 percentage points. Is the result legitimate? That's hard to say. Venezuela has not invited any international election observers since 2006 and anomalies have been observed in past votes, especially the 2004 referendum to recall Chavez from the presidency . Yet it should also be said: In Venezuela, the most important forms of vote fraud happen well before Election Day. First, the Chavez regime systematically controls and manipulates the mass media, especially television. Francisco Toro, founder of the indispensable Caracas Chronicle blog writes in the New Republic: . ""Three minutes per day per broadcast outlet. That's how much advertising each candidate is allowed in Venezuela in the weeks leading up to a presidential election. That's six 30-second spots, no more. To long-suffering TV watchers in U.S. battleground states, that must sound like paradise. There's a catch, though. While each candidate's campaign is allowed no more than three minutes, the government can run as many 'institutional' ads as it wants to promote its work. And in ChÃÂ¡vez-era Venezuela, such ads are generally indistinguishable from the official campaign ads, down to using designed-to-look-alike logos."" Apart from campaign ads, however, the president himself can commandeer as much TV time as he wishes, although in the case of the long-winded Chavez, such appearances may not be vote-winners. More relevant to the success of the president's messaging is the regime's habit of seizing TV stations that broadcast journalism of which the authorities disapprove. Along with state media control goes massive government vote-buying. News: Six more years with Chavez . The Los Angeles Times reports: ""Chavez in recent months has solidified his support base with massive giveaway programs, including one that aims to build 200,000 housing units for Venezuela's poor. Another, called Mi Casa Bien Equipada, or My Well-Equipped House, has donated Chinese-made household appliances to tens of thousands of poor families."" The use of state oil funds for this kind of electioneering is driving Venezuela's budget deficit for the year to the astounding level of 20% of GDP, an incredible figure for an oil-exporting economy at a time of very high oil prices. (Context: The U.S. budget deficits that have so alarmed people during the Obama years never reached as much as 9% of GDP.) Venezuelan politics is distorted most of all by a pervasive mood of threat. I visited Venezuela in 2010. My visit began with a briefing at the U.S. Embassy. ""You've been to Afghanistan?"" Yes. ""You've been to Iraq?"" Yes. ""Well, congratulations. This is the most dangerous place you've ever been."" Venezuala, with a population smaller than Canada's, suffers more homicides than the United States. Robberies at gunpoint -- ""express kidnappings"" as they are called -- are regular occurrences in middle-class neighborhoods. And if middle-class neighborhoods evince any disaffection from the regime, they lose what little police protection they have, or even discover the police suddenly abetting and aiding the criminals that prey upon their community. Property is seized. Businesses are arbitrarily nationalized. Conversations are eavesdropped upon. The Internet is policed, at least to the best of the (very limited) ability of Venezuela's not very competent security forces. Hugo Chavez has laid Venezuela's economy to waste. One of the world's great energy producers must turn its streetlamps off at night. One of the world's wealthiest exporters cannot afford to import enough food. One of the world's energy superpowers is seeing its production slowly dwindle away because of chronic under-investment in the oil fields and the loss of access to technology as foreign companies are harassed and expropriated. Did Venezuela vote for more of the same? Chavez does have a militant populist constituency, and it's not impossible that the final result does reflect what the voters actually did. But then, Vladimir Putin wins elections, too, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won at least one. It is not elections alone that make a free society -- and a free society is what Venezuela long ago ceased to be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Venezuela's Hugo Chavez has won; his system of rule suspect, sinister .

"(CNN) -- Congratulations: If you're reading this, you have electricity. Unfortunately, more than 3 million Americans this weekend couldn't join you. The sweltering heat wave that roasted the eastern United States was accompanied by terrible storms that have knocked out power lines up and down the seaboard. While you enjoy your air conditioning, you might want to take a minute to consider: Why do Americans tolerate such outages? Outages are not inevitable. The German power grid has outages at an average rate of 21 minutes per year. Millions still without power amid record heat wave . The winds may howl. The trees may fall. But in Germany, the lights stay on. There's no Teutonic engineering magic to this impressive record. It's achieved by a very simple decision: Germany buries almost all of its low-voltage and medium-voltage power lines, the lines that serve individual homes and apartments. Americans could do the same. They have chosen not to. The choice has been made for reasons of cost. The industry rule of thumb is that it costs about 10 times as much to bury wire as to string wire overhead: up to $1 million per mile, industry representatives claim. Since American cities are much less dense than European ones, there would be a lot more wire to string to serve a U.S. population than a European one. Cost matters. But now reflect: . 1. There's reason to think that industry estimates of the cost of burying wires are inflated. While the U.S. industry guesstimates costs, a large-scale study of the problem conducted recently in the United Kingdom estimated the cost premium at 4.5 to 5.5 times the cost of overhead wire, not 10. 2. U.S. cost figures are a moving target. American cities are becoming denser as the baby boomers age and opt for central-city living, as I discussed in a previous column. Denser cities require fewer miles of wire to serve their populations. 3. Costs can only be understood in relation to benefits. As the climate warms, storms and power outages are becoming more common. And as the population ages, power failures become more dangerous. In France, where air conditioning is uncommon, a 2003 heat wave left 10,000 people dead, almost all of them elderly. If burying power lines prevented power outages during the hotter summers ahead, the decision could save many lives. Photos: Extreme heat strikes U.S. 4. As you may have heard, we're suffering very severe unemployment just at present. Joblessness is acute among less educated workers, many of whom used to work in the now severely depressed construction industry. Burying power lines is a project that could put many hundreds of thousands of the unemployed to work at tasks that make use of their skills and experience. Meanwhile, the federal government is able to borrow vast sums of money at the lowest interest rates since the Great Depression. The Obama stimulus has to date failed to produce many projects of lasting benefit to the country. But here's one that our children and grandchildren would appreciate -- and that might save our parents' lives. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Millions on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard lost power in bad weather this week .

"(CNN) -- ""It's not fair!"" As advertisers quit the Rush Limbaugh radio program -- and as Republican politicians squirm uncomfortably -- the broadcaster's fans are complaining about double standards. Yes, they'll concede, maybe Limbaugh went too far in denouncing a female law student as a ""slut"" and a ""prostitute"" and then demanding that she post a sex tape online for him to view. But look (they continue) at all the liberal/lefty broadcasters who have also said obnoxious things! No one calls Democratic politicians to account for them. Why us? It's a question that will be aired often in the week ahead. Here's the answer, in four points. Point 1: Even by the rough standards of cable/talk radio/digital talk, Limbaugh's verbal abuse of Sandra Fluke set a new kind of low. I can't recall anything as brutal, ugly and deliberate ever being said by such a prominent person and so emphatically repeated. This was not a case of a bad ""word choice."" It was a brutally sexualized accusation, against a specific person, prolonged over three days. Point 2: The cases that conservatives cite as somehow equivalent to Limbaugh's tirade against Fluke by and large did bring consequences for their authors. After David Letterman for example made an ugly joke about Sarah Palin's daughter, he delivered an abject seven-minute apology on air. (To which Palin responded by refusing the apology and insinuating that David Letterman was a child molester.) When liberal talker Ed Schultz nastily called my dear friend Laura Ingraham a ""slut"" on his radio show, MSNBC responded by suspending Schultz for a week without pay from his TV show. Schultz likewise apologized in person on air. (Ingraham accepted the apology with grace and humor.) The exception to the general rule is Bill Maher, who never apologized for calling Palin by a demeaning sexual epithet. But now see point 3: . Point 3: Limbaugh's place in American public life is in no way comparable to that of David Letterman, Bill Maher or Ed Schultz. Letterman is not a political figure at all; and while Maher and Schultz strongly identify as liberals, neither qualifies as anything like a powerbroker in the Democratic Party. I'm sure the Barack Obama re-election effort is happy to have Maher's million-dollar gift, but I sincerely doubt there is a Democratic congressman who worries much whether Maher criticizes him. A word of criticism from Limbaugh, by contrast, will reduce almost any member of the Republican caucus to abject groveling. See, for example: GINGREY, PHIL. Among TV and radio talkers and entertainers, there is none who commands anything like the deference that Limbaugh commands from Republicans: not Rachel Maddow, not Jon Stewart, not Michael Moore, not Keith Olbermann at his zenith. Democratic politicians may wish for favorable comment from their talkers, but they are not terrified of negative comment from them in the way that Republican politicians live in fear of a negative word from Limbaugh. The ultimate test came in 2002, the vote to authorize force against Iraq. Almost every liberal talker opposed that vote. Hillary Clinton, with her eye on a presidential run in 2008, voted in favor. That is why no one asks Democratic politicians to repudiate the latest strident statement from an Olbermann or a Moore. There's no sport in it. It's too easy for them to say, ""Sure."" For Republicans, it's tough. But maybe, after this latest outburst, a little less tough? TIME.com: Erica Christakis on why men are the missing element in the contraception debate . Point 4: Most fundamentally, why the impulse to counter one outrageous stunt by rummaging through the archives in search of some supposedly offsetting outrageous stunt? Why not respond to an indecent act on its own terms, and then -- if there's another indecency later -- react to that too, and on its own terms? Instead, public life is reduced to a revenge drama. Each offense is condoned by reference to some previous offense by some undefined ""them"" who supposedly once did something even worse, or anyway nearly as bad, at some point in the past. But this latest Limbaugh outburst is so ""piggish,"" to borrow a word from Peggy Noonan, as to overwhelm the revenge drama. (On Saturday, Limbaugh apologized ""for the insulting word choices."") It is the bottom of the barrel of shock talk. And the good news is that from the bottom of the barrel, there is nowhere to go but up. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Limbaugh's backers assert liberal talkers also guilty of outrageous statements .
He says the hunt for equally offensive comments is a waste of time .
Frum: No one on the left holds the power broker position Rush Limbaugh has on the right .
Even by the standards of radio talk, Limbaugh's tirade was a new low, Frum says ."
"(CNN) -- Compare and contrast the economic plan Mitt Romney released in September with the speech he delivered Friday in Detroit. The plan was published as a downloadable e-book, introduced by a former chair of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, Columbia business school dean Glenn Hubbard. It was the product of heavy research and careful thought. The plan rejected further early tax cuts for high-income individuals, saying instead: . ""We need taxes to pay for the operations of government. But they should be collected by a system that is simple and fair, and that causes the least possible disruption to the productive economy. ""While the entire tax code is in dire need of a fundamental overhaul, Mitt Romney believes in holding the line against increases in marginal tax rates. The goals that President Bush pursued in bringing rates down to their current level -- to spur economic growth, encourage savings and investment, and help struggling Americans make ends meet -- are just as important today as they were a decade ago. Letting them lapse, as President Obama promises to do in 2012, is a step in precisely the wrong direction. If anything, the lower rates established by President Bush should be regarded as a directional marker on the road to more fundamental reform. "" (Italics added.) By contrast, the Detroit speech seems to have been written on the back of an envelope. The only thought that went into it was: How do we rev up the base so that we can win the next primaries? Romney said: . ""First, I will make an across-the-board, 20% reduction in marginal individual income tax rates [tax brackets]. By reducing the tax on the next dollar of income earned by all taxpayers, we will encourage hard work, risk-taking, and productivity by allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn. ""The businesses that pay taxes through the individual income tax system account for more than half of all private sector jobs in the United States. So this tax cut will encourage businesses to hire, raise wages, and grow the economy."" No effort is made to corroborate these claims for the economic benefits of a further 20% tax cut. Corroboration is not needed in a speech intended narrowly for the pre-convinced. But wait -- won't such a big tax cut, piled atop the previous commitment to renew the Bush tax cuts when they expire in 2013, greatly add to the deficit? Especially when joined to new promises to permanently abolish the Alternative Minimum Tax and estate tax? How will the federal budget be balanced? Not with cuts to current Medicare beneficiaries, the speech hastens to assure. ""Tax hikes are off the table, and there will be no change for those at or near retirement."" Medicare and Social Security reform will not begin until 2022. Yet the tax cuts are supposed to go into effect right away. How to close the gap? Growth, of course, will help. But mostly, the speech suggests that the gap will be closed with big cuts to programs for the poor, such as ""food stamps, housing subsidies, and job training."" What about the social costs of imposing such big cuts on a population that has by no means recovered from the economic catastrophe of 2008-2009? Do the numbers even add up? One might cynically answer: Who cares? The speech is not intended as policy. It's intended to corral Republican primary voters. If Romney wins the election in November, that will be the time to think seriously about economic plans. Yet cynicism is not always as sophisticated as it thinks it is. However short-term the motivations behind it, Romney's speech in Michigan will have heavy consequences for at least four reasons: . â¢ Even if the speech does not strictly qualify as a flip-flop, it does continue the pattern of Romney yielding under pressure from the GOP base. Winning candidates look for ways to demonstrate independence from party dogma. In 2008, Barack Obama did it by praising Ronald Reagan and preaching the importance of fathers. George W. Bush did it with his October 1999 speech repudiating claims that the U.S. was ""slouching toward Gomorrah."" Bill Clinton of course had his Sister Souljah speech. Romney instead is following the Walter Mondale approach of knuckling his forehead to every interest group in the party. Each succeeding act of submission makes him look weaker. â¢ Romney has now wholly identified himself as the candidate of the rich and the old. Nothing is to be asked from those over 55. Much is to be given to upper-income earners. All the burden of fiscal adjustment is to be piled on the poor and the young. When Republicans invoke the memory of Ronald Reagan, they ought to remember how powerfully Reagan spoke to the aspirations of young Americans -- and how the support of young Americans in turn made the oldest of American presidents appear exciting to voters in every age group. Today's Republican party goes out of its way to show contempt and hostility to the young -- an attitude that will have consequences for a long time to come. â¢ It's not impossible that Romney may win this election. If he does, he'll find that his speech in Detroit surrendered the initiative for his first year in office to the Republicans in the House. They will want to pass the tax cut first. Romney has now endorsed it, so how can he say no? They will want to do some version of the Paul Ryan budget next. Ditto. And whoosh, there goes his first year -- and all the priorities that his September plan and his own book suggested he regards as more important: tax reform, trade, etc. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist will be proved right: Romney will have reduced himself to a signing machine for a government whose real power is centered in Capitol Hill. â¢ If Medicare, Social Security and defense are off the table -- and if the rest of the government is not to be obliterated entirely -- then hopes of deficit reduction after Romney's big tax cut will rest on the country zooming to Chinese levels of economic growth. What if that growth does not appear? It's one thing to incur dreadful deficits during the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. The Romney plan threatens to institutionalize those deficits even during the period of recovery ahead. Compassionate conservatism has been dead for a long time. Romney's Detroit speech cremated the remains. As a man, Romney remains far and away the most capable of the presidential candidates seeking the Republican nomination. But he has now finally eliminated the policy differences separating him from the radical congressional wing. If Romney should win the Republican nomination, moderate and independent voters nationwide will be forced to decide: If they vote for Romney, who is it they're truly voting for? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Mitt Romney's Friday speech flies in face of his economic plan .

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Even though House Republicans are now wisely folding their tents, their disarray this week over extending a payroll tax cut has left a sour taste at year's end in Washington, contributing in no small part to an even bigger political story: the resurrection of President Obama and his fellow Democrats heading toward the 2012 elections. After the debt ceiling debacle of last summer, the conventional wisdom among many political analysts was that Obama would go the way of President Jimmy Carter, that Republicans would lose a few seats in the House but retain control, and that the GOP would surge into power in the Senate. In short, Republicans were looking for a clean sweep. Who believes that now? Obama is still highly vulnerable and could lose, but the CNN poll coming out of the field this week reveals a remarkable turnaround, especially in the past month. In a mid-November survey, when asked which candidate they were more likely to support, registered voters gave Mitt Romney a lead of 4 percentage points over Obama, 51% to 47%. The mid-December survey found an 11-point switch; Obama now has a 52%-45% edge over Romney. Against Newt Gingrich, Obama has a 16-point lead, 56%-40%. (Ironically, the one Republican candidate who does as well against Obama as Romney is Rep Ron Paul, trailing by the same 52%-45% margin.) It is too early to tell how much Democratic prospects for the Senate and House have improved, but senior Republicans are worried. John King pointed out one straw in the wind Wednesday night on CNN's ""AC360."": the Massachusetts Senate race, where a poll has shown Democratic populist Elizabeth Warren grabbing an unexpected lead over Republican populist Scott Brown. Only a few months ago, the Brown forces were supremely confident. Brown has seen how much danger the payroll tax mess can pose for his re-election and was one of the first to condemn House Republicans for rejecting a Senate compromise that had overwhelming, bipartisan support. For Brown and other GOP candidates in blue and purple states, the hard-liners in the House are playing directly into a narrative that Democrats have been promoting for months: that Washington is broken because the GOP has become hostage to the tea party. With sentiment toward the tea party now running 49%-33% unfavorable in CNN polling, that is potent stuff. The truth about the breakdown in Washington is much more complicated (Democrats deserve ample blame, too), but Republican congressional leaders have so mishandled the payroll tax issue that they have made it easy for the charge to stick. As The Wall Street Journal said in its scathing editorial, the GOP has also strengthened Obama's arguments that he is more on the side of middle-class taxpayers than Republicans are. No wonder the White House is quietly chortling and senior Republicans like GOP leader Mitch McConnell pressed hard for House Republicans to cave on the payroll tax cut. There are two other major forces at work that have been lifting Democratic hopes. One is the quality of the Republican presidential race. With less than two weeks left before the Iowa caucuses, as The Boston Globe reports Thursday, it is apparent that no one has captured the imagination of GOP voters. We are back to where we started: a sense the field is weak and people wondering whether a Jeb Bush or a Chris Christie will get off the sidelines. All primary campaigns draw candidates toward the extreme end of their parties, but this year, with so many debates, there has been a danger all along for Republicans that moderates and independents would also be driven off. (In the CNN poll, moderates now give Obama a sizable lead against every GOP candidate.) The other force driving the change in outlook is Obama himself. What he does best, as we have learned, is campaign. In domestic affairs, he has been far better at that than governing. He and his team apparently made a decision after the debt ceiling fight that he should be much less involved in leading Washington and instead hit the campaign trail. From my perspective, that's not good for the country -- witness how appallingly little has been accomplished this fall on jobs and the deficits -- but it seems to be working for his re-election. None of this is to say that Obama and Democrats have become clear favorites for next fall. The fluidity we have seen among Republican primary voters may well show up in the general electorate. As Romney has been arguing, the GOP is likely to close its ranks more fully once a nominee has been crowned. The improving tone of the economy -- also a factor for Obama -- could well be short-lived: As The New York Times reported Thursday, economists tend to think that growth could slow again next year. And that dark cloud called the euro zone is still hovering. Even so, we are witnessing an important change in the political landscape -- and it could be lasting. Republicans well remember the mid-1990s when they seized power in Congress and Speaker Newt Gingrich went mano-a-mano with President Bill Clinton. For a while, Gingrich had the upper hand, but Clinton then outmaneuvered him on two governmental shutdowns -- and when the momentum turned in Clinton's favor, he rode it to an easy re-election. No one should doubt that could happen again.

"Boston (CNN) -- Across the country, fans of the New England Patriots are wondering whether Tom Brady will return to top form this Sunday, whether Gronk's ankle will hold up, and whether cornerback Julian Edelman can shut down the Giants' dangerous receivers. But here in Beantown, folks ask still another question: Will the Pats go out and win this one for Myra? The passing of an owner's wife is rarely a source of inspiration in professional sports, but the Patriots have long thought that Myra Kraft was different. That's why they have woven an insignia bearing her initials into their jerseys: She has been their talisman this season and will be for the season's finale. A little bit of background helps to explain. Myra's husband, Bob Kraft, bought the Patriots in 1994 when it was a broken-down, struggling franchise. Since then, he has built it into one of the pre-eminent franchises in professional sports, with Myra as a close, constant partner. The Patriots racked up victories on the shoulders of a topflight quarterback in Brady, an ingenious coach in Bill Belichick -- but they won the respect of others around the league in large part thanks to Bob's forthright leadership and Myra's heart of gold. In fact, as Bob once recalled to The Associated Press, Myra was the one who balked when he was planning to buy the Patriots for a then-record $172 million: ""She was afraid it would affect our charitable giving."" Bob assured her, ""We will do more for the community if we run this franchise correctly"" -- and he was right. Her contributions to humanity range from monumental gestures to everyday acts of kindness. She managed the Robert and Myra Kraft Family Foundation and the New England Patriots Charitable Foundation, which contributed millions of dollars to charities across the United States and in Israel, focusing on everything from education to poverty to cancer research. She headed the board of United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley and was the first woman to chair the Boys & Girls Club of Boston. Frequently, she opened their home to Israelis studying at Harvard on Wexner fellowships. She and her husband also loved their large, boisterous family. A couple of years ago, the Krafts invited one of us (David along with wife Anne) to join them for a seder dinner during Passover. The room was crowded with almost three dozen children, grandchildren and friends. As the only Christians there, we were entranced as Bob asked every grandchild to read and Myra made each of us feel absolutely special. Although married to a man who Forbes lists with a net worth of $1.7 billion, Myra always made time to serve food in soup kitchens, to pack bags full of donated clothes, to bond with anyone around her. And she often persuaded Patriot players to serve alongside her. Former Pats running back Curtis Martin still remembers how much he enjoyed her chicken noodle soup. ""I used to give Myra Kraft a kiss before every game,"" 325-pound defensive tackle Vince Wilfork recalled to The Boston Globe. She mattered to the players so much that, following her death at age 68 in July, the whole team commissioned a painting in her memory and presented it to Bob in an emotional locker room ceremony celebrating a late-season victory. Her memory also made the famously ice-cold Belichick choke up in a radio interview. And she struck a deep chord with fans, too. One of the biggest ovations in the AFC Championship came when someone held up 3-foot-high cutouts of her initials for all of Gillette Stadium to see. She rarely interceded in football operations, but fans happily recall how she nixed the drafting of a Nebraska linebacker with a criminal history of abusing women. With characteristic pluck and fearlessness, she advised Bob to dig deeper, and that was that -- the Patriots waived their rights to the player almost immediately after the draft, a previously unheard-of move. And while she was already beset this past summer by cancer. her deep connection with her husband -- and the grief so widely shared upon her passing -- is credited by many around the league with helping end the lockout that threatened this NFL season itself. Who will forget the timeless photo of the enormous Indianapolis center Jeff Saturday embracing Bob Kraft just days after Myra's death? Myra Kraft was not a large woman. But as Dr. Gary Gottlieb, president of Partners HealthCare (another nonprofit she supported vigorously), told the Globe, ""As diminutive as her physical size was, it was in inverse proportion to the size of her heart and soul."" So that will be the legacy on the minds of the New England Patriots -- and the cheering faithful -- as the team suits up this Sunday. It's a legacy that highlights the very best in football and brings out the very best in players. Steve Buckley of The Boston Herald notes that at halftime in the last game of the regular season, with the Pats down 21-0 to the Bills, Bob asked an assistant to bring that painting of Myra down from his office and place it in their locker room. The team roared back, scoring 49 unanswered points. ""Myra Kraft meant more to this than probably any of us that are playing this game,"" Wilfork told the Globe. ""She's the foundation. Hopefully we can get it done for her."" The fans here in New England are confident their team can. With a foundation that strong, they're eager to see the Patriots go out and win one for Myra -- and for the timeless values she championed. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- In the cold light of morning, Mitt Romney still looks like the man to beat for the Republican presidential nomination, but the buzz Tuesday night in the debate hall and since has mostly centered on Newt Gingrich. Given up for dead only a few months ago, his campaign seemingly in shambles, Gingrich has tripled his standing in the polls in a little over a month and even leads Romney in some of them. That may say a lot about Romney, but it also shows that Gingrich must now be taken seriously. The Tuesday debate illustrated the strengths and the dangers that Gingrich brings to the campaign. Romney, who had a little less speaking time than Gingrich, was crisp and once again showed a command of the issues. But as his own team seemed to realize, he didn't stand out as he often has in the past. Instead, it was Gingrich who seized the spotlight: He was both more interesting and more of a gambler. Political analysts since the debate have been wondering nonstop how much he may have hurt himself by going ""soft"" on immigration. Early reports out of Iowa suggest he will pay a price there. But was it a shrewder move than many analysts assume? For what it's worth, my own bet is that he will take a temporary hit but in the long term, he may strengthen his prospects. For one thing, he has shown he is willing to stand up for his convictions (not a bad offset against Romney). Second, he is in effect asking voters to take a second look at him -- and betting that they may like the ""new Newt"" better than the old one. We will see. For decades, Gingrich has been regarded as one of the smartest, most creative figures in politics. No one else could have engineered the GOP takeover of the House in 1994 in the way he did nor achieved what he did in his early years as speaker. But during that time, he also acquired a reputation as a bomb thrower who could be bombastic, erratic and an intellectual bully. His best friends saw that he had enormous strengths and yet worried about his weaknesses, both professional and personal. Few thought him ready for the White House. As he re-emerges into the spotlight now, an important question is whether he is the same Newt as before or whether he has changed. Talking with him and then listening to him as he spoke 10 days ago at the Harvard Kennedy School, I sensed that the years may have brought a maturing, a rounding and a steadiness that could serve him well. Certainly, he seems happier and more rooted in his personal life -- Callista, his third wife, is constantly by his side and is both partner and confidante. Whether these are deep, genuine changes is hard to say. He drew headlines in recent days with his suggestion to weaken child labor laws so students could take the place of school janitors and his reference to the Congressional Budget Office as a ""reactionary socialist institution."" It is easy to be cynical. But the Newt of the Tuesday debate surprised a lot of people. He showed a humanity on the immigration issue that might worry the base but also suggests a greater appreciation and empathy for the travails of others. Americans like that in their presidents (see FDR). One wonders whether Gingrich has become wiser and more forgiving after wrestling with his own personal failings and now asking voters for another chance. The next few weeks will be crucial for the Gingrich campaign. He knows that he will undergo intense vetting from the media and his opponents -- he has been smart to go on the offense through the Internet. Voters may well decide he is too much of a risk. But if he survives near the top of the polls, he is the first alternative to Romney who has the chops to win the nomination. For now, despite the polls, Romney seems a much more likely choice. He has the money, the organization and the personal capacity. A day after the debate, Intrade has been putting Romney's chances for the nomination at 67% compared with 13% for Gingrich (interestingly, Jon Huntsman is at third). But the Romney forces know they may have a real fight on their hands -- especially if voters decide there is a ""new Newt"" in town. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen: Newt Gingrich generated the most buzz at CNN debate .

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, politicians and pundits liked to say, ""9/11 changed everything."" For a while, it seemed true. Now it seems like a vanished era. Today, nothing changes anything. No matter what happens, our thinking remains frozen exactly in place, impervious to new experience and new evidence. On December 14 of last year, a deranged man fatally shot and killed 20 students and six teachers with an assault-style rifle, the second deadliest mass shooting in American history. In response, the country has done ... nothing whatsoever. No changes to gun laws. No changes in the treatment of the mentally ill. Last week, a Senate filibuster stopped the milk-and-water Toomey-Manchin proposal to tighten (slightly) background checks on would-be gun purchasers. Early in 2013, Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News reported Adam Lanza's obsessive fascination with prior mass murders. ""[I]nvestigators found ... a chilling spreadsheet 7 feet long and 4 feet wide that required a special printer, a document that contained Lanza's obsessive, extensive research Ã¢â¬â in nine-point font Ã¢â¬â about mass murders of the past, and even attempted murders. But it wasn't just a spreadsheet. It was a score sheet. 'We were told (Lanza) had around 500 people on this sheet,' a law enforcement veteran told me Saturday night. 'Names and the number of people killed and the weapons that were used, even the precise make and model of the weapons. It had to have taken years. It sounded like a doctoral thesis, that was the quality of the research.'"" The next would-be mass murderer can take up Lanza's obsession from where he left off, with not a single new barrier in his way. Virginia Tech (the deadiest school shooting in U.S. history back in 2007) made no difference. The Aurora movie theater mass murder made no difference. The attack on former Rep. Gabby Giffords made no difference. Nothing changes anything. It's not just guns. With economics too, nothing changes anything. Over four years, policymakers in Europe and the United States have argued about public debt. In a recession, should government run deficits to substitute for weakened consumer demand? Or should they cut spending to balance their budgets, accepting pain now to avoid even greater pain later? Republicans in the United States and the German government in Europe have argued for the second option. Advocates of austerity cited a powerful study by two acclaimed economists, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. The Reinhart-Rogoff study demonstrated (or appeared to demonstrate) that once public debt climbed past 90% of GDP, a country's future growth slowed, putting at risk the entire next generation. Then, last week, a 28-year-old graduate student demonstrated that the Rogoff-Reinhart study contained a basic spreadsheet error. Correct the arithmetic, and you found that the connection between public debt and future growth was almost perfectly random: sometimes high-debt countries grew; sometimes they didn't; it all depended on other factors. The most important piece of advice in favor of the ""cut now"" school of thought collapsed into rubble. And the result? Nothing, barely even a word of acknowledgment from the people who'd been citing the study and condemning people to the harmful effects of austerity for the past four years. Nothing changes anything. On this site a few days ago, CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette expressed worry that the Boston bombing, allegedly by two alienated young immigrants, might harm the prospects for the Senate immigration deal. He needn't fret. Nothing changes anything. The Fort Hood massacre changed nothing. The Time Square bombing attempt changed nothing. The presence of so many of the 9/11 hijackers on overstayed visas has changed nothing: there is still no mechanism for confirming that persons who enter on visas depart on time. Why would one expect Boston to change anything.? The immigration debate has been resisting new information for years, not only in the traumatic and of course rare instances of terrorist acts by immigrants and their children, but even more in labor economics. Much thinking about immigration remains shaped by statistics from 30 and 40 years ago, when immigrants arrived with higher levels of education than natives and equaled native wages within a decade. We don't need horrifying acts of violence to prove that the United States is choosing its immigrants unwisely. Until 1970, immigrants to the United States were better educated than natives. Immigrants who arrived before 1970 took a decade or so to adjust, but then earned more than natives. Since 1970, however, the skill levels of immigrants to the United States has sharply deteriorated. Relying on data from the 2010 Census, the Center of Immigration Studies observes: . -- 23% of all immigrants and their U.S.-born children live in poverty, almost double the rate for U.S. natives; . -- Immigrants and their children accounted for one-fourth of all persons living in poverty; . -- Immigrant-headed households are 50% more likely than the native-born to use at least one welfare assistance program, such as food stamps or Medicaid. Yet even so, the president and the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" insist: the United States must continue to keep its doors open to the least skilled and ought to actually increase its total immigration intake, as well as granting legal status and eventually citizenship to the present illegal population. Nothing changes anything. You might almost call it a testament to human fortitude, if the results were not so perverse and the outcomes so costly.

"(CNN) -- Years from now, historians are likely to look back upon Barack Obama's second inaugural address as a rich treasure trove for understanding his presidency and possibly the course of American politics. It wasn't as important for his rise to power as his 2004 address to the Democratic National Convention. That one propelled him onto the national stage. It wasn't as elegant as his Philadelphia speech on race relations in the 2008 campaign. That one was his rhetorical masterpiece. But the second inaugural was far more important than either in defining his political philosophy as president. Politics: After inauguration, political reality returns to Washington . Here's a first rough draft of what historians may find significant: . Obama revealed: The Obama who took the oath of office this week seemed not only more confident but also liberated. A central point of his address was that he inherited an economic crisis and two wars but now the nation is emerging into a clearing. This, he believes, is a golden opportunity for fresh action -- a moment to be seized. Left unspoken were two other reasons why he feels liberated: He clearly thinks he has shown the country that Republicans aren't willing to compromise, so that he has no choice but to try to muscle them. The GOP has now blinked twice on the fiscal cliff and the new debt ceiling; he plans to make them keep blinking. Then, too, Obama is also freed up because he is no longer working under the shadow of the 2010 midterm elections when he was snookered. After his convincing win in 2012, he is back on top politically. Opinion: Obama's ringing defense of liberalism . All of this has inspired the president to reveal to the world his true political philosophy: In one speech, he gave the strongest embrace of 20th-century liberalism since Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society. Yes, he gave a couple of bows to the importance of individual initiative and private enterprise, but the heart and soul of the address was a call to collective action on a wide array of fronts. Gone were the third way of Bill Clinton and the centrism of Jimmy Carter. He emerged as an unapologetic, unabashed liberal -- just what the left has long wanted him to be and exactly what the right has feared. Heir to Lincoln and King: A little more than three decades ago, Ronald Reagan moved the inaugural ceremony from the east side of the Capitol to the west. For Reagan, the symbolism was that of a Californian who wanted to give his inaugural address gazing out across the National Mall, the monuments and Arlington Cemetery toward the Pacific. But for Obama, the symbolism was very different: He was the president who looked west toward the monuments of Abraham Lincoln and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his address artfully tied him to their legacy. The historian Garry Wills won a Pulitzer Prize some years ago with his book on Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in 1863. Wills argued that for most of America's early history, people thought that the republic was born with the Constitution of 1787 and the Declaration of Independence was a secondary document. Opinion: Anti-government era is over . Along came Lincoln at Gettysburg saying that the country was born ""four score and seven years ago"" -- in 1776 with the declaration. In Wills' view, now widely accepted, Lincoln at Gettysburg turned the declaration's second paragraph into the founding creed of the country. What we must aspire to, Lincoln was saying, was to ensure that all are created equal. King came to the Lincoln Memorial 100 years later -- in 1963 -- to go back to Lincoln at Gettysburg and through him to the declaration. The nation, King said, must live up to the promise of equal opportunity -- and indeed, that was the dream he so eloquently expressed in the finest American speech since Gettysburg. Enter Obama at his second inaugural, not only on King's official holiday but 50 years after ""I Have a Dream"" and 150 years after Gettysburg. The president's address begins with a recitation of the declaration, calls it our ""founding creed"" and makes the aspiration of equal opportunity the central goal of his presidency. In the past, presidents at inaugurations have found the nation's heroes among those who have died in battle. Obama chose a different path: He found the nation's heroes at Seneca Falls, Selma and Stonewall. His philosophy, as we learned, is not just about government programs but about embracing inclusion and diversity. It was, I believe, his firmest attempt to build upon Lincoln and King -- and in effect, his address made him their modern heir. Opinion: GOP, play offense in Obama's second term . Setting a new course: A president's inaugural address often sets the tone and direction of his next four years in office and nowhere may that be more true than with Obama's second. His assertive address has heartened his supporters so that they seem ready to march into battle with him. They not only want him to succeed, but they now have an ambitious agenda to embrace as well. Smartly, the president's team began putting together a new citizens group, Organizing for Action, just before the inauguration, and his speech was in effect a call to arms. Whether ""OFA"", as Democrats in Washington already call it, will work well with the Democratic Party is open to question, but it is clear that Obama & Co. intend to use it as an important way to rally public pressure on Congress for his agenda. On the other side of the aisle, many Republicans such as Eric Cantor were respectful of the president after his address but underneath most of them were bristling. They had expected the president to issue a ritualistic plea for bipartisanship and then to begin negotiating with them over federal deficits. Instead, he made it clear that he will work with them as long as they agree with him and try to run over them if they resist. From the GOP perspective, Obama was virtually dismissive of the nation's fiscal threats and wasn't interested in true negotiations. In a tweet after the speech, scholar Ian Bremmer captured their view of Obama's message to the GOP: ""Together, we shall pursue my objectives."" Opinion: World to Obama -- You can't ignore us . In short, the divisions in Washington may grow even deeper in the near term, if that is possible, and no one knows what will actually be accomplished. Among partisans on both sides, there is still a sense that a piece of gun control can be passed (starting with background checks) and perhaps a larger piece of immigration (starting with H-1B visas and legal status for the undocumented). But serious action on climate change seems distant. More centrally, the parties seem even further apart on a budget agreement. The GOP is in no mood to revisit higher taxes and the president's address gave a ringing endorsement to the basic structure of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. In short, the road ahead looks even rockier than it seemed after the elections. On the day before the inaugural, a New York Times article by Jodi Kantor reported that after the first term, Obama has warned possible candidates for his job that it is very difficult to get things done in Washington and that the president has a ""contracted sense of possibility."" He and his team are also aware that power seeps away quickly in a second term. How, one wondered, is it possible to reconcile those views with Obama's decision to go big at the inaugural, pushing an extraordinarily ambitious agenda. That question still lingers after the inauguration. It is just possible that what he was ultimately doing in his address was to present the country with a liberal vision of the future and a legislative agenda to go with it -- something akin to what Franklin Roosevelt did in 1944. FDR left behind a Democratic Party with a majority coalition and an agenda that drove American politics for more than 20 years. Is that the legacy that Obama really wants to leave? Lincoln, King, FDR -- all rolled into one? Only historians will know the answer for sure. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen says historians will look on Obama's speech as an important source .

"(CNN) -- With July Fourth upon us, many are pausing to ask why America is special -- and how we see that reflected in our politics. The Hollywood screenwriter Aaron Sorkin kicked off the debate early with his first episode of HBO's ""The Newsroom."" In a scene that has generated a lot of buzz, a young woman rises from a college audience to ask the protagonist (played by Jeff Daniels) what makes America the greatest nation on Earth. He shrugs her off: ""The New York Jets."" Pressed by the moderator to give a real answer, he dodges again. Eventually the protagonist breaks -- and delivers a jeremiad, declaring that America is no longer the greatest country in the world, that it is losing its soul, but that it used to be great and, yes, can still right itself. Some critics tore into Sorkin, arguing that the show crossed the line into petulance and preachiness (one of us, Mike, is in this camp). Others found the scene inspiring and wondered why today's presidential candidates don't speak to the country like that (David is in this camp). So, the question lingers this July Fourth: What makes America special? Strikingly, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have different takes on American exceptionalism -- and indeed, on what values are most important. Each is on record calling America the greatest nation on Earth, but they seem to believe so for different reasons, in different ways. News: We're No. 1! We're No. 1! We're ... uh ... not? Romney takes an old-fashioned, Main Street view: Like the young woman in ""The Newsroom,"" he makes no secret that he thinks America is the greatest nation in history. For him, Americans are a chosen people who continue to live out the view of the Puritan John Winthrop that we should be as a city upon a hill, an experiment in democracy and liberty that inspires the world. Almost every recent president has evoked that image, no one more so than Ronald Reagan. President Obama, back in 2009, found himself in hot water for giving voice to a different version of American exceptionalism: ""I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."" (Obama went on to say: ""I am enormously proud of my country and its role and history in the world...[a]nd I think that we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our body of law, in our democratic practices, in our belief in free speech and equality that, though imperfect, are exceptional."") Belief: The power of American exceptionalism . Romney (along with other GOP hopefuls) has seized on comments like that to make pride in America a centerpiece of his campaign (slogan: ""Believe in America""). Firing up Wisconsin voters in advance of the state's GOP primary in March, he told them: ""Our president doesn't have the same feelings about American exceptionalism that we do."" Many of Romney's stump and victory speeches have attacked Obama as an apologist and offered paeans to the nation (including, in Florida, memorably bursting into song with ""America the Beautiful."") Obama's account, by contrast, is grounded in the approach taken toward American exceptionalism on many campuses today. Seymour Martin Lipset, a world-class sociologist and no liberal (he was closely associated with the American Enterprise Institute), advanced the argument most cogently some years ago. America, he insisted, is not exceptional because it is better than everyone else; it is exceptional because it is different, an outlier embracing a unique set of values. As the British philosopher G.K. Chesteron once wrote: ""America is the only nation in the world that is founded on a creed."" What comprises that creed is open to some debate, but Lipset hypothesized that Americans espouse five core values, stemming from key historical experiences, that distinguish us from other Western nations: liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, populism and laissez-faire. Lipset illustrated his point by recalling how the governments of Canada and the United States at virtually the same time announced that their nations would convert to the metric system. The Canadians, who tend to respect authority, soon complied. But the Americans? Individualist to their core, always less respecting of authority, thumbed their noses. As John Wayne might have said, we won this country inch by inch -- we weren't about to give it away kilometer by kilometer. Photos: Faces of citizenship . Whatever they think about exceptionalism, academics and politicians today tend to accept these five as core American values. Yet as Lipset and others have argued, these values can be in serious tension with each other. Those who believe foremost in egalitarianism, for example, run in very different directions from stout defenders of laissez-faire. In politics, nowhere does this tension between core values play out more starkly than in debates over liberty versus equality. Republicans have traditionally argued that a free society allows everyone to do better, while Democrats have objected that without basic fairness, society as a whole is held back. In that spirit, Romney ardently defends liberty and just as ardently, Obama defends social equity. On taxes, for example, Romney believes that affluent Americans have been taxed enough -- to do more would limit their freedom; Obama believes that they should pay more so that the playing field is more level. Similarly, Republicans attack Obamacare as an infringement upon liberty, while Democrats see it as necessary to extend a basic protection to all Americans. On this July Fourth, then, we have an America where many, including our leading politicians, disagree on what makes the country special -- and on what values should take precedence. There is nothing inherently wrong with such disagreements: Indeed, a competition of ideas is healthy for the republic. But, as has become painfully obvious, the differences in perspective have become so sharp and deep that we are tearing ourselves apart. That's why this July Fourth should not only be an occasion for wondering what makes America special, but also for pondering how we can build bridges across the divide. In the divide over liberty versus equality, there does seem one basic value that both sides hold in common: a belief in equality of opportunity -- that everyone in America should have a chance to succeed on his or her merits. Romney talks of ""rebuilding the foundation of an opportunity society,"" and it was Obama who first rocketed to national fame in 2004 by proclaiming that in no other country on Earth would his story have been possible: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."" That belief in the importance of equality of opportunity is widely held across the country, even as our politics appear ever more divided. For our money, the winner of the 2012 election won't be the one who makes a stronger argument for egalitarianism over liberty or liberty over egalitarianism, but the candidate who joins the two, persuading voters he is best equipped to lift floors as well as ceilings, ensuring every American has an honest shot in life. As for the debate over exceptionalism, the candidates ought to study that scene from ""The Newsroom."" While they will want to steer clear of petulance and sanctimony, surely there is much good to come from being straight with people (if perhaps a bit more optimistic). We have been special in history and we have also been different, but we have, in many respects, lost our way, and it is long past time to reclaim our souls.

"(CNN) -- Yet again we are struggling to bear the unbearable. How can we find meaning in the massacre of so many innocent children, savagely cut down in a hail of bullets? Abraham Lincoln is much on our minds these days and, fortunately, there is much his life teaches us about giving meaning to human horror. Eleven months from now, we will be celebrating the 150th anniversary of his journey to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he consecrated a national cemetery in honor of the thousands slaughtered in the Civil War battle there. In the most eloquent address in American history, Lincoln told us, ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to (their) great unfinished work."" In their honor, he concluded, ""we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom."" These were not idle words; he devoted himself to action. In the final months of his life, as the new film on Lincoln shows, he threw himself into the enactment of the 13th Amendment, outlawing slavery in the entire nation. After his death, the nation continued to act as he had asked, passing the 14th Amendment and quickening its progress toward realizing the dream of the Declaration: that all are created equal. The shootings in Connecticut are not Gettysburg, but surely the long, unending string of killings that we have endured must do more than touch our hearts. As Lincoln saw, we must find meaning in the madness of life -- and we do that by honoring the dead through action. The moment to act is now upon us, not to be lost as we rush headlong into the holiday season and more twists and turns ahead. We are better than that. There is a common thread running through most of the mass killings we have seen in recent years: A deranged gunman gets his hands on a gun, usually a semi-automatic, and rapidly cuts down innocents before anyone can stop him. Clearly, we must find better answers for the mentally unstable. We have the ability to recognize the characteristics of those more likely to commit such acts of violence, and we must do more to provide long-term treatment. But just as clearly, we need to change our culture of guns. There is something terribly wrong in a nation that has some 300 million guns floating around, easily accessible to the mentally ill. Of the 62 mass shootings in the U.S. over the past three decades, more than three-quarters of the guns used were obtained legally. Unless we act to change our laws as well as our culture, we will all be enablers when the next loner strikes. The blood will be on our hands, too. Experts can come up with precise policy prescriptions that will allow us to maintain the constitutional freedoms of the 2nd Amendment while also changing our gun culture. Contrary to what the National Rifle Association says, it is very possible to do both. What is needed immediately is a conversation determining what principles we want to establish -- and then action to realize them. From my perspective, there should be at least three basic principles: . FIRST: To own a gun, you must first have a license -- and it shouldn't be easy to get. The right parallel is to cars: Everyone over a prescribed age is entitled to drive. But cars are dangerous, so we first require a license -- determining that you are fit to drive. Citizens have a right to bear arms, but guns are dangerous, too. So, get a license. There are a number of issues with our current system of state-based permits. First, variation in gun regulations from state to state deeply complicates enforcement efforts. Arizona, for instance, allows concealed carry without any permit, while its neighbor California has implemented the strongest gun laws in the country. We must design a sensible federal gun control policy to address the current legal chaos. As we construct a federal licensing system, we should look to California. The state requires all gun sales to be processed through a licensed dealer, mandating background checks and a ten-day waiting period; bans most assault weapons and all large-capacity magazines; closes the nonsensical gun-show loophole; and maintains a permanent record of all sales. SECOND: If you are a civilian, you can't buy an assault gun. Hunters don't need military style weapons, nor do homeowners who want to be able to protect their families. They are far too popular among people who shouldn't have access to guns in the first place. We should restore the federal ban that has expired. THIRD: Parents should be heavily advised to keep guns out of their houses and out of the hands of kids.  No one wants to blame the poor mother of the Connecticut shooter, but everyone wonders why she kept so many military-style guns in the house, so accessible to her son. It's hard to believe, but roughly a third of households with children younger than 18 contain at least one gun. In too many neighborhoods in America -- not just in big cities -- parents who don't allow guns in their homes are apprehensive, even frightened, by their kids playing at homes where they are kept. Some years ago, no one thought that we could change our tobacco culture. We did. No one thought that we could reduce drunk driving by teenagers. We did -- thanks in large part to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Years from now, no one will note what we say after this latest massacre. But they will hold us morally accountable for what we do. To honor all of those who have been slain in recent years -- starting with the first-graders in Connecticut -- we should highly resolve to change our culture of guns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen says we should take a cue from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address .

"(CNN) -- Neither the State of the Union address by President Barack Obama nor the response by Sen. Marco Rubio will ever find a place in the anthology of best American speeches, but together they were important entries in the political dialogue. Before they fade into memory, perhaps a few words are in order about the highs and lows of the evening -- at least from this vantage point: . The most savored thought: Who could have imagined a decade ago hearing an African-American deliver the State of the Union and a Latino offering the opposition's response? No other advanced country in the world has so fully embraced diversity. Yes, it is true that in 2009 an Indian-American gave the response, but still the country has needed to have more Latinos advance into political leadership. To have Obama and Rubio speak back-to-back was special. The emotional highlight: After a rather pedestrian opening, the president's speech soared at the end as he called out the victims of gun violence and demanded a vote in their honor. It's hard to remember oratory that has worked so effectively in a State of the Union. Cody Keenan, please join the president in taking a bow. Keenan is the 32-year old who just became chief speechwriter at the White House. He has been known there in the past as the deputy who had the account for eulogies and commencements -- and in those closing moments, we saw that the president chose the right person to succeed the highly respected Jon Favreau. And yes, the victims deserve a vote! The biggest disappointment: For the president, this speech was probably his last opportunity to break open the impasse over federal deficits. Only a game-changing proposal had any chance of success -- putting a bold offer on the table of significant changes in Medicare and Social Security along with a tax overhaul in exchange for the GOP dropping the sequester and accepting near-term investments in infrastructure and the like. But the president never stepped up. Indeed, without admitting it, he is in retreat from the original Simpson-Bowles proposal to lower the national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product. That is a huge setback for the country. The most pleasant surprise: In days leading up to the address, White House aides had been dropping broad hints to the press that a newly combative Obama would once again stick it to Republicans. Not an olive branch, reported Politico, but a cattle prod. Instead, Obama wisely chose to use tempered, constructive language in addressing the other side. That didn't change the atmosphere much in Washington -- but give the president credit. He didn't make it worse either. It would be good to hear the Republicans act in the same spirit. The best idea: Among the many proposals Obama set forth, his argument that America should provide quality preschool for every child deserves special attention. Research shows that on average, a low-income child enters kindergarten with a much smaller vocabulary than a high-income child and will likely never make up the gap. Yet one wondered as the president spoke: Whatever happened to the promise that every child would also have quality K-12? The worst idea: It is one thing for the federal government to intervene in early public education because the system is so deeply in need of reform. But it is another thing entirely to follow the president's notion that the federal government should begin regulating colleges and universities to ensure they are providing good education at affordable prices. Yes, schools must keep tighter control over tuition increases and provide more online courses at cheaper prices, but the last thing we need is for Washington to inject itself deeply into higher education. America has the best colleges and universities in the world; they are a crown jewel. If they ain't broke, Washington shouldn't try to fix them. What was left out: Obama insisted that his many spending proposals wouldn't add a dime to the deficits. That was risible. Of course, they will cost lots of money -- he just forgot to tell us the price tags and how he would pay for them. Rubio wasn't much better: He said where Republicans wanted to go on issues, but he rarely told us how they would get there. For example, how exactly would they now overhaul Medicare? And both men ducked conversations about some of our deeper, underlying problems. Case in point: The United States is undergoing a dramatic shift in childbearing so that half the children born to mothers under 30 are born out of wedlock. We know as well that a child born out of wedlock is more likely to experience poverty and lack an adequate education. We don't need our political leaders to chastise single mothers -- they bear some of the toughest burdens in society -- but we do need our leaders to promote the values of marriage and to demand more responsible fatherhood. The president at least hinted at the problem, but neither man really wrestled with it. State of the Union addresses might have become boring for many, but they are important. Since Woodrow Wilson, they have been an annual ritual, giving the nation's most powerful elected leader an opportunity to tell Congress and the country what faces us and what we must do as a people. This year's address and its response seemed middling -- some great moments, some clunkers. Sadly, they didn't seem to move us forward. The State of the Union that does that is the one that will make the anthologies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen: Significant moment of diversity in President Obama, Sen. Rubio .
Gergen: Best of Obama was a call for gun control; the worst was failure to address deficit .
Neither one specified how his party would fund or handle certain issues, he says .

"(CNN) -- Pressure is mounting on Republicans to address spreading public protests against Wall Street. How they answer could shape the political landscape from here to the November elections. Republicans haven't had to pay much attention to Occupy Wall Street till now -- they could afford to sniff that the crowds in Zuccotti Park looked more like Woodstock than Wall Street. But as demonstrations have sprung up across the U.S. and Europe, reverberating through social media and gaining more serious attention from mainstream media, politicians must pay more attention. President Obama and fellow Democrats have already leapt to the support of protesters. The cries of frustration and anger from the streets dovetail perfectly with the president's own shift leftward, populist stance, efforts to blame the rich for America's economic woes, and demands that they pay higher taxes. So perfect is the fit that some conservatives suspect that Democratic partisans are quietly fueling the protests. There are legitimate questions as to whether the president is ill serving the national interest by whipping up antagonism toward the wealthy, especially the financial services industry. Until recently, many influential Democrats (such as Sen. Chuck Schumer) joined Republicans in believing that Wall Street, serving as the financial capital of the world, was one of the nation's top assets. Yes, it became too greedy and reckless and needed tougher government scrutiny, but its vitality should be preserved. Soon after taking office, Obama summoned bankers and told them he was all that was standing between them and people with pitchforks. Today, many in New York believe the president has now taken up a pitchfork himself. What impact this alienation will have on voting behavior remains uncertain, but clearly, the president and his team believe it will help them in 2012. What better way to change the storyline for the elections? Wall Street demonstrations start second month . That raises the question: How will Republicans rise to the challenge? How will they frame the argument about the protesters and their underlying issues? Some in the GOP hope the protesters will disappear with the first frost, taking the controversy with them. Perhaps that will happen: They are not as well-organized nor do they have as clear an agenda as the tea partiers, so they may not be able to sustain themselves. Even if the protesters melt away, however, it appears they have already achieved an important goal: They have put income inequality on the national agenda. Yawning gaps between the top 1% versus the other 99% have been simmering as a political issue for a long time, stretching back before the Great Recession. But most middle-class Americans haven't seriously objected, whether because their sense of their current income was skewed, or because they expected they'd strike it rich one day themselves. (One poll from 2000 showed that no less than 19% considered themselves in the top 1% -- and another 20% on top of that expected they would be soon.) All that has changed now. Most Americans feel stuck, they think their kids will be worse off than they are, and they are increasingly angry. A Time magazine poll this week found that by 54% to 23%, the public approves of protests on Wall Street and beyond; by contrast, opinion about the tea party now runs 33% negative versus 27% positive. So the GOP likely can't duck addressing inequality. Newt Gingrich last week voiced sympathy for those protesting who are truly suffering. But one would think that GOP candidates would go well beyond and frankly recognize, as Alan Greenspan and some other Republicans have, that massive inequality and a lack of upward mobility are destructive to a democracy. Perhaps they don't agree, but if so, they are living in a darker past than we all thought. The evidence of yawning inequalities is now plentiful. Here are just a few factoids: . -- Between 1977 and 2007, the top 1% earners' share of national income jumped from roughly 9% to 23.5%, a level only bested once in our history -- in 1928. -- The CEO-to-worker pay ratio has also skyrocketed: At the start of the 1980s, CEOs made roughly 40 times as much as bottom-rung workers; by 2010, they took home between 300 and 400 times as much. -- The divergence is even greater among the super-rich: The top 0.1% (roughly 150,000 families) now make roughly 10% of the nation's total income -- so they're pulling away even from the rest of the rich themselves. These stats are jarring, but they're not enough. If poor Americans had a nickel for every statistic that's been trotted out to diagnose the issue in the past year, we wouldn't have to worry about income inequality anymore. The hard question -- now put to the Republican free marketers, who have owned the political dialogue of late -- is what to do to narrow the inequality gap. Presumably -- and this is a logical position -- Republican candidates would oppose lowering the ceiling on the rich, preferring to lift the floor for everyone else. But that is easier said than done. First of all, even our most optimistic economists are not projecting anything above fairly modest growth over the next few years -- no game changers there. But moreover, to fall back on the single mantra of more growth as the elixir simply doesn't hack it anymore: In the new normal, a rising tide doesn't lift all boats. With massive structural changes like globalization and technology reorienting the economy, many -- particularly in rich, developed countries like our own -- find themselves mired in the mud, while others have super-duper motors that let them run off into the sunset. So, what's a good Republican to do to lift floors? Heaven forbid, some forms of government intervention may actually be necessary. That's, at least, what Ronald Reagan concluded. He became a champion of an earned income tax credit, helping to raise the income of people willing to work for meager wages. Bill Clinton expanded the Reagan program and it proved a powerful tool in closing the inequality gap in the mid-90s. If Reagan and Clinton could agree on a successful tactic to help more families enter the middle class, can't today's Republicans come up with imaginative new approaches? The issue, as most of us agree, is not really inequality so much as it is mobility, or opportunity. The vast majority of Americans -- and the presidential hopefuls on stage are certainly among them -- don't want to live in a society where everyone is held equally low; they want to live in a society where everyone has a fair opportunity to climb high. That's a moral issue as much as economic one, and our political leaders are ultimately judged not just by the way they lift the GDP, but by the way they lift the moral life of their country. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: GOP has ignored Occupy Wall St so far, but it has to tackle those issues .

"(CNN) -- The great irony of the government spying controversy is that even America's state-of-the-art spy agency could not keep secret the fact that it might be spying on our secrets. Nobody's secrets are safe. Not spies, not corporations, and certainly not the rest of us regular people, with our clever little passwords, our privacy settings and our restricted friends' lists. The danger is not just from government intelligence agents using sophisticated computer algorithms. Our privacy is vulnerable on many fronts. A 29-year-old technician can personally decide to reveal the existence of Prism, a surveillance program that James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, says has brought ""among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence"" the United States has gathered and its release will cause ""long-lasting and irreversible harm"" to U.S. security. When the government is the one doing the snooping, as Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor accuses the NSA of doing, it raises unique issues. America was founded on ideals that emphasized restraining the power of government and empowering the individual. Opinion: Massive spying on Americans is outrageous . If the government is indeed engaging in wholesale spying with practically no restrictions on what it can record and read -- something President Obama denies -- this is an affront to the constitution, and it demands action from Congress. And the breach of government secrets demands attention as well. But there is more. If we pull the thread on Snowden's allegations we may just find details of our own lives unspooling. Everything about us is online, waiting for a corporation or a hacker or a spy to reveal it. Snowden claims that the NSA and the FBI have direct access to the servers of the biggest Internet service providers in the world, as well as the biggest social media companies and the most popular search engines, mapping applications, and Internet telephony firms. Opinion: Why we need government surveillance . The companies all deny this. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, AOL, Skype, YouTube, Apple, and PalTalk -- all say the government has no direct access. Before we find out where the truth lies, we should pause to consider what exactly those companies' servers contain, because that information exists, whether the government looks at it or not. It is detailed information about everyone who uses the Internet. Think about this: If the NSA could not safeguard its information, how do we expect anyone to do it? What kind of information are we talking about? Let's review, from those ""privacy policies"" we always approve without reading because the alternative has become too burdensome. Yes, the companies provide enormously valuable products and -- in theory -- we have the option of not using them. Google's servers store much more than your Gmail e-mails. They contain the words you have looked up, the illnesses you have tried to learn about. It knows what high school sweetheart you've tracked down, it knows what pictures you've looked at online. It knows what phone calls you've made on Google Voice, and it knows where you have been when you made searches, over which cell tower or Wi-Fi network. Facebook admits that even after we delete material from our page, it is not permanently deleted from its servers unless we delete the entire account. Opinion: Edward Snowden is a hero . Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, famously said, ""If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."" But that dismissive attitude assumes that if you want privacy you must have done something wrong, which is patently incorrect. It disregards the idea that we have a right to not have parts of our lives exposed without our consent. Some argue the loss of privacy is ""the cost of admission"" to our new world, and see no problem with that. But the problems will come. There will be misunderstandings, insinuations and accusations. We won't be there to explain why we looked something up. Why we talked to a certain person. Why we went somewhere. Jobs will be lost, relationships damaged, lives destroyed. Will these firms sell our information? Of course. Will they give it to the government? Google's Schmidt said yes, ""It is possible that the information could be made available to authorities."" The important part to remember is that what we do online, what we post, what we search, what we store, what we write, what we put into words or pictures, is not protected, not even if its corporate guardians promise they will keep it safe. If someone in Hawaii can decide to reveal government secrets, it means another government contractor at the NSA or the CIA or the FBI, or an employee at Google or Microsoft or Facebook, or a hacker in China or California, could get his or her hands on the digital threads of our lives and make them public for fun or for profit. In the old days of the Soviet KGB, people would go to places like Moscow's Gorky Park if they wanted a private conversation. There is no Gorky Park online. We may need to revert to face-to-face meetings for assured privacy, but that is simply not practical in today's world. The debate over NSA surveillance should extend to other areas of privacy. It's time Internet companies stopped holding on to our information without much more explicit permission. Much more should be discarded without discussion. But even if progress is made in this area, we must know that we have entered a new age of greatly diminished control over our personal information. The NSA is no doubt enduring what countless victims of hackings have experienced, frantically trying to fix and explain and prevent more damage from the unwanted exposure. The data hunter has fallen prey. Nobody is safe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis says it's noteworthy that even the NSA couldn't keep its secrets secret .
Passwords, privacy settings and restricted friends' lists won't protect our secrets either, she says .
Ghitis: Everything about us is online, waiting for someone to reveal it .
Eric Schmidt is wrong to say you shouldn't do anything you don't want world to know, she says ."
