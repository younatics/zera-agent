A man whose wheelchair-bound, morbidly obese wife died last year after she was denied a spot on three different flights home from Europe has sued the airlines for $6 million. Vilma Soltesz, who at the time was reported to have weighed 425 pounds (193 kg), had an amputated leg and suffered from diabetes and kidney disease. She was found dead at her vacation home in Hungary in October after several aircraft crews repeatedly failed to accommodate her size despite telling her they could do so, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan. Scroll down for video . Stranded: Vilma Soltesz, 56, from New York, died while on holiday in Hungary in October because she was told she could not board three separate flights . The lawsuit accused the three airlines of wrongful death and gross negligence. The couple left their Bronx home in . September on a Delta Air Lines plane, securing two seats for Vilma and . one for her husband Janos, and arrived safely in Budapest on a vacation, . according to the lawsuit. By October 2, Vilma Soltesz sought . treatment at a hospital in Hungary when she fell ill, according to the . lawsuit. She was released and told she could fly home but to see her . doctor immediately upon her arrival, according to the lawsuit. The pair tried to leave Budapest two . weeks later on a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight, with accommodations . similar to what they received on their flight from the United States, . according to the suit. Struggle: In Prague although a local fire department were brought into . to help move Mrs Soltesz into three seats assigned to her, they could not . lift her out of the wheelchair . But a captain told them to disembark . after Vilma Soltesz struggled to maneuver from her wheelchair into her . assigned seats, the lawsuit says. After waiting in a Budapest airport . for more than five hours, the couple drove to Prague to catch a Delta . flight they were assured could accommodate them. But Delta did not have . an adequate wheelchair to transport Vilma Soltesz to her seat, the suit . added. 'The Delta flight coordinator told . Janos and Vilma that Delta ''did not have access to a skylift'' to get . Vilma onto the aircraft from the rear, and that there was nothing more . Delta could do for them,' the lawsuit stated. Predicament: Mrs Soltesz had gained weight due to her illness and the airline said it did not have a seat-belt extender for her according to her husband . Later, on October 22, as several . medics and firefighters helped her board a Lufthansa flight, the captain . told the couple they had to disembark because 'other passengers need to . catch a connecting flight and cannot be delayed further,' the lawsuit . says. 'Exhausted and feeling ill,' Vilma . Soltesz went to bed after the couple drove back to their vacation home . in Veszprem, Hungary, the lawsuit says. On October 24, Janos found her dead. A Delta Air Lines spokesman said the . airline had not been served with the lawsuit. Officials with Royal Dutch . Airlines and Lufthansa did not immediately respond to a request for . comment. An attorney for Mr Soltesz did not immediately return a call . seeking comment.

Sports fans will be able to pay a £9.99 rate to watch Premier League football, the first time games have been made available to non-Sky subscribers. BSkyB's deal will allow unlimited 24-hour access online via the NOW TV website to its six Sky Sports channels. It is a radical change for the company, . part owned by Rupert Murdoch, as they have spent 20 years trying to tie . people to packages costing in excess of £42.50 a month for Sky Sports. The turnaround will be a godsend to people who only watch the occasional big match, can't make it to the pub or are stuck in an office with no TVs while a game featuring their team in taking place. Deal: Manchester United's Wayne Rooney scores against Southampton in the Premier League last night, and BSkyB has announced today it will allow people to watch Sky Sports for £9.99 a day online . The concept will allow anyone the chance to watch Premier League football matches from this spring. It will also include the Ryder Cup, The Ashes and Formula One races. On weekends, when up to half a dozen live football matches from England, Scotland and Spain are shown, £9.99 could work out at less than £1.50 per match. However, initial reaction online appears to be lukewarm. Offer: Sports addicts will be able to watch channels like Sky Sports News, presented by Hayley McQueen, for the first time with a daily rate . On Twitter @ribs909 said: '£9.99 a week would be more realistic', while @baggers1967 said: 'be surprised if there is a big take up at that price. Wouldn't a more realistic price be about £4 per day? Another tweeter @matmurray wrote: 'Well it's massive as it's the first PPV (pay-per-view) on-demand Premiership football, but yeah, the price is a total joke.' Its NOW TV website already offers online access . to Sky Movies to compete with rivals LoveFilm and . Netflix. A promotion campaign prompted some 25,000 . customers to sign up to NOW TV in the last three months of 2012, according to . BSkyB. Sky has more than 10million subscribers, half of which subscribe to their HD service. However, the company almost went bust in the early 1990s after a battle with other satellite TV companies. But it was Sky's decision to buy the rights to show Premier League football from 1992 that helped save the business. Today the satellite broadcaster reported an eight per cent rise in operating profits to £647million in the six months to December 31. Revenues at the group were up 5 per cent to £3.5billion. Premium coverage: BSkyB plans to boost the NOW TV website by offering 24-hour sport passes . Departure: For 20 years BSkyB has worked on a subscription-basis for its channels but this will change from this spring . Sky said price hikes, including a rise of £1 for its Sky Sports package and £1.50 for its Sky entertainment package, had helped drive the revenue growth. Dundee United v Rangers                  12.45pm  Scottish Cup . QPR v Norwich                                    12.45pm Premier League . Crawley Town v Swindon Town          5.20pm  League One .

It gained 80,000 new customers in that period, up from the 48,000 in the previous quarter to reach a total of 10.74million. Average revenues per user rose by £24 on a year earlier to £568. The group also added 132,000 new broadband customers, including 38,000 new standalone customers in the period. The group reported a standout performance from its Sky Sports channel, with record audiences when Europe beat the US in the Ryder Cup and Andy Murray won his first grand slam in the US Open. It also attracted 9million viewers to its first season of Sky Sports Formula One channel. Its Sky Sports on Sky Go service, where users can watch television on their mobile phones and tablet computers, registered a record 234,000 unique users for live coverage of the Manchester derby in December.

The elderly cat's owner contacted emergency services, who were forced to call for back-up and an extra-long ladder to save the petrified pet. Stranded: Emergency services were called after Tigger was spotted 40ft in the air above North Street Tavern . Scaredy-cat: The petrified pet was stuck on the post until a fireman climbed a ladder and gently lifted her down . Concern: A crowd gathers as at least five firefighters arrive with a truck and equipment to help the animal . Within ten minutes of the call, a fireman had climbed the ladder, gathered the cat tenderly into his arms and returned her to her owner. She had been up there for more than an hour in total. Tigger was first spotted perching on top of the pole in Sudbury town centre, Suffolk. A crowd of concerned shoppers gathered outside North Street Tavern to watch the rescue. Witness Roger Griffiths, who photographed the episode, said: 'The poor little thing was up incredibly high. Paw thing!

The U.S Government has issued a controversial video telling office workers what to do should a crazed gunman storms their building. Issued by Homeland Security, the video, called Active Shooter Situation: Options for Consideration, tells workers to flee if it is safe or find a hiding place if trapped should a gunman storm the building. The video even advises using scissors as a weapon to defend yourself if your are caught in the open. The four minute clip begins with chilling images of some of . the most deadly public shootings in recent U.S history including the . 2007 Virginia Tech massacre which saw 32 people shot dead, the 2009 mass . shooting at Fort Hood in Texas and the attempted assassination of . former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011. Scroll down for video . Advice: The video has been released as part of Barack Obama's bid to drive down gun related crime in the U.S . Hide: The video shows office workers scrambling for hiding places while a crazed gunman stalks the building . Take cover: The video recommends staying out of the line of fire . Out of sight: A woman is seen hiding behind a chair and an office bin in a bid to keep out of the shooter's eye line . It then gives a range of advice telling people to 'identify escape routes' from their building, to 'have a plan in mind' and to 'obey instructions'. The video shows actors playing office workers, fleeing a building, hiding under desks and barricading themselves in darkened rooms. As well as offering practical such as keeping quiet, switching mobile phones to silent and taking cover out of the line of fire, the clip also shows a worker grabbing a pair of scissors and brandishing them like a weapon. The scene is accompanied by advice from the narrator who warns: 'If you are caught out in the open and cannot conceal yourself or take cover, you might consider trying to overpower the shooter with whatever means are available.' Plan ahead: The video warns workers to identify escape routes from their building . Be prepared: According to Homeland Security it is best to have a plan in mind should a gunman attack . Hide: Workers sitting around a meeting table learn that there is a gunman in the building and leap up from their seats . Safety: The workers hide under the meeting table . Get out: The video recommends fleeing the building if it is safe to do so . Safety first: A Homeland Security clip suggests arming yourself with a pair of scissors if a crazed gunman attacks your workplace . The narrator sagely suggests locking the door of your hiding place or blocking the door with heavy furniture. The advice is to only call 911 when it's safe to do so and to tell the operator your location, the number of shooters, details of the shooter's weapons, and the number of potential victims. He also suggests obeying police orders when tactical teams arrive at the scene, telling workers to keep their hands visible, make no sudden movements, to avoid pointing and not to scream or yell. The video has been released as part of an ongoing attempt by President Barack Obama's administration to drive down gun-related violence in the wake of last month's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Connecticut, which saw 26 children and teachers shot dead. The 'Options for Consideration' video was already in production before that incident and Homeland Security has been running a programme to prepare people for a shooting incident. Dial for help: The video suggests waiting until it is safe to call police . Help others: Stopping others from entering a dangerous building is key to surviving a shooter situation, say Homeland Security . The advice to arm yourself with scissors may seem bizarre, but security consultant Andrew Scott told the New York Post that the information in the video is 'adequate'. He conceded that Homeland Security was correct in recommending that people use scissors to attack a gunman but only in a 'last, worst-case scenario.' 'Just the suggestion [to fight back] is a positive move,” said Scott, a former SWAT commander in North Miami Beach. 'You don’t want to be sheep for the slaughter.' President Obama has pledged a ban on . military-type assault rifles and high capacity ammunition clips as well . as more stringent background checks on anyone wishing to buy a gun. The proposals have proved controversial. Listen: The video warns people to obey the instructions of police officers when they arrive on the scene and not to stop to ask officers questions .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 07:40 EST, 31 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:43 EST, 31 January 2013 . Two brothers who masterminded a £244,000 fraud from their council house bedroom have been jailed for a total of 10 years. Shilu Miah, 31, and his sibling Dulu Miah, 26, used confidential information passed on from a bank 'insider' to steal elderly and vulnerable people's life savings from 218 accounts. The criminals spent most of the cash from the 12-month scam on luxury holidays, cars and designer clothes, including Louis Vuitton flip flops ' to the tune of £1,000 a pair', Blackfriars Crown Court heard. The brothers also went on shopping sprees at Selfridges and Harrods as well as drinking champagne at nightclubs in London's West End. Con artists: Brothers Dulu Miah (left) Shilu Miah (righted) grabbed £244,000 in a fraud that raided the accounts of hundreds of vulnerable and elderly people . Victims had been conned after the fraudsters telephoned them pretending to be from their bank. After speaking on the phone and getting vital details such as a pin number, a taxi was sent to the victim’s house to pick up the bank card and deliver it to the gang. As well as dressing in Ralph Lauren clothes , Dulu Miah enjoyed two sunshine trips to Miami at his victims' expense, booking an ocean-room at the Ritz Carlton on one of his lavish breaks. Judge Aidan Marron, QC, said the brothers had not shown a 'morsel of remorse' as he jailed them. The judge said they had resorted to making 'sinister threats' to persuade their elderly victims, aged in their 80s and 90s, from Camden, north London, to hand over bank cards and details. Judge Marron told them: 'You clearly had some access to private and confidential bank information, because the information with which you were armed to incite this conspiracy could only have come from the confidential files in a bank. 'The conspiracy lasted for about 12 months, involving about 220 different cases and the loss in the region of a quarter of a million pounds was occasioned.' Taken back: Shilu Miah's flash blue BMW is seized by police after they smashed their racket . Spending: The Miah brother splurged their cash on these designer goods and perfumes recovered from the bedroom they shared in a London council house . Spending: One of the men bought a pair of Louis Vuitton flip-flops like these, 'to the tune of £1,000', the court heard . They used their parents' council home in King's Cross as the nerve centre of their fraud. Shilu Miah even set up a bogus 0845 number at their house from which at least 218 victims were called by men posing as bank staff. The targets were conned into handing over vital details such as PIN numbers to the fraudsters. A taxi was then sent to the victims' homes to pick up the card and deliver it to the gang. The cards were then used to either siphon cash out of the person's account or open up a loan. Police launched a string of raids on July 5 last year to smash the complex crime ring after carrying out a huge investigation. Misdeed: Dulu Miah also enjoyed two sunshine trips to Miami at his victims' expense, booking an ocean-room at the Ritz Carlton (pictured) Detectives found confidential bank documents stashed behind the steering wheel of a flash £7,500 BMW belonging to former bus driver Shilu. The complex fraud of the type carried out by the Miah brothers has been troubling police for some time. Conmen posing as bank staff, fraud investigators or even police telephone their elderly and vulnerable targets, convince them that their bank accounts have been compromised and persuade, and sometimes threaten, the victims into handing over sensitive information such as their PIN. A courier, often an unwitting minicab driver, is sent round to the victims address to collect the card before the fraudsters plunder the target's bank accounts for thousands of pounds. More than 100 people in Camden, London, have been stung so far to the tune of £1million and the fraud is still continuing. A Hampstead actor and Primrose Hill artist's bank accounts have been raided and former MEP William Hopper had £1,000 stolen from his account late last year. Cops also seized expensive Louis Vuitton, Ralph Lauren and Gucci designer clothes, an enormous hoard of perfume and electrical goods in the brothers' shared bedroom, along with £14,000 in Shilu's safe. Shilu Miah, who was jailed for manslaughter in 2002, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud and convicted of being in possession of criminal property after a week-long trial. He was jailed for six years. His younger brother Dulu was jailed for four years and three months after he admitted one count of conspiracy to commit fraud. The scam, known as 'courier fraud', is still rife in Camden, with more than 100  cases reported to police every week. Det Ch Supt Richard Tucker, based in Camden, said after the brothers were jailed: 'These men committed a calculated and ruthless series of frauds to fund their lavish lifestyle. 'They had absolutely no regard for their victims, demonstrated by the fact that they not only took their victims' lifesavings without batting an eyelid but then even taunted and verbally abused some of them. 'These sentences reflect the importance we, the police, and the criminal justice system attach to this cold-hearted crime, and our determination to bring the callous perpetrators to account. 'I urge the public to remember this simple rule ""the banks and the police will never ask for your PIN or bank card, so do not give it to them.' Det Insp Paul Whatmore, of Scotland Yard's Fraud Squad, said: 'This is a great result for the Camden officers who were quite rightly commended for their work by the trial judge. 'Hopefully, these are just the first of many such results as we seek to curb this truly distasteful crime.'

Fed-up: Husband Stephen Hirst, 53, gave his double amputee wife a potentially lethal dose of morphine to 'shut her up' because he wanted some 'peace and quiet' A fed-up husband gave his double amputee wife a potentially lethal dose of morphine to 'shut her up' because he wanted some 'peace and quiet'. Stephen Hirst, 52, tricked his disabled wife Catherine, 43, into taking six times her normal dose of medication because he could not cope with their constant arguments. Mrs Hirst, who is confined to a wheelchair, needs to take two 10 milligrams morphine tablets every morning. But on September 30 last year her husband swapped her medication for 60 milligram pills - and she swallowed both as usual. The effect of the massive dose knocked Mrs Hirst out for the entire day. Hirst, of Exeter, Devon, admitted unlawfully administering a drug intending to 'aggrieve' his wife and was jailed for 13 months at Exeter Crown Court. Judge Phillip . Wassall told him: 'You deliberately administered a toxic substance which . is a class A drug and that is an aggravating feature. 'We are dealing with the administration of a toxic substance which . carried a risk. You used it simply to shut her up so you could have some . peace and quiet, so it is a serious offence.' After Mrs Hirst woke up she called NHS Direct for advice and paramedics were sent to check on her but medics ruled out any lasting damage and urged her to call the police. Mr David Bowen, prosecuting, said Hirst had been married to his wife . for about five years and he was her full time carer, helping her cope . with the effects of losing both legs. He said: 'She woke up on September 30 and took her tablets which she thought were two 10 mg doses of morphine sulphate. 'The defendant had substituted the 10 mg tablets for 60 mg ones, so she . took a dose of 120 mg instead of the intended 20 mg. She started to feel . unwell. 'She challenged her husband about the over dosage and he admitted what he had done but could not give her a reason. Worried: After Mrs Hirst woke up she called NHS Direct for advice and paramedics were sent to check on her . 'She was so unwell she phoned NHS Direct and they called the police. He . was asked if he had tried to kill her and said no and said she had been . in a lot of pain. 'He admitted what he had done to police and said he required respite . from his caring duties. The victim suffered no long term effects.' Mr David Evans, defending, said Hirst was struggling to cope with his . duties as carer and gave her the drugs to give himself a break from . their constant arguments. He said: 'She had in the preceding months withdrawn from him . emotionally, conversationally and sexually. There were many arguments . between them which could be very wearing for both of them. 'Utterly foolishly, on the Saturday night he changed her medication and . gave her the higher dose hoping to put her to sleep for longer than . usual and some respite. He did not think it through very clearly. 'She spent most of the following day sleeping and the following day rang . NHS Direct to ask if it was safe to take her usual dose. They called . paramedics and the police. 'He apologised to her and admitted what he had done. He was aware he had . done wrong. It has led to the end of his marriage. The divorce is . proceeding and he is living with his 87-year-old mother in Leeds.' Hirst was cleared of a more serious charge of unlawfully administering a drug intending to 'endanger' her life. Speaking from the home they shared in Exeter his wife said she did not want to talk about the case. Hirst was also given another month in prison to run concurrently after police found level one child porn images on a computer at his home.","Stephen Hirst tricked his disabled .

Clinging to hope: After Mary Gundrum learned last Feb. that the condition might be fatal for the child, her other children began praying that Dominic would survive . Doctors prepared the parents that the child would likely not . survive the extremely rare condition, only found in an estimated one child . every two to five years born in the U.S. It was expected that Mary could carry . the baby to term and that he would be born alive but would likely die within . hours. 'At first we were told he would probably die within a few . hours and that we should do our best to enjoy the pregnancy,' Mark Gundrum said. 'Over time his prognosis got better, and the doctors agreed . he'd survive birth. But after that, they had no idea what may happen to him. It . was a real no man’s land territory for all of us.' The Gundrums, who are strong . Catholics, leaned on their faith and spiritual . community as they tried to wrap their heads around what was happening. They shared . with their seven children that the baby would likely not live and while . the baby grew in Mary's womb, she wrestled with the tragedy that likely . lay before her. Family: The seven Gundrum children have welcomed their baby brother with open arms . Faith: The Gundrums leaned on their faith and the support of their spiritual community . Love: Dominic's older siblings having fun with their younger brother . Digesting the pain, shock and disappointment, Mary poured out her heart about . the emotional roller-coaster ride she experienced in a series of heart . wrenching journal entries, weaving in scripture as she worked through her . emotions. 'My hope is that people will not feel sorry for us, but please join us in . our hopefulness. Please join us in hoping and praying for God's will to be . done in us and Dominic … Of course please pray for us for the grace to trust,' the then-pregnant mother asked her readers shortly after she learned of the baby's condition. In the course of the pregnancy, after a discouraging medical appointment, the mother clung to hope and wrote, 'Today . my heart says, yes, I believe in miracles! I believe, if we pray, miracles will . come out of Dominic's short life. I believe God has a miracle in store, what . exactly that will be, I do not need to know.' With the devastating prognosis, the family waited out the pregnancy and faced an uncertain future. Then Mary gave birth via C-section on June 18 and Dominic Pio weighed 7 lbs, 8 . ounces and measured 20 1/2 inches long. He . lived longer than a few hours and overwhelmed his parents and the medical . team as he began developing normally, despite the prominent bubble on . his face. Miracle: Dominic Pio stunned doctors with his miraculous survival . Growing: Dominic began developing normally after his birth . Touching: Dominic's big sister snuggles the little miracle . ‘Things with Dominic are going so much better than what they could have, we . rejoice at every little victory!’ the family shared with their friends after . Dominic survived the delivery. In the months following Dominic’s birth, the parents were directed to Dr. John Meara, plastic surgeon-in-chief at . the Boston Children’s Hospital, who advised them to come to Boston so Dominic could undergo facial reconstruction surgery. Dr Meara and a team of brain specialists worked for weeks to run through . scenarios and prepare for possible complications in the lead to the December operation. They feared . the blood loss during the procedure would be too much for Dominic’s tiny body in addition to the possibility . of an infection but after weeks of preparation, felt confident at the prospects of a successful outcome. Joy: The Gundrums said they fell in love with Dominic's face and had to adjust to his new look after his surgery . Then on December 18, a team of 15 doctors gathered in an operating room at . 9:30am to remove the brain tissue and fluid that had pooled inside Dominic’s . encephalocele. With the sac removed from his face, Dr Meara then performed . reconstructive surgery on the baby’s face to repair the clef and align the . skull. The procedure ended at 3:30pm. The surgery ended up going more smoothly than expected and Dominic spent the next three weeks in ICU recovering. 'Everything went according to plan thanks to the amazing efforts of the whole team,' Dr Meara said. The Gundrums said they owe so much to the efforts Dr Meara, who was optimistic about Dominic's condition when no one else was. Doctor: Dr Meara with his little patient after the surgery . 'This doctor believed in Dominic's life as being valuable and worth all that went into saving him,' Mary wrote in thanks. 'This doctor made it possible for us to come out for a second opinion . and then he made it possible with insurance for Dominic's surgery to be . covered.' With his condition stabilized after three weeks, the parents returned to Wisconsin. As the family and their church continue to pray, they are thanking God for the miracle that is unfolding in Dominic. 'The day Dominic was born, a group of friends had a tree planted in our yard in his honor,' Mark said. 'I remember thinking, 10 years from now, I’m either going to look at that tree and think of the son I lost, or watch him climb its branches. Right now, thanks to so many wonderful people at Boston Children’s and beyond, I'm excited to watch him hanging from that tree as they both grow bigger and stronger.'","During routine ultrasound Mark and Mary Gundrum discovered the baby she was pregnant with had a sac of brain tissue growing outside his skull .

The huge burial site is believed to hold the remains of more than 40 babies who were stillborn in the 1950s. It was discovered covered with bracken and branches in an area of Ford Park Cemetery in Plymouth, Devon - which is now preserved as a nature reserve. Wendy Sophola has discovered a forgotten 'mass grave' thought to contain the bodies of dozens of babies in a Plymouth cemetery. Mrs Sophola, is pictured with her sister Mary's birth certificate, who died within hours of being born . Wendy Sophola discovered the burial site while searching for information about her sister Mary, who was born on January 1, 1955, and died just a few hours later. She obtained documents from the cemetery showing the bodies of 41 babies are contained in an overgrown plot of land at the north end of the site. Mrs Sophola, 55, said: 'It's so sad. There must be lots of parents still alive whose babies are in there. 'There might be a mother hearing this and thinking, 'I had a baby in that year, I never knew that happened'. 'I have asked questions like 'how are they presented? Are they side by side or what? Were they in little coffins, or were they just wrapped in muslin? 'The cemetery staff said they are not quite sure but there are some on top of each other. I just said ""Oh my God.""  It's disturbing. There is no respect for the dead.' Mrs Sophola, of Plymouth, grew up knowing she had a sister called Mary, who had died shortly after birth . Until last month, she had had no other information, until her father revealed that Mary had been buried in Ford Park Cemetery. Staff at the cemetery looked at old records and pointed Mrs Sophola towards a corner of the 34-acre site where her sister was supposedly buried. But she found the whole plot was overgrown with brambles and branches and she was not able to access Mary's grave. The cemetery opened in 1848 and was run by the Plymouth, Stonehouse and Devonport Cemetery Company until 1999. One of three plots where Wendy Sophola's sister could be buried, in Ford Park Cemetery Plymouth . When the company went into liquidation the Ford Park Cemetery Trust was formed to manage the site. The stillborn babies were laid to rest between January and December 1954 after being born at two of the city's hospitals except one who was apparently born at home. Trust chairman John Boon said: 'There are a number of graves in that area that the previous company used to bury babies who were stillborn or suffered neonatal death. 'They dealt with it in a different way to how we would probably do it these days, there is a greater awareness now.' Mr Boon said the area Mrs Sophola was asking about has been maintained as a wildlife reserve, but said he would possibly allow her to cut the area back. He said: 'I don't think this is any different to what other cemeteries do in terms of attitudes towards the burial of babies. 'All cemeteries back in that day did the same sort of thing. It was just a question of attitudes towards things in that day. 'We now have a dedicated area for the burial of babies where parents can buy freehold graves.'","Burial site is believed to hold the remains of more than 40 babies who were stillborn in the 1950s .

A Muslim family have fled their home after a cross wrapped in ham was left on their doorstep. The shocking incident took place in the normally sedate market town of Bingham, Notts, recently named eighth in a survey of the best places in England to raise children. Murad Alam, 39, said he had been forced to move his wife and two sons, aged eight and 10, to a 'safer' area. Nasty: Racist graffiti was scrawled on the driveway and locals screamed abuse at the children in the street . The family said they were the target of more racial abuse after the cross was left outside their suburban home last December, despite calling in the police. Racist graffiti was scrawled on their driveway and locals screamed insults at the children in the street. Consumption of pork and ham or any 'flesh of swine' is forbidden by Islam. In the wake of the intimidation, Mr Alam said he found his young son plotting escape routes from the house and neighbourhood on his computer. Mr Alam said: 'My wife and children also had names called at them in the street. 'The first incident was when the big, wooden cross, wrapped in ham, fell into the house after a knock at the door.' He said they had names such as 'Paki' and 'tramp' shouted at them in the street. Mr Alam said his wife and children, who he did not want to be named, had been left 'terrified' by the attacks. He said: 'The kids have been abused a number of times; the eldest had smoke blown in his face by an elderly local gentleman. 'It really annoys me that they should use a cross and try and turn this into a religious argument. 'My family were terrified from the very first incident; my wife had never experienced racism, neither had my kids. 'In fact I had to explain to my children what racism even was, because they're so young they didn't understand the concept that someone could dislike you because of your skin colour or religion.' The family has now moved to nearby West Bridgford, a suburb of Nottingham, where they say they feel safe. Mr Alam said Bingham was generally a pleasant place with a good reputation and it was a shame it had been tarred by their experiences. Despite being rated in the top-ten places to raise children by finance firm Family Investments, Mr Alam said there were some who spoiled it. 'The week before we moved there, Bingham was named the eighth best place to live in the UK - but that's if you're white - there are not many Asian or black faces there. 'It is a nice, generally middle-class village and I'm sure most of the people there are great, it's just these choice few.' Nottinghamshire Police said a 13-year-old boy had been arrested in connection with the attacks but he was later released without charge. Mr Alam said he had nothing but gratitude for the police involved in his family's case. He added: 'Nottinghamshire Police fitted secret cameras, security lighting and after the graffiti, they were literally parked at the end of the alley for days, 24/7. 'It's just a shame that no-one has come forward to name the people who are behind it.' Fiyaz Mughal, director of Tell Mama, a national service that records and analyses anti-Muslim attacks, said: 'This is one of a number of cases that we have seen where the anti-Muslim prejudice has had a shocking impact on the wider family. 'We provided practical support to the family where we could.

Brian Fraser leaves Maidstone Crown Court where he faces charges relating to the attempted murder of his former girlfriend Louise Leggatt . A marrried master of fox hounds shot his ex-lover after she rejected his bid to rekindle their romance, a court heard yesterday. Brian Fraser is accused of attempting to murder showjumper Louise Leggatt ‘in a fit of pique’ after she declined to  let him watch a horse race with her on television at her house. Days later, Miss Leggatt, 54, was blasted by a shotgun as she went to tend to her horses. Two months earlier, an arson attack had gutted her detached home in the exclusive Kent village of Benenden, forcing her to rent another property next door. The divorced mother of two had a five-year affair with Fraser after they met through the Ashford Valley Hunt in Kent in 2006, Maidstone Crown Court heard. They split up in October 2011 when Fraser, 64, went back to live with his wife in Shadoxhurst near Ashford. But last year he bought Valentine’s Day flowers for Miss Leggatt, the court heard. Then a few days before the shooting last March he brought her a box of chocolates when he arrived to help her move some boxes. Ian Acheson, prosecuting, said: ‘He tried to give her a cuddle or kiss. She did not reciprocate. They went back to her home where she made him coffee and they chatted. 'These people are fond of horses and members of the hunt and it was the Cheltenham Festival. ‘Louise said that as she was working, she would record the Gold Cup at which Fraser suggested that he come round and they watch it together over a Chinese. When she declined that suggestion, he was miffed and made a jibe or barbed comment as he was leaving.’ Six minutes before leaving his house on the night of the shooting, the court heard, Fraser sent Miss Leggatt a text message, angrily telling her not to ‘make any excuses’ about not watching the Gold Cup the following day with him. Denial: Fraser, (left, outside Maidstone Crown Court where he is on trial) denies attempting to murder Ms Leggatt (right) but has admitted possessing a firearm without a firearms licence between March 14 and 17 . Mr Acheson said: ‘In a fit of pique, . and with the Gold Cup reunion dragged from under his feet, he sent a . text message before trying to kill her, a woman who was causing him pain . and rage.’ The court heard that the master of fox hounds lied to police . twice, having initially denied owning a shotgun and that he had left . his house on the night of the shooting. But a shotgun and cartridges found at . his farm were compatible with the weapon with which Miss Leggatt was . shot, and Fraser was captured on his own CCTV leaving his home around . the time of the shooting, the court heard. Fraser denies attempting to . murder Miss Leggatt on March 15, 2012. She was left with fragments of . shot in her bowel and pelvis, but has made a good recovery. Shooting: Ms Leggatt was shot as she went to tend to her horses at Apple Pie Farm in Benenden, Kent, on March 15 last year, it has been alleged . Shooting: Maidstone Crown Court heard Fraser, 63, pulled the trigger 'in a fit of pique' in a bid to kill Ms Leggatt as she went to tend to her horses . Relationship: Fraser and Ms Leggatt (above) met through the Ashford Valley Hunt, in Kent, in 2006 but split in October 2011 when he went back to live with his wife . Mr Acheson told the court that Miss . Leggatt was at her house that night in Benenden, which is home to the . public school of the same name where Princess Anne was educated. He said: ‘At about 9.30pm she was . going to go outside to tend to her horses. She emerged and turned on the . patio lights. Her dog was barking and had clearly seen something. His . hackles were up. She shone a torch but before she could see or did see . anything, she screamed as she realised she’d been shot.’ Initially, Miss Leggatt accused her . ex-husband Philip Gorringe, as she blamed him for the arson attack.

The father of murdered beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey today reveals he and his wife Patsy were ready to be sent to prison after learning they had been indicted in their daughter's death. 'Our attorneys had us totally prepared to go to jail,' John Ramsey tells People magazine on learning of the grand jury's decision to indict them in 1999 on charges of child abuse resulting in death of their daughter three years earlier. 'We had bail money set up.' Cold case: John and Patsy Ramsey, the parents of murdered beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey, were indicted by a grand jury over her death, but prosecutors refused to press charges, it has been revealed . Unsolved: Six-year-old JonBenet was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado, on Christmas Day in 1996 . The Ramseys only learned they weren't going to be prosecuted after District Attorney Alex Hunter announced at a press conference that he lacked 'sufficient evidence' to file charges against anyone. John Ramsey also told the magazine that he wasn't too concerned on Monday when the Boulder Daily Camera were the first to report news of the indictment. 'It's just more drama,' said Ramsey, 69, who now lives with his third wife, Jan, in Michigan and Nevada. The Ramseys escaped charges because Hunter refused to sign the indictment vote, believing he could not prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, sources said. JonBenet was found bludgeoned . and strangled to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado, . the day after Christmas in 1996. Her parents remained suspects until . finally being exonerated in 2008. No-one has ever been convicted. A lawyer for John Ramsey praised the decision not to prosecute his client. Attorney Bryan Morgan said: 'If what you report actually happened, then there were some very professional and brave people in Alex’s office.' It is unclear whether the DA acted properly in not signing the indictment. However, one expert told the paper that in her opinion proper legal procedure would have been to sign the document and file it with the court before going to open court to dismiss the charges. 'Last picture': JonBenet with her mother, apparently on the morning of her death. Her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008 . Horrific: JonBenet was found with her wrists tied above her head and duct tape over her mouth . Hunter, who left office in 2001 after . 28 years as Boulder County's district attorney, declined to discuss the . grand jury's actions. But he released a statement last week . to the Boulder Daily Camera, saying: 'Colorado statutes, the ethical . canons which govern the practice of law, and the Boulder District . Court's oaths, instructions and orders in the JonBenet Ramsey grand jury . proceedings, are well established and absolutely clear with respect to . the various participants' legal obligations, duties and . responsibilities, including the inviolate secrecy of the proceedings and . the differing burdens of proof applicable to jurors and prosecutors. 'As the duly elected district . attorney at the time and as an officer of the court then and now, I must . respectfully decline further comment.' Defending accusations: Patsy and John Ramsey hold a picture of their daughter during a press conference in 2000 where they released the results of an independent lie detector test, which revealed they had no knowledge of who killed their daughter . Under suspicion: The Ramseys arrive at their attorney's office in August 2000 to answer questions about the death of their daughter . Christmas Day, 1996: Parents of six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey receive a ransom note demanding $118,000 . Boxing Day, 1996: JonBenet found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado . Boulder Police quickly placed her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, under an 'umbrella of suspicion' but they were never formally named as suspects . Detectives were later . criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by . concentrating on the family . 2003: DNA taken from the victim's clothes suggests the family were not involved . 2006: Patsy Ramsey dies of ovarian cancer . August 2006: Former teacher John Mark Karr reportedly confesses to the murder while being held on child pornography charges. But no murder charge brought after his DNA found not to match that on JonBenet's body . 2008: Boulder district attorney's office clears parents of any wrongdoing and issues apology . February 2009: Boulder Police Department takes the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation . On Christmas Day of 1996, the family . received a ransom note saying that JonBenet had been kidnapped and were . demanding $118,000 - the amount of a bonus Mr Ramsey had recently . received - or else she would be beheaded. But it was not long before her body was found in the basement of the house. Her . wrists were tied above her head, and she had duct tape over her mouth. An autopsy report revealed that she had been strangled and bludgeoned to . death. Within hours, the Ramseys themselves . became the chief suspects of the investigation and police were later . criticized for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by . concentrating on the family - including JonBenet's brother Burke - . instead of following up other leads. For . the next 12 years, the blame for their daughter's death - who was given . the name Little Miss Sunshine - lay largely on their shoulders as they . fought to clear their name and find the real killer. Eventually, Boulder district attorney’s office completely cleared the Ramseys of any wrongdoing in their daughter’s slaying and issued an apology in 2008. Since then, John Ramsey has kept the memory of his daughter alive, despite losing his reputation, a thriving business and Patsy to ovarian cancer in 2006. Mr Ramsey eventually found happiness through his relationship with fashion designer Jan Rousseaux, who he married at a private ceremony in Charlevoix, Michigan, in July 2011. Basement case: This 1996 police video shows the basement hours after JonBenet's body was discovered . Last year, a former detective officially broke his silence over the investigation, saying that overlooked clues like cobwebs and a child's toy could prove important in finding the killer in the high-profile cold case. In his self-published book, Foreign Faction: Who Really Kidnapped JonBenet Ramsey?, former detective Jim Kolar reveals thousands of pages worth of investigations and police reports. He said he wanted the truth to be out in the public domain, and has a theory that a children’s toy could be responsible for the marks on JonBenet’s back. Mr Ramsey, told police in 1996 that an intruder broke through a window in the basement. But in macabre police video that shows the basement hours after JonBenet was found dead, Koler pointed out that there are wispy cobwebs, moving ever so slightly. Koler speculates that an intruder would have brushed away the cobwebs upon entering the Ramsey’s residence and thus JonBenet’s killer would have already been inside the house.","JonBenet, 6, found bludgeoned to death at home day after Christmas 1996 .

Bates and Singh were today told to expect a life sentence by judge Simon Tonking . Emma Bate and Parmajit Singh murdered Richard Sherratt by hitting him round the head five times and stabbing him repeatedly . Bate, who was found guilty of murder after a two week trial at Stafford Crown Court, had previously been in a relationship with Mr Sherratt. His semi-naked body was found the next day by his ex-wife who had become concerned when she could not contact him. Property developer Richard Sherratt was found by his ex wife after she became worried when she could not contact him . A post mortem examination revealed that he had suffered 38 separate injuries including five blows to the head. He had also been stabbed in his arm, face and neck, and died after suffocating from blood blocking his airways following the attack in June last year. During the trial, the court heard Bate was working as a prostitute when she got into a relationship with Mr Sherratt last March and soon became 'infatuated' with her. He showered her with gifts, including £8,000 in cash, nights away in upmarket hotels and described her as his girlfriend to his friends. But after the couple split up, Bate became hooked on crack cocaine and she targeted Mr Sherratt, who she knew was well off and kept cash and expensive items at his home. She and Singh concocted a plan to rob Mr Sherratt and the pair drove from their home in Birmingham to his flat in the middle of the night on June 13. After attacking Mr Sherratt they stole his bank cars, cash and a watch worth £10,000, and drove back to Birmingham where they successfully withdrew hundreds of pounds from his account.

The ex-wife of a music school director accused of rape gave a present to a teenage girl her husband was having an affair with, a court heard today. Michael Brewer, 68, is accused of . committing a string of indecent assaults against a girl in the late . 1970s and early 1980s while she was at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester. Mrs Brewer denies sexually assaulting the teenager more than 30 years ago and aiding and abetting her rape. Michael Brewer, 68, left, denies rape and indecent assault and his ex-wife Hilary Brewer, right, denies sexually assaulting the alleged victim and aiding and abetting rape . Mrs Brewer told Manchester Crown Court she had never had any sexual contact with the alleged victim who was . said to be 18 at the time. The jury heard previously that Brewer . quit Chetham's at the end of 1994 after his affair with a different 17-year-old . pupil emerged, in which he regularly fondled her naked breasts in his . office. Giving evidence, Mrs Brewer, who goes by her middle name Kay, was said to have given the AA . Milne book House at Pooh Corner to the 17-year-old her husband was in love with. The book was said to have included an inscription . along the lines of 'Don't worry about things, he is just a normal human . being with all the same insecurities and doubts as you, love Kay'. Mrs Brewer was said to have known . about that relationship and on one occasion allegedly visited her . husband's office where he showed her matching engraved watches he had . bought for himself and his teenage love interest. Asked about her knowledge of that . relationship, Mrs Brewer confirmed she was told about it by her . ex-husband 'a matter of days' before it became public knowledge. 'Did you understand it was a normal teacher/pupil relationship or something different?' Miss Baxter asked. Mrs Brewer replied: 'It was something different. 'That he had fallen in love with her and that she was in love with him as well.' Mr Brewer is accused of a string of assaults against a girl in the late 1970s and early 1980s while she was at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester, pictured . She added she assumed the girl was 18 and that she understood it to be a non-sexual relationship. She said she was in a relationship . herself with another man at the time but that her and the co-defendant . still lived together then. 'We had been married for 20-odd years and we had drifted apart,' she explained. 'We got on fine but the spark had gone.' Miss Baxter asked her what her reaction was when she learned of Brewer's affair. Mrs Brewer said: 'I was happy that he had somebody he was fond of. 'I think he hoped it would go on after she had left school.' She said she could not remember going . to his office to see the watches her husband had bought and could not . recall giving a book to the teenager but conceded that was 'the sort of . thing I might have done'. Under cross examination by prosecutor Peter Cadwallader, Mrs Brewer said she did not think that it was possible there could be any sexual activity between the pair. She said: 'That was not the way he was. I did not know her but I knew him. 'I did not suspect. It did not cross my mind.' She said he was not the type of man to go sleeping around. She denied she was aware that her husband was involved in sexual relationships with either the 17-year-old or the alleged victim in the trial. Mrs Brewer told Manchester Crown Court, pictured, that she was happy for her husband when he began an affair with a 17-year-old girl, who is not the alleged victim . Mr Cadwallader said: 'Even though you . regret it now, in your 30s you sexually assaulted (the alleged victim). Is that not correct?' 'No I did not,' Mrs Brewer replied. 'And you aided and abetted Mr Brewer to rape her,' Mr Cadwallader said. 'No,' she said. Mr Cadwallader continued: 'And you were very sexually excited about the incident?' Mrs Brewer said: 'Absolutely not.' 'You were encouraging (the 17-year-old . girl) to get involved in a similar relationship with your husband in . 1994?', the prosecutor said. 'No,' Mrs Brewer said. 'Did you think that you might have the . opportunity to have a bit of fun with (the 17-year-old) as you did with . (the alleged victim)?' Mr Cadwallader asked. Sighing, the defendant said: 'No.' Mr Brewer was awarded an OBE for services to music in 1995 after he served as director of music at Chetham's. He then became artistic director for the National Youth Choir and has also directed the World Youth Choir. Mrs Brewer, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape. Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies rape and eight counts of indecent assault.

Earl Attlee defended the level of train fares in the UK, before admitting they were 'just too expensive' and had forced him to cancel days out . A transport minister today claimed that he had been priced off the railways by sky-high fares. In a frank admission for someone accountable for rail policy, Earl Attlee declared that ticket prices ‘too expensive for me’, and have even forced him to cancel a day trip to a motor show. The 56-year-old Tory hereditary peer, who earns £63,537 as a spokesman in the House of Lords, said he ‘could not afford’ the prices charged for on-the-day tickets. And he admitted the complex web of different ticket types was baffling, telling peers: 'It must be difficult for ordinary passengers to understand how ticket pricing works.' Less than half of Britain's rail passengers think the railways are value for money, according to a survey this week. At the start of the year passengers were hit with average price rises of nearly 4 per cent. Today Lord Attlee said he had to scrap a planned trip to a motor show at the NEC in Birmingham because he could not afford the fare. He made the admission after being challenged in the Lords about the level of fares. The peer said a recent survey by Passenger Focus had reviewed UK rail fares and although the ‘overall picture was mixed’ the country compared favourably with other European countries ‘in respect of many ticket types particularly on longer distance tickets purchased in advance’. But Labour's Lord Campbell-Savours told him: ‘Tickets on the day of travel are invariably far more expensive that advanced travel tickets.’ Average fares rose by 4 per cent at the start of the year but campaigners say that since the beginning of the recession costs have risen faster than average wages . John Richard Attlee is a Conservative hereditary peer who happens to be the grandson of a Labour Prime Minister. Clement Attlee, who served in Churchill's war cabinet, was PM from 1945-51 and oversaw the creation of the National Health Service. John Attlee, the 3rd Earl, attended the private Stowe School where other alumni include the actor David Niven, the jazz musician George Melly and Prince Harry's Chelsy Davy. After a career in the vehicle repair industry, he entered the House of Lords in 1992 after the death of his father. He started as a non-political crossbencher but joined the Tory party in 1997. He has been a frontbench spokesman on several topics. His cousin Richard Attlee plays Kenton in radio soap The Archers. Lord Atlee, who is the grandson of . Labour prime minister Clement Attlee, replied confessed that he had . abandoned journeys after discovering what rail firms were charging. He . said: ‘When we look at just walking up to Euston and buying a ticket, . it is very expensive and we don't compare well with our continental . partners. ‘But when we look at advanced purchases we do compare quite well. ‘In my case, one day I wanted to go to the NEC to visit the motor show and I could not afford the walk-up fare. Just too expensive for me.’ He also grumbled that train firms have 'difficulty' policing quiet carriages. 'I like a quiet carriage, but some people do not adhere to the rules,' he said. Regulated fares, which include season tickets, increased by an average of 4.2 per cent, with the overall average rise for all tickets being 3.9 per cent. Transport minister Norman Baker outraged passengers this month when he insisted that despite overcrowding, disruption and inflationary fare rises commuters were getting a ‘premium service’. He said fares were not overly expensive when off-peak tickets – and not just the most costly rush-hour ones – were taken into account. Mr Baker accepted the above-inflation rises were ‘not ideal’ and wanted to end them as soon as possible, but did not put a timescale on it. He added: ‘You could argue people who are travelling in the rush hour are using the premium product and ought to pay something which reflects that.’","Earl Attlee challenged about fares rising by 4% this year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:47 EST, 28 October 2011 . Elizabeth 'Beanie' Esteve: She will be allowed to hold divorce proceedings in London after her husband's appeal failed . The multi-million pound divorce of a couple who enjoyed a jetsetting lifestyle must be fought on an English battleground, the Court of Appeal has ruled. Pyrros Vardinoyannis, 41, a scion of a Greek shipping dynasty, and his glamorous Brazilian heiress wife, Elizabeth, 38, met in St Tropez in 2001. Although they initially lived in London, the couple spent time in Los Angeles, Sao Paulo, Milan, Crete and Gstaad. Last year, while Mr Vardinoyannis was in Switzerland and his wife was in London, she petitioned for divorce in this country. Lawyers for Mr Vardinoyannis tried to stop his wife – known to her friends as Beanie Esteve – pursuing her divorce in the notoriously generous English courts. London has been called the ‘divorce capital of the world’, attracting wives as ‘divorce tourists’ seeking bumper payouts. He disputed her claim to have lived in London for the 12 months before she filed for divorce, since she had spent months in Crete and Switzerland. Ruling against the husband at the . High Court earlier this year, Mr Justice Peter Jackson said moving . around was a feature of the family’s lifestyle, and now the Court of . Appeal has upheld the decision. The . ruling means the divorce battle, which has already run up legal costs . of well over £1million, will go ahead in front of an English judge. ‘Just as there are multinational companies, so this is a multinational family,’ Mr Justice Jackson said in his judgement. ‘Their lives have not been tied down . by mundane considerations such as financial budgets, local connections, . immigration restrictions or language limitations. ‘Instead, . they have lived a protracted modern version of the 18th-century Grand . Tour, gravitating towards places where the moneyed international social . set gathers. ‘The . husband, in particular, appeared to struggle in evidence to comprehend . the concept of “home” as applying to his family at all. They have . . . shallow roots.’ Happier times: Elizabeth Esteve and Pyrrhos Vardinoyannis in 2005. They now live separately in London . Mr Vardinoyannis, who describes himself as a private investor, grew up in Switzerland, attended university in the U.S. and moved to London in 1994. His wife was born and brought up in Brazil, went to school in Switzerland and the U.S., university in Paris, then attended an art course in London and worked in a gallery in New York. The couple married in 2003.

Philippe Dubost, a web product manager based in Paris, has received as many as 100 job offers after creating the site, which warns buyers: 'Only one left in stock - Order soon.' He details his dimensions (186 centimeters), offers would-be employers to select a language (as he speaks English, Spanish and French fluently), and notes he can be shipped anywhere in the world. Creative: Philippe Dubost has set up an online resume that perfectly mimics an Amazon webpage . There are also customer reviews, with most awarding him five stars and a few giving him just one star, which he revealed on Twitter is down to 'lots of ex-girlfriends'. If the details take the fancy of any employers, he invites them to 'Add to Cart' - which brings up a contact form. And further mimicking an Amazon page, he asks users beneath each section of his work history: 'Was this review useful to you?' He puts no price on his services; at the top of the page, he has crossed out $999,999, inviting employers to name their own price for his skills. Achiever: Bubost, center, lists his best marathon time on the website as well as his professional history . Adventure: He gives would-be employers the option of selecting a language - English, French or Spanish - and says that he can be shipped anywhere in the world, indicating his love of travel .

Wants his due: 'For at least 25 years, she has been living a major lie,' says former assistant district attorney Steven Pagones, who filed court papers against Brawley for the $431,492 she still owes from a decade-old defamation judgment against her . A former New York prosecutor whose reputation was destroyed after Tawana Brawley falsely called him a 'gang-raping, kidnapping racist' has filed court papers seeking the nearly half a million dollars she owes him, it was revealed today. Steven Pagones, a former Dutchess County prosecutor, says Brawley still owes him . $431,492, including interest, after dragging his name through the mud  in 1987 when he was one of three falsely accused by her of the notorious gang rape. On . November 28, 1987, the then-15-year-old was found in a trash bag, . dazed, smeared with feces with the word 'n****r' scrawled on her body. 'For at least 25 years, she has . been living a major lie,' Pagones said. 'To me, this has always been . about responsibility and accountability,' he said of the more than decade-old defamation judgment against her. She told police she had been abducted by . two white men and driven to the woods where they and four others . ravaged her for four days - one of which had a badge. The case was catapulted onto the . national stage by attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, and the . then-little-known Rev Al Sharpton, who claimed she was raped 33 times. Brawley, who now goes by the name Tawana Gutierrez, is a single mom working as a nurse in . Virginia. She may now have as much as 25 percent of her wages garnished to repay Pagones, his lawyer, Garry Bolnick, told the New York Post. 'People criticize me for going after a hardworking single mother trying to support herself and child,' Pagones said. 'My argument has been she has not been held accountable.' He added that he may drop the suit if Brawley finally admits she made up the horrific accusations. Racial tensions: Rev Al Sharpton catapulted the case of Tawana Brawley, centre, onto the main stage and made him a household name across the country . 'If . she is not going to tell the truth, then it is about the money. That is . the only way to hold her accountable,” said Pagones, who is now . principal owner of a private investigations firm. The Brawley case was a national . scandal and had celebrities weighing in, with Bill Cosby posting a . $25,000 reward for information on the case. Don King promised $100,000 for Brawley’s education and boxer Mike Tyson gave her a $30,000 watch to ease her pain. Here to collect: Pagones says he would consider dropping his demand for money if Brawley admits she made up her story against him. 'If she is not going to tell the truth, then it is about the money. That is the only way to hold her accountable' Fishkill Police Officer Harry Crist Jr. was implicated after being found dead in his apartment a week after Brawley was discovered, and Pagones was also accused when he stepped in with an alibi for the 28-year-old. But in 1988 a grand jury found the whole shocking story was a hoax, and Brawley was never raped. Now 40 years old, The New York Post tracked her down working as a nurse in Virginia. 'I don't want to talk to anyone about that,' Brawley told the newspaper recently as she emerged from her apartment in Hopewell, Virginia, wearing scrubs. Historic case: Reverend Al Sharpton, pictured in 1988, picketed outside the hotel of New York governor Mario Cuomo . She lives what appears to be a relatively normal life in a neatly kept brick apartment complex with signs warning of video surveillance cameras. To avoid detection, Brawley goes by the aliases of Thompson and Gutierrez and has a young daughter, a neighbor told the Post. She reportedly works as a licensed practical nurse at The Laurels of Bon Air in Richmond. But her co-workers have been in the dark about the incredible story of brutality, which turned out to be false. 'Are you serious? We don't know her by that name. Isn't that a trip?' one staffer said, adding that the woman who they call Tawana Gutierrez was 'a good worker.' According to a neighbor, Brawley has lived in Hopewell - Virginia's most crime-laden town - for at least a year. 'Tawana V. Gutierrez' and 'Tawana V. Thompson' have held the same nursing license since 2006, state records show. The Virginia Board of Nursing confirmed issuing it to a 'Tawana Vacenia Thompson Gutierrez.' False claims: Brawley, pictured in 1988, claimed she was gang raped by a group of white men, one of whom had a badge . Rally: Tawana Brawley, left in 1988, of Wappinger Falls, N.Y., was the center of the legal controversy over her rape charges . Brawley maintains a PO box in Claremont, Va., under the name Gutierrez, according to The Post's sources. The grand jury panel, which heard from 180 witnesses over its seven-month investigation, found that Brawley made up the story to avoid being punished for staying out late and missing school. They found evidence she had ran away from home and was hiding out in her parents' former apartment after they got evicted. Many believed that Brawley feared her stepdad Ralph King's and needed an alibi for her absence. King spent seven years in prison in the 1970s for killing his first wife. Traces of the charcoal-like material used to scrawl the hateful word on her body were found under her fingernails, and she showed no signs of genital trauma or exposure, the jury found. One witness said Brawley was spotted climbing into the bin bag. We believe you: The case polarised new York City in the late 1980s . Lawsuit: Tawana Brawley, pictured in 1997, spoke at a rally in support of Alton Maddox who lost a lawsuit for defamation of character by Steven Pagones . 'It is probable that in the history of this state, never has a teenager turned the prosecutorial and judicial systems literally upside down with such false claims,' state Supreme Court Justice S. Barrett Hickman wrote at the time. Pagones has tried to forget the sorry affair but says he can't. 'It'll come up randomly. It'll come up when something happens with Sharpton,' he told The Post. Pagones won a defamation lawsuit against Sharpton, Brawley and her lawyers in 1998. Maddox was found liable for $97,000, Mason for $188,000, and Sharpton was ordered to pay $66,000. Brawley was ordered to pay $190,000 at 9 per cent annual interest but hasn't paid any of that bill. 'Through her silence, she's as guilty of libel as Maddox, Mason and Sharpton,' he told the newspaper. 'The only way to hold her accountable — at least at this stage — is financially.'","Steven Pagones, a former assistant district attorney, says Brawley 'never told the truth about this hoax or paid me a cent'

An East Pennsylvania high school has outlawed toilet paper from the boys bathrooms - forcing students to check it out of the school's office as and when they need it. The new rule, intended to cut vandalism at the Mahanoy Area High School, has been criticized by some parents who say students are too embarrassed to publicly ask for tissue. One mother said she had heard of students leaving school claiming to be sick so they could go home and use the toilet there. Toilet roll control: Principal of Mahanoy Area High School has introduced a ban on tissue in the boys toilets in his school, pictured. Instead male students need to register and collect paper from the school office . Principal, Thomas Smith, defended the measure at a school meeting on Thursday saying vandals had 'destroyed' toilets over the years blocking them up with toilet paper and sometimes even books. 'We've had serious destruction to our bathrooms for the past two years,' Mr Smith said, according to the Republican Herald of Potsville. 'We have a case pending with the police where a bathroom down by our gymnasium was absolutely destroyed.' 'I'm sure Mr. (Robert) Pastucha (district facilities director) could tell you the times that our toilets have been jammed with toilet paper and other papers.' 'And after we took the toilet tissue out of there, people were throwing books. It was our way to try to curb the destruction in the bathrooms.' Embarrassed: One parent complained that toilet rules at Mahanoy High School humiliated students. Male students have to check-out paper from the school office and check it back in when they are finished . 'I agree that it's a drastic measure,' he added. Boys have to request the paper from either the school office or the nurse signing it out - and back in again when they have used all they need, the local newspaper reports. Meanwhile Mr Smith has been doing spot checks on the toilets to ensure nothing is going on against the rules. 'We're not refusing anyone toilet paper,' Mr Smith continued. 'You would sign out and then sign back in. I randomly go in to check if anything is going on. Since we've done that, we've cut down on the destruction.' Karen Yedsena, a parent at the school of Mahanoy City, complained about the measure at the meeting. She also pointed out that the school's rule of refusing students permission to going to the toilet any other time than the first five minutes of class was equally draconian. 'We're cutting down on people walking through the hallways for no reason,' Superintendent Joie Green responded according to the report.","Under the rule boys are forced to check out and check back in toilet paper on a register held at the school office or nurse's room .

The terrified woman gave desperate cries for help but passers-by ignored the crime, as Hindson even felt her neck to see if she was wearing a chain.

Mugger: Monica Cismaru (right) was beaten up and robbed by David Hindson (left) who was jailed today after he grabbed her by the neck and demanded her belongings . Details of the horrific 'walk on by' incident emerged as Hindson, from Accrington, Lancashire, was jailed for three and a half years after admitting robbery and theft. Today Miss Cismaru was still too upset to talk about her ordeal last November. Burnley Crown Court was told the incident occurred while Miss Cismaru was walking through Accrington town centre at 8.10pm. Hindson who was leaning against a wall noticed the victim walk past him whilst she was chatting on her mobile phone. Scene: Hindson who was leaning against a wall in Portland Street (pictured) noticed the victim walk past so he went for her . Moments later she then felt somebody grab her around the neck. Miss Sarah Statham prosecuting said Miss Cismaru struggled to break free and tried to keep hold of her phone but Hindson pulled it from her grip. Criticism: Residents of Accrington (pictured) have been accused of turning a blind eye to the attack . He then kept his arm around her neck and then went for her shoulder bag, which contained important personal documents. Miss Cismaru continued to struggle, but the defendant took her bag and then made another grab for her neck, shouting : 'The chain, the chain.' She wasn't wearing a necklace and Hindson eventually ran off after a further struggle when there was nothing else to steal from the victim. The prosecutor said : 'She was absolutely terrified. She was crying, went back home and immediately telephoned the police. 'She was upset that nobody came to help her. Until the incident, she had always felt safe, but she is now frightened to go out anywhere on her own.' Hindson later confessed to robbing Miss Cismaru to a 16-year-old girl and appeared to find it 'funny'. He also asked how much he could get from selling the phones. Miss Cismaru's missing iPhone was later found under a mattress at the home of Hindson's girlfriend. None of the other property was recovered. It emerged after the mugging Hindson had sneaked into a house in the early hours of the next day and help himself to another mobile phone and handbag from the bedside cabinet of a mother as she lay asleep in bed. The court heard Hindson had been abusing drugs since he was 11 and had a cocktail of drink and cannabis in the moments before the mugging. He had 32 previous offences on his record, which included seven charges of possessing an offensive weapon, three of affray and four of assault. He was once described in court as 'dangerously out of control,' after threatening another woman with a knife and a shovel in separate attacks. In mitigation defence counsel Mr Daniel King said : 'At the time, he was feeling depressed and anxious. 'He had no permanent accommodation and drink and drugs - related problems. He had been drinking and taking cannabis. He really can't explain or excuse his behaviour in any way further than that.'","David Hindson jailed for three-and-a-half-years for attack on Monica Cismaru .

Janusz Kosik murdered an innocent man over a noisy TV after he exploited EU border controls to settle legally in Britain . A convicted criminal from Poland murdered an innocent man over a noisy TV after he exploited EU border controls to settle legally in Britain. Janusz Kosik, 57, had already served an eight year jail term for battering his pregnant girlfriend so badly she was left with brain damage and the baby had to be adopted. Yet despite his conviction he was allowed to move to the UK without checks by the Home Office to work following the abolition of the Government's Worker Registration Scheme. Within weeks of moving into a flat in Manchester, Kosik slashed and stabbed flatmate Radoslaw Waclawiak after flying into rage about their TV being too loud. Fellow Pole Mr Waclawiak, 25, known as Radic was knifed in the heart and died later in hospital. Kosik pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed for life at Manchester Crown Court, which heard the killer had a history of 'explosive violence'. In 2002 while living in Canada, Kosik repeatedly beat his girlfriend into a coma while she was carrying his child during a row over money. Their baby boy was delivered as she lay in hospital for six weeks with a severe head injury. But when she finally emerged from her coma, the victim didn't recognise the baby as her own or recall being pregnant. She was left with the mental capacity of a four- to six-year-old and was expected to have to spend the rest of her life in care. Her son has since been adopted. In 2004 Kosik pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and obstructing police and was jailed for eight years. At the time a prosecutor in Canada said it was 'the most horrific case of domestic abuse you could imagine short of murder.' Following Kosik's release it is believed he returned to his native Poland before taking up his right to work in the UK after the ending in 2011 of restrictions on incoming workers from eight Eastern European member states of the European Union. Just weeks after moving into the flat in Crumpsall, Manchester, Kosik slashed and stabbed flatmate Radoslaw Waclawiak after flying into rage about their TV being too loud . He met Mr Waclawiak through their work at a car wash and they and two other Polish men moved into a flat in Martingale Court, Crumpsall, Manchester. Mr Waclawiak gave his bedroom in the flat to Kosik, while he slept in the lounge, in an 'act of generosity' just two months before the murder. But Kosik had violent mood swings and in the days before the killing Kosik threw a glass at Mr  Waclawiak which smashed against the wall. He also took a hammer out of the kitchen and threatened Radoslaw and the other two men. The murder occurred last September after Kosik spent most of the evening in his bedroom and made complaints about the volume of the television. Family say Radoslaw Waclawiak (pictured) had moved to England to try to find work and carve a better life for himself . At about 1am on September 22 Kosik stormed into one of the bedrooms were Mr Waclawiakwas smoking a cigarette. Police said Kosik went up to him with a large kitchen knife, slashed him in the face and stabbed him in the chest before fleeing the scene and leaving the victim to die. He was arrested the following day as he loitered at a soup kitchen. Kosik must serve a minimum 21 years before being considered for parole. Judge Andrew Gilbart QC told him: 'You inflicted a terrible attack. Given the presence of two wounds, I am satisfied that at the time of the blow being struck, you intended to kill him.' After the case Senior Investigating Officer Harry Harrison from Greater Manchester Police said: 'Radoslaw came to England to make a better life for himself and instead was tragically killed by a man living under the same roof. 'The three men were kind enough to invite Kosik in to their home and viciously attacked and killed Radoslaw. 'Today's result should provide some solace for Radoslaw's friends and family and will hopefully provide some basis for them to move forward in their lives without him.' The dead man's grandmother Halina Kroikowska said: 'Radic went to England to make a better life for himself. 'He was always a good boy and he was a very good grandson. Radic was only 25 years old, he was so young - why did this happen to him?' The case comes as restrictions are due to lifted on citizens from Romania and Bulgaria coming to work in the UK. Plans have already been drawn up for an advertising campaign denouncing Britain as cold and wet in a bid prevent a new influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe.","Janusz Kosik, 57, served eight years for battering his pregnant girlfriend .

Sacked: Headteacher Bernie Routledge claims he was unfairly dismissed from his role as headteacher of the exclusive Howell's School in Wales . The sacked principal of an exclusive girls-only boarding school allegedly breached his own rules on social networking by commenting on an appreciation page dedicated to himself - called BRAS. Bernie Routledge commented on the page called the Bernie Routledge Appreciation Society - set up by pupils at another school - while head of the Howell's School in Denbigh north Wales, an employment tribunal has heard. Mr Routledge, who was principal of the school for nine months before he was sacked in May 2011, is said to have used the page to interact with pupils over two days in 2009. He claims that he was unfairly dismissed by the school, which boarders pay £18,000-a-year to attend. John Benson, representing Mr Routledge at the Wrexham hearing, questioned Howell's School trustee Robert Locke's handling of the situation yesterday. The hearing was told that there were ten allegations of misconduct against Mr Routledge, of Gwernaffield near Mold, number one being social networking with children. Mr Locke said: 'Mr Routledge wrote the social networking rules himself, which he breached.' He added that he had contacted children's services and the police, but was told it was not a criminal matter and should be dealt with by the school. Mr Benson asked Mr Locke why he never spoke to Mr Routledge about the Facebook page before suspending him. He also claimed Mr Locke was already 'livid' with the principal following a boarding inspection and said it was the start of a campaign to get rid of him. Mr Locke admitted there were 'procedural flaws for not permitting an appeal for Mr Routledge'. Mr Routledge's partner, Helen Price, former head of pastoral care at the school, is also claiming unfair dismissal. Exclusive: Mr Routledge and his partner Helen Price were sacked from the Howell's School in north Wales . Fee paying: Boarders pay £18,000 a year to attend the Howell's School . She was pregnant at the time of her sacking. Mr Locke, who dismissed Mr Routledge following an investigation carried out by his brother Alan Locke, said of Ms Price's dismissal: 'It was abrupt and because of her conduct at Mr Routledge's disciplinary hearing there was a complete breakdown of mutual trust. Dismissal hearing: It is alleged that there were 10 misconduct allegations against Mr Routledge, pictured . 'Ms Price was a child protection officer at the school and in our view she failed as she was in a relationship with the headmaster. 'I am concerned there was no whistleblowing from Ms Price regarding Mr Routledge.' Mr Benson asked Robert Locke why Ms Price was never given a disciplinary hearing and was never told the outcome of her grievance hearing. Robert Locke said: 'She showed her views at Mr Routledge's hearing and we did not want to give them another hearing to berate us [the trustees].' He added that it was 'because of the seriousness of the allegations against her partner Mr Routledge'. 'We were not going to put Ms Price through an investigation as this puts her under pressure, especially as she was pregnant at the time,' he said. Mr Routledge previously taught at The King's School in Chester. He was appointed deputy principal at Howell's in 2010, and took over as principal a few months later.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:05 EST, 30 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:14 EST, 30 January 2013 . Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond's chosen question for the referendum on independence has been rejected by the Electoral Commission for being worded to encourage people to vote Yes . The elections watchdog today threw out an attempt by Alex Salmond to skew the question in the Scottish independence referendum to coax people into voting Yes. The Scottish Government wanted to ask voters: 'Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country? Yes/No.' But the independent Electoral Commission has demanded 'more neutral wording' and insisted voters have a clearer idea about what severing ties with the rest of the UK will mean for Scotland. It also recommended the main Yes and No campaigns be allowed to spend up to £1.5million each in the run up to the big vote. The rejection of Mr Salmond's question comes after a poll showed support his dream of going it alone is now at its lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999. Just 23 per cent of people want Scotland to leave the UK, the annual Scottish Social Attitudes survey for 2012 revealed. It . showed a dramatic drop from 2011 when 32 per cent supported . independence. Almost 60 per cent of those surveyed now say they are . ‘quite’ or ‘very’ worried about independence, up from 46 per cent in . 2011. Mr Salmond has secured a deal with David Cameron to stage a referendum on independence in autumn 2014. Plain language experts were consulted about Mr Salmond's proposed question, and in surveys it was repeatedly found to be designed to encourage people to back independence . In focus groups voters said Mr Salmond's wording 'implies that Scotland being independent is a ""good thing"" because voters are being invited to agree with this view' and suggested independence was 'inevitable' and voters were being asked to 'rubber-stamp' it. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon used Twitter to announce the Scottish government would accept the recommendations . The Scottish government wanted to ask: . 'Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country? Yes/No.' But the Electoral Commission said it was a leading question and proposed: . 'Should Scotland be an independent country? Yes/No.' The recommendation has been accepted. One person said: 'You’re free to say no, but it goes against the grain with that word[agree], you don’t feel comfortable putting no.' The Commission has now drawn up an alternative: 'Should Scotland be an independent country? Yes/No.' Deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote on Twitter this morning: 'I can confirm that the Scottish Government will accept all of the Electoral Commission's #indyref recommendations.' John McCormick, Electoral Commissioner . for Scotland said: 'Voters are entitled to a referendum which produces a . result they can have confidence in. 'We have rigorously tested the proposed . question, speaking to a wide range of people across Scotland. Any . referendum question must be, and be seen to be, neutral. People told us . that they felt the words ""Do you agree"" could lead voters towards voting Yes.' Mr Salmond last year struck a deal with David Cameron to hold a referendum on independence in autumn 2014 . Research by the watchdog also found that voters want factual information ahead of the referendum. 'Although we would not expect the terms of independence to be agreed before the vote, clarity about how the terms of independence will be decided would help voters understand how the competing claims made by campaigners before the referendum will be resolve,' the Commission added. The UK and Scottish governments should agree a 'joint position' on how independence would be negotiated before the referendum. Mr McCormick added: 'People had a clear understanding that ‘independent country’ meant being separate from the UK. 'But they did want factual information in advance about what will happen after the referendum. We’re asking the UK and Scottish Government to provide that clarity and we’ll then make sure it gets to voters as part of our public awareness campaign.' Better off in: The Scottish Social Attitudes survey revealed only 23 per cent of people want Scotland to be independent, the lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999 . The Commission also set out details of how much the two sides should spend in the run up to the referendum. The two lead campaigns fighting funds would be capped at £1.5million each. Among parties in the Scottish Parliament, the pro-independence Scottish National Party would be allowed £1.34million, while opponents would be capped at £84,000 for Scottish Labour, £396,000 for Scottish Conservatives and £201,000 for Scottish Lib Dems and £150,000. The Green Party could spend £150,000.","Alex Salmond wanted to ask: 'Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country? Yes/No.'

Britons who store their data on cloud-based servers in America could have all their files rooted through in secret by the U.S. government, it emerged today. Campaigners say a renewed . piece of American legislation will allow federal agencies to spy on foreign . nationals without warning. The U.S. government granted itself the . right to snoop after its secret rubber-stamping of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This means anyone abroad using the internet storage facilities provided by . American companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple, open themselves up to investigation by the federal authorities - while Americans are protected because of their constitution. Changes: The U.S. government can spy on a foreigner's data after quietly renewing legislation allowing them to snoop . Cloud computing allows internet users to store their information and data in an network server as opposed to in a physical memory stick or tangible location on their hard drive or on their smartphones. FISA was first put into place under President George W. Bush in 2008, and it was quietly renewed in December under President Obama. The legislation allows a large swath of the federal government, including the CIA, the FBI, and the National Security Agency, to look at any information they would like that is saved on cloud servers. They claim it can help them uncover crime and protect the country from terrorism. One of the most shocking portions of the legislation is the fact that the officials do not need to use the guise of a threat to national security as a way to justify their snooping. At risk: All data stored in network clouds, used by companies like Apple, can now be accessed by the U.S. government . Round one: The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was initially signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008 (pictured) but was renewed by President Obama in December 2012 . They are able to look into foreign individuals' data for purely political reasons as well. A report produced about the topic stresses that it is 'much graver risk to EU data sovereignty than other laws hitherto considered by EU policy-makers'. Slate quoted Caspar Bowden, who co-wrote the report which is now being examined by the European Union, as saying that the legislation has been so gravely ignored by European government officials. 'It's like putting a mind control drug in the water supply, which only affects non-Americans,' he said. For now, privacy advocates appear to be the only ones up in arms about the issue. Google responded to requests made by The Independent, saying: 'It is possible for the US government (and European governments) to access certain types of data via their law enforcement agencies. We think this kind of access to data merits serious discussion and more transparency.'","Obama agreed renewal of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in December .

When Dawn Maw’s champion dog was stolen in front of her eyes she vowed to get her back no matter what the cost. Eight weeks later Angel, a German short-haired pointer, is still missing but her devoted owner has been true to her word. Not only has she remortgaged her home to put up a £10,000 reward for Angel’s safe return, but she has also put her life on hold, cancelling Christmas and taking unpaid leave from work. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dawn Maw, 42, is offering a five figure sum to anyone with information that leads her to four-year-old dog Angel. Mrs Maw says her champion dog was taken from a car park near Barnsley, South Yorkshire . Angel was bought for £700 when she was a puppy and has appeared at Crufts . She estimates that her obsession with finding the animal has cost her £12,000. Mrs Maw, who is married with one child . and two stepchildren, is an investigator for the Department for Work . and Pensions, and hasn’t been to work since the dognapping on December . 6. She has used up her holiday time and is having to negotiate unpaid . time off. Christmas in her household was . cancelled because ‘a member of the family was missing’ and instead she . spent the festive season spreading the word on Angel far and wide. She . spent £3,000 putting up 15,000 posters and distributing 35,000 business . cards around her home town. Another £500 has gone on hiring a pet detective agency and countless hours have been spent on the computer. She said her credit cards are all . ‘maxed out’ and she has spent hundreds of pounds on petrol and phone . bills, dealing with inquiries and investigating sightings all over the . country. The stress has meant Mrs Maw has lost two stone and she has been given sleeping tablets by her doctor. The last picture of Angel before her theft. Mrs Maw called the police but so far officers have been unable to locate the culprit . Mrs Maw has created a Facebook page and is offering the £10,000 reward - believed to be one of the largest offered - for anyone with information to come forward . The 42-year-old set up a Facebook page to promote the search and hundreds of supporters donated £3,000 for a reward to find Angel, who has won five champion titles at dog shows nationwide. When that didn’t work she decided to raise an extra £7,000 herself. Her electrician husband Dominic,  42, initially objected to remortgaging their home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, to put up a more impressive five- figure reward. He was persuaded to change his mind. ‘He wants an easy life and it’s the only way life is going to return to normal in our house,’ declared Mrs Maw. She has spent £3,000 distributing 15,000 posters, and 35,000 business cards, in her home town . Commenting on the sacrifices she has made to find Angel, she said: ‘She is part of my family and belongs here in the house with me. I believe a dog is for life and not a throwaway item.’ Her other dogs are Lucy (English Pointer), Rattan (German short-haired pointer) and Mouse (Weimaraner). Angel was bought for £700 as a puppy and has competed at Crufts. Aged four, she was destined to compete in many more shows, as well as being a working gun dog, when she was snatched. Mrs Maw was on her usual early morning routine walking the dogs. She was helping one of the others   back into her car when a white Transit van stopped and a gang threw Angel into the back and  sped off. She believes she had  been watched for a while before  the theft. ‘She can’t breed, so I expect someone knew she was a champion and decided to steal her,’ she said. ‘I feel my life has ended as I did everything with her. Out of all my dogs, she was the one I took to shows all the time. ‘We didn’t celebrate Christmas  at all and you wouldn’t have known what time of year it was in my house.’ Angel has been microchipped and there are blood samples from her relatives for DNA identification.  The reward for her is believed to be the highest offered for the return of a dog in Britain. Mrs Maw said she received some phone calls as a result of the initial offer but nothing came of them. ‘I decided to increase the fee because I am desperate to get Angel back. ‘The reward will be for her safe return or for information that leads directly to her. ‘It will be paid in cash. I am simply determined to find her.’ The deal with their bank means the mortgage has been extended by five years to 20 years.

Paraplegic: Laura Coward was working at a racehorse training stables when she fell off Saucy Night . A promising young rider who was paralysed when she was thrown from a history-making racehorse has launched a multi-million pound compensation claim against the stables and trainer. Stablehand Laura Coward was 17 when she broke her neck after taking Saucy Night for a trial ride in Wiltshire in November 2008. The racehorse had made headlines three years earlier when he became the first to win a race without wearing horseshoes. He had retired from racing by the time Ms Coward, now 21, took him and she had not ridden for some time - but she says the stables assured her it would be fine. She lost control as the horse gathered speed and fell on to wooden fencing around the riding arena, breaking her back. Ms Coward had surgery to stabilise her severed spinal cord but remains paralysed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair. She is now suing the stables of Horse First Racing Ltd, where she was working at the time of the accident. The stables, founded by entrepreneur Eamonn Wilmott, are the home of leading Australian trainer Jeremy Gask, 34. Ms Coward, of Codford, Wilts., has made a claim with the High Court which details her accident. Her barrister John Isherwood sets out her claim that she was a keen horsewoman and was offered the chance to take Saucy Night on loan from the stables. He had entered the record books on January 3, 2005 when he won a 2.5 mile steeplechase at Folkestone ‘barefoot’. Mr Isherwood said Ms Coward claims she first took the horse on a trial ride in his training area to test her ability on him. He said she told a member of staff she had not ridden for some time but was assured that although Saucy Night was strong, ‘she would be fine’. Painful: Ms Coward fell through a fence and broke her back after she lost control of the horse . Injured: Ms Coward says the stables told her she 'would be fine' riding the history-making racehorse . But the horse quickly went from a walk to a trot and the teenager was unable to control him as he accelerated further. She lost her right stirrup and started to panic as the horse began galloping even faster. One of the stable staff tried to stop him by waving her arms, but it failed to work and Ms Coward lost her other stirrup and was thrown from the saddle. Mr Isherwood claims Horses First breached its own health and safety policy by allowing her to ride in the circumstances, without the horse being led by a rope. He alternatively claims that the horse had suffered an attack of an equine condition known as ‘the strangles’ some weeks earlier which would have made him resistant to being ridden. The allegations have yet to be tested in court. No one was available for comment at the stables. In a statement released today, Horses First Racing said: 'Laura's accident was a terrible tragedy. 'Laura was well liked on the yard and good with the horses, although she never rode for us - the accident had nothing to do with her work. 'Horses First is a close knit team and we have kept Laura on the payroll. 'We have always hoped she might be able to come back to work for us in a different role but at this point in her recovery she hasn't felt able to talk to us about that. 'You will appreciate that because Laura has brought court proceedings and solicitors are involved, there is a limit to what we can say to the press but despite our deep sympathy for Laura's serious injuries, what happened was a riding accident and any criticism of our staff is not justified.'","Laura Coward was just 17 when she broke her back by falling on to a fence .

The six-month-old baby boy at the centre of a tug-of-love custody battle between a wealthy Pfizer executive and the family of his dead girlfriend will languish in foster care until it is resolved. Jonathan Sporn's girlfriend Leann Leutner - who was raising son Lincoln together with her 54-year-old partner in New York - committed suicide on New Year's Day, and her son was taken into care because Mr Sporn is not his biological father. Mr Sporn, a high-ranking executive with the pharmaceutical giant, yesterday faced his late girlfriend's sister at the Manhattan Supreme Court, where a judge said baby Lincoln would remain in foster care pending the outcome of the case. Tragic: Jonathan Sporn is fighting for custody of his late girlfriend Leann Leutner's six-month-old baby boy . Custody fight: Pfizer executive Jonathan Sporn, left, has filed a petition to get the baby back after the 40-year-old lawyer, right, took her own life on New Year's Day . His girlfriend's sister Susan Sylvester, 36, of Illinois, is fighting Mr Sporn for custody of the baby. Ms Leutner, a 40-year-old corporate lawyer, gave birth to Lincoln after undergoing IVF using an anonymous sperm donor. She and Mr Sporn had been raising the baby at Sporn's apartment in Manhattan until her death. Judge Laura Drager said at the start of yesterday's hearing: 'I believe it would be in the best interest of the child to have this matter resolved as soon as possible', but she added that the baby would remain in the care of social services until the dispute is resolved. 'I am begging this court to assist me in piecing together the shattered pieces of my heart,' Mr Sporn said in his petition for custody, according to a report in the New York Post. The newspaper quoted a long-time friend of Ms Leutner as saying she had been estranged from her family. Troubled: Leutner, a high-powered Manhattan corporate lawyer, had a history of mental illness and suffered from post-partum depression after giving birth to her son . Loving dad: Sporn said he was raising baby Lincoln as his own, even though the child was not biologically his because his girlfriend had been forced to use a sperm donor . Home: Leutner, Sporn and their baby lived in the Pfizer director's apartment on the Upper West Side for two years . Sporn said in the petition cited by DNAInfo.com that words cannot describe the joy he felt when little baby Lincoln was born last July. The 54-year-old man and his . 40-year-old girlfriend, a Manhattan corporate lawyer, could not . naturally conceive a baby, so Leutner had to undergo in-vitro . fertilization using an anonymous sperm donor. The couple and their new baby lived in Sporn's apartment on Riverside Drive in Manhattan for two years, but they never wed. The . family idyll came to a tragic end on New Year's Day when the . 40-year-old mother took her own life by jumping out the window of her . New Jersey apartment. Since . then, the New Jersey Department of Child Protection took the infant . away. In a desperate bid to get Lincoln back, Sporn submitted a . heart-rending petition to the Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday asking . the state to award him custody of the boy whom he considers his son. 'I . cannot change history, (the mother) is gone and while that in . unbearable in and of itself, the fact that my son is being cared for by . strangers and away from me, his dad, is equally unendurable,' Sporn . wrote. Sporn, a director of clinical . research for Pfizer with a six-figure salary, met Leutner, a brilliant but emotionally troubled . Yale Law School graduate, in 2010. The couple, both divorced, began . dating and soon became inseparable, spending every weekend together and . traveling around the country. According . to Sporn's petition, he and Leutner were very close and even made up . pet names for one another. She called him 'boysee,' while he nicknamed . her 'dollzy.' Caregiver: Leutner, left, was committed twice after making attempts on her life, during which time Sporn, right, was left to care for their son on his own . By December 2010, Leutner, a . high-powered attorney at the renowned Manhattan law firm Simpson, . Thatcher and Bartlett LLP, moved into Sporn's apartment on the Upper . West Side. 'As our love for one another deepened, . it was obvious that I wanted to spend eternity with Leann, to have a . family with her,' Sporn said in his petition. But . the couple soon discovered that they could not naturally conceive a . child. Determined to have a family, Leutner went to an IVF clinic at New . York University and began a grueling regimen of hormone injections and . other treatments. After . several failed attempts to have embryos implanted in her womb, Leutner . considered getting an egg donor, but Sporn urged her to keep trying . because he wanted her to have a baby that was biologically hers. The couple eventually decided to get a sperm donor, and Leutner finally became pregnant. When . baby Lincoln was born in July, the couple were elated, and Sporn . settled into the role of a caring father, reading to the infant, . changing his diapers and playing make-believe with him. But . Leutner had a tough time getting over her post-partum depression. The . woman had a history of mental illness, and during pregnancy she stopped . taking the anti-depressant Prozac, according to court documents. Around Thanksgiving, Leutner's emotional state took a turn for the worse, and she attempted to take her life but jumping out the window. Sporn and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, who was a close friend, admitted the mother at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. With Leutner temporarily out of the picture, Sporn said he became a hands-on dad, 'falling deeper and deeper in love with this child,' he wrote. 'I looked forward to his cries in the night just to have another opportunity to hold this child in my arms and soothe him back to sleep.' After 10 days in the hospital, Leutner was released home, but a few days later she made another attempt on her life by trying to jump down the shaft of a stairwell. She was committed again, but was determined to leave the hospital, which she ended up doing on December 17 with the help of a friend. The 40-year-old woman and her son went to New Jersey, where she rented an apartment of her own. Two days after settling in the new place, Leutner plummeted to her death from the 14th floor of her building. Sporn said he only learned of the tragedy from New Jersey caseworkers who informed him that the baby was in the custody of the state. According to the petition, before her death Leutner had executed a formal document naming Sporn as Lincoln's guardian, and she was in the process of changing his last name to Leutner-Sporn.","Pfizer exec Jonathan Sporn's girlfriend committed suicide on New Year's Day .

As Lance Armstrong pleads for a second chance after his bombshell doping admission, his stepmother is calling him a hypocrite for refusing to forgive the sins of his own father. Rebecca Gunderson, whose husband Eddie was Lance's biological father, alleges her husband tried to apologize to the son he never knew before his death in 2012 but Lance was unyielding and refused to hear him out. As critics line up to throw stones at Armstrong, he spoke out on Wednesday for the first time since his Oprah interview, complaining that he is taking the fall for the sport's doping crisis. Scroll down for video. Estranged: Lance Armstrong was adopted by his mother's second husband after his biological father Eddie Gunderson, right, divorced his mothers in 1973. Eddie died in 2012 having not seen his son since the 1970s . Armstrong revealed that he had used performance enhancing drugs to secure his seven Tour de France wins, in an interview with Oprah that aired on Jan. 17 and 18. He was in Hawaii when the interview was broadcast and has mainly stayed under the radar amid the media storm. He has apologized to the staff at his cancer research foundation and is seeking forgiveness from disillusioned fans. But one side of his family is speaking out about the irony of his so-called contrition effort. Support: Linda Armstrong Kelly, left with Lance in 1999 after Lance's Tour de France victory and at an event in 2009, has supported her son's cycling career and cancer research effort . Lance's stepmother, who has never had a relationship with the shamed cyclist, told the National Enquirer that her husband had tried to make amends with his son before he died at the age of 59 in 2012 but she says Lance showed no willingness to forgive. Eddie Gunderson married Lance's mother, . Linda, when she was just 17. Lance's birth parents divorced when he was two in 1973 after a turbulent and abusive relationship, according to Linda. Linda's second husband, Terry Keith Armstrong, adopted Lance and raised him as his own until Lance's teenage years when Linda and Terry divorced due to Terry's infidelity. Team Lance: Lance Armstrong said his former wife Kristin, left in 2001, and his current girlfriend Anna Hansen, right in 2011, were supportive of his interview with Oprah . At the height of his son's career, Gunderson pursued a relationship with the cyclist but Lance was not interested. 'I . was his worst supporter. I didn't want him to win at all' the spurned . father had said in 2010, about not supporting his son in the Tour de France, . according to an article by French reporter Françoise Inizan in Le . Temps. But now, Gunderson's wife said her husband desperately had wanted to reconcile with Lance. 'He . tried to apologize to Lance but Lance always refused to meet with him. I saw Eddie cry over this many, many nights. His last wish was to see . Lance once before he died, but that never happened,' she told the tabloid. 'Lance's . dad deserved a second chance too but his son never gave it to him. And . now that Eddie's dead, it's too late,' Rebecca Gunderson added. Coming clean: In a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, Lance Armstrong admitted that after years of denying it, he did in fact take performance enhancing drugs to secure his 7 Tour de France wins . With attention being paid to his family, Lance Armstrong has said that they were supportive of his choice to go public with his past in an shocking confession on the Oprah Winfrey Network. 'They were well aware of what I was doing and going to say. They loved the interview. I was in Hawaii when it aired but my older kids and [first wife] Kristin watched both nights live. We spoke immediately after both shows. What was said then I'll keep to myself.' he told Cycling News in his first interview since the January television event. In an attempt to move forward, Armstrong is now calling for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to deal with the doping crisis in cycling. He suggests that the commission offer amnesty to riders and officials who come clean as the 'only way' to understand the scope of the issue and effectively deal with the problem. 'We all made the mess, let's all fix the mess, and let's all be punished equally,' he added. Harsh words: Armstrong called Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) President Pat McQuaid pathetic and accused him of just trying to cover his own tracks in the wake of the cyclist's doping admission . 'Publicly lynching one man and his team will not solve this problem,' he said, alluding to the suspected widespread use of drugs in the sport. 'My generation was no different than any other...the fact remains that our sport is damn hard, the Tour was invented as a 'stunt, and very tough mother f*****s have competed for a century and all looked for advantages.' 'No generation was exempt or ""clean,""' he said in his defense. Mr Armstrong also dished out some harsh words about the commission that regulates cyclists, Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) saying its current head, Pat McQuaid, is inept. 'Many months ago I said, ""Pat, you better think bold here. A full blown, global, TRC is our sports best solution."" He wanted to hear nothing of it.' 'Pat is just in constant CYA (Cover Your Ass) mode. Pathetic,' Armstrong said, adding that 'The UCI has no place at the table' in creating an adequate solution.","Lance Armstrong's biological father, Eddie Gunderson, left when Lance was a child .

"By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 06:26 EST, 29 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:57 EST, 29 January 2013 . Plans for an £50 million ($80m) Earthquake early warning system for California have been unveiled. The ShakeAlert system, which has taken ten years to develop, would give a minute's warning of a major quake. Experts say this would give residents critical time for residents to 'duck and cover' and for utilities to power down. Scroll down for video demo . A simulation of a major earthquake along the an Andreas Fault, from the Salton Sea to downtown Los Angeles. Researchers today launched a bill for $80m of funding for an early warning system for the whole of Californai, which would use 2,000 sensors already in place to look for waves that signal the start of a fault line rupturing. The system is based on a . highly sophisticated algorithm that can send out a signal from any one . of the 2,000 quake-detecting instruments already in place up and down the . state. An alert would go out whenever the system senses a temblor's . first pulse of short shock waves - known as P waves - that speed through . the ground just as a seismic fault starts to rupture. Those waves cause no damage, but they . are followed by the longer and more destructive pulses known as S-waves. The ShakeAlert system instantly predicts the quake's magnitude and also . calculates the time in seconds when the damaging shock waves will reach . any region in California where people are equipped to receive the . signal. The warning time will depend on the distance between a quake's epicenter and . the location where the S-waves will arrive. For . example, the researchers said, in one test of the ShakeAlert system last year, a . very small quake hit near the epicenter of the deadly 1989 Loma Prieta . temblor. The system correctly predicted that its magnitude would be only . 3.5 and warned San Francisco locations that its shock waves would reach . there exactly 25 seconds after the quake ruptured near Santa Cruz. It uses a network of 2,000 quake-detecting instruments now in place up and down the state. Its backers say it could . warn emergency workers and the public as much as a full minute before a . big quake ruptures the ground along any of the faults in the state. There . is a 99 percent chance of a magnitude-6.7 earthquake or larger in the . next 30 years in California because of the number of fault lines in the . region, the biggest of which is the 810 mile San Andreas Fault that . forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North . American Plate. Using the . new system, an alert would go out whenever the system senses the first . pulse of short shock waves - known as P waves - that speed through the . ground just as a seismic fault starts to rupture. California senator Alex Padilla, said . his bill, SB135, is based on recent advances in preparing the . California warning system to operate. Padilla, an MIT-trained engineer from . the San Fernando Valley and a former space systems software specialist, . said it could provide 'critical seconds for teachers to get their . pupils to duck and cover, for drivers to pull to the side of the road, . for trains to stop, and for utilities to power down.' The plans, unveiled at a news . conference at the California Institute of Technology, are have been . under development for a decade, and include studies of other early . warning systems in Japan, Mexico and other quake-prone nations. Padilla estimated it would take $80 million to develop a statewide version of ShakeAlert through the California Emergency Management Agency, and $20 million more in annual operating . costs. 'But an investment like that is a no-brainer,' he said. 'If you think about the lives we can save, the injuries . we can reduce, and the billions upon billions of damages associated with . every large earthquake, the system would more than pay for itself.' The researchers say the scheme is now ready. 'We're ready to build it up right now,' said Richard M. Allen, director of the UC . Berkeley Seismological Laboratory. 'It's ready for prime time.' The system's test phases have proved . so successful that BART trains in San Francisco are already equipped to . stop instantly whenever the system flashes a hazard warning for the are, . Allen said. Lucy . Jones, senior adviser for risk reduction for the U.S. Geological Survey . (USGS), one of the monitoring network partners, said a lot of the . technology needed for the system is already in place. 'If we were building it from scratch, it would cost $650 million,' she said. California State Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Los Angeles, reaches to point at a graphic describing how an earthquake warning system might work, as Dr. Douglas Given of the U.S. Geological Survey watches . The California area's probability of suffering an earthquake . It would take from one to three years to fully launch the new system, Jones said. The system is based on a highly . sophisticated algorithm that can send out a signal from any one of the . 2,000 quake-detecting instruments now in place up and down the state. An alert would go out whenever the . system senses a temblor's first pulse of short shock waves - known as P . waves - that speed through the ground just as a seismic fault starts to . rupture. California has suffered a number of . major earthquakes, with a 1906 quake reducing much of the centre of San . Francisco to rubble in what is . considered the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. The . subsequent fire that engulfed the city left more than 3,000 dead and . thousands more injured. The Great Earthquake measured 7.9 on the Richter Scale as was felt as far away as Orgeon, Los Angeles and Nevada. This photo provided by the Museum of Modern Art shows a stereo image of San Francisco City Hall made after the 1906 earthquake and fire that devastated the city. Around 227,000 and 300,000 people were left homeless out of a population of about 410,000 and lead to refugee camps set up along the coast, which were still operational two years after the quake. The cost of the damage from the earthquake was estimated at the time to be around $400million, which is around $9.5 billion in today’s money.

The father of a deaf schoolgirl is threatening to sue his local council because they have failed to find his daughter a Welsh signing expert. John Clarke, 45, is furious because he believes his child Hafwen, eight, whose name means 'summer's beauty' in English, should be taught in the language they speak at home. Hafwen was born profoundly deaf and has until recently been taught at a Welsh-speaking school near Aberystwyth, west Wales, with a qualified signer helping her in class. But the signer retired and the local education authority has been unable to find a replacement despite advertising the post twice. Taxi driver Mr Clarke said: 'Hafwen has a right to be educated in Welsh - she has the same rights as able-bodied children. 'We're trying to do our best for our daughter, but it seems we are banging our heads against a brick wall.' When she was three, Hafwen started at Penrhyncoch Primary School, near Aberystwyth, where her parents, father and brother all went. The school provided her with a signer for four years but when that teacher left they could not find a full-time replacement.

A spokeswoman said: 'Despite advertising the post twice, including an advert in the local press, no one suitable was found to support the pupil. 'The authority has always maintained that it is willing to support the parents' choice of school which is Penrhyncoch and will continue to work with the school to find a suitably qualified teaching assistant.'

A Polish war hero with an incredible story of survival during World War Two has died aged 91. Flight Lieutenant Czeslaw 'Tony' Rogers braved a 830-mile trek on foot across the Soviet Union's frozen wastes to India after being freed from a prison camp before eventually making it to Britain. He then became a decorated Spitfire and Lancaster bomber pilot who flew daring RAF missions against targets in Germany. Lt Rogers, who adopted the English surname of his screen heroes Roy and Ginger, had fought in 1939 when his native country became a target for oppression following the non-aggression pact between Hitler and Stalin. The German Luftwaffe decimated the Polish air . fleet and pilots like Lt Rogers were handed machine guns and told to fight on . the ground - against German forces invading from the west and Russian . soldiers from the east. Lt Rogers was then taken prisoner by the Russians and sent to a gulag in Siberia. Best friend Gordon Scott-Whale, 85, of Fairford, Gloucestershire, recalled: 'In Krakow Tony told me he and his comrades hid inside graves at a cemetery. 'Can . you imagine firing at Russian tanks from inside a grave? One of his . friends was killed but Tony escaped and managed to make it back to his . village.' He was later arrested by the NKVD secret . police and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, deported in a cattle . truck which took three days to reach a prison camp in Siberia. Mr Scott-Whale said: 'There were women and children in . the trucks and whenever a child died en-route they just had to throw . their body out into the snow.' Following Hitler's invasion of Russia in 1941, . Stalin allied with Britain and America against the Germans. Prime . Minister Winston Churchill requested the release of Polish nationals . from Siberia - and Lt Rogers was one of them. Remembering what his friend had told him . about escaping from the gulag, Mr Scott-Whale said: 'They opened the gates of the . camp and told them to go. 'At . first they thought it was some trick and that they'd go out and get . shot. But off they went in groups of ten, on specially made sledges. 'In . Tony's group only he and another airman survived, the others just . collapsed in the snow. Scroll down for video .

Once in England, with his new . Anglicised name, Lt Rogers met Nan, a WAF driver, who would become his . wife and mother of their two children. During . the rest of the war he flew Spitfires for the RAF before being drafted . into Bomber Command to fly the Lancaster because of his experience in . Poland of flying twin engine aircraft. Lt Rogers flew the iconic Spitfire fighter plane when he joined the RAF in the 1940s (file picture) The Avro Lancaster bomber, shown during a Royal Air Forces Battle of Britain memorial flight, was another aircraft Lt Rogers piloted (file picture) He was in 138 squadron Special Operations (Moonlight Squadron) in the B Flight, based out of RAF Tempsford in Cambridgeshire. In 1944 he flew a supply mission into . Warsaw – in a Halifax or a Stirling – flying low to parachute down . supplies including arms, explosives and radio sets at a place where . lights flashed to indicate underground members. German . fighters were waiting for the planes to rise but they kept at low . level, but many crews were lost and the missions were stopped afterwards . for being too risky. Following the German invasion of Poland, many Polish pilots - a great number of whom had fought the Luftwaffe - escaped and made their way to France and Britain. In June 1940 the Polish Government in Exile formed a Polish Air Force in the UK, with two fighter squadrons - 302 and 303 - composed of Polish pilots and ground crews, with British commanding officers. The two fighter squadrons went into action in August. Most of the Polish pilots had hundreds of hours of pre-war flying experience and were among the most experienced in the battle. They had learned from combat experience to fire from close range. Between them the Polish pilots claimed 201 aircraft shot down. 303 Squadron, in which Brigadier General Tadeusz Sawicz served, claimed the highest number of kills - 126 - of all Allied squadrons in the Battle of Britain. The Polish War Memorial on the outskirts of RAF Northolt was dedicated in 1948 as a commemoration of the Polish contribution to Allied arms. Lt Rogers continued to serve in Bomber Command flying Lancasters, until his retirement from the RAF in 1948. His service log books highlight 12,000 flying hours in a variety of . aircraft types: Spitfires, Lancasters, Wellingtons and after war ended . Meteor jets. Before the war, Lt Rogers had originally wanted to become a doctor in 1930s Poland, but was attracted to a career flying aeroplanes by a friend of his brother, who was part of the pre-war programme to strengthen the Polish Air Force. In the early 1950s Lt Rogers and his family moved to Singapore, where he was the personal pilot to General Sir Gerald Templer, British High Commissioner in Malaya during the Communist insurgency. Mr Scott-Whale said: 'Tony would fly light aircraft such as the Auster to spot terrorist activity in the Malayan jungle so that the ground troops could move in and flush them out.' Lt Rogers won the RAF Air Crew Europe Star, the Defence Medal and the highest accolade of Polish medals, the Virtuti Militari. Gordon commented: 'In later life Tony would always be guest of honour at Battle of Britain memorial dinners at RAF Brize Norton, and sit at the top table with the Commanding Officer. 'He also met the Duke of Kent in 2002 at Fairford Air Tattoo, and last year met the Queen in London at the unveiling of the bomber command memorial.' Lt Rogers was eventually immobilised by a stroke and the RAF Benevolent Fund stepped in to provide a mobility scooter. He was so inspired by this that he went on to become a keen supporter of the RAF Benevolent Fund. In memory of his friend Gordon said: 'There are not so many of these chaps left now. Tony was a perfect friend and a wonderful man. I hope his story is not going to be forgotten.' Lt Rogers passed away on January 15 at Hyperion Nursing Home in Fairford, Gloucestershire.","Tony Rogers braved 830-mile trek on foot across Russia's frozen wastes .

A U.S. judge yesterday fined BP a record £2.5billion for its role in the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. The company agreed in November to plead guilty to charges involving the deaths of 11 workers in the April 2010 drilling rig explosion that started the spill. More than 200million gallons of oil spewed in the three months before BP’s blown-out Macondo well could be capped. It was one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. Up in flames: In this April 2010 photo taken in the Gulf of Mexico, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig is seen burning . A series of government investigations . have blamed the blow-out on cost-cutting decisions by BP and its . partners on the drilling project. BP . separately agreed to a settlement with lawyers for Gulf Coast residents . and businesses who claim the spill cost them money.  BP estimates the . deal will cost the company roughly £5billion. Lawyers . for BP and the U.S. Justice Department said the plea agreement imposes . ‘severe corporate punishment’ and will deter deep-water drilling . companies from allowing another disaster to occur. U.S. District Judge Sarah Vance said the plea deal was ‘just punishment’ considering the risks of litigation for BP and the alternatives to the . settlement. She told victims’ relatives who were . in court that she read their ‘truly gut-wrenching’ written statements . and factored their words into her decision. Damage: Oil saturates the beach in front of sandbags and booms in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, in May 2010 . ‘I’ve heard and I truly understand . your feelings and the losses you suffered,’ she said, adding that she . also believes BP executives should have personally apologised to family . members. 'I've heard and I truly understand your feelings and the losses you suffered' U.S. District Judge Sarah Vance, speaking to victims' relatives . ‘I think BP should have done that out of basic humanity,’ Judge Vance said. The . deal does not resolve the federal government’s civil claims against BP. The company could pay billions more in penalties for environmental . damage. The Justice Department has reached a . separate settlement with rig owner Transocean that resolves the . government’s civil and criminal claims over the Swiss-based company’s . role in the disaster. Transocean agreed to plead guilty to a . charge of violating the Clean Water Act and pay £890million in civil and . criminal penalties. There will be a hearing regarding that criminal . settlement next month. Remembrance: In this photo from April 2011, people gather near 11 crosses for the workers who died in the oil rig explosion and one for the Gulf of Mexico during a vigil to mark the first anniversary of the spill . Many relatives of rig workers who died in the blast submitted written statements critical of BP’s deal. Gordon Jones’s family members said BP’s sentence should include a personal, face-to-face apology to the 28-year-old’s widow and children by BP executives. A brother of Mr Jones also had urged Judge Vance to consider stiffer penalties that prohibit or limit the company’s ability to operate in U.S. waters. But Judge Vance said she couldn’t get involved in plea negotiations and only could impose a sentence that adheres to the agreed-upon terms if she accepted it.

Tens of thousands of small firms ‘cruelly conned’ by banks into taking out rip-off loans could get more than £10billion in compensation, it emerged last night. On another day of shame for Britain’s banking giants, the Financial Services Authority found them guilty of ‘serious failings’ over the sale of the complex ‘interest rate swap’ loans. Many deals contained an expensive ‘break clause’, which meant they could not escape the loan without paying a fortune to the bank. This could exceed 40 per cent of the value of the original loan. Scandal: Britain's biggest banks will potentially have to pay out billions to the victims of mis-sold interest rate swaps . Thousands of the loans were sold by . the country’s four biggest banks – Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank . of Scotland, both rescued by taxpayers, as well as Barclays and HSBC. Yesterday Business Secretary Vince . Cable said it is yet another ‘example of the little guy paying for the . big banks’ wrongdoing.’ Greg Clark, Financial Secretary to the . Treasury, said the victims had been ‘cruelly conned by the very people . they trusted’, with many sold loans by banks where they had held . accounts for more than 40 years. It is the latest in a long list of . banking scandals, the most notorious of which has been the £12billion . mis-selling of payment protection insurance. Hendersons . Alan Henderson has run his firm in Putney, south-west London, for 40 years. But it has been pushed close to the brink of collapse by a £1.75million loan which Mr Henderson, 73, feels he was ‘hoodwinked’ into taking out. The company has two businesses – Henderson Signs and Henderson Builders. Mr Henderson’s wife Margaret, 73, does the accounts, their daughter, Jane, 47, is the secretary and their son Mark, 50, runs the building business. Mr Henderson took out the loan with RBS in February 2008, and his first quarterly payment for around £22,000 was as expected. Within months, the loan repayments had risen to £34,000. The loan repayment had dropped to £11,000 but there was an extra payment of £23,000 for the ‘swap’. Furthermore, Mr Henderson would have to pay a ‘break cost’ of around £400,000 to get out of the loan. Mr Henderson said: ‘I do feel they hoodwinked me.’ They were told they had to continue paying the cost of the ‘swap’ for a further five years, even after the five-year loan ends because they had repaid it. Fortunately, RBS has recently suspended the payments following the investigation by the FSA. Criticism: The FSA claims that 90 per cent of the swaps were wrongly marketed to their buyers . Ever since the advent of the credit crunch and the financial crisis which has been blamed on banks' reckless lending policies, financial institutions have become wrapped up in a mounting succession of scandals. May 2011: After a long-running regulatory battle over Payment Protection Insurance, the big banks admitted they had misled their customers into buying unnecessary coverage and agreed to set aside up to £13billion to pay compensation to those affected. June 2012: Barclays was fined after its traders were found to have manipulated the Libor benchmark lending rate. The investigation was soon widened to take in a number of other banks. August 2012: Standard Chartered was accused of breaking sanctions banning trading with Iran, by hiding $250billion worth of transactions involving the pariah state. The bank was fined $340million by regulators in New York. November 2012: It emerged that HSBC had enabled criminals' money laundering by allowing them to set up offshore accounts in Jersey. The bank admitted its controls over laundering were too lax and was hit by another huge fine. Yesterday the City regulator slammed . the banks for ruthlessly taking advantage of small business owners, who . were persuaded to take out loans they did not understand. Many of the victims had no idea the . terms contained a stealth clause meaning it would cost them a fortune if . interest rates started to fall. Some of them have gone bust. Others . have been forced to make redundancies or ask staff to work for free, . while others are having to raid their pension and savings to keep . afloat. The FSA said it believes at least . 40,000 loans were taken out but does not know the exact number of small . firms affected. Some may have taken out more than one loan. Its initial investigation into 173 of . the loans found ‘over 90 per cent did not comply with one or more of our . regulatory requirements’. The compensation bill will be  huge, with estimates ranging from  £1.5billion to more than £10billion. The average compensation payout for . PPI from the Financial Ombudsman Service is £2,750 but the scale of the . compensation to small business owners will be far higher. In total, the four big banks have set . aside around £650million to pay compensation, but this is likely to be . just the start of the final bill. Matthew Fell, a director of the . Confederation of British Industry, said: ‘Giving businesses prompt and . proper redress will enable banks to then focus on lending to the real . economy.’ Mr Cable added that the immediate . priority is ‘to ensure small businesses are not driven out of business . by banks pursuing liabilities for swaps that they mis-sold’. The FSA said it found examples of the . cost of the ‘break clause’ ‘exceeding 40 per cent of the value of the . underlying loan’. Last year, when the scandal broke Tory MP Gary . Streeter said: ‘I think it will become as big a scandal as PPI.’ Banks have been ordered to complete . their reviews of their cases within six months, although those with . large numbers of victims are allowed to take up to 12 months. Jeremy Roe, of Bully Banks, described . the announcement as ‘a Polo settlement’ because it has a hole in the . middle – as it is unclear how much compensation will be paid. A century ago, Paul Adcock’s great-grandfather set up a shop in the high street of the Norfolk town of Watton. Now, thanks to a complex loan deal sold by Barclays, the family business is struggling under a massive debt. Speaking when the scandal came to light last June, Mr . Adcock said he felt angry at the way the bank, which has been the . firm’s ‘trusted adviser’ for 100 years, has treated him. In . 2006, he took out a loan for around £970,000 to make alterations to his . electrical shop, but he was advised to take out a swap to protect . himself against interest rate rises. Mr . Adcock, who has worked at the shop since he was 18, said that he had . no idea what he was taking out when an adviser from Barclays Capital . came to speak to him. When . faced with a barrage of questions from the adviser on his ‘predictions . on the future movements of interest rates’, Mr Adcock simply said: ‘I am . an electrical retailer. I sell televisions and washing machines.’ The consequences have been devastating. He estimates the swap has cost him around £185,000.Each . month, he is making payments of around £7,700 to Barclays, but most of . the money – around £4,500 – goes on the swap. The exact payments vary . each month. Mr Adcock, . whose brothers, Chris and Mark, also work for the business, says the . extra financial burden has crippled his business. He . has had to make two redundancies from his small team of staff. His . wife, Marion, 51, is retraining as a midwife to try to bring in another . source of income. The . shop, Adcocks of Watton, cannot sell a wide range of products . because they cannot afford to buy the stock, although his customers have . been extremely sympathetic. He said that running a small independent . retail store during a double-dip recession is obviously difficult, but . Barclays has made the situation far, far worse. ‘Having to fight the economic climate was always going to be tough,' he said. ‘But going into the battle with no ammunition [because of the swap payments] is really sickening.’ A Barclays spokesman said the bank was working with Mr Adcock to minimise the damage to his firm.","Financial Services Authority found banks guilty of 'serious failings'

A U.S. judge has rejected Apple's demand for a hike to the $1.05billion damages owed to it by South Korean smartphone rival Samsung in the two firms ongoing patent war. District Judge Lucy Koh also rejected demands from both firms for another trial over claims Samsung unfairly used Apple's iPhone and iPad technology in knock-off products. She also upheld the validity of the Apple patents at the centre of the dispute. Head-to-head: Samsung's Galaxy smartphone, left, and Apple's iPhone, right. A U.S. judge yesterday slapped down Apple's demand for an increase to the $1billion damages owed by arch-rival Samsung . A jury last August found that Samsung . 'infringed' six Apple patents to create and market 26 models of . smartphones and computer tablets and ordered the $1.05billion award. The jury found several other older Samsung products did not infringe any Apple patents. Earlier, Judge Koh refused to block . sales of the infringing products in the U.S. after she said Apple failed . to show demand for the Samsung devices was driven by the purloined . technology, including the 'pinch-to-zoom' function. Apple is appealing against that decision. Samsung contends that only three of the 26 older-generation products are still offered for sale in the U.S. Apple has filed a new lawsuit . contending that Samsung's current products are also using Apple . technology. Judge Koh scheduled a trial for that matter in 2014. In a series of four orders early today, the judge painstakingly considered each side's myriad claims that the nine-member jury wrongly considered evidence and misread complex patent law. Since Apple first took Samsung to the court in early 2011, Apple has been more successful in its U.S. litigation campaign, winning the $1.05 billion damage award and a pre-trial sales ban on some Samsung products. Samsung has since fought back and scored some favourable rulings, including yesterday's ruling that prevents any higher damages. The ruling also comes as investors worry Apple is losing its dominance in consumer electronics after it missed Wall Street revenue forecasts for the third consecutive quarter last week on weaker-than-expected iPhone sales. By comparison, Samsung, once seen as quick to copy the ideas of others, now sets the pace in innovation and widened its lead over Apple on the back of aggressive marketing of its wide product range last year. Shares in Samsung, the world's top smartphone maker by units shipped, closed up 2.2 perc ent on Wednesday in Seoul, beating a 0.4 per cent gain in the wider market. With a few minor exceptions, the judge concluded that the jurors were right as far as the law goes. 'Accordingly, the trial was fairly conducted, with uniform time limits and rules of evidence applied to both sides,' the judge said. 'A new trial would be contrary to the interests of justice.' The judge is still considering Samsung's demands to reduce the $1.05billion award. The jurors had filled out a verdict form listing damages Samsung owed Apple for each of the 26 products it ruled used infringing technology. Samsung argues that many of the line-item calculations were done incorrectly and that it was due a big reduction in the award. Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet declined to comment and a Samsung spokesman did not respond to emails. At a hearing in December, the judge seemed inclined to rework at least a few of the jury's damages calculations, but gave no indication by what amount. The world's top two smartphone makers, Apple and Samsung and are locked in a no-holds-barred, global battle for supremacy of a market worth $346billion a year. Lawyers for both sides have appeared in courts around the globe accusing each other of stealing technology and trade infractions. International Data released a report on Friday showing smartphone shipments soared 36 per cent worldwide in the fourth quarter as the sleek devices supplanted personal computers and other gadgets on holiday shopping lists. Samsung Electronics retained its bragging rights as the smartphone leader, shipping nearly 64million devices for a 29 per cent share of the global market. Apple ranked second with nearly 48million iPhones shipped during the fourth quarter, translating into a market share of 22 per cent.","Judge Lucy Koh also rejects demands for a fresh trial in the patent dispute as 'contrary to the interests of justice'

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:39 EST, 30 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:41 EST, 30 January 2013 . A jury on Wednesday convicted a priest and teacher in a pivotal church-abuse case that rocked the Philadelphia archdiocese and sent a church official to prison for child endangerment. The verdict supports accounts by a 24-year-old policeman's son that he was sexually abused by the Rev. Charles Engelhardt and sixth-grade teacher Bernard Shero in about 1999, when he was 10 years old. The accuser's 2009 complaint describing abuse by two priests and the teacher led to Monsignor William Lynn's landmark conviction last year for endangerment. Lynn is serving three to six years in prison for his role transferring an admitted pedophile priest to the accuser's parish in northeast Philadelphia. Former teacher Bernard Shero walks from the Criminal Justice Center in Philadelphia. A jury on Wednesday convicted Shero of rape, indecent sexual assault and other charges . The young man said the abuse started after Engelhardt caught him drinking altar wine in fifth grade. He said Engelhardt told fellow priest Edward Avery about their 'session,' prompting Avery to twice sexually assault the boy. And he said Shero raped him in a car a year later, after driving him home after detention. The jury convicted Shero of rape, indecent sexual assault and other charges, and Engelhardt of indecent assault of a child under 13, corruption of a minor and conspiracy with Avery. The jury deadlocked on one count, an indecent sexual assault count against Engelhardt. Defense lawyers argued that details of his story defied belief, and said the troubled young man was simply looking for a payout from his pending civil suit against the archdiocese. 'OK, so he sued the archdiocese,' Assistant District Attorney Mark Cipolletti argued to jurors Friday. 'Who can blame him? ... No dollar amount could fix this, and never could.' Defense lawyers attacked the credibility of the accuser, who has battled a heroin addiction since his teens, and gave varying accounts of where and how the alleged abuse occurred. The alleged victim said the abuse started after Rev. Engelhardt (left) caught him drinking altar wine. He said Engelhardt told fellow priest Edward Avery (right) about their 'session,' prompting Avery to assault him twice . He told the social worker he'd been raped for five hours by Engelhardt after Mass; beaten and tied with sashes by defrocked priest Edward Avery; and raped by Shero at school. '(He) is the walking, talking personification of reasonable doubt,' argued defense lawyer Michael McGovern, who represents Engelhardt, a 66-year-old Oblate of St. Francis. The accuser's account got a boost when Avery entered a surprise guilty plea last year. But Avery startled the courtroom this month when he testified that he never touched the accuser, saying he took the plea to avoid a longer sentence at trial. The young man said Shero raped him in a car for five hours after driving him home after detention . A lawyer for Shero, 49, described his visually impaired client as an easy target who had been taunted by classmates growing up and by students as an adult. That portrait led Cipolletti to wonder aloud why he went into teaching. Reminding jurors of the big picture, McGovern urged jurors to resist the 'groundswell presumption of guilt throughout this country' when priests are accused of molesting children. Thousands of people have accused priests around the country of abuse, but the complaints were routinely locked in secret archives. Several states, including Pennsylvania, then extended the time limit for child sex-abuse victims to pursue criminal or civil action, although victim advocates want to see additional reforms. Philadelphia prosecutors saw their chance to renew their exhaustive, but stalled, investigation into priest abuse with the policeman's son, whose claims were viable under the new statutes. District Attorney Seth Williams decided to charge Monsignor William Lynn, the former secretary for clergy at the archdiocese, with child endangerment because Avery had been transferred to the boy's parish even though he admitted to church officials that he had abused a boy previously. Lynn was convicted in the landmark case in June, and is serving three to six years in prison. He is appealing his conviction. In September, Kansas City Bishop Robert Finn was convicted of a misdemeanor for failing to report a priest known to possess child pornography. The victims' advocacy group Bishopaccountability.org recently began posting the secret church documents aired at the Lynn trial. And the Archdiocese of Los Angeles was forced to make many of their secret archives public. 'The Philadelphia archive will show why statutes of limitations must be reformed in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and why Lynn and Finn will not be the last church officials to be held accountable,' Bishopaccountability officials said.","Rev.

All Nippon Airways (ANA) is the biggest customer for the Dreamliner, with 17 of the jets in . its fleet, and was forced to cancel 459 domestic and international flights at a cost of around £9.1million ($15.4million). Now a senior executive at the airline, Asia's largest by revenue, has announced it is prepared to claim from Boeing . whatever damages it suffers from flight cancellations and other costs . caused by the worldwide grounding of 787 jets. Losses: All Nippon Airways Executive Kiyoshi Tonomoto says the company will seek redress from Boeing after its Dreamliner fleet was grounded by safety concerns . ANA was a launch customer for the Dreamliner and has 17 of the total of 50 planes in existence . Chief Financial Officer Kiyoshi Tonomoto said the airline was focused on investigating the cause of the 787 battery problems, and it was not yet in damage negotiations with Boeing. He also said efforts were focused on minimising flight disruptions and revenue losses by using other aircraft. 'But we will negotiate with Boeing,' Tonomoto added. 'We are now focusing on assuring safety for our customers.' Boeing is under increasing pressure . after it emerged the plane manufacturer knew of previous problems with . the batteries yesterday. ANA said it . had to replace the batteries on its 787 aircraft ten times because they failed . to charge properly or showed other problems.

Airlines spokesman Sze Hunn Yap declined to be more specific on when . units were replaced or whether these were reported to authorities. Adding to the pressure on Boeing, U.S. innovator and entrepreneur . Elon Musk, who is the founder of Tesla car company, told British . aerospace journal Flight International that the batteries were always faulty. He said: 'Unfortunately, the pack architecture supplied to . Boeing is inherently unsafe.' All 50 of the Boeing 787s in use around the world were grounded following two incidents with the batteries earlier this month. First, there was also a battery fire in a 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport on January 7. Then on January 16, an ANA flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Japan when its main battery overheated. There were also reported incidents of faults with fuel leaks and problems with the braking system. Following the revelations about the previous problems with the batteries, Boeing was ordered to provide a full operating history of the batteries used in its 787 Dreamliners. The National Transportation Safety Board in the U.S. made the request after becoming aware of the previous incidents. Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said Wednesday the U.S. manufacturer is sticking with plans to speed up 787 production and sees no reason to drop the lithium-ion batteries. Airlines have been replacing 787 batteries at a rate that's 'slightly higher' than Boeing had expected, but they were being replaced for maintenance reasons, not for safety concerns, he said. McNerney said 'good progress' is being made in finding the cause of the problems, but didn't have a timeline for when the plane would get back in the air. The damaged battery case from a fire aboard a Japan Airlines (JAL) Boeing 787 Dreamliner airplane at Logan International Airport in Boston earlier this month . Tonomoto said ANA revenue will be eroded by about three per cent for this fiscal year ending March 31 if the 787 services can't be resumed, but that will translate to minimal impact on profit. Such losses will be gradually reduced over coming months, he said. 'It is not small,' Tonomoto said of the 787 impact. 'But it is not that great.' The Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries. They charge faster and can be better moulded to space-saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries. Lithium-ion batteries are prone to overheating and require additional safeguards to prevent fires.","ANA says the grounding of its fleet caused hundreds of flight cancellations .

'Not everyone. Sir David Attenborough is a guest and in the f****** building. Revise your opinion,' Ross responded, adding: 'You left the country and left me to deal with it (Sachgate). We're going to get in trouble again. I don't earn as much as I used to thanks to you, you f*****.' Back to joking: The pair discussed how the scandal had brought them closer as friends as a result - the only good to come out of it . The pair caused a national scandal in 2008 when they left smutty messages on veteran actor Andrews Sachs's answerphone during a pre-recorded Radio 2 show. Jonathan Ross said that Brand had sex with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie. It led to the departure of the Radio 2 station controller, and both Brand and Ross left the BBC as a result of the fallout. Speaking during his chat show Ross said: 'Let's deal with this, because we're both keen to put this behind us. People, I think are perhaps curious as to how we felt about it afterwards. 'We did both regret the furore that we caused, and also the hurt it may have caused Mr Sachs and his family.' 2008:  In an on-air prank actor Andrew Sachs (left) was left stunned by the 'joke' voicemail messages where Ross said that Brand had slept with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie (right) As they were: The pair were colleagues broadcasting on BBC Radio 2 before they caused the uproar .

'I consider myself quite a polite person right, but sometimes you get excited when you're doing a joke. 'I'm doing the joke, and I think 'this is brilliant, this is brilliant' and then you sort of realise, 'oh that's reality with real consequences.'

'Russell and I went through an unusual experience together and even though we're both embarrassed by what we did, that's fair enough - but at the same time, the only genuinely nice thing that came out of it for me was the fact that we became very close,' he said. But Brand then ribbed him: 'You said you'd do it again, let's call . up other treasures of British comedy.

'I'd occasionally chat to her a little bit but you know what it's like if you know someone that's got a drug and alcohol problem, it's really hard if they're not ready to help them along. 'When she died it made me feel like you've got to do something, it's so unnecessary,' he said. But he joked to Ross: 'You're not invited, you can't be trusted.' Other acts on the bill for the concert - to be screened by BBC3 - include Jimmy Carr, Noel Fielding, Frankie Boyle, Emeli Sande and Jessie J. It's not yet known which parts of the pre-record will be included in the final edit of the show. The Jonathan Ross Show is screened on ITV1 on Saturday at 9.45pm. What did he say this time?

From her big blonde bouffant hair to her statement bright lips, Dolly Parton has perfected her signature look throughout her years in the spotlight. And while she's now one of the most successful female country artists of all time with an estimated 177 million in album sales, she didn't always have access to the best beauty products when she was growing up in Tennessee. In her new memoir entitled, Dream More, the 66-year-old country crooner shares the unusual beauty tricks of her past. Dolly Parton has admitted the secrets to perfecting her signature look as a teenager in her new memoir . She said: 'Until I was a teenager, I used red pokeberries for lipstick and a burnt matchstick for eyeliner. I used honeysuckle for perfume. 'We were raised in the Pentecostal Church of God and they believed that wearing makeup was sinful. 'My Grandpa Jake, my Mama’s dad, was a preacher. So I had to sneak around and make myself look all pretty but then wash it off before they caught me.' Things weren't always as glamorous for the successful country singer, who used to have to scrub her make-up off so her family wouldn't see her wearing it . The largely unfamiliar pokeberry originates from a genus of plants known as Phytolacca native to North America, South America, East Asia and New Zealand. They are actually poisonous if not cooked properly but fearless Dolly loved the deep red look on her lips, as they say: beauty is pain.","Used poisonous pokeberries as lipstick and honey suckle for perfume when growing up in Tennessee .

Parents should avoid leaving children under five unsupervised in front of the TV, the creator of Jackanory and Play School warned today. Joy Whitby, 82, who launched the BBC shows in the Sixties before working at ITV, is worried about ‘the glutting amount for children from early morning six till six’. The Oxford history graduate, who gained a job on Play School after writing about how the Watch With Mother slot could be refreshed, said she was saddened by today’s ‘noisy, meretricious cartoons’. Concerns: Joy Whitby (pictured second left at a London Weekend board meeting in 1969), now aged 82, is worried about 'the glutting amount for children from early morning six till six' ‘If I had a child under five at home again, I wouldn’t want to leave him in front of the television set unsupervised if I could possibly help it,’ Ms Whitby told the Daily Telegraph. She said small children should not be ‘endlessly watching’, adding: ‘I have been to houses where that happens and I am horrified, because I think “I’m not sure you’re watching anything worthwhile”.’ Ms Whitby claimed the proliferation of children’s TV content during the day has resulted in a 'total loss of the sense of occasion’ and youngsters can’t look forward to a show they can get all the time. She did praise the Horrible Histories series on CBBC but told the Daily Telegraph that the worst programmes on TV nowadays ‘exploit stereotypical characters’ and have ‘no real story’.

The producer added that she has always been an ‘elitist’ and never enjoyed ‘audience-pulling shows’ which she only watched ‘out of duty, not pleasure’. She said the industry had witnessed a huge change since the ‘old protective, uncommercial approach to children’s programming’.

When Craig Parkinson had thousands of pounds worth of equipment stolen from his farmyard, the police took a statement, gave him a crime reference number, and drew up a list of the missing items. But when a week later they appeared no nearer to catching the culprit, Mr Parkinson decided to take matters into his own hands. The farmer and part-time mole catcher logged onto internet auction sites and searched first for a pressure washer similar to the one that had been stolen. Farmer Craig Parkinson, left, traced thief Christopher Taylor, right, after Taylor put his stolen goods on eBay . £15,000 haul: When Lancashire police raided Taylor's home, they found goods from several other burglaries . Not only did he find someone trying to sell a model identical to his, but when Mr Parkinson clicked on the seller's other photographs, he saw boxes of his stolen gear lined up in the background. After duping the seller into agreeing to a viewing, Mr Parkinson carried out a secret reconnaissance of his property - then handed over his dossier of information over to police. Officers acting on Mr Parkinson's information raided the home of Christopher Taylor in Southport, Merseyside and arrested him and recovered the stolen goods. Inquiries revealed he had carried out 15 other raids. During the raid officers found items worth around £15,000, including two expensive mountain bikes, that had been stolen from more than a dozen West Lancashire farms. This week Taylor, 27, was jailed after admitting burglary at Liverpool Crown Court. Father-of-two Mr Parkinson, who owns a flock of 60 sheep and runs a separate mole catching business in Tarleton, Lancashire said: 'I was delighted to get the stuff back but I was very disappointed in the initial police reaction. This image shows the van used by Christopher Taylor to steal goods from Craig Parkinson's Lancashire farm. Valuable farm equipment: Christopher Taylor was caught after he advertised the goods for sale on the internet . 'They go on about rural crime killing business in the countryside and I agree with them, but it seemed they weren't taking this burglary seriously enough. 'I'm sure what I did is no different to the old days of victims of burglary going round the second-hand shops to see if their stolen stuff is up for sale. But I do wish police would do their bit more too. 'I'm sure that if I had not done what I did, I probably wouldn't have got my stuff back.' Mr Parkinson discovered around £4,000 of machinery and stock had been stolen from one of his outbuildings in an overnight raid last September. Among the items taken were tools, fencing and containers. He initially reported the theft to Lancashire police but lost patience when they had not tracked the thief down, and decided to do some digging for himself. Within minutes of logging on to eBay, he saw his Ryobi pressure washer being sold by a man in Southport.  Other photographs posted by the vendor showed boxes of farming equipment stolen from Mr Parkinson's farm piled up in the background. DIY detective: Craig Parkinson traced his stolen goods himself after he says the police failed to find the thief . Taylor's lawyer said he was unemployed and in financial difficulties when he stole the farming equipment . Mr Parkinson said: 'I couldn't believe the gall of him when I saw pictures of my stuff for sale. 'In the pictures, I could even see the rest of my stuff in boxes in the background. I said to my wife, Eve: ""Come and look at this, it's unbelievable!"". 'It was amazing that all of my stuff had been stolen and just days later I could see it all brazenly up for sale on the internet. I certainly didn't hold out much hope that I would ever see any of the items again but there it all was.' 'I rang the police to tell them about my lead and yet no one called me back. I was so worried I might lose my lead I sent the seller a message on eBay saying I was interested in buying the pressure washer. 'Amazingly he sent me a message back saying it was fine to take a look and gave me his address so I could come and view it.' Mr Parkinson then staked out the house, noting down vehicle registration numbers of cars coming and going from the property and trying to see if he could spot any of his stolen items. Another image of the vast array of goods stolen by Christopher Taylor, who is now in jail after admitting burglary . He printed out all of the pictures from eBay and gave them to Skelmersdale CID with his other information. He added: 'I told them ""That's all of the evidence, now go out and arrest them"". 'It wasn't particularly difficult what I did; I was just so frustrated that no-one in the police seemed to be taking the case seriously.' 'I was really disappointed in the police but mainly I just wanted to stand up for small businesses. I didn't think that they were taking the burglary seriously so I took matters into my own hands. 'To me £4,000 is a lot, and I know that most of the time victims of crime like this don't get the stolen items back. 'I'm pleased he's been caught: these yobbos need to know that their behaviour is not acceptable.' At Liverpool Crown Court Taylor was given a five-month prison sentence plus an additional eight months after inquiries revealed he carried out his raids whilst under a suspended jail term for wounding. His lawyer Michael Hagerty said Taylor had been unemployed and in financial difficulties at the time of the offences. Sgt Steve Monk, from Lancashire Police, said: 'The warrant was issued after we received community intelligence. We are always grateful for this and do rely on local residents helping us to fight crime.'","Farmer Craig Parkinson, 48, found the man who raided yard on the internet .

"By . Tamara Cohen . UPDATED: . 03:13 EST, 29 November 2011 . If you hate rummaging for change when you’re ordering that morning coffee, help is at hand... or thereabouts. Today sees the UK launch of a range of hi-tech watches that can pay for a double-shot espresso, a newspaper or a host of other small purchases with a flick of the wrist. They contain a chip similar to a mobile phone’s SIM card that allows you to settle up by tapping the watch on a special terminal at the till. Hi-tech: The Watch2pay range of gadgets will allow wearers to top up the devices and make payments of up to £15 . The ‘watch2pay’ gadgets follow the successful introduction of Quick Tap, a similar system that allows payments using mobile phones, earlier this year. Available in eight colours, the watches cost £99 and can be used at 70,000 shops in the UK, including chains such as Pret A Manger, Subway, McDonald’s and Oddbins, as well as various independent cafes and newsagents. Rather than debiting your bank account, they can only spend the money you have topped it up with online – and if the watch is lost or stolen, your account can be cancelled on the phone or over the web. At first they will only be able to make payments of up to £15, but this limit may be extended depending on their popularity. MasterCard, which has teamed up with . watchmaker LAKS for the project, said its devices could help people to . stick  to a budget, as there is no overdraft  facility, or be used to . give children their pocket money. The manufacturers say their watch is more convenient than a Quick Tap smartphone, as it is never tucked away in a pocket or bag. A spokesman said: ‘We think it will be popular because it takes out the fumble factor – you don’t have to rummage through your pockets to find it. ‘You could use it for your child’s pocket money, or go out for a jog and buy some water without taking your phone out. ‘Some people may feel uneasy about using their phone for everything in case it gets lost, so this offers an alternative, which looks like a normal watch.’ Some experts believe that cash could . become obsolete within a few years, as so-called ‘tap and go’ technology . becomes more widespread and more people use their phones to make . purchases, leaving their notes and coins behind. A survey of major retailers by online . payments firm PayPal last week even suggested that children born today . will be the first cashless generation. Budget: MasterCard, which has teamed up with watchmaker LAKS for the project says the devices could help prevent people from overspending . Carl Scheible, the managing director of PayPal UK, said: ‘We’ll see a huge change over the next few years in the way we shop and pay for things. ‘By 2016, you’ll be able to leave your wallet at home, and use your mobile as the 21st-century digital wallet. ‘The lines between the online world and high street will soon disappear altogether.’ However, despite this prediction, many of us appear reluctant to part with traditional payment methods. In July, banks and retailers abandoned plans to abolish the cheque by October 2018 following a public outcry.","New high-tech watch contains chip that allows you to settle payments by tapping it at the till .

A jewellery designer whose body was found in his burning home had been violently attacked before his death. Michael Griffiths, 59, was left with serious injuries to his head and body before he was found by firefighters on Thursday morning. Detectives have launched a murder inquiry and expressed fears that he may have been targeted because of his work as a jewellery and with antiques. Injuries: Michael Griffiths, 59, whose body was found in his burning home in Fernhurst, West Sussex, suffered serious injuries to his head and body . Murder: Police have launched an investigation, saying there is 'no doubt' that he was murdered . It is understood that Mr Griffiths lived alone at the house in Old Glebe in Fernhurst, West Sussex, and was on his own in the property at the time of the fire. The 'talented' designer was described as a 'well-known and popular' man. A post-mortem examination carried out yesterday by a Home Office pathologist failed to establish a cause of death but police said there 'is no doubt' that he was murdered. Investigators said a suspicious seat of fire was found near a window in the lounge at the back of his building. Detectives also said that two windows appeared to have been opened before the fire broke out. Detective Chief Inspector Jeff Riley, who is leading the Surrey and Sussex major crime team, said: 'On Thursday evening, fire investigators advised us that they were suspicious of a seat of fire close to a lounge window at the rear of the house. 'Smoke patterns on a couple of the windows suggest that they were open when the fire broke out. 'The post-mortem has revealed that Mr Griffiths suffered serious injuries to his head and body, but at this stage it is not possible to firmly conclude that they were the cause of his death. Target: Police are investigating whether Mr Griffiths, who worked with antiques and as a jewellery designer, was targeted because of his professional activity . Alone: It is understood that he was alone in the property when the incident occurred on Thursday morning . He added: 'Michael was a well-known and popular local man who was a talented jewellery designer and maker and was an enthusiastic antiques buyer and seller. 'I am considering that this may have led to him, or at least his home, being specifically targeted and this forms one of our main lines of inquiry at this time. 'There is no doubt that we are dealing with a murder and I would appeal to everyone in Fernhurst's close-knit community to think about anything suspicious or just out of the ordinary in the days leading up to the fire and especially the time between 6.30 and 8am on Thursday morning, to give us a call.' It emerged that Mr Griffiths was visited by callers who threw snowballs when he answered from an upstairs window. at about 8.25pm on Tuesday . The police said the incident may well have been 'an innocent prank' but said they wished to speak to anybody who had experienced a similar experience. Forensic investigators are still examining the house today and are expected to remain at the scene for a few days. Their work was being hampered by fire damage, with some of the upstairs area needing to be made safe before their investigations can continue. Anyone with information is asked to call Sussex Police on 101, quoting Operation Killick, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Michael Griffiths, 59, suffered serious injuries to his head and body .

It is a sexual quixotic quest that has . frustrated couples for decades. The illusive G-Spot has proved an enduring mystery - sparking debate among doctors, some of whom claim the idea of the G-Spot is a myth. But now, for those who can locate their G-Sport, help is at hand as it is revealed that the sex lives of couples worldwide could be enhanced dramatically thanks to a single jab. The vaginal sub mocosal hylauronic acid injection - or G-Shot - claims to improve women's sex lives by pumping filler into their G-Spot. And now an Essex clinic reports a 50 per cent boom in bookings for the surgical procedure, suggesting it really works. The jab, which costs £550, temporarily increases the G-Spot's size to that of a 10p coin. Dr Lucy Glancey, of Grancey Medical in Essex. has been performing this operation for five years. In the first three years she performed approximately 60 procedures and in the last two years she has seen a 50 per cent increase, with approximately 90 cases completed. The G-Shot has an expected longevity of six months. Dr Glancey said she gets inquiries from younger women who do not need the procedure and see it as a fashion trend, but she doesn't perform the procedure on them, deeming it 'unnecessary'. Her usual clientele, who do benefit from the jab, include women in the 35-50 age group who have either given birth, changed with age or have embarked on a new relationship, perhaps with a younger man.

But the clinic also warns patients of the possible risks associated with the procedure. These include infection, urinary retention, painful intercourse, a 'sensation of always being sexually aroused' - or no effect at all. Along with all those risks, though, comes the hope of increased frequency and intensity of orgasm, especially for those who have not experienced vaginal orgasm before.

Some women report the G-Spot leads to powerful orgasms . The GräfenberG-Spot, often called the G-Spot, is defined as a bean-shaped area of the vagina. Some women report that it is an erogenous zone which, when stimulated, can lead to strong sexual arousal, powerful orgasms and female ejaculation. The G-Spot is typically described as being located one to three inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) up the front (anterior) vaginal wall between the vaginal opening and the urethra and is a sensitive area that may be part of the female prostate. Although the G-Spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location. A 2009 British study concluded that its existence is unproven and subjective, based on questionnaires and personal experience. Other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-Spot in women who report having orgasms during intercourse. It is also hypothesised that the G-Spot is an extension of the clitoris and that this is the cause of vaginal orgasms. Sexologists and other researchers are concerned that women may consider themselves to be dysfunctional if they do not experience the G-Spot, and emphasise that it is normal not to experience it.

Parents are making their children commute over huge distances as they engage in an 'arms race' to get their children into the best private schools. The 'madness' of trying to secure places at top schools is 'writing off two years' of childhood, warned the headmistress of one of the UK's top preparatory schools. Jane Grubb, head of Dunhurst - the prep school attached to Bedales senior school in Hampshire - said that drilling young children for entrance tests has an adverse effect on them.

She described the situation, in which some children commute for 10 hours a day to attend fee-paying schools, as a 'bunfight'. Many parents will not send their children to local secondary schools after having attended prep schools as they do not think they are good enough, she said. Alumni: The school boasts a number of famous faces as alumni, including Daniel Day-Lewis, pictured,Kirstie Allsopp and Sophie Dahl . Mrs Grubb said that the pressure often starts when children are eight, with children spending two terms doing practice papers by the age of 10 in an effort to gain entry to top schools. She said that parents in London should send their children to boarding schools outside the capital, rather than engaging in lengthy commutes for a limited number of private school places. Mrs Grubb told the Evening Standard: 'I dread to think of the impact it has on children. Parents genuinely want them to be happy but they need to put their heads . up and see what other life there is. 'The 10 hours they spend commuting . could be spent getting more sleep or seeing their friends.' 'I can’t imagine parents want their children studying into the night and . having personal tutors and writing off two years of their childhood. But some do because they don’t know there is something else out there.' Bedales, charges £30,000 a year for boarders, and £21,000 for those attending the prep school. The school boasts a number of famous faces as alumni, including Daniel Day-Lewis, Kirstie Allsopp and Sophie Dahl. Her comments come as a collection of 13 Buckinghamshire grammar schools is backing a 'tutor-proof' 11-plus exam to be introduced this autumn.

Investigation: Hackers were trying to find files on an investigation into Chinese premier Wen Jiabao's $2 billion fortune . Chinese hackers attacked the New York Times’ computer system and stole every employee's password after its investigation into Premier Wen Jiabao’s  $2 billion fortune, it was claimed today. The gang reportedly side-stepped the newspaper's security systems over several months in a bid to track down files relating to Prime Minister Mr Wen and his family's impressive wealth. The New York Times said that experts hired to deal with the security breaches found that the hackers routed the attacks through computers at U.S. universities, installed a strain of malicious software associated with Chinese hackers and initiated the attacks from university computers previously used to attack U.S. military contractors. Security breaches began in September, the same time that the paper began its investigation. Hackers managed to steal passwords of every Times employee and 53 computers were hacked into, according to Foxnews.com. Their attempt to access the files was unsuccessful however as the Times confirmed that all of the investigation folders had remained protected. Experts are unsure how the hackers initially managed to infiltrate the newspaper's systems. Executive editor Jill Abramson said: 'Computer security experts found no evidence that sensitive e-mails or files from the reporting of our articles about the Wen family were accessed, downloaded or copied.' But when approached by the paper, the Chinese Defence Ministry warned that allegations of hacking against the country without solid proof is 'unprofessional and baseless.' The Times is not the first to claim hacking by the Chinese. The U.S Government along with several other foreign nations and computer experts have all accused Chinese hackers of launching widespread cyper-spying campaigns in a bid to uncover sources and to stop negative stories about the country. Hacked: The New York Times office in Manhattan. The newspaper has reported that its computer system was breached by Chinese hackers . Greg Walton, a cyber-security researcher who has tracked Chinese hacking campaigns, said: 'Attacks on journalists based in China are increasingly aggressive, disruptive and sophisticated.' Executives had become concerned about security when Chinese officials warned them of unspecified consequences before they published their investigation into Wen Jiabao on October 25. The company that monitors its computer systems then confirmed activity consistent with hacking. The Chinese premier is thought to have been very embarrassed by the New York times story regarding his wealth back in October. The article described how the Prime Minister's mother, siblings and children amassed their affluence and prompted the powers-that-be in the Communist state to block the newspaper's website both in English and Chinese. Searches for the publication's site as well as the names of Mr Wen's family members were also barred on the country's main microblog service with the Chinese government describing the feature as a 'smear'. The article stated that the family of Mr Wen, 70, known for his humble background - his mother was a teacher and his father tended pigs - had accumulated most of their assets since Wen was named vice premier in 1998 before his promotion to Prime Minister nine years ago. The estimate of his family's wealth was made according to a review of corporate and regulatory records from 1992 to 2012. New York Times reporter Chris Buckley was forced to leave the country following the article after authorities failed to renew his medical documentation.","The paper claims that hackers were looking for files from its investigation into Mr Wen's family wealth .

"By . Alice Smellie . PUBLISHED: . 16:31 EST, 27 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:32 EST, 27 October 2012 . It was third time unlucky for Andrea Nunn. Eight years ago she twisted her knee jumping out of a horse box. Four years later she hurt it again while walking her dog. Each time, Andrea limped for a few days but didn’t go to hospital. However, on the third occasion in spring last year she knew it was serious. ‘I was standing up from putting washing in the tumble dryer when I heard an almighty bang in my knee and I doubled over in agony,’ she recalls. Andrea, 35, had become a victim of one of the most common injuries suffered by Britons. Every year one in 600 people damage or rupture their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), one of the four ligaments that stabilise the knee joint. Over the agony: Six months after the 'origami' surgery to her knee, Andrea Nunn can ride her horses again . Traditional treatment involves grafting two hamstring tendons – from the three that run down the back of the leg – into the knee joints to replace the ACL. The drawback is that it can significantly reduce the strength of the leg. Now an operation called the Translateral All Inside technique for ACL Reconstruction is transforming the prospects of patients, reducing recovery time and increasing leg strength. It has also been dubbed the origami technique as it involves folding over just one hamstring tendon four times to make it stronger. The knee is the largest joint in the body. The thigh and shin bones form a hinge joint, and the patella, or knee cap, sits over them and slides as the leg moves. The ligaments are crucial to this structure. These are strong, fibrous cables of tissue connecting the bones. The anterior cruciate ligament runs diagonally from front to back within the knee. One of the major problems with ACL injury is that it is often not picked up until the problem is severe. ‘The injury tends to occur on the sports field – playing football, hockey, netball or rugby,’ says Mr Adrian Wilson, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at North Hampshire Hospital, Basingstoke. ‘Damage is usually caused by a twisting movement, such as changing direction suddenly. Many people go to accident and emergency but 90 per cent of the time  an X-ray comes back clear so they are sent home.’ Although the swelling goes down, the patient often sees a GP within a few weeks because of continuing pain. ‘They . may or may not be referred to a knee specialist, but by the time they . get an appointment they are five or six months down the line,’ says Mr . Wilson. ‘Should they be fortunate enough to be referred for a repair, by . the time the operation is performed it may have been 18 months since . the original injury.’ Not only will patients have been in a great deal of pain but they may also have suffered irreparable damage to the knee joint – including cartilage tears and joint-surface damage. ‘An operation will halt the process of deterioration and stabilise the knee,’ says Mr Wilson. ‘Left untreated, patients will eventually need a knee replacement.’ Mr Wilson’s new technique, which he developed mainly at North Hampshire Hospital with his NHS team, uses just one hamstring tendon. He says: ‘Taking two significantly reduces hamstring strength and it takes a year to recover. Our technique takes half the time to recover. Everyone limps for a few weeks, but after six months our patients are pretty much back to normal.’ The operation takes about an hour under general anaesthetic. First the surgeon makes a keyhole incision about 2in below the knee on the inside. Through that, a long spear-like instrument is inserted and used to cut a single hamstring from the bone at either end. ‘We used to make a large incision from knee to groin to locate and take out the hamstring,’ says Mr Wilson. ‘But we have found that by cutting the point that anchors the tendon to the bone, we can slide the hamstring out. It’s a flat ribbon, about 1cm wide and 0.5mm thick – a bit like pappardelle pasta.’ Next, the surgeon removes the broken ACL and drills a socket where it once attached to either side of the knee joint. ‘The hamstring is folded four times, a bit like origami, and stitched together to make it very strong,’ says Mr Wilson. ‘Sutures are attached at either end, and these are fed through a thinner tunnel a couple of millimetres in diameter, then anchored to the outside of the knee with little buttons.’ Mr Wilson has performed it on more than 150 patients and interest in the technique is growing globally. Andrea is one of the lucky few to have benefited so far. After her collapse in the spring, her boyfriend, Jamie Whitehorn, 47, who works in IT, drove her to hospital. Andrea says: ‘They said there was nothing broken and gave me a metal brace which reached from ankle to thigh. I was in agony. Even after a week, I’d walk a few steps and my knee would wobble.’ A physiotherapist she saw a fortnight later referred her for an MRI scan. ‘I had to wait two months for this, and then a further seven for the operation.’ During this time Andrea wore the knee brace constantly. ‘I couldn’t walk far. To hold the knee straight it had to be fastened tightly so it was very uncomfortable.’ Normally very active – riding her two horses daily, cycling to work and walking her dog – Andrea says she lost a stone through muscle-wastage. ‘My life changed. Everything I took for granted had gone. I felt depressed,’ she admits. When she heard of Mr Wilson’s operation, she decided to go for it. ‘I met someone who had undergone the old operation and they were left limping. I just wanted to get back to normal. After the operation, I felt no pain at all and was on my feet within 12 hours. The knee felt solid and firm and I could walk with crutches.’ Although she was absent from her office job for two weeks, Andrea was able to spend the following month at work with her feet up on a box of files. ‘My boyfriend looked after the horses and walked the dogs, but I’ve been riding again for a few weeks now and it’s fantastic to be back in the saddle,’ she says.","Andrea Nunn had 'origami' surgery to her knee after damaging a ligament .

A steam train enthusiast was crushed to death when a train took off in the wrong direction while he was standing behind it, trapping him between two carriages. Retired police officer Robert Lund, 65, died almost instantly from 'extreme' chest and abdominal injuries, an inquest heard today. He had been helping a fellow volunteer uncouple carriages at Grosmont station, when he signalled for the driver to take off. Scroll down for video . Inquest: Retired police officer Robert Lund, 65, died almost instantly after the incident at Grosmont station, an inquest at North Yorkshire Coroners' Court heard today . But the locomotive unexpectedly moved off in the wrong direction, North Yorkshire Coroners’ Court  was told. Mr Lund, was working as a guard on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, when the incident took place on May 21 last year. It is thought Mr Lund, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, returned to the area between the carriages before he was struck. Norman Ash, who was driving the S15 . steam locomotive, said it was possible he did not lock a . reversing lever into place, which could have allowed the locomotive to . slip between forward and reverse. Enthusiast: A steam train pictured on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, where 'enthusiast' on which Mr Lund worked as a guard . The retired professional train driver with more than 50 years’ experience, said: 'I turned round to see which way was I was going and the next thing I knew I was going the opposite way. 'I slapped the emergency brake on. I . was more concerned we were going to collide with the coaches we’d just . come off. I never even thought about Mr Lund going back between the . coaches. He added: 'There was no impact at all. At that point the fireman said to me, ‘is the guard on your side?’. I said no.' Mr Ash said he got off the footplate, adding: 'I found Mr Lund trapped. All I can remember is seeing his legs dangling down from between the coaches. That’s all I could see.' He said there was no way of freeing Mr Lund so he contacted the signalman and told him to call the emergency services. 'The next thing I knew, the operations manager Mr Hugill came out'” he said. 'I think he shouted, ‘Bob, Bob’, a few times but there was no response.' Mr Ash said they moved the train to release Mr Lund before paramedics and police arrived. Pathologist Nigel Cooper said Mr Lund died of chest and abdomen injuries. He added: 'The injuries indicated an extreme crushing force. The internal injuries were very severe. I think death must have occurred very quickly due to the severity of the injuries.' Accident investigators said the incident was 'highly unusual' and experts had re-enacted some of the events to figure out what happened. Both Mr Lund and Mr Ash were both very experienced railwaymen in whom the investigators had complete confidence, Chris Hall, of the Rail Accident Investigation Board, told jurors. He said Mr Lund would have had 'no reason to believe' the train would change direction, which was most likely caused by the driver forgetting to lock the reverse lever. 'If it was the case that he didn’t apply the latch, it is probably a case of simple forgetfulness that all human beings are capable of,' Mr Hall added. The inquest will resume tomorrow, when the jury will be sent out to consider its verdict.

Drivers are willing to put themselves in danger rather than pay expensive bills for repairs, the Post Office revealed, with nearly half of motorists in their 20s skipping routine checks. Worryingly, one in seven drivers admits they let their tyres wear down to dangerous levels while one in 10 cannot be bothered to fix faulty windscreen wipers. The study found that people were taking to carrying out repairs themselves to cut the high cost of taking their car to the garage and 12 per cent of people used general car parts rather than those produced by their vehicle's manufacturer. Paul Havenhand, head of travel and insurance at the Post Office, said: 'Ignoring a small problem which could . be easily repaired will not make it disappear, and could result in the . cost escalating with time. 'Failing to maintain your car could lead to it being deemed unroadworthy. 'Even more importantly, it could make the car dangerous on the roads and put both the driver and others at risk.' According to the study men are three times more likely to have a go at fixing the problem themselves whereas women are more likely to ask a friend or relative. The problem is worst in the North West of the UK with nearly a third of motorists putting off services despite advice that cars should be checked once a year or after a certain number of miles.

A series of TV adverts by the now disgraced pop DJ Jimmy Savile was used to popularise the catchy road safety message of ‘Clunk-Click every trip’ to a generation of drivers. Car manufacturers have had to install seatbelts since 1965 but the law requiring drivers to wear them did not come in to force for another 18 years. In 1991 the law changed again making it a legal requirement for adults to wear seatbelts in the back of cars. The legislation is credited with saving thousands of lives but IAM chief executive Simon Best says the message has yet to hit home with many drivers – particularly those aged between 17 and 34 who have the lowest compliance rate. Campaign: Mandatory belt use by children came into force in 1989 and rear seat belt wearing became compulsory in 1991 . More modern: The Government encourages safer driving through its THINK! campaign which seeks to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents . ‘In the past three decades, seatbelts . have made a fantastic contribution to road safety success in Britain, . helping to save thousands of lives,’ he said. 'Unbelievably, there are still some people who do not use a seatbelt - my message to them is simple: a seatbelt could save your life and not wearing one is just not worth the risk' Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond . ‘Younger drivers know that not wearing a . seatbelt is dangerous but they must still be reminded that, no matter . where you are sitting in a car, a seatbelt will save your life.’ The IAM says 14 per cent of adults . confess that they do not always wear a seatbelt and 19 per cent know . someone who doesn’t use one in the front. Thirty-six . per cent of people aged between 16 and 29 know someone who does not do . so compared to 11 per cent of those aged 55 or over. Mandatory belt use by children came into force in 1989 and rear seat belt wearing became compulsory in 1991.

The on-the-spot fixed penalty doubled from £30 to £60 in 2009 and the Department for Transport last year considered a further increase to £90. But official casualty figures . attribute a failure to wear a belt as a contributory factor in 220 . deaths and serious injuries each year. Kevin . Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of . Accidents said: ‘It is astonishing that some people still don’t do . something as basic as putting a seatbelt on. Shocked: Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said he found it unbelievable that there are still some people who do not use a seatbelt . ‘We are concerned that there are fewer police out there since the spending cuts and we have not seen as much publicity about the need to wear seatbelts. ‘It is a message that needs to be continually repeated and refreshed.’ Road . Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘Thousands of lives have been . saved and countless injuries prevented over the years because drivers . and passengers were wearing seatbelts. ‘The combination of effective enforcement and hard-hitting public awareness campaigns mean that, thirty years on, the vast majority of drivers and passengers buckle up when they get in their cars. ‘But, unbelievably, there are still some people who do not use a seatbelt - my message to them is simple: a seatbelt could save your life and not wearing one is just not worth the risk.’ The Government encourages safer driving through its THINK! campaign which seeks to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents by providing high quality, clear road safety advice for everyone who uses the roads. To celebrate 30 years of seat-belt legislation, the Government is making a selection of historic THINK!  Road safety adverts available online.","Institute of Advanced Motorists: 5% of 37m motorists flout seatbelt law .

It was created as a way of mobilising the population again and while the boom for the tiny mode of transport only lasted around a decade the mini-car has come to embody the post-war spirit. Mr Weiner's collection includes the iconic Peel P50 and a one-off BMW bubble car which has been transformed into a 730bhp drag car. But the classic car collector has now decided to sell his entire fleet . He has enlisted RM Auctions to sell the collection over the weekend of February 15 at the Bruce Weiner Microcar Museum in Madison, Georgia. One of the star lots is a 1964 Peel P50-  the world's smallest ever production car  and expected to sell for $45,000 (£29,000).

'My collection has brought me incredible joy over the years, but simply finding and restoring these cars is not enough for me. In order to fully appreciate them, I need to share them. 'I'm really looking forward to the sale and happy that these unique cars will be spread to other passionate collectors throughout the world.

The original bubble cars appeared on Britain's streets in the 1950s and 60s as a solution to post-war material shortages and the need to 'get the nation back to work'. There was high-demand for the tiny cars after the 1957 Suez Crisis sent fuel prices rocketing sky high. The BMW Iso Isetta was the first one ever produced when it went into mass production in 1955. The 7.5ft by 4.5ft car took over 30 seconds to reach 30mph - and had a top speed of just 47mph. The petrol tank held just 13 litres although that was enough to travel more than 150 miles. But with the arrival of the Austin Mini in 1959 - a tiny vehicle that could carry the whole family - the bubble car slowly disappeared from Britain's roads. The bubble cars were impractical for travelling long distances. Jeremy Clarkson squeezed his 6ft 5in frame into one of the tiny vehicles on Top Gear last year. And television's glamorous Holly Willoughby has been filmed taking one for a spin on the way to the X-Factor studios.","Fanatical Bruce Weiner has spent the past 15 years fastidiously scouring the world buying up hundreds of the finest microcars .

Looking like something devised for a grisly horror movie, this crude saw is being used to amputate the fingers of criminals in Iran. In a series of photographs released by the country’s state news agency, a blindfolded man is led to the machine where two hooded men put his hand in a vice. Another turns a handle which operates a circular saw that guillotines four of the man’s fingers. Brutal: Iranian authorities have released pictures of their crude finger amputation machine . Crimes: The man was found guilty by a court in the southwestern city of Shiraz of theft and adultery . His bloody hand is then held up before being dipped in raw iodine. Incredibly, the man’s face reveals no pain, suggesting he may have been drugged. The man was found guilty of theft and adultery by a court in the south-western city of Shiraz last week and his punishment was meted out under sharia laws. Following the amputation, a public prosecutor said that such punishments for criminals would become more severe in an announcement seen as a warning before June’s elections to replace President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has served his maximum two terms. Mahmoud Amiry-Moghaddam, a spokesman for Iran Human Rights, said: ‘I believe this is a strategy to instil fear in the population so as to avoid any protests.’ Last week, at least 15 journalists were arrested in what Sherif Mansour, of the Committee to Protect Journalists, described as part of a ‘never-ending effort to brand critics as enemies of the state’.

Fear: Experts fear over-50s, driven on by fiction such as Fifty Shades of Grey, might find themselves picking up sexually transmitted infections when they embark on new partnerships . A deluge of mummy porn has inspired women of all ages to seek more adventurous relationships. But while many in their 30s and 40s are well versed on the risks of sex, the older generation are said to be woefully ignorant. A wave of ‘silver separations’ has led to a boom in older people playing the dating game – many of them fitter and more active than counterparts from past decades. Experts fear this group, driven on by fiction such as Fifty Shades of Grey, might find themselves  picking up sexually transmitted infections when they embark on new partnerships. The FPA, formerly the Family Planning Association, said older people are dating with little idea about how things have changed. Acting chief executive Audrey Simpson said: ‘Early in their relationship older couples should be talking about going for a sexually transmitted infection test… they need to be aware they are equally at risk as young people.’ She told The Times that older people who have been through divorce ‘are . entering the dating scene with little idea about how things have . changed. ‘They are likely to know even less about sexual health than young people, who have been the target of services and campaigns,' she said. Analysts believe longer life spans mean older people - many of whom grew . up during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s - have greater . interest in sex and a higher likelihood of changing partners at . increasingly higher ages. Latest figures show that divorce and cohabitation are on the increase among older people. In 2001 there were 3,693 women aged 60 or over who were divorced, a number well below pension-age divorce in the early 1980s. But last year the level had risen by 58 per cent to a record 5,836. Dating: Figures suggest that an increasing number of 'silver separations' is leading to older people entering the dating game . Among men over 60, divorce numbers went up by 43 per cent from 6,580 to 8,539. Numbers of husbands over 60 divorcing are higher because men typically marry at older ages than women. Older people are shown to be increasingly likely to fall victim to divorce alongside some other risky age groups. The greatest number of divorces came among husbands and wives aged between 40 and 44 - broadly those who are between seven and a dozen years into their marriage. The risk has long been picked out by the phrase ‘seven year itch’. The FPA warning came as the group, together with sexual health organisation Brook, published a report which said that 2.3 million women are facing restrictions on the availability of contraception. It warned that limits on contraceptive availability could cost taxpayers £110billion (sub: billion correct) by 2020 in extra costs on the NHS for abortion, maternity and child health, and for education and state benefits for children produced by unwanted pregnancies. In 2011 there were 8,000 people aged between 35 and 44 known to have the STI chlamydia - up 9 per cent in five years, but fewer than 4,000 45 to 64-year-olds, though this is up 13per cent since 2008. Fewer than 2,000 people between 45 and 64 had gonorrhoea, though that is up 41 per cent in five years, and only just over 600 had syphilis, about the same as 2008. Numbers of over-65s known to have STIs are negligible.","Experts fear older people may pick up sexually transmitted infections .

A grandmother died from bowel cancer after being repeatedly told she only had constipation, her daughter revealed today. Widow Maddy Pratt-Hooson, 66, went to her local GP surgery twice a week for six months complaining of severe abdominal pains. But each time she was told not to worry and sent back home to her bungalow in Newhaven, East Sussex where she lived alone. Scroll down for video . Maddy Pratt-Hooson, 66, was rushed to hospital in the middle of the night after calling her daughter Laura Hooson (l) in agony. Pictured with her granddaughter Jenny, 9 (r) Mrs Pratt-Hooson, a mother-of-three, was eventually rushed to hospital in the middle of the night after calling her daughter Laura Hooson in agony. It was another ten days before she was diagnosed with bowel cancer, which had started in the colon - and less than four weeks later she died from a massive tumour. Bowel cancer is sometimes called colon cancer or rectal cancer depending on where it starts. Symptoms include blood in your stools, an unexplained change in your bowel habits like prolonged diarrhoea or constipation and unexplained weight loss. It is the third most common cancer in the UK with around 41,000 new cases in 2009. Around three quarters of cases develop in the over-65s. Those with a close relative who had the disease are at much greater risk. People are at higher risk if they eat a diet high in saturated fat and low in fibre. Obesity, lack of exercise, a high alcohol intake and smoking can also increase the risk. Currently everyone aged 60 to 69 can be screened by sending a tiny stool sample in the post. This will soon be extended to the age of 75. Within the next few years everyone will also be offered a camera examination of their lower bowel at the age of 55. Laura, 24, said: 'She was failed by the NHS in every aspect - doctors, hospital, everything. 'She saw various doctors at her local surgery for six months but no-one properly examined her at all. 'She even saw out of hours doctors at the hospital but they all kept telling her she had constipation. 'One night she rang me in the middle of the night, crying her eyes out, and we got an ambulance to her and she ended up in hospital. 'That was on October 1st but it wasn't until the 11th - another 10 days - before she was diagnosed with colon cancer. 'By then we were told that nothing could be done for her apart from keeping her comfortable. 'She came home for a couple of weeks but her final days were spent in a hospice as she went downhill fast and she passed away on November 5th. 'She suffered unnecessary pain and distress for the last seven months of her life due to NHS negligence and I think the public should be informed.' A prolonged unexplained period of constipation can be a symptom of bowel cancer. Mother-of-one Laura, from Brighton, East Sussex, said she had tried to sue the NHS on her mother's behalf but was told she was not allowed because she was over 18. She is now consulting solicitors to see what other options she has.","Maddy Pratt-Hooson, 66, went to her GP surgery twice a week for six months but was told not to worry .

A father described how his 14-year-old boy lay dying in his arms after a 'freak wave' swept him from the family's boat onto its spinning propeller. England under-15 hockey star Charlie Hutton was killed in a horrific motorboat accident during a seaside break with his parents and two of his closest school friends, an inquest heard today. His devastated father Simon Hutton, 52, who was driving the boat, told how he had desperately fought to save the teen's life. He sobbed as he described how he cradled his son - an Olympic 2020 hopeful - who had seemed 'very calm' in his last moments. Charlie Hutton, 14, suffered horrendous injuries when he was swept on to a propeller by a freak wave . Charlie was flung from the front of the £50,000 boat as it was hit by a 'huge' wave and suffered horrendous injuries as he was struck by the propeller of the powerful 200 horsepower Mercury engine. Mr Hutton, who was hit in the face by the five foot 'wall of water', described how he screamed out for his missing son after they were 'engulfed' by a huge wave, and suddenly his son and one of his friends had disappeared. He spotted Charlie's friend, who had been sitting on a cushioned area at the front of the boat with Charlie, bobbing around in the water. But his son was nowhere to be seen - until he realised he was lying wounded on the boat's propeller. Simon Hutton wept as he described how he cradled his son after the accident . The group, who were staying at the Hutton family's second home in Mudeford, Dorset, for a few days, had headed towards the Isle of Wight before tragedy struck near the The Needles landmark shortly before 5pm. After a day at the family beach hut in Mudeford, they planned to make the short voyage to Yarmouth for dinner and return in the early evening. Mr Hutton, who has a Royal Yachting Association motorboat certificate, told the inquest how he frantically tried to resuscitate his son after hauling him back into the boat. Graphic designer Mr Hutton, who bought the Cobra 6.6 rigid inflatable boat in 2010, said: 'I remember screaming out: ""Where's Charlie, Where's Charlie?"" 'I could not hear anything or anyone. My mind was blocked and I was set on finding Charlie. 'I saw what I thought was engine oil in the water and realised it could be blood and I went to the back of the boat. Charlie was there on the propeller. 'His eyes were fixed on me and they were just saying ""Help me"".' He had to rip the boy's shredded trousers from the blades of the propeller to free him while Charlie's other school friend, also 14, dialled 999. Mr Hutton, from south Croydon, Surrey, added: 'I cradled Charlie in my arms and rested him across the three seats. 'His eyes were open and he was looking at me as water kept splashing over the side of the boat. 'His trousers were torn, as was his flesh. 'He was conscious and breathing and his eyes were fixed on me. 'I told him that I loved him, that we all loved him. It seemed ages before the helicopter arrived but I know it was not. 'Charlie's eyes were starting to roll and his eyes were glazed. The Olympic 2020 hopeful died of multiple injuries, including wounds to his pelvis and left leg . 'I pushed down on his heart a few times but the pulse where my hands were was getting slower. 'By the time the coastguard crew arrived he had stopped breathing. 'The lead paramedic told me to do 30 compressions and two breaths, which I did. 'Within minutes he and Charlie were winched off the boat. 'At one point I remember the pulse in his leg had slowed and I think he died at this moment.' Mr Hutton and Charlie's two school friends waited for an RNLI lifeboat to come for the other injured boy, who had fractured his fibia and broken his toe. Mr Hutton, who has two older sons with wife Gill, then lit a flare so the lifeboat could find them easily. Recalling the moment the wave struck, Mr Hutton added he could not work out how Charlie landed on propeller. Charlie, who attended the £14,424 a year Whitgift school in South Croydon, was declared dead at 5.35pm in A and E at Southampton General Hospital, the inquest in Newport, Isle of Wight heard. A post mortem revealed he died of multiple injuries, including to his pelvis and left leg. 'I told him that I loved him, that we all loved him' Simon Hutton, Charlie's father . The previously fit and healthy teen also suffered wounds to his groin and extensive blood loss from the main artery to his leg, the inquest heard. Mr Hutton, who has been sailing since he was 12, was wearing a kill cord to cut the engine at the time of the incident. He said he thought it was safe to let the boys sit at the front of the boat, where it was 'bouncy and fun', the inquest heard. All four occupants of the boat were wearing buoyancy aids or life jackets and the boys knew to hold onto the boats ropes, Mr Hutton said. Mr Hutton said he remembered thinking the boat was coping well in the 'fairly choppy' waters and had slowed down from about 25 - 30 knots. Charlie's friend, now 15, recalled how the pals had spent the day at the Hutton's beach hut in Mudeford, before setting out and said Mr Hutton had been sailing sensibly. The other boy, from Reigate, Surrey, said he was 'flung back' against his seat as the wave hit. He then helped Mr Hutton pull Charlie back into the boat. Isle of Wight Coroner Caroline Sumeray recorded a verdict of accidental death and praised Charlie's friends for their 'great maturity and courage'. She said she had looked into the issue of propeller guards to boost safety on boats but that any recommendation she made would be 'meaningless'. Instead she called for publicity and information to make the public aware that they are available. 'That would be a fitting legacy for Charlie', she said. Charlie played for the England under-15 team and had ambitions of playing for Britain at the 2020 Olympic Games.","Charlie Hutton was flung on to a propeller as he was on boat trip with his father and friends .

Court case: Darius Ashard, 21, who played Snoozy the dwarf in panto was sentenced to 40 hours unpaid work for aggravated vehicle taking and handling stolen goods . An actor who played Snoozy the dwarf in a pantomime starring Priscilla Presley screamed 'I'm going to die' as he and his friends led police on a terrifying high-speed car chase, a court heard today. Darius Ashard, who was in a production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs this Christmas, had been a terrified passenger in a Vauxhall Astra taken in a burglary. The 21-year-old was arrested in August last year after police found him holding a stolen laptop and an iPad taken from a home in Woodford Green, Essex. But since then he has 'rubbed shoulders' with Ms Presley, 67, who starred as the Wicked Queen at the New Wimbledon Theatre, and was given rave reviews. Prosecutor Nadeem Holland told Snaresbrook Crown Court the stolen Astra had hit a red light and then took the wrong exit on the busy North Circular road. The car then sped in . the direction of oncoming traffic, causing other drivers to swerve out of the . way, and forcing police to give up the chase in case someone was killed. But soon after the gang jumped out of the car they were caught with Ashard left holding the stolen goods. Daniel Jerome, defending Ashard, said: 'He spent two months working . at the Wimbledon Theatre in the pantomime Snow White and the Seven . Dwarfs, with Priscilla Presley as the leading lady. 'He has rubbed shoulders with all sorts of famous names and being . part of the cast has given him a window into other potential work in . that field. 'He was asked by his co-defendants if he could look after a bag containing stolen property. 'He realised there was something untoward but out of goodness to his friends, he said yes. 'As soon as the vehicle started being driven in an undesirable fashion, . he expressed his wish to leave but he didn't have a choice until it came . to a stop.' Ashard was handed a 12-month community order with 40 hours unpaid work. The stolen car was first spotted after a raid in St Anthony's Avenue, Woodford Green, Essex and weaved through traffic to avoid the police. It was driven by James Howsen, 22, who is already serving a . five-month sentence for attempting to escape the dock at a previous . hearing last year, when he admitted aggravated vehicle taking and . driving without insurance. Panto: Ashard spent Christmas alongside Priscilla Presley and Warwick Davis , which his defence team said convinced him he could forge a career as an actor . Big hit: The dwarves in the panto, led by Willow and Life's Too Short star Warwick Davies . He was handed a six-month prison sentence and ordered to pay a £200 . fine, as well as being disqualified from driving for a year and given six penalty . points. Passing sentence, Judge Joanna Korner QC said: 'The course of driving outlined by the prosecution was dangerous in the extreme. 'You could have caused the death and or serious injury of a number of other people and indeed, you could probably have killed yourselves. 'Both of you knew this car was stolen and you, Ashard, none the less got in the car and added to your offences by taking possession of goods which you admitted you knew perfectly well were stolen. 'In your case, Ashard, you have lost your good name and that may have an impact on your future. 'In your case, Howsen, it seems to be the continuation of conduct that has been going on for some years but I take the view there is some hope for you. 'This is your last chance.' Nathan Pearce, 21, who was also a passenger, will be sentenced at a later date for aggravated vehicle taking and two counts of burglary.

Certain cosmetic procedures can be administered by practitioners who aren't medically trained . Patients undergoing cosmetic surgery should not be given false hope and told they will look better after treatment, medical experts have warned. Under new guidelines issued today, anyone providing treatment will have a duty to manage a patient's expectations and not imply they will feel ‘better’ or ‘look nicer'. Instead, they should use unambiguous language like ‘bigger’ or ‘smaller’ to . describe what that patient is trying to change. They should not imply that having treatment will . improve a patient’s psychological wellbeing. The guidance has been issued by the Royal College of Surgeons, who are urging the Government to make . the rules compulsory. It also states that only surgeons should provide cosmetic surgery and only doctors, dentists and nurses who have undertaken appropriate training should provide non-surgical cosmetic treatments such as Botox. Currently certain cosmetic treatments can be administered by anyone, anywhere with no medical training. The guidelines state that as standard . practice, practitioners should discuss relevant psychological issues . (including any psychiatric history) with the patient to establish the . nature of their body image concerns and their reasons for seeking . treatment. The new professional standards for cosmetic practice, as the guidance is known, also states that bargains and offers should be banned. The college is urging ministers to make . the rules compulsory as a review into regulation of cosmetic surgery . prepares to report in the spring. Professor Norman Williams, President of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), said: 'We have serious concerns that not all . those who offer cosmetic procedures are adequately qualified, or that . patients are getting accurate information prior to treatment.' Instead, the guidelines state that anyone considering treatment should have a 'stringent psychological assessment' beforehand. Pre-procedure discussions should include . the disclosure of relevant psychiatric history such as eating disorders . and the practitioner should document any signs or symptoms of Body . Dysmorphic Disorder. Currently, non-surgical procedures such . as laser treatments or injectables can be administered by people with no . healthcare qualifications whatsoever. At-home cosmetic procedure parties should be banned, leading doctors have said. So-called 'Botox parties' or 'filler . parties' - where groups of friends gather to receive the treatments at . home - are 'wholly incompatible' with professional standards, the Royal . College of Surgeons (RCS) said. Treatments should only be carried out . on licensed premises with resuscitation equipment readily available in . the event of an emergency, according to new RCS guidance. Many companies offer 'at home' cosmetic treatments, with special discounts for the event host. But the RCS said such parties are entirely at odds with the standards set out in its new Professional . Standards for Cosmetic Practice. The RCS recommends that only . licensed doctors, registered dentists and registered nurses who have . undertaken appropriate training should provide any cosmetic treatment. Only those who have qualified as a medical doctor and undertaken . post-graduate surgical training should carry out invasive procedures . such as breast surgery or liposuction. Professor Williams added: 'While the Colleges and professional organisations involved in cosmetic practice are neither regulators nor legislators, the profession has a responsibility to provide standards to which we would expect our members to work. 'We hope these standards will feed into the ongoing review of the industry led by the NHS Medical Director, Sir Bruce Keogh, and improve quality of care for patients going forward.' Steve Cannon, chairman of the working party which developed the guidance, added: 'As the majority of cosmetic procedures are not available on the NHS, we must ensure that commercial interests do not compromise patient safety. 2012 figures released yesterday by the British Association of Plastic Surgeons revealed that women had: . Breast enlargments:  9,854 . Eyelid surgery 6,071 . Face/neck lift 5,324 . Breast reduction 4,217 . Nose job 3,228 . Tummy tuck 2,882 . Fat transfer 2,641 . Liposuction 2,638 . (Figures for BAAPS surgeons only) 'With the demand for cosmetic surgery and non-surgical treatments rising year on year, it is crucial that the highest level of professionalism is maintained amongst practitioners.' The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons said the new guidance was a 'step in the right direction' but called for more stringent recommendations on cosmetic surgery advertising. Baaps president Rajiv Grover said: ""The marketing and advertising of cosmetic procedures is neither educating nor informing, but an exercise squarely aimed at achieving sales. This clearly puts economics ahead of patient care. Dr Tony Falconer, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), added: 'In the case of female genital cosmetic surgery, the majority of procedures are undertaken in the private sector with little regulation. The demand for cosmetic surgery is increasing, however, there is little evidence on its long term effects. 'We are concerned about the growing number of young women opting for cosmetic gynaecological surgery as under the age of 18 the external genitalia may still be developing. 'Both women and gynaecologists should be aware of the variation that exists in genital appearance and think carefully about exploring the idea of surgery if it is not clinically necessary.'","Practitioners should not imply patients will 'look nicer' or feel 'better'
Should instead use unambiguous language like 'bigger' or 'smaller'
Patients should also have psychological screening before treatment .

Dragon: TV star and technology entrepreneur Peter Jones has struck a deal with the administrator of Jessops . Dragons' Den investor Peter Jones has struck a deal with the administrator of Jessops to keep the brand alive. The technology entrepreneur, who owns internet specialist Phones International, has been locked in discussions over the terms of the deal and an announcement could be made as early as today. This month accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers took the unusual step of almost immediately closing all of Jessops' 187 stores triggering the loss of up to 2,000 jobs. Sources close to the discussions said Jones, who also owns technology website Expansys, is mainly interested in the brand but he could snap up some of the more profitable stores. Administrators were appointed after it became clear Jessops had effectively run out of cash. The chain, which can trace its roots to 1935, suffered tough Christmas trading, as consumers shift away from using cameras to smartphones which have their own high-quality cameras. The high street faces a watershed year as families cut spending amid the cost-of-living squeeze, as well as the increasing shift to shopping online. The administrator has said Mr Jones is among a 'number of buyers' to have bought assets from Jessops, although it is not clear how much he has paid. The assets bought include its intellectual property and remaining stock, according to The Telegraph. A spokesman for the administrator said: 'We can confirm that we have sold the brand and certain other assets to a number of buyers including entrepreneur Peter Jones.' Turnaround group Hilco is also thought to have bought assets from Jessops. The group, which took control of HMV by buying its debt, is believed to be looking into the possibility of installing Jessops concessions in HMV stores.

The country's Socialist party leader Ivica Dačić was midway through a discussion about Balkan politics when the young woman, wearing a short mini dress, uncrossed her legs to reveal she wasn't wearing any underwear. The YouTube video, a clear copy of the famous scene starring Sharon Stone in the 1992 film Basic Instinct, has already had 2.7million hits. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Mocked': The prime minister of Serbia has now launched an investigation into the television prank . Censored: A close-up shot reveals the presenter's wardrobe indiscretion but fortunately her lack of modesty is censored for the viewers . Amused: The Prime Minister stumbles over his words but cannot avoid a cheeky smile . 'The whole case will be fully investigated,' Dačić's national security adviser, Ivica Toncev, was quoted as telling the Serbian daily Blic. 'This was Serbia being mocked, not the prime minister. The prime minister's office will not let this go unpunished,' said Toncev. His office did not respond to requests for comments on the interview or the investigation. The episode, set-up and filmed by a private Serbian production company, was not aired and the trailer for its prank television show Nemoguca Misija (Mission Impossible) was removed from its website. Copycat: The stunt was a clear attempt to recreate the famous scene, starring Sharon Stone, in the 1992 film Basic Instinct . The interviewer, a former model from Croatian Playboy, said Dačić was a 'real man'. 'I have only good words for the prime minister,' Blic quoted 35-year-old Branka Knezevic as saying. 'He is strong and sturdy, a real man for that position. He's exactly who should lead the country.' Serbs were divided over the clip which commentators said reflected the dubious mix of politics and low-brow pop culture in Serbia, a phenomenon that emerged during the wars and sanctions of the 1990s as federal Yugoslavia collapsed. 'He handled it well,' said 28-year-old Belgrade clerk Dejan Perovic. 'He's a man, and no man could remain emotionless in such a situation.' Pensioner Olga Mijatovic was less impressed. 'It was contemptible,' she said. 'It was humiliating both for Dačić and the country and he should have banned it immediately and dismissed his entire public relations team.' Dačić, 47, is also Serbia's interior minister and was formerly the spokesman for late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic during the bloody 1990s collapse of Yugoslavia.

Sex symbol: Gina Lollobrigida has pledged says her former fiance should be jailed for the 'fake' marriage he is said to have orchestrated . Gina Lollobrigida yesterday pledged to have her former fiance jailed for the ‘fake’ marriage he is said to have orchestrated. In an exclusive interview the legendary actress described Spaniard Javier Rigua as a ‘vulture’ out to get his hands on her £35million fortune. Miss Lollobrigida, 85, made headlines this week after it emerged she had complained to Italian police that Mr Rigua, 51, had used fake documents to carry out a wedding ceremony ‘by proxy’. He has insisted the marriage was completely bona fide. Speaking to the Mail from her villa on the outskirts of Rome, the actress once dubbed ‘the most beautiful woman in the world’ claimed Mr Rigua was waiting for her ‘to die’. She said: ‘He is not guilty of just one fraud but of many. He is not a nice person. He will pay for what he has done. ‘I knew nothing about this until I did some research on the internet. He invented a false document to carry out this wedding and now he will pay. I will not rest until he has been brought to justice. He is nothing but a vulture, circling me, sniffing my blood. He married me and was waiting for me to die so he could inherit my possessions.’ Miss Lollobrigida – who starred with Humphrey Bogart, Burt Lancaster and Sean Connery in several films during the 1950s and 60s – revealed that she went to the police with her manager after inviting Mr Rigua to Rome to discuss the situation. She said: ‘I didn’t go into the full details otherwise he would never have flown over from Spain. I refused to meet with him when he arrived and instead my manager went to a police station with him. ‘I made the complaint to them and the police questioned Javier for several hours before letting him go. The matter is now an international investigation and I want justice. I want him to pay for what he has done. I will see him in court for what he has done.’ In her statement to Italian police, Miss Lollobrigida said her former boyfriend had carried out the 2010 fake ceremony in a Barcelona register office with a woman named Teresa standing in for her. She said he was able to carry out the wedding because he had obtained the legal right to act on her behalf. However, she claims she was tricked because all the documents were in Spanish. Javier Rigua's lawyers have disputed the claims and insisted everything is above board and legal . Miss Lollobrigida said: ‘I found all this out completely by chance. ‘To think when I first met him I thought he was polite and educated, I even defended him from gossips but now I see that all his good manners were simply superficial. ‘He would escort me to parties and we would be seen at all sorts of events together. 'At the time I was very depressed as I had been the victim of two other frauds so it wasn’t a very pleasant time for me. Javier helped cheer me up and I eventually decided to marry him. 'But then I travelled to New York to see some friends and after talking with them I changed my mind and told him I had decided that I didn’t want to get married anymore. But he obviously went ahead with it and I only discovered it by chance. ‘When this comes to court he and all his accomplices will go to jail. ‘He has had the help of many others to carry out this fraud. He was just waiting for me to die so he could have everything I own.’ The couple had met at Monte Carlo in the 1980s and they were together for more than 20 years before splitting up. She said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I read on the internet that I was supposed to have married him. ‘There were even witnesses at the ceremony.’ The mystery deepened further last night after Mr Rigau’s lawyers disputed her claims and insisted everything was legal and above board. Teresa Bueyes said it was ‘impossible’ the actress did not realise  she was married to the Spaniard and claimed Miss Lollobrigida had travelled to Barcelona in August 2010 to sign a legal document agreeing to marry Mr Rigau by proxy, adding that it was signed in front of a notary. Italian film legend Gina Lollobrigida with her former boyfriend Javier Rigau in 2006 . She said the marriage, celebrated without the actress present on November 29, 2010, was ‘completely legitimate’ and ‘took place with the full knowledge of both participants’. She also insisted that Mr Rigau had signed a document rejecting any inheritance from her on her death. Since retiring from the silver screen Miss Lollobrigida divides her time between Rome and Monte Carlo, making the odd appearance on Italian TV chat shows.","Actress says Spaniard Javier Rigua is out to get his hands on her £35million fortune .

It was a great year for patriotism with both the Olympics and the Diamond Jubilee taking place. And it would appear the spirit of national pride extended to British cinemas last year as new figures have revealed huge success at the box office for UK films. Research by the BFI, the UK’s leading film body, released yesterday, showed that British films led the UK box office charts and took 32 per cent of the market. The sky's the limit: British films like Skyfall and Warhorse topped the box office in 2012 . Skyfall starring Daniel Craig was the top grossing film last year, taking £102 million in the box office . Cinema admissions increased by almost one million to 172.5million in the year - the second highest in 10 years. As a result of this more than £1billion was brought in at box offices across the year. The top grossing film at the box . office in 2012, taking £102million, was the latest James Bond outing – . Skyfall – which is classed as a joint British and American film. In second place was another . Anglo-American blockbuster, The Dark Knight Rises, the most recent . Batman film, which grossed £56million. Six of the top 20 films were classed . as jointly British, with Ridley Scott’s Prometheus in ninth place and . other UK films The Woman in Black, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and . War Horse making the list. Daniel Radcliffe fronted The Woman in Black . was the top earning UK independent film, making £21million at the box . office. War Horse, directed by Steven Spielberg, was one of the most popular British films of the last year . The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel starring Judi Dench and Bill Nighy was one of six British films to make the top 20 . The BFI said British success had come . through mainstream blockbusters like Skyfall and Prometheus but also . through the independent sector. Of the 32 per cent share of cinema . going for ‘British’ films, the research showed that 22.9 per cent were . backed by US studios and nine per cent were British independent films. The report said even though there were . other huge distractions during the year including the Queen’s Diamond . Jubilee celebrations and the Olympics in London, cinema-going still held . up relatively well. The Woman in Black, starring Daniel Radcliffe, was the biggest earning UK independent film, bringing in £21million . The BFI, who released the figures, . said although the early summer marked an ‘unsurprising downturn’ in . cinema business that some of the weekend box office results during these . periods were among the highest of the year. It pointed out that during the weekend . of ‘Super Saturday’ at the Olympics, where Britain won three track and . field gold medals in one night, it was also the sixth highest weekend of . the year for cinema business with films such as Ted and The Dark Knight . Rises on release. Britain is regarded as the ‘country of . origin’ on a film, or jointly so, if a significant enough part of the . film, such as filmmakers, crew, studios or locations, are from here.","Cinema admissions in Britain increased by almost one million last year .

Grilling: Chairman Lady Margaret Hodge said the evidence given by accountancy bosses was 'shocking' and 'laughable' Britain's biggest accounting firms yesterday said they were ‘proud’ of making billions helping companies avoid UK tax. In ‘shocking’ evidence to MPs, bosses told how they regularly advised wealthy corporate clients to use offshore havens and legal loopholes to minimise UK tax payments. They admitted to having more than 200 offices in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands or Switzerland. One even confessed to selling policies which had a high chance of later being declared unlawful in court. Helping companies avoid tax earned them more than £2billion a year, said the four firms – KPMG, PWC, Ernst & Young and Deloitte. The testimony was condemned as ‘shocking’ and ‘depressing’ by MPs on the public accounts committee. Astonishingly, each of the executives in turn said they were ‘proud’ of their work. Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PWC, said: ‘We are giving the best advice we can to clients on the options which they have. ‘I don’t see anything wrong with that.’ But committee chairman Margaret Hodge said Mr Nicholson’s company’s activity ‘stinks’. She said the taxman had little hope of . competing in a ‘David and Goliath’ battle against the accountancy giants . paid millions to help companies avoid tax. Mr Nicholson yesterday admitted selling policies which had a 75 per cent chance of being later declared unlawful. Mrs Hodge replied: ‘I find that shocking.’ It also emerged that the companies all send senior tax partners to HMRC or the Treasury to help draft new legislation. When they return to their firms, the companies use the new-found knowledge of loopholes to devise new ways for corporations to avoid paying full dues to the taxman. Mrs Hodge said it was ‘depressing’ that such ‘clever’ people had chosen to work ‘in an area which reduces the available resources for us to build schools, hospitals and transport infrastructure’. She told the companies they should be barred from receiving government contracts worth millions if they deliberately advised their wealthy firms and individuals to cut the tax they pay to the Treasury. But the firms were unrepentant. Bill Dodwell, head of tax at Deloitte, said: ‘We help make the tax system work.’ Another boss, Jane McCormick of KPMG, insisted: ‘Our main purpose is to help our clients pay their tax’ – a statement Mrs Hodge described as ‘laughable’. The four heads of tax were grilled for almost three hours in the House of Commons in the midst of huge public controversy over the low tax bills paid by multinationals such as Amazon, Google and Starbucks. Dismissed: Jane McCormick from KPMG said her company's job was to 'help clients pay tax' - a claim Margaret Hodge described as 'laughable' In his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Prime Minister David Cameron said there were ‘some forms of avoidance that have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these raise ethical issues’. He warned he would use Britain’s presidency of the G8 to press for action from the world’s most powerful governments. But the firms denied their practices were ‘aggressive’ and were keen to distinguish between evasion – which is illegal and which they all said they would not engage in – and avoidance, which is taking advantage of incentives within the system.","Bosses told public accounts committee how they advise wealthy clients to use offshore havens and legal loopholes to minimise UK tax payments .

Escalating the years-long war of words over the sovereignty, Mr Timerman said in a curt letter that he was sorry that Mr Hague 'can't meet without the supervision of the colonists from the Malvinas'. He added: 'It's a shame that you reject a bilateral meeting. You need not keep trying to put together meetings during my visit to London. Leave that job to our own efficient embassy.' Representatives of the Falkland Islands government, which Argentina does not recognise as legitimate, had hoped to tell Mr Timerman that Buenos Aires should respect islanders' rights and leave them in peace.

The United Nations regards the dispute over the islands which Argentina knows as the Malvinas as a bilateral issue between Buenos Aires and London, he said. Mr Timerman has now invited Mr Hague . to meet with him in Buenos Aires, where he said 'my fellow foreign . ministers can freely meet with whomever they wish without being . pressured or having their presence conditioned on meetings that they . haven't asked for and don't interest them'. Strong opinion: Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has . been very outspoken about the Falklands and has demanded negotiations . with Britain . Argentine president Cristina .

Earlier this month, she had an advert published in British newspapers claiming that Argentina had been stripped of the islands in 'a blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism'. Prime Minister David Cameron has repeatedly insisted the residents of the Falklands must decide their own future and a referendum on the islands' political status is to be held in March. In a statement released before Mr Timerman turned down the meeting, the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands stressed that their representatives, Dick Sawle and Jan Cheek, would not be 'negotiating any deal'. 'Rather we are anticipating a full and frank exchange of views,' the assembly said. 'Indeed we look forward to giving Mr Timerman some very direct messages on the unacceptability of Argentina's actions against the Falkland Islands in recent years. 'We demand that our rights be respected, and that we be left in peace to choose our own future and to develop our country for our children and generations to come. 'It is only right that he should hear this directly from us, as well as from Mr Hague.' The statement went on to cite Britain's opposition to 'any negotiations over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until the Falkland Islanders so wish'. History: Steel helmets abandoned by Argentine armed forces who surrendered at Goose Green to British Falklands Task Force troops during the Falklands War . 'The Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly believes that the result of the forthcoming referendum will demonstrate definitively that we do not. Should the issue of sovereignty be raised at the meeting, it will not be discussed,' it said. 'Members of the Legislative Assembly made it clear in their letter of 2012 to President Fernandez de Kirchner... that the Falkland Islands Government is willing to meet with the Government of Argentina in order to make our views clear, and to discuss matters of mutual interest including fisheries and communication.'

Impostor: A Facebook picture of the Adelaide teenager shows him wearing a medical uniform including a stethoscope . A teenager who had been audaciously impersonating a doctor at two hospitals in Australia in echoes of the Leonardo Di Caprio movie 'Catch Me If You Can' has been arrested - four months after his ruse began. The 17-year-old was charged yesterday with administering a prescription drug, aggravated assault and identity theft, after he treated a 12-year-old girl for minor injuries after a scooter accident at Edwardstown on Monday. But incredibly, it is believed he had wandering the corridors of the Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia since October, wearing scrubs, a name badge and a stethoscope, and even reading patient notes. And while police and hospital chiefs claimed to have known his identity all along, they said they were unable to arrest him because he had not been caught interacting directly with any patients. There had also been numerous sightings of him on the grounds of Flinders Medical Centre in the city.

The memo noted that he . has 'not to date committed substantive offences, but should he make . physical contact with a patient, posing as a clinician, this would . constitute criminal assault'. The . Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Authority first warned .

Britain to 20 years of lavish aid spending – as figures revealed that . other developed countries are slashing their aid budgets to focus on . helping their own people. Speaking at a United Nations aid . conference in the impoverished West African state of Liberia, the Prime . Minister called on world leaders to back a new target of ending global . poverty by 2030. The goal suggests Mr Cameron’s . controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on . foreign aid will have to be maintained for a generation. Scroll down for video . David Cameron was greeted by schoolchildren as he arrived at Roberts international airport in Monrovia , Liberia on the latest leg of his tour of Africa . The Prime Minister has refused to back down on his commitment to international aid, telling MPs that it forms just as important a part of his foreign policy as the military and security response to terrorism in North Africa. His comments come as figures show that seven out of ten developed countries are slashing their foreign aid budgets to focus on dealing with problems at home. British aid spending will rise in April as the percentage of the country’s income spent on foreign aid rises from 0.56 per cent to hit the 0.7 per cent target for the first time. The Prime Minister tweeted a picture of himself meeting schoolchildren in Liberia yesterday . This translates into an increase in . aid spending from £8.65billion this year to £11.3billion next year – a . rise of more than 30 per cent. But figures released by the UN show that global aid fell by 4.5 per cent in 2011 as austerity hit developed countries. Austria, Belgium, Greece, Japan and . Spain were among 16 of 23 developed countries cutting back. On average, . developed countries now spend only 0.31 per cent of their income on aid – . less than half the British target. The figures, buried in the UN’s . annual report on the current round of Millennium Development Goals, will . pile pressure on Mr Cameron to drop his aid pledge and spend the . £2.65billion on services for people in this country. Tory Cabinet ministers are pressing . the Prime Minister to relax the target to limit the need for cuts to . essential public services such as defence and policing. Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘British . people will simply not understand why we are increasing aid at a time . when other countries are cutting theirs. ‘It is madness for us to be borrowing more money to give away when families at home are struggling. ‘The aid budget should have been . frozen at the level when we came into office instead of pursuing this . arbitrary target. No-one will argue with wanting to end world poverty, . but if the solution was more aid money we would have achieved it years . ago. ‘We should be focusing on opening up . our markets to allow these countries to trade.’ Opening yesterday’s . conference, which he co-chaired, Mr Cameron insisted aid money was . vital. He added: ‘I’m co-chairing the panel . that is going to write the rules for aid and development for the world . for the next 20 years, and I think it’s very important we keep a focus . on eradicating extreme poverty – here in Liberia, one in ten children . don’t make it to the age of five – but I also think it’s important we . look at those things that keep countries poor: conflict, corruption, . lack of justice, lack of the rule of law. ‘Those things matter, as well as aid and money.’ Mr Cameron said he was ‘proud’ that Britain was meeting its aid pledges even if others were not. Outlining the new targets, he said: . ‘There should be a real focus on eradicating extreme poverty – that . should be our rallying cry. We can do it in our generation.’ n MR Cameron will host a top-level . summit at Chequers tomorrow to try to stop Afghanistan falling into the . hands of the Taliban after British troops leave in 2014.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:17 EST, 1 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:12 EST, 1 February 2013 . A man in his 20s was stabbed at court today by a gang of masked youths in a suspected revenge attack. The victim saw the gang jump out of a car as he was leaving Inner London Crown Court and tried to run back inside but got stuck in the revolving door. They knifed him in the stomach in front of security and then fled, while police and the London Ambulance Service treated him on the floor of the security hall. The man is thought to be the friend of a defendant who was in court in connection with a gang attack at a London hospital. A man was stabbed outside Inner London Crown Court today and a gang was seen running from the area . The stabbing may have been a revenge attack after a rival gang member was targeted in a hospital . The gang, who were wearing scarves over their faces, were able to get to him before the metal  detectors and X-rays that everyone entering the court must pass through. The victim is now in hospital with wounds to the stomach or ribs and police are still looking for his attackers, who are thought to be part of a Brixton street gang. A court source said the victim's friend was a defendant and had seemed terrified after his court appearance. The source said: 'He was extremely frightened and wanted to seek refuge in the court. He hung around right up until lunchtime even though his case finished half an hour before. 'He was afraid to go home. I suggest he never goes home because I don't think he will ever be safe with people like that out there.' The source said the stabbed man was with the defendant when the attack happened. 'The victim was leaving court with a group of other men, some of who were defendants. Shock: Police cars gathered outside after the man, thought to be a defendant's friend, was knifed . 'As he went outside, a group of men with scarves covering their faces jumped out a car and ran towards the building. 'The man tried to get back inside but he got caught in the revolving door and that's when they stabbed him. 'I didn't see a knife but I saw one of them doing a stabbing motion, then they ran off. 'He collapsed as he came back into court and I could see they'd got him in the ribs. There was a trail of blood from the door to where he laid on the floor afterwards.' The stabbing may have been a revenge attack after a rival gang member was targeted in a hospital in 2011. Describing the original attack, the source said: 'They were literally going from ward to ward and pulling back curtains looking for somebody. Violence: The youth collapsed just inside the court and was treated there before being taken to hospital . 'The kid they were looking for had already been stabbed in the eye but I guess they hadn't finished him off properly so they broke into the hospital to get him - but when they couldn't find him they stabbed someone else. 'It's crazy. If they can stab someone in a hospital it's not a big deal for them to come to court and stab someone. It's kudos for them if they're not afraid to do that.' Seven men are due to stand trial over the hospital attack later this year for charges of violent disorder, affray and having an offensive weapon. Police are trying to identify the latest attackers from CCTV footage captured of the assault. A witness, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was sitting inside and there were a group of lads at the top of the steps. They weren’t doing anything then all of a sudden four unknown guys rushed in from the car park. 'They came in and one guy got stabbed. They tried to rush through then stabbed him in the chest, like the lower abdomen, and ran out.' Police cars littered the court car park while the man was treated for his injuries. Paramedics tried to stop the bleeding before he was carried out of court on a stretcher and taken to hospital. Marked man: A source said the defendant linked with the victim had seemed scared to leave the court . Another witness said: 'There were about four or five of them and they looked young. They ran up the steps and started shouting. 'They had scarves over their faces. They ran out about 20 seconds later and went onto the street round the side of the court. 'It was only when I went over that I saw the lad on the ground and realised someone had been stabbed.' A spokesman for the Met Police said: 'There has been a stabbing just outside the front entrance of the court. In terms of who this person is and how they relate to any court case we cannot say at this stage. 'They have been taken to hospital but their injuries are not thought to be life threatening.' A spokesman for the ambulance service said: 'We were called at 12.45 to reports of a stabbing at Newington Causeway. 'We send a car, an ambulance crew and a duty officer and the air ambulance medical team in a car. We treated a man in his 20s at the scene who was then taken to hospital.'","He is thought to be the friend of a defendant who was leaving court .

A young person who wants to buy their first home will need to find a deposit of £60,000 by the end of the decade, a shocking report revealed yesterday. The study highlights the nightmare facing a generation of young people who have little or no chance of buying a home unless they are rich, well-paid or have generous parents. In London, the situation will be even more acute with the average deposit set to hit more than £110,000 in 2020. Money: A typical first-time buyer last year put down a deposit of £43,300 on a property which cost £173,200 . This is more money than would have been needed to buy a home in the capital in 1998 - but will soon just cover a small deposit on the same property. The analysis, from the consultancy Oxford Economics, says a typical first-time buyer last year put down a deposit of £43,300 on a property which cost £173,200. But the financial pressure on young people is going to get even worse over the next seven years, according to the report, which looks only at England. By 2020, it says a first-time buyer who puts down a 25 per cent deposit will need £61,300 to buy the average young person’s home which will cost £245,165. Teresa Richardson, assistant director of the National Housing Federation, which commissioned the research, said England is facing ‘a housing crisis of huge proportions.’ She said: ‘A whole generation is at risk of being priced out of home ownership forever. Options: By 2020, the report says a first-time buyer who puts down a 25 per cent deposit will need £61,300 to buy the average young person's home which will cost £245,165 . ‘By 2020, the average deposit required for a first home will be more than £60,000 - and in London it will top £100,000. 'Where are young first-time buyers and hard-working families supposed to find the money for the safe, secure home that so many of us aspire to?' Teresa Richardson, assistant director of the National Housing Federation . ‘Where are young first-time buyers and hard-working families supposed to find the money for the safe, secure home that so many of us aspire to?’ By 2020, it predicts the average salary will be around £30,000, which means the deposit will be the equivalent of two years’ salary before tax, an impossible amount of money to save. At this level, the cost of their first home will be eight times larger than their salary. Two-thirds of first-time buyers only managed to get onto the property ladder due to the ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. The CML said 66 per cent of first-time buyers in recent years have had ‘parental assistance’. Problematic system: The Housing Minister, Mark Prisk, said Britain has a 'dysfunctional' housing market because so many young people cannot fulfil their dream of buying a home . This puts huge pressure on parents, many of whom feel obligated to help out their children to get onto the housing ladder, even if they cannot really afford to help. It comes after the Housing Minister, Mark Prisk, said Britain has a ‘dysfunctional’ housing market because so many young people cannot fulfil their dream of buying a home. Speaking at a CML conference in November, the Tory MP said it ‘cannot be right’ that large numbers of people in their 20s and 30s cannot afford to buy their own home. Mr Prisk, a former chartered surveyor, said the coalition Government has inherited ‘a dysfunctional housing market whether it is freehold or leasehold.’ He said: ‘We see 1.6million young people - people in their 20s and 30s - still living with Mum and Dad because they can’t afford their own place. That cannot be right.’ When saving for a deposit, it is easy to forget that there are a whole range of other fees that you need to think about. Money Advice Service has compiled a list of extra costs to help This Is Money readers, which need to be factored in to your overall buying or moving budget before you take out a mortgage. Fees vary by lender, value of property and mortgage size. Deposit - mortgage providers will need you to save at least 5 per cent of the cost of the home you want to buy. So if you want to buy a home costing £150,000, you’ll need to save £7,500.Mortgage set-up fees - some lenders charge a mortgage booking fee (or equivalent), usually to reserve funds on a fixed or capped rate product. The typical cost is between £99 and £250 and may be refundable if the mortgage application falls through before completion (check this before you pay for it).Mortgage arrangement fee - some mortgage products will incur an upfront fee, which some lenders call an ‘arrangement fee’. This may be in addition to a separate booking fee. It can cost up to £2,000 and is added to your mortgage amount. You will have to pay interest on the amount if you decide to do this.Valuation fee - this is charged by a mortgage lender to value the property you are buying. It costs between £150 and £1,500, depending on value of the property. Some lenders will pay this for you so try and negotiate this into your contract.Mortgage account fee - this is a single fee charged by the lender when you take out your mortgage to cover set up, maintenance and closing down costs of your account. You won't have to pay a separate exit administration fee when you repay your mortgage. It's typically £100 to £300. This is a separate cost from the arrangement fee.Higher lending charge - if you're borrowing most of the value of the property, the lender may charge a fee to take out insurance cover. This protects them in case you can't cover the costs of your repayments and they have to sell your house at a loss. The lender can still chase you for the shortfall.The amount will depend on how much you borrow, and how much you're contributing as a deposit. If you do have to pay one, it’s usually around 1.5 per cent of the amount you’re borrowing. So, for example, on a mortgage of £150,000, this would be £2,250.Searches - you can incur a fee for searches to the local council to check whether there are any planning or local issues that might affect the property’s value. They may also instruct a drains search at the same time. These are usually done by your solicitor. This can cost between £250 to £300.Legal Costs - you will need to pay your solicitor to carry out the legal work. This costs around £500 to £750 plus VAT.Stamp Duty - this is paid on land and property transactions in the UK. This is paid by the buyer and costs between 0 per cent to 7 per cent of the purchase price of the property. (CLICK HERE to use This Is Money's stamp duty calculator)Survey - this is paid by the buyer to a surveyor to check for structural defects on the property.There are three types of survey:Home condition survey – this is the most basic and cheapest survey. It’s best for new-build and conventional homes. Typical cost: £250.Homebuyer’s report – this is a much fuller survey, looking thoroughly inside and outside a property. It also includes a valuation. If you are choosing this option, you should see if you can get the valuation and homebuyer’s report done at the same time to cut costs. Typical cost: £400+Building or structural survey – this is the most comprehensive survey and is done for an older or non-standard property. Costs £600+Registration of title - in Scotland you will need to pay a title registration fee. The cost of this will vary on the value of your property.Moving costs - this cost is paid to the removal firm to move, pack and relocate your possessions. Try the Money Advice Service’s Smart Mover Calculator.Telegraphic transfer fee - paid by the lender to transfer the mortgage money to the seller’s solicitor. Usually between £40-£50.Building insurance fee - some lenders will charge their customers if they choose to take out buildings insurance with a different company. This will cost around £25.

Lucky: This is six-month-old Sam Stevens who was rescued after his buggy was swept into the sea by a freak gust of wind . A baby who was blown into the sea in his buggy is expected to make a full recovery, his father said yesterday. Sam Stevens, aged six months, was in the icy water for ten minutes after a gust of wind caught the buggy. He is thought to have spent several of those minutes face down in the freezing water before a heroic harbour master dived in to save him. George Reeder, 63, managed to turn the floating buggy upright and drag it against the harbour wall. Onlookers then pulled the child to safety before he was taken to hospital. He is said to be making amazing progress despite the length of time he spent in the water. Yesterday the baby’s father spoke of the ‘pure euphoria’ of finding his son had survived – and thanked all involved in the rescue. Martyn Stevens, 35, was at home while his partner Kate Cooper, 34, took their son and dogs for a walk around the nearby marina at Watchet in Somerset. A gust of wind swept the buggy off the sea wall and Sam, strapped in his seat, fell face-down into 12ft of water. Miss Cooper’s screams of ‘My baby! My baby has gone in the water,’ were heard by Mr Reeder. Scroll down for video . Hero: George Reader, the dock master at Watchet Marina in Somerset, dived into freezing cold waters to rescue Sam. Mr Reader is pictured at the harbour . Relieved: Martyn Stevens, 35, the father of baby Sam, stands at the spot where his son was flung into the water.  Tanya Allen, 43, who performed CPR on the baby, is pictured right . He said: ‘When I got there the mum was . screaming and I saw the buggy floating. 'The tide was going out and the . current was strong. It was slowly floating away, being swept out to . sea.’ Dismissing suggestions he had behaved . heroically, Mr  Reeder, who has worked at the marina for 11 years, . added: ‘I didn’t have time to think. I just jumped in. I can’t believe . the baby survived.’ Ten minutes seems an incredibly long time for such a young child to be in the freezing sea and survive. One theory is that an air pocket formed between the water and the back of the floating buggy, allowing Sam to continue to breathe. It is also thought that the bodies of young children are especially efficient at going into shock. A baby’s smaller body slows down the metabolism more quickly than an adult’s and therefore protects the vital organs from being starved of oxygen. In fact, many hospitals deliberately cool new born babies who have been starved of oxygen during birth. One of the young family’s neighbours, . Tanya Allen, 43, then performed CPR on Sam until emergency crews arrived . and an air ambulance flew him to Musgrove Park Hospital, in Taunton. Mr . Stevens recalled the moment on Sunday morning when he was at home and . heard sirens from the marina. He said: ‘I looked up the road to see . what the noise was and saw my friend Ben who looked absolutely . distraught and just shouted at me “It’s your baby, it’s your baby”.’ Mr Stevens ran down to the marina where he saw his son being tended to on the ground. He said: ‘I can’t stress how amazing George was, and Tanya as well.’ Mr Stevens added that Sam had astounded doctors with his recovery and he was expected home in the next few days. ‘All the doctors and nurses said he is doing fantastic,’ he said. ‘They have all been brilliant. ‘I’m feeling overwhelmed. It’s pure euphoria.’ Location: The infant, who was strapped in the buggy, was swept into the water as his mother walked along Watchet Harbour (file picture), Somerset at 8am yesterday .

He has become a household name thanks to his sporting talents and down-to-earth personality. And now, fresh from his boxing ring success, it seems there is no stopping Freddie Flintoff as he unveils a second collection for menswear label Jacamo. The 35-year-old former England cricketer is, unsurprisingly, extremely pleased with how it has turned out - because he wears every single item himself. 'While my stuff isn't depicting high fashion, it's the sort of stuff I'd wear. I wear things that I feel comfortable in . to be honest, I don't follow what's in fashion or the latest . trends I just like to go out feeling comfortable and my line reflects this,' he told MailOnline. Career change: Freddie Flintoff has left his cricket bat behind and tried his hand at clothes designing, here he presents his second collection for Jacamo . The 6ft 4in former Lancashire player embodies the Manchester-based brand's ethos, which aims to cater to men of all shapes and sizes and is well known for its Simply Be and High & Mighty plus-size brands. When the label announced their collaboration with Freddie, Alan White, chief executive of N Brown, said: 'With his broad athletic build, [Freddie] will no doubt provide a strong point of identity for our customer base.' High and mighty: The range of casual clothes and suits has been designed for men of all shapes and sizes and with his tall stature, Freddie is the perfection depiction of that . Freddie is the perfect advocate for the brand and each item of the Flintoff by Jacamo spring/summer range is available in medium to 5XL and in a range of lengths to suit men of varying sizes. Looking casual and cool, the burly blond tried his dab hand at modelling his latest offering in an East London studio shoot. Speaking about the photographs, he said: 'It's weird looking at yourself. I don't think I will ever become a model. I once did a catwalk for a charity fashion show, it wasn't fun. 'Walking down there and back, I know it sounds so . easy but I've never been so self conscious in my life. 'I didn't particularly get good feedback.' Comfortable: Freddie says he doesn't follow high fashion but has designed a line that is stylish yet mainly focuses on comfort . So while he won't be following in fellow athlete David Beckham's modelling footsteps anytime soon, he does admire the footballer's style. 'I am happy how I am and there is no one I want to look like but Beckham dresses well, he really is quite sharp.' He also rates his League of Their Own co-star Jamie Redknapp's suited and booted fashion choices. 'Out of the League of Their Own boys, I've got to say Jamie is the best . dressed or he would be gutted, he loves his clothes. Model behaviour: Freddie looked like a professional modelling his clothes in an East London studio but says he would never consider a career in it . 'I think Jack Whitehall has got the student look down to a T, he looks like . he needs a good wash. 'Having said that, I saw him on the TV the other . night at an awards show and I have never seen him so smart, he combed . his hair and everything. 'As for James Corden, he tries his best on the show and he likes his cardigans and ties but Jamie leads the way.' The day job: Freddie and his co-stars are currently filming more League of Their Own and he rates Jamie Redknapp's style . Following his professional boxing debut in November where he beat American Richard Dawson, Freddie is taking some time out and has moved back up north with his family. 'I am currently taking stock after my boxing. We have moved back up north and are getting the kids settled into school, which I am really enjoying.' The new Spring/Summer Flintoff by Jacamo collection will be available online at Jacamo.co.uk from the 26th February and the current collection is available to view today.","Former cricketer has unveiled second collection for Jacamo .

"By . Peter Lloyd . PUBLISHED: . 09:31 EST, 31 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:02 EST, 31 January 2013 . Amanda Wheeler - a 31 year-old from Cheltenham was found guilty of sexually assaulting several young boys . Yesterday, MailOnline reported on the case of Amanda Wheeler - a 31 year-old from Cheltenham who was found guilty of sexually assaulting several young boys. The mother-of-three got drunk at a party before kissing and groping a 12-year-old on a bench in November 2011. She then performed a lap-dance and straddled a group of male children, before biting a 13-year-old boy on his neck and coercing him to perform a sex act on her. She denied the charges, but was found guilty during a recent trial and faced several years in prison. However, in the latest blow for British justice and men’s rights, she walked free from Birmingham Crown Court with only a suspended prison term and a smirk on her face. Why? Surely it can’t be...Because she’s a woman. Addressing the court during sentencing, Judge Patrick Thomas QC incredulously stated that: ‘Although these were paedophile acts...it was a one-off...they were [also] acts of drunkenness, selfishness and childishness’. He then claimed that sending her to jail would be wrong because her victims have ‘largely recovered’ from their traumatic experiences...as if that makes a difference. Shockingly, this is nothing new. In December last year, Lucie Slater - a 21 year-old woman and former X Factor contestant - glassed her defenceless boyfriend in the face over a Facebook post, but still enjoyed Christmas in the comfort of her own home. Two months previously, Claire Roundhill from Yorkshire was spared jail after getting pregnant by sexually assaulting a 15 year-old boy. Following the ruling, the victim’s father said: ‘If it had been the other way around and this was a man having sex with a 15-year-old girl, he would have been locked up, without a shadow of a doubt. But, because she is a woman, she has walked free.’ Yet, ironically, a man like Scot Young - who’s embroiled in a bitter divorce row with his wife - can be jailed for six months over a private matrimonial matter. It’s a complete joke...without being remotely funny. Sadly, the issue is endemic. Recent national statistics prove that 58 per cent of male offenders who entered a guilty plea were given a custodial sentence - compared with just 34 per cent of UK women. Out of the thirteen women’s prisons in Great Britain, two are private - and the rest benefit from an additional set of ‘gender specific standards’, which men’s don’t. And, in 2010, judges were formally advised to go softer on female criminals, thanks to the (ironically titled) Equal Treatment Bench Book - published by the Judicial Studies Board. Where is the equality in that? Not only does this offend, but it devalues the concept of justice - something which should run through the core of society evenly, like letters in a stick of rock. Recent national statistics prove that 58 per cent of male offenders who entered a guilty plea were given a custodial sentence - compared with just 34 per cent of UK women . Instead, our legal system is being manipulated by the outdated notion of chivalry - something which has no place in modern society, let alone a court of law. And I urge all men, including our dusty, out-of-touch judges, to reject it. Why? Because it’s the foundation of male gender bias. It teaches us to pick up the bill as well as the blame.  Worryingly, it teaches women to expect us to. Yes, I understand it stems from a good place - from wanting to protect a woman from the harshness of the world, but sometimes women are the harshness of the world. This is the inconvenient truth. Sadly, our legal system - which mostly consists of men - would rather be crippled by the romantic view of women than do what’s right for everyone. It might go against our protective instinct, but anything else is political correctness gone mad - and unchallenged. Yet, although it’s men who are allowing women to escape justice, what I find most sinister about these cases - and Wheeler’s in particular - is that there’s no outrage from any of our country’s high-profile, self-confessed feminists. Why haven’t Suzanne Moore or Julie Burchill expressed any outrage? Why is Caitlin Moran - a Twitter bigmouth - silent? Here we have a convicted child sex offender escaping jail, yet not one public feminist figure has spoken out. Not one. Sadly, our legal system - which mostly . consists of men - would rather be crippled by the romantic view of women . than do what’s right for everyone. It might go against our protective . instinct, but anything else is political correctness gone mad - and . unchallenged . Answers on a postcard, please. Fortunately, others with more balanced views have voiced criticism. Egalitarian Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell told Mail Online: ‘If this had been a 31 year-old man with young boys the sentence would have been much tougher. It seems a case of double standards. Child sex abuse, regardless of whether it is perpetrated by men or women, is wrong and should be properly punished.’ Erin Pizzey - who opened the world’s first domestic violence shelter for women in 1971, before exposing feminism’s scope for hypocrisy in her work as a men’s rights activist - agreed. ‘Normal people - drunk or not - do not under any circumstances molest young children,’ she told MailOnline. ‘The fact that this woman insisted on pleading “not guilty” shows she has no remorse. In my opinion, jail was the only option. I cant help feeling that - had she been a man - she would have been incarcerated.’ And they’re right. Feminism (like the law) needs to be even-handed if it is to be credible. It must rage against women’s unfair advantages as well as their disadvantages - both socially and legally. Otherwise, the message they send out is this: treat women equally to men, except when they’re treated better. Anyone who disagrees is not only abusing the system - but our country’s young boys, too.","Judge stated Amanda Wheeler could walk free, saying 'although these were paedophile acts...it was a one-off..

A Bahraini princess who works as a police officer is on trial for torturing two doctors while they were in detention, prosecutors said today. Shaikha Noora Bint Ebrahim Al Khalifa allegedly carried out the abuse during political unrest in the Gulf Arab . kingdom in 2011. A senior official at Bahrain's Public Prosecutor's office said the royal is also facing a separate trial for physically assaulting Aayat Al Qormozi, a young female opposition activist. Facing trial: Bahraini princess Shaikha Noora Bint Ebrahim Al Khalifa is accused of carrying out torture while she worked as a police officer . It allegedly happened while Al Qormozi was in detention during the same period, Nawaf Hamza, head of the Public Prosecution's Special Investigation Unit, said. 'The charge is that she used torture, force and threats against the victims Zahra Al Sammak and Kholoud Al Durazi to make them confess to a crime,' Hamza, referring to the two doctors, said by telephone. According to Al Sammak's lawyer, the alleged torture took place in March and April 2011, a period when the kingdom was convulsed by unrest following the start in February of demonstrations led by Shiites demanding democratic change in the country. A request has been made for comment from Shaikha Noora on the charges against her to her lawyer, Fareed Gazi. He responded later saying he had spoken to her but that she did not wish to comment. 'Of course, she denies all the charges against her,' Gazi said, referring to the allegations at issue in both of the trials. An independent commission said 35 people died during the unrest and two months of martial law that followed, but the opposition puts that number at more than 80. The government rejects the figures and has accused opposition groups of being linked to Iran. There was major civil unrest in early 2011 when the princess was accused of administering torture. Here tear gas is fired on anti-government protesters in Manama, Bahrain . A Bahraini anti-government demonstrator lies injured on a stretcher as Bahraini anti-government demonstrators take him to hospital in Manama, Bahrain, during protests in February 2011 . Shaikha Noora is about 29 years old, . according to media reports, and is one of many members of the family who . hold jobs in the public sector. At the time of the protests that shook . Bahrain in 2011, she worked in the police drugs control unit, but has . since moved to another department, according to Gazi. Bahrain's Information Minister, Samira Rajab, confirmed Shaikha Noura was on trial in both cases. 'There was an investigation and her case was then referred to the court,' she said. Rajab . said Shaikha Noora's trial was part of the Bahraini government's . accountability drive following the publication of the so-called . 'Bassiouni' report last year. Protesters clash with police following a mourning march for a citizen journalist killed in Salmabad village, south of Manama, Bahrain . Widespread and excessive force, including confessions under torture, was detailed in a commission led by Cherif Bassiouni, a respected United Nations human rights lawyer, which published its findings and recommended measures to stop them. The Bahrain government says it has taken steps to address the brutality of security forces by dismissing those responsible and introducing cameras at police stations to monitor abuses. Bahrain drew fierce criticism from abroad for arrests of doctors and nurses during and after the uprising. Since March 2011, at least 60 health professionals have been tried and sentenced to jail terms of up to 15 years on charges including attempting to bring down the government, according rights group Physicians for Human Rights. Most appealed and the majority had their sentences reduced or quashed, including Al Sammak, one of the doctors Shaikha Noora is alleged to have tortured. An anesthetist, Al Sammak was initially sentenced by a military court to five years in jail but was later acquitted by a civil court, according to her lawyers. Al Durazi was detained for allegedly providing false news about people injured in the unrest and inciting hatred of the government. In the second case against Shaikha Noora, activist and poet Aayat Al Qormozi, born in 1991, says the princess applied electric shocks to her face, spat in her mouth and beat her while she was in detention, Al Qormozi's lawyer Reem Khalaf said. However, the charge against Shaikha Noora in this case makes no reference to torture. Al Qormozi was jailed for a year in 2011 for insulting the king, taking part in illegal gatherings and inciting hatred against the government, Khalaf said. She was freed after serving only several months, Khalaf said, adding she did not know the reasons for her early release. Her case was later dismissed by the public prosecutor, again for reasons she did not know, Khalaf said. Khalaf added that the trial of Shaikha Noora on the charges relating to Al Qormozi had been running since June 2012. The next hearing would be on February 7, she said. In the case concerning the two doctors, Shaikha Noora's lawyer said the princess's trial had started in October 2012 and that the next hearing was set for February 3. The opposition wants a constitutional monarchy and a more equitable political system that would allow them to have greater representation, ending decades-old discrimination against them in jobs including the army and security forces. The government denies discriminating against the Shiite population.","Noora Bint Ebrahim Al Khalifa allegedly carried out the abuse in 2011 .

What should have been a colourful debate on This Morning turned nasty today when the sex therapist invited onto the show unleashed a personal attack on the show's resident agony aunt. Louise van der Velde, who recently spoke out to slam marriage as 'for mugs' appeared on the breakfast show to defend her claims that marriage is an outdated concept - and that couples would be much happier if they were allowed to seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere. But when the This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson replied that she believed unless both couples agreed on an open marriage they should remain faithful, Louise van der Velde turned on her, calling her 'out of touch' and an 'old battleaxe'. Head to head: Louise van der Velde takes on Denise Robertson over the matter of adultery within marriage - and ends up calling her an 'out of touch battleaxe' Denise, who is a formidable woman at the best of times, looked reasonably shocked by the outburst - but Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were horrified. 'No one insults our Denise,' said Phillip, as Holly turned away from Louise, saying that actually Denise gave excellent advice. The insult came about after Louise had spoken out to defend her choice to have four lovers. But as a single woman, Phillip argued Louise was welcome to have as many lovers as she liked. Denise agreed, saying, 'If a single person wants to have sex with74 people in a week, it's none of my business. 'If a married couple agree they both want to have sex elsewhere, it's none of my business. But when one person in a marriage wants to sleep with someone else but the other doesn't, it can cause great pain. Open: Louise, who has four lovers, extolls the virtues of an open marriage, saying men and women should be able to seek sex elsewhere . Outburst: Denise looked shocked when Louise unleashed a torrent of abuse . 'I know from the letters I receive the agony that it causes when one member of a couple is unfaithful,' Denise went on. But Louise took umbrage at her words - and let her know in no uncertain terms. 'You are a battleaxe,' she told a stunned Denise. 'You need to get with the modern times. You're an ""agony"" aunt. You deal with agony. 'Things have changed. Having an open marriage doesn't have to be agony.' Louise went on to say she believes there is too much pressure on people to get married - meaning too many of use end up trapped in unhappy unions - something she has referred to as the 'prison' of marriage. 'If you find the right partner from the off, you won't have that problem,' she says, adding that seeking a lover elsewhere can be the perfect antidote to an unhappy marriage. 'What's wrong with that?' she asks. 'Make yourself feel great. It can help people to lift their vibrations.' But, argues Denise, doesn't that mean you are simply trapped in a prison of a marriage, but you have the added pain of not knowing where your partner is, or with whom? Trouncing: Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were shocked by Louise's personal attack on Denise, and took great pleasure in reading out the poll results that proved the viewers sided with their agony aunt . 'If your marriage is a prison, you should get out,' says Denise. 'I'm all in favour of getting a divorce and having a new beginning, if that's the right thing to do. 'No one should be trapped in a marriage they consider to be a prison.' At the end of the debate, with Phillip and Holly shell-shocked and Denise storing up some choice words she later said she could easily have unleashed on Louise, the presenters turned to the viewers poll to see whether they agreed with Louise and her take on marriage, or with Denise. Unsurprisingly, 93 per cent of the viewers sided with Denise, while just seven per cent were on Louise's side. Phillip and Holly took great pleasure in highlighting the disparity, telling Louise they believed it was the most convincing defeat in the history of the show. As Phillip said, nobody messes with our Denise. After the show, Louise said: 'My argument on the show, and which I make in my book, is that people have to find the relationship model which works for them. 'If you still believe a relationship model which is 300 years old is still relevant today then perhaps you are a battleaxe. 'I don't regret what I said to Denise. Her model is outdated and I don't think she lives in the real world. 'She needs to see how many affairs are going on out there. She is out of touch. She is very stuck in her beliefs about the traditional relationship model and won't accept any new ideas.' VIDEO  Louise van der Velde calls Denise Robertson an old battleaxe on This Morning .

A betting shop sign that killed a pedestrian when it ripped off in high winds may have been weakened after maintenance carried out before Christmas, it was claimed today. The sign on the William Hill betting shop crashed down on top of the passerby in Camden Road, north London, just before 5pm last night splitting his head open.

Flowers were today left at the scene of the tragic accident as it emerged maintenance work may have taken place on the building before Christmas . Friends at the scene in Camden left an emotional tribute to the victim, named on a written tribute as 'Jacko'. The group of three women and a man left a card and flowers in front of the Camden William Hill store this afternoon about 2.30pm . Visibly distraught, the group also left a New Zealand flag as a tribute to their friend, who suffered a cardiac arrest and died shortly after being rushed to hospital. The moving written tribute, left amongst other bouquets of flowers at the scene, said: 'This is not how it was supposed to go. We had so many good plans and so many good memories. I promise never to forget you.' Today pensioner Dave Preston who . lives above the betting shop claimed the fascia board could have been weakened by pigeon spikes put up there. The 68-year-old, who has lived above the shop for 45 years, said: 'I was in the kitchen and I heard what sounded like an . explosion, I didn't know what to think, I thought it could have been . the gas. Police have cordoned off the scene and are currently carrying out an investigation .

'I just felt sorry for his parents or . girlfriend or maybe wife I don't know. It is just tragic to think about, . such a young life.' Other witnesses have also spoken of the tragic scene. Ken Osbourne, 28, who works in Woody . Grill next to the betting shop said: 'I saw the guy lying down in the road, covered in blood. 'The main impact was clearly on his head. the blood was mainly around his head. I saw them trying to resuscitate him in the back of the ambulance.' Shopkeeper Fazle Elahi, who works . opposite the scene and was on the scene to witness the aftermath, told . the Camden New Journal: 'The ambulance came really quickly. It looked . like the William . Hill sign had hit him. A woman at the scene was crying. He wasn't . moving.' Cordoned off: Police are now carrying out a detailed forensic examination of the scene in Camden Road, north London, for clues about what caused the fatal incident . Distraught: Flowers have been laid at the scene where the young man was killed by a falling shop hoarding in Camden Road .

Tragic: The young victim was walking past this William Hill bookmakers, pictured with its hoarding in place, in Camden Road, north London . She added: 'I just want to go home and . cry. I don't know how that can happen. The sign is huge. Everyone said . he was just walking past the shop. 'I cross that way five times a day. That could have been me.' A nearby worker added: 'It was the . centre of Camden during the rush hour. It's a horrible day, raining and . windy. It looks like the entire front facade of William Hill was blown . off and hit the man.' Pictures of the scene show the twisted large blue frontage of the shop stretching across the pavement. A London Ambulance Service . spokeswoman said: 'An ambulance crew who were close to the incident were . on the scene very quickly with another medic in responder car. 'Extensive . efforts were made to resuscitate him both at the scene and on way to . hospital. He was taken to University College Hospital as a priority on . blue lights.' A Met . Police spokesman said: 'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended . and the man, believed aged in his 20s, has been taken to a central .

A police officer has been arrested on suspicion of leaking information to the media during the 'Plebgate' affair which forced the Government's chief whip Andrew Mitchell to resign. The Metropolitan Police said the 46-year-old PC, from the Diplomatic Protection Group unit which guards Downing Street, was arrested at his workplace in central London today on suspicion of misconduct in a public office. A statement said he was not one of the officers present during the incident when Andrew Mitchell rowed with officers who would not open the gates of Downing Street to let him ride out on his bicycle. Investigation: Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, right, ordered an investigation into the 'Plebgate' affair that forced former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, left, to resign . But the officer is suspected of disclosing information to the media without authorisation. He was taken to a London police station where he remains in custody. Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe had promised that charges would be brought in the case by the end of January. He said he hoped to hand a file to prosecutors in a matter of weeks. Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell was forced to quit his Cabinet post amid a storm of protest - fuelled by the Police Federation - over claims he called officers 'plebs' during an altercation in Downing Street. But new evidence has since emerged raising question marks over what happened and the Federation launched an internal review. Investigators have taken statements from all 800 officers in the Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) as part of the inquiry. Fresh evidence, including this CCTV evidence, has emerged since the row which has raised questions about what really happened . A 52-year-old PC, also in the Diplomatic Protection Group, and a 23-year-old man are currently on bail after being arrested as part of the investigation, codenamed Operation Alice. Police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), who continue to supervise the investigation, has been informed. In a statement issued this afternoon the force said: 'We continue to work closely with the Crown Prosecution Service but because of on-going developments no formal submission of an interim report has been made to them at this stage. 'The allegations in relation to this matter are extremely serious and it is therefore vital that a thorough and proportionate investigation is carried out. 'The investigation continues to be progressed with urgency, determination and an open mind.' Separate to today's arrest and the other two previous arrests, four police constables in the Diplomatic Protection Group have been issued with Regulation 15 notices. These were issued in late December and early January. Three have been placed on restricted duty. A Regulation 15 is a notice served on an officer when there is an allegation made that their conduct may have breached the standards of professional behaviour and that there will be an investigation into the circumstances. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","The 46-year-old PC, from the Diplomatic Protection Group unit, was arrested this morning at his workplace in central London .

Nine new enormous bronze bells have arrived at the Paris cathedral to replace the old ones that had been discordant for decades, and to help the landmark rediscover its historical harmony. The bells, named after saints, and prominent Catholic figures, will be on display at Notre Dame from Saturday until February 25 when they will be hoisted to its iconic twin towers. New arrival: Nine new enormous bronze bells arrived at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris as part of celebrations to mark 850 years since it was built . Spectacle: Visitors gather around the new bells in front of the landmark in Paris . The new bells are scheduled to ring for the first time March 23, in time for Palm Sunday and Easter week. The diocese decided to have new ones cast . as part of celebrations marking 850 years since the beginning of the . cathedral's construction in 1163. It took nearly 90 years to build. Although the sound of Notre Dame will no . longer be that of the medieval bells fictionally operated by French . author Victor Hugo's hunch-backed bell-ringer, Quasimodo, it will be a . great improvement. The old bells, which dated from different . periods throughout Notre Dame's history, were out of tune with each . other and with Emmanuel, which has hung in the cathedral since the 17th . century, according to cathedral officials. The bells! The bells! A truck loaded with Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral new bells crosses the Place de l'Etoile in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . Journey: Eight of the nine new bells were cast in a foundry in the Normandy town of Villedieu-les-Poeles before they were sent on a convoy of trucks to Paris . A new bell known as Gabriel bound for the Notre Dame cathedral is transported on a truck past Concorde Square in Paris . Eight . of the nine new bells were cast in a foundry in the Normandy town of . Villedieu-les-Poeles. The ninth - a ‘bourdon,’ or Great Bell, named . Marie - was cast in the Netherlands and then sent to Normandy to join . the others. The president . of the foundry rang the bells, to the cheers of onlookers, before the . nine new bells were sent on a convoy of trucks Thursday from . Villedieu-les-Poeles to Paris. They . are joining the cathedral's oldest surviving bell, a Great Bell named . Emmanuel, to restore the ten-bell harmony originally conceived for Notre . Dame's bell towers. A truck loaded with the new bells crosses the Place de l'Etoile in front of the Arc de Triomphe . Ding dong!: Among nine new bells, the biggest one, 'Marie' was made in the Dutch Royal Eijbouts foundry in Asten, weigh 6 tons and plays a G sharp note . Quite the attraction: People pose and take pictures as a bell arrives at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris . The arrival of the bells ‘is historic . precisely because since the 18th century, we haven't experienced such an . event,’ said the cathedral's rector, Patrick Jacquin. ‘During the French Revolution, they (the . bells) were all brought down and broken except the great bell, . Emmanuel, which is here and four other bells that were recast in the . middle of the nineteenth century.... This will complete in a definitive . manner the entire set of 10 bells as conceived ... in the Middle Ages.’ The €2 million (£1.7 million) bell-casting project was funded via donations, cathedral officials say. ‘Historically the idea of this project was to recreate the old bells of Notre Dame in terms of power, in terms of tune, which means that there will be again 10 bells ringing into the cathedral as it used to be in the Middle Ages and up until the French Revolution,’ said Paul Bergamo, president of the Cornille-Havard Foundry in Villedieu-les-Poeles. Taking in the sights: The bells pass by some of the major landmarks of the French capital, including the Eiffel Tower . A bell on its way to Notre Dame Cathedral crosses the Pont d'Arcole in front of city hall . One of the new bells was named Jean-Marie, after Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, a Jewish-born convert to Catholicism whose mother was killed at the Auschwitz death camp and who later worked to reconcile Catholics and Jews. Lustiger was archbishop of Paris from 1981 to 2005; Jean-Marie was the name he adopted when he converted to Catholicism. ‘This is a wonderful return to history and at the same time an extraordinary leap forward because it means that with these bells we are going to endure for the centuries to come,’ said the rector.","The old bells - there since 17th century - had been discordant for decades .

Katie Couric had to rebuff the unwanted sexual advances from the much-older, and eight-times married, talk show legend Larry King following a horrible date, she revealed last night. The two went for dinner at an Italian restaurant in Washington, D.C. about 25 years ago and afterwards King drove them back to his apartment where he tried to put the moves on her, she said during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! 'So we sat there and what can I say, he lunged,' Couric said, as Kimmel cracked up and interjected, 'Incredible.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No chemistry: King and Couric, seen here together in 2011, went on a date about 25 years ago where King tried to put the moves on the up-and-coming journalist . Couric, now 56, said their one and only date took place when she was about 30-years-old and during a time when she decided to be more adventurous in her love life. 'I was going through this period of my life that I was going, ""I'm going to go out with anyone who asks me because you learn something every time.' "" After King, who has famously been married eight times, met her at a restaurant and later called her to ask her out. 'And I thought well that would be really interesting,' she said of her reason for saying yes. She said King, now 79-years-old, came to her apartment to pick her up driving a Lincoln Town Car and then they went to dinner. 'They put us right next to each other like they do with all the men and their 'nieces.' 'He had ordered the veal poached in chicken stock because he had just had quadruple bypass, which was hot,' Couric joked. Back in the day: These pictures of Couric and King are from 1991, around the time they went out on a terrible date together to an Italian restaurant in Washington, D.C. The rest of the meal went 'nice enough' Couric said, but she was soon thrown for a shock when she realized he wasn't taking her back to her apartment. 'I go, 'Larry, where are we going' and he goes, 'My place.'' 'I was like, 'Oh mother of God.' I was like 'Dear, Cosmo what do i do?' I was only 30, I could not figure out how to extricate myself from it.' Behind the wheel: Couric imitates King driving his Lincoln Town Car back to his apartment . Shock: Couric has a terrified look as she tells the audience how she felt when she realized she was going back to King's bachelor pad . 'So we go to his apartment in Roslyn [Virginia] and we walk in and its covered in proclamations for  'Larry King Day' and keys to every city in the country. That was sexy!' Soon after they got there, King made his advance towards her, which she quickly rebuffed, she said. Fun night: Couric smiles widely after having a not-terrible dinner with friends on Thursday evening . Better times: Couric doesn't seem to be under the duress she felt while riding in King's Lincoln back to his Virginia home . 'I started laughing a little because the whole situation was like out of a bad Lifetime movie. 'So I said 'Larry, you're such an interesting, nice man but I would like to meet someone a little closer to my age.' 'He said, 'That's okay cause when I like, I really like.'' All smiles now: King and Couric have remained friends despite their awkward date together 25 years ago . King, who has been married to Shawn Southwick since 1997, has a totally different recollection of getting shot down. 'We went out to dinner, a nice Italian restaurant, we drove home, thought we were kind of romantic, we get to her door, in the apartment house and she said, 'Oh, i have a roommate,'' he said in 2009. 'Then I kissed her goodnight and that was that. And we became friends ever since,' he said. Current love: King has been married to Shawn Southwick since 1997. They filed divorce papers in 2010 but both later withdrew them. It his eighth marriage, and longest lasting one . Couric also revealed last night how Michael Jackson once bizarrely asked her on a date after he rejected her request for an interview. 'Can you imagine going home to my daughters who were then about 8 and 4, saying, ‘Honey, Girls. I’m going out on a date with Michael Jackson,' she said. 'I just thought it would be too weird. The tabloids would go crazy and I didn't need that.'","Awkward date occurred about 25 years ago .

Guilty: Shahin Hashemi-Haeri has been given a curfew after admitting a foul-mouthed and racist attack on bouncers at an exclusive Mayfair club . A property manager has been given an all night curfew and told to wear an electronic tag after a drunken row with door staff at an exclusive Mayfair club during which he kicked a bouncer, smashed windows and racially abused staff. Doormen asked Shahin Hashemi-Haeri, 45, to leave the Home House club in Portman Square at around 2am in October last year for being too drunk, a court heard today. But he refused to leave the £1,840-a-year members' club, which has been visited by celebrities including Cheryl Cole, Noel Gallagher and Myleene Klass, shouting 'I'm not leaving you black motherf*****'. After being escorted out, prosecutor Darren Watts told Westminister magistrates court that Hashemi-Haeri, the director of a property management company, later returned and started kicking at the doors. 'He then kicked at the window on the left of the door and continued doing so until it smashed,' Mr Watts said. 'He did the same to the window on the right of the door. 'When the complainant opened the door he saw the defendant walking away. 'When he asked him why he broke the glass he replied ""I don't give a f***"". 'The defendant then kicked him in the shin, causing pain and discomfort. 'The complainant then restrained the . defendant, fearing he would be assaulted again, and the defendant . shouted, ""get off me you black motherf***er"".' The Home House club, which stretches over three Georgian town houses, is in one of London's most expensive postcodes W1. A description on the venue's website claims it is 'London's most exclusive private members’ club'. It also says: 'For members, the best bit is probably that there are no stuffy rules - in fact there really aren't any rules at all. Well, just one: ""Nudity is discouraged"". Naughtiness, on the other hand, is de rigueur.' Members' only: The Home House club in Mayfair describes itself as 'London's most exclusive private members' club' Hashemi-Haeri, who had been a member of the club for nine years, pleaded guilty to criminal damage, common assault and two charges of racial harassment. His lawyer described him as 'a professional man who pays his way in society'. District Judge Michael Fanning spared him a jail sentence because he believed he is 'unlikely to repeat the offences'. But he imposed a six-month curfew meaning Hashemi-Haeri, of Surrey Quays, south London, must stay indoors between 8pm to 7am for the next six months. He will also have to wear an electronic tag to ensure he doesn't violate the punishment. 'I really do find the racially aggravating element in this case deeply unpleasant and deeply offensive' said the District Judge. 'This sort of thing cannot go on. Modern Britain is supposed to be a diverse country, welcoming everyone regardless of their colour, creed or race, and that's why cases of this kind must be marked by the courts. 'To mark the court's displeasure, and society's displeasure, the least sentence I can provide is a community order.'","Shahin Hashemi-Haeri, 45, lashed out after being asked to leave Home House in Portman Square for being too drunk .

Drink driver: William Haswell, 19, caused a four-hour blackout after crashing his father's car into an electricity pole while almost three times over the limit . A drunk teenager caused a four-hour blackout to dozens of homes after crashing his dad's Jaguar into an electricity pole while travelling for a McDonald's breakfast. William Haswell was almost three times over the limit when he took the £11,000 car to a McDonald's drive-thru. But as the 19-year-old travelled to the fast food outlet he lost control of the car. It spun around and smashed into an electricity pole just yards from his home in Boldon Colliery, South Tyneside. The damage to the pole resulted in 39 homes in the area losing power for four hours between 6.45am and 10.45am on November 10 last year. Haswell was arrested at the scene after a breath test showed he had 98mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35mg per 100ml of breath. The teenager pleaded guilty to taking a vehicle without consent and causing an accident, drink driving and driving without insurance, when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday. Paul Anderson, prosecuting, said: 'The car belongs to his father who works in Spain for the majority of the year and he left the defendant strict instructions not to use it. 'At 6.40am on the day in question the police received a report of an accident on Hedworth Lane. 'The defendant had lost control of the car which had spun out of control and hit an electricity pole, causing the lines to come down.' When police got to the crash, Haswell told them it was his fault and that he had been on his way to McDonald's for some breakfast. In his police interview he said he saw some flashing lights behind him, panicked, and put the brakes on. Crash: As the 19-year-old travelled to the fast food outlet he lost control of the car. It spun around and smashed into an electricity pole. This is a file picture . Mr Anderson added: 'He said he had been in Newcastle drinking until 3am and had been home for a couple of hours before getting in the car. 'There was loss of power to 39 homes for four hours and it cost an estimated £1,500 to repair the damage.' The court heard the car cost £11,000 and was not written off. Laura Johnson, defending, said: 'This was a very costly McDonald's breakfast and one, I can only assume, he didn't get to eat. 'He made a stupid decision to drive his father's car after only a couple of hours of sleep following a night out. He is deeply ashamed of himself and embarrassed.' Magistrates gave Haswell a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaidwork and banned him from driving for two years. He was also ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge.","William Haswell was almost three times over the limit .

A Family Services employee has been fired after a seven-year-old boy was beaten to death two days after the department received a call that the boy was being abused - but failed to act on it. Roderick 'RJ' Arrington died on November 30 after he was allegedly brutally beaten by his stepfather, Markiece Palmer, 34, and mother, Dina Palmer, 27, at their home in Las Vegas. Two days earlier, the couple had allegedly beaten the boy for lying about reading a bible verse and for failing to finish his homework, and staff at his school noticed he was unable to sit properly. Loss: Roderick 'RJ' Arrington, 7, was beaten to death by his stepfather and mother in November . He told staff at Roundy Elementary he had been 'spanked' by his parents the night before; police said he was beaten with a paddle and whipped with a belt. School officials followed protocol and immediately called the Family Services hotline to report the apparent abuse, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. But when no one from the department arrived at the school, RJ went home, where he was whipped and beaten by his parents. They called 911 and he died the following day. The arrest report noted 'open abrasions on [Arrington's] buttocks, severe bruising to his thighs, marks and bruises on his back and shoulders and evidence of previous beatings'. He also suffered brain swelling, the report noted. Arrests: Markiece Palmer, 34, and Dina Palmer, 27, allegedly beat the boy for failing to read a bible verse . A police report said RJ suffered massive . brain swelling and bruising over much of his body, including arms, . abdomen, back, legs, thighs and buttocks, where he had open wounds. The couple have been charged with murder and two counts of child abuse. Investigators said Dina Palmer 'stood by and let her husband' shake and beat her son to death. The Clark County Department of Family Services has now released a statement saying some of its staff failed to follow policies before the youngster's death. Investigators determined after RJ's death that the school district officials fulfilled their legal requirements by calling the hotline. Beaten: RJ's teacher's noticed he was not able to sit down at school and he told them he had been spanked, but when school officials called the Family Services hotline, they did not send any help for the boy . In danger: The young boy had only lived with his mother and stepfather for three months . Police also found that Family Services had . not committed a crime, but had issues with 'their reporting . protocols' and would be handled internally and criminal charges are unlikely. The Family Services Department spokesperson said they could not name the fired employee or why exactly they were let go as it was a confidential matter. A special Child Death Review Team will now meet so that all parties, including police, Family Services state partners and the school district, can learn from the case. RJ, who was remembered by his family as a talented singer and performer, lived with his father and grandmother in Illinois until three months before his death. Locked up: His mother and stepfather are now in jail awaiting a preliminary hearing on March 1 . RJ's paternal grandfather, George Roach, told the Review-Journal that the fact that someone had been fired did not bring him any comfort - and he wants county employees to face criminal charges. 'That is what the agency is for, to protect our kids,' he said. 'When a kid says, ""I'm being abused,"" something has to be done immediately.' 'Somebody is liable for this child being dead. It could have been prevented... The child was crying for help.'

David Cameron, who is on a visit to Liberia, has been warned by the UK Statistics Authority he must understand the difference between debt and the deficit . David Cameron was today accused told off by the official statistics watchdog for claiming the government had cut the nation’s debts. The Prime Minister boasted in a Tory party election broadcast that he was ‘paying down Britain's debts’. But the UK Statistics Authority today wrote to Number 10 pointing out that public net debt has actually risen by £290billion since the coalition was formed. Labour’s Rachel Reeves said the slapdown was ‘hugely embarrassing’ for the PM. The row centres on the difference between the national debt and the deficit. Total national debt – the amount that the UK public sector owes – has risen from £811 billion in 2010 to £1.1 trillion at the end of last year. However, the deficit – the gap between what the Treasury spends and what it receives in taxes – has fallen, from £159.0 billion in 2009-10 to £121.6 billion for 2011-12. In a strongly-worded letter, today Andrew Dilnot, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said politicians must be clear about the difference between the two. ‘It is clearly important for all parties to public debate in this area to understand the relevant statistical definitions and to distinguish changes in the level of debt outstanding from changes in borrowing per period, and to reflect these in their communication of the statistical trends involved,’ he wrote in a letter to the Labour party which he also sent to Downing Street. UK Statistics Authority chairman Andrew Dilnot sent these two graphs to Number 10 to explain how the nation's debts were rising while borrowing had fallen . ‘Public sector net debt is a measure of how much the UK public sector owes at a given time. Public sector net borrowing is the difference between total accrued receipts and total accrued (current and capital) expenditure over a specified period; this measure is frequently used by commentators to summarise the extent of any public sector 'deficit'.’ He added that he was sending a copy of the letter - with accompanying graphs setting out the relevant data - to Mr Cameron's chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn. Miss Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘It is hugely embarrassing for David Cameron that he has had to have the difference between borrowing and debt explained to him by the chair of the UK Statistics Authority. ‘Now that his false claims have been exposed, it's time the Prime Minister stopped deliberately misleading people about his economic record.’","PM boasted in party political broadcast that the government was 'paying down Britain's debts'

Brits only enjoy eight 'real' days of annual leave each year - because the rest of the time is taken up with domestic chores, a study revealed today. Despite having an average allowance of around 24 days a year, researchers have found that the majority of that time is spent catching up on household chores, DIY projects or even doing the weekly food shop. Looking after ill children, attending funerals and even going to medical appointments are also things which eat into Brit's annual leave. And now our lack of holidays - which sees just eight days a year out of our annual leave spent relaxing - has been dubbed 'Vacationitis'. Our lack of holidays sees just eight days a year out of our annual leave spent relaxing . Nearly two thirds claim they are more tired and stressed after a day off because they do anything but relax. The results emerged in a study commissioned by Hilton Hotels & Resorts. Commenting on the findings, psychologist Dr. Linda Papadopoulos said: 'We are working longer hours with over a third of us spending more time with our boss than with our partners or friends. Dr Linda: 'We are spending more time with our boss than with our partners or friends' 'In fact we're still connected to the office even when we've taken annual leave, which means we aren't even getting a break on weekends because were often working. 'These work pressures mean we don't have much down time - and not taking the time to unwind and spend time with friends and family can negatively impact our work- life balance and general well-being. 'In the same way we take responsibility for doing our job well, we also need to take responsibility for our self-care skills, and this involves putting up appropriate boundaries between work and home and also making a concerted effort to take time off, not just to catch up on domestic admin but to genuinely unwind and reconnect with friends and family. With 40 per cent of respondents in the survey noting that vacations are the only real time they get to spend quality time with their families, its important that people are encouraged to use more than the eight out of 24 days annual leave they are currently using and gain a better work-life balance.' The study of 2,000 workers found that each year, they are entitled to take 24 days off work, but just nine days of that is actually spent away on holiday or short breaks. And of that, workers feel that they only relax for just eight days of it due to the travelling. Instead, 40 per cent use some of their time off to catch up on home improvements and DIY while almost a third even take at least one day off each year to shop for birthday or Christmas presents. Around 31 per cent use annual leave to go to medical appointments . Around 32 per cent use part of their annual leave allowance to visit friends or relatives, 31 per cent have to go to medical appointments and 28 per cent even take time off simply to catch up on household chores. A quarter of people take days off to attend funerals or weddings with another 24 per cent using annual leave to look after children who are too ill to attend school or nursery. One in five make use of holiday allowance to go to their children's school events like sports days and Christmas plays while 15 per cent have even had to take time off because their partner was too ill to look after their children. Researchers also revealed that even when Brits do take time out, over half continue to check emails and take calls from the office, with five million people checking emails hourly. Forty per cent of Brits check their work . email during social occasions such as their children's music or dance . performances, at weddings, whilst on a date and even in bed after sex. A depressing 40 per cent use some of their time off to catch up on home improvements and DIY . And among those who have office jobs, two thirds of the UK's workforce find themselves having to work at weekends, despite 85 per cent believing that small breaks help them to be more productive at work. A quarter of respondents have even cancelled annual leave due to work pressures while over half of British workers feel unable to take all of their annual leave because they're either too busy at work, feel guilty or are paranoid due to economic uncertainty. Andrew Flack, vice president, global brand marketing for Hilton Hotels and Resorts, which commissioned the research said: 'Vacationitis appears to be wide-spread, but has definitely hit full-time workers the hardest as they struggle to take time out for some uninterrupted holiday time. 'The traditional two week holiday continues to morph into shorter breaks in the UK, as almost half of the working population take anywhere between four and ten days for their holiday.'

Opponents of Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi brought chaos to the streets of Cairo as they bombarded the presidential palace with petrol bombs. Security forces used tear gas and water cannons to try to control the raging crowd on the eighth day of political violence sweeping the country. Around 6,000 protesters gathered outside the palace in an upscale district of the capital, banging on the gates and throwing stones and shoes into the grounds in a show of contempt. Attack: An Egyptian protester rushes away during clashes in front of the presidential palace in Cairo on as thousands of Egyptians took to the streets to protest . opposition: Around 6,000 protestors marched outside the Cairo palace in a show of opposition to the Islamist President and his Muslim Brotherhood . The protesters accuse Mursi of . betraying the spirit of the revolution by concentrating too much power . in his own hands and those of his Muslim Brotherhood. Crowds chanted 'Leave, leave,' in a clear message to the under-pressure politician. . Security forces inside the palace responded by firing water cannons at the crowd, then volleys of tear gas, injuring at least 15 people. The streets outside the palace became a scene of mayhem as police fired volley after volley of tear gas trying to drive back the protesters, who rained stones on the riot police. 'This is all because of Morsi,' one protester shouted. At least 15 people were injured in the clashes, police said. Thousands more rallied in central Tahrir Square, while a larger crowd marched through the Suez Canal city of Port Said. Defence: Police at the palace responded by firing tear gas and using water canons at the protestors . Injuries: Police said that at least 15 people had been injured in the violent exchanges . The demonstrations mark the second anniversary of the uprising that overthrew Hosni Mubarak. The country's most influential Islamic had attempted to ease tensions by . gathering rival political leaders for crisis talks on Thursday. He persuaded them to sign up to a charter disavowing violence and . committing to dialogue, after the head of the army to warn this week that the state was on the verge of collapse. But the talks were overshadowed when the President's opponents called for nationwide protests. The Muslim Brotherhood accuses Mursi's . opponents of trying to bring down Egypt's first democratically elected . leader and to seize power through street unrest. In a statement released last night, . leftist leader Hamdeen Sabahi said signing the peace initiative did not . mean an end to the protests. He said he would not enter dialogue until bloodshed . was halted, the state of emergency lifted and those responsible for the . previous week's violence brought to justice. Leave: A protestor accidentally catches outside the palace, where demonstrators chanted 'leave, leave' Fatal: The wave of political demonstration is in its eighth day, with 60 people have been killed . The rise of Mursi, an elected . Islamist, after generations of rule by authoritarian, secular military . men in the most populous Arab state, is seen as one of the most significant results of the Arab Spring. But his tenure has failed . to unite Egyptians and protests have made the country seem all but . ungovernable. The instability has worsened an economic crisis, forcing . Cairo to drain currency reserves to prop up its pound. Recent violence has been worst in cities along the Suez Canal, especially Port Said, where demonstrators were enraged by death sentences given to 21 football fans for involvement in fatal stadium riots last year. Dozens of protesters were shot dead in Port Said and Mursi responded by imposing a state of emergency and curfew. Brotherhood supporters battled protesters outside the presidential palace during protests against Mursi in December. Revolution: Opponents accuse Mursi of concentrating too much power in his own hands following the revolution two years ago . Protests: Thousands more rallied in central Tahrir Square, while a larger crowd marched through the Suez Canal city of Port Said . Collapse: Clashes led the head of the army to warn that the state could be on the verge of collapse . Critics accused the Brotherhood of deploying a militia against the demonstrators, but keen to avoid a repeat, the Islamists have so far kept off the streets during the latest wave of protests. Thursday's meeting of political leaders was convened by Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayyeb, head of the 1,000-year-old al-Azhar university and mosque, one of the few institutions still seen as neutral. He persuaded participants to sign a document pledging to renounce violence and agree to set up a committee to plan more talks. That marked a climbdown by Mursi's foes who had previously rebuffed invitations to negotiate, demanding that Mursi first promise to include them in a unity government. The presidency said the initiative was 'an important step on the road to achieving stability in the Egyptian street'. But it is far from clear that opposition politicians could call off the street demonstrations, even if they wanted to. The protest movement has become a spontaneous expression of anger, often only loosely allied to the secularist and liberal parties running against the Brotherhood in elections.","6,000 protestors marched outside Mohamed Mursi's palace in Cairo .

It may sound potty, but whistling to your baby could have him toilet-trained before he can walk. A study of Vietnamese families credited whistling with getting babies out of nappies by just nine months. By the age of two, when many British toddlers are yet to start potty training, the Vietnamese children were managing the entire process by themselves. Swedish researchers said potty training started almost from birth, with mothers making a whistling sound when their child gave a sign that they needed to go. A study of Vietnamese families credited whistling with getting babies out of nappies by just nine months . The children associated the whistling with urinating, and by the age of nine months, they were able to keep dry – as long as they were regularly reminded to sit on their potty, the Journal of Pediatric Urology reports. The researchers said that while Western babies are potty trained later now than in the past, early toilet training has traditionally been regarded as a badge of pride in Vietnam. They added that as well as saving on the cost of nappies and the time spent changing them, learning to control the bladder very early in life may be better for urinary health. In the past, potty training often started before the age of one. But today’s mothers are advised to wait until their child is 18 months to two years old - and many begin even later.

"Geely pledges to retain group's 107 staff and factory in Coventry . By . Matt Blake . PUBLISHED: . 09:34 EST, 1 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:38 EST, 1 February 2013 . It can be hard enough to make a London black cab driver take you south of the river, but it now turns out they are more than willing to go East. The firm that manufactures the distinctive London taxi, has been saved from the brink of extinction by a company in China, in a deal worth £11 million. Coventry-based Manganese Bronze was today acquired by Chinese private car maker Geely, which owned a 20 per cent stake in the firm before it collapsed into administration last October. Manganese hit the wall after recalling 500 black cabs due to a steering box fault, which came on top of mounting losses at the group. Distinctive: The firm that manufactures the distinctive London taxi, have been bought out of administration by a company in China, in a deal worth £11 million . Geely pledged to retain the group's 107 staff and existing manufacturing site in Coventry. But 156 jobs have already been axed since Manganese called in administrators. The deal was welcomed by Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London. He said: 'I am delighted that Geely has successfully secured the future of the London Taxi Company, ensuring the continuing manufacture of a world famous, fully accessible and instantly recognisable vehicle synonymous with London.' Saved: Manganese Bronze, whose factory is in Coventry, has been acquired by Chinese private automaker Geely . Jobs secured: The group's London Taxi Company division makes about 2,700 cabs a year and has produced more than 100,000 since it started in 1948 . Hard times: 156 jobs have already been axed since Manganese called in administrators in October . The group said it hopes to resume production as soon as possible following the deal. Geely said it was 'confident' of being able to create new jobs and plans new taxi models with improved energy efficiency, while it is also looking at launching into the private hire market. Li Shufu, chairman of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said the firm has 'ambitious plans' for the business. Trouble brewing: Manganese, which traces its roots back to the 19th century as a maker of ship propellers, was thrown into turmoil last autumn when it discovered a defect with new steering boxes in its TX4 models . 'Despite its recent difficulties, we have long believed that the company and the 'black cab' have huge potential,' he added. Manganese, which traces its roots back to the 19th century as a maker of ship propellers, was thrown into turmoil last autumn when it discovered a defect with new steering boxes in its TX4 models, which were introduced in production at its Coventry factory late last February. Chinese cabs: Geely's new taxi design is unveiled in China last November. While the holding company will be known as Geely UK, the new owner said it will retain the London Taxi International brand . Confident: Geely said it was 'confident' of being able to create new jobs and plans new taxi models with improved energy efficiency, while it is also looking at launching into the private hire market . The group was forced to suspend production and repair and replace all affected models, but said all the cabs which were recalled are now fixed and back on the road. Its London Taxi arm was already suffering amid a consumer spending slowdown and increased rivalry from competitors, such as Eco City vehicles, and Manganese had been loss-making for the past four years. The group's London Taxi Company division makes about 2,700 cabs a year and has produced more than 100,000 since it started in 1948. Its newest model, the TX4, was launched in October 2006. Following today's takeover, Geely chief financial officer Daniel Li will become chairman of the Geely UK and Peter Johansen, formerly group finance director of Manganese Bronze, will be appointed executive vice president of the Black Cab operation.

The new drug called cerebrolysin improves concentration, memory processing and mood in patients . Dementia sufferers may benefit from a ‘promising’ new treatment made from pigs’ brains, say researchers. The new drug - called cerebrolysin - improves concentration, memory processing and mood in patients with a certain kind of dementia known as vascular dementia, which affects up to 200,000 Britons. No treatment has yet been specifically developed for vascular dementia. But the new drug is licensed in some countries for dementia, stroke and traumatic brain injury - although not yet here or in the US. Researcher Li He of the Department of Neurology at Sichuan University in Sichuan, China, said ‘Our review suggests that Cerebrolysin can help improve cognitive and global function in patients with mild to moderate severity vascular dementia.’ Cerebrolysin is a drug made from pig brain proteins that has produced some positive results from small vascular dementia trials. Larger trials are now underway. But the drug is not easy to administer, with regular intravenous infusions necessary, says the review. The review analysed the most up-to-date evidence from six trials involving 597 people. All were given Cerebrolysin intravenously in different daily concentrations and for different treatment periods, from a few weeks to three years, depending on the trial. Compared to standard care alone or placebos (dummy treatments), Cerebrolysin significantly improved brain function based on testing recall, arithmetic or other cognitive abilities. It had a small positive effect on patients’ overall clinical state and mood. Long-term treatment may have greater benefits, although most of the trials were short. Vascular dementia is a common form of dementia caused by damage to the network of blood vessels supplying the brain affecting up to one in four of 800,000 dementia sufferers in the UK. Some symptoms are similar to Alzheimer’s disease and stroke but people with vascular dementia often experience difficulty thinking quickly, concentrating and communicating, as well as seizures and severe confusion. Dr He said: ‘The results are promising but due to low numbers of trials, inconsistencies between trials, risk of bias in the way some of the trials were conducted and lack of long-term follow-up, we cannot yet recommend Cerebrolysin as a routine treatment for vascular dementia.’ No serious side effects were reported due to taking the drug. Dr He said ‘This indicates to us that Cerebrolysin is safe and well tolerated by patients with vascular dementia. But the fact that it has to be given in regular intravenous infusions means it could be impractical for use on a large scale.’ The director of research at Alzheimer¿s Research UK said developments in new research was 'absolutely vital' Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said ‘Cochrane systematic reviews are an incredibly valuable tool, as they pull together the best available evidence on a particular treatment or intervention. ‘This review found that Cerebrolysin does appear to have some cognitive benefits for people with vascular dementia, although it is not clear how these might translate into day-to-day improvements in people’s lives. ‘It is positive to see potential new treatments tested in people, but larger clinical trials are needed before we could know whether Cerebrolysin could be a feasible treatment option for people with the condition. ‘Vascular dementia affects thousands of people in the UK, but sadly there are no specific treatments available for people with the condition. Research into new treatments is absolutely vital, but without continued investment, promising findings cannot be taken forward. We must ensure that research into dementia remains a national priority.’ Jessica Smith, research officer at the Alzheimer’s Society, said ‘This review is interesting but highlights the lack of research into Vascular dementia. If we are to really understand whether Cerebrolysin can be potentially be used to treat people more research is needed into its long term effects. ‘Vascular dementia is the second most common form of the condition affecting around a quarter of all people with dementia. 'While other forms of dementia have seen progress in research, there is currently no treatment for vascular dementia. ‘We desperately need more research and more funding for research if we are to develop effective interventions for all forms of dementia.’","The new drug called cerebrolysin improves concentration, memory and mood among those suffering with vascular dementia .

A teenage girl was mown down by an elderly motorist days after he refused to surrender his driving licence to police despite failing an eyesight test. Cassie McCord, 16, was on her way to college when 87-year-old Colin Horsfall’s car ploughed into her. CCTV images showed how Horsfall’s red Vauxhall Astra veered on to the pavement and narrowly missed two pedestrians before regaining the road, then mounting the pavement again a few yards further on, hitting Cassie. She died from severe head injuries the next day and Horsfall, a bachelor, died three months later, having never recovered from injuries he sustained in the crash. The tragedy happened in Colchester three days after the pensioner drove into trees when he missed the entrance to a petrol station. Police discovered he could not read a car registration from 20 metres – the  legal minimum. They advised him not to drive while his details were sent to the DVLA but were not able to seize his licence. A coroner yesterday recorded that Cassie was unlawfully killed and Horsfall’s death was an accident. The hearing in Chelmsford was told that police were called to a Tesco petrol station in Highwoods, Colchester, on February 4 last year after Horsfall’s first accident.PC Daniel Bellingham did an on-the-spot eye test which revealed he could see only 16.2 metres – about 53ft. Scroll down for video . Colin Horsfall was caught on CCTV veering onto the pavement moments before he killed Cassie McCord in Colchester, Essex . The 87-year-old narrowly avoided hitting pedestrians as he mounted the pavement. Moments later he knocked down Cassie . The officer drove him home to nearby Rowhedge and spent two hours trying to convince him not to drive again while he submitted details to the DVLA. He said: ‘Mr Horsfall asked if he was permitted to drive. I told him he would be better off not doing so but he asked me again directly if he was allowed.’ Horsfall drove into Colchester town centre on a shopping trip on the morning of February 7. Witness Adam Hart, who works in a bookshop, was being dropped off by his wife. He said: ‘A red Vauxhall Astra mounted the pavement. It went back on to the road then went back on to the pavement and collided with two girls.’ Mr Hart said his wife had thought it must . have been a fugitive being pursued. ‘The car seemed to be going . incredibly fast, especially considering it was on the pavement. I didn’t . see any brake lights.’ Paramedics tend to Cassie after she was knocked down. She died the following day in hospital . Cassie's mother Jackie (left) paid tribute to a 'bubbly, vibrant girl', while many pople left flowers at the scene . Cassie’s family have urged the public to support a campaign set up in her memory.Her mother, Jackie, has launched a petition calling for a change in the law in the wake of the death of her daughter (pictured). Mrs McCord says no-one else should go through a tragic loss as a result of a legal loophole. Cassie's Law is campaiging for the Government to give police new powers to seize a driving licence if they consider the driver unfit. It would then be down to the DVLA to decide whether the licence is returned or revoked. Mrs McCord said: ‘I feel as frustrated as the police that they were not able to hold on to Colin Horsfall's licence. 'If they had been able to do so my daughter would have been alive today. I urge everybody to support Cassie's Law and we will carry on until there is a change in the law.' So far about 10,000 people have signed the petition and Mrs McCord hopes to lobby the Government later this year to change the law. Cassie, who was studying five AS . levels at Colchester Sixth Form College and hoped to become a lawyer, . was pinned against a shop front. The teenager, who lived with her . mother Jackie and brother Sam, 20, was taken to hospital where her . life-support machine was switched off the next day. Horsfall, a retired shipwright, died . on May 13, having never recovered from the injuries he sustained in the . crash, which a police investigator put down to ‘unintended . acceleration’. Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray  said: ‘The manner of his driving was extremely reckless.’ Horsfall had no family members at the inquest and his brother Terry, 74, declined to comment. Mrs McCord, a job centre manager, said . the family were still trying to come to terms with their loss, adding: . ‘Cassie was a much-loved, vibrant, bubbly girl.’ She used the hearing to call for . support for a campaign she has launched, supported by police and her . local MP, for the law to be changed so that police can seize the car of . someone unfit to drive. She has already collected 10,000 signatures. ‘Colin Horsfall was a selfish man,’ she said. ‘He knew he was unfit to drive but that didn’t stop him. I . feel as frustrated as the police that they were not able to hold on to . his licence. If they had been able to, Cassie would be alive today.’ Sergeant Kevin May, of Essex Police’s . serious collision investigation unit, added: ‘I totally support Cassie’s . Law. We can seize the car if there’s someone driving without insurance. Why can’t we do so for someone who is unfit to drive?’ Road Safety Minister Mike  Penning . said police already have the power to arrest any driver  who poses a . threat to himself or others and cases can be fast-tracked to courts . which can withdraw licences.

Modern pesticides widely used by British farmers could be restricted over concerns they are responsible for a decline in bee populations. The European Commission said neonicotinoids, insecticides often applied directly to seed so the crop grows up resistant to pests, should be banned from use on 'flowering crops' for the next two years. One of the main uses of the pesticide is oilseed rape, which honey bees commonly feed on, as well as sugar beet and even ornamental plants. Bee killer: Neonicotinoids, a widely used type of pesticide, may be banned as it could be the cause of a decline in honey bees . A January review by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found neonicotinoids are a threat to bees and should not be used on plants they are attracted to. The EU's commissioner for health and consumer policy, Tonio Borg, has now called for 'swift and decisive action' and proposed to restrict three types of the popular pesticides from as early as July. 'We are requesting member states suspend for two years the use of this pesticide on seeds, granulates and sprays for crops which attract bees,' Commission spokesman Frederic Vincent said. And Britain was yesterday accused of opposing the restrictions by environmental groups, who called for immediate action. Earlier this week, leading DIY and garden stores announced they would stop selling the pesticide, which is linked to the steady decline of bee populations, and are known to affect the creatures' nervous system with fatal results. Warning: The European Commission's report recommends a ban on the widely used pesticides . B&Q says it will no longer stock pesticide containing the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, because of 'concerns about the potential for harm', while Homebase has followed. Separately, Wickes said it is to replace a product containing the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam, later this year. Stop: Many British DIY stores have now stopped selling neonicotinoids, including Homebase and B&Q . Introduced in the 1990s, the pesticides are based on nicotine and contain compounds which are thought to interfere with the bees' central nervous system, which has an impact on their memory and ability to find their way back home. Although bumblebees were already in decline, their numbers have fallen faster and honey bee populations are thought to have halved since the 1980s in Britain. German chemical giant Bayer which manufactures neonicotinoid treatments earlier this week insisted that there was no need for them to be banned. Marco Contiero, from Greenpeace, said Britain was firmly opposed to restrictions, while advocacy group Avaaz condemned 'spurious' British and German opposition. Speaking this week, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: 'It's important that we take action based upon scientific evidence rather than making knee-jerk decisions that could have significant knock-on impacts. 'That's why we are carrying out our own detailed field research to ensure we can make a decision about neonicotinoids based on the most up-to-date and complete evidence available.' But campaigners welcomed the proposals put out by the Commission. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns Andrew Pendleton said: 'This hugely significant EU proposal promises a first, important step on the road to turning around the decline in our bees. The UK Government must throw its weight behind it. 'The evidence linking neonicotinoid chemicals to declining bee populations is growing. We can't afford to ignore the threat they pose to these crucial pollinators. 'It is time to put farmers and nature before pesticide company profits. Ministers must act quickly to support safe and effective alternatives to chemical insecticides - and bring these forward as part of a National Bee Action Plan.'","European Commisson recommends ban on pesticides blamed for bee deaths .

Fireman: Daniel Armitage, 41, committed suicide by lying down in traffic just four days after he was probed for alleged domestic assault, officials said . Mr Armitage was being investigated for domestic assault on New Year’s Day and that probe is still going on, reported the Ann Arbor Journal. He pulled over at 6:30am last Thursday on I-696 and the spare tyre was placed next to his white SUV, reported the Detroit Free Press. But investigators found the tyre still on the SUV had enough pressure to drive on it, although two lug nuts had been removed. However none of the other lug nuts were loosened, which was strange as this is usually done to all of them on a tyre  when a car is jacked up. Witnesses said he was lying down in the right lane of traffic and his SUV was parked with its lights flashing, reported the Detroit Free Press.

Death scene: Witnesses said he was lying down in the right lane of traffic and his white BMW SUV, pictured bottom, was parked with its lights flashing . A father and his two children were hurt when their vehicle was forced into the central reservation. The road was closed for more than six hours. Police will not release details of the alleged domestic abuse incident until their investigation of Mr Armitage’s death is complete. A funeral is being held for Mr Armitage, of Bloomfield Township, Michigan, on Tuesday at St Hugo of the Hills Church in Bloomfield Hills. Mr Armitage had been a fireman in Ann Arbor, a city around 45 miles west of Detroit, for almost 17 years. He was off-duty at the time of his death. His wife was hospitalised last week at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, but there has been no update on her condition.

Belief: Conservative MP Helen Grant said she was a 'God-fearing woman' and that gay marriage plans were consistent with her beliefs . Gay marriage is consistent with Christian values of ‘justice’ and ‘fairness’, the equalities minister has told religious critics. Helen Grant said she was a ‘God-fearing woman’ and suggested those of faith should support Government plans to legalise gay unions. Speaking ahead of a key vote on the issue next week, in which 100 Conservative MPs are expected to refuse to back the reform, Mrs Grant dismissed the idea that there was no mandate for it since it was not included in the party’s general election manifesto. She said the proposal was in a ‘contract for equalities’ published at the same time as the manifesto in 2010 and it was ‘quite clear what our intentions may well be’. ‘I am a God-fearing woman. My faith is very fundamental to everything I do and think. 'I am a member of the Church of England, a Christian, and my faith is very, very important to me,’ the Tory minister said in an interview with political magazine The House. ‘I think it’s [same-sex marriage] absolutely consistent with my beliefs. 'For me, as a Christian, I see it as about justice, equality, fairness, ending discrimination and opening up marriage to more people on the basis that marriage is a very special institution.’ Mrs Grant said the Government would make sure there was ‘proper protection’ in place for religious organisations and ministers who do not want to perform same-sex marriages. And she insisted that Tories who voted against gay marriage next week would not be damaging the party’s image.

An amateur dramatic society is finally staging its production of a musical tackling immigration and racial prejudice - after taking two years to find any black actors. Milton Musical Society, which is based in New Milton, Hampshire, had decided to produce Ragtime, set in 1902 New York  - but the theatrical group had no black people among its 80 members. The only black person they knew working in the market town was a pharmacist - who did not sing or act - and the group’s committee said it would be inappropriate to allow white actors to ‘black-up’. Showtime: The cast of the Ragtime in Hampshire, which stars Nicole Northern and Alexander Clarke (front) Members had to go on a recruitment drive, . including approaching certain black people they spotted at work or out . shopping. They finally found their leading man and lady from towns 30 . miles away. The society had hoped to stage the . show last year but had to postpone it upon failing to fill the 10 black . roles in time. But it now has three black men and three black women in a . 55-strong cast. Society member Jonathan Shiner, 61, . said: ‘New Milton and the surrounding areas have largely white . populations, which is reflected in our membership. ‘When we are looking for a white man . or a white girl we have 100,000 options and therefore rarely have . trouble filling these roles. Practice: The cast of Ragtime the musical in rehearsals. It took two years to find black actors for the show . Teamwork: Milton Musical Society decided to produce the musical, which looks at immigration and racism . ‘However, with Ragtime, we need . around 10 black performers, who are able to sing and act to a high . standard. Unfortunately, there are very few black families in our . catchment area to begin with. ‘By the time you take out those who . are the wrong age or wrong gender and those who cannot sing and act we . lose a further 90 per cent. The odds of finding the right people are . stacked against us.’ He added: ‘We discussed the option of . blacking up early on but dismissed it immediately because it is not . appropriate in modern theatre practice. ‘You could put white people in the . shadows and pretend they are black, or have them on stage as a . silhouette, but we want to do it properly. Ideally, we would like 10 . black actors and actresses.’ Jazz hands: After two years Milton Musical Society have filled all the roles for Ragtime, which will be on in April . Instructions: Nicole Northern (left) and Alexander Clarke (right) pictured with director John Teather (centre) Leading man Alex Clarke, 48, who . plays Coalhouse Walker, said: ‘It's been a struggle finding black people . from this area to fill the roles. 'I've got about 5,000 friends or . followers on Facebook and I promoted the musical on there in a bid to find actors but we have still not got all we would like. ‘Most of my black friends and . followers are from larger cities, rather than rural Hampshire and . Dorset. Everybody at the society has been incredibly friendly and very . welcoming.’ Southampton-based race consultant Don . John said: ‘There are not many black people living in this part of the . country, so I understand why the society has had some difficulty filling . the roles. ‘It's very brave of the society to . stand by their principles and not go down the easy route of allowing . white actors to black-up. Musical posters: The society's committee refused to let white actors 'black-up' after deeming it inappropriate . Finally on: The society had hoped to stage the show last year but failed to fill the 10 black roles in time . ‘Letting white actors black-up would . be totally inappropriate. Some people might be outraged at white people . blacking-up but I think we have moved beyond that now.’ The Milton Musical Society was forced to cancel a production called The Top of the Pops Years last year in the wake of the Jimmy Savile (right) sex scandal. The show was due to be performed at a local hall in November but organisers decided to scrap it following complaints by the public. The group had already spend thousands of pounds promoting the show with materials featuring Savile. All tickets were refunded. The 400-seater theatre at the Regent . Centre, in Christchurch, Dorset, will host five performances of the . musical, with tickets costing £14.50 each. Rehearsals started one month . ago. The society's show posters say: ‘This . show follows the explosive relationships as immigrants arrive on the . great liners to a new land already struggling with racial harmony and . injustice. 'This real-life drama, set at . the turn of the century, follows the struggle of the black community to . assert their independence from the white community, against a . background of the country flooded with European immigrants hungry for a . new life, and industrial and civil strife.’","Milton Musical Society will stage musical Ragtime set in 1902 New York .

Health and safety bosses have banned postmen from wearing shorts during the winter months in case they get frostbite. More than 200 hardy postmen were told they must wear trousers as part of their uniform when working in freezing temperatures. Postal workers said the ban was introduced after a postman fell over during last month's cold snap and grazed his leg. Ban: Postmen at a depot in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, have been banned from wearing shorts by bosses during the winter months (stock) The shorts ban has been introduced at the Royal Mail depot in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. But postmen said they preferred to wear shorts during their ten-mile rounds, even in the most bitter conditions, to keep their legs cool. One worker at the depot, who asked not to be named, said angry staff members had planned to contact the Communication Workers' Union about the ban. He said: 'We're all disgusted about it. I find wearing shorts much more comfortable as I feel more restricted in trousers and my legs do get warm. 'There's an agreement between Royal Mail and the union which stipulates the rules about uniforms and there's nothing saying you can't wear shorts. 'I'm very annoyed - I can't stand wearing trousers when I'm on the go all the time.' Guidance: Staff said they planned to contact their union about the ban, but Royal Mail said it was only 'guidance' and has now been 'rescinded' The ban came about when one postman slipped and grazed his leg with ice spikes that were attached to his boots for extra grip. Royal Mail spokesman Adrian Booth said: 'Our priority is for the health and safety of our staff and risks of frostbite and chapped skin should not be taken lightly. 'Following a local incident in which a colleague was injured in a fall, we advised our staff in the Cheltenham area not to wear shorts, to reduce the risk of injury during severe local weather.

When applying for a job under a fake identity, it is important to make sure that, at the very least, you have a water-tight cover story. So when dead terrorist 'Osama Bin Laden' answered an advert for a teaching post at an Indian primary school last year, citing Bill Clinton as his father, it did not take long for teachers to unravel his masquerade. He was one of hundreds of bizarre false names given by chancers apparently hoping to secure jobs in schools in Uttar Pradesh, in northern India. Perhaps the so-called 'Abcdefgh' thought he would stand a . better chance of teaching children English when he told India's Ministry of . Education that his father's name was Xyz. Most candidates will not make it through to even the final stages of selection for primary school vacancies . Or maybe bow-wielding Hindu deity Jai Sri Ram thought he needed a break from heavenly duties to help boost the state's religious education results. There was even one aspirant who gave his name as Farji, which translates as 'fake'. His father's name was given as Farji Singh. And unsurprisingly, all these applicants had spotless academic records to boot, with 100 per cent marks in all exams. When dead terrorist 'Osama bin Laden', left, applied for a teaching post at an Indian primary school last year, citing Bill Clinton, right, as his father, it did not take long for teachers to unravel his masquerade . But rather than dismiss the applications out of hand, the state's basic education department allotted them all registration numbers and and even issued letters for counselling on their 'fake' addresses. Such aspirants, shortlisted in the first list of candidates for the primary teachers' job, have made the state's basic education department's recruitment drive a laughing stock. The candidates have clearly fudged every detail, from name and address to  their exam records. Incredibly, the screening of the applications, filled online, found over 60 per cent of candidates to be fake. For 72,825 vacant posts of primary teachers, more than 70 lakh applications were received of which only about 20 are believed to be genuine. Minister of state for basic education Waseem Ahmad said the department would sort out the errors. 'This system of receiving online applications and sorting it out by software was meant for observing complete transparency. 'Maybe there are some problems but they will be sorted out in coming days,' he was quoted as saying. Interestingly, many of the candidates have claimed to have consistently . secured more than 95 per cent marks in all exams. A . senior employee of the department said: 'The problem is that only fake . candidates can be called for first and second counselling because their . total marks are shown as between 95 per cent and 100 per cent. 'Obviously . such candidates will not turn up. But who will be answerable for the . money and resources spent on shortlisting the applicants? 'It would have been better if the department had made it mandatory for the applicants to enclose all their educational certificates.' However, Sanjay Sinha, secretary of the basic education board, said: 'We are still in the process of making a final merit list. 'The fake names would obviously be deleted during the final counselling of the aspirants. In that case, the next genuine candidate in the merit list will be given the opportunity.' Since the vacancy for primary teachers was announced district- wise, lakhs of candidates from over 20 districts applied with the hope of being selected for the job. The application was invited online and the cut off list of each district was supposed to vary according to the marks obtained by the applicants there. But, the software couldn't detect and cancel many forms with fake details. Also, it could not discard more than one form filled by the same applicant. As a result of it, the same applicants have been allotted many registrations numbers.","He is one of hundreds of false names given by applicants in Uttar Pradesh .

The uniquely human phenomenon of crying when we are overcome by emotion developed as a means to communicate our feelings before the emergence of language, an influential scientist claims. Michael Trimble, a professor of neurology, suggests that there must have been a time in our evolution when tears took on a meaning beyond their simple bio-mechanical function - keeping the eyeballs moist. He has written a new book - Why Humans Like To Cry - that attempts to shed light on the mystery of why our species is the only one in the animal kingdom to shed tears of anguish. Why do we cry? Shedding tears in response to emotion seems to be a uniquely human phenomenon. A UCL professor's new book claims that it emerged as a way to communicate before oral language . The work, according to its publisher, offers a wide-ranging discussion of emotional crying, looking at its physiology as well as its evolutionary past. Biologically, tears are needed to keep the eyeball moist and they contain proteins and other substances to keep it healthy and fight infections. In every other animal that seems to be extent of their function, but in humans, crying takes on a whole new, additional significance. We can shed tears of joy and tears of anger and for a whole range of other emotions. But, most commonly, we shed tears of sadness. Anguish: Professor Michael Trimble that the emergence of emotional crying is connected with the dawning of self-consciousness . Professor Trimble, of University College London's Institute of Neurology, said it was this uniquely communicative nature of human crying that led him to investigate the phenomenon. 'Humans cry for many reasons,' he told Scientific American. 'But crying for emotional reasons and crying in response to aesthetic experiences are unique to us. 'The former is most associated with loss and bereavement, and the art forms that are most associated with tears are music, literature and poetry. 'There are very few people who cry looking at paintings, sculptures or lovely buildings. But we also have tears of joy the associated feelings of which last a shorter time than crying in the other circumstances.' Professor Trimble said he hopes his . work will release many, especially men, from the reluctance they feel to . be seen shedding tears. They are a natural repsonse to not only suffering, but also to feeling compassion for others, he said. He . added: 'We should not be afraid of our emotions, especially those . related to compassion, since our ability to feel empathy and with that . to cry tears, is the foundation of a morality and culture which is . exclusively human.' Assessing the phenomenon from the perspective of neuroscience, Professor Trimble suggests that the crying in this way must have emerged in humans at a specific evolutionary turning point. He believes that the emergence of emotional crying is connected with the dawning of self-consciousness and the development of a theory of mind - when early humans first realised their peers were also self-conscious beings. This, he claims, led to the realisation that the self and others can suffer, feel sadness - and disappear. 'Attachment emotionally to others, with the development of sophisticated facial gestures associated with suffering, and with loss and bereavement ensued,' he said. Why Humans Like To Cry is published by Oxford University Press, priced at £16.99 for hardback.","UCL Professor attempts to shed light on the mystery of why humans cry .

The gay marriage Bill was launched yesterday amid fears that it fails to protect registrars, hospital chaplains and even teachers from being sued if they reject same-sex unions. David Cameron is pressing ahead with the draft law despite fierce opposition from within his own ranks. Several cabinet ministers have already indicated they would vote against the Bill and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has raised concerns about the ‘robustness’ of protection for faiths. Fears: A Department for Education source fears that teachers could face the sack if they make a stand against gay marriage despite reassurances from Michael Gove that they would not be punished for their views . Uncertain: Decisions on whether to sack teachers for their views on gay marriage could be down to the European Court of Human Rights and not the Government according to a Department for Education source . Some senior Tories say the Prime . Minister is in danger of splitting the party over the Bill just days . after he managed to unite it by announcing a referendum on Europe. Under the draft law published . yesterday, gay couples will have the right to marry in civil or . religious ceremonies if the faith in question chooses to carry it out. Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who is . also minister for equalities, said it would ensure ‘equal and fair’ treatment for gay couples. She said: ‘Marriage is a hugely . important institution in this country – one which has changed throughout . our history, and continues to change. The values of marriage bind . families and communities together. ‘In opening up marriage to same-sex . couples we will further strengthen the importance of marriage in our . society. This Bill protects and promotes religious freedom, so all . religious organisations can act according to their doctrines and . beliefs.’ Tory MPs who oppose the law say there . is no guarantee that faith groups and public sector workers could not be . sued under equalities legislation – and be defeated in the European . Court of Human Rights. Some argue that teachers and other . staff who do not support gay marriage could be punished for failing to . promote it. A Department for  Education source claimed it may be . difficult to prevent those with traditional views being dismissed. Support: Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, is in favour of the gay marriage bill fast tracked by David Cameron, right, but strongly supports the right of teachers to disagree . The measures will also allow civil partners to convert their partnership into a marriage. There is also special protection for . the Church of England and Church in Wales, making it illegal for their . clergy to carry out gay weddings. Mrs Miller said if the Churches change . their stance at a later date, the law can be amended. The cost of the . legislation to the public sector would be £3.3million to £4.7million. MPs will get a chance to debate the Bill next month and it is likely to be a combative session. David Cameron has attempted to head . off a rebellion by giving Conservative MPs a free vote, but Labour and . the Liberal Democrats are likely to team up with the Government in . favour. Tory MP Stewart Jackson argued that . unlike other issues of conscience such as the Hunting Bill and the Human . Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, the detail would not be examined in . the Commons because of the swift timetable for getting it through. Instead it will be scrutinised by a parliamentary committee. He said: ‘Those Bills on important . issues of conscience were fully scrutinised on the floor of the House of . Commons but they want to rush this one through, which will do nothing . to allay concerns about the protection of religious groups, . schoolteachers, health workers and other public sector workers.’ David Burrowes MP said the Bill ‘does . not provide adequate protection for freedom of conscience’: ‘Challenges . could be made in the UK courts which would run a coach and horses . through these so-called protections and we have already seen religious . freedoms are not protected by the European Court of Human Rights.’ Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice President of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales, said: ‘Alongside many people of all . faiths and none we will be vigorously opposing the Bill.’ Right and wrong: Mr Cameron with his mother Mary . Even David Cameron’s mother is not convinced about the merits of his gay marriage plans.Mary Cameron, 78, was asked at a lunch why her son was pressing head with the legislation which had alienated many grassroots Tories and said: ‘I know, David just won’t be told’. The policy was also heavily criticised by local activists and some Tory MPs, but Mr Cameron sees it as central to his modernisation drive. He told MPs: ‘I don’t support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.’ Mrs Cameron, 78, is a retired magistrate who once said her work had helped her to teach her son about right and wrong. A biography of the Prime Minister described the family as ‘old fashioned’ and said his stockbroker father Ian was a churchwarden and his mother helped arrange the flowers. Mrs Cameron, who was born Mary Mount, previously said that Mr Cameron was never short of an opinion, even when he was only five. In an interview during the 2010 election campaign she said that friends would beg for him to ‘shut up’. She added: ‘He always had something to say’. Mr Cameron said of her: ‘My mother was a mum at home as it were, but she was a magistrate in the local courts in Newbury, and I always admired her sort of sense of public service and responsibility and putting something back. She is a wonderful mum.’","David Cameron is pressing ahead with draft law despite fierce opposition .

A Good Samaritan who witnessed the incident decided to trail the 20-year-old, placing a call to 911 at the same time. Witness: This Good Samaritan, who declined to be identified, was integral in tracking down the young woman and reporting the alleged crime . ‘I’m actually just following a car that just hit a man on Collins Avenue,’ the man said on 911 tapes, which were released today. ‘As far as I know, at this time, she must have killed him.’ The witness described Tomica as being ‘really drunk’ at the time of the incident. According to NBC Miami, the witness followed Tomica back to her apartment, further down Collins Avenue. The affidavit states that upon reaching her apartment, the young woman got out of her vehicle, handed the keys to a valet, and went into her apartment. When officers arrived at her apartment, they said in their report that Tomica had slurred speech and smelled of alcohol. She was pictured by NBC Miami being led from her apartment into custody, mascara streaks marring her face. Tomica is pictured in tears in her booking photo, clutching her hands into fists below her face. She was charged with driving while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident, but was later freed on $10,000 bond. It is unclear if she has an attorney.

Almost 150 years after it failed to return to port after its successful maiden mission, experts believe they may have finally solved the mysterious loss of the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley during the Civil War. Scientists at Clemson University's Warren Lasch Conservation Center in North Charleston are set to publish their findings today on why the first submarine in history to sink an enemy warship perished along with its target in the waters off South Carolina in 1864. Located in 1995 and raised five years later to be placed in a controlled environment to preserve it, speculation around the loss of the revolutionary submarine centers on the very explosives it planted on the Union blockade ship USS Housatonic. Scroll down for video . The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sits in a conservation tank at a conservation lab in North Charleston, South Carolina . Scientists say a pole on the front of the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley designed to ram explosives into enemy ships may hold the key clue to its sinking during the Civil War. The pole, called a spar, was once placed at the front of the sub and used to place a powder charge into the Housatonic, but the Hunley went down with its eight man crew and never returned on February 17th 1864. And earlier this month, the submarine was unveiled in full and unobstructed for the first time on Thursday, capping a decade of careful preservation. 'No one alive has ever seen the Hunley complete,' said engineer John King as the crane at the Charleston conservation laboratory slowly lifted a massive steel truss covering the top of the submarine on January 12th. Scientists say a pole on the front of the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley designed to plant explosives on enemy ships may hold a key clue to its sinking during the Civil War . The USS Housatonic was sunk by the H.L. Hunley in February of 1864 off the coast of South Caroline . About 20 engineers and scientists applauded as they caught the first glimpse of the intact 42-foot-long narrow iron cylinder, which was raised from the ocean floor near Charleston more than a decade ago. The public will see the same view but in a water tank to keep it from rusting. 'It's like looking at the sub for the first time. It's like the end of a long night,' said Paul Mardikian, senior conservator since 1999 of the project to raise, excavate and conserve the Hunley. In the summer of 2000, an expedition led by adventurer Clive Cussler raised the Hunley and delivered it to the conservatory on Charleston's old Navy base, where it sat in a 90,000-gallon tank of fresh water to leech salt out of its iron hull. On weekdays, scientists drain the tank and work on the sub. On weekends, tourists who before this week could only see an obstructed view of the vessel in the water tank, now will be able to see it unimpeded. Considered the Confederacy's stealth weapon, the Hunley sank the Union warship Housatonic in winter 1864, and then disappeared with all eight Confederate sailors inside.

Hunley Clemson University's Warren Lasch Conservation Center in North Charleston, South Carolina  as conservation crew members work on the Civil War submarine (right) The Hunley was the secret weapon of the Confederacy and the world's first submarine to sink an enemy ship.It attacked and sank the Union warship Housatonic on the night of February 17, 1864, and then disappeared . The narrow, top-secret 'torpedo fish,' built in Mobile, Alabama by Horace Hunley from cast iron and wrought iron with a hand-cranked propeller, arrived in Charleston in 1863 while the city was under siege by Union troops and ships. In the ensuing few months, it sank twice after sea trial accidents, killing 13 crew members including Horace Hunley, who was steering. 'There are historical references that the bodies of one crew had to be cut into pieces to remove them from the submarine,' said Mardikian. 'There was forensic evidence when they found the bones (between 1993 and 2004 in a Confederate graveyard beneath a football stadium in Charleston) that that was true.' The Confederate Navy hauled the sub up twice, recovered the bodies of the crew, and planned a winter attack. On the night of February 17, 1864, its captain and seven crew left Sullivan's Island near Charleston, and hand-powered the sub to the Union warship four miles offshore.

A concretion layer covers the hand crank that crew members powered the Civil War submarine H.L. Hunley . From a metal spar on its bow, the Hunley planted a 135-pound torpedo in the hull of the ship, which burned and sank. Before the collision, a lookout on the Housatonic  spotted a bizarre vessel approaching just below the surface— with only its coning tower visible—and sounded the alarm. The Housatonic's cannons couldn't be lowered enough to fire at the strange craft, so crewmen used rifles and pistols, but these were not effective. Some historians say that the submarine showed a mission-accomplished lantern signal from its hatch to troops back on shore before it disappeared. Soon after the signal had been fired, the sub sank about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) off Charleston, where the Hunley remained for 136 years. Mardikian has the lantern, which archaeologists found in the submarine more than a century later, in his laboratory. Scientists removed 10 tons of sediment from the submarine, along with the bones, skulls and even brain matter of the crew members, explained Mardikian. They also found fabric and sailors' personal belongings. Facial reconstructions were made of each member of the third and final crew. They are displayed along with other artifacts in a museum near the submarine. In a nearby vault is a bent gold coin that archaeologists also found in the submarine. It was carried by the sub's captain, Lieutenant George Dixon, for good luck after it stopped a bullet from entering his leg during the Battle of Shiloh in 1862. A concretion layer covers the the Civil War submarine H.L. Hunley. The submarine was found several miles off Charleston, South Carolina in the 1990s and was recovered in 2000 . Conservator Johanna Rivera walks past the bow of the Civil War submarine H.L. Hunley as it stands free of the steel truss that was used to raise it from the ocean floor in 2000 after the truss was removed . 'The submarine was a perfect time capsule of everything inside,' said Ben Rennison, one of three maritime archaeologists on the project. The Hunley Project is a partnership among the South Carolina Hunley Commission, Clemson University Restoration Institute, the Naval Historical Center and the nonprofit Friends of the Hunley. The nonprofit group raised and spent $22 million on the project through 2010, said a spokeswoman. The next phase of the project will be to remove corrosion on the iron hull and reveal the submarine's skin, preserve it with chemicals, and eventually display it in open air, Mardikian said. Scientists have found the vessel to be a more sophisticated feat of engineering than historians had thought, said Michael Drews, director of Clemson's Warren Lasch Conservation Center. 'It has the ballast tanks fore and aft, the dive planes were counterbalanced, the propeller was shrouded,' Drews said. 'It's just got all of the elements that the modern submarines have, updated.' There were previous submarines, Drews said, but the Hunley, designed to sail in the open ocean and built for warfare, was cutting-edge technology at the time. 'Dixon's mission was to attack and sink an enemy ship and he did,' Drews said. 'At that particular time, the mindset of naval warfare was, basically, big ships sink little ships. Little ships do not sink big ships. And the Hunley turned that upside down.'","H.L Hunley was the first submarine ever to sink an enemy warship in combat - in 1864 .

Bonnie: Gail Castle allegedly robbed a Bank of America, and used an old man as her unwitting accomplice . An elderly man who was only trying to sell his car unwittingly became her getaway car driver after the woman taking it on a test drive tried to rob a bank. Gail Castle, 51, had asked if the 83-year-old man, who declined to be identified, would mind her taking the car out for a drive before she bought the 1994 Chrysler 5th Avenue. But after making a pit stop at a Bank of America branch in Sacramento, the man knew something was wrong when he heard sirens behind them. Castle was attempting to buy the man’s decades old car for around $2,200. The man told KTXL that she asked to go for a short drive and needed to stop at the bank before purchasing his vehicle. He drove her to the Bank of America branch in Manteca, California. The bank was quite full, so the man was shocked to see Castle reappear a short time later with dozens of bills in her purse. Thinking nothing of it, the man began driving back to his house to complete the sale. But that’s when he heard sirens. The Manteca Bulletin snapped a picture of the would-be Bonnie Parker as she was arrested by police. Castle allegedly stole more than $2,000 from the bank, KTXL reported. Arrested: Castle, center, was tasered and arrested by police; the 1994 5th Avenue can be seen, left . Sale: The man, who wished not to be identified, was selling his 1994 Chrysler 5th Avenue . According to the Manteca Bulletin, Castle showed the teller a note that read: ‘This is a robbery and I don’t want anybody to get hurt.’ Six police units followed the car, which has only 64,000 miles on the odometer, and ordered the two passengers to get out of the car. The man was handcuffed and taken to a squad car. But Castle wasn’t going to give up without a fight. The Bulletin reports that the petite 51-year-old woman attempted to flee and was shot by a taser.

Colon was found Thursday in the bedroom of her second-floor apartment in Kearny, New Jersey, dead with a gunshot wound to the head. Martinez, 41, was arrested in Pennsylvania on Saturday on an unrelated open warrant, according to NBC.

Tragic loss: 16-year-old Alishia Colon of Kearney, New Jersey was found dead with a gunshot wound in the head Thursday in her own bedroom . He was later charged with Colon's murder, unlawful possession of a firearm and possession of firearm for an unlawful purpose. Bail for Martinez was set at $10,000,000 cash. He is currently being held in a Pennsylvania jail awaiting extradition. Authorities in Kearney say Colon is a hero for having made the lifesaving decision to hide her little brother to protect him from her killer. This according to Colon’s boyfriend’s . father, Ricardo Baez, who according to The Jersey Journal said colon . was babysitting her brother at the time of the slaying. Baez also said he believes his son Joseph Baez, who stood with him during media interviews and at times became overwhelmed by emotion, could easily have been another victim.

Heartbroken: Colon's boyfriend Joseph Baez (pictured) sobbed as he described his beautiful, outgoing girlfriend who was murdered Jan. 17 . Police reported that officers responded to reports of a street fight outside Colon's home earlier that same Thursday. Hudson County Assistant Prosecutor Gene Rubino said that some of Colon's family members were involved in the altercation, but Alishia herself was not. Edwin Mendez, 37, was charged with unlawful possession of a weapon as a result of the earlier incident. Neighbors shocked: Colon was found dead in her Kearney, NJ home on Belgrove Drive, an area usually described as quiet. The weapon in question was, reportedly, a machete.

You may need to step outside though if you want to catch the gossip . The bubble desk idea originated in France by Christian Pottgiesser and has been taken up by two Parisian offices . The thinking behind the bubble desk is that offers the worker privacy while still being connected to a large, communal desk. It is a modern take on partitioned office space popular in the 1980s and which offered privacy but no visibility or sense of connection to colleagues. The trees are designed to compensate for the lack of scenery and are rooted into beds of soil buried out of sight. So far two French companies, Pons and Huot have taken on the office design by Pottgiesser.

"By . Beth Stebner . UPDATED: . 02:02 EST, 30 January 2013 . The father of a Madison Avenue ad executive crushed to death in a horrific elevator accident two years ago is suing the company in charge of the lifts. Alex Hart, whose daughter Suzanne Hart, 41, was killed when an elevator in the Midtown office building rose rapidly as she was stepping into it, accuses the elevator firm of being reckless and ignoring safety rules. The Hart family claims that Transel Elevator and Electric and the negligence of its employees caused Ms Hart’s death. Suing: The father of Suzanne Hart, pictured, is suing the elevator repair company that was in charge of fixing the elevators in her Madison Avenue building . Scene: The lobby of 285 Madison Avenue shortly after Ms Hart was killed in December 2011 . The lawsuit, filed in Brooklyn Criminal Court on Tuesday, cites Transel and its repair crew for numerous errors, including a failing to post repair signs around the elevator and failing to put caution tape inside the elevators. According to DNAInfo.com, the lawsuit also cites the repair crew for operating the elevator at 285 Madison Avenue without a certificate of compliance and not scheduling the city-run Department of Buildings to inspect the lift before it was again operational. Mr Hart’s lawsuit does not state a lump sum of damages required. Ms Hart, who was an executive for advertising firm Y&R, formerly Young & Rubicam, had entered the lobby of the building on December 14 and had stepped into the elevator when it shot up to another floor. Two other people were in the elevator at the time, and witnessed her death. News of Ms Hart’s gruesome end shocked a city reliant on elevators to shoot them from floor to floor in a city dependent on them. A probe by the Department of Buildings in February 2012 revealed that Transel mechanic Michael Hill had disabled a safety switch that would stop an elevator from moving when the doors remained open. The company’s co-owner, John Fichera, had his license suspended for failing to have the city sign off on the lift prior to use again. Family: Ms Hart's father, Alex Hart, far left, pictured with Ms Hart's brother, Mike Hart, and her boyfriend, Chris Dickson . Responding: Emergency personnel gather outside the building where the 41-year-old was killed on the scene, treating only others for trauma . Two-way radios can jam the frequency of an elevator, and there was a history of problematic test results for this particular elevator in the past. Since Ms Hart’s death in 2011, elevator inspections have been more frequent, and city inspectors have doled out harsher fines to code violators, the New York Post said. In an exclusive report, the Post says that inspectors are giving high fines to violators. In addition, there are more inspectors looking at elevators. Mr Hart said it’s welcomed news. ‘I would hate to think that any other family would have to go through what we did,’ he said. Lerch Bates, the safety consultant hired to evaluate the incident, did a test of the faulty elevator car on January 9th- almost a month after the fact- and when a two-way radio was switched on near the elevator's control box, it jolted downwards. Given the similar nature of the elevator's reaction, Mr Hill feels that is a possibility. Lerch Bates also notes that at the time of the accident, the panic motion was not intact on the computer controlling the faulty elevator. Mr Hill said that he is haunted by the death of Ms Hart daily, as he saw her dead body when he responded to the scene. The 25-story building is owned by WPP, the world's biggest advertising group. The tragic death led Department of Buildings inspectors to examine 650 lifts in the city in the largest elevator probe in history. Ms Hart, originally from California, had worked at Y&R ad agency - which represents Campbell's Soup, Land Rover and Xerox - since June 2007. She was in charge of helping to drum up new business and prepare pitches for new clients and was described as a 'crazy hard worker' by colleagues. 'Most people who worked with her would tell you that she was one of the nicest people around,’ one colleague told the New York Daily News.","Suzanne Hart, 41, was killed December 14, 2011 after elevator shot up as she was entering .

John Midgley, said he spotted them from the roadside and on closer inspection realised it was the first time he had seen the species in the ten years he had been holidaying in the area. A mysterious swarm of stingless jellyfish said to look and feel like breast implants have washed up on a New Zealand beach . A doctor holding breast implants that resemble the jellyfish spotted washed up in Nelson, New Zealand . 'There were swarms of them. They're almost clear with a black ring around them,' he told Stuff.co.nz . 'They look like a standard jellyfish but with an odd colour. They've very definitely got a black rim, and there are hundreds in each swarm, he added. The most common species of jelly in New Zealand is the stinging lion's-mane jellyfish (Cyanea species) and the moon jelly (Aurelia species). Nelson's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said swarms of various species are common for this time of year. Dennis Gordon, NIWA principal scientist . and jellyfish expert in Wellington, said that without seeing the . jellyfish himself it was difficult to identify the species but the dark radials extending out from its centre, suggest it could be hydroid medusa. He described them as looking like 'breast implants which had been badly handled'. They grows up to 175mm wide, are saucer-shaped and are fat in the middle and gradually thin out towards the edge. They were last seen in New Zealand in 2010 when the sea's temperature was warmer than average. Andy Horton, editor of British Marine Life said: 'It could be one of thousands of species. 'What's more, they change in appearance throughout their one year life cycle as they grow. 'The tend to come to the end of their lives in autumn, so that is probably why they have been spotted on New Zealand's beaches.'","Stingless jellyfish look and fell like breast implants .

Facing jail: Conman Christopher O'Neill, who set up the Forces for Good company, receiving an award in 2011 . A conman who set up a project to help returning war heroes spent its funds on wining and dining a string of women. Despite having previous convictions for dishonesty, Chris O'Neill, 51, had the ear of politicians as he campaigned to raise awareness of the plight of 'forgotten heroes'. He was handed a £120,000 grant from the Welsh Assembly to refurbish a hotel and six cottages for servicemen to recover. But instead O'Neill, of Colwyn Bay, north Wales,  transferred £74,800 in the bank account of his company Forces For Good Limited to a personal account for his own use. He also withdrew £6,500 to pay costs incurred by him during stays in hotels and . guesthouses and retained £7,000 cash takings from the Jenevoire Hotel at Llandudno and from another project for his own use. O'Neill blew the cash on a lavish spending spree that included buying a speedboat, racking up gambling debts and trying to romance three women at the same time. He also ripped off a dying woman by persuading her to invest £30,000 from a divorce settlement in the hotel and then continued to cash cheques from her account after she died. O’Neill had faced a further charge of making off without paying a hotel bill of £808 in Chester last September. Yesterday, he was warned at Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales that he faced a prison term after he admitted two counts of fraud. He was remanded in custody for a pre-sentence report. Defence counsel Jonathan Austin said there was a 'basis of plea' and O'Neill didn't accept he was dishonest from the outset. Judge Niclas Parry warned O'Neill: 'This is an extremely serious matter involving a substantial fraud on the public purse.' He said he faced a prison term when he returned to court on February 20.

Thousands of home-owners blighted by the high-speed HS2 rail link are set to claim compensation for ‘exceptional hardship’ after a Government quango was today forced to disclose secret information it tried to keep hidden. In a landmark victory for blighted residents, an appeal judge has ordered the HS2 company - set up by ministers to run the controversial £33billion high speed line – to make public details about how far from the track it is allowing ‘exceptional hardship’ compensation claims. The tribunal judge also told bosses at Whitehall firm HS2 Ltd that it was time to ‘treat the public like grown ups’ and credit them with having enough intelligence not to ‘misunderstand’ the requested data. Thousands of home-owners blighted by the high-speed rail link are set to claim compensation for 'exceptional hardship' The judgement came after HS2 Ltd had argued – unsuccessfully - that it needed to keep secret the details because ‘disclosure would lead to a significant rise in the number of applications.’ But the tribunal said people were sensible enough not to misunderstand the significance of ‘a bald distance number’ and that disclosure was ‘in the public interest.’ The judge overturned an earlier decision by the privacy watchdog Information Commissioner which had backed HS2 Ltd’s attempt to keep the details secret. The ruling is now set to open the floodgates to many more ‘exceptional hardship’ applications from people living much further away from the 351-mile track linking London to Birmingham and beyond to Manchester and Leeds. Some have been told by banks that their properties are now worth ‘zero’ because of the blight caused by proximity to the high speed railway. It is a humiliating blow for the firm and was hailed by protesters as a major victory. Campaign groups say the ruling is significant because it gives home-owners an insight into the distance criteria being used secretly by the Government quango when considering ‘exceptional hardship’ compensation claims from people forced to sell because of emergency reasons such as poor health or divorce. An appeal judge has ordered the HS2 company to make publicise details about how far from the track it is allowing compensation claims . Yet despite the judge’s ruling, taxpayer-funded HS2 Limited are still refusing to disclose the farthest distance from the high speed line it had granted exceptional hardship compensation – taking advantage of the 35-day window to decide whether to comply with the disclosure ruling, or to appeal further. Protest groups said the ‘batting average’ for successful claims so far is ‘around 300m’ from the line  but they suspected some so-far undisclosed claims might stretch to up to 0.62 miles – a kilometre – away. The battle for disclosure began when retired homeowner Iain Helstrip from Finmere,  Buckinghamshire applied for ‘exceptional hardship’ compensation for himself and his wife after being unable to sell their rural home. HS2 Limited rejected their claim saying they failed to meet two key criteria, saying that the evidence submitted did not convince them ‘that there was an urgent need to sell now’ and ‘because of the distance of the property from the proposed high speed line.’ Mr Helstrip then asked HS2 how far away from the track the farthest successful claim had been. Opposition: But the line will run through the Chiltern Hills, with villages like Little Missenden set to be on HS2 route to the fury of many . But HS2 Ltd refused to reveal this citing exemption under the Freedom of Information Act stating it would ‘prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs.’ Mr Helstrip then appealed to the Information Commissioner which backed HS2 Ltd’s stance saying that disclosure was ‘likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs and that the public interest favours withholding of the requested information.’ HS2 was therefore ‘not obliged to disclose the information.’ But the appeal tribunal headed by Judge Chris Ryan overturned that decision and backed the residents. The tribunal’s official judgment said: ‘We conclude, unanimously, that HS2 was not justified in refusing the Appellant’s request for information and that it should be disclosed to him.’ It added: ’We have decided that HS2 was not entitled to withhold information about the distance between the route of the proposed line and the property which was furthest away from it, but had nevertheless qualified for assistance under EHS (Exceptional Hardship Scheme).’ And the judge’s ruling adds witheringly: ‘We think that HS2’s expressed fear about the public’s inability to understand the disclosed information does not give the public enough credit for its ability to delve behind over-simplified media headlines or slanted statements from pressure groups.’ The panel said: ‘It does not require information to be withheld from the public as though, in the words of the Appellant’, the public was not sufficiently grown up to be trusted with it.’ Anger: A field in Cubbington in Warwickshire where the HS2 will go through the middle of, sparking large local opposition . The ruling noted that HS2 Ltd did not challenge evidence from Mr Helstrip that local estate agents considered that ‘prices had been significantly reduced across an area extending up to three miles either side of the proposed route.’ HS2 Ltd’s location criterion imposed ‘an unnecessarily strict limitation on qualifying properties.’ The Exceptional Hardship Scheme is discretionary and  open to those  whose properties are ‘significantly adversely affected’ and who live in ‘close proximity’ to it and can prove they are unable to sell because of HS2, and had ‘no prior knowledge’ of the route, as well being able to ‘demonstrate hardship’ defined by strict criteria such as serious medical reasons or divorce. These claims, if successful,  are fast-tracked and paid out much quicker than the normal compulsory purchase claims. It has particular significance for stricken residents like  97-year-old widow Elfrida Harper-Tarr who has been left penniless because of plans for the high-speed rail line through her Buckinghamshire village village of Turweston. The former postmistress had to move into . a nursing home last year and needs to sell her four-bedroom cottage to . pay the care bill. But a local couple who made an offer on the property, . with an asking price of £275,000, were refused a mortgage on it because . the new line is scheduled to pass 500 yards away and said it had a . value of ‘zero.’ Now Mrs Harper-Tarr, who ran a post office from the . property until she was 90 and received an MBE in 1998 for her services . to Scouting in the village, fears she will be unable to afford her . £3,500-a-month care bills. Unsellable: Elfrida Harper-Tarr's former post office in the village of Turweston in Buckinghamshire. The value of the property is 'zero pounds' because of the disruption HS2 will cause . Elfrida Harper-Tarr in the post office in 1998 which she needs to sell to pay for her care bill . HS2 Ltd insists there is no geographical limit for people claiming compensation under the ‘exceptional hardship’ scheme. But protesters at the ‘HS2 Action Alliance’ say HS2 must ‘come clean’. Experts believe up to 350,000 properties have been blighted by the controversial line which will not be completed until 2032, leaving the Government with a total compensation bill of around £2.5billion. HS2 disputes this but is unable or unwilling to provide figures. Hilary Wharf of the HS2 Action Alliance said: ‘This is a great victory for common sense and shines a bright light on Whitehall secrecy over this scheme. Claims made under the ‘exceptional hardship’ rules are extremely difficult because there are so many difficult hoops to jump through. This should inspire more people to claim.’ Mrs Wharf from Amersham in Buckinghamshire, said that original phase 1 ‘exceptional hardship scheme’ had so far  completed just  65  successful claims at a cost of under £20million,  though 83 have been accepted to date. Most are rejected. The ruling comes just days after the Government   launched a consultation on the ‘exceptional hardship rules’ for the second phase of the line from Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester. The judge’s report notes  how Helen German, manager of the EHS scheme argued in her witness statement that:  ‘Disclosure would lead to a significant increase in the number of applications, many of them unmeritorious, because they would arise out a misunderstanding of the relevance of the bald distance figure. This would delay the  process for other applicants.’ Contacted by Mailonline, an HS2 Ltd spokesman said: ‘We note the outcome of the Tribunal’s decision and we will now consider how best to respond. ‘HS2 Ltd’s original decision to withhold the information was intended to uphold the public interest and was supported by the Information Commissioner. The Tribunal agreed that this was a reasonable position for HS2 Ltd to take, but held, on balance,  that it was in the public interest to  disclose the information.’","The tribunal judge said it was time to 'treat the public like grown ups'

Sentenced: Father-of-four Sorient Sigba, 54, was sentenced alongside two associates who ran upmarket Freddy's brothel at Southwark Crown Court . A school teacher who became a pimp was jailed for three years today after police infiltrated his £1million-a-year sex and drug den. Father-of-four Sorient Sigba, 54, was sentenced alongside two associates who ran Freddy's, an upmarket brothel based in a central London mews house. Customers, including bankers and other City workers, were ferried to the three-bedroom den by drivers waiting outside strip clubs. Once there, they were encouraged to take cocaine, costing £60 for a wrap, in order to 'make the sex better'. Clients ran up bills of up to £5,000-a-night, paying £300 for an hour with the venue's women, or £390 if they were paying with card. Sigba, who once worked as a teacher at the Geoffrey Chaucer School in south London, was joined in the dock by Simon Earl, 58, and wine broker Michael Wallen, 50. The court heard how the brothel's operations were 'divided between the three of them', with Sigba responsible for the 'girls and the drivers', Simon dealing with the 'flat and cards' and Wallen looking after the 'figures'. The brothel, which was also run by madam Vera Fosuhene, 46,  turned over £946,776 in just nine months after the property was purchased in 2006. Sigba, known as Freddy, was convicted of conspiracy to control prostitution for gain and conspiracy to transfer criminal property at Southwark Crown Court. The ex-teacher, whose two children are studying law and medicine at university, was described in court as the 'front person at the brothel, engineering and orchestrating the income'. Judge Jeremy McMullen said QC said: 'The operation . itself is considerable. One has only to look at the accounts . meticulously taken night-by-night to see the number of girls supplying . their services and the hours which they worked - 10 to 15 girls a night . each week.' Earl, of Chislehurst, Kent,  was sentenced to two years in jail after pleading guilty, while Wallen, of Hackney, east London, was sentenced to two years and five months in jail after admitting conspiracy to transfer criminal property. Crimes: The central London house in which the trio operated Freddy's brothel, where taxi drivers would bring customers from nearby strip clubs . In a text message to Sigba one . customer wrote: 'I'm in the mood for a total f*** fest. Having two girls . who f*** like rabbits to get me in the mood would be good.' An investigation by the . Metropolitan Police's Human Exploitation and Organised Crime Command, . undercover officers made three visits to the brothel before swooping. Undercover vice cops, named only as . 'John' and 'Alex', visited the property after being . approached by mini-cab drivers outside the City Burlesque club, in . Farringdon. During the first visit in July 2011, after . the door to the brothel was opened by Fosuhene, the officers found five . scantily-clad girls aged between 20 and 25. During a second visit in October 2011 . a Jaguar, later found to be registered to Sigba, was parked outside the . property and Sigba opened the door to the brothel. Guilty: Sigba, who once worked as a teacher at the Geoffrey Chaucer School in south London, was sentenced alongside his associates, including brothel madame Vera Fosuhene, 46, right .

Accused: Michael Brewer was able to keep working with children after a cover-up by Chetham's School of Music, it was alleged in court . A choirmaster caught ‘fondling’ a half-naked schoolgirl was able to keep working with children after a cover-up by a top music school, it was alleged in court yesterday. Michael Brewer, 68, resigned from Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester, claiming he had ‘real feelings’ for the 17-year-old, who was head girl. The official reason given for the father-of-four’s departure was ‘health grounds’. But he went on to serve as musical director of the National Youth Choirs, featured in BBC1’s Last Choir Standing and was awarded the OBE for services to music. Brewer is on trial for raping another ex-pupil with the encouragement of ex-wife Kay. He said the health story was suggested by then headmaster, Rev Peter Hullah, after he had knocked on Brewer’s door in 1994 when the choirmaster had the head girl’s top off. Rev Hullah knocked on the office door when Brewer had the girl’s top off, but while she had time to dress and dash out before he walked in, he became suspicious and ordered an inquiry. Asked if it was ‘a cover-up’ in which ‘everything was swept under the carpet by you, Rev Hullah and Chetham’s’ Brewer said he had acted ‘honourably’. But when pressed by Judge Martin Rudland, the defendant replied: ‘Yes.’ Earlier at Manchester Crown Court, the jury heard from the former head girl that he used to kiss her in his office, take off her top and touch her breasts. Asked if he had wanted the secret relationship to go beyond touching and kissing, Brewer said: ‘We made an agreement, however naïve, just to stick to what teenagers would call the top half.’ He added: ‘I was interested in her as a person – initially as a musician, someone I could talk to, to seek her views.’ The 68-year-old resigned from Chetham's School of Music, in Manchester, claiming he had 'real feelings' for the 17-year-old . Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, pointed out that this would happen with her stripped to the waist, ‘fondling her breasts’. Brewer replied: ‘I hesitate to use the word fondling – I would touch her.’ Mr Cadwallader suggested the same thing happened with the alleged victim, a violinist who stayed at the Brewers in the 1980s. Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies rape and eight counts of indecent assault. Hilary Kay Brewer, 68, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape. The trial continues.

Today they spoke of their love and pride of the 'mischievous but sensitive' young man. Mr Shaw died two days after being shot in Helmand Province on January 14. 'He wanted to be in the army since about year two in school,' recalled Mrs Shaw, 50, from Barrow, Cumbria. 'Whenever they talked about what they wanted to be when they grew up he always said he was going to be a soldier.' Mr Shaw's older sister Michelle, 29, and younger brother Charlie, 21, described their brother as having a 'crazy sense of humour'. His mother added: 'He said to his senior officer during his training, ""I suppose I better call you sir?"". That was our Dave all over.' Mr Shaw joined the army in 2008. His father David, 49, said: 'I was pleased he'd decided he was going to do something, because it gave him some direction in life.' Fulfilling his dreams: Mr Shaw had always wanted to be a soldier, his parents said . Mental strength and determination saw Mr Shaw fulfil his dream of becoming a fully fledged infantryman at the age of 19. 'We were saying last summer how we had seen such a big change in him. I think it made him a man really,' said Mr Shaw. The excitement of his training ended with the call for his first Afghanistan tour in 2010, where he would spend the defining months of his life. 'It was tough,' said his father. 'It was the first time he had been on active duty and it was worrying for all of us. He had never been away for so long.' Mr Shaw's second tour of duty began in October 2012, and his family said he relished the extra responsibility his veteran status afforded him. 'All the younger ones were excited about getting into the action, but he was able to calm them down and tell them what it was really like,' said Mrs Shaw. Despite their suffering, Mr and Mrs Shaw believe their son gave his life to a cause worth fighting for . The news that Mr Shaw had been wounded came on Monday, January 14. 'I was at work, and a man from the MoD came round and told my daughter Sarah he was in theatre in Camp Bastion. It's one of the best hospitals in the world so we were quite hopeful.' Mr and Mrs Shaw were driven to Birmingham by the MoD, but say they had no idea what to expect when they arrived. His younger sister Sarah Shaw, 25, said: 'It didn't even for a second cross my mind that he would die. 'We were more worried about what to say to him when we saw him, rather than fearing the worst.' Her father added: 'We didn't know how bad it was until we got there. We were quite hopeful right up until we were told the prognosis, which wasn't good. 'I did will him to wake up a few times. He just looked like he was asleep,' added Sarah. 'We stroked his hair and squeezed his hand, hoping he would squeeze back. He just had a bandage on his neck, it's hard to look at somebody like that and think ""there's no hope"". That was the hardest thing.' Despite their suffering, Mr and Mrs Shaw believe their son gave his life to a cause worth fighting for. 'Just because they're not doing good right on our doorstep, doesn't mean they're not doing good at all. 'A lot of people say it isn't worth it but the things the army are doing in Afghanistan are fantastic,' said Mr Shaw. 'When I think of what he did over there, and the people he helped after he died, I feel so proud.'","Kingsman Dave Shaw, 23, became 440th British soldier to die in Afghanistan .

An Applebee's waitress has been fired after a bizarre handwritten note from an annoyed customer turned into the latest internet sensation. The waitress in St Louis, Missouri, identified as Chelsea Welch, was shown the door two days after she posted the passive aggressive memo on the popular site Reddit.com. Next to the line indicating that an 18 per cent tip had been automatically added to the bill, the customer, a local pastor, crossed out the tip total, replaced it with a 'zero' and wrote: 'I give God 10 percent, why do you get 18?' Scroll down for video . Ill will: Applebee's waitress Chelsea Welch was shown the door two days after she posted Pastor Alois Bell's passive aggressive memo on Reddit . She then signed the bill 'Pastor Alois Bell.' Befuddled, Ms Welch posted a photo of the bill on Reddit with the headline: 'My mistake sir, I'm sure Jesus will pay for my rent and groceries.' Ms Welch said she was not the waitress who received the note, and posted it on behalf of a fellow Applebee's worker. But as the posting took on a life of its own on the internet this week, Ms Welch was fired. She said that she's a dedicated employee and was shocked to hear the news. Ms Welch told The Consumerist: 'When I posted this, I didn’t represent Applebee's in a bad light. In fact, I didn’t represent them at all. I did my best to protect the identity of all parties involved. I didn't break any specific guidelines in the company handbook - I checked. Speaking out: Pastor Alois Bell says the note was a 'lapse in judgment' She went on: 'But because this person got embarrassed that their selfishness was made public, Applebee’s has made it clear that they would rather lose a dedicated employee than lose an angry customer. That's a policy I can't understand.' In a statement to The Smoking Gun, Applebee's spokesman Dan Smith said: 'Our franchisee has apologized to the guest,' and that the employee who posted the bill to Reddit 'is no longer employed by the franchise.' Speaking to KTVI-TV on Thursday, the pastor said she should have thought better of the message she wrote. Ms Bell, who preaches at the Truth in the Word Deliverance Ministries, told the station: That was a lapse in my judgment. I should've have did that. I apologize for that. I'm human. I did that.' She also said that despite reports, she didn’t stiff the waitress. In fact, she left two tips - the 18 percent automatic tip and an additional $6 she left on the table.

The husband of one of the cruel lesbians who tortured a 67-year-old pensioner to death has described how his former wife became a violent drug addict. Karl Siirak, the ex-husband of Kelly Barnes who was convicted of murdering Barry Reeve with her lesbian lover Jodie Barnes, says he watched his wife become cruel and desperate to feed her addiction for drugs. Mr Siirak says he is sickened by the pair's brutality after they punched, stamped and slashed Mr Reeve with a knife, leaving the helpless pensioner dying for up to 48 hours. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Jodie Barnes (left) and Kelly Barnes (right) have been convicted of murder after torturing and killing a pensioner . The heartless couple, from Norwich, even . returned to his home after visiting the bank machine, stealing . valuables and emptying his freezer. Kelly, 32, and Jodie, 31, who had both . denied murder have been given life imprisonment, with an order to each . serve a minimum term of 24 years. Barry Reeve lay dying for up to 48 hours after the attack . Mr Siirak, from Barry, South Wales, told The Mirror how he met Kelly in 1997, when she moved into the property beneath him. He described how they fell in love, married in 1999 and had four children together, saying their lives were the picture of domestic bliss . But their happiness soured when the . security guard noticed his wife suffered extreme mood swings, and became . a vicious, volatile woman. He told The Mirror: 'She was no longer . the woman I'd wed and had become this paranoid, violent person who'd . lash out at any moment.' The pair divorced in 2005 with Kelly . having custody over the children, and Mr Siirak said he heard rumours . that Kelly was in sexual relationships with men and women. He said she began experimenting with drugs and met Jodie, who she wed in a civil partnership ceremony in 2010. Mr Siirak claims that Kelly became . 'horrendous' as she and Jodie clung together in a volatile relationship, . both addicted to drugs. He claims that at one point they were so poor the pair lived in a tent with the four children for two months. He said: 'After they'd sold everything . in the house for drugs, they started selling the children's toys – . that’s how low they stooped.' Kelly Barnes (left) and Jodie Barnes 'took away just about anything of value that Mr Reeve had' The father claims he was powerless to . intervene because Jodie dominated Kelly, so if he interfered he would . not have access to his children. Victim Barry Reeve told the pair he didn't have any money . When he heard about the murder case, he said he was devastated and offered his condolances to Mr Reeve's mourning family. He said: 'I can't get my head around how . that sweet 17-year-old girl I met all that time ago could get involved . in something so evil.' The pair were caught on CCTV pictures . trying to withdraw their victim's life-savings from a cash machine, . attempting on several occasions to enter Mr Reeve's pin number. The . court heard how the couple even returned to his home after visiting the . bank machine, stealing valuables and emptying his freezer. Members of Mr Reeve's family wept as the verdict was delivered at Norwich Crown Court on Thursday. A statement released by Mr Reeve's children said they 'could not be happier with the verdict'. It added: 'As a family we were deeply shocked and distressed by what happened and . the consequences for both of us, his son and daughter and his . grandchildren. 'Our family could not be happier with the verdict, however, no amount of . time these women spend in prison will change what happened and bring . back our lovely little dad. 'The whole court process has been a very emotional time, however, we . look upon this as closure and now need to concentrate on our grieving . and learning to live our lives without Dad whilst trying to come to . terms with the awful circumstances in which he was taken from us.' Callous: The pair were convicted of murdering the retired bus conductor. After visiting the cash machine they returned to his home and stole valuables . Jodie Barnes, formerly Ramsbottom, who . claimed during the trial that 'God had forgiven her', clutched a Bible . and looked stunned. Kelly Barnes shook her head and looked towards her partner. As sentence was passed, Jodie Barnes shouted: 'I didn't lie, I swore on the Bible.' Jailing them for life, Judge Peter Jacobs said: 'The man who you killed was frail, old and vulnerable and lived on his own. 'It . was a grotesque situation that he was lying there slowly dying and you . were going around his property, stepping over and around his body and . stealing his property. 'Survival was impossible, death was inevitable. 'You took away just about anything of value that he had.' Norfolk Police found a bag that contained Barry Reeve's wallet. The pair who killed him returned to the scene to collect food they had taken from his freezer . Mr . Jacobs added that after their arrests the couple were still 'an item' and only began to blame one another when the weight of evidence against . them became clear. He said Mr Reeve's 'mental and . physical suffering' aggravated the crime and added: 'You were totally . indifferent as to whether he lived or died.' During the trial mother-of-four Kelly . admitted that they both visited Mr Reeve on February 9 last year after . Jodie suggested that he might lend them or give them cash. But . she told a jury that she had nothing to do with harming him and she . claimed she did not see Jodie assaulting him at his home in Norwich, . Norfolk. Kelly claimed that . Jodie only confessed to her what she had done to Mr Reeve when they met . up in the gym at a women’s prison in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Police recovered retired bus conductor Barry Reeve's wallet, after the pensioner was found in his home . Evidence: Mr Reeve's blood was found on a pair of jogging bottoms worn by Jodie . Kelly . told the jury that Jodie had told her before they visited Mr Reeve that . she had got to know the pensioner through her sister and he had . previously given her money. She . admitted she was ‘staggering and light-headed’ when they went to his . bungalow as she had taken drugs including heroin and had been drinking.

The pensioner's body was found in his blood splattered home two weeks later after he had died of serious head injuries. He had also developed pneumonia.

The Republican President was treated in the local Methodist Hospital for two months because of a bronchitis-related cough and other health issues. The health troubles appeared to be well out of sight over the weekend, however, as happy diners spotted the former President and took a picture alongside him. Three's a crowd: Former President George H.W. Bush was spotted in a Houston restaurant- a little over two weeks after he was released from hospital- by two fans who took a picture with the Republican leader . The 88-year-old looks a bit startled but happy in the photo, which was then posted onto local news anchor Janet Shamlian's Instagram and Twitter accounts. Mr Bush, who is the oldest-living President, initially went into the hospital on November 23, and was upgraded to intensive care one month later because his condition worsened. Physicians said that they were having difficulty controlling a fever that developed after the cough improved. His office said on December 29 that he . had been moved back to a regular hospital room. Since then, his . condition has continued to improve and he has been undergoing physical . therapy to rebuild his strength. He suffers from a form of Parkinson's . disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter . or wheelchair to get around. Former President George HW Bush was released from hospital today after a two-month stay. He spends winters in Texas and watched the Houston Texans play the Buffalo Bills on November 4 2012 .

A man dubbed 'El Wingador' for his ability to eat a chicken wing in a split-second was indicted on charges of dealing cocaine yesterday. As a five-time champion of Philadelphia's competitive chicken wing eating race - the Wing Bowl - William Simmons has became a legend in his South Jersey community and the gluttonous world of eating contests. However, the married star is now facing altogether different notoriety after being formerly charged by a Gloucester County grand jury of possession and distribution of cocaine on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Chicken? El Wingador, pictured, has won Philadelphia's Wing Bowl contest five times eating more than 150 wings in half an hour. He is currently facing drugs charges and is barred from taking part in the contest . Local legend: William Simmons or El Wingador, pictured, is a local hero for his domination of Philadelphia's annual chicken wing eating contest. However, he has now been indicted on cocaine charges . The father-of-three, of Woodbury Heights, who last won the contest by eating 162 wings in 32 minutes, was indicted by a jury on 13 separate drug counts, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. The decision came on the eve of his beloved contest which marks the Friday before the Super Bowl and took place today. El Wingador was barred from entry. He was first arrested in connection to the charges in June 2012 and after 10 days in jail was released on $100,000 bail. Following his arrest the 51-year-old apologized to his fans for being 'a big dummy'. 'I know I'm not a bad person,' Simmons said, 'just a big dummy, and I'm asking not to be judged by this one thing.' Following his time in jail he also released a statement condemning 'hard-time' for non-violent offenders. A wing and a prayer: William Simmons, left in his police photo, has been indicted on 13 drug offenses. He drew crowds for his record-breaking buffalo wing consumption which won him the name El Wingador . Facing jail: El Wingador, pictured, could face a jail term for the drugs charges he . faces. Today he aired his frustration at not being able to take part in . Wing Bowl 2013 and promised to come back out of retirement . 'I got to see first hand the impact hard time for nonviolent offenders has on these young kids facing long sentences, giving them no chance at rehabilitation or of ever leading normal, productive lives,' he said. Simmons is charged with four counts of possession of a controlled dangerous substance and one count of manufacturing or distribution of more than a half ounce of cocaine. He is also charged with six counts of manufacturing or distribution of more than a half ounce and less than five ounces of the drug and two counts of manufacturing less than half an ounce. The Wing Bowl was held for the 21st time at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia this morning with a prize of $20,000 for the fastest eater. Founder Angelo Cataldi said Simmons would not be allowed to take part in this year's events. 'We all owe a debt to Bill for what he has done for our event,' Cataldi told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'But I think for his benefit that his role be downplayed while he's working things out with the courts.' He apparently missed the 'biggest moment' in Wing Bowl's history, according to Cataldi, as New Eagles coach Chip Kelly dropped in to watch the competition. Cooped up: William Simmons, left, aired his frustrations at not being able to take part in the Wing Bowl wing eating contest today. He is facing a court case after being indicted on cocaine charges . El Wingador retired after become top of the pecking order in the 1999, 2001- 2003 and 2005 Wing Bowl contests. He came back in 2011 but was beaten by a single wing consumed by Jonathan “Super” Squibb who managed to eat 255 wings across the 30 minute contest - worth around 25,000 calories. In 2012 Simmons came third and was arrested six months later. This year the contest was won by James 'The Bear' Macdonald in his second ever chicken wing eating contest. He beat Squibb by five wings consuming a whopping 287 wings in half an hour. According to the Inquirer the former champ aired his frustrations on Facebook today, even suggesting another return from retirement. 'As I sit here listening to Wing Bowl ... and I;m not having a very good . day ... I can't help knowing that I still CAN COMPETE in Wing Bowl. Dealing with some crazy stuff in my life right now, but going to stay . strong. Keep it in Philly! I have to say if . New England wins, that will suck! It will make me think about coming out . of retirement to try to bring it back, if I'm able ... My wife will . kill me ... lol,' he reportedly wrote. El Wingador has previously thanked his fans for their support through his legal issues. 'People showed an awful lot of support for someone who’s just a chicken-wing guy,' he said.","Champion chicken wing eater, who can consume 162 hot wings in half an hour, was indicted in Philadelphia yesterday on drug charges .

When four of the San Francisco 49ers starred in an anti-bullying video for the 'It Gets Better Project' last year, they were praised for being the first in the sport to take a public stand against homophobia. But two of the players have now said they never appeared in the video - and when they were shown the footage, they claimed they did not realise it was in support of LGBT teenagers. The bizarre responses from linebacker Ahmad Brooks and nose tackle Isaac Sopoaga come days after teammate Chris Culliver said gay people were not welcome on the team during a radio interview. In response to the strange denials, the It Gets Better Project has now removed the clip from its website, its co-founder Dan Savage announced. Denial: 49ers linebacker Ahmad Brooks claimed he did not know a video he filmed for the It Gets Better Project was to support LGBT teens. He is pictured in the video, which came out in August . Strange: Nose tackle Isaac Sopoaga also did not know what the video was for when he was asked about it . The one-minute video features Brooks, Sopoaga, safety Donte Whitner and nose tackle Ricky Jean Francois. Whitner is the only player in the clip to make a direct reference to the gay community. 'The San Francisco 49ers are proud to join itgetsbetter.org to let all . LGBT teens know that it gets better,' said Whitner. On . behalf of the entire 49ers organization, we are on your side. And we . promise: It gets better.' When USA TODAY Sports approached Brooks and Sopoaga, they denied being part of the video. 'I didn't make any video,' Brooks . said. 'This is America and if someone wants to be gay, they can be gay. It's their right. But I didn't make any video.' When the reporter said he did, Brooks added: 'I don't remember that. I think if I made a video, I'd remember it.' Role model: Linebacker Ahmad Brooks is pictured against the Seattle Seahawks in October last year . Vehement: Sopoaga, pictured, at first claimed that his name was being used mistakenly on the video . After he was shown the video, he said: 'Oh, that. It was an anti-bullying video, not a gay (rights) video.' When the reporter told Brooks that many bullied teens are picked on for their sexuality, he said: 'I know that. I know that. Okay, you're right and I'm wrong. Are you from one of those New York newspapers?' Sopoaga also denied making the video, insisting: 'I never went. And now someone is using my name.' When he was shown the video, he asked what it was for. The 49ers were encouraged to take part in the campaign by Sean Chapin, a lifelong 49ers fan who launched a petition on Change.org . that received more than 16,000 signatures. Annoyed: Dan Savage, co-founder of the It Gets Better Project, tweeted the video has been taken down . Campaign: The project was set up in response to a series of suicides of gay teens who had been bullied . 'With their ""It Gets Better"" video, the 49ers are shining a golden . beacon of hope to LGBT youth, and as a gay man, I enthusiastically . applaud their courage and leadership,' Chapin said in August. Scott Zumwalt of the 'It Gets Better Project' added: 'Many (49ers) wanted to be in it, but they picked the most intimidating guys to deliver the message.' But on Thursday, co-founder Dan Savage announced on Twitter than the video would be taken down in light of the players' attempts to distance themselves from it. 'We've removed the #49ers #ItGetsBetter video from our website #homophobia #NFL #horses***' he wrote. It comes as yet more embarrassment . for the Super Bowl-bound team after Culliver, made startling remarks . during a radio interview this week with comedian and radio host Artie . Lange. Offensive: Earlier this week, 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver made anti-gay remarks to a radio host . On the radio: Culliver made the comments in an interview with radio host and comedian Artie Lange . Lange asked the 24-year-old: 'Do any gay guys approach you?' Without so much as a pause to even think about the question, Culliver shot back: 'I don't do the gay guys man. I don't do that.' When . asked if he believed there were any gay players on the 49ers roster, . Culliver responded: 'No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they . gotta get up out of here if they do. He added: 'Can't be with that sweet stuff... Can't be... in the locker room man. Nah.' 'OK, so they'd have to keep it a secret?' Lange asks. Culliver responds: 'Yeah, you gotta come out 10 years later after [retirement].' Secretive: Last year, former 49er Kwame Harris was arrested for allegedly assaulting a former boyfriend in Menlo Park, California. Until then, Harris was extremely secretive about his sexual orientation . The comments were immediately met with outrage from gay rights groups, 49ers fans and Culliver's bosses and teammates. Later on Wednesday, the player backtracked, issuing a nonsensical statement of apology, blaming his behavior on the thoughts in his head. 'The derogatory comments I made yesterday were a reflection of thoughts in my head, but they are not how I feel,' he said. 'It has taken me seeing them in print to realize that they are hurtful and ugly. Those discriminating feelings are truly not in my heart. Further, I apologize to those who I have hurt and offended, and I pledge to learn and grow from this experience.'","Ahmad Brooks and Isaac Sopoaga denied taking part in the campaign .

An Indiana couple facing jail time for nursing an injured fawn back to health rather than leaving it to die could be granted a reprieve. The Department of Natural Resources has said that it will ask that charges be dismissed against Jeff and Jennifer Counceller, who were charged with the illegal possession of a deer. The couple were each charged and faced 60 days in jail and a $500 fine after they rescued the wounded fawn they named Little Orphan Dani and kept it for two years on their 17-acre farm. Connersville police officer Jeff Counceller says he discovered the tiny deer curled up on a neighbor’s front porch, badly wounded and unable to stand, while he was on patrol two years ago. Reprieve: Jeff and Jennifer Counceller face jail for taking in a wounded deer - but the charges could be dropped . Punishing: An Indiana couple are facing criminal charges after they nursed this fawn back to health after finding it badly wounded near their home . Without time to help it himself, he called his wife, a registered nurse, who cautiously approached the deer with their teenager daughter before the fawn gently licked their hands. Unbeknownst to them at the time, however, was that bringing the animal home with them was illegal according to the state's Department of Natural Resources, with the crime punishable by jail. But news of the charges prompted a massive outpouring of online support for the couple, and an online petition demanding the charged be dropped received more than 30,000 signatures. 'I had hopes that it would come out this way because it was obvious that much of the world saw the compassion of what we did and there was not criminal intent,' Jennifer Counceller told the IndyStar. Gov. Mike Pence asked the agency to reevaluate the case, and investigators asked the prosecutor to dismiss the charges. The Decatur County Prosecuting Attorney's office said it was waiting a statement from the DNR about where it stands on the case before going forward. Good intentions: Jeff and Jennifer Counceller, pictured, brought the deer home, naming it Little Orphan Dani, in hopes of one day releasing it back into the wild . Repercussions: The couple are accused of illegally possessing a white-tailed deer, a misdemeanor offense punishable with up to 60 days in jail and a fine up to $500 . When Mrs Councellor first saw the deer in 2010, she described it as having puncture wounds along its hips from a possible coyote attack. The wounds she said were maggot infested. If they left the animal there it would surely die, she reasoned. They called the DNR, who told them to take the animal out into the woods and leave it there. 'She would have laid there and starved to death and had a miserable death,' Mrs Connersville told the IndyStar. Instead they took the animal back to . their 17-acre farm and began caring for her, starting with a small . bottle of goats milk, while giving her the name of Little Orphan Dani. The . Councellers said the charges came after a six-month investigation by . the department which included a half a dozen visits to their home and . calls to local authorities. The family says they didn’t know at . the time that it was illegal to keep the deer. The DNR offered to . euthanize the deer, who was said to be posing a safety threat to humans. Human threat: The Indiana Department of Natural Resources told them, Jeff Counceller pictured, that they have to euthanize the deer with it now being a potential threat to human health . ‘I . was devastated,’ Mrs Counceller told ABC of her reaction. ‘I spent a . year and several months nursing her into adulthood, getting to the point . where she was able to go out on her own. No matter what the law is, we did what was right for the animal.' But on the day of Dani's scheduled execution they found the deer gone. The door to her outdoor enclosure was found hanging open. An incident report filed by the DNR lists Jennifer Counceller’s 80-year-old father as a suspect in the animal’s release, but that’s an allegation Mrs Counceller says they cannot prove. The family says they didn't have a hand in Dani's escape but admit that they also didn't try too hard to find out how it happened. Mr Counceller only reasons that Dani had a good number of friends: 'She was very popular.'","Jeff and Jennifer Counceller accused of illegally harboring the fawn .

The boy, named Vladimir, is 5½ years old, struggles at learning to count and draw, and lives in an orphanage in Kyrgyzstan. His would-be parents in New York have had just five brief visits since they signed on to adopt him in 2008, yet they refuse to abandon the quest. 'We have already bonded with this child,' said Frances Pardus-Abbadessa. 'Probably a day doesn't go by that we don't think of him. In our mind, he's our child. If we don't wait for him, what's his fate going to be?' Still hopeful: Drew and Frances Pardus-Abbadessa (pictured) of New York are still trying to adopt the boy from Kyrgyzstan they named Franco Michael, despite five years of bureaucratic shuffling . Frances and her husband, Drew, were among a group initially known as the 'Kyrgyz 65' — Americans who were in the process of adopting 65 orphans from the Central Asian republic when it suspended international adoptions in 2008 due to allegations of fraud. The group's ranks have dwindled over the ensuing years while Kyrgyzstan's adoption system has been disrupted by political turmoil and persisting corruption problems. A little brother: The Pardus-Abbadessas adopted Pavol, 1, and hope he'll soon meet his adopted big brother from Kyrgyzstan, where 65 adoptions to American families were abruptly halted in 2008 . Some of the Americans gave up, some of the children were placed in domestic adoptions, and last summer nine of the remaining children finally were allowed to go to America. The Pardus-Abbadessas are now among 16 U.S. families still waiting, five years later. Drew describes their predicament as 'an emotional roller-coaster.' But he and others in the waiting group are cautiously encouraged by the efforts of Kyrgyzstan's new social development minister, Edil Baisalov. A 35-year-old English-speaker and avid Twitter user, Baisalov has brought an uncharacteristic level of openness to government business in his post-Soviet nation during six months on the job. He is working on new anti-corruption regulations and hopes for swift government approval that might help clear the way for the remaining U.S. adoption cases to be completed. It's not a sure thing. Various anti-corruption and children's rights activists in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, have criticized the proposed rules as inadequate and vowed to oppose them. But one of the waiting Americans, Shannon Fenske of Reeseville, Wis., said Baisalov nonetheless had raised hopes after so many disappointments. Incomplete: Keven and Shannon Fenske of Reeseville, Wis. have adopted children from Ethiopia, New Orleans, and Kyrgyzstan. They hoped to adopt another child from Kyrgyzstan in 2008 but, as with the Pardus-Abbadessas, their adoption was stopped . 'We are so incredibly impressed and grateful for what he has done since taking over,' Fenske said. 'He's been the most vocal in favor of moving our cases forward.' Fenske, a medical technician, and her husband, Kevin, an aircraft maintenance manager, were matched in July 2008 with an infant Kyrgyz girl afflicted by a severe cleft lip and palate. They arranged for two operations for Kamila that improved her condition, but pain and speech problems linger. Family bonds: Drew Pardus-Abbadessa has met Vladimir, the Kyrgyz boy he calls Franco Michael, only five times but says he and his wife feel a deep bond with the child and remain committed to adopting him . The Fenskes have four other adopted children with special needs, including a 6-year-old boy adopted from Kyrgyzstan in 2007. But even with a bustling household, there's no thought about dropping the quest to adopt Kamila, whom they've visited only once — last June. 'She's our daughter — it's that simple,' Shannon Fenske said. 'We promised her a family. We will not stop fighting for her until she's here, where we feel she belongs.' Kyrgyzstan is an economically struggling country with often ill-equipped orphanages. Resources are scarce, specialist training to care for severely disabled children is limited, and the daily food budget at some facilities is $1.50 per child. Unscrupulous bureaucrats dealing in what was effectively a trade in children led to two halts in foreign adoptions — in 2006 and 2008 — by Kyrgyz authorities. Last July, adoptions were again frozen after the arrest of Baisalov's predecessor, Ravshan Sabirov, for allegedly extorting funds from foreign adoption agencies seeking accreditation. Sabirov eventually was acquitted, but nonetheless lost his post. Under the new rules being pushed by Baisalov, any adoption agency working in Kyrgyzstan will have to secure separate agreements with four government ministries and with the security service, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB. Foreign agencies will be required to provide detailed financial statements to reduce the odds of corruption. Despite that, the Bishkek-based Protection of Children's Rights League remains unconvinced and insists that many problems still need resolving. The league's leader, Nazgul Turdubekova, says corrupt local officials and unscrupulous intermediaries are commonly seen at international adoption agencies' offices. Holding out hope: Orphanages in Kyrgyzstan are notoriously underfunded and understaffed and the adoption system in the country remains mired with uncertainty while families in the U.S. want desperately to open their homes to the orphans . Baisalov described criticism of proposed adoption rules as 'absolutely irrational.' 'They are just using children for their own public relations aims,' he said. 'They are criticizing provisions they developed themselves and are thus delaying the reunification of Kyrgyz children with their parents.' Drew and Frances Pardus-Abbadessa fervently hope for such a reunion with Vladimir, who they already consider their son. They're hoping to rename him Franco Michael, after the first names of their parents. Joyous reunion: Ann Bates holds Krystina, one of the nine children from the original 'Kyrgyz 6' who were allowed to be sent to their American families when adoptions briefly resumed last summer . The couple is wary of sharing photos that show his face, for fear of breaching adoption protocol. But they readily recall their five visits with him, dating back to June 2008, when he was 7 months old and they found him at his orphanage in a large pen filled with crying children. Their last meeting was in July 2012. Since then, said Drew Pardus-Abbadessa, they've been sending letters and packages but have been told not to visit. 'You're introduced to a child, and they become part of your heart, part of your family,' Drew said. 'Then there are the delays, all the ups and downs. You have your hopes raised and they're dashed again.' Drew, an environmental engineering consultant, and Frances, who works for New York City's Office of Child Support Enforcement, completed a domestic adoption while waiting for a resolution in Kyrgyzstan. They're intent that son Pavol, who turns 2 on Feb. 22, will have an older brother. Still waiting: Kevin Fenske (center) adopted his son Esen (left) from Kyrgyzstan in 2007 and took him to visit Kamilia (right), who they hope to one day bring home from the central Asian country . 'It's not what we signed up for — adopting a child that old,' Frances said of Vladimir. 'It will be harder for us. He will have bonding issues. But at least he'll have love and support, a chance he'll never have if he stays in that orphanage.' The Pardus-Abbadessas, the Fenskes and the other waiting families have an ardent well-wisher in the person of Ann Bates, a 41-year-old pediatric transport nurse from Bernville, Pa., who was one of the nine members of the Kyrgyz 65 able to complete her adoption last summer. Bates — a single mother now engaged to a long-time friend — says her 6-year-old daughter, Krystina, is developmentally delayed compared to other children her age, but is physically healthy and a joy to have around the house. Bates also adopted a boy from Russia in 2010, and considers herself lucky, given that Russia in December banned further adoptions by Americans in retaliation for a U.S. law targeting alleged Russian human-rights violators. Bates remains in touch with the families still waiting for Kyrgyz adoptions and yearns for their success. 'My heart still bleeds for all of those kids,' she said. 'I've seen them, I've held them, I've helped advocate for the last five years. 'I see the huge improvements that Krystina has made in six months that she would never have made in an institution,' Bates added. 'To know the others are not getting that attention is heartbreaking.'","Corruption plagues the adoption system in the Central Asian republic, which halted adoptions in 2008 .

A six-year-old who suffers from severe cerebral palsy has had her dream of walking again shattered after callous thieves stole her disability car, wheelchair and specially-designed walking frame. Little Tyla Anguige had been making excellent progress but the heartbreaking burglary has meant the chances of pioneering surgery to help her walk again have been hit. Raiders drove off in the youngster's disability car which contained the tiny wheelchair and her made-to-measure frame, essential for her physiotherapy, in the early hours of Wednesday. 'Heartless': Tyla Anguige, 6, who suffers from severe cerebral palsy, has had her wheelchair and specially-designed walking frame (right) stolen . The inspector leading the case says it is likely the 'heartless' thieves knew exactly what had been taken and has appealed for help to track them down. Tyla's devastated mother Chrissy Jackson, 25, said: 'She needs the frame for physiotherapy and we can't just replace it because it was a one-off specially made-to-measure walking frame for her. 'Without the physiotherapy an operation to help her walk isn't going to work. 'Tyla has spastic diplegia, which means the muscles in her legs are really stiff. She can't stand up and moves by crawling. Appeal: The inspector leading the case says the thieves would have known exactly what had been taken including Tyla's wheelchair (pictured) and has appealed for help to track them down . 'The wheelchair is invaluable and she uses the frame as part of her exercise regime which she has to do every day to build her strength up.' Chrissy, who lives with partner Darren Anguige, Tyla and son Jensen, four, in Bradford, West Yorkshire, said Tyla is due to undergo spinal surgery at Leeds General Infirmary next week, aimed at releasing elasticity in her muscles. Irreplaceable: Tyla's mother Chrissy Jackson (pictured together) said her little girl needs the one-off specially made frame for physiotherapy . She said: 'All children who have had the operation have been walking within a year but the walking frame is crucial for the physiotherapy.' The raid at the family home was discovered by a neighbour at 5.30am on Wednesday. The living room had been ransacked with a TV, laptop, iPad and iPods stolen. But the biggest blow was the theft of the family's white BMW 1 series convertible from the drive. Chrissy said: 'The wheelchair and walking frame were in the boot. 'They are irreplaceable and this couldn't have come at a worse time. 'I'm not bothered about anything else, I just want Tyla's equipment back. 'If anyone knows where they are I would ask them to search their consciences and think of my little girl.' Det Insp George Bardell, of Bradford South CID, said: 'It is particularly galling that those responsible will have likely known that this was specialised equipment used to assist someone's mobility. 'It is clearly not easy to replace such items which are heavily relied upon by the user for their daily routine. 'These heartless actions will undoubtedly have caused significant upset and difficulties and it is important we apprehend those behind this.'","Tyla Anguige needs her wheelchair and walking frame for physiotherapy .

NBC News President Steve Capus, who presided over years of strong ratings at the news division and expanded digital offerings but was hurt by the downfall of the 'Today' show, said on Friday that he was resigning. The Philadelphia-area native joined NBC News 20 years ago and produced various newscasts for Brian Williams before being appointed news division president by Jeff Zucker, at the time chief of NBC Universal, on the week that Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005. NBC parent company Comcast Corp.'s decision last year to appoint Pat Fili-Krushel to a supervisory role over the company's news properties signaled to many that Capus' tenure was nearing an end. His contract gave Capus an opt-out provision and he chose to exercise it. Capus said in an email to staff members that 'it is now time to head in a new direction,' although he hasn't said what that might be. 'It is impossible to fully express how much I respect the people of NBC News,' he wrote. 'To call everyone 'colleagues' has been a true honor ... but to call so many of you dear friends has been a true gift. Thank you for everything. I could not be prouder of what we have accomplished together.' He added: 'I have seldom described my role as presiding over NBC News... Instead, I have viewed it as leading a collaborative effort to pursue journalistic excellence.' A primary yardstick for network news' success is the ratings for the flagship evening news program, and NBC's broadcast with Williams has held on to the top spot. Capus has expanded NBC's reach with specialty websites aimed at black and Latino audiences, and reached a deal to take over all responsibility for the main NBC news site, buying out Microsoft's stake. Capus also oversaw the MSNBC news division. MSNBC has become profitable through its decision to skew liberal in its commentary. Troubled year: President of NBC News Steve Capus, left, with NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams, has had a tough year with the 'Today' show . Tim Russert's sudden death forced Capus to revamp the Sunday morning political talk show 'Meet the Press,' where David Gregory has run hot and cold since taking over. The profitable 'Today' show has taken a hard fall in the past year and now runs a consistent second to ABC's 'Good Morning America.' NBC was widely criticized for mismanagement of Ann Curry's dismissal as 'Today' anchor last summer. Jim Bell, the show's executive producer, stepped down last fall. Fili-Krushel set out a new temporary management structure, increasing the authority of executives Alex Wallace and Antoine Sanfuentes, until she names a successor. 'NBC News is America's leading source of television news and Steve has been a big part of that success,' Fili-Krushel said in a memo to staff members.","Steve Capus announced his resignation on Friday .

A 'despicable' burglar posed as a police officer to trick his way into the house of a man dying of cancer before stealing presents bought for a family friend. Robert Kolwicz, 63, had just returned home from the Bristol Royal Infirmary when Ross Madden knocked on his door and said he needed to search the flat. Madden, 21, claimed to be a police officer investigating money laundering. He proceeded to look around both bedrooms before saying he couldn't find anything. Callous: Robert Kolwicz had just got home from Bristol Royal Infirmary, pictured, when the thief turned up . An hour after his visitor had gone, Mr Kolwicz, a retired lorry driver, realised a laptop and an iPod had been stolen from his spare room. The items were Christmas gifts that the grandfather of three ad been planning to give to a close family friend who often visited him. After the raid on December 14, his health and state of mind deteriorated and he had to spend what is likely to be his last Christmas Day - also his birthday - back in the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Mr Kolwicz's son Nathan said: 'A crime is a crime, but for someone to do something like this - I wouldn't wish it on anybody. To target a vulnerable pensioner with cancer is terrible. 'Dad had not long come home from hospital when it happened. The burglary really knocked him back. 'He lasted about ten days before he was back at the BRI and after that he didn't want to go back home. He's now in a care home.' The 31-year-old, from Chipping Sodbury, Glocs, said: 'The burglary made him a nervous wreck and he was ringing me at three or four in the morning, worried.' Jailed: Madden, who was known to police, was sentenced to two years and 146 days at Bristol Crown Court . Mr Kolwicz could not afford to replace the Christmas presents stolen by Madden, of Bristol. Madden was identified from a fingerprint that scenes of crimes experts recovered from Mr Kolwicz's front door. The confidence trickster, who was known to the police and had previous convictions for raiding homes, was arrested on December 19 and charged with burglary. In police interview, Madden claimed he had been with a friend who had apparently wanted to go to his grandfather's flat. He claimed it was his friend who searched Mr Kolwicz's rooms before handing him a bag containing a computer. However, by the time the case came to Bristol Crown Court, with no evidence that anyone else had been with Madden that day, he admitted the charge and was sentenced to two years and 146 days in prison by Judge Julian Lambert. DC Kai Hannan, of Avon and Somerset police's Doorstep Crime Team, said: 'This really was a despicable crime. Ross Madden targeted and preyed on an elderly and vulnerable man. 'The notion that someone would not know that Mr Kolwicz was ill, given his current condition, is simply not true.'","Grandfather Robert Kolwicz, 63, had only just got back from hospital .

The number of people detained under the Mental Health Act is on the rise (posed by model) One in every 25 mentally ill patients who have been sectioned have 'irregularities' in their records which could mean they are being unlawfully detained, the health watchdog has warned. Of 4,500 patient records checked by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) between 2011 and 2012, 4 per cent contained mistakes which called the legality of their detention into question. The number of people detained under the Mental Health Act is on the rise. People with mental disorders can be detained to ensure they get the treatment they need for their own health or safety, or for the protection of other people. In 2011/12 the number of men and women sectioned in England reached 48,600 - a five per cent rise on the previous year. In its annual Mental Health Act report the CQC also raised concerns that patients were not informed of their right to see a lawyer. The report says one in five patients were not informed of their right to see an independent mental health advocate. Officials also said they were worried about cultures where 'control and containment are prioritised over the treatment and support of individuals'. The report says: 'The human rights of patients are often affected by controlling practices that only seem to serve the hospital’s needs. 'Hospitals have a difficult task in balancing the realities of detention and compulsory treatment with the requirement that they provide services according to a principle of least restriction on patients. 'But it has proved all too easy for cultures to develop in which blanket rules deny people their basic rights - especially the right to dignity.' The CQC said hospitals should ensure there are no 'blanket rules' which deny patients autonomy and dignity. The health watchdog also said it was worried about the strain on services.Experts found that one in 16 wards had more patients than beds and 10 per cent were operating at full capacity. But some patients have 'irregularities' in their records which could mean they are being unlawfully detained . 'Pressures on beds continued to put services and patients under stress, making it harder to provide appropriate care for people in times of crisis,' the report says. 'In 2011/12, 93 wards (6 per cent of all wards) visited had more patients than beds; a further 10 per cent were at full capacity.' The report added: 'Patients are being affected by reductions in staff numbers. For example, Mental Health Act commissioners raised concerns in 77 visits that a lack of staff prevented patients taking escorted leave.' The CQC said mental health services must do much more to ensure the care they provide for detained and non-detained patients in mental health hospitals is based on individual needs. CQC chief executive David Behan said: 'People who need treatment in hospital for their mental health should have care and support to help them recover. The health watchdog is also worried about the strain on services. Experts found that one in 16 wards had more patients than beds and 10 per cent were operating at full capacity . 'Some hospitals are doing a very good job in treating people with dignity and respect - so we know it’s possible. However, CQC is concerned that some hospitals have allowed cultures to develop where control and containment are prioritised over treatment and care. 'This applies as much to detained patients as well as to those who are receiving treatment on a voluntary basis. 'In fact it is even more important people can be compulsorily treated - greater attention needs to be paid to ensuring as much dignity and choice as possible is promoted. Boards, providers and commissioners of service need to ensure that the proper safeguards and care practices are available to patients. 'Our report has found too many instances where people have been restricted inappropriately. It is unacceptable for the current situation to continue. 'All patients, whether detained under the Mental Health Act or not, need to be involved in their own care and consulted on their own wishes and desires. Clinical staff must be trained in assessing and recording patients’ capacity and consent.” Dr Andrew McCulloch, chief executive at the Mental Health Foundation, said: 'It’s frustrating to see that the findings provided by the report remain pretty much the same year after year in showing large over-representation of certain black and minority ethnic groups. 'A lot of work has been done to identify the specific problems that need to be addressed, but neither Government nor providers seem willing to make the long-term commitment to working with local communities that will be required to deliver change. 'Finally, we are very concerned by the reported lack of understanding of the Mental Capacity Act amongst many staff. Urgent work is needed to educate those responsible for implementing this Act on the ground.'","4% of sectioned patients have 'irregularities' in their records, meaning they could be unlawfully detained .

Out: Energy Secretary Steven Chu, pictured, is the latest of President Barack Obama's cabinet to announce his departure . Energy Secretary Steven Chu is the latest of President Barack Obama's cabinet to announce his departure. The 64-year-old Nobel laureate in physics came under fire for his handling of a $528 million federal loan to solar panel manufacturer Solyndra during his tenure, after the company collapsed in 2011 and 1,100 workers lost their jobs. But he will also be remembered for accomplishments including helping to plug a massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Chu offered his resignation to President Obama in a letter on Friday. He said he will stay on at least until the end of February and may stay until a successor is confirmed. Chu's decision to step down had been widely expected and follows announcements by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson and Jane Lubchenco, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that they are leaving. The White House said no decisions have been made on replacements for any of the environment and energy jobs but said Obama's priorities will remain unchanged. Potential replacements for Chu include former North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and former Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire. Obama said in a statement on Friday that Chu brought a 'unique understanding of both the urgent challenge presented by climate change and the tremendous opportunity that clean energy represents for our economy.' During his tenure, Chu helped move the country toward energy independence, Obama said, citing Energy Department programs to boost renewable energy such as wind and solar power. 'Thanks to Steve, we also expanded support for our brightest engineers and entrepreneurs as they pursue groundbreaking innovations that could transform our energy future,' Obama said. Chu, a former director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, had little political experience before taking the energy post in 2009. Praise: President Obama, pictured center, praised Chu, right, for his achievements in the post . He drew fire from congressional Republicans who criticized his handling of a $528 million federal loan to solar panel maker Solyndra, which later went bankrupt, laying off its 1,100 workers. Republicans said Chu and other Energy Department officials missed many warning signs about problems at Solyndra and compounded them by approving a restructuring of the loan even after problems were discovered. Solyndra was the first renewable-energy company to receive a loan guarantee under the 2009 stimulus law, and the Obama administration frequently promoted the company as a model for its clean energy program. Chu attended a 2009 groundbreaking when the loan was announced, and Obama visited the company's Fremont, Calif., headquarters the next year. The company's implosion in 2011 and revelations that the administration hurried a review of the loan in time for the groundbreaking became an embarrassment for Chu and Obama and a rallying cry for GOP critics of the administration's green energy program. Under fire: The 64-year-old Nobel laureate in physics, pictured, came under fire for his handling of a $528 million federal loan to Solyndra . Lawmakers also criticized Chu for approving the plan to restructure Solyndra's debt so that two private investors moved ahead of taxpayers for repayment in case of default. Chu defended the Solyndra loan during a sometimes testy hearing in late 2011. While calling the ultimate outcome 'regrettable,' Chu said the loan was subject to 'proper, rigorous scrutiny and healthy debate' before it was approved in 2009. 'While we are disappointed in the outcome of this particular loan, we support Congress' mandate to finance the deployment of innovative technologies and believe that our portfolio of loans does so responsibly,' Chu said. The White House said Chu retained Obama's confidence, but Chu was widely expected to leave following Obama's re-election last fall. In a letter to Energy Department employees, Chu said he was proud of his tenure and cited dozens of accomplishments, including doubling the production of renewable energy from wind and solar power. Installations of small solar electric, or photovoltaic, systems have nearly doubled in each of the last three years, he said, while 42 per cent of new energy capacity in the U.S. last year was from wind —more than any other energy source, Chu said. Embarrassing: Solyndra's implosion in 2011 and revelations that the administration hurried a review of the loan in time for the groundbreaking became an embarrassment for Chu and Obama . 'I came with dreams and am leaving with a set of accomplishments that we should all be proud of,' he said. One of his accomplishments was something that Chu rarely talked about: Obama repeatedly credits Chu with helping to plug the massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Chu and a team of engineers helped devised an interim solution before a replacement well permanently plugged the leak, which spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil in the worst offshore oil disaster in the country's history. When Chu resigned, he singled out for praise Christine Gregoire, hinting she may be a possibility for the Obama administration's energy and climate team. Chu lauded Gregoire, a Democrat who served as governor of Washington state from 2005 until mid-January and is long-time backer of President Barack Obama. Possible successor: Chu heaped praise on Christine Gregoire, pictured, hinting she may be a possibility for the Obama administration's energy and climate team . 'I am especially appreciative of . Governor Gregoire for her trust and support over the past six months,' Chu said in a lengthy resignation letter on Friday. Chu worked with Gregoire on the clean-up of the Hanford site in Washington, one of the U.S. nuclear weapons development facilities. Working on the nuclear waste issue with Gregoire and others has taken about five to 10 hours per week of his time over the last six months, Chu said in the letter. Gregoire, 65, has worked on nuclear waste issues for decades. As a deputy state attorney general in the mid 1980s, Gregoire lobbied the federal government to disclose any health risks from contamination at Hanford. Sources close to Gregoire say she has been vetted by the White House as a possible choice for a number of posts, including energy secretary, interior secretary and Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Gregoire was an early supporter of Obama in his first White House race, and in doing so broke with Washington's U.S. senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, who supported Hillary Clinton. In his letter, Chu said the Energy Department made 'historic progress' in cleaning nuclear contamination left from Cold War weapons development. 'Despite this progress, the environmental clean-up projects still have considerable technical and project management challenges,' he added. Millions of gallons of toxic radioactive waste are stored in underground tanks at Hanford, a possible threat to the nearby Columbia River, which runs between Oregon and Washington State. Security at the government's nuclear facilities would also fall to Gregoire if she became energy secretary. During Chu's tenure, the Energy Department suffered an embarrassment when an 82-year-old nun and two peace activists broke into the government's maximum security facility for weapons grade uranium in Oakridge, Tennessee.","The 64-year-old Nobel laureate in .

Sarah Capewell watched helplessly as doctors left her baby to die because he was born two days too prematurely. Despite pleas to save her son, medics said they were following guidelines that babies born before 22 weeks should not be treated. In the months following the tragedy, Miss Capewell vowed to become a mother again, but suffered miscarriage after miscarriage. Joy: Sarah Capewell with baby Melodie, who she described as a 'miracle' after having 12 miscarriages . Then, after becoming pregnant for the 13th time, against all medical predictions she gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Describing five-month-old Melodie as a miracle, the 28-year-old said: ‘I never thought this moment would come. After all that happened I can’t believe she is really mine. I keep pinching myself. When I fell pregnant for the 13th time I was sure it would end in more heartbreak. ‘The birth was hard because I had flashbacks going back to the same hospital to give birth in the same place where my son had died. I was terrified it would happen again.’ Miss Capewell, from Great Yarmouth, was already a mother to Jodie, now eight, and had suffered five unexplained miscarriages trying for a second child. So after she became pregnant in May 2008, she was delighted when it appeared to be progressing smoothly. But in October – 21 weeks and four days into her pregnancy – her waters broke. She went into labour the next day. Doctors said her unborn child would not receive medical care unless she held on for another 48 hours – passing 22 weeks gestation. Last touch: Sarah's son Jayden, who died after being born prematurely, holds on to his mother's hand before he died . The guidance is not compulsory but advises doctors that medical intervention for very premature children is not in the best interests of the baby and is not ‘standard practice’. With just hours to go, she begged doctors for help, but they refused, even after Jayden was born alive. ‘I’d been warned he would be stillborn but as his heart was beating I felt sure they would help. They never did. I pleaded, I wanted to put him in the incubator myself but didn’t know how to switch it on. ‘I cuddled him and he died in my arms two hours after he was born, taking part of me with him.’ After losing Jayden, she had several miscarriages before becoming pregnant last year. After her complications, she was booked for a caesarean on August 21. She said: ‘I’d prepared myself for something to go wrong so when my fiancé walked in holding a healthy baby I was shocked. I broke down in tears when he handed her to me. She was perfect in every way.’","Sarah Capewell gave birth to baby after a number of miscarriages .

A policewoman who was guarding Downing Street on the night the Plebgate affair unfolded was arrested yesterday. The 46-year-old constable from the Diplomatic Protection Group was held over alleged leaks to the Press. She was on duty when Andrew Mitchell, who was the Tory chief whip at the time, asked officers to open the main gate so he could cycle through. Investigation: Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, right, ordered an investigation into the 'Plebgate' affair that forced former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, left, to resign . When the officers refused, Mr Mitchell swore at them before pushing his bicycle through the pedestrian exit. A police log, which was written by one male and one female officer, claimed Mr Mitchell called officers ‘f****** plebs’. The September 19 log was leaked to a newspaper and led to the resignation of the chief whip. Last night it remained unclear whether the officer who was arrested was the policewoman who helped write the log. Fresh evidence, including this CCTV evidence, has emerged since the row which has raised questions about what really happened . The constable was arrested at her workplace in central London on suspicion of misconduct in a public office. She is the fourth arrest in the investigation, which is called Operation Alice.

Climbing the stairs or raking the leaves is as good for your heart as going to the gym, scientists claim. A study has shown that short bursts of activity throughout the day are just as beneficial as regular workouts in the gym. Light exercises, such as simply walking around while talking on the phone, all add up to help stave off disorders that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Every little helps: Researchers say activities such as climbing the stairs or raking leaves can be as beneficial for your health as going to the gym . Professor Brad Cardinal, of Oregon State University in the US, the study’s co-author and an expert in exercise and sport science, said: ‘This is a more natural way to exercise – just to walk more and move around a bit more.’ The researchers found that 43 per cent of those who did light exercise –including everyday chores that take a minute or two each – met government physical activity guidelines of 30 minutes per day, compared with less than 10 per cent of those who worked out. Professor Cardinal added: ‘People get it in their minds that if they don’t get 30 minutes they might as well not exercise at all. ‘You will always be presented with things that entice you to sit or be less active – such as using a leaf blower instead of a rake. ‘Making physical activity a way of  life is more cost-effective than an expensive gym membership. ‘You’ll be healthier, more mobile and just feel better all round.' Prof Cardinal said instead of driving . half a mile, people should try biking or walking the same distance. He also suggested doing sit ups, push ups or jumping jacks through TV . commercials.","Climbing the stairs or raking leaves can be as good as going to the gym .

One in 10 pupils at more than 1,600 schools play truant so often they miss a month’s lessons every year, latest figures have revealed. There are 677 primary schools and 977 secondary schools where more than 10 per cent of students miss more than one in six days. One MP said the figures were ‘deeply worrying’ and urged parents to take more responsibility for making children their children got the education that they need. There are 160,000 schools where one in 10 pupils miss 15 per cent of lessons (picture posed by models) Published figures for the last full school year show the scale of ‘persistent absentees’ in England’s schools. A total of 76 schools  - 50 secondary and 26 primary - have more than 20 per cent of pupils classes as ‘persistent absentees’ for missing more than 15 per cent of lessons. Under rules introduced last September, headteachers can now impose a £60 spot fine on parents who condone truancy, up from £50 under the Labour government. But ministers have been urged to go further and consider docking child benefit from parents who refuse to pay fines. Tory MP Andrew Griffths, who uncovered . the figures in parliament, said: ‘It is deeply worrying to uncover that . so many pupils are missing vital days of schooling. ‘Of . course the teachers and schools have a role to play in tackling . absences but it is also the responsibility of parents to make sure that . their children attend school to get the education that they require.’ Crays Hill Primary School in Basildon, Essex, whic is attended by children from the Dale Farm Traveller's Camp, recorded the highest level of persistent absentees in 2010-11 . Education Secretary Michael Gove has . warned of an ‘educational underclass’ of children who will never spend . enough time in school to achieve academic success. Challenged . over the coalition’s record on attendance recently, education minister . Elizabeth Truss said: ‘The Government agreed Charlie Taylor's . recommendation to tackle truancy by improving pupils' overall . attendance, and by focusing in primary schools to tackle poor attendance . early. Education minister Elizabeth Truss has insisted the government has toughened up fines for parents whose children play truant . ‘And we have uprated the penalty fines for parents who shirk their responsibility to ensure their children attend school.’ The Department for Education insisted that overall levels of persistent absenteeism had fallen from 8.6 per cent in 2006-07 . to 6.1 per cent in 2010-11. Among secondary schools, Sir Henry Cooper School in Kingston upon Hull record the highest level, with 31 per cent of pupils missing more than 15 per cent of school days. At five schools - Primrose High School in Leeds, David Lister School in Kingston upon Hull, The Basildon Upper Academy in Essex, Childwall School in Liverpool and the Manchester Creative and Media Academy for Boys - the proportion of persistent absentees stood at 25 per cent. A full breakdown of the figures for primary schools shows that almost a third (32 per cent) of pupils at Stanbridge Lower School in Bedfordshire were persistent absentees, rising to 43 per cent at Braybrooke Primary School in Northamptonshire and 84 per cent at Crays Hill Primary School in Essex, which is the local school of the controversial Dale Farm traveller site. Hayley Dyer, headteacher, Crays Hill Primary School said: ‘The school has made great strides in improving attendance over the last three years. ‘Engaging with our parents about the importance of continuous education has seen this improve month on month particularly during this academic year. ‘We of course recognise there is still some way to go and while the school is sensitive to the cultural traditions of our pupils we are clear in communicating with parents that good attendance enables their children to learn to their full potential.’ A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'Poor attendance at school can have a permanent and damaging effect on a child’s education and development. 'That is why we have lowered the persistent absence threshold so schools tackle the problem earlier – and in fact the number of pupils persistently absent has continuously fallen over the last five years.'","Latest figures reveal the scale of 'persistent absentees' who do not turn up for at least 15% of school days .

Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Jay Ratliff has been arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated just a little over a month after tragedy struck the team in a similar fashion. The 31-year-old nose tackle was arrested shortly after midnight after his pickup truck sideswiped a semitrailer truck on Texas 114 in eastern Grapevine, 20 miles northwest of Dallas. No one was injured, but Ratliff failed a field sobriety test and was taken to city jail, said Grapevine police Officer Sam Shemwell. [caption . Jailed: No one was injured, but Ratliff failed a field sobriety test and was taken to city jail . Ratliff declined a breath test, but police obtained a blood sample for testing, Shemwell said. Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple declined comment. The case will go to the Tarrant County district attorney's office in Fort Worth, Shemwell said. If convicted, Ratliff could get up to six months in jail. Ratliff was limited to six games this season with ankle and groin injuries. The arrest came less than a month after fellow Cowboys player Josh Brent was indicted on an intoxicated manslaughter count in the December 8 crash that killed his friend and Cowboys practice squad member Jerry Brown. Both Ratliff and Brent play the same position - nose tackle. Brent remains free on $100,000 bond. Findings: An autopsy found that Jerry Brown, left, was sober when he died from head and neck trauma in the December crash, while teammate Josh Brent, right, was driving while legally drunk . Lessons: Ratliff is pictured at a memorial service for Jerry Brown last month . Police in the Dallas suburb of Irving say Brent was speeding when his vehicle struck a curb and flipped. Brown was pronounced dead at an area hospital. A subsequent investigation found that . Brown was not intoxicated at the time of the crash, but Brent was two . times the legal limit. Brent's . blood alcohol level was 0.18, meaning a person his weight would have to . drink about 20 shots over a four-hour period to reach that level. Intoxication manslaughter carries a . maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but Brent could be eligible for . probation if convicted. An autopsy found that Dallas Cowboys practice squad player Jerry Brown Jr was sober when he was killed. Fatal: . Police say Brent had a blood alcohol limit of 0.18 percent - more than . twice the legal limit - when he crashed his Mercedes in Dallas and . killed his teammate . The Dallas County Medical Examiner's . Office reported Thursday that Brown died of head and neck trauma when . their vehicle overturned. He . had a dislocated neck, a severely bruised spine and a blood alcohol . content of 0.056 per cent. That's well below the Texas drunken driving . standard of 0.08 per cent. Police have said Brent had a blood alcohol level twice the legal . limit when after the December 8 crash in Irving, a Dallas suburb. The medical examiner’s report stated . that Brown, 25, sustained abrasions on the right and left forehead and a . cut on his left eyebrow. Neither man was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the collision, according to officials. Wreck: Tire skid marks are seen leaving the road where the car driven by Dallas Cowboys player Josh Brent crashed, killing Jerry Brown Jr . Cowboys coach Jason Garrett has said that the team would continue to support Brent despite the revelation. 'Josh . is a member of our family and we will continue to support him in every . way that we can and at the same time try to help other people who are in . a similar kind of situation.' A number of witnesses came forward to say that Brown was alive and screaming for help after Brent crashed the car. Stacee McWilliams, 40, from Irving, told police that when she stopped at the scene of the  accident, she practically had to beg Brent to help his best friend out of the Mercedes, which was upside down and on fire. Legal woes: Brent, who is charged with intoxication manslaughter that left his close friend dead, is out of jail on $100,000 bail . She said: 'I jumped out and ran out toward the wreck. I yelled to Brent, ""Are you OK? Are you OK?"" And he told me he was fine as he was pacing back and forth. 'I was relieved because I thought, it’s just a single-car accident, nobody’s hurt. And then fire sparked up from the car and got bigger and I started to hear screams. Brent’s attorney, George Milner, called McWilliams’ account 'absolutely false'. 'What I’ve been told is that Jerry Brown was never conscious after the accident,' Milner said. 'This woman, while present in the area of the accident, could not have seen or heard anything she said about Josh. It is now believed that the two close friends started their night at Eddie V's restaurant in Oak Lawn before moving on to a night club in northwest Dallas, CBS DFW reported. Memorial: Brown's Dallas Cowboys jersey is carried into the Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship education center . Sadness: Brown's relatives embracing ahead of a memorial service last week for the 25-year-old player . The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission has launched an investigation to determine whether the two football players were over-served, and if so, by whom. Eddie V's released a statement, saying in part that the establishment takes 'the responsibility that comes with serving alcohol very seriously.' It was not Brent's first run-in with the law - or intoxication charge. In February 2009, Brent was arrested in February 2009 near the Illinois campus for driving under the influence, driving on a suspended license and speeding, according to Champaign County, Illinois. In June 2009, he pleaded guilty to DUI and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, two years of probation, 200 hours of community service and a fine of about $2,000. As part of his plea deal, prosecutors dropped one count of aggravated DUI/no valid driver's license. Brent successfully completed his probation in July 2011, court records show. The Cowboys had signed Brown to their practice squad on October 24, but he hasn't been on the active roster. He was released from the Colts' practice squad on October 20. Brown played in one game for the Colts, a loss to the New York Jets on October 14.","Jay Ratliff booked after minor accident with semitrailer truck in Grapevine, Texas .

Luxury holiday chalets worth millions of pounds could fall into the sea following a series of huge landslides triggered by heavy rain. Some 18 wooden chalets - which cost up to £200,000 each - have been damaged or have slumped towards the cliff edge at Monmouth Beach near Lyme Regis, Dorset, after 500 tons of mud and earth pushed the buildings forward during the landslides. The steady deluge has built up behind the cabins which are now precariously perched on the sloping cliff, with one even tilted up at a 30 degree angle. Disaster: The chalets at Monmouth Beach in Dorset are falling into the sea after huge landslides triggered by heavy rain . The landslide has rendered the stretch of Britain’s Jurassic Coast so unsafe it has been closed off to the public. Lyme Regis Town Council, which owns the land, has also announced it will not renew the licences for 11 of the chalets and are asking owners to remove them as the area is no longer safe. The buildings themselves are said to be worth up to £70,000 but the added value of the stunning location has seen some sell for as much as £200,000. This means that £130,000 has now been wiped off the value of the 11 chalets. One owner, who wished not to be named, said: 'Some people are covered by insurance and some are not. Luckily for us our property is. 'We are only allowed to insure it up to £70,000. The total value of ours was £200,000 so the rest of the value is the location and the ongoing licence. This chalet worth £200,000 has been so badly damaged it could be pulled down before it falls into the sea . The stretch of Britain's Jurassic Coast at Monmouth Beach in Dorset is so unsafe it has had to be closed . The beach remains closed to the public after huge landslides which has destroyed holiday homes . 'The logistics of taking it down . would be too difficult so we are going to leave it where it is and it . will probably end up hitting the beach 30ft below. 'It will only be good for fire wood then.' Because the cliff is continually moving with no end in sight it is now feared all of the buildings will be written off. Another chalet owner said: 'Our family have had the chalet over 60 years. 'It’s worth about £200,000 and it’s probably going to end up in the sea the way things are going. 'Our chalet has slipped about six feet in the last six days. It is moving frighteningly fast and there is only one place these chalets are going to end up - on the beach. 'The pressure from the cliffs above is pushing the land down. 'The local council has told us it’s not too bad but they are just burying their heads in the sand. 'There are about 18 chalets which are closed at the moment and are directly affected by the landslides.' Geologist Richard Edmonds, the earth science manager for Dorset County Council’s Jurassic Coast team, said the continuous movement meant not a lot could be done to save the homes. The owners of 18 chalets are being allowed into their one-bed holiday homes one at a time to clear out their belongings . Some of the chalets are precariously perched on a cliff after mud built up behind the buildings and pushed them towards the sea . Devastated: One chalet owner has had his holiday home for 60 years but now it could be written off following the landslide . 'About ten chalets are affected by the movement and I’m afraid it is a matter of waiting and seeing what nature does. 'The last big landslide we had here was in 2008 and we could get another at any time. 'The movement is coming from the back of the cliff and the land is slumping forward because of the rain. That is pushing the chalets forward in the process.' The chalets are privately owned but the land they are on is owned by Lyme Regis Town Council . A landslide that occurred at Monmouth Beach last month saw a £140,000 chalet, which had only been bought by its new owners last May, toppled over. The holiday homes, that overlook Lyme Bay, can only be lived in for nine months of the year and are empty over the winter. They are privately owned but the land they are on is owned by Lyme Regis Town Council which receives £2,500 a year in rent from each plot. John Wright, town clerk at Lyme Regis . Town Council, said: 'The licences for 11 chalets will not be renewed . when the current ones expire on March 1 as things stand. 'We want people to take the appropriate action to remove their properties from the site. 'Our advice at the moment is for people not to go anywhere near their chalets. 'It is impossible to predict how long this will go on for.' Graham Turner, from Lyme Regis coastguard, said: 'It’s a major problem for the chalet owners. 'The chalets are on concrete pillars and they are being moved forward. 'One went over and was hanging there at angle of about 30 degrees. 'Another four have moved so much that the steps leading up to them are now nowhere near the doors. 'In general the movement is quite slow but it is constant now. 'I just don’t know what can be done to stop it. It is an act of nature.' Monmouth Beach is named after the Duke of Monmouth, who landed there in 1685 during his attempt to take the crown from King James II. Following the defeat of the Duke of Monmouth, twelve locals were hanged on the beach.","As many as 18 holiday homes have been damaged or have slumped towards the sea at Monmouth Beach in Dorset after heavy rain .

It comes as Malian soldiers were accused of . using torture tactics similar to waterboarding on three al-Qaeda-linked . terrorists captured during the liberation of Timbuktu. The three men are being held in an earthen cell in what remains of the military camp in Timbuktu, which was captured by French and Malian soldiers after nearly 10 months under the rule of radical Islamists. The men, who were tied together with a turban and one handcuff, admitted to reporters to being members of the al-Qaeda-linked group known as Ansar Dine, or Defenders of the Faith.

He initially denied being part of Ansar Dine but later confirmed that he belonged to the movement though he denied having an important role. The Malian military said that when he was arrested he was wearing a watch with a memory card inside that they said was used to communicate with other foreign jihadists. The allegations of torture made public Friday in Timbuktu come as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released reports Friday outlining other allegations of misconduct by the Malian military over the last month. According to Amnesty International witnesses claim the Malian army had arrested more than 24 civilians on the eve of the French-led intervention some of whom are feared to have been killed .

Amnesty International cited witnesses saying the Malian army had arrested more than 24 civilians on the eve of the French-led intervention on Jan. 11. Amnesty says it is feared that many were later killed by soldiers and some bodies were thrown down a well in Sevare. The Associated Press had earlier reported killings of civilians by the Malian army in Sevare, with bodies dumped in a well. The Malian government has promised to investigate allegations of human rights abuses by its soldiers. France has said that it eventually wants to hand over responsibility for the mission to the Malian army and other African counterparts.","250 soldiers dropped in above Timbuktu airport as part of operation Serval to recapture historic city .

Prince Charles has attacked British schools for failing to install ‘character’ in pupils and making them virtually unemployable. The Prince said the education system is leaving children bereft of vital life skills and unable to develop the confidence needed to develop into successful adults. While conceding the importance of academic education, Charles stressed pupils need to be taught to cope with the world that awaits them if they were to have a chance of getting a job. Prince Charles told business leaders at St James's Palace yesterday that the education system is leaving children bereft of vital life skills . The royal was speaking to business leaders at St James’s Palace yesterday, after a visit to a project which helps unemployed young people turn their lives around. Speaking of the visit, he said: ‘What was being said is that life skills – which consist of developing self-esteem, self-confidence, looking people in the eye – all these things are not taught in schools or hardly at all. ‘What it seems we’re lacking is that element in educational process of character, alongside all the other bits and pieces which are of course important. ‘But if you can’t actually cope with the world out there, the kind of interaction that’s required of people, it is impossible it seems to me to manage, let alone to be employable.’ The royal attacked British schools for failing to install 'character' in pupils and making them virtually unemployable . Prince Charles arrives at Circle Sports in North London yesterday, an organisation which helps young people get the best of themselves . While conceding the importance of academic education, Charles stressed pupils need to be taught to cope with the world that awaits them if they were to have a chance of getting a job . Some within the educational establishment may find the comments inflammatory, but the Prince has long been a passionate supporter of youth opportunity initiatives through organisations such as his own charity, The Prince’s Trust. But some observers will find irony in the speech coming after the emergence at the weekend of letters written by the Queen Mother, in which she begged for Charles, her grandson, not to be sent to Gordonstoun – a school in Scotland with a reputation for character-building – because she thought he would be unhappy. Charles did go to Gordonstoun, which because of its Spartan regime he dubbed ‘Colditz in kilts’. One contemporary recalled that Charles was bullied ‘maliciously, cruelly and without respite’. Earlier yesterday, the Prince visited Circle Sports, a not-for-profit community sports shop in a deprived area of Westminster which has an 80 per cent success rate in helping young develop skills to find work. Tameima Khano, 24, is working with a large toy retailer after completing a training course. She told Charles: ‘I had no confidence before I came here, I could not talk to people. I’m now able to communicate a lot better.’ Onlooker Julia Aguiar made the Prince laugh when she called out ‘Hello darling’ as he emerged from the shop and asked whether he had tried any trainers on. ‘Why, certainly not!’ joked Prince Charles, after which the crowd of members of the public erupted with laughter.

An artist who uses old denim jeans to create pictures of London street scenes is taking the art world by storm. Ian Berry started making the denim pieces of art full-time after he was made redundant from his job as an art director. The 28-year-old hasn't looked back since and recently returned from an art exhibition in Miami, Florida where his work fetched £4,500 a piece. Taking the art world by storm: Artist Ian Berry takes old denim jeans, cuts them up and glues them back together to depict London street scenes . Among his collection are pictures of the London Underground, Piccadilly Circus, Hampstead Heath and Camden Town. Mr Berry was first inspired to take up his denim art when he found some old jeans while clearing his old room after returning home from university in 2006. To produce the works of art, Mr Berry cuts pieces of denim into precise shapes before painstakingly gluing them all together. Although he mainly uses old jeans he also likes to dabble with old denim jackets and dresses. Jean-ius: Ian Berry stands in front of some of his work on display in an art gallery in Miami . To achieve different looks, he sometimes uses bleach, either with a stencil and spray, and  experiments with different colour jeans. Mr Berry hunts around charity shops to find old jeans and friends and family also donate theirs to him. He also has a supply from a warehouse in Sweden. Mr Berry said: ‘Anything denim I will use. Jeans are obviously the major ones I use but I do like the jackets as they have lots of interesting bits like seams to play with. ‘I like to use coloured jeans sometimes. People see them and ask if it is paint or something. But it is all jeans. Change of direction: Mr Berry started making the pictures after he was made redundant from his job as an art director . Waste not, want not: The pictures are all created using old denim and show scenes such as the London Underground, Piccadilly Circus, Hampstead Heath and Camden Town . Unique: Mr Berry uses bleach, with a stencil or a spray to achieve different looks in his pictures . ‘I have probably had a thousand pairs of jeans. I end up rationing some of the better shades as they really can set a piece off. ‘I don't throw any away and I have a system of areas where smaller and smaller bits go. ‘The smallest pieces will be saved for things such as bushes and trees.’ Mr Berry's denim art comes in all sizes and he once did a mural on a wall in Indiana, USA, which measured eight feet by eight feet. To make the art Mr Berry, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, sits on the floor with the denim hanging around him. Inspiration: Mr Berry started the denim art after he found some old jeans while clearing his room in 2006 . Painstaking: Ian uses extra sharp scissors to cut different pieces of denim into precise shapes before gluing it all together . Lengthy process: Mr Berry can spend up to half a day looking for the right piece of denim for his piece . Finding the correct piece of denim, even for the smallest detail in his pictures, can take up to half a day. He has made around 80 pictures so far but says the rate at which he makes them will decrease as  he spends more time on each individual piece. He said: ‘There will probably be less and less made each year as I get more detailed and make bigger images. ‘I really wish I could make them faster but I'm more interested in making the work better than making more. ‘The commission list is getting longer and longer, but I concentrate on the gallery shows as this is more important. ‘I think if people want them they will wait. I'm not after a quick buck. I would only take interesting commissions on anyway.’","Ian Berry started making pieces full-time after he was made redundant .

A woman spends up to 15 hours a day confined to a den, known as a Faraday cage, because she claims to have an intolerance to modern technology. Velma, 51, says she finds it impossible to use a mobile phone, satnav or WiFi, because they emit pulsed microwave radiation. She has to eat and sleep inside a homemade Faraday cage as she says this gives her relief from her symptoms. Velma with her electro sensor: She says the stable electromagnetic field within her Faraday cage steadies her vibrational system . Velma sleeping in her homemade Faraday cage. She says the introduction of the 3G network has worsened her symptoms . She suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity intolerance syndrome (EHS) which means she cannot stand to be near pulsed electromagnetic fields. Velma’s condition emerged with the arrival of 3G mobile phones, although she says a previous electric shock as a teenager may have made her more susceptible. Velma, who has been unable to work since suffering from RSI and a compressed nerve on her spine, suffers agonising head and nerve pain, memory loss, tinnitus, ectopic heart beats, vertigo and aching joints if she goes near mobile phones, WIFI and satnav. She is forced to spend much of each day in a makeshift Faraday cage in her flat in London. However, in the summer she takes the opportunity to escape to a park as she says this helps to earth her system. Velma made the Faraday cage herself from off-cut material costing £300. A ready-made version would have cost her £800. She claims metal fibres in the netting shield her from the microwave signals and stop her from suffering EHS symptoms. She . said: 'I can’t do anything that normal people do, like eating, reading, writing, studying, whilst being exposed to microwave signals without experiencing symptoms. It’s made my life a living hell.' Velma with a laptop she bought from an American website that she says has shielding to lower electromagnetic radiation (left) and eating in her Faraday cage (right) Velma at home her supplements: She takes them in groups at different times to help with things like detoxing . Velma worked as a secretary for a number of firms in the 1980s. She said: 'Even back then I could feel a huge agitation when using the computer, but I thought it was just because I didn’t have the technological skills. 'Now I wonder if I was starting to experience the early symptoms of ES Electrosensitivity. 'I am studying at home whilst also undertaking training to become a Sound Therapist. 'I'm also looking to undertake a doctorate as I need to keep my brain active and I'm unable to work in a work or college environment. 'My friends are very supportive but there’s only so much time you can spend with the woman that can’t go anywhere or do anything. 'I used to love going to festivals and experiencing live music, but because everyone has a mobile I can’t even go near a gig now due to mobiles close to my head. 'The last gig I went to was Radiohead. I knew I was getting worse and wouldn’t be able to go to any more so I wanted to make it a good one. 'It’s so sad that I can no longer do the things I enjoy.' Velma out in her garden (left) and her Faraday cage (right). She says going outdoors and putting her feet on the earth helps to 'earth' her . Electrical Sensitivity, also known as Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity Intolerance Syndrome, is a controversial condition that is recognised in Spain and Sweden but not in the UK. Velma said: 'I’ve been to my GP countless times begging for tests, but GPs won't instigate the environmental tests needed. One neurological expert said there are people worse off than me and wouldn't help me. It is so frustrating that medicine isn’t keeping up with the technology. 'We desperately need a white zone - an area where there are low or no emissions - where we can go to relax and recuperate and detox.' Up to five per cent of the population believe they are affected by electrosensitivity and experience flu-like symptoms, headaches, lethargy and nausea when exposed to various appliances. Electromagnetic waves are everywhere and we are constantly bombarded by them from space. Although there is no evidence of any . permanent damage to the body from electromagnetic waves, some people . have reported that they feel unwell when they are within reach of WiFi . or mobile phone masts. WiFi waves are higher in frequency than mobile phones and are intense due to the amount of info they carry.Electrosensitivity is not recognised as a disability or a medical condition in the UK. The Health Protection Agency say there is no scientific evidence linking ill health with electrical equipment, although it recognises people do report real and distressing symptoms.Many medics are sceptical about electromagnetic hypersensitivity syndrome as a result, although some like Dr Mallery-Blythe think it is a real condition. The charity ElectroSensitivity UK is a support group for those who believe they suffer from it. She added to Mail Online: 'There are hundreds of us in the UK suffering from this condition. 'It's not just me - and it could happen to anyone.' Dr Erica Mallery-Blythe, who is a medical adviser for the charity ElectroSensitivity UK said: 'The symptoms of EHS can cover a broad range of systems, often start subtly and can be mistaken for other medical conditions. 'Adults and children today are exposed to very high levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF) that no life on the planet has ever witnessed before. 'It is no surprise that the numbers of those with EHS and other conditions linked with EMF exposure are rising.' Dr George Carlo, from Washington, added: 'One of the tragedies is that folks use these approaches - cages, shades, necklaces - to try to protect themselves, but those are not long-term solutions. 'They are simply survival mechanisms. The long-term solution is building the internal adaptive capacity that enables those with ES to be like the rest of us - living our lives without the incumbrance of awful ES-triggered symptoms.' In 2005, the Health Protection Agency said there was . no scientific evidence to link their ill health with electrical . equipment, although it said sufferers could have unpleasant . symptoms. The review did not look at the impact of waves from phone masts. However, in 2007 a double-blind study suggested electrosensitivity could be all in the mind. The research, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, found people who thought they were electrosensitive experienced symptoms when they were placed near a mobile phone mast and told it was 'switched on'. When the tests were repeated with the volunteers not knowing whether the masts were switched on or off, there was no relationship between their symptoms and the phone signals. Critics of the study said it only looked at short-term effects and used a fairly small sample size.","Velma made her own Faraday cage for £300 that she claims filters out pulsed electro-magnetic waves .

Cabinet minister Ken Clarke will today urge David Cameron to focus on the 'positives' of Brussels staying in the European Union as he helps launch a campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. The former Chancellor will be joined by Lib Dem treasury minister Danny Alexander and Labour's Lord Mandelson to front a ‘patriotic fightback’ against euroscepticism. Mr Clarke will defy anti-Europe sentiment in his party to insist the PM must 'concentrate on what we are in favour of and not just what we are against' while Mr Alexander will dismiss calls to withdraw from much of the EU as 'nonsensical'. Europhile Tory Ken Clarke will join Liberal Democrat Treasury minister Danny Alexander at the launch of the Centre for British Influence . The two coalition cabinet minister pair will be joined by former . Labour minister Lord Mandelson, a one-time EU trade commissioner, at the . launch of Centre for British Influence in Europe. In a provocative move the launch of the . Yes campaign to keep Britain in the European Union is being held in the . European Commission’s building in London’s Smith Square which used to . be occupied by the Conservative Party. Mr Clarke will use a speech at tonight's launch to urge 'strong support for a better European Union within which Britain can exert power and influence in the modern world'. Addressing an audience of 200 people from . the worlds of politics, the media, business, diplomacy, trade unions and . think tanks, he will say it is 'obvious' and 'essential' that the EU needs to reform in order for the UK to 'compete properly in a fiercely global marketplace'. 'The real challenge for us as we debate our role in the EU is working out what we should be pushing forward, what we should be leading on within the EU, to make it - and us - a more effective economic and global power,' he will add. 'We need to concentrate on what we are in favour of and not just what we are against.  There is a huge potential prize out there for the United Kingdom if only we focus our attention and influence in any future negotiations on the positive things that really matter. 'The fact is, that we are immensely powerful as part of a market of 500 million people.' Mr . Clarke, a Minister without Portfolio, is the most senior Conservative . figure to throw his weight behind the campaign against leaving the EU. As . the Prime Minister's special representative on EU-US trade talks with a . roving brief across Whitehall he remains one of the most well-known . figures on the Tory frontbench. But his Europhile opinions are sharply at odds with much of the rest of the Cabinet. Tory . party chairman Grant Shapps and London Mayor Boris Johnson have both . suggested they could vote to quit if Britain cannot get a better deal . from Brussels. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander will warn of the economic dangers of leaving Brussels . In a move likely to rile Tory . eurosceptics, the two government ministers will share a platform with . Lord Mandelson, who will insist anti-EU claims 'cannot go unchallenged anymore'. Lord Mandelson will say: 'I do not . regard today's event as firing the starting pistol for a referendum . campaign because there is a lot of water to flow under the bridge – . including the holding of a general election – before any point of . decision is reached on that. 'But the point is, for far too long, . those who want to destroy Britain's interests and influence in Europe . have been allowed to get away with murder with the lies and false . propaganda they have poured out about the European Union and what it . represents for our country. This cannot go unchallenged anymore. 'The pro Europeans have bided their time. Now we must unbide our time. 'My complaint is that, often in . Britain, we do not stand up for ourselves in Europe nearly as vigorously . and effectively as we should. 'Instead of heading up a cul de sac of . mindless, inward looking, soul searching and navel gazing, we should be . going out and spreading our influence and fighting for the agenda we . think is good for Britain and for Europe as a whole.' Mr Alexander, who before entering Parliament worked for campaign group Britain In Europe, will argue that Britain has a more powerful negotiating role 'inside Europe than from the sidelines'. 'The EU is not perfect by any stretch and I’m a big advocate of EU reform. 'But the idea that we should extract ourselves from the bulk of EU obligations is nonsensical. 'We can offer a more compelling . alternative: a strong UK, influential in Europe and so more influential . in the world. Stronger with America and China, because we are at the . heart of the EU.' David Cameron used a speech on European Union and Britain's role in it to promise to give Britons a straight referendum choice on whether to stay or leave . It comes as MPs debate David Cameron's landmark pledge of an in-out referendum by 2017. David Cameron used his long-awaited speech on Europe last week to promise a referendum on leaving the EU by 2017. The . Prime Minister said the Tories will promise at the next election to . renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, before putting the ‘fresh . settlement’ to a straight in-out vote. He said: '‘You will have an important choice to make about our country’s destiny.’ Organisers . of the new pro-EU campaign say they want to challenge misconceptions . the British public hold about Europe, including fears that it costs up . to a quarter of the nation’s economy while wielding little or no . influence in Brussels. It will publish an annual EU power league, to show how the UK benefits from continued membership. Peter Wilding, director of the CBIE, will say: 'We are assembling an army of supporters to fight Europhobia and promote a reform and growth agenda that serves the British national interest. Many British people think their country is powerless in Europe. 'This is fundamentally wrong and unpatriotic. Britain helped create modern Europe, our allies want us in and it is time we finished the job.' Details of the launch came as Tony Blair yesterday condemned plans for an in-out referendum and said Labour should make the case for staying in because it will rebuild the party’s relations with business leaders. The former prime minister told the German magazine Der Spiegel: ‘I have difficulties with the notion that we commit now to putting a referendum question with an out option. ‘If you believe as I believe that Britain leaving Europe would be very bad for Britain, then it’s a threat that is to do yourself damage. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said leaving the EU would be 'very bad' for Britain . ‘It is not good for Britain, never mind if it’s good for Europe, for us to question our membership in the EU -- and then leave that question hanging there for what could be four or five years.’ He added: ‘Labour should argue unequivocally for Britain to stay, it will help the party to build bridges to the business community, which is important.’ Mr Cameron won the support of 18 member states for a plan to reform the EU and the single market, which the new campaign backs. The PM has insisted he will vote with his ‘heart and soul’ to keep Britain in the EU if he gets a better deal. But the polls are split on whether voters would choose to stay in or sever all ties with Brussels. The UK Independence Party has seen its popularity soar in recent months. Tory Chancellor George Osborne has made clear his intention to make the EU referendum a key dividing line at the 2015 general election. He claimed Labour and the Liberal Democrats ‘do . not trust’ the British people with having a say on Europe. Today it was claimed Labour leader Ed Miliband had been talked out of promising an in-out referendum by his brother David, a former foreign secretary. A senior Labour figure claimed Ed vetoed the idea after David said it was 'too populist', The Sun reported. However, Labour's policy chief Jon Cruddas has long-argued for a referendum and is pushing Ed Miliband to change his mind.","Launch of Centre for British Influence marks a 'patriotic fightback'

The high-tech Aeroscraft blimp is now . nearly ready for flight testing in the open, having completed its 'first float' manoeuvres inside its colossal hangar in Orange County, California. The biggest challenge for engineers is . making sure the airship will be able to withstand high winds and other . extreme weather conditions, Mr Jojo-Verge said.

Built around a rigid frame of . aluminium and carbon fibre, the huge 230ft prototype, built by U.S. aviation firm Worldwide Aeros, is nevertheless only . half the size of its conceived finished version. Earlier pictures of the bulbous blimp, with its silver skin reflecting green lights shining within the hangar, invited comparisons with Thunderbird 2, the rescue craft from Gerry Anderson's puppet adventure series Thunderbirds. Military funded: The Department of Defense and NASA have invested $35 million in the prototype because of its potential to one day carry more cargo than any other aircraft to disaster zones and forward military bases . The airship has been undergoing . testing this . month in a 17-storey tall, Second World War-era blimp hangar at the . former Tustin Marine Corps Air Station. It must go through several more . rounds of flight tests before it could be used in a disaster zone or . anywhere else. But if and when it finally goes into . service, the Aeroscraft airship will carry three times as much as the . biggest military cargo planes, use a third of . the fuel - and it won't even need a landing strip. It could revolutionise haulage, and . almost everything now laboriously transported across the planet's . surface by boat, train and lorry could within years be carried through . the skies, its makers claim. Aeros said it also must secure more . funding for the next round of flight testing, but is hopeful the Defense . Department and others will step in again as investors. It says the cargo airship's potential . to carry more cargo more efficiently than ever before would provide the . military with an advantage on the battlefield and greater capacity to . save more lives during natural disasters. Impressive: Bradley Hasemeyer, the host of AOL's Translogic show, uses his smartphone to photograph the Aeroscraft airship inside its colossal hangar at the former Tustin Marine Corps Air Station in Orange County . Aeros CEO and Founder Igor Pasternak . recently confirmed the vehicle had completed a series of successful . 'first float' manoeuvres inside its immense engineering hangar. Mr Pasternak, who is also the chief . engineer of the Aeroscraft, explained that the tests had proven its . unique lightweight rigid structure conception and vertical take off and . landing systems. 'The first float of the vehicle was a . controlled exercise during which all flight systems were operating. The . procedure was completed successfully,' he said. Aircraft experts are betting that the Aeroscraft vehicle with its advanced . technology capabilities will transform the transportation of large and . heavy cargoes. It has the potential to support any . number of the world’s equipment-dependent mega-projects and the . industries that manage them – including wind energy, aerospace, fossil . fuel extraction, highway construction, engineering and . telecommunications. International rescue: The silver-skinned Aeroscraft prototype sits in its hangar, where green light reflecting from it makes it look uncannily like Thunderbird Two . A concept of the airship on the battlefield, where it could be used to transport tanks and soldiers directly onto the front line . The airship functions like a . submarine, releasing air to rise and taking in air to descend, said . Aeros mechanical engineer Tim Kenny. It can take off vertically, like a helicopter, then change its buoyancy to become heavier than air for landing and unloading. 'It allows the vehicle to set down on . the ground. And then when we want to become lighter than air, we release . that air and then the vehicle floats and we can allow it to take off,' Mr Kenny said. The radical design has been likened to that of Thunderbird 2 . The project has set abuzz the old . hangars at the Marine Corps Air Station. The structures were built to . hold blimps during the War. Now workers zip around in . cherry-pickers, and the airship's silvery surface shines against the . warm tones of the aging wood of the walls. 'You could take this vehicle and go to . destinations that have been destroyed, where there's no ports, no . runways, stuff like that,' said Mr Kenny . 'This vehicle could go in there, . offload the cargo even if there's no infrastructure, no landing site for . it to land on, this vehicle can unload its whole payload. ' The finished version of the Aeroscraft . - expected to be ready in three years - will be 450ft long and carry a . payload of 66 tons at a speed of 120 knots, up to 18,000ft with a range . of 3000 nautical miles. That could revolutionise air transport, opening up remote areas where there is practically no other means of access. It could carry relief supplies for . victims in disaster areas, heavy oil-extraction equipment to northern . Canada's tar sands, huge turbines to remote wind farms and, of course, . heavy military equipment to battlefields worldwide. Fill 'er up: At 77m (250ft) in length, the prototype Aeroscraft is just half the size of the final model, but has been built with the same rigid structure, flight control systems and landing gear . The 'skeleton' of the airship being built in California . The key breakthrough has been the development of an internal system for managing ballast. Previous airships have been held back . by the need to weigh them down or tie them up while cargo is unloaded, . lest they are suddenly carried away on the breeze. But the Aeroscraft's internal ballast . management system gives its operators the ability to control the . aircraft's buoyancy by compressing the helium inside its tanks and . replacing it with normal air to bring down to the ground. Once cargo has been loaded, the . airship can rise by re-releasing the compressed helium into its . containment tanks, making it again lighter than air, then using . turbo-prop engines to control its direction. Because of this revolutionary system, . Aeroscraft needs no airfield to operate, only a cleared area large . enough for it to vertically take off and land, and enough labour on hand . to unload the cargo. Limited: Conventional airships are held back by the need for infrastructure that can enable ground crews to fill them with ballast as they are unloaded to stop them from floating away on the breeze . Internal ballast: The Aeroscraft, by contrast, is able to control its buoyancy using an internal ballast management system which means it can land anywhere that there is space to touch down . Mr Pasternak, 48, told Gizmag: 'The . advantage is you don’t need ground infrastructure. You can fly anywhere, . you can land anywhere, you don’t need any ballast, you don’t need any . ground crew.' The airship has long been a 'dream machine' for visionary inventors. Count Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin . built the first airship in 1900 as a weapon for Germany. The 'Graf . Zeppelin' was developed by Dr Hugo Eckener, who flew it around the world . in 21 days in 1929. This powerful symbol of German might . was adopted by the Nazis, who funded the creation of the largest airship . yet, the Hindenburg. However, on May 6, 1937, the . Hindenburg burst into flames on a trip to the US, having been filled . with patriotic German hydrogen instead of American helium. The future: An artist's impression shows how the Aeroscraft might look as it picks up cargo from a distribution centre. Finished models will carry 66 tons over a distance of 3,000 nautical miles at 120 knots . The ship could also be used for major construction projects such as building large pipes, as it does not require a runway to land . But Ukrainian-born Mr Pasternak says . that his design for a rigid airship is miles apart from the disastrous . versions of the early 20th Century. He told Gizmag: 'From the structure stand point, all of us are familiar with the Hindenburg and Zeppelin designs. 'This is different. We built a space . frame that sits inside of the vehicle and around the frame we built a . rigid cell. The function of the rigid cell is to have it work with the . aerodynamic laws. It’s a very simple approach. 'It also allows us to build vehicles . very rapidly. When you’re talking about the production of vehicles, you . need the ability to build number of them in a short term and with the . frames you can do this.'","Aeroscraft has completed its 'first float' tests inside colossal WWII blimp hangar in Orange County, California .

Two dedicated Hillary Clinton supporters are launching a campaign to draft the resigning State Secretary to run for president in 2016. The group ‘Ready for Hillary’ filed as a super-PAC (political action committee) with the Federal Election Commission late last week in the first notable effort from an outside group to campaign on Clinton’s behalf. Allida Black and Judy Beck, two long-time Clinton supporters who were on Clinton’s Virginia Women’s Steering Committee in 2008 and helped her raise more than $100,000, are spearheading the effort, Washington, D.C.-based newspaper The Hill reports on its blog. Super-PAC: The group 'Ready for Hillary' filed as a super-PAC with the Federal Election Commission late last week in the first notable effort from an outside group to campaign on Clinton¿s behalf . Hot topic: Clinton¿s popularity ratings among Democrats and the broader electorate are soaring as talks of her potential run for president fuel further speculation on whether or not she will . The two also lead Women Count, a political action committee that sponsored ads fighting against calls for Clinton to resign early from the 2008 presidential race against Barack Obama. Black and Beck’s group plans to roll out a website for their ‘Ready for Hillary’ PAC in the upcoming weeks, they said. ‘This is not our first campaign. We know how to raise money. Most of us who are involved have done fundraisers before,’ Black told the Hill. ‘I certainly have had fundraisers for her at my house in Virginia. We're there to mobilize support for her in a variety of forms, both financial and grassroots. We're getting ready so that when she's ready, we've got the resources to help her do it.’ The duo said that about a dozen veterans of the 2008 Clinton presidential campaign were involved with their newly formed group. Most of those members are volunteers, fundraisers and committee delegates, rather than members of Clinton’s internal circle, they said.

Black said ‘the fireworks will begin’ when the group rolls out their pro-Clinton website in the next week or two, after Clinton officially steps down from her role as State Secretary. She told The Hill that she hasn’t seen Clinton in a year or so and doubted she had yet heard about the group’s efforts. Black said the group’s aim would not be to raise tons of money, but instead ‘to sustain a really devoted, organized following to support her run for president both on the ground and with whatever funds they can donate.’ ‘This is not Hillaryland,’ Black said. ‘I love Hillaryland. I was not officially part of Hillaryland; I was a volunteer. I worked with her on specific issues, which is one of the reasons why I'm so devoted to her candidacy.’ Clinton’s popularity ratings among Democrats and the broader electorate are soaring as talks of her potential run for president fuel further speculation on whether or not she will.

An RAF spy plane has been deployed to support the French military action in Mali as forces made a significant inroad by retaking Gao airport. The highly sophisticated Sentinel aircraft joins two giant C-17 transport aircraft which have been airlifting men and tons of supplies to the country fighting Islamist militants. Carrying a crew of five, the Sentinel has played a vital role in counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan and against Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. Scroll down for video . The Sentinel spy plane will join two C-17 transport aircraft helping French forces in Mali . David Cameron pledged extra help for the Mali mission this week amid concern over the situation in west Africa. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘As the Prime Minister has made clear, the UK supports France’s decision to provide military support to the Malian government. ‘Following NSC [National Security Council meeting] on Tuesday and discussions with the French, we have now decided to deploy Sentinel, a surveillance capability that has proved its worth in Libya and on an ongoing basis for counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan.’ Islamic extremists based in the Malian town of Ansongo destroyed a bridge near the Niger border yesterday, the first use of explosives by the insurgents since the start of the French-led military intervention two weeks ago. But French forces have regained three towns from the insurgents and today recaptured the airport in the Islamist stronghold of Gao, one of three provincial capitals controlled by the al-Qaida-linked rebels. French forces took control of the airport and a key bridge after an operation carried out under the cover of darkness in the early hours of this morning. The move comes just two weeks after France launched its military offensive to rout the Islamists from power in northern Mali. French and Malian forces came under fire in the morning and continued to face sporadic 'acts of harassment' in the afternoon, said Colonel Thierry Burkhard, a French military spokesman in Paris. He had no immediate estimate on casualties. The Islamists first seized control of Gao and two other northen provinicial capitals - Timbuktu and Kidal - in April last year during the chaotic aftermath of a coup in the distant capital Bamako. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced in a statement today that jihadist fighters who encountered the advancing French and Malian troops 'saw their means of transport and their logistics sites destroyed.' Before the joint air-land operations overnight, French forces carried out 'an important phase of air strikes' around Gao and Timbuktu, with nearly 30 bombs fired from fighter jets over the previous two days, the military said. More French and African troops and equipment were being sent to Gao, announced the French defense ministry. Troops from Chad and Niger 'should arrive in the Gao area very soon,' it added. Conflict: A French soldier secures an area during an ordinance clearing exercise at a destroyed Islamic militants camp in Mali . Ironically the RAF’s five Sentinels are to be retired in 2015, to save money –  only eight years after coming into service. Mr Cameron spoke earlier this week of a global 'generational struggle' against al Qaida-inspired Islamist terrorism in North Africa and said the UK should 'thicken' links with region following this month’s hostage crisis in Algeria. He said Britain will provide troops to an EU mission to train the Malian military to take on Islamist militants who have taken over the north of the country. The mission, due to deploy in February or March, is expected to include around 250 trainers and 250 force protection troops and Mr Cameron said the British contribution would number 'in the tens, not the hundreds', with aides saying it would be at the lower end of that range .","Sentinel joins two C-17 transport aircraft in West Africa .

The family of a soldier killed in the First World War have been reunited with his Victory medal - after it turned up in a sewer. Private Charles William Curtin was killed at . Ypres in May 1915, aged just 35, and the posthumous award for his bravery in . France was all his young family had left of him. But the bronze campaign medal went missing and was not seen for more than 70 years. Now the heirloom has been returned to Pte Curtin's grandchildren John Hodgson and Dorothy Heed, after it was found in a Manchester sewer by a labourer. Returned: John Hodgson with his grandfather's Victory medal after the bronze heirloom was found in a sewer . Tragic: Charles Curtin's medal was all his widow Anne, right, had left of him after he was killed in Ypres at 35 . Found: A worker found the rusting medal dumped outside a sewer at Hough End, Chorlton, 90 years later . The worker's sister-in-law, retired accountant Christine . Wolstenholme, spent three years tracking down the family so she could return the treasure to its rightful home. The 66-year-old's achievement is all the more impressive . because the medal had been engraved with a slightly wrong . name. Mr Hodgson, from Poulton, near . Blackpool said: 'The phone rang one day and this lady asked if I was . John Hodgson and did I have relatives in Chorlton called Curtin. 'She said a family member of hers had . been working in sewers in Manchester and had found a medal and she'd . spent some years since trying to track the rightful owners down. 'I was quite amazed really. Especially . as my cousin Anne had tried to trace where the medal had gone once. The . fact she spent all this time doing the research for strangers is just . amazing.' The 70-year-old - who has never seen the medal - said he had never known much about his grandfather. Brave: Pte Curtin received the bronze campaign medal posthumously after he was killed at Ypres in May 1915 . Pte Curtin signed up to the 2nd . Battalion, Royal Lancaster Regiment, aged just 16. He married Anne . Shelmerdine in 1909 when he was 26 and they settled in . Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester. After World War One broke out, he was posted to Ypres, and never returned to his wife and children. Records showed that he was killed in . action on Saturday, May 1, 1915, in the second battle of . Ypres, which claimed 100,000 lives. The couple had two daughters - Alice, who died in infancy and Mr Hodgson's mother Annie, who was just two years old when her father was killed. A death notice written by Anne was printed in the Manchester Evening News. It read: 'Oft we . pause and think of you and think of how you died. To think you could not . say goodbye befire you closed your eyes. Sadly missed by wife and . family.' Anne . remarried after the war in 1923, and she and her new husband William Dewhurst had a son called Wilfred. Anne died in her 60s in the 1940s. Bereaved: The death notice written by Anne and printed in the Manchester Evening News . Search: Christine Wolstenholme, whose relative found the medal, finally realised it was inscribed with an alias . Mr Hodgson, a retired television engineer, said: 'I have an old photograph of my father . before he set off to war - something all soldiers would do in case they . never returned. I suppose it's the same for soldiers fighting today. 'The sad thing is that he never saw my . mother grow up, the kids didn't have a father, and there are still tens . of thousands of children today not growing up with fathers because of . war.' The yellow bronze medal would have . originally hung on a ribbon with rainbow colours and was awarded to . all those who had served in the Armed Forces during the wartime. Mr Hodgson said: 'It doesn't look that . impressive now - it's a bit bashed up and tarnished - but it has . historical and sentimental value. 'It's just amazing to have it back - . it was so unexpected. The woman was so relieved she's found the right . family. 'The question that still remains is, how did it get into the . sewer? I suppose we'll never know.' The medal, inscribed with the words: 'The Great War for Civilisation', was found dumped in drains in Chorlton in 2007 by Mrs . Wolstenholme's brother-in-law. Memento: Mr Hodgson with a photograph of his grandfather. On the reverse is attached a handwritten verse that Private Curtin had copied from Rupert Brooke's famous poem The Soldier . The medal had regiment and number on the side but was . engraved with the name 'Pte C Williams', when the soldier's name was Charles William Curtin. The labourer . did nothing about the discovery for two years, when he handed a bag of lost items he had found to his relative. She decided to make it her mission to track down the heroic recipient's family. Mrs Wolstenholme, 66, from Wem, near Shrewsbury, Shropshire said: 'I knew it was going to be like finding a needle in a haystack, but I was determined to find out whose family the medal belonged and it was the right thing to do. 'It was a lot of work but well worth it and I'm so delighted the medal is back with its rightful owners. The project suffered a setback when she fell ill, but she picked it up again last year. Mrs Wolstenholme contacted the King's Own Royal Regiment Museum in Lancaster - since that was the regiment inscribed on the brass medal. 'They gave me some information about him that led me looking into old Manchester archives, but the files were useless - I now know it was because I was looking for the wrong name'. The turning point in her quest came after she contacted the National Army Museum in London, who told her his name was Charles William Curtin. The mother of two said: 'The woman told me it was very common for soldiers to go by another name, in case they were captured and for some reason that name was put on his medal.' With the correct name, Mrs Wolstenholme finally managed to track down two possible daughters of Mr Curtin. She said: 'I found two woman with the name Annie Curtin - one in Yorkshire and one in Blackpool, so I went with the latter. I looked up their children and hoped they weren't ex-directory in the phonebook. 'John was the fourth one down I called - and I burst with excitement when I found the right family. It has now spurred me on to research my own family tree.' She was also able to tell Mr Hodgson and his . sister that their grandfather's name was engraved on the war memorial statue in Ypres. The medal is now pride of place on the family mantelpiece.","Private Charles William Curtin was killed at .

A van driver was handed a £200 fine for not displaying a No Smoking sticker on his new vehicle four times more than if he'd been caught actually puffing at the wheel. Freddie Beasley, 28, from Cleankill Environmental Services had just picked up the brand new van  from a garage when he was pulled over in a joint police and council operation to clamp down on 'dodgy vehicles. Mr Beasley, who does not smoke, was warned that lighting up in company . vehicles was illegal and that he would have been fined £50 if he had . been caught taking a drag behind the wheel. Fuming: Company boss Paul Bates with the £200 fine handed to one of his drivers for not displaying a no smoking sign on a brand new vehicle . Clipboard-wielding . council officers then, however, spotted that he didn't had a 'no . smoking' sticker on his gleaming van and he was given an on-the-spot . fine of £200. Mr Beasley tried to explain that he had only just picked the new van up from a workshop where workers had painted the Cleankill logo on the side and that he was driving it back to the firm's HQ in Surrey. The law states that any 'company . vehicle' must have a no smoking sign - meaning that if he had been in . the van with no logo he wouldn't have been fined as it would have been . considered a 'personal van'. Yesterday Mr Beasley's boss Paul Bates said he was 'fuming' at the fine. He . said: 'Let this be a warning to anybody that drives a company van...we . have just been fined £200 for not displaying a no smoking sign in one of . our vans. Offence: Mr Beasley had failed to display a no-smoking sign in the brand new van . 'All our vans normally have them, but this was a new van we have only just had sign written, and was driven by somebody who doesn't smoke - but try explaining that to Haringey Council! 'The irony is that if our technician had been smoking he would have been fined four time less, just £50. 'There was no warning or caution - it is absolutely ridiculous and at a time when small business like ours are having a tough time financially.' The operation - run by Haringey Council, police and bailiffs - was called 'Operation Stop It' and was aimed at cracking down on 'unlicensed waste carriers' - fly-tippers - and other vehicles guilty of 'environmental crime'. Bosses at Haringey Council said that 95 vehicles were stopped outside the Wickes DIY store in Haringey last Friday. Among those stopped included six people driving vehicles in such a bad state they were seized by police, one man arrested for possessing drugs, one for stealing a disabled badge and several fly-tippers. They also doled out 12 £200 fines for not displaying 'no smoking signs' in company vehicles and two £50 fines to people caught smoking inside company vans. Cllr Nilgun Canver, Cabinet Member for the Environment at Haringey Council, said: 'We will continue to work closely with our partners in the police and the courts to tackle illegal activity around vehicles, especially looking out for unlicensed waste carriers that are responsible for so much dumping in our borough.

A shocking video showing the moment a naked Egyptian protestor was dragged across the ground and beaten by riot police has sparked outrage. Middle-aged Hamada Saber was stripped bare and coated in soot before he was pulled across the floor by a team of around six helmeted officers and attacked with truncheons. The brutal attack, which took place as police dragged Mr Hamada towards an armoured van close to the Presidential palace in Cairo was shown on television, to the horror of angry viewers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brutal: Egyptain police can be seen to attack Hamada Saber, illuminated by the green light of a protester's laser, after stripping him and dragging him into a police van . Shocking: Riot police wearing helmets pushed the middle-aged demonstrator to the floor before attacking him with truncheons . Vicious: The attack was shown on Egyptian television and came during clashes next to the presidential palace in Cairo . Today, Mr Saber lay in a police hospital as President Mohamed Mursi's office promised an investigation of the incident. The attack followed eight days of protests which have killed nearly 60 people, and has been called the deadliest wave of bloodshed of President Mursi's seven-month rule. His opponents say it proves that he has chosen to order a brutal crackdown like that carried out by Hosni Mubarak against the uprising that toppled him in 2011. 'Mursi has been stripped bare and has lost his legitimacy. Done,' tweeted Ahmed Maher, founder of the April 6 youth movement that helped launch the anti-Mubarak protests. Another protester was shot dead on . Friday and more than 100 were injured, many seriously, after running . battles between police and demonstrators who attacked the palace with . petrol bombs. That unrest . followed eight days of violence that saw dozens of protesters shot dead . in the Suez Canal city of Port Said and Mursi respond by declaring a . curfew and state of emergency there and in two other cities. Riot: An Egyptian armored riot police van of the Central Security Forces is lit up by laser pointers used by protesters during clashes in Cairo . Flames: Some of the tents of Egyptian protesters after an anti-government protest near the Ittihadeya presidential palace . But none of the bloodshed - which the authorities have blamed on the need for police to control violent crowds - has quite resonated like the images of police abusing a man at their feet - clearly helpless, prone and no possible threat. 'Stripping naked and dragging an Egyptian is a crime that shows the excessive violence of the security forces and the continuation of its repressive practices - a crime for which the president and his interior minister are responsible,' liberal politician Amr Hamzawy said on Twitter. The incident was an unmistakable reminder of the beating of a woman by riot police on Tahrir Square in December 2011. Images of her being dragged and stomped on - her black abaya cloak torn open to reveal her naked torso and blue bra - became a rallying symbol for the revolution and undermined the interim military rulers who held power between Mubarak's fall and Mursi's rise. The rise of Mursi - the first freely elected leader in Egypt's 5,000-year history - is probably the single most important change achieved by two years of revolts across the Arab world. But seven months since taking office, he has failed to unite Egyptians. Street unrest and political instability threaten to render the most populous Arab state ungovernable. Demonstrate: A Egyptian protester runs through clouds of smoke and tear gas during clashes with riot police . Protest: A demonstrator holds a smoke flare outside the Presidential Palace . The latest round of violence was triggered by the second anniversary of the uprising against Mubarak and death sentences handed down last week in Port Said over a soccer stadium riot. Mursi has had little opportunity to reform the police and security forces he inherited from Mubarak and the military men. But the police action against protests this time has been far deadlier than it was even a few months ago, when bigger crowds demonstrated against a new constitution. That suggests to opponents that Mursi has ordered a tougher response. 'The instructions of the interior minister to use excessive violence in confronting protesters does not seem like surprising behaviour given the clear incitement by prominent figures in the presidency, and leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood to which the president belongs, and other parties in solidarity with them,' said Khaled Daoud, spokesman for the opposition National Front. The liberal, leftist and secularist opposition accuses Mursi of betraying the revolution that toppled Mubarak by concentrating too much power in his own hands and those of his Muslim Brotherhood, a formerly underground Islamist movement. Tussle: Police and protesters scuffle as protesters try to break through a palace gate . Mursi and the Brotherhood accuse the opposition of stoking street unrest to further their demands for a national unity government as a way to retake power they lost at the ballot box. In announcing an investigation into the beating of Saber, Mursi's office made clear he was still pointing the blame at the political opponents who have encouraged protests. 'What has transpired over the past day is not political expression, but rather acts of criminality. The presidency will not tolerate vandalism or attacks on individuals and property. The police have responded to these actions in a restrained manner,' Mursi's office said. 'Doubtless, in the heat of the violence, there can be violations of civil liberties, and the presidency equally will not tolerate such abuses. In one incident, an individual was seen to be dragged and beaten by police. The Minister of Interior has, appropriately, announced an investigation.'

"The film was allegedly made on a 'shoestring' and starred former EastEnder Marc Bannerman and Andrea McLean from Loose Women . By . Tara Brady . PUBLISHED: . 15:24 EST, 29 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 29 January 2013 . A low-budget film starring Loose Women panellist Andrea McLean and former EastEnders star Marc Bannerman was only made to cover up a £2.5million tax scam, a court has heard. Bashar Al-Issa, 34, is alleged to have faked VAT receipts and film tax credits for a £19.6million gangster film called A Landscape of Lives that was never made. However, after the taxman caught up with the fraud in 2011, the former property developer and his co-conspirators cobbled together a low budget film called A Landscape of Lies to make the claims seem legitimate, it was said. Marc Bannerman, who played Gianni di Marco in EastEnders (left) and Andrea McLean (right) who presents Loose Women are believed to have starred in the film called A Landscape of Lies . The film was allegedly made on a 'shoestring' of £100,000 or less and starred Ms McLean as troubled bisexual therapist Dr Audrey Grey. Its IMDB listing also reveals that it starred former EastEnders actor Marc Bannerman. Al-Issa and co-defendants Tariq Hassan, 52, Ian Sherwood, 54, and Osama Albaghdady, 51, are accused of conspiracy to cheat the revenue between April 2010 and April 2011. They are accused of successfully claiming almost £800,000 in forged VAT receipts. They are also alleged to have tried to claim another £591,000, which was refused. During the second application for VAT repayments Hassan even claimed that A Landscape of Lives had backing in the form of a £19.6m loan, it was said. A further claim for £256,000 in film tax credits was also approved in March 2011, but a larger claim for more than £1m being handled by accountants Deloitte was rejected after the alleged fraudsters were arrested, jurors were told. The film is listed on IMDb as starring Andrea McLean and Marc Bannerman but none of the actors are involved in the alleged fraud . There is no suggestion that the actors in the film, including Andrea McLean, had any part in the alleged fraud. Opening the case at Southwark Crown Court, prosecutor Shane Collery told jurors: 'The film that was proposed to be made at that time was called A Landscape of Lives. 'It was a gangster film set in London. A Landscape of Lives was not made. A much rewritten and remade film called A Landscape of Lies was ultimately made in the beginning of June 2011.' Mr Collery continued: 'The impetus was probably that these defendants had been arrested in April 2011 and they needed to show they were going to make something. 'It was a very different film from that proposed to obtain government approval. A Landscape of Lives was a film said to have a budget of £19.6m. 'For A Landscape of Lies the budget was about £100,000. It was a much smaller budget. There were issues even about that. 'The film may have cost in the region of £84,000. A series of companies were set up to take part in this entire process. They were each involved in the production.' He said that initial claims of a film being made, in relation of A Landscape of Lives, were ‘a fiction intended to deceive’. Jurors heard how a company called Evolved Pictures Limited was initially in charge of A Landscape of Lives. Andrea McLean (far left), who presents ITV daytime programme Loose Women, is said to have starred in a film which she didn't know had been made to cover up an alleged tax scam . It has been alleged that Marc Bannerman (far left) who appeared in EastEnders, starred in a film which was only made to cover up a tax scam although there is is no suggestion he knew about the alleged fraud . Evolved in turn subcontracted the work to another company called AB Production Limited, said to have been run by Albaghdady. AB was then claimed to have subcontracted work to a third company called A-Z Consortium Unlimited, apparently run by a Jordanian man but which was in fact allegedly under the control of Al-Issa, who was declared bankrupt in March 2009. Co-conspirator Tariq Hassan, who was Al-Issa’s lecturer at the University of East London is said to have acted as bookkeeper. Sherwood, an architect, and engineer AlBaghdady, who Al-Issa knew from his property developing days in Manchester, are also accused of the same charge. The court heard how neither had any previous experience of working in the film industry.Explaining the alleged fraud further, Mr Collery said: 'Three production companies were set up as producers for the film. 'They had various links between them. On a commercial basis there was no reason for all three to exist. If you are making one film you do not need three production companies.' Referring to the allegedly fake VAT invoices submitted, Mr Collery continued: 'The Crown say that little at all was in fact supplied and that the invoices present a false picture. 'The whole purpose was to steal money from the public purse.' Iraqi-born Al-Issa, of Maida Vale, and Hassan of Loughton, Sherwood, 54, of Sale in Cheshire and Albaghdady, 51, of Crumpstall in Manchester all deny two counts of conspiracy to cheat the revenue between April 2010 and April 2011. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Bashar Al-Issa, 34, is alleged to have faked VAT receipts and film tax credits for a film that was never made .

A couple who had their car destroyed by an automatic rising bollard have finally won a four-year court battle for damages. Claire Savidge, 34, needed hospital treatment after her BMW M3 was hit from underneath by a bollard in Darlington, County Durham, in November 2008. The £20,000 sports car had to be written off by insurers after the device destroyed the engine. Faulty: This automatic bollard in Darlington, County Durham, rose from the ground five minutes before it should have done, causing extensive damage to a BMW belonging to Claire Savidge, 34 . Painful: Claire suffered an arm injury in the incident. She has successfully won damages against Darlington Council after CCTV proved the bollard rose from the ground too early . Claire and her husband Ashley accused Darlington Borough Council of arrogance in refusing to accept it had activated before it was supposed to, forcing them to pursue their claim through the courts. A judge sitting at Middlesbrough County Court found in the Savidges’ favour after CCTV images submitted by the council proved Mrs Savidge’s evidence that the bollard rose at 9.55am, not at 10am when it was meant to rise as the local authority claimed. The couple have been awarded compensation and costs but are waiting for a copy of the judge’s findings for the exact amounts. Darlington Borough Council said it is waiting for a copy of the judgement to read through the details of the finding, but that it had insurance in place to pay for court related costs. Pride and joy: Claire's BMW, which was worth £20,000, at the scene of the accident . Mr and Mrs Savidge are calling on the council to remove the offending bollard or make it safer . Mr and Mrs Savidge, of Darlington, said they feel vindicated by the judgement and called on the council to remove the rising bollard, which is still in place, or improve its safety. Mother-of-two Mrs Savidge said: 'I’m pleased  we’ve been successful and that we’ve won but I’m angry with the council for having something in place that’s so dangerous. 'It’s not safe and they need to do something about it. The council claimed the warning lights were flashing but the light is a couple of inches across and is to the side of the bollard. 'If you are going to put a warning light on something it should be in front of the driver like a level crossing – you shouldn’t have to turn your head away from the road.' Victory: The couple are delighted after they finally won their legal battle against the council after a four-year fight . Mr Savidge, 40, said the court case had taken so long because the council had refused to accept any blame for the incident. He said: 'The council dug its heels in and said it was Claire’s fault, that’s why they’ve gone to court. They honestly thought they were going to win. They gave evidence the car went through the bollard at 10am but their CCTV evidence proved us right. 'If they hadn’t used the CCTV stills with the time showing before 10am then it would have been harder for us to prove our case.' In a statement, Darlington Borough Council said: 'The court found in favour of Mrs Savidge. 'We are currently awaiting sight of the Court report from our insurers, who defended the case on our behalf, to read through the details of the case and the finding. 'We do have insurance in place to cover such court related costs.'","Claire and Ashley Savidge win case against Darlington Council .

Kian McMillan was just four months old when he died after a five-stone television fell on his head . A woman whose four-month-old son died when she knocked a five-stone television set on to his head while she was high on drink and drugs has been jailed for 15 months. Natalie McMillan, 25, put her 'self-indulgent drugs lifestyle' ahead of the welfare of her son, Kian, who died from 'catastrophic injuries', said the Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC. The baby was lying on his changing mat at the family home in Burnley, Lancashire, when the defendant attempted to move the TV to plug in a scart lead and watch a DVD. While giving evidence at her trial she tried to shift the blame to the boy’s father, her ex-partner Edward Hanratty, 41, and said she was upstairs in bed at the time. She denied she had been under the influence of drugs when her son died but tests later showed she had taken heroin and valium. Hanratty had also taken drink and drugs and had passed out on the kitchen floor at their address in Scarlett Street on December 6, 2011. Both pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of neglect during their trial at Preston Crown Court last month. McMillan, of Clarendon Road, Leeds, was cleared of manslaughter by gross negligence but Judge Russell said today that he was satisfied it was she who actually moved the television through 'foolishness'. Hanratty, of Dirkhill Road, Bradford, failed to attend for his sentencing and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Sentencing McMillan, the judge said: 'Over the short life of your child it is apparent that both you and your partner gave priority to your selfish and self-indulgent drugs lifestyle and neglected the welfare of Kian. 'On the night he died, both of you were so intoxicated by drugs and alcohol that you probably forgot all about him with the tragic consequence that he died.' Natalie McMillan (left) tried to shift the blame to the boy's father, her ex-partner Edward Hanratty (right), claiming she was upstairs when the TV fell on Kian who was just four months old when he died . The judge said it was clear that McMillan had been concealing the extent of her drug addiction from Social Services and health teams for a long time. She also hid her relationship with Hanratty, who was known to Social Services for previous welfare issues with other children. 'Had you revealed the true position, it is at least a possibility that steps would have been taken to address those issues and that Kian’s welfare might have been better safeguarded,' said Judge Russell. 'Quite remarkably in your evidence, which I have re-read, you never said you were sorry for what happened. In reality there is no mitigation in your case.' Peter Wright QC, defending, said: 'This has been a long road to recovery for this woman and it is indeed one that continues. 'There is the expression of remorse in the plea tendered. It was an expression which, we submit, was one of proper remorse when free of drugs and on mature reflection she recognised she had offended in this form and recognises she needs to be punished. 'This is a young woman who is emotionally detached. This emotional detachment may be long term by reason of her own life by what occurred in infancy and subsequently in adolescence.' He added McMillan had made 'considerable improvement' since descending to the 'depths of the spiral of drink and drugs' and could see a future for herself.","Baby Kian was lying on his changing mat at his family home in Burnley, Lancashire, when the TV fell on his head .

Jermain Defoe's hat-trick gave Tottenham fans even more to sing about after the Metropolitan Police reassured them they will NOT face prosecution for using the word 'Yid' in matchday chants. London's police force agreed with the club and their supporters that the 'Yid Army' songs are not anti-Semitic. Spurs fans often sing songs featuring the expression, and did so during their Europa League clash against Slovenian side Maribor at White Hart Lane, where a stunning treble from Defoe gave them a 3-1 win. Scroll down for video . Backing: Tottenham fans cheer on their side against Maribor on Thursday . 'The club does not tolerate any form of racist or abusive chanting. 'Our guiding principle in respect of . the ""Y-word"" is based on the point of law itself - the distinguishing . factor is the intent with which it is used ie if it is used with the . deliberate intention to cause offence. 'This has been the basis of . prosecutions of fans of other teams to date. Our fans adopted the chant . as a defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect . anti-Semitic abuse. They do not use the term to others to cause any . offence, they use it a chant amongst themselves. 'The club believes that real . anti-semitic abuse such as hissing to simulate the noise of gas chambers . is the real evil and the real offence. We believe this is the area that . requires a determined and concerted effort from all parties and where . we seek greater support to eradicate.' Before kick-off, a smattering of . supporters in the South Stand sang 'Yid Army' and, after a third-minute . corner for Spurs, the chant grew louder with the whole end joining in. Then, in clear protest at the . criticism levelled at them, Spurs fans from all corners bellowed: . 'We're Tottenham Hotspur, we'll sing what we want.' Another round of 'Yid Army' then followed. The club released a statement . defending their fans' right to use the expression.

'Our fans . adopted the chant as a defence mechanism in order to deflect . anti-Semitic abuse. They do not use the term to cause any offence, they . use it as a chant among themselves.'

The Society of Black Lawyers . threatened to report Spurs to the police if they were not seen to be . doing more to ensure the term is no longer used. Hat-trick hero: Jermain Defoe . As a youngster growing up supporting Spurs, it took me some time to realise the word 'yid' was an offensive racial slur. I'd never heard it used in a derogatory sense at White Hart Lane, only ever as a collective term - yid army - and as a positive identifier. If a player was good, he was a yiddo. But its significance soon became apparent. Though far from the abhorrent gas chamber hissing of some away fans, it's still sensitive. Context is important, though, and its reclamation as a positive term at the ground should not be ignored. The Society of Black lawyers says use of the word yid, including the tone adopted by Spurs fans, amounts to casual racism. Perhaps they have a point. Perhaps simply substituting the word would be the answer. But Spurs fans are unlikely to take kindly at being told what to do by an external body, especially as it is largely considered a positive, rather than offensive, chant. David Baddiel tried to stamp out its use by Tottenham supporters but, despite his own Jewish faith, the views of a Chelsea fan were never likely to be accepted by the Spurs majority. If the word yid really is to be kicked out of White Hart Lane, it would need concerns to be raised from within the Spurs-supporting community, rather than outside pressures.

Wayne Hitchcock threatened to blow up a block of flats but was stopped when the gas meter ran out of credit . Three men who threatened to blow up a block of flats were stopped thanks to a gas meter running out of credit. Police surrounded the block in Chaddesden, Derby, after drunken knifemen Wayne Hitchcock, Joseph Smith and Joseph Kilmartin took over one of the flats in the building. When police cordoned off the scene, Hitchcock and Smith went on a wrecking spree even ripping out a toilet and throwing it through a window along with parts of a settee and cupboards. They also ripped out a cooker which led to gas escaping before shouting 'we're going to blow this place up, we've turned the gas on'. Luckily, the gas meter had ran out credit and the pipe was damaged as the cooker was pulled out preventing the flat from being blown up. Jailing the three men for a total of seven years, Judge John Gosling said it was 'one of the worst' cases of public disorder he had dealt with in 30 years. One police officer described the incident as the 'most terrifying' experience in his nine years of service. Detective Constable Sean Grainger, investigating officer in the case, said: 'It was like there had been an explosion in the flat. 'These men destroyed the victim's life. They smashed everything in the flat and even threw the toilet out of the window. 'They broke all his worldly possessions, even items of sentimental value that are irreplaceable.'They were arrested after a one-and-a-half-hour stand-off with police. 'Some of the group were supposed to be friends with the victim but no real friend would ever cause a person so much hurt.' Kilmartin, who lived in the block, had been trusted to keep a key to the victim's home by a neighbour. Jailed: Joseph Kilmartin (left) and Joseph Smith (right) went on a rampage in the flat in an act described by a judge as one of the worst cases of public disorder he had ever seen . At 3.30am on May 20 Kilmartin let himself and his two friends, Hitchcock and Smith, into the flat. Officers were called to the block and discovered that a panel of the flat door had been damaged. 'They were drunk and aggressive and were all jeering and bouncing off each other,' said Mr Coupland. 'Smith was making gun motions with his fingers.' The police called for more officers and as they moved in to arrest the men, Hitchcock said 'come on, let's have it', and Smith screamed at officers to 'back off'. Hitchcock then threw a plant pot towards the police who had to spray CS gas to escape. Outside, officers looked on as items were thrown from the window. Smith, 20, and Hitchcock, 29, both from Chaddesden, admitted affray and criminal damage and were jailed for two years. Hitchcock was also convicted of another offence, racially aggravated threatening behaviour, and jailed for an extra five months. Kilmartin, 29, from Chaddesden, was convicted by a jury of affray and was jailed for three years. The flat tenant, who had been out at the time, told police that before the incident he had considered the three men to be friends and they had 'taken everything' from him because he had no home insurance. Derby Homes said they had found him another property and had repaired the flat at a cost of £1,500.","Wayne Hitchcock, Joseph Smith and Joseph Kilmartin destroyed the victim's flat before shouting 'we're going to blow this place up'

Britain is facing a growing exodus of its brightest workers who are leaving to work abroad, new figures show. As many as 3,599,000 people permanently left the UK between 2001 and 2011, of which 1,963,000 were aged between 25 and 44. Nick de Bois, secretary of the 1922 Committee of back-bench MPs, fears the 'brain drain' of Britain's educated will have a disastrous impact on the UK's economy. Mr de Bois, who is also Conservative MP for Enfield North, obtained the figures from the Office of National Statistics. He said: 'I have always felt the debate on immigration is ignoring the talented who are living in this country. 'The debate is often around the net immigration totals. But lost in the debate is the enormous damage being done to our economy by migration from the UK. 'Questions have to be asked as to why, even in a truly global economy where labour markets are relatively open, we here in the UK cannot hold onto our own home-grown, home-educated talent.' Within the last 10 years it is estimated 986 people left Britain every day. Research shows most people emigrating are graduates going to work for pharmaceutical, aerospace and engineering companies abroad. Mr de Bois called for a change of culture in Britain where competitiveness and success are valued and personal achievement and personal wealth are respected. He said: 'If we are losing talent to overseas pharmaceutical, aerospace, engineering and creative companies then surely we should be shaping policy to capitalise on the years of investment in and by these individuals. 'Certainly we must look to be introducing more competitive personal tax rates as a start, but not all are motivated by higher disposable income. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show how emigration among 25 to 44-year-olds peaked in 2008 . 'The language the Government uses will be as important as the policies it presents to compete with the lure of other countries who are attracting some of our country’s best home-grown talent.' Of the 3.6 million people who left the UK for a new life abroad, only 125,000 were of retirement age. Britons leaving the UK are most likely to be going to Australia, followed by the US and Spain. France, Germany, Canada and New Zealand are also popular destinations. Leaving: Britain's brightest workers are leaving the UK to apply their talent abroad, MP Nick de Bois has warned . A report by the Home Office last year found that rising house prices in the UK made emigration attractive to homeowners who were also entrepreneurs, because they could sell up and set up small businesses in expatriate communities. The UK has 4.7million expats living overseas, putting it eighth in the world for the number of its citizens living abroad. Emigration from the UK peaked in 2008 at around 427,000, according to the Home Office report.","Within the last 10 years it is estimated 986 people left Britain every day .

Cancellations have also taken place in Birmingham, Solihull and Dudley, with refuse lorries also struggling with ice-covered side roads - and councils have wheeled out a 'health and safety' excuse to explain why bin men cannot coolect  the overflowing rubbish. Mother-of-one Pat Robinson, from Kings Norton, said: 'It baffles me why binmen find it so difficult to complete their rounds when everyone else is getting their life back to normal.' But a message on Birmingham City Council's website defended the cancellations. It said: 'Even if the road has been gritted and is safe for vehicles, we also need to consider the safety of refuse collectors carrying heavy loads across slippery pathways and driveways as falls can be common.' The overflowing bin bags follow the furore at the start of January when council binmen made just one rubbish collection in eight weeks because of an EU law.

'Is it any wonder that, in this climate, Ramires of Chelsea believes he heard a white referee, Mark Clattenburg, refer to his black team-mate John Mikel Obi as a ‘monkey’ two weeks ago' Tottenham have issued an impassioned defence of their fans’ right to use the term ‘Yid’ in their matchday chants. Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, described the north London club’s attitude as being ‘40 years out of date’, and said that if such chants continue they would ask the police to bring a prosecution for racism. The society claim such chants — either by opposition fans or Spurs supporters themselves — are anti-Semitic and unacceptable in contemporary society. As part of a 10-point plan to tackle racism in football, they are threatening to report to the police any anti-Semitic chants heard at White Hart Lane unless Tottenham and the FA agree to take action.Spurs are steeped in Jewish tradition and large sections of their support refer to themselves as ‘Yids’ in matchday songs.

We believe this is the area that . requires a determined and concerted effort from all parties and where . we seek greater support to eradicate.' Herbert also says that ‘hissing’ noises made by away fans at White Hart Lane — a reference to the gas . chambers in the Holocaust — are equally intolerable and will also . provoke a complaint from his organisation. Herbert told Sportsmail: 'In discussions with members of the . Jewish community, we were made aware that this practice is still . continuing and it has to come to an end. 'If . neither Tottenham FC nor the FA are willing to take a stand then SBL . will report the matter to the Metropolitan Police Service for . investigation and, if necessary, prosecution.

After reading Tottenham’s statement, Herbert made a stinging attack on the club, branding the comments ‘unbelievable’. ‘The argument sounds like it is 40 . years old,’ he said. ‘I’m deeply saddened that a football club that . represents such a diverse area has taken such a view.

The Society of Black Lawyers is involved in talks to create a Black Players’ Association . with some professionals, claiming the football authorities are not doing . enough to represent them or to tackle racism in the sport. The PFA recently introduced its own six-point action plan but the society says this will prove 'ineffective'. Spurs supporters will be put under the microscope more than ever during the Europa League visit of Maribor. But Tottenham manager Andre . Villas-Boas is focusing on whether to field a double-pronged strikeforce . of Jermain Defoe and Emmanuel Adebayor against the Slovenian champions. England striker Defoe has been . Tottenham’s No 1 striker this season, while Adebayor has been forced to . spend most of the season on the bench. Villas-Boas said: ‘We have had thoughts, between the technical staff, about playing them both — about changing our structure. ‘We have had success in the past with . the system that we are playing. We certainly have played 4-4-2 in some . games when Ade has come on. But whether the right time is tomorrow I am . not sure.’ As a youngster growing up supporting Spurs, it took me some time to realise the word 'yid' was an offensive racial slur. I'd never heard it used in a derogatory sense at White Hart Lane, only ever as a collective term - yid army - and as a positive identifier. If a player was good, he was a yiddo. But its significance soon became apparent. Though far from the abhorrent gas chamber hissing of some away fans, it's still sensitive. Context is important, though, and its reclamation as a positive term at the ground should not be ignored. The Society of Black lawyers says use of the word yid, including the tone adopted by Spurs fans, amounts to casual racism. Perhaps they have a point. Perhaps simply substituting the word would be the answer. But Spurs fans are unlikely to take kindly at being told what to do by an external body, especially as it is largely considered a positive, rather than offensive, chant. David Baddiel tried to stamp out its use by Tottenham supporters but, despite his own Jewish faith, the views of a Chelsea fan were never likely to be accepted by the Spurs majority. If the word yid really is to be kicked out of White Hart Lane, it would need concerns to be raised from within the Spurs-supporting community, rather than outside pressures.

Tasteless: Kate Winslet stars in Movie 43, the first comedy produced by Sir Richard Branson's film studio Virgin Produced . Not since she dallied on the deck of the Titantic with Leonardo DiCaprio has Kate Winslet had a screen role so ill-fated. But while James Cameron’s 1997 blockbuster made the British actress a superstar, she must be hoping her latest film follows in the wake of the doomed ship, and sinks without trace. For Movie 43 — the first comedy produced by Sir Richard Branson’s film studio Virgin Produced — is a Hollywood movie so unremittingly awful that it had to be sneaked out on an unsuspecting public before critics could see it and warn them. But now that they’ve seen the final edit and reached for the tranquillisers (if not a revolver), it’s hard to imagine they would dream of encouraging anyone to actually see it. Even the famously publicity-hungry Sir Richard has gone suddenly quiet after hailing the film on his blog last week — then saying he hoped ‘the most outrageous comedy ever made … will put a smile on your face’. If only. Last year, Winslet, 37, saved Branson’s elderly mother from a house fire on his Caribbean island of Necker, and the actress recently married his nephew Ned RocknRoll. Branson has now rewarded the Oscar-winner by forever linking her with a film that tries to get laughs from a woman’s scatological sexual preferences, a teenager’s first menstruation, a woman who uses her breasts to stir guacamole, and a man whose testicles dangle from his throat. There’s more, but it’s not printable. As Hollywood shakes its head and wonders whatever possessed so many stars to get involved in such barrel-scraping sleaze, many of America’s top critics believe they may have witnessed  cinematic history. Quite simply, Movie 43 — now on general release in Britain — could be the worst film ever made. The reviews, which are far more entertaining than the actual film, don’t pull any punches. Respected U.S. critic Richard Roeper describes it as the ‘Citizen Kane of awful’. Most of his colleagues struggle to remember another film so dire. The ‘gross-out’ humour of defecation, perverted sex, cruelty and rampant political incorrectness isn’t even funny or original, they complain. But the general dismay at how low the standards of taste have sunk is matched by sheer bewilderment at how the film ever came to be made. As one New York critic put it: ‘Was someone holding Kate Winslet’s children hostage? Did Richard Gere or Hugh Jackman have gambling debts?’ Not funny: The film features 30 big-name stars, including Halle Berry (pictured in a scene from the film) but it's 'gross-out' humour has been panned by critics . Worst film ever? Director Peter Farrelly (right) has has told critics, who complain Hollywood never does anything new but 'flip out' when they get it, to 'lighten up' Comedy: Kate Bosworth and Richard Gere in a scene from Movie 43, which some believe may be the worst film ever made . If the cast had done it for the money, one might have understood. But insiders say it was produced on a shoestring, with its stars agreeing to be paid the union minimum rates of around $800 (around £500) a day. The entire film cost a lean $6 million (and amazingly recouped almost all that in its opening weekend in the U.S.). Its main director, Peter Farrelly, was responsible for the popular, if obscene, Nineties comedies Dumb & Dumber and There’s Something About Mary. Stung by the abuse about Movie 43, he has tweeted to critics: ‘You always complain that Hollywood never gives you new stuff, and then when you get it, you flip out. Lighten up.’ The ‘comedy’ — and the term has perhaps never been more loosely used — is composed of a dozen short films or sketches linked by a flimsy plotline. Jason Sudeikis and Justin Long star in a scene from the film, which is composed of a dozen short films or sketches linked together . I watched it in an almost empty New York cinema this week. The only other occupant walked out after ten minutes. The sketches that drove her away included the first, in which Winslet goes on a blind date with Hugh Jackman — star of Les Miserables and X-Men. Here he plays a successful lawyer whose only flaw is a pair of testicles hanging from his throat. Apparently, Winslet is the only person in the restaurant who notices anything amiss. The next skit continues in the same taste-free vein with A-list actress Naomi Watts and Golden Globe-nominated actor Liev Schreiber playing parents who home-school their teenage son. Determined to give him the full high-school experience, especially with sex, his father propositions him while his mother ends up French-kissing him. Later on, Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant — who wrote The Office with Ricky Gervais — go on a date in which they play truth or dare. Oscar-winning Berry ends up stirring guacamole with what’s clearly a prosthetic breast. Some of the sketches are even more disgusting. In one, a young woman wants her fiancé to do something unspeakable to her. In a second, actress Elizabeth Banks is drenched with cat urine from her boyfriend’s jealous pet, and ripped to pieces by children. Her fate is marginally better than the foul-mouthed leprechaun played by British action star Gerard Butler, who is tortured and murdered by two friends trying to get their hands on his pot of gold. So how did this glittering piece of movie-making history make it to the screen? Its producer, Charles Wessler, claims he came up with the idea 15 years ago. But various directors pulled out, and his actor of choice, George Clooney, refused point-blank to play a man unable to chat up women. But four years ago the film finally took flight when Wessler met Hugh Jackman at a wedding and he later agreed to do it. Astonishingly, Winslet also liked the script. The sketch featuring her and Jackman was then used to persuade a Hollywood studio, Relativity Media, to distribute the movie. And insiders say the producers and director called in a lot of favours from actor friends. Sir Richard Branson last week boasted on his blog how one of the producers overheard a businessman saying how he'd watched the trailer and never laughed so much in his life . The fact each role only took a few days to film helped their cause. And some of the ‘serious’ actors said they wanted to try their hand at risqué comedy any-way. In fact, director Farrelly insisted that all the stars ‘wanted to push it further’, although it is far from clear how they could have sunk even lower. The film took nearly four years to make because production had to fit in with the cast’s other filming commitments. The producers admitted the actors weren’t ‘completely aware’ of the other sketches, and few bothered to ask. ‘They were attracted to their script, and as long as that tickled their funnybone, that was enough,’ said co-producer John Penotti. TV personality Chelsea Handler (left) and the film's producer Charles Wessler (right) attend the premiere in Los Angeles . Friends of Winslet have defended her decision to take part, saying she spent only a few days filming it, and pointing out that she clearly wasn’t the only star who thought the script was funny. ‘Not everything turns out as well as it looks on the printed page,’ said one. Insiders insisted that she agreed to appear in the film before her romance began with Ned, whom she secretly married in New York. That aside, there are rumours in Hollywood that many of Movie 43’s stars are regretting their involvement. The thought of being associated with the most derided film in Hollywood history must be utterly galling. Last week, Sir Richard boasted on his blog how one of the producers overheard a businessman saying how he’d watched the trailer and never laughed so much in his life. ‘I think it’s a Virgin film, which makes total sense,’ this businessman apparently added. ‘That crazy Brit is taking over the world!’ One wonders whether Sir Richard feels so all-conquering now. Unless, of course, it was always the plan to add ‘world’s most unwatchable movie disaster’ to his list of achievements. Movie 43’s provocative tagline is: ‘Once you see it, you can’t unsee it.’ There’s a simple solution to that conundrum, and it’s one that a small army of humbled Hollywood stars are praying you take: don’t see it.","Movie 43 was released before critics could see the film and review it .

Don Marsh is accused of misusing company money to pay for hundreds for trips, while buying expensive gifts for friends and family and funding a series of mistresses . The former CEO of the Marsh Supermarkets chain appeared in federal court in Indianapolis on Monday to face allegations that he defrauded the company out of millions of dollars to fund his extravagant lifestyle. The lawsuit against Don Marsh accuses him of misusing company money to pay for hundreds for trips, including fishing jaunts to Alaska, while buying expensive gifts for friends and family and funding a series of mistresses. Marsh’s attorney told the nine-person jury that his client wasn’t perfect but had always acted in the best interests of the supermarket chain which has almost 100 branches, almost exclusively throughout Central Indiana. ‘Now, Don Marsh made some mistakes . along the way,’ said Andrew McNeil. ‘He had more than one extramarital . affair. He’s not perfect, but he gave his all to Marsh Supermarkets.’ In . court documents, the company has said that Marsh ‘treated Marsh . Supermarkets as his personal piggy bank,’ taking more than 350 . company-reimbursed trips from 1990 to 2006  which kept him out of the . office for six months of every year. The lawsuit claims Marsh used the company plane and funds to 'facilitate several extramarital relationships,' including one with a Russian ice-show director for whom the company paid for an apartment in New York, legal bills related to her immigration status and flights to Indianapolis to visit Marsh. Another mistress was the the company's director of community affairs, who the company then 'negotiated a resolution,' which involved her leaving the company. According to the lawsuit, the CEO often flew on the company jet ‘to take female employees on vague business trips to places such as Chicago or New York City’ and New Orleans, where he sometimes ‘spent significant amounts of money at various department stores.’ Launched by Marsh's father. the Marsh Supermarkets chain has almost 100 branches almost exclusively throughout Central Indiana . In 2005, Marsh flew two planeloads of family and friends to New York for the Macy¿s parade also at the company's expense . The CEO also attended what were called executive outings in Alaska that the lawsuit claims were fishing trips that involved few employees and cost $100,000 or more per outing. The company’s jet was also used by Marsh to visit his four vacation homes in Aspen, Col;  Saugatuck, Mich; the Dominican Republic and Naples in southern Italy. The lawsuit says the CEO also used company money to pay for his son's foreign travel in 2004 and 2005 to Africa and New Zealand at a total cost of $149,000. In 2005, Marsh flew two planeloads of family and friends to New York for the Macy’s parade also at the company's expense. The company also claims that Marsh bought expensive gifts for family and friends but passed them off as business expenses. On one occasion he spent $1,000 on two pairs of boots - one for a guide on a hunting trip, the other for the guide's girlfriend. ‘Mr. Marsh took what didn't belong to . him over and over and over,’ company attorney David Herzog said in his . opening statement to the jury. ‘He got caught and now he has to pay it . back.’ The company claims that Marsh took 'executive outings' in Alaska that were really fishing trips that involved few employees and cost $100,000 or more per trip . In 2006 Marsh sold the struggling supermarket chain for $88 million to the Florida-based asset management firm Sun Capital . Marsh, now 75-years-old and retired, is making a counter claim going against the company. He denies that he owes them compensation and is claims they owe him $2 million in withheld severance benefits, reports Indystar.com. In April 2006, Marsh organized the sale of the then struggling supermarket chain for $88 million to the Florida-based asset management firm Sun Capital. He resigned soon after. The supermarket chain was founded by Marsh’s father Ermal, who died in a plane crash in 1959. Don Marsh grew up in the company, he started bagging groceries as a boy and after his father’s death he joined the board and became its president in 1968 before he turned 30. During Marsh’s tenure running the company gained a reputation as an innovator and was one of the first to introduce computer-read customer loyalty cards. Marsh’s attorney suggested to the jury that his client’s innovative business approach explained why he had to travel so widely, including meeting world leaders Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi. During Marsh's tenure running the company it gained a reputation as an industry innovator and was one of the first to introduce computer-read customer loyalty cards . ‘He was able to wine and dine suppliers with heads of state... around the world,’ McNeil said. ‘He was not just sitting behind his desk on 96th Street in Indianapolis.’ He claims the company knew all along what Marsh was spending and is now attempting to change the rules. The company was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service for more than $5 million in improper deductions for executive expenses during Marsh’s time as CEO. The company settled with the IRS in 2011 by paying an undisclosed negligence penalty. The company has said it intends to ask for punitive damages against Don Marsh that could run as much as three times its compensatory claims of several million dollars. Marsh has described the suit an effort to smear and tarnish his reputation. The trial is expected to last two weeks if no out-of-court settlement is reached before then.","Don Marsh has been accused of misusing millions of dollars of company money during his tenure as CEO of Indiana-based Marsh Supermarkets .

If you think there’s something a little fishy about one of the  penguins in the picture below, you’re not wrong. Because the bird on the right isn’t a real penguin at all, but a hi-tech robot with camera lenses hidden in its eyes. Award-winning filmmaker John Downer used ‘Penguin-cams’ to infiltrate colonies of Rockhoppper and Emperor penguins in Antarctica – and obtain stunning shots of never-before-seen behaviour. Scroll down for video . The Penguin cam: A real Rockhopper penguin checks out one of the mechanical imposters which are self-powered with cameras in their eyes . Despite drawing a few quizzical looks, . the so-called ‘Penguin-cam’, which has camera lenses in its eyes, was . able to waddle in and mingle with the real birds. It was also used to ‘lay’ an ‘Egg-cam’, . which successfully captured charming images of a six-week-old chick . peering into it through natural curiosity. Mr Downer used an array of 50 spy cameras, the most advanced of which cost up to £100,000, to film penguins in Antarctica, the Falkland Islands and Peru. They included an ‘Egg-cam’, an underwater ‘Penguin-cam’ and a ‘Toboggan-cam’, a full-sized Emperor model which can join a group of real birds by slithering in on its stomach – in fact a motorised sledge. Mr Downer said: ‘We also employed an . underwater ‘Penguin-cam’ so that we could follow these amazing creatures . in their mission to find a safe place to nest and raise the chicks. ‘In Antarctica, the emperors brave treacherous sea ice and a trek across . the ice of up to 100 miles before huddling together to survive 90mph . winter blizzards. We were with them all the way. ‘In some of the most moving scenes, we filmed the plight of females who . had failed to find a mate or had lost their eggs. 'We witnessed single . females doing their best to break up couples by physically disrupting . them during mating. Later, alone and without young of their own, they . would resort to chick-napping. ‘We also recorded evidence of the devotion of penguin pairs who had . matched and mated. And extraordinary close-ups that showed how emperor . mothers flick their tail feathers to catch the newly laid egg and stop . it touching the snow.’ John Downer's toboggan-cam': a fake emperor penguin that is self-powered and slithers into midst of colony . ‘In the 35 years I have been making wildlife films I have never seen or captured so much extraordinary new behaviour on any animal. We have never got closer to any subject.' Mr Downer has previously used . ‘Boulder-cams’ hidden in mock rocks to film lions, ‘Plop-cams’ disguised . as jumbo dung to film elephants, ‘Tusk-cams’ attached to Indian . elephants to film tigers and an ‘Iceberg-cam’ to follow polar bears . through the drifting Arctic ice floes. There were casualties among the robots, however. Three ‘Egg-cams’ vanished in a blizzard. A ‘Penguin-cam’ was attacked by a rockhopper and . had its head taken off. In Peru, an underwater ‘Penguin-cam’ was attacked by sealions that bit off a flipper. His team filmed 1,000 hours of intimate behaviour over 300 consecutive days, the longest ever shoot of emperors ever made . Producer Phil Dalton said: ‘The animatronic devices we used might appear . quirky, cute or sometimes comical but they had a real purpose. ‘We used the very latest robotic technology to mimic the birds’ behaviour, helping us to fit right into penguin life. ‘In Peru, for instance, the penguins are super-nervous of humans. If . they spot you from 100 metres away they panic and run. But our . Penguin-cam was able to infiltrate the colony without ruffling a . feather. ‘All our different spy cameras enabled us to get closer to the penguin . families than ever before and to capture behaviour never seen before.

A man has received nearly 300 phone calls after his number was broadcast on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz of the Year. The comedian Jack Whitehall wrote down the number on the panel show, telling viewers it belonged to fellow panellist Jonathan Ross, and urged the audience to 'call him whenever you want'. But the number belonged to Rakesh Sagar, a picture researcher, who has now received nearly 300 calls after the broadcaster allowed the number to be viewed. The number was shown on the Big Fat Quiz after Whitehall scrawled it down and claimed it belonged to Jonathan Ross . A row has been brewing after Jack Whitehall and James Corden made a raft of vulgar jokes . Whitehall, 24, had made up the combination, which had too many digits on it to be genuine, and Channel 4 broadcast it - although they claim it was partially obscured and only shown briefly. But as the extra digits came at the end of Mr Sagar's number, it meant people automatically dialled him, despite them typing the full combination. Mr Sagar, 27, from London, has . complained to Ofcom and is now taking legal advice over what further . steps he can take, the Daily Telegraph reported. Whitehall was spotted today as the furore over the show grew . Channel 4 has apologised to Mr Sagar, who says he does not want to change his number as he had paid for one that was 'easy to remember'. But the broadcaster insisted viewers must have 'guessed' the number because it was partially obscured on screen. The show had already resulted in more . than 160 complaints to Ofcom and Channel 4 because of offensive and . vulgar jokes made about the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Susan Boyle, . Usain Bolt and Barack Obama. The programme was broadcast on . December 30 and immediately afterwards Mr Sagar, who had not watched the . show, began getting calls from people who hated Jonathan Ross and . wanted to shout abuse, or people who thought they were calling . Whitehall. Mr Sagar told the Daily Telegraph: 'I didn’t even bother going to work on Monday because I knew my phone wouldn’t stop ringing and I couldn’t switch it off because a relative is ill and I needed to be contactable.' A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'An illegible and non-functional number which contained more digits than a standard mobile number was shown very briefly on the contestant’s panel on Big Fat Quiz of the Year,' the newspaper reported. 'Whilst it was obscured and only shown briefly, some viewers have attempted to guess the number and this appears to have led to calls being made to this phone. 'We have apologised and have further obscured the digits on repeats of the show.' Ofcom is 'assessing the complaints' but is yet to launch an investigation, a spokesman said. Halfway through the two-hour show . Corden took a bottle of red wine and two glasses from beneath his desk . and poured himself and Whitehall a drink, then started eating pizza. The pair were soon appeared to be drunk and Corden was slurring his words. He then started to make crude comments about Britain’s Got Talent star Susan Boyle.Corden . and Whitehall continued to drink more and host Carr later pointed out . that the pair had drunk a bottle of wine each. Afterwards Whitehall told . his Twitter followers: 'We got so drunk.' Viewers took to Twitter and television forums to vent their dismay even as the programme was being broadcast. The Big Fat Quiz of 2012 was far from unusual among programmes billed as 'light entertainment', in the way it revelled in lewd, humiliating jokes . Whitehall comes from a privileged background. His father is Michael Whitehall, 72, a former theatrical agent turned producer. His clients over the years have included Judi Dench, Colin Firth, Richard E. Grant, ­Daniel Day-Lewis and Edward Fox.

"By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 06:28 EST, 30 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:29 EST, 30 January 2013 . Professor Stephen Hawking has sparked new health fears by pulling out of a trip to Ecuador. The renowned cosmologist was due to speak at a conference in the Pacific city of Guayaquil on February 6. He informed authorities he would not be able to attend over the weekend, citing health reasons. The most recent picture of Professor Stephen Hawking show him trying out a new speech system. It was confirmed today he has pulled out of a trip to Ecuador on medical advice . The 71-year-old, diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21, missed two birthday parties last year because of health problems. A spokesman said last night he had suspended his trip to Ecuador on medical advice but insisted it was nothing 'too serious.' Hawking said he expects to visit 'in the near future,' according to reports. The physicist had been invited by the Ecuadorian Vice President Lenin Moreno during a visit he paid to London in August 2012. Moreno, currently in charge of the Presidency, wished him a speedy recovery. Many experts say Professor Hawking has defied medical science by reaching the age of 71 as his degenerative illness usually proves fatal within five years of diagnosis. Professor Hawking has become as much a celebrity as he is a scientist, . appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons, starring in Star Trek and . providing narration for a British Telecom commercial that was later . sampled on a Pink Floyd album. He also starred in the 2012 Paralympic opening ceremony, and in a TV ad for an insurance firm. However, his condition worsened recently, causing him to struggle to communicate. The world renowned physicist has for the past ten years composed his sentences one letter at a time using a twitch of his cheek to stop a cursor as it moves across an on-screen keyboard. Professor Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21. Motor neurone disease (MND) attacks the nervous system and leaves . muscles damaged, causing loss of mobility and difficulties with speech, . swallowing and breathing. One in 50,000 people are diagnosed . with the disease each year and sufferers usually die within five years . of its onset. Its cause is a mystery but some experts believe an . individual's damaged genetic make-up might be a contributory factor. There is currently no cure. Stephen Hawking, who is confined to a wheelchair, is the world's . best known sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - . amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He . is an exceptional case, having survived for more than 40 years, despite . doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed. After he painstakingly crafts his sentences one word at a time, a computer attached to his wheelchair reads them out in the distinctive metallic voice for which he is known. But recently the disease from which he suffers has made his cheek twitch more difficult to control, significantly slowing the rate at which one of the world's sharpest minds is able to communicate with the outside world. To help, computer hardware firm Intel recently announced it was giving him a device it hopes will help the professor compose up to ten words a minute. The world-renowned physicist has used a computerised speech generator for years, composing sentences one letter at a time using a twitch of his cheek. His worsening physical condition has left him able to manage around just one word a minute. Intel began working on Professor Hawking's new device in 2011, after he asked for help from Intel co-founder Gordon Moore - the man behind computing's famous 'Moore's Law', which says processing power will double every two years. The new system uses facial recognition technology to recognise not only Hawking's cheek movements, but also twitches from his mouth and eyebrows to send words to a new speech machine. Justin Rattner, Intel’s chief technology officer, told Scientific American magazine that the upgrade comes after technology finally caught up with the complicated concepts Hawking wanted to express. 'We’ve built a new, character-driven interface in modern terms that includes a better word predictor,' he said. 'Up to now, [previous] technologies didn’t work well enough to satisfy someone like Stephen, who wants to produce a lot of information.' Professor Stephen Hawking speaks during the Opening Ceremony for the 2012 Paralympics in London . The new technology offers the . professor the opportunity to use two different signals to express . himself, which means he could even communicate using Morse code which, . said Mr Rattner, 'would be a great improvement'. Professor . Hawking took to his personal blog to tell how grateful he is for the . new technology that allows him to continue to speak. 'One’s voice is very important,' he wrote. 'If you have a slurred voice, people are likely to treat you as mentally deficient. 'This [computer] synthesiser is by far the best I have heard, because it varies the intonation, and doesn’t speak like a Dalek. 'The only trouble is that it gives me an American accent.' Intel has worked with Professor Hawking since the late Nineties to provide the technology he needs to express himself. In the 1970s, already confined to a wheelchair, he produced a stream of first class research, including probably his most important contribution to cosmology. This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing. By applying quantum mechanics to black holes, he had taken the first steps to combining quantum theory and general relativity. One describes the universe at the sub-atomic level, and the other at very large scales. Bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals of modern physics. In the 1980s, Prof Hawking and Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time. The concept was described in A Brief History Of Time, which sold 25 million copies worldwide.","Cosmologist was due to visit Guayaquil to speak at conference .

A father who had three fingers ripped off in a road accident is keen to get back on his motorbike after having his digits replaced by his toes. Bike racer Jonas Barber, 31, underwent a 12-hour operation . where two of his toes were removed to compensate for the fingers he lost on his right hand. The father-of-three from Leeds will soon undergo . another operation to remove scar tissue but said he was delighted to get his grip back. You've got to hand it to him: Jonas Barber lost three fingers on his right hand. He had his middle and ring finger replaced using the toe next to his big toe from each foot . Best foot forward: Mr Barber still has good foot function despite having the digit from next to each big toe removed . He said: 'I was willing to do anything to get back on the bike. But it has also meant I can do all kinds of day-to-day things like hold a laptop or grab a pint. 'They aren't the prettiest of things but I don't really care. All that matters is that I have some function back.' The auto-electrics expert, who runs his own business, was injured during a race in Lincolnshire in July 2011. He was clipped by another rider travelling around 80mph and his fingers got caught in the brake disc of his bike. The hardy racer said he calmly picked up his fingers off the track and waited for help. 'The marshal came and nearly fainted looking at my hand,' he said. 'There wasn't much pain. I was more in discomfort from a dislocated shoulder.' Doctors attempted to reattach his index finger in hospital, but had to remove it again after it refused to take even with treatment with leeches. Then that November he was told about a possible toe transplant and he went under the knife at the Spire Hospital in March 2012. Mr Barber pictured on the day of the accident with his daughter Freya. He told her his fingers would grow back . Mr Barber lost three fingers (left) in the smash. He now has two toes acting as replacements (right) Mr Barber said: 'To start with their wasn't . much pain but as the recovery goes on the more the nerves knit and the . more pain you get because you are getting more sensation. 'When . the bandages come off you still recognise them as your toes and they . are never really going to look like your fingers, although a lot of . people do comment how well it looks. 'I'm still self-conscious with it but we have done it for function, that's the main objective.' A toe transplant is a potential treatment for someone who has a number of fingers missing. The most commonly transplanted toe is the second toe as it is the longest and has joints, a nail, sensitive pulp tissue and a reliable blood supply. The foot is repaired  by closing the gap between the third and the big toe, leaving a scar. One second toe can be taken from each foot with very little effect on the function and appearance of it. When each toe is transferred its blood vessels must be successfully joined to similar vessels in the hand for it to survive. This part of the operation is performed under an operating microscope. Tendons (to allow movement where required) and nerves (to allow feeling) and the bone must also be rejoined to their counterparts in the hand. The bone is usually held together with fine pins while it heals. These are usually withdrawn 3-6 weeks after the op. After the transplant the arm is immobilised with a plaster splint. This is left for three weeks before the dressing is changed. Feeling gradually returns to the nerves over around 12 weeks, often creating a pins-and-needles sensation. After this the splint can be worn less and less. Stretches help the joints to recover. SOURCE: www.plastic-surg.co.uk . He added that his wife Carla and three daughters Amelia, eight, Madison, six and Freya, four, were all happy with his new hand. 'Now . with the new fingers I can hold a pint glass properly, which is great. Little things like that are taken for granted but I can enjoy a drink, . hold a laptop without dropping it, hold a bottle,' he said. 'My . feet were fine as well. It wasn't just the toe but they cut into the . foot they needed skin for my hand. The feet been narrowed in effect. 'Racing is a real passion for me and now with the transplant that is the goal. I would like to be track daying by the start of next year.' He was treated by Prof Simon Kay, who carried out the UK's first hand transplant on Mark Cahill in December. Prof . Kay, seen as a pioneer in his field, used the toe next to the big toe . from each of Jonas' feet, providing him with large enough digit . substitutes without causing him problems with balance. The professor usually carries out the procedure on babies and very young children and says adult patients are very rare. He said: 'People think that if you're operating on youngsters it's more tricky because they're small.  But it's not, if anything it's more difficult working with the size of an adult's body.' In the case of Jonas he was a great patient because he has the right personality - he doesn't want to be dramatic or make a big fuss, he just wants to sort himself out and get on with his life.The procedure involves re-attaching the bone, nerves, arteries, tendons, ligaments and skin of the toe to the hand. However, Prof Kay said: 'It wasn't really complicated surgery. For me and my amazing team, it was relatively straight-forward. 'The operation gives you some feeling, some movement, some power. We aren't trying to create something beautiful, we're trying to create something functional.' Mr Barber said his children were particularly relieved by the outcome. 'When I first had the accident we . initially told my youngest daughter my fingers would grow back,' he said. 'Since . I've had the toes sewn onto my hand she thinks that's exactly what . happened - and we aren't about to tell her any different.' Mr Barber (right) racing his motorbike on the day of the accident.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 08:20 EST, 1 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:56 EST, 1 February 2013 . A baby girl nearly died after she was born with a tumour crushing her windpipe. Doctors had to race to save  Isabel Roberts' life by creating an airway so she can breathe. The tumour weighed 0.6lb - a sixth of her 3lb 9oz weight when she was born. Had she not been born by  Caesarean section, she would have been unable to breathe because the tumour was pressing down so hard on her airway. And the pioneering operation she had to remove it is a UK first, doctors say. Isabel was born after her twin sister  Alexandra, who arrived without any problems. Isabel Roberts (left) with mother Maureen and twin sister Alexandra. Isabel was born with a cancerous tumour the size of an orange on her neck, which left her struggling to breathe . But the surgical team from Sheffield Children's Hospital and Sheffield's Jessops maternity hospital were faced with a much more complex situation with Isabel. They had to free her head from the uterus, allowing her to continue getting oxygen from the umbilical cord as they fitted a tube down her constricted throat to enable her to start breathing normally. Dr Ayman Eissa, the consultant . anaesthetist at Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust who found and . secured Isabel's airway during the 'exit procedure', said: 'As soon as . the baby's head was out of the uterus it was a race against time. 'We estimate the placenta will . continue to supply oxygen through the cord for up to five minutes, but . you can never be sure, it could break off at any time. 'The baby was so small and the tumour . so big, it was a very difficult job to secure the airway. The relief . when I secured the tube was unimaginable. It was definitely the most . stressful few minutes of my career.' Isabel's mother Maureen, from Hoyland, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said they found out she had an abnormal mass at an ultrasound scan 33 weeks into the pregnancy. She said: 'The few weeks leading . up to and after the twins' arrival were a blur, it's crazy to think . just how much has happened to my baby. I can remember walking into the . operating theatre to have the caesarean and not knowing what was going . to have happened when I woke up.' When doctors weighed the tumour, they found it accounted for a sixth of Isabel's body weight. She is now responding well to treatment . The orange-sized tumour was removed 10 days after the twins was born and specialists believe Isabel has every chance of making a full recovery. The twins, who are now 16 weeks old, are now back home with their parents and older sisters Sarah, 16, and Olivia, 11. Neil Bateman, the consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon, who removed Isabel's tumour said: 'The tumour was sitting right on the trachea and was very close to her major arteries. 'It was tricky to remove, but I managed to get it all. 'When we weighed the tumour it accounted for one sixth of her entire body weight. It is very rare for a baby to develop a tumour of this size in the womb.' Tests showed the tumour was cancerous and Isabel was put on a course of chemotherapy at the Children's Hospital after her birth, which is continuing. Mr Roberts said: 'Isabel looked so much better after Mr Bateman removed the tumour. Her head was not forced back anymore, she looked like a normal baby. 'Then we found out she had cancer, it was unbelievable.' But Dr Anna Jenkins, who is treating Isabel, said she should recover fully. She said: 'It is very rare for a baby to be born with such a large cancerous tumour. 'She is coping well with treatment. The cancer hasn't spread and we are expecting her to make a full recovery.' Mrs Roberts said: 'I was really nervous going home for the first time without the support of the nurses, but it was also such a relief and meant Isabel was getting better and we could be a family. 'We only have to go to the hospital every three weeks for chemotherapy at the moment, and she's getting stronger every day.'","Isabel Roberts born with tumour on neck that weighed a sixth of her weight .
