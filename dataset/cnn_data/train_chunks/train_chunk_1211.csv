"A 12-year-old girl was killed by her younger sibling in an accidental shooting just hours after she spoke about her love and thankfulness for her family at a church service. The schoolgirl, identified by friends as Adelaide Clinger, had given a Thanksgiving-themed speech about her gratitude and love for family to fellow members of her Mormon church. That afternoon emergency services were called to the Clinger's family home in Kaysville, Utah, where they immediately attempted life-saving measures on the girl but said she 'eventually succumbed to her injuries'. Adelaide's neighbor Morgan Mojica said the last thing the girl said in church is that she loves her family . 'She spoke in church today,' Adelaide's friend and neighbor Morgan Mojica told KUTV. 'The last thing she said is that she loves her family.' 'She was my best friend and I loved her so much,' the victim's 13-year-old friend Sydney Arveseth added. 'I don't know how I'm going to get through this.' Jill Bowden, a neighbor who attended the same church as the Clinger family, told the Deseret News: 'She was saying how grateful she was for her family and how her friends and her mom and dad are the best things in her life.' Officials said the victim attended Centennial Junior High School, which will have grief counselors on hand  for students who may be affected by the death. Police have released few details about the shooting and noting the investigation is in its early stages, but they said they are not looking for any suspects. Emergency services were called to the Clinger's family home in Kaysville, Utah, where they immediately attempted life-saving measures on the girl but said she 'eventually succumbed to her injuries' Lieutenant Paul Thompson noted that handling incidents of this nature is difficult for officers, particularly those who have children of their own. 'It's certainly not easy for anybody involved in these sorts of calls,' he said. Lt. Thompson added that such events offer a tragic reminder that firearms need to be securely stored in homes. He said 'at minimum a trigger lock, but at a maximum a safe is certainly best'. A tweet from the Davis County Health Department Sunday night said: 'We urge all families to lock up firearms and discuss gun safety with children.'","Adelaide Clinger died in accidental shooting at her home in Kaysville, Utah .

When Stormwater Supervisor Brooks McCarty and Animal Control Officer Kathy MacKenzie arrived at the scene they came up with the idea of using dish soap to get it out. 'We soaped his head up and pulled and pulled and twisted,' McCarty told MetroWest Daily News. 'All of a sudden he just popped out and she let him go and he stood there confused and then just ran up into a tree.'

"In the Harry Potter books, the magical Marauder’s Map reveals the whereabouts of characters as they roam the halls and classrooms of Hogwarts school. And now a team of engineers has created technology that has the potential to work in the same way, but for any building around the globe. Called SiRFusion, the software combines Wi-Fi signals, GPS, and phone sensors to map indoor locations such as shopping malls, help people find items in supermarkets and even track people in a crowd. The SiRFusion software, from Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR), helps app developers map indoor locations.  It combines real-time Wi-Fi signals, GPS and sensors in phones to calculate accurate points, which could help people navigate shopping centres, find items in supermarkets and locate people in crowds . It was created by Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR), and can be added to any Android app. GPS systems typically rely on having a good line-of-sight to the sky and the satellites that provide it with its positioning information. And while these systems do work, to an extent, indoors, the accuracy and reliability is poor because walls and roofs block this view. Once installed onto an app, CSR’s software begins by checking GPS, it then combines this with real-time Wi-Fi signals. These signals reveal the location of routers, for example, and the distances that devices are away from signal hubs. It then uses what’s known as pedestrian dead reckoning. This uses motion sensors and compasses built into devices to determine not only the person’s location, but also plot their movements. This is based on the speed they are walking for example, and the angle they're travelling. This information is ultimately uploaded to CSR’s cloud-based Positioning Centre to calculate an accurate indoor location. CSR claims the technology is accurate to around 16ft (five metres) for a busy location, but this accuracy is improved depending on the number of Wi-Fi signals, for example. Once a developer adds the software to their app, CSR begins by checking GPS and then combines this with real-time Wi-Fi signals. These signals reveal the location of routers, for example, around a building, as well as the distances that devices are away from these signal hubs. It then uses what’s known as pedestrian dead reckoning. This involves using motion sensors and compasses built into devices to determine not only the person’s location, but also plot their movements based on the speed they are walking for example, and the angle they are travelling in. This information is ultimately uploaded to CSR’s cloud-based Positioning Centre to calculate an accurate indoor location. CSR claims the technology is accurate to around 16ft (five metres) for a busy location, such as a shopping centre, but this accuracy can be improved depending on the number of Wi-Fi signals, for example. ‘It’s a useful technology for public venues, hotels and shopping malls, enabling people to quickly find their way to the destination,’ said Dave Huntingford, director of product line for location. ‘An example use case is an airport; using this technology in an airline application would allow the airline to offer guidance through the airport, indicate how long it will take to walk to the gate from their current location, notify gate changes with maps and what documentation they need in hand as people walk towards security. The Marauder's Map (pictured) is a fictional map of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as featured in the Harry Potter franchise. It tracks the location of every person in the grounds, shown as footprints labelled with the person's name (pictured) CSR told MailOnline the uses of the software are determined by the app, meaning it has the potential to track individual people - but only where the developers and users allow. For example, the technology could be used by a dating app to track nearby singles, or a parent could use it to track their child in a crowd . ‘It would [also] allow the airline to understand where their passengers spend time at the airport or get lost.’ CSR told MailOnline that the uses of the software are determined by the app, meaning it has the potential to track individual people - but only where the developers and users allow. For example, the technology could be used by a dating app to track nearby singles, or a parent could use it to track their child in a crowd. It could additionally be used to target people with specific adverts or promotions. The users need to grant permission for any app running the software to be able to do this, and none of the user’s information is shared with CSR.","The SiRFusion software helps app developers map indoor locations .

"The North Korean government may deny their existence, but photos taken from space have revealed in unprecedented detail the concentration camps that are used imprison more than 200,000 citizens. Men, women and children are forced to work seven days a week as slaves and eat 'rats, frogs, snakes, insects' and even faeces to battle starvation in the camps. Previously there have been blurred images taken by satellite but new detailed pictures from South Korea's Unification Ministry allow a closer look at the sites - and also prove they have grown. Experts say the tens of thousands of prisoners at the camps are often taken from their homes or in the street for supposed 'political crimes' rather than actual misdemeanours. Closed off: Close to its border with China, the camp in Hwasong in North Hamkyong Province, has never been seen in so much detail . Secluded: Surrounded by snow this camp in Bukchang, South Pyongan Province, is where many prisoners will die in complete squalor after working as slaves . Half of all the inmates will . die of starvation or malnutrition with others dying because of fatal . diseases that thrive in the squalid conditions. This . is if they are not killed by torture, firing squad, or a public stoning . by Kim Jong-Il's violent guards, former prisoners say. One of the photos shows the Yodok camp, which holds an estimated 50,000 North Korean prisoners and is hidden in the mountains around 70 miles from the capital Pyongyang. Kang was only nine years old when he and his family were sent there for political crimes. 'We had no food. We eat anything we could get our hands on -- rats, snakes, frogs, insects,' he told CBN news. 'We just had to find a way to survive.' 'Even though it happened a long time ago when I look at the satellite pictures I can still remember everything I saw and endured,' he said. 'The camp definitely looks bigger. For example, new buildings for prison guards weren't there before. I can only assume that means there are more prisoners being held and therefore more security is needed.' Kang spent 10 years in Yodok before escaping to China in 1992 and wrote about his experiences in the book The Aquariums of Pyongyang. Secret: Photos of the camp, only know as 22, were taken after finding their locations on Google . Undeniable proof of existence: These satellite photos are of the North Korean prison camp Yoduk. The images show the camp in detail (top left) and then slowly zoom away to show its location in the country (bottom right) It is believed he is the first prisoner to reveal to the world the existence of Yodok. 'The thing I remember the most about in the camp is how the prison guards would kill people for no reason. I witnessed many people being executed,' he said. Amnesty International has compared the satellite images to those taken 10 years ago and confirms they are growing in size and branded them 'hellish'. 'The outside world certainly doesn't know what's going on and very little from the inside comes out,' Sam Zarifi, from Amnesty International said last month. Deadly: Kim Jong Il's North Korea deny the existence of any camps, but this image of camp No. 14 in Kaechon, South Pyongan Province, shows clearly buildings and a large open yard . 'The very little that has come out paints a very disturbing picture.' Scott Edwards, director of the science and human rights program at Amnesty International added: 'The fact that we would have to rely on satellite imagery just to dispel the government's assertion that these camps don't exist is testament really to the scale of the human travesty that might be going on inside.' The news came as it was revealed the South Korean government will send a group of religious leaders and representatives to visit North Korea tomorrow on a peace mission. The Unification Ministry says delegates from the Korean Conference on Religion and Peace will leave for Pyongyang on Wednesday, where they will discuss peace and human rights issues. It is also understood they could meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.","More than 200,000 men, women and children are held in the camps .

"A child porn suspect who allegedly enrolled his 17-year-old accomplice in elementary school to lure victims was investigated two years ago following an incident at an aquarium, it was revealed on Monday. Randy Wesson, 28, was suspended from his job as an 'education associate' at Sea Life Aquarium in Grapevine, Texas after he allegedly tried to pick up a four-year-old boy and offered his services for babysitting to the child's mother. The woman, from Arlington, wrote to the aquarium's management to complain about the employee's behavior in February 2012. Scroll down for video . Randy Ray Wesson, 28, (left)  was arrested on charges of possession with intent to promote child pornography along with 17-year-old Ricardo Javid Lugo (right) who allegedly posed as a sixth grader . According to a police report seen by MailOnline, Wesson gave the mother his card and said that he was also available as a babysitter, saying he had experience having worked with Christian youth ministries. The woman, who was not identified, wrote: 'In my head, all I heard was, ''I want to molest your son, and groom him with Christianity and aquatic sea life.''' Wesson was suspended and then resigned the next day, police reported. Following an investigation, police were unable to arrest Wesson because there was no evidence of a crime and the case was closed. In the course of the investigation, an aquarium colleague of Wesson said he revealed that he had been working with young people at church ministries but had quit because some of the clergy made accusations that he was 'too friendly' towards some youth he was working with. Suspected pedophile Randy Wesson resigned from the Sea Life Aquarium in Grapevine, Texas in 2012 after a mother complained to management because he approached her wanting to babysit her son . The co-worker also said Wesson had told her 'out of the blue' that he had been sexually abused as a child. Last Tuesday, Wesson was arrested in Fort Worth after police following a tip-off about child porn. Investigators said he admitted to sexually abusing more than 100 children between the ages of 7 and 14. According to an arrest affidavit, detectives said Wesson 'confessed that police would find approximately 42,000 child pornography images on his computer, thumb drive, phone and SD cards'. Ricardo Javid Lugo, 17, was also arrested after he allegedly enrolled in the sixth grade at Hurst Hills Elementary School in August using fake documents while  Wesson posed as his father to possibly groom victims. During a search of Lugo's phone, officers found images of 'children at school, dated August 25 through 26, 2014'. A video on Lugo's cell phone dated August 31, 2014, showed Lugo spanking a child who appeared in a previous photograph taken at school, reported NBC DFW. In one message, Lugo told Wesson that he saw one child's genitals and 'talks about telling other kids not to tell, and having to follow them home to see where they live,' according to the affidavit. Police were investigating the number of victims and have asked parents at the school to talk to their children. An investigation revealed that Ricardo Javis Lugo, 17, has been enrolled in sixth grade at Hurst Hills Elementary in Texas since August and may have done so to capture child pornography . According to the arrest affidavit, Lugo (pictured left and right) and Wesson met on Instagram in 2013 when Lugo was using the name Matthew and living in Mexico . The elementary school has also provided counselors to try to find out if any children were targeted. The investigation into Wesson began in June after at online tip was received by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, connecting child porn with the username 'littleboy8' and an email address. This was found to be linked to Wesson. Posts using the email address were made in a 'bedwetting forum', according to the star-telegram.com. The man indentified himself as a '26 years old daddy' looking for a 'baby boy'. According to the affidavit, one post read: 'I want to change you (wet or messy) feed you bathe you and play with you. I am looking for temporary or permanent. I want my baby to be smooth and under 21. My baby will be treated like a real baby.' Police tracked down Wesson in November after the detective in charge of the case went on medical leave for several months. When police got in touch with Wesson's father, Bruce Wesson, he cooperated and told investigators that he thought his son was gay and may have looked at child pornography. Bruce Wesson said that his son Randy showed up at his home in February with a 12-year-old boy he called Matthew whom he claimed that his mother did not want anymore. Bruce Wesson said that Matthew would not talk about his past, was six feet tall - but still wore diapers to bed. Lugo and Randy Wesson reportedly met on Instagram last year when Lugo was using the name Matthew and living in Mexico. Wesson told investigators he and Lugo have had a sexual relationship since that time. Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent School District said Lugo enrolled in August. District officials said Wesson posed as Lugo's father during the process and provided a birth certificate, immunization records and proof of residency. 'Hurst Hills staff followed all procedures regarding enrollment when the student was enrolled in August,' the statement read. 'There was no indication that the student's records were forged or that the student was too old to attend elementary school.' Randy Wesson is due in court on Tuesday morning to face federal charges of distribution of child pornography. Lugo is being held in Hurst Jail on $250,000 bail where he faces a charge of child pornography.","Randy Wesson, 28, was suspended from his job as an 'education associate' at Sea Life Aquarium in Grapevine, Texas in 2012 .

"Eating healthily can sometimes be a struggle, but one artist has found a unique way to encourage himself to eat better. Artist Mike Kravanis makes tasty characters from movies such as The Little Mermaid, 101 Dalmatians, Up and Peter Pan, using rice, vegetables and seafood for his lunch. The 39-year-old became interested in food art after visiting Hong Kong and Japan. Scroll down for video . Tinkerbell from Peter Pan: The artist estimates that he has created more than 250 different bento boxes .

"A four-year-old boy who plunged 230ft down a cliff and somehow survived has awoken from a coma after 10 days. Sebastion Johnson was walking along a coastal path in Bodega Bay, California, with his parents when he fell on to a rocky beach, but was miraculously still alive when rescuers found him. The child, dubbed 'miracle monkey' by his mother, is slowly regaining strength and is on track to make a full recovery. Sebastion Johnson, four, survived after plunging 230ft down a cliff and has now awoken from a medically-induced coma after 10 days . Still smiling: Sebastion has regained the strength to hold his mother's hand but faces a long road to recovery . Sebastion and his parents Daryl Johnson and Jamie Guglielmino were on a family outing on a trail in Bodega Bay earlier this month when he tumbled over the cliff edge. Firefighters spotted him at the beach at the bottom of the cliff and rappelled down to rescue him, with the coastguard setting off flares to guide them through the darkness and down on to the rocks. Remarkably Sebastion was awake and crying when the rescuers reached the stricken four-year-old, who was rushed to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital in a critical condition. He had broken both hips, a leg, an arm and his jaw and was put in a medically-induced coma. Finally, 10 days later, Sebastion awoke from his coma and has since regained the strength to hold his mother's hand, Today reported. Ms Guglielmino said: 'Like angels guided him down. He fell 23 stories and survived. He's the boy that lived. 'I'm amazed that he pulled through. We've given him the nickname miracle monkey. 'All he knows is that he’s in pain and mommy’s there,' Guglielmino told ABC. 'He looks at me. I can tell in his eyes, like, ""Where am I mommy?""'

Sebastion was rushed to hospital with a number of broken bones, including his jaw, and was placed in a coma by doctors . Northern California's Bodega Bay, where the boy fell from a cliff, is pictured . Sebastion, who has been out of his coma for five days, is still hooked up to tubes in hospital and is unlikely to be discharged soon, but he is on the road to recovery, doctors have said. Speaking of the moment she realised her son had fallen off the cliff, Ms Guglielmino said: 'It was frustrating and terrible. I was torn apart. 'We were walking along the path throwing rocks and he fell down the cliff.' Mr Johnson said: 'I wanted to jump off and grab him and make sure he was alive. 'He just misstepped and the ground gave and he just flew right down. The incident that happened was my worst nightmare.' Fire Captain Justin Fox said at the time: 'He was at the water line and it was low tide. If it was high tide, he wouldn't have been easy to find.' The four-year-old's rescue at Bodega Bay was the second in three days after a woman, 23, slipped 20ft while climbing rocks in Bodega Head.","Sebastion Johnson, four, plunged 230ft down a cliff earlier this month .

"A swimming official who had a sexual relationship with a promising young swimmer gave her a diamond ring and a sex toy, a Brisbane court has heard. The 57-year-old introduced himself to the girl's parents in 2010 as 'a man of means in terms of obtaining sponsorship' after watching her compete as a 14-year-old, the Brisbane District Court heard on Monday. With her parents' permission, he travelled with the girl to various international competitions throughout 2011 and by 2012 their relationship had become sexual with frequent contact over Facebook, text messages and Skype calls. A 57-year-old swimming official allegedly had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old promising young swimmer . 'Even (her) parents noticed the increased interest of the defendant in their daughter,' Crown Prosecutor Phil McCarthy told the court on the first day of the trial. 'They will tell you they dismissed it as simply attentive interest in their exceptional child.' During a trip to New Zealand in late 2012, the man presented the swimmer with a purple vibrator, which he subsequently used on her, the court heard. The pair drank together in their hotel and the defendant was 'continually topping up her drink' before she eventually lost her virginity to him, Mr McCarthy said. During their relationship, the man gave her a diamond ring and a sex toy . The relationship soured in January 2013 when, also during a trip to New Zealand, the man entered her hotel room, pushed a couch against the door, tied her to the bed and assaulted her repeatedly. 'The event upset (her) greatly and she cried. (They) fought after the incident and she went to the balcony intent on ending her own life,' Mr McCarthy said. The girl's parents became aware of the relationship after intercepting a Facebook conversation in which she had confided in an older friend, the court heard. The defendant pleaded not guilty to eight counts of engaging in sexual intercourse with a young person outside Australia when in a position of trust or authority, and four counts of engaging in sexual activity other than intercourse. The 57-year-old introduced himself to the girl's parents in 2010 as 'a man of means in terms of obtaining sponsorship' after watching her compete as a 14-year-old . The man's defence team has submitted admissions including that he was aware of the girl's age at the time of their relationship. 'The critical issue anticipated in this trial is that the crown proving that (he) was indeed in a position of authority or trust at the time of the particular offending,' Mr McCarthy said. The man, who organised accommodation and travel for swimming teams, faces a five-day trial before Judge Brad Farr.

"Once regarded as harbingers of doom, fiery meteors are believed to strike the Earth at complete random. But a new study into impact trends suggests meteor strikes are more likely to occur at certain times of the year and at certain locations. The Spanish study found that the frequency of impacts was higher when Earth's orbit took it through streams of meteoroids created by the break-up of a comet. The Chelyabinsk meteor (pictured) was caused by a near-Earth asteroid that entered Earth's atmosphere over Russia on 15 February 2013. Scientists now believe events such as this are not as random as once thought . Most of the meteors analysed as part of the research also hit the Earth in the second half of the year, according to the University of Madrid. 'This lack of randomness is induced by planetary perturbations, in particular Jupiter's, and suggests that some of the recent, most powerful Earth impacts may be associated with resonant groups of Near Earth Objects and/or very young meteoroid streams,' the study claims. Planets and moon can affect meteors, pushing them into orbits called 'resonant streams'. Researchers looked at 33 multi-kiloton impact events from 2000 to 2013 that were detected by infrasound acoustic pressure sensors. Most of the meteors analysed as part of the research hit the Earth in the second half of the year, according to the University of Madrid. Pictured is the part of the large meteor that hit Russia in 2013 . In the southern hemisphere, June is the most likely month for a meteor to hit the Earth, while September and October were the least likely. North of the equator, November is the most likely month for a meteor hit, while May and June were the least likely. The study found that 17 impacts took place in the northern hemisphere and 16 in the south. The sensors are designed to detect secret nuclear tests, but also pick up meteor impacts with when they have an explosive energy in excess of a thousand tonnes of TNT. They found 17 impacts took place in the northern hemisphere and 16 in the south. Of these impact, 25 took place within 40 degrees north or south of the equator, while eight took place at higher latitudes. Twenty impacts across the second half of the year were recorded compared to just 13 hits in the first six calendar months – a 21 per cent difference in timing. In the southern hemisphere, June was the most likely month for a meteor to hit the Earth, while September and October were the least likely. In the southern hemisphere, June was the most likely month for a meteor to hit the Earth (artist's impression pictured), while September and October were the least likely . Overall, 12 meteor impacts took place in the second half of the year compared to four in the first six months. North of the equator, November was the most likely month for a meteor hit while May and June were the least likely. Nine meteors hit Earth in the first half of the year and eight in the second half. 'What we had always assumed up until this paper, was that meteor impacts were random, occurring at any time and in any place,' Dr Simon O'Toole of the Australian Astronomical Observatory told ABC Science. But more data is needed. 'It's a very interesting paper, but 33 events is a statistically small sample range,' said Dr O'Toole. Collision course:  Map shows the number of asteroids striking Earth's atmosphere over a 20 year period . A flash of light from a fiery asteroid is often treated with intrigue when it is spotted on Earth. But scientists at Nasa suggest that  asteroids are smashing into the Earth's atmosphere at a higher rate than most people realise. According to a new map by the space agency,  it's a wonder we don't see fireballs raining down from the skies more frequently. The map from the space agency's Near-Earth Object Program, reveals that more than 556 space rocks smashed into the atmosphere over a 20-year period between 1994 and 2013. The orange dots on the diagram show the frequency of asteroids that hit locations during the day while the blue dots show those that hit at night. They are  measured in billions of Joules (GJ) of energy. Most space rocks were small and harmless and disintegrated when they hit the atmosphere. Yet there are exceptions. Last year on February 15, an asteroid which was 55 feet in diameter with a mass of up to 10,000 tons crashed to earth in the Urals region in Russia.","Study looked at 33 major meteor impact events between 2000 to 2013 .

"Jeffrey Darling, 48, was reported missing last Tuesday after calling authorities for help . A 48-year-old man reported missing in New Mexico has been found after crawling onto a highway with two broken legs. Jeffrey Darling was rushed to San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington last Thursday afternoon, and a spokesperson told the Daily Times that he was in a 'serious condition' going into the weekend. He had used his cell phone to call authorities at 1am on Tuesday to report that he was in trouble but they were unable to pinpoint his exact location and his battery later died. Three days later he emerged on the corner of U.S. Highway 64 and Andrea Drive, where he managed to flag down a motorist. San Juan County Sheriff's detective Lt. Cory Tanner says deputies believe Darling had vision problems and accidentally fell into a ravine. The only information they had on his whereabouts before his phone cut out was that he was near some 'cottonwood trees, a bridge and a building.' It was believed that he was in the Animas River corridor. However, a thorough search around the tree-lined stretch of water proved fruitless. An appeal was launched with a poster on Facebook describing Darling as a brown-haired 5ft 6in male, weighing around 160lbs. His outfit apparently consisted of a gray beanie hat, brown jacket and tan-colored pants. He was eventually found Thursday at 5:30pm about 300 yards from where he fell with evidence that he had managed to build a fire. Lt. Tanner said that it was incredible he managed to survive the three-day ordeal with no access to food or water.

Three-day ordeal: Authorities said it was incredible he managed to survive with no access to food or water . 'He survived the coldest nights of winter we've had so far,' Tanner said. Last week temperatures in Farmington, New Mexico, dropped well below minus five Celsius. Darling remained hospitalized Monday and was unable to speak with a reporter.

"Mario Batali's Italian restaurant, Babbo, is being sued for $10 million by one of its neighbors over smell and noise complaints. Nurretin Akgul, who lives next-door to the star-studded eatery in Manhattan's trendy West Village, says he cannot sleep due to the kitchen's pungent garlic odors and noisy air conditioners. He told the New York Post: 'I can smell everything they cook, the garlic, and when they use chemicals to clean the exhaust dust we get the stuff in our windows. It's really a nuisance.' Bad neighbor? Mario Batali's popular New York City restaurant Babbo is being sued for $10 million by a neighbor for being too loud and smelly . The suit alleges that Mr Akgul is having trouble sleeping because of the 'unrelenting vibrations and a chronic hum' from the restaurant's air conditioners. Mr Akgul says 'the humming is so intense, I cannot even open my window in the back.' According to the suit, Mr Batali applied for a special permit required for a commercial eatery in a residential neighborhood last year. It claims that Mr Batali promised that if Mr Akgul did not oppose the permit he would make sure that the restaurant stopped disturbing the neighborhood by, among other things, soundproofing its walls and dealing with the pervasive smell. Mr Akgul argues that Mr Batali has not held up his end of the deal. Jack Lester, Mr Akgul's lawyer. says that once Mr Batali was granted the special permit, 'he just turned his back on my client.' Under fire: Celebrity chef Mario Batali allegedly made a deal to make Babbo a better neighbor in order to receive a special permit to keep the restaurant open in a residential district . Babbo is a favorite with the A-list, with fans including Katie Holmes, Robert Pattinson, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. But of course, Mr Batali and Babbo are no strangers to controversy. Less than a year ago, the chef and his partner Joseph Bastianich were forced to pay $5.25 million to their employees for skimming 4-5% of cash off of tips. The plaintiffs also claimed that they were forced to work over 40 hour work weeks without even making minimum wage. Both of the suit's two leaders were former employees of Babbo and one claims she was sexually harassed while working there and had the word 'rat' written on her locker after filing the suit. Even though Mr Akgul's is the first formal civil suit, neighbors have been complaining about Babbo for years saying that the smells, noise, and crowds make the restaurant a terrible neighbor. Mr Batali and his restaurant group have declined to comment to the Daily Mail on the lawsuit.","West Village restaurant Babbo is a favorite of stars including Katie Holmes, Robert Pattinson, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West ."
"Amazon customers can now pick up their parcels from Post Office branches as part of a huge expansion of its ‘click and collect’ service. The deal will offer a lifeline to some of Britain’s struggling rural Post Offices as it brings more customers through the doors. From today, those who buy from the US giant can collect their orders from 10,500 Post Office branches out of 11,500. Only the smallest branches, such as those in sheds, schools and pubs, will be exempt. Scroll down for video . Amazon customers can now pick up their parcels from Post Office branches as part of a huge expansion of its ‘click and collect’ service. It means there are now more than 16,000 Amazon ‘pick-up points’ in the UK . It means there are now more than 16,000 Amazon ‘pick-up points’ in the UK. Customers can already collect their parcels from Amazon lockers, including at train stations, and hundreds of shops through a scheme called Collect+. Last month, Amazon also launched its ‘Pass my Parcel’ service which introduced same-day collection from 500 convenience stores and newsagents. But the retailer has now signed a deal with Local Collect – a collaboration between Royal Mail and the Post Office – offering a more traditional collection point for customers. Amazon also launched its ‘Pass my Parcel’ service which introduced same-day collection from 500 convenience stores and newsagents . Ninety-nine per cent of the population lives within three miles of a Post Office branch, making it a convenient pick-up point for millions of shoppers. Under the deal, Royal Mail will deliver all the parcels to the Post Office itself – a coup for the firm which only last week complained that it faced tough competition from Amazon’s delivery service. Royal Mail estimates that Amazon’s recently-launched 12-hour delivery service could singlehandedly dent its business by as much as two per cent in the short term. Christopher North, of Amazon, said yesterday: ‘Offering the collection of packages from Post Offices is another great way of providing our customers with the highest levels of convenience.’ Hundreds of Post Offices have closed in the last decade, although numbers have stabilised in recent years as they have tried to modernise, including offering longer opening hours and opening on Sundays. The new collaboration will increase footfall in Post Offices, encouraging customers to buy other products and services during their visit. Last year, sub-postmasters claimed some post offices faced an ‘extremely uncertain future’, warning many branches and retail outlets were under serious threat. But yesterday, George Thomson, general secretary of The National Federation of SubPostmasters, said: ‘This is good news for the UK’s subpostmasters, in what are difficult times for many trying to maintain their Post Office service. ‘This massive extension to Amazon’s PickUp programme will give customers easy and convenient access for collecting parcels, and even more reasons to visit their local post office.’ George Martin of the Post Office said: ‘It is terrific news. It will offer anther service for existing customers and attract a whole new group of customers into the Post Office.’ The deal will offer a lifeline to some of Britain’s struggling rural Post Offices as it brings more customers through the doors. Ninety-nine per cent of the population lives within three miles of a Post Office branch . Only the Post Office’s smallest branches, such as those in sheds, schools and pubs, will be exempt from the service. Prior to the new agreement, customers could return Amazon items through the Post Office but not collect them from there. Dave Ward, of the Communication Workers Union, said: ‘The Post Office has undergone major transformation over the past two years losing nearly 20 per cent of its network but with innovations such as this, it shows that the post office network is still very relevant for today’s communities. ‘Post office workers offer a professional and reliable service and the sooner the Post Office realises this and stops selling them off, the better.’","Deal will offer a lifeline to some of Britain's struggling rural Post Offices .

"Grizzly bears in Montana have begun to follow hunters, researchers believe. A Government project fitted eight bears in the area with GPS. It found that bears stalk Elk hunters to steal their prey, tracking them almost from the moment they leave their cars. Hunting the hunters: The team found a bear fitted with GPS followed downwind of hunters as they went after an elk - possibly looking to steal it from them once it had been killed. In one encounter already tracked, as one group of hunters left a parking area at around 6 a.m. they turned on their GPS. As they moved around a lake in search of elk a nearby GPS-collared grizzly starts moving in the same direction behind and to the side of the hunters — probably downwind of them. At one point, the bear is within about 100 yards of the hunters who never knew it was there. After bedding down around noon, the bear picks up the hunters' now-cold trail and follows them again, possibly hoping they would shoot an elk. Already, data has shown at least one grizzly following oblivious elk hunters almost from the moment they left the parking lot, according to the Billings Gazette. Scientists believe the bear may have been following the humans in hopes of getting to a fallen elk before they did. In one encounter already tracked by the Montana team, as a group of hunters moved around a lake in search of elk a nearby GPS-collared grizzly starts moving in the same direction behind and to the side of the hunters — probably downwind of them. At one point, the bear is within about 100 yards of the hunters, who never knew it was there. After bedding down around noon, the bear picks up the hunters' now-cold trail and follows them again, possibly hoping they would shoot an elk. 'Bears opportunistically scavenge carcasses throughout the active season and commonly usurp kills of other predators, such as cougars and, since their reintroduction in 1995, gray wolves,' the  Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, which carried out the study, said. 'Remains left by hunters also provide grizzly bears with meat, and bears are attracted to areas outside of national parks when these remains become available during the fall.' Experts have previously said they believe bears stalk hunters from as close as the length of a football field in order to steal their prey. In one encounter already tracked by the Montana team, as a group of hunters moved around a lake in search of elk a nearby GPS-collared grizzly starts moving in the same direction . The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, part of the U.S. Geological Survey, started the project over the summer, by tagging the grizzlies in the Grand Teton National Park. The team also asked elk hunters to carry 100 GPS units that track their routes. Grizzlies have been known to steal the prey of hunters and fishermen alike. Scientists believe they may even listen for the sound of gunshots, knowing that they signal a meal to be scavenged. The team track bears to follow their breeding and hunting habits. Hunters and bears often collide in the fall because of a common interest in eating fresh, wild protein. Fall hunting season brings a number of individuals into the woods hoping to move stealthy and sneak up on deer and elk. At the same time, the grizzlies are in 'hyperphagia', which is the stage before they enter hibernation. During this time, the grizzlies are consuming as many calories as possible to gain fat for their long slumber. Gut piles and carcasses left by hunters provide an easy source of food. Eight Montana grizzly bears have been outfitted with GPS trackers in an ongoing study . Grizzly bears' have a sense of smell seven times greater than that of a bloodhound, and 100 times that of a human by some estimates. Grizzlies also possess a Jacobson's organ in the roof of their mouth that can detect heavier moisture-borne odors. Animals such as elk may travel for miles after being wounded, leaving hunters the task of tracking them even as bears may be doing the same. So attuned to the movements of hunters are the bears that  Grizzlies are known scavengers, and officials noted there have been cases of the mighty bruins attacking hunters as they dressed elk in the field. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks now requires successful bison hunters outside of Yellowstone National Park to move carcasses and gut piles 200 yards away from homes, roads and trails to lessen the chances of human-bear interactions, according to the Gazette.","Eight bears in Montana were fitted with trackers as part of experiment .

"Claims: A new book alleges Sarah Palin has taken cocaine in the past and had a six-month affair with a former business partner of her husband Todd . Sarah Palin snorted cocaine off a 55 gallon oil drum while snowmobiling with friends and had illicit affairs with a top NBA star and one of her husband's business partners, a new book sensationally claims. In revelations which could strike a devastating blow to the controversial politician's hopes of joining the 2012 presidential race, Mrs Palin is said to have taken the class A drug with her husband, while smoking marijuana at college in secret liaisons with one of her professors. Joe McGinniss's book The Rogue: Searching for the Real Sarah Palin, which is due to be published on September 20, also alleges that the former governor of Alaska is far from the traditional family woman she claims to be. Mrs Palin, 47, had a one-night stand with Miami Heat basketball star Glen Rice less than a year before she eloped with her husband, the book claims. She is said to have met the 6ft 8ins . player in 1987 when he was playing in a college basketball tournament in . Alaska and she worked as a sports reporter for KTUU television. It is also claimed that she had a six-month affair with Brad Hanson, who ran a snowmobile dealership with her husband Todd - a betrayal which led to Todd dissolving their business. In a bid to expose Mrs Palin's . skeletons, Mr McGinness has studied the former vice presidential . candidate for three years and last year even moved in to a home next . door in Wasilla, Alaska, to dig some more. Heat: The book alleges that Palin had a one night stand with basketball star Glen Rice . The author writes that after college Mrs Palin developed a 'fetish' for black men. She allegedly had a tryst with . basketball star Glen Rice in her younger sister Molly's University of . Alaska dorm room, while she was dating Todd and just nine months before . the couple were married. Six months: Palin is said to have had an affair with Brad Hanson, one of her husband's colleagues . Mrs Palin got pregnant with Todd and they eloped in August 1988. Their son Track, the oldest of five, was born eight months later in April 1989. A . friend said Mrs Palin spent the night with the basketball star but . could not confirm whether they had sex, according to the National . Enquirer. 'I remember Sarah feeling pretty good that she'd been with a black basketball star,' a source told the magazine. The athlete is said to have confirmed the night of passion in Mr McGinniss's book. Mr Rice went on to have a huge career playing basketball in the NBA and was a three-timer All-Star. The book goes on to claim that while married Mrs Palin also had an affair with one of her husband's business partners. Todd is alleged to have ended all dealings with Brad Hanson after he found out about the secret six-month relationship in 1996. Both Mrs Palin and Mr Hanson have denied the allegations. Perhaps most damaging of all could be the suggestion that the supposed traditional all American mother has taken drugs. Separation?: Todd Palin, seen here with his wife outside their house in Wasilla, Alaska, is said to be filing for a divorce . Headlines: The book, written by Joe McGinniss and released this week, claims Todd (right) dissolved the snowmobile business he ran with Brad Hanson after discovering the affair . Mr McGinness writes that while Mrs . Palin attended Mat-Su College she took marijuana with a professor who . was also the father of one of her female friends. Before . she was elected governor she is also said to have snorted cocaine with . her husband off an overturned oil drum while snowmobiling with friends. Todd, . who was arrested for driving drunk in 1986 used cocaine a lot and was . 'on the end of a straw plenty,' according to a long-term associate . quoted in the book. Joe McGinness is a controversial author who has built a career on immersing himself in extreme subjects in order to, in his own words, ‘search for the truth, however elusive… Penetrating the façade of institutions and people in public life’. The writer gained notoriety aged 26 when his first book about how Richard Nixon marketed himself, titled The Selling of the President 1968, became an overnight success – leading to him becoming the youngest living author with a book on the New York Times bestseller list. He has since written a combination of true crime books and political exposés, as well as one non-fiction account of a year exploring Alaska. In 1983, his take on the notorious Jeffrey MacDonald murder case led him being sued, with MacDonald alleging McGinniss made him believe he was on his side before slamming him in the book. The case settled out of court. Even before moving in next door Sarah Palin, McGinness, 68, had tried to get close to her, offering more than $60,000 have dinner with the politician at a charity auction in 2009. He lost to a winning bid of 63,500. When the Palins found out about their new neighbour, Sarah wrote on her Facebook page: ‘We're sure to have a doozey to look forward to with this treasure he's penning. ‘Wonder what kind of material he'll gather while overlooking Piper's bedroom?’ The . explosive book goes on to quote those who knew the family growing up, . claiming Mrs Palin was a 'bad mum' who would lock herself in her room . for hours on end asking not to be disturbed while her children cooked . themselves dinner. Sarah Palin was plucked from obscurity to be the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008. The 'pitbull in lipstick' sparked a media storm after accepting the nomination, despite questions over her experience. But she wowed the U.S. after a . barn-storming speech in September 2008 in which she attacked critics for . calling her 'small town'. A former mayor of Wasilla before she . became governor of Alaska, Palin stepped down after the Republican . defeat in the presidential election. The . mother-of-five has remained tight-lipped on whether she would stand . next year, but said she would likely make an announcement at the end of . this month. She has been overshadowed in recent months by Tea Party candidates including Michelle Bachmann. The . Republican, who has now associated herself with the Tea Party movement . in the U.S., has been dogged by scandal since being selected as Senator . John McCain's running mate in 2007. There have also been frequent rumours that she is set to divorce her husband Todd, which have always been denied. And she has faced accusations by the . father of her daughter's child, Levi Johnston, that she wanted to keep . Bristol's pregnancy a secret and adopt the child herself. Palin has yet to declare whether she intends to run for election in next year's presidential race. Joe McGinniss, 68, has written several political books including works on former president Richard Nixon and on Alaska. Explosive: The book, written by Joe McGinness, right, could halt Palin's 2012 bid before it has started . Next door: A fence in between the Palins' home, right, and neighbour, author Joe McGinness's home, left . But his work on the state sparked vitriol from Palin after he refuted her claims to have secured the construction of a $40billion natural gas pipeline. The antagonism heightened after he took up the offer of renting a small house next door to Sarah Palin's in Wasilla in summer 2010. It saw Palin write several posts on her Facebook account and articles in the right-wing press scathing Mr McGinniss's approach to writing the book. Mr McGinniss has since moved away from Wasilla after completing his book.","Former vice presidential candidate alleged to have snorted cocaine off an oil drum .

"The Health Service will be given an extra £1.5 billion next winter, Nick Clegg signalled yesterday.

Referring to putting aside money to cover costs after the general election in May, he said: ‘We should and I believe we will.’ He suggested there was cross-party support for the ‘compelling analysis’ of funding needs by NHS boss Simon Stevens, which said an extra £8 billion a year would be needed by 2020 on top of efficiency savings.

There appeared to be cross-party support for the ‘compelling analysis’ of the funding needs compiled by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, he said, which concluded that another £8 billion a year will be needed by 2020 on top of efficiency savings. The extra £1.5 billion was ‘broadly derived’ from that analysis, he suggested, adding that the Government had to ‘walk the walk and not just talk the talk’ when it came to health spending. ‘I have come to the view that we need to now agree a step-change in the amount of financial support that we give to the NHS in the years to come,’ he told a press conference. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has already announced £700 million more to help the NHS get through this winter. Mr Clegg said: ‘We should be saying that we are not only going to make financial commitments to the NHS now.

"Our insatiable desire to have the latest and greatest gadgets is causing landfills around the world to overflow with unwanted electronics. Last year consumers from around the world threw away 48.9million tonnes of electrical and electronic goods, and this figure is set to rise by a third by the end of 2017. This would mean the number of fridges, TVs, mobile phones, tablets, computers and other electrical products being thrown away could fill a line of 40-tonne trucks stretching three quarters of the way around the Equator - or 18,600 miles. Click on the map below to compare e-waste across 84 countries . By the end of 2017, the amount of e-waste produced globally will be 11 times the weight of 200 Empire State Buildings. This interactive map, compares the waste produced by 184 countries. Differing shades of grey indicate the different countries analysed . China put 11million tonnes of  electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) on to the market and produced 7.2million tonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 11lbs per person. The U.S put 9.9million tonnes of EEE on to the market, and produced 9.4million tonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 63lbs per person. The UK put 1.6 million tonnes of EEE on to the market, and produced 1.3million tonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 46lbs per person. Qatar put 5million tonnes EEE on to the market in 2012 and produced 1.1million tonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 139lbs per person. This is the equivalent of 11 times the weight of the Pyramid of Giza or 200 Empire State Buildings. The forecast has been made by the Solving the E-Waste Problem (StEP) Initiative - a partnership of UN organisations, industry, governments, non-government and science organisations. The initiative has created an interactive map that compares the amount of e-waste produced by 184 countries, as well as how much electrical and electronic equipment, or EEE, each country makes. The map shows, that almost 48.9million tonnes of used electrical and electronic products were produced last year. This works out at approximately 15lbs per person across the entire globe. Based on current trends, StEP experts predict that by 2017 the total volume will be 33 per cent higher at 65.4million tonnes. Qatar put 57 metric kilotonnes of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) on to the market in 2012. The country produced 116 metric kilotonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 139lbs per person. Whereas the UK put 1.6 metric kilotonnes of EEE on to the market and produced 1.3 metric kilotonnes of e-waste . Research recently found that people in the UK  binning 17 million gadgets worth £762million every year. One . in three adults needlessly dumps devices such as mobiles, games . consoles, satnavs, MP3s and digital cameras, according to phone operator . O2. According to SquareTrade, 1.2million people have never taken their electronic gift out of the box and one million people admitted to re-gifting a present to someone else. One in ten (9 per cent) have damaged or broken a device they received for Christmas by New Year's Day. Around 900,000 people have sold an electronic gift on eBay, or to a friend. Nearly 600,000 people have returned or exchanged an electronic gift they received. 'Although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods, the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem,’ said Ruediger Kuehr of United Nations University and Executive Secretary of the StEP Initiative. ‘We believe that this constantly updated, map-linked database showing e-waste volume by country together with legal texts will help lead to better awareness and policy making at the public and private levels.' The StEP e-waste world map database shows that in 2012 China and the U.S. topped the world’s totals in the amount of EEE and e-waste combined. China put 11.1million tonnes of EEE on the market in 2012, followed by the U.S. with 10million tonnes. When it came to e-waste generated last year, the U.S. had the world’s highest figure of 9.4million tonnes and China generated the second highest e-waste total of 7.3millon tonnes. The UK put 1.6million tonnes of EEE on the market in 2012, and produced 1.3millon tonnes of e-waste. The data also found that each American was responsible for an average 65lbs of hi-tech trash, which was almost six times higher than China’s per capita figure of 11lbs. The UK produced 48lbs per inhabitant, while Qatar produced the most per person, however, with a staggering 139lbs per person.

Mr Maudlen's dad Robert, 64, speaking from the family home in Modbury Heights told Daily Mail Australia, the family were trying to pull together despite being spread out across the globe. He said: 'Deb left to be with Ryan on Satruday, she took our laptop and so she can call me on Skype. 'I am hearing news from my daughter Rachel who is in London and then she is letting me know the latest information. 'Ryan had been feeling crook for a few days before he fell ill but he just kept saying 'I will be fine; and then it all happened.

'I can’t believe the charges, when he was admitted, Katty had to find $15,000 straight away. 'We are devastated, we never ever expected it to happen, we always thought he might have problems but over the past two years he has been so good and not needed medication.' Mr Maudlen's father explained his son and girlfriend were supposed to carry on their travels after going through Mexico. Katharina spoke to 9News about her boyfriend's plight and asked for fundraising help . 'They bought an old Toyota and they went to Alaska and back down through Canada into the US and then onto Mexico. 'They were supposed to go to Panama and through the eastern side to the bottom of Argentina.' he said. The last time Mr Maudlen had problems with his Crohn’s disease was when he was 18.

"A cancer-ravaged teacher who traveled across the country visiting former students to see what difference he had made to their lives has died age 41. David Menasche was an English teacher at a Miami school when he was given just months to live after being diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer in 2006. When his cancer robbed him of his ability to continue teaching, he decided to end his treatments and reconnect with his former students. Scroll down for video . David Menasche was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer in 2006, but lived for another eight years during which the Miami English teacher went on an amazing journey . ‘David passed away early this morning at home, surrounded by his family. He is, and will always be, loved,’ a family member wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. Earlier this year Menasche published his memoir, The Priority List: A Teacher’s Final Quest To Discover Life’s Great Lessons, but told the story of his 101-day 'Vision Quest' during which he traveled more than 8,000 miles, visiting 75 former students in 31 cities. A movie version of the book is in the works with Steve Carell playing Menasche. The actor was one of the many people who took to social media to offer their condolences after learning about Menasche’s death. ‘R.I.P. David Menasche. Beloved teacher. A man who changed lives,’ Carell tweeted. More than 200 Facebook users commented on the post announcing Menasche’s death. Actor Steve Carell, who is set to play the teacher in a film version of his memoir, tweeted this tribute to David Menasche . Menasche's memoir, The Priority List: A Teacher’s Final Quest To Discover Life’s Great Lessons, tells the story of his 101-day 'Vision Quest' during which he traveled more than 8,000 miles, visiting 75 former students in 31 cities - it is being turned into a movie with Steve Carell due to play the teacher . “You were a true inspiration. Thank you for the lessons you taught us, even those of us who were not privileged enough to have been in your physical classroom,” one commenter wrote. Menasche had spent 15-years teaching at Coral Reef Senior High School in Miami but three invasive surgeries, two-and-a-half years of chemotherapy and 30 rounds of radiation therapy had left him almost-blind and with limited mobility. Unable to continue teaching his 11th graders, Menasche set off in November 2012 on a countrywide trip to meet his former students to simply ask them if he had made a difference in their lives. The Mark Twain devotee dubbed his . journey the 'Vision Quest' and in August of 2012, Menasche posted a . message to Facebook, asking if any of his 3,000 former Coral Reef alumni . wanted to meet him, reminisce about his lessons and most importantly - . let him sleep on their couch.

Menasche had spent 15-years teaching at Coral Reef Senior High School in Miami but three invasive surgeries, two-and-a-half years of chemotherapy and 30 rounds of radiation therapy had left him almost-blind and with limited mobility . Despite a seizure robbing him of his sight and the use of most of the left side of his body, Menasche resolved to undertake the trip on his own by bus. I just wanted that sense of satisfaction that the time I did have I used well,' he told USA Today in January. The oldest of his students were in their early 30s - some with families of their own - and the popular English teacher wanted to 'get caught up and see the results of my work.' The inspirational teacher spent 101 days on the road and visited 31 cities across 8,000 miles, speaking to 75 former students who lived as far afield as Hawaii. One ex-pupil was Stephan Palahach, who is now an aspiring screenwriter in New York City. He told USA Today that Menasche was 'one of the few teachers I felt who were really present. I've had great teachers in my life, but he was really present in the moment.' Nationwide: This map shows pins set down across the United States where David Menasche met former students - traveling 8,000 miles by bus and air in the process . ‘David passed away early this morning at home, surrounded by his family. He is, and will always be, loved,’ a family member wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday . The former student and one-time teacher spent time together talking and going to the movies. 'There was a fleeting moment when we were sitting around a computer sharing silly Internet videos together and laughing,' Palahach said. 'He ceased to be my old teacher, and he was definitely a friend.' His failing health was never an excuse and Menasche made it to Boston, Chicago, San Diego, Los Angeles, Portland, Hawaii and Minneapolis among other cities. Along the way he discovered something poignant and wonderful: 'It seems like it was not a wasted life,' he said. 'I wasn't so sure - I honestly wasn't.' Diagnosed with terminal brain cancer the day before Thanksgiving in 2006, aged 34 - Menasche was told then he had less than a year to live. The inspirational teacher spent 101 days on the road and visited 31 cities across 8,000 miles, speaking to 75 former students who lived as far afield as Hawaii . Refusing to be bowed by this death sentence, he threw himself into his work. 'For six years, the only time I wasn't in class was when I was undergoing brain surgery. I never avoided the topic of my cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, with my students, but it was not something I dwelled on, nor did they,' he said to CNN. 'I covered my bald, lacerated head with a woolen hat and scheduled chemotherapy around my classes, and I got so good at being sick that I could run to the bathroom, heave into the toilet, flush, brush my teeth and fly back to class in under three minutes. They pretended not to notice.' Then in the summer of 2012 he was hit by a huge seizure which robbed him of his ability to teach any longer. 'The cancer had finally succeeded in taking me out of the classroom, but I wasn't ready to let it take me out of the game,' said Menasche to CNN. 'I wasn't afraid to die. I was afraid of living without a purpose.' Champion: David poses with the statue of Rocky at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, left, and  with former students in Memphis, Tennessee . The greatest lesson that Menasche learned on his journey was that he made the most difference in what he and his students came to dub 'intimate interludes' between classes, 'when we shared heartaches and vulnerabilities and victories.' 'To learn this meant the world to me, it really did,' said Menasche to CNN. 'The truth of it is those were the moments when I was trying my hardest, when I really wanted to be at my very best, so that I could set an example for them that they could look to. 'It was just overwhelming the generosity and love that I got back.' 'Not only did they give my life meaning while I was a teacher, even after I left the class room they continued to give me a sense of purpose.'","David Menasche, 41, has died from the incurable brain cancer that had left him almost blind and affected the left side of his body .

"Britain will be the most ethnically mixed country in the western world in less than 40 years, experts predicted yesterday. They claimed that the share of the population from an ethnic minority or migrant background will hit 38 per cent – overtaking other nations – in around 2050. And the study said Britain will become the most mixed country in Europe in around five years when the minority and migrant proportion of the population overtakes the same group in the Netherlands. A new study suggests Britain's ethnic make-up will be as diverse as the United States by 2050 . The analysis, prepared by Professor David Coleman of Oxford University for the Migration Observatory think-tank, is a fresh indicator of the impact of large-scale migration on life in Britain. Professor Coleman, an expert in demography, the study of how populations change, endorsed a projection he made two years ago suggesting that at current migration rates white British people will be a minority in the population by about 2066, in just over 50 years. In his new paper, he said these projections may prove to be too high if the Coalition keeps its pledge to reduce net migration – the difference between those  arriving in the country and those people leaving. ‘The highest migration projections for the UK put the crossover for the whole country, when the combined population of all ethnic minority groups together would exceed the population of white British, at around 2070, although it would have occurred in younger age groups and major urban areas rather earlier than that,’ Professor Coleman said. The study suggests significant changes in the ethnic make-up of Britain in the next four decades . Calming words: The UK will not have 'another Polish situation,' David Cameron, seen speaking in Bridgwater, Somerset, said regarding the possible influx of migrants from new EU nations . ‘But 57 years is a long time. That is looking far into the future and only illustrates the consequences of things remaining as they were in 2010. It assumes, for example, no enduring effect of the current Coalition Government’s attempts to reduce net immigration.’ The projections of which countries are likely to have the most ethnically mixed populations says that Britain will become more mixed than the United States shortly after 2050. However, the American estimates count black Americans descended from slaves and native Americans as one with the white American population, and regard only more recent arrivals as migrants or members of ethnic minority groups. The study predicted that Britain will have a higher migrant and ethnic minority population than that of Canada when the minority share hits 28 per cent in about 20 years. Professor Coleman said: ‘By about 2010, people with immigrant origins – that is first or second-generation foreign origin – comprised between 10 and 20 per cent of the population in many western European countries. ‘These projections indicate that populations of post-war immigrant origin will comprise between 20 and 40 per cent of national population totals by the middle of the 21st century if recent migration trends persist.’ According to the British national census in 2011, Leicester, Luton and Slough have populations where the majority of people are either foreign or ethnic minority members. Birmingham is likely to become another so-called ‘minority majority’ city by 2020. Several London boroughs have a non-white British majority population, including Newham in East London, where only one in six of the population is white British. The projections of population change in the UK do not take account of Tory plans to limit net immigration to the tens of thousands .","Britain to experience one of the biggest changes in population, study says .

"With panoramic views of the capital from a roof terrace, bespoke chairs and glass walls, this £80million six-storey building resembles that of a plush city hotel. But this is, in fact, Britain's most expensive comprehensive school - set to open next week in a leafy area of Kensington, west London, for 1,480 lucky pupils. Holland Park School, dubbed the 'socialist Eton', has unisex lavatories where no main door will be fitted to deter bullying, a glass-clad open-plan library and an exotic 25-metre basement swimming pool. Pupils in the new school will sit down on £300 bespoke chairs, left, created by one of Britain's leading furniture designers, Russell Pinch. Teachers will have their own version, right with arms - retailing at £400 .

The schools have been designed by . architects such as Richard Rogers and Norman Foster, renowned for their . high-tech, modern designs, often featuring soaring glass atriums. State schools built under Labour typically cost £21m-£50m and the lavish scale of Holland Park has caused friction among . local groups at a time of cuts in services. Union representatives have asked why a . new academy planned for north Kensington, one of the poorest parts of . the borough, has a budget of £28m. But Elizabeth Campbell, the council's cabinet member for education, told the Sunday Times she was proud of Holland Park. She said: 'We set out to build the best school in Britain and we have ended up with the best school in western Europe.' An artist's impression of the interior of the futuristic school that has glass walls and a glass roof, along with an atrium the length of the building . She argued that the building had cost the taxpayer nothing, adding: 'We raised £105m by selling off part of the site to housing developers and built a sixstorey school instead.' The school dubbed the 'socialist Eton' because it once attracted members of the Labour elite who lived locally but did not want to compromise their principles by using private education. The school now has Tory ministers in its catchment area, including George Osborne, who lives a short walk away. A few weeks ago,  according to the Sunday Times, a Holland Park parent reported that her daughter had seen Gove and his wife Sarah looking round with their nine-year-old daughter.

"A solar panel manufacturer that received a half-billion dollar loan as part of President Barack Obama's stimulus package is laying off 1,100 workers and filing for bankruptcy. Republicans are now looking into the . government's loan to Fremont, California-based Solyndra LLC, saying it was clear that the company was a . dubious investment. It is likely that the bankruptcy will . now serve as further ammunition for the President's opponents in . Congress to criticise the economic stimulus bill. In the spotlight: President Obama chats to managers during his visit to the Solyndra factory last year. The President is under pressure after the company, which received half a billion in federal loans, folded yesterday . Visited by the President last year as he outlined his economic stimulus package, Solyndra was the poster child for U.S. government investment in green technology. But hard times have hit the U.S.'s solar industry and Solyndra is the third solar company to seek bankruptcy protection in the past month. The price for solar panels has plummetted in part because of heavy competition from Chinese companies, dropping by about 42 percent this year. The House Energy and Commerce Committee have already subpoenaed documents relating to the loan from the White House Office of Management and Budget. 'We've smelled a rat from the outset,' GOP Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan and Cliff Stearns of Florida said in a joint statement published yesterday. Mr Upton and Mr Stearns said they would continue to seek documents that would provide more details about the Solyndra loan. They added: 'Unfortunately, Solyndra is just the latest casualty of the Obama administration's failed stimulus, emblematic of an economic policy that has not worked and will not work. 'We hope this informs the president ahead of his address to Congress next week.' Good investment? President Obama, left, tours the Solyndra solar panel company with Executive VP of Engineering Ben Bierman on May 26, 2010 . When Obama, who is set to address Congress to unveil a new jobs plan, toured Solyndra's facilities last year he said the investment was important because more clean energy would benefit the environment, the economy and national security. 'The future is here,' Obama said during his visit. 'We're poised to transform the ways we power our homes and our cars and our businesses. 'And we are poised to generate countless new jobs, good-paying, middle-class jobs, right here in the United States of America.' Energy Department spokesman Dan Leistikow said Solyndra was a once promising company that had increased sales revenue by 2,000 percent in the past three years. The $535million loan guarantee was sought by both the Bush and Obama administrations, he said, and private investors also put more than $1billion into Solyndra. 'We have always recognized that not every one of the innovative companies supported by our loans and loan guarantees would succeed, but we can't stop investing in game-changing technologies that are key to America's leadership in the global economy,' Mr Leistikow said. Folly? President Obama meets with construction workers building a new Solyndra solar panel factory on May 26, 2010 . Solyndra had been heralded as one of the nation's bright spots of green technology innovation. The company created an innovative solar 'tube' that could soak up sunlight from many different angles, producing energy more efficiently and using less space. The company's panels were also light and easy to install, which was meant to save up front costs. But over the past few years, other companies caught up and provided similar products at a lower cost. Brian Harrison, Solyndra's president and CEO, said that raising capital had become impossible. 'This was an unexpected outcome and is most unfortunate,' Harrison said in a statement published yesterday. Solyndra's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing topped a disastrous month for the U.S. solar power industry. Another solar company, Spectrawatt Inc. of Hopewell Junction, N.Y., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Aug. 19. Its CEO said in the filing that it could not compete with solar manufacturers in China, which receive 'considerable government and financial support.' Spectrawatt's filing came four days after Evergreen Solar Inc. of Marlboro, Mass., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But solar industry advocates claimed the three companies' failures were not indicative of the health of the U.S. solar industry as a whole. Rhone Resch, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said: 'In the last 18 months, solar companies have either added or expanded almost 60 factories in the U.S. and driven the installed cost of solar down by 30 percent.' Mr Resch defended the Energy Department's loan guarantee programme, adding that it 'will help to deploy enough clean solar energy to power nearly 1 million homes and create tens of thousands of jobs across 28 states.' Jesse Pichel, a clean energy analyst with New York-based investment firm Jefferies & Co. said Solyndra's products used unique technology that was more expensive to install, 'and the improvement was marginal at best.'","'The future is here' said Obama on visit to firm in 2010 .

"A grieving father today spoke of his outrage his daughter's murderer could be released from prison - in the year she would have turned 40. Peter Streader, 71, says Marrick Rogers, 39, who sexually assaulted and murdered his 23-year-old daughter Claire in 1999, should remain in prison until he's at least 65. But he says officials have told him  Rogers, who still hasn't admitted the murder despite being convicted on DNA evidence, could be released soon. Peter Streader, 71, says Marrick Rogers, 39, who sexually assaulted and murdered his 23-year-old daughter Claire in 1999, should remain in prison until he's at least 65 . Rogers strangled Claire with her own jumper and was jailed in June 2000. He has always denied the crime . Rogers was found guilty by a jury in June 2000 of killing Claire before strangling her with her own jumper and dumping her body in a park in Canterbury, Kent. He was handed a life sentence with a minimum of 12 and a half years and has served 15 years. Mr Streader says Rogers has recently been moved to an open prison and is enjoying home visits to see his family. The former engineer, of Chartham, Kent, said Rogers should not be allowed to continue with his life when mother-of-one Claire, who worked as a cleaner, had hers taken away. He said: 'People just don't seem to get life anymore. He's served 15 years, which is more than his minimum sentence, but to me it just isn't enough. 'I think a life imprisonment should a life sentence and it's not. 'I don't believe in capital punishment, I have always said that, but 65 seems likes an appropriate age to be released.' Sinister: The murderer dumped his victim's body in a park in Canterbury, Kent . He added: 'By that time you don't really have much of a life in front of you. 'You won't be able to get a job, you can't have a family, but all these things will be available to him when he gets out. 'All these things that he took away from Claire and us as a family.' Rogers, a taxi driver, was convicted at Lewes Crown Court after his saliva was found on Claire's breast and bra following the murder on May 31 1999. He was originally ordered to serve a minimum of 14 years in prison but that was reduced to 12-and-a-half years on appeal. Claire's parents made an attempt to fight the sentence, which they believed was too short, but they were knocked back. An appeal by Merrick against his conviction was rejected in 2006.","Marrick Rogers, 39, murdered mother-of-one Claire Streader, 23, in 1999 .

Cold and tired, I peel myself from the sheets, feeling the stiffness in my legs and the dull ache in the soles of my feet as they reluctantly touch the floor. Dead to the world, I push a toothbrush around my mouth, trying to avoid eye  contact with the zombie in the mirror. I pull on the battered trainers, tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt I'd dropped on the bedroom floor seconds before falling asleep last night, zip up my windproof jacket, clip my bike lights into place and set off on the hour-long ride to work. Meanwhile, the kitchen clock shows 5.30am. Once at work, I punch a code into a drinks machine and watch it spit tea into a paper cup, while other exhausted ghosts limp into view and exchange supportive nods of acknowledgment. I just have time to wolf down a breakfast cereal bar before my shift starts at 7am.  For the next 11-and-a-half-hours, I will be pushing a trolley around a giant warehouse in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. It's back-breaking work - I will probably walk a total of 20 miles today - just one ant among 1,500 others, scurrying around a vast complex of jaw-dropping logistical genius and breath-taking productivity. I don't think I have ever felt so exhausted in my life. I am working for Amazon at one of its eight UK fulfilment centres - the huge warehouses which store, process, package and deliver the online retailer's stock,  during the Christmas rush. This is not what I thought I'd end up doing, the Christmas after graduating from Jesus College Cambridge with a 2:1 degree in music. I'd hoped to be an officer in the Royal Navy by now - or earning good money as a jobbing musican, while the application process limped along. But work was  irregular and sometimes badly paid. I tried, and failed, to find other employment and reluctantly had to sign on the dole - something I prayed I'd never have to do. At Amazon, I am paid £7 an hour and have to work 55 hours a week, with no choice of when I do them. If I'm lucky, though, I can pick between day or night shifts. Does this mean I'm ungrateful? Certainly not. Nor does it mean I am the only graduate from an elite university working here. Far from being surrounded by uneducated manual workers, I am pushing my trolley alongside law graduates, classicists and mathematicians, many from top universities like mine. Educated: Ben pictured with his mother Anne at his graduation from Jesus College, Cambridge and at a university party . Queueing up in the Amazon  canteen the other day, I overheard two people discussing where they did their Masters. It's a common conversation-opener here. You are, in fact, just as likely to find someone to discuss the works of Pliny and Proust with, as you are to find a drinking partner for the pub. Far from being lazy and workshy, as is the current lament from employers about young British workers, none of my colleagues is complaining. They, like me, are grateful for the work - any work. It makes me smile when I think of all the people who will be opening the Christmas presents delivered by Amazon next week: books, DVDs and more. Who among them could guess at the sheer intellectual weight and quality of education behind the service? For it is hard out there. In the past six months, I must have applied for every job imaginable. One of them involved knocking on doors to sell double-glazing. 'Work hard, and you might earn as much as £200 in your first week,' we were told at interview. The next day I was rung to be told: 'We're sorry Mr Atkins, but we had 30 people applying for two jobs.' Privileged background: His parents didn't earn much, so Ben was fortunate to be given a bursary to Winchester College . Academic potential: Ben did so well at Winchester that he was admitted to Cambridge . Desperate for work, I even left a note on the windscreen of a  pick-up truck, offering to split the logs it was loaded with. Then my adviser at the JobCentre told me Amazon was recruiting, and suggested I apply. It is the world's largest online retailer, with a revenue four times greater than that of the next largest, eBay, and exceeding the GDPs of half the countries in the world. On average, it serves 20 million customers worldwide daily, and on December 2 this year Amazon UK beat the record it set just three days earlier by  selling 4.1 million items in one day –- or 47 a second. To respond to demand, 15,000 extra people are employed over the festive period at Amazon's UK warehouses. When I went for my induction, I was desperate to become one of them - despite my privileged education. About eight of us, aged between 20 and 40, were quizzed by a recruitment agency. The first question was whether we had our passports as ID. At this point, one member of the group left. He simply didn't possess one. Then we were told that there would be a drugs test and everyone would also be Criminal Records Bureau tested - and wouldn't be allowed to work if we had any unspent convictions. Again, the group diminished. The remaining five of us sat a simple test, after which another person was escorted from the room. After signing a few forms and peeing into a cup, the now select group was told: 'Training is at eight o'clock tomorrow, and you start work the day after that.' Apparently my tutor wasn't joking when he said I'd never be asked what class of degree I have. I soon got talking to Richard, who has worked for Amazon since the summer. 'I studied criminology with a view to becoming a policeman,' he explained. 'Only the week I graduated, the Government cut thousands of police jobs. 'I still want to join the force, or become a fireman, but for now this job is fine. What would be the point of taking a stand and refusing to do a job because I consider it below me? What's the alternative? I'd rather be working than doing nothing.' Henry is married, probably in his early 50s. He left the Army to study employment law. He's working for Amazon so he can save up to do his Masters at Cambridge and become a lecturer. Back-breaking work: Employees at Amazon's fulfillment centres often walk a total of 20 miles per day . Compensation: They are paid £7 an hour and have to work 55 hours a week, with no choice of when they work . World's largest online retailer: Amazon's revenue exceeds the GDPs of half the countries in the world . For every graduate employed by Amazon this Christmas, there are several more who didn't make it: including my elder brother, Alexander. He read maths at Cambridge and has just finished a computer science Masters at Bristol. On my second day at work, I called him during a precious break to tell him about the job and he rushed home from Bristol, just in time for an induction on the last day of recruitment. But the news was not what he had hoped. Despite passing all the tests, Alex was surplus to requirements. He's on the waiting list now, and hoping for a phone call in case an employee calls in sick. He is not alone. He lives with two other Bristol graduates: one is still jobless and the other has been working as a part-time shop assistant for 18 months. Heightened demand: Over the holidays, 15,000 extra people are employed at Amazon's UK warehouses - but many of those hoping for work are nonetheless turned away . 'Work hard, and you might earn as much as £200 in your first week,' Ben was told at interview . When my older sister, Serena, left Cambridge, a friend with a First in history was obliged to work for the first six months completely unpaid - something only the privileged can afford - while my sister spent months trying to get an interview. My other sister Bink also graduated from Cambridge this summer with a good 2:1 in classics, but is still unemployed. For me, the job is worth more than just Christmas money. Like many Cambridge students, and unlike many of my new colleagues, I had a privileged upbringing. Although my father, a clergyman, has never earned much and nor does my writer mother, I was extremely fortunate to be given a bursary to Winchester College. Less fortunate: Alexander, Ben's brother, read maths at Cambridge and has just finished a computer science Masters at Bristol. He hopes to find employment at Amazon . I wasn't a sheltered upbringing  - we lived in an inner-city vicarage, and often cared for the homeless. But most of my schoolfriends had little experience of life outside their elite social class. If my application to become a Naval officer is successful, I will serve on a warship alongside ratings (non-officers). This is considered to be one of the most important elements of training. I feel that working a Christmas season in an Amazon fulfilment centre is ample preparation. In here, we are all equal - just  workers, grafting to get the job done, and I relish the experience. As soon as I swipe my access card and enter the building, I am no longer a privileged individual, just a small cog in a vast machine. It is a humbling experience, and one I hope to remember wherever life takes me. And there are other perks in the meantime: on my first day I was taken to the top floor of the building, from where I could see the vast crates brimming with Christmas presents. Quite unexpectedly, something stirred inside me, and I couldn't wait to tell my ten-year-old youngest sister that I am  working in Santa's grotto because, let's face it, this is it, in reality. Now who could complain about having that on their CV?","Amazon is the world's largest online retailer .

"A Boston man remains in the hospital after  he fell naked through the ceiling of a women's bathroom at Logan Airport and then assaulted an elderly man. Prosecutors said Monday that 26-year-old Cameron Shenk is still at Massachusetts General Hospital, and they are unsure when he will be arraigned. Shenk faces charges including attempted murder, assault and battery on a person over 60, and lewd and lascivious conduct. Authorities say he had apparently sneaked into the bathroom, undressed inside a stall and climbed into the ceiling crawl space. He was injured in the fall. Cameron Shenk, 26, who sneaked into the women's bathroom at Boston's Logan Airport before climbing into a ceiling space naked, is still being treated in Massachusetts General Hospital, according to prosecutors . Investigators say the man fled the bathroom and assaulted an 84-year-old man he encountered. He then crashed through the ceiling, suffering cuts to his head and body, and attacked an elderly man while he was still naked and bleeding, leaving the pensioner with serious injuries, it is claimed. 'Once outside the restroom, for reasons still under investigation, Shenk assaulted and seriously injured an 84-year-old man,' Massachusetts State Police said in an online statement. 'That victim was later transported to a local area hospital with various injuries that are not expected to be life threatening.' Shenk, whose motive remains unknown, allegedly struggled with troopers who arrested him at the airport (pictured), injuring one of them . The alleged rampage on Saturday came on the same day that a 52-year-old male driver was arrested near the airport's (pictured, its interior) Terminal B after allegedly assaulting a 21-year-old female passenger .

"Police have arrested the parents of a nine-month-old girl after her father accidentally shot inside her New York City home with an illegally-owned gun. Pedro Rosales, 47, told officers he was cleaning his gun in his Brooklyn apartment when it  discharged on Sunday. The bullet hit the child in the hip. She was taken to Woodhull Medical Center and then transferred to Bellevue Hospital for surgery. Her injuries were not considered to be life-threatening. Scene: NYPD officers stand outside the apartment in Brooklyn where a nine-month-old girl was shot in the hip while her father cleaned his  gun. Pedro Rosales, 47, and mother Jessica Aguilar, 24, have been arrested .

Authorities revealed that he has also already been charged with weapons-related offences. The mother, Jessica Aguilar, 24, was arrested on reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child charges. The New York Post reported that the pair were riding the subway to Myrtle Avenue. When they got off the baby started to cry.

"A dying mother was forced to wait almost six months before seeing a cancer specialist - when a surgeon downgraded her case because she was aged under 35, a court heard today. Katie Maytum, now 35, of Maesteg, South Wales, is suing the Welsh NHS for £750,000, claiming surgeons ignored official cancer guidelines - robbing her of seeing her children grow up. The mother-of-two, who has terminal breast cancer, told the High Court in Cardiff that she was forced to wait five and half months before being seen by a specialist because of her age. Dying mother: Katie Maytum (left), 35, of Maesteg, is suing the Welsh NHS for £750,000. Surgeon Vummiti Murali-Krishnan (right) classed the case as not one of 'urgent suspected cancer' - because she was under 35 . Three breast cancer surgeons at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, went against national guidelines of treating all lumps in women over 30 as urgent, the hearing was told. Miss Maytum was aged 31 when she went to her local GP after noticing a lump in her left breast. She told the court today: ‘I couldn’t but think that there was cancer inside my body. ‘I know the feeling of a cyst and this was a hard lump which got bigger. It started off as a lump the size of a pea and continued through my menstrual cycle and continued afterwards. ‘I went to my GP as I was concerned with my family history - my grandmother and great aunts all had breast cancer.’ Her GP was so worried he faxed an ‘urgent referral’ form to the South West Wales Cancer Network - which brings together groups involved in planning, commissioning and provision of cancer care. But when surgeon Vummiti Murali-Krishnan received the referral form he downgraded her to ‘routine’ and classed the case as not one of ‘urgent suspected cancer’ - because she was under 35. Government guidelines state any woman aged 30 or older with a discrete lump which has persisted after her period should receive an urgent referral and be seen by a specialist within two weeks. In Wales this means Miss Maytum should have seen a specialist and had surgery to remove the tumour within two months. Treatment: Three breast cancer surgeons at the Princess of Wales Hospital (above) in Bridgend, South Wales, went against national guidelines of treating all lumps in women over 30 as urgent, the hearing was told . But because she had been downgraded to a routine referral she had to wait five and a half months to see a specialist, with the tumour growing in her breast and spreading through her body. An ultrasound scan performed on the day she finally saw the specialist confirmed her fears that she had cancer. She underwent surgery and lengthy chemotherapy and was cancer for free for several years until a lump appeared in her neck in April this year and she was told by doctors she had only 18 months to live. Miss Maytum told the hearing: ‘Standing or sitting for long periods of time is uncomfortable because of the cancer in my pelvis, spine and lower back. ‘It’s hard cleaning the house or lifting my youngest son. I receive a lot of help from my partner and mother-in law - they help with the children and cleaning.’ Nigel Poole QC, representing Miss Maytum, told the hearing that medical experts were in ‘broad agreement’ that a woman of her age would have had a 90 per cent chance of surviving more than 10 years with urgent treatment. He said: ‘That is what oncologists would regard as being cured. In the five and half month wait for treatment her chances of survival fell to between 70 and 80 per cent.’ Terminal cancer: Miss Maytum (pictured) is due to marry her partner next month and her children Megan and Zac will be by her side at the service . Miss Maytum is due to marry her partner next month and her children Megan, 14, and Zac, 10, will be by her side at the service. The mother, who was training to be a nurse when she was diagnosed as terminal, has been given 18 months to live. Miss Maytum is suing the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board claiming Mr Murali-Krishnan was negligent in downgrading her case to routine. Miss Maytum’s damages claim includes the ‘loss of unquantifiable services of a wife and mother’. These include £7,500 a year from April 2017 to April 2027, when her son Zac will be 21, to cover the cost of a nanny for 20 hours a week at £6.93 an hour. Mr Murali-Krishnan denies the accusation of negligence and said it was ‘reasonable’ to downgrade her case with the information he was given. He said because of the aggressive form of cancer Miss Maytum suffers from, the delay in her treatment has made no difference to her eventual terminal illness. He admits negligence in failing to tell her GP about the downgrading of her case and in not arranging for her case to be reviewed within three months. The court hearing was told Mr Murali-Krishnan and two other surgeons at the hospital have now changed their policy to meet national guidelines. It also heard that Miss Maytum would have been seen within two weeks if she had lived in England rather than in Wales. Mr Poole told Mr Murali-Krishnan: ‘A woman of Miss Maytum’s age with a discrete breast lump which had persisted for six weeks, referred on an urgent basis by her GP - certainly in England, that woman would expect to be seen in two weeks. ‘But at your hospital it was five-and-a-half months and you were happy for her to wait this long with a lump in her breast.’ Mr Murali-Krishnan said: ‘This is a hospital policy which I have to follow.’ The surgeon told the hearing he ‘definitely’ would have changed the referral back to urgent if he had received a letter or telephone call from the GP who initially referred her saying how concerned he was. But the hearing has been told Miss Maytum’s GP was never made aware his patient had been downgraded against all national guidelines. The hearing continues.

"British Gas executives splashed £25,000 on a 'boozy knees-up' at a luxury hotel prior to making 158 staff redundant, it was revealed today. Workers were sent to a training event at the Belfry near Oxford and in return enjoyed a three-course meal with wine. The 140 delegates were also handed a £100-a-night room each at the event organised by British Gas' new commercial director Richard Marriott. Big bash: British Gas spent £25,000 on a training day and party at the Oxford Belfry weeks before more than 150 staff were made redundant . Having fun: Delegates also enjoyed a night's stay in a £100-a-night room after a three-course meal with wine . But it has emerged that weeks after the event at Thame in Oxfordshire, 158 staff lost their jobs, including in nearby Oxford. Boss: Sam Laidlaw, Chief Executive of Centrica, is on £5million a year while British Gas put up prices by up to nine per cent . On disgruntled worker, who is out of a job, told The Sun: 'It's disgusting — this man throws a boozy knees-up to impress his new staff, then a few weeks later more than 150 people lose their jobs.' British Gas has been widely panned for its spending while people struggle to pay their heating bills. A spokesman for the National Pensioners Convention said the latest scandal 'shows how completely divorced they are from the reality'. Sam Laidlaw, boss of Centrica, which owns the business, earns £5million while  it hiked dual fuel prices by an average 9.2 per cent in November. After confirming the latest job losses in Leicester and Oxford a spokesman said: 'We work hard to improve the service we offer our customers, and this means regular training for our staff, sometimes involving an overnight stay. 'None of the employees who attended this training event is affected by the redundancy programme. 'We’re fully supporting all those employees whose jobs may be at risk, and will consider their suitability for 160 new jobs British Gas is creating in Leicester.' In December flush British Gas splurged £10,000 on a festive Alton Towers 'jolly' for staff in charge of cutting off customers who cannot afford to pay their bills. Training: Last year British Gas sent 80 people from their debt team to Alton Towers (pictured) to learn how to cope with customers irate about the energy giant's 9.2% price hike . Warrant officers - who can break into homes to shut off the power - were sent to the Staffordshire theme park to learn how to cope with irate customers after the energy giant's 9.2 per cent price hike.

"Time columnist and CNN TV host Fareed Zakaria has been suspended from both news organizations for plagiarizing an article in magazine the New Yorker. Zakaria, who writes and serves as editor-at-large for Time magazine, apologized after several paragraphs were found lifted from an article published in the New Yorker for use in his Time column. Both Time and CNN, who also noticed similarities in a blog post he wrote for their website, have suspended him for a month. Plagiarizing: Columnist and TV host Fareed Zakaria has been suspended from Time magazine and CNN for plagiarism . Zakaria said in a statement on Friday he made 'a terrible mistake,' adding: 'It is a serious lapse and one that is entirely my fault.' CNN’s choice to suspend their foreign-affairs anchor and the face to their programme ‘GPS’ acknowledged a similar article he wrote for CNN.com using the same material lifted from New Yorker writer Jill Lepore’s piece published in April. 'He wrote a shorter blog post on CNN.com on the same issue which included similar unattributed excerpts. That blog post has been removed and CNN has suspended Fareed Zakaria while this matter is under review,' CNN stated. In a separate statement, Time spokesman Ali Zelenko said the magazine accepts Zakaria's apology, but would suspend his column for one month, 'pending further review.' Apology: Zakaria, who hosts his own programme on CNN, apologized for his actions after an article written for Time and CNN.com showed pieces lifted from a New Yorker magazine article . 'What he did violates our own standards for our columnists, which is that their work must not only be factual but original; their views must not only be their own but their words as well,' Zelenko said. Media reporters had previously noted similarities between passages in Zakaria's column about gun control that appeared in Time's Aug. 20 issue as well. In Zakaria's column, titled 'The Case for Gun Control,' he began one paragraph with the sentences: . 'Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at UCLA, documents the actual history in `Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.' Guns were regulated in the U.S. from the earliest years of the Republic.' A corresponding passage in Lenore's essay, titled 'Battleground America,' begins: ‘As Adam Winkler, a constitutional-law scholar at U.C.L.A., demonstrates in a remarkably nuanced new book, `Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,' firearms have been regulated in the United States from the start.' In Zakaria's statement, he apologized 'unreservedly' to Lepore, as well as to his editors and readers. Zakaria also serves as a Washington Post columnist.","Passages in column written by Zakaria for Time magazine and CNN found lifted from the New Yorker .

"A Texas university professor is adjusting to life in a dumpster as he studies whether people are happier living a simpler lifestyle. Dr. Jeff Wilson, a Harvard-educated environmental science professor, has now been housed in the 36-square-foot container for more than nine months. He may even continue living in the dumpster for another year if he feels like continuing with the much simpler life - which he claims to prefer. Scroll down for video . Professor Jeff Wilson has been living in this dumpster for seven months now and says he may yet stay for another year . The dumpster was large enough to fit a bed and a few pieces of Mr Wilson's (pictured) furniture . But it was just an empty barren space before he filled it with his possessions . Mr Wilson, who is dean of the University College at Huston-Tillotson in Texas,  said it has now been without its pitfalls. 'The most terrifying night was the second night. It was about 27 degrees interior temperature and exactly 4:01 a.m., the trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors, a bit of a shock,' Wilson told ABC13. He added the toughest part of his challenge was dealing with the temperature inside the dumpster. The heat hit 45C in the summer and reaches -5C in the winter. Having now built temperature controls, though, he said he is focusing on communicating the design aspect of the project. Wilson posted a picture of him and his girlfriend (pictured) with the comment, 'Honey, I'm home. This place looks like a dump' just before he moved in earlier this year . Wilson is moving through different stages. Phase I, which launched on February 4, 2014, included living with no amenities, including sourcing water from Lady Bird Lake, according to his website. Phase II of the experiment will include a connection to the electrical grid, household appliances, and most amenities found in a modern home. Phase III of the experiment, dubbed 'The Über Dumpster,' will launch in the spring of 2015. Phase III aims to combine the best aspects of the first two phases so that all the amenities of modern life will be included, operating with the smallest ecological footprint possible. Professor Jeff Wilson (left) holds a PhD in Environmental Science, while pictured right is the storage space below the dumpster which contains his belongings . Mr Wilson's bed and living space inside the dumpster. He admits managing the toilet smells can be an issue . Maintaining a comfortable temperature was initially a problem until Mr Wilson built temperature controls . Designs may include solar power generation, a composting toilet, a flat screen television, and a passive-solar heated shower . 'I'm not as concerned about the shower,' he told The Atlantic, 'but getting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run.' Currently, he uses facilities at the university's gym, but a toilet and shower will soon connect to the dumpster externally. 'You don't really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,' he explained. After the year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the United States, educating students about the possibility of following in his 'less is more' footsteps. Wilson said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at Starbucks. 'I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster,' he told Fast Company. So when the lease ran out on his lovely, full-sized, apartment a year later, he posted an announcement on Facebook, which read: 'Starting at 6pm, I will be selling all of my home furnishings, clothes, kitchen appliances, and everything else in the apartment for $1 an item.' Despite, the five-item-per-person maximum, his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase, which was coming with him to the dumpster. However, the dumpster wasn't ready at that stage, so he moved into his office for the next seven months, secretly sleeping on the floor until he moved in, in Feburary. 'Keeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,' he told the website. He said: 'We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life. 'Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing. 'This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.'","Professor Jeff Wilson has been living in a dumpster for past nine months .

"The first full-scale tidal generator in Wales has been unveiled in an attempt to reduce the UK's carbon emissions. The device, an underwater turbine mounted on a free-standing base, will be installed in Ramsey Sound, Pembrokeshire. Its backers say it will be among the world's first demonstration devices connected to the grid to generate green, renewable and predictable tidal power. Scroll down for video . The first full-scale tidal generator in Wales, which could produce power for 10,000 homes, has been unveiled . Enery generated by the 400kW demonstration device, which will be installed within weeks, will be used to power 100 nearby homes. After a 12-month testing period, up to nine tidal devices will be installed off St Davids Head in Pembrokeshire to form a 10 megawatt array. The DeltaStream device, developed by Tidal Energy (TEL) weighs 150 tonnes, and has a 52ft by 66ft (16 metre by 20 metre) frame. Cardiff-based Tidal Energy claims its tidal generator is at the cutting edge of green technology, with three separate horizontal axis turbines mounted on a common triangular frame. Cardiff-based . Tidal Energy claims its tidal generator is at the cutting edge of green . technology, with three separate horizontal axis turbines mounted on a . common triangular frame. Each turbine has a 49ft (15 metre) diameter . rotor which is connected to a generator to produce electricity both the . ebb and flood tides . The DeltaStream device developed by tidal stream technology company Tidal Energy will be among the world's first demonstration devices connected to the grid to generate green, renewable and predictable tidal power . Each turbine has a 49ft (15 metre) diameter rotor which is connected to a generator to produce electricity both the ebb and flood tides. It does not require expensive drilling into the seabed, the company claims, and has features to minimise impacts on the environment. 'The imminent launch of DeltaStream, and the supply chain that now exists as a consequence of its development, marks the birth of the tidal industry in Wales,' said Tidal Energy's managing director Martin Murphy. 'We remain committed to leading the expansion of the industry and to the creation of green jobs by building on the wealth of expertise present in the UK and the country's plentiful resources.' The  DeltaStream tidal turbine will be installed in Ramsey Sound in Pembrokeshire on the Welsh coast . Strong tides and crashing waves can produce huge amounts of energy – and the UK, with its long coastlines, is in an ideal position to harness this power. Tidal Energy received £8 million funding for the project from the European Regional Development Fund, and match-funded by majority shareholder Welsh renewables company Eco2, which will join forces with TEL to install the further devices. Renewable Energy Association chief executive Dr Nina Skorupska said: 'Many of our ocean energy members are currently racing to deploy the first wave or tidal farm, with several of these types of devices instead of just one. 'When that happens the sector will move into mass production, costs will fall dramatically, and wave and tidal will be well on their way to becoming major players in the UK energy system.' Overall, the marine energy industry has been forecast to be worth £6.1 billion ($10.3 billion) to the UK economy by 2035, creating nearly 20,000 jobs. In February, plans were submitted to develop the world's first tidal lagoon energy project in the UK. The project could provide renewable power for 120,000 homes in Swansea, Wales for 120 years. Developers behind the  Swansea Bay project believe it could be the first step in developing lagoon technology that could meet 10 per cent of the UK's electricity needs from the tide. The scheme would involve a six-mile (9.5km) wall built around Swansea Bay, which would create a lagoon in the Severn Estuary with turbines that could harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day. If it gets the go-ahead, the lagoon could be the first of a series of five developments around the UK, coast which could generate as much as 10 per cent of the UK's electricity by 2023. Tidal Lagoon Power, the company behind the project, said it hopes that 65 per cent of expenditure will be in the UK, boosting a home grown supply chain and creating a possible future export market.","The first device will be installed in Ramsey Sound, Pembrokeshire .

"MI5's Andrew Parker briefed the PM about a reluctance among internet firms to cooperate with tracking terrorists . David Cameron has been warned by the country’s top spy chiefs that internet companies including Facebook and Google are undermining national security. The Prime Minister was told internet giants have ‘withdrawn’ their cooperation and are obstructing MI5 requests for help tracking terrorists and major criminals, including paedophiles. It follows fugitive Edward Snowden’s claims that the firms are used to snoop on British citizens, which is disputed by spy chiefs. Before the US whistleblower’s disclosures, they willingly responded to lawful requests for details of phone calls, emails, text messages and other private information. Now the companies are said to be concerned about being seen to acquiesce too easily. One of the fears is that intelligence officers will lose the ability to monitor the safety threat posed by British jihadists travelling to Syria, for example Londoner Mohammed El Araj, 23, who is said to have died while fighting for militants with links to Al Qaeda. A security source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘One of the impacts of the Snowden disclosures is that internet companies have withdrawn their willing  co-operation and that has affected some operations.’ The source added that a key bone of contention was the internet service providers’ unwillingness to hand over encryption keys that unlock data being sought by law enforcement agencies. The source added: ‘It is not simply about terrorism; it’s about serious crime, including paedophiles and gangland crime bosses.’ Now Mr Cameron has been briefed by Sir Iain Lobban, head of the Government’s intelligence gathering operation GCHQ, and Andrew Parker, director general of MI5. According to a report, more than 500,000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) requests for data were made to communication service companies last year. Facebook rejects a third of requests made by UK law enforcement authorities and other agencies, while Yahoo turns down a quarter. And despite pressure from Home Secretary Theresa May, Yahoo is moving its entire operation to Dublin, beyond the scrutiny of British surveillance laws. If others follow, it is feared the country will be left even more dangerously exposed. Jihadists in Syria including Mohammed El Araj from west London . Ministers have already been told that the thousands of top-secret files stolen by Snowden and published in the Guardian, have caused massive damage to Britain’s intelligence capability. The source said that it is vital that internet companies help police and security services  to stay one step ahead of their targets in a rapidly changing digital world. Under existing arrangements, police and intelligence agencies use RIPA to request crucial data and wiretaps. But requests are being rejected or sent back for further consideration, even in the case of Home Secretary-approved warrants. Access to data has proved essential in thwarting terrorist atrocities and organised crime. In 2007 police and MI5 foiled an Al Qaeda plot to kidnap, torture and behead a British Muslim soldier. Telephone taps and internet surveillance played a crucial role in jailing five men. And in 2012 paedophile John Maber, 47, who shared online footage of his rape of a child, was jailed after police intercepted an internet offer he made to abuse a child over a webcam. MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It’s right that internet companies take great care in how they handle their users’ personal information and who has access to it . John Maber, 47, who shared online footage of his rape on a child, was jailed after police intercepted an internet offer he made over a webcam . ‘But people will clearly expect them to co-operate with the police and others when it comes to tackling matters like serious crime or the dreadful scourge of online paedophilia. ‘And they will be rightly  concerned if the police and intelligence agencies are facing unnecessary difficulties and delays.’ In its most recent government requests report Facebook stated: ‘We respond to valid requests relating to criminal cases. Each and every request we receive is checked for legal sufficiency and we reject or require greater specificity on requests that are overly broad or vague.’ Yahoo said: ‘We carefully review Government Data Requests for legal sufficiency and interpret them narrowly in an effort to produce the least amount of data necessary to comply with the request.’ Google declined to comment directly on the claims but it is understood to follow a policy  of fully scrutinising every incoming request. The Internet Service Providers Association said its members were ‘understandably cautious’ about handing over data but that none of the companies wanted to break the law. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Government is committed to ensuring that law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the powers they need to investigate crime, protect the public and safeguard national security.’","Cameron told internet giants have withdrawn cooperation with MI5 .

Scroll down for video . Arrest: Justin Carter could faces up to ten years in prison for joking about carrying out a school massacre . 'These people are serious. They really want my son to go away to jail for a sarcastic comment that he made,' Justin's father, Jack Carter, said. Although the teenager, who turned 19 while in prison, added 'lol' (laughing out loud) and 'jk' (just kidding) to his post, a woman from Canada who saw it reported Justin to police after finding out that he lived near an elementary school. Mr Carter is now campaigning to have his son released, and wants to teach teenagers about the dangers of posting comments on social media. 'Justin was the kind of kid who didn't . read the newspaper. He didn't watch television. He wasn't aware of . current events. These kids, they don't realize what they're doing. They . don't understand the implications.

"Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that the American government should deport thousands of children who cross the border illegally into the United States. Pressed by Christiane Amanpour during a televised CNN town hall event, the former secretary of state and possible 2016 presidential candidate bucked her political party by insisting that letting unaccompanied minors remain in the U.S. is the wrong policy to embrace. 'They should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are,' Clinton said, 'because – there are concerns about whether all of them can be sent back, but I think all of them that can be should be reunited with their families.' Moments later, Clinton articulated a bottom-line policy that disagrees sharply with President Obama's observable priorities. 'We have to send a clear message: Just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay,' Clinton said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tough love: Clinton said the US should send unaccompanied illegal immigrant children back to their home countries . The former secretary of state participated in an hour-long 'town hall' meeting on CNN . Packed in: The surge in numbers of unaccompanied children arriving has put pressure on the centers . 'So we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws, or we'll encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.' She acknowledged that 'it may be safer' for children for violence-prone nations like El Salvador and Guatemala to remain stateside, 'but that's not the answer.' Clinton also said that the U.S. should help Mexico secure its own southern border, which abuts Guatemala and Belize, as a way to prevent under-18s from making the trip to America. But 'first of all,' she cautioned. 'we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide. We have children 5 and 6 years old who have come up from Central America.' The CNN audience, gathered at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., was hushed as Clinton outlined a policy that she hinted she would implement if she were . president. Many of her other pronouncements drew wild applause from what appeared to be a partisan crowd that CNN hand-picked for the occasion. She tried to dodge the question at first with claims that she had worked as secretary of state 'to deal with the violence in this region, to deal with border security.' But Amanpour pressed her three times for an answer. Through its budget for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Obama administration has tacitly acknowledged that the problem is growing quickly. In 2011 HHS took custody of 6,775 children who entered the country illegally without accompanying parents. That . number was 13,625 in 2012 and 24,668 in 2013. The government's budget . for 2014 provided for 60,000 such young border-crossers, but most . estimates far exceed that anticipated number. National shame: Hundreds of children are turning themselves in every week along the Arizona, Texas and New Mexico borders, knowing that they will be processed and then allowed to stay in the United States while their immigration cases are sorted out . The federal government will spend more than $1 billion this year feeding, clothing and otherwise babysitting the children until suitable adult guardians can be found. HHS claims 85 per cent of them are reunited with family members, but those are guardians in the United States, not in their home countries. The agency has not responded to requests for information about how many of them are themselves illegal aliens. Few of the children are expected to return to face immigration judges, according to the nation's largest border patrolman's union. In 2012 President Obama announced a policy intended to delay the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S> as children before 2007. But in a transnational game of 'telephone,' that policy has been misinterpreted – in some cases willfully so, by 'coyotes' who make a living secretly transporting immigrants into the U.S. – to suggest that it would apply equally to newly arriving minors.","Hillary Clinton stunned a CNN audience on Tuesday by saying that the US should deport thousands of unaccompanied minors who have flooded the American border .

"Bruce Guthrie, policy advisor for Graduate Careers Australia, said dentists have been the highest paid graduates in Australia for 30 years . If you want to earn the highest wage when you finish university doing a degree in dentistry is the best way to do it, according to new statistics. The research carried out by Graduate Careers Australia reveals that careers in the medical industry are the best paid. Graduate dentists can expect to earn up to $80,000 when finishing university and optometry graduates can fetch up to $70,000. Engineers can command around $64,000 while those working in medicine can get around $60,000 a year. Bruce Guthrie, policy advisor for Graduate Careers Australia told Daily Mail Australia: 'These statistics are not that surprising because dentistry has been the best paid graduate career in Australia for the last 30 years. 'I have been doing these statistics since the 1980's and the big changes we have seen are the wages for science graduates increasing. 'These are people who are affected by mining booms and their wages have improved notably over the years. 'We track the salaries of people three years on and they can grow up to 60 per cent, the outlook can completely changes. 'These figures are taken four months after they have finished their degree. 'Since the GFC we have seen it taking graduates longer to find jobs and  a lot of them are taking non graduate level jobs. 'Graduate numbers are small in the dentistry industry and it's a high paying field, dentists are very high earners and its supply and demand. 'More experienced people in the field will get paid a lot more. Australian dentistry graduates command the best wages of $80,000 a year when they finish university . This is the list of graduate pay compiled by Graduate Careers Australia showing the careers . Mr Guthrie says the science professions have seen the biggest wage hikes in recent years in Australia . 'We always tell people that what you get paid is just a small part of the information you should take into consideration when doing a degree. 'It's no use choosing a dentistry degree if your heart lies in English Literature, these figures are informative and they shouldn't play a huge role in people's selection of degrees. Sarah Macartney, a spokesman for Seek, told Daily Mail Australia that graduate pay was all about supply and demand and those with a skills shortage can command a higher salary. 'Roles that have spent a lot of time at university are naturally going to command higher salaries and that is true of the medical industry and for dentists, high remuneration comes with skills. Optometrists can earn $70,000 while engineers can command about $64,000 . Pharmacists only start on around $38,000 after they finish university because they have to carry out another year of training . 'Sometimes there are misconceptions that say lawyers, people with professional skills, get paid a lot but it's not always the case, it takes a lot of hard work.' Dan Purchas, a director at Graduate Careers, told Daily Mail Australia, that careers in engineering and investment banking were also very highly paid. He said: 'We would generally say to graduates for the best pay to join a graduate programme. It can be good and graduates need to apply between February and April for the following year. 'Technology degrees are missing from the market at the moment, there are not enough of them and for the number of people who are looking for them. 'Computer science degrees for example can see a starting wage of $65,000 and some of the bigger companies can offer higher starting brackets if they are more aggressive.'","Dentistry graduates command the best wages of $80,000 a year .

"The SAS are being issued with new ammunition designed to kill the enemy outright after they condemned a ‘shoot-to-wound’ policy that put their lives at risk. The elite troops will now use bigger, heavier rounds to overcome Islamic insurgents who are determined to fight to the death. The bullets upgrade – and a new range of rifles designed to fire them – were recommended in a top-secret report on SAS operations in Afghanistan. It called for a return to a ‘shoot-to-kill’ policy and for heavier rounds to be issued to troops. The report’s authors described bloody clashes with Taliban jihadists who managed to ignore their bullet wounds and carry on shooting. On target: US Navy Seals use the powerful SCAR-H rifle which are designed to kill the enemy outright . The rounds currently issued as standard to SAS troops for their rifles are 5.56 mm calibre. In future, the troopers will be given 7.62 mm rounds – which are almost twice as heavy and designed to kill with a single shot. Last night, a regiment insider said: ‘The shoot-to-wound policy was based on the assumption that once he was wounded an enemy combatant would stop fighting, and so would his comrades to give him first aid. ‘But this backfired against the Taliban. The 5.56 mm rounds did not take a big enough chunk out of them, allowing fanatical insurgents to keep on fighting despite their wounds. As a result, more SAS soldiers were shot and badly wounded. ‘The need for a heavier round was highlighted in the regiment’s post-Afghanistan report. Tests are now taking place on at least three rifles specially designed to fire the 7.62 mm rounds. ‘The difference in killing power between 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm is startling – the heavier rounds pack so much more of a punch.’ Rifles being tested at the SAS’s ranges in Hereford include the US-made Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle (Heavy) Mk17 – known as the SCAR-H. It fires 7.62 mm rounds from a newly designed magazine that holds 20 rounds. Accurate: Prince Harry with his SA80 rifle in Afghanistan . Powerful: The SCAR-H rifle fires 7.62mm rounds from a newly designed magazine that holds 20 rounds . Different length barrels are available for close-quarters battle and for longer-range engagements. The rifle is already being used by United States Special Forces units, including US Navy Seals, who participated in the mission to eliminate Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011. The best-performing rifle of those being assessed by the SAS will replace the regiment’s current standard issue weapon – the Canadian-manufactured Diemaco C8, which fires a 5.56 mm round and uses the standard Nato 30-round magazine. According to military experts, the C8 is a versatile weapon that can be fitted with a variety of scopes and aiming devices. Other attachments include an underslung 40 mm grenade launcher. The problem of 5.56 mm rounds lacking killing power in firefights is worse because the Taliban use 7.62 mm rounds in their AK-47 Kalashnikovs and Russian sniper rifles. The SAS’s report said the 7.62 mm rounds flew farther and with greater accuracy – giving the enemy a distinct advantage, especially in long-range engagements. The bullets upgrade was recommended in a report on SAS (badge pictured) operations in Afghanistan . The only advantage to the 5.56 mm rounds is that, given their lighter weight, soldiers can carry more of them. Manufactured by BAE Systems in Crewe, they have a steel tip and core. The bullets are also lead-free to reduce environmental pollution. BAE has a £2 billion contract with the Ministry of Defence to produce these ‘ethical rounds’. Tory MP Patrick Mercer, a former Army commander, said: ‘The 7.62 mm round is a good, meaty bullet and will drop your enemy with a single hit. The 5.56 mm cannot compete with it for stopping power and, according to many soldiers, the round has fallen short in Iraq and Afghanistan. ‘Insurgents who would have been fatally wounded by a 7.62 mm have been able to continue fighting and endanger the lives of our soldiers. ‘This is a positive step and I hope other regiments give consideration to returning to 7.62 mm rounds in the infantryman’s standard rifle. It could save lives and win battles.’ The MoD said: ‘Our troops in Afghanistan use a variety of highly effective weapons that fire a range of ammunition. They primarily use 5.56 mm rounds fired from the world-class SA80 A2 assault rifle and these have great power and accuracy. ‘For longer-range firefights, troops can use the general purpose machine gun, grenade machine gun, light machine gun and the 7.62 mm longer-range sharpshooter rifle.’ l SAILORS on ships and submarines are to be breathalysed to curb a culture of ‘binge drinking’. The move follows the fatal shooting  of Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux, 36, on nuclear submarine HMS Astute in 2011 by drunk Able Seaman Ryan Donovan.","Bullets upgrade recommended in top-secret report on SAS operations .

"Siem de Jong will be invited into John Carver’s backroom team at Newcastle with the forward almost certain to miss the rest of the season following surgery on a collapsed lung. The Magpies have backtracked on their initial estimate that the 26-year-old would be missing for eight weeks. Instead, it now appears likely that De Jong will only make a return to competitive action next season after Carver admitted there was no timescale on his recovery. Siem de Jong has only played two Premier League games for Newcastle since joining from Ajax . De Jong (left) was signed by Alan Pardew in the summer, but has struggled with injuries this season . The former Ajax captain will visit United’s training ground for the first time on Friday following last week’s operation. And Carver will ask De Jong to play a behind-the-scenes role during his rehabilitation. He explained: ‘We did something similar with Ryan Taylor when he was injured and he did some scouting. But with Siem I might ask him to come in and watch the Under-21s or the youth team and give me some feedback. ‘I want to make him feel part of the club because I think he's a little bit frustrated.’ De Jong’s frustration comes from a series of injuries which have limited his Premier League starts this season to just one. He picked up a calf problem in pre-season and suffered a torn thigh muscle in September. The £6million summer signing was due to make his comeback at Crystal Palace last week when he was diagnosed with a collapsed lung for the second time. John Carver now looks set to offer the attacking midfielder a behind-the-scenes role while he recovers . De Jong captained Ajax, the club he had been at since youth level, before joining Newcastle in July . And Carver added: ‘He's come here with a big reputation and he's not been able to get on the pitch and give something to the fans. ‘He got so close and then it's like chopping his legs away. So if can use him around the place I'd be mad not to.’ De Jong first suffered a collapsed lung at the beginning of last season with Ajax but his recent surgery is thought to have corrected the weakness, although it is not known when he will be strong enough to resume training. ‘I haven’t put a timeline on his return,’ said Carver. ‘The most important thing is how he feels. This was a big operation he had. So it’s really in his hands. We won’t force him before he is ready to come back. ‘But he’s such a positive guy he might be back quicker than anyone expects.’ Meanwhile, Newcastle will learn on Friday if midfielder Cheick Tiote’s season is over. He picked up a knee injury playing for Ivory Coast during the Africa Cup of Nations and it is feared he will miss the remainder of the campaign. United are not happy that their player has returned with a injury and could now take further action if tests reveal serious damage.","Newcastle forward Siem de Jong has surgery on a collapsed lung last week .

"Astronomers have discovered an exoplanet with the longest known year - 704 days. The planet, Kepler-421b, takes almost two Earth years to circle its star. In comparison, Mars orbits our sun once every 780 days. Most of the 1,800-plus exoplanets discovered to date are much closer to their stars and have much shorter orbital periods, astronomers claim. It takes Kepler-421b (illustration pictured) circles almost two Earth years to circle its star - or 704 days. Kepler-421b orbits an orange type K star that is cooler and dimmer than our sun . 'Finding Kepler-421b was a stroke of luck,' said lead author David Kipping of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Massachusetts. 'The farther a planet is from its star, the less likely it is to transit the star from Earth's point of view. It has to line up just right.' Kepler-421b orbits an orange, type K star that is cooler and dimmer than our sun. It circles the star at a distance of about 110 million miles. As a result, this Uranus-sized planet is chilled to a temperature of -93°C (-135° F). As the name implies, Kepler-421b was discovered using data from Nasa Kepler spacecraft (illustration pictured). The spacecraft stared at the same patch of sky for four years, watching for stars that dim as planets cross in front of them .

As a result, this Uranus-sized planet is chilled to a temperature of -93°C (-135° F). It the first example of a potentially non-migrating gas giant in a transiting system that astronomers have found. Despite its patience, Kepler only detected two transits of Kepler-421b due to that world's extremely long orbital period. The planet's orbit places it beyond the 'snow line' - the dividing line between rocky and gas planets. Outside of the snow line, water condenses into ice grains that stick together to build gas giant planets. 'The snow line is a crucial distance in planet formation theory. 'We think all gas giants must have formed beyond this distance,' explained Professor Kipping. Since gas giant planets can be found extremely close to their stars, in orbits lasting days or even hours, theorists believe that many exoplanets migrate inward early in their history. Kepler-421b shows that such migration isn't necessary. It could have formed right where it can now be seen. 'This is the first example of a potentially non-migrating gas giant in a transiting system that we've found,' continued Professor Kipping. The host star, Kepler-421, is located about 1,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Lyra. The Kepler probe was launched in 2009. To find the latest planet, spacecraft stared at the same patch of sky for four years, watching for stars that dim as planets cross in front of them .","Kepler-421b was discovered using data from the Nasa Kepler spacecraft .

Rob McGee was watching the storm roll over Newcastle - two hours north of Sydney - when he captured the moment a lightning strike hit a nearby gym . 'Scared the crap out of me!' he wrote along with the video. In the five-second footage, a deafening crack is heard when lightning hits a building. Mr McGee told shocked friends who commented on the post that the landing place was a gym behind Civic train station. 'Had a better look..... it is gym behind the station. Bet a few people dropped a weight or two,' he wrote. The landing place was a nearby gym behind Civic train station in Newcastle . The storm that rolled in over NSW on Sunday followed hot weather during the day . He added 'a few' others had hit his building but this was the only one he had captured on camera. At the time of publication, Mr McGees' video had attracted almost 70,000 views on social media. Sunday's hot weather during the day was followed by thunderstorms late in the afternoon. In NSW, a number of fires were believed to have been started by lightning strikes. At least 90 blazes were burning across the state, with more than half deemed out-of-control. Most were caused by lightning strikes late Sunday that followed scorching temperatures in Sydney and around the state, NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman Ben Shepherd said. At the time of publication, Mr McGees' video had attracted almost 70,000 views on social media . 'The good thing at this stage is there is nothing impacting on any lives or property,' he told AAP on Monday. 'However, given the remoteness of some of these fires, it is going to take a considerable effort over coming days in order to actually start some containment on a number of these fires.' Mr Shepherd said the RFS had sent out planes on Monday morning to try to detect new outbreaks. 'We are expecting more [fires],' he said. About 430 firefighters were on the ground and more are on standby. 'We've probably got a day or two at least of more favourable weather, which will assist in getting some of these fires under control,' Mr Shepherd said. Sydney was set to reach a top of 30 degrees Celsius on Monday while Wallsend, in the Hunter region, was expected to peak at 38, and Penrith in Sydney's west had a maximum of 36.

"A collection of six Messerschmitts which appeared in the epic war film Battle of Britain almost 50 years ago have sold for an estimated £4million after sitting 'forgotten' in a hanger for decades. The six single-engine fighters - Spanish-built versions based on the famous BF 109 model that fought with the RAF's iconic Spitfires and Hurricanes in the aerial battle over Southern England in 1940 - were found stored in a dusty hangar in Texas, U.S., earlier this year. The rare planes were used in the classic 1969 war epic that starred a host of international stars including Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier, Trevor Howard, Christopher Plummer and Kenneth Moore. Scroll down for video . The Messerschmitts have been sold in a multi-million pound deal after sitting in a hangar in Texas for years . The rare aircraft were used in the classic 1969 war epic Battle of Britain and have sat unused for 40 years . The filmmakers bought 50 of the Messerschmitts - ironically fitted with the same Rolls Royce Merlin engine that powered the RAF's famous Spitfires and Hurricanes – to recreate the aerial dogfights. They also bought 32 Heinkels and 33 Spitfires and Hurricanes. After filming ended, the remaining Messerschmitts ended up with Texas oil billionaire and warbird enthusiast Wilson 'Connie' Edwards. The 80-year-old former movie stunt pilot was given the aircraft as payment for his work in the film. Now, after 40 years, he has sold the iconic planes to a Swiss company, which plans to restore two of the aircraft and sell the other four. The four to be sold will be offered to aviation restorers or museums – with experts predicting that a flying version today would be worth around £1.5million. Bf 109s like the ones sold were first built and tested during the Spanish Civil War in 1937 and 1938 in order to develop and improve them before the start of the Second World War. Historic aircraft restorer Tony Ditheridge, who runs Suffolk-based Hawker Restoration which has put more than a dozen Hurricanes back in the air, said: 'This is a remarkable collection - and the opportunity for someone to own an example of one of the most famous aircraft from World War Two. The six single-engine fighters are based on the famous BF 109 model that flew  over Southern England in 1940 . The planes were discovered in a dusty hangar in Texas in the U.S. earlier this year and have now been sold .

Maximum speed: 385mph at 22,640 feet . Ceiling: 37,895 feet . Range: 373 miles . Guns: 2 × 13 mm machine guns and 1 × 20 mm cannon . Bombs: 1 × 250 kg  bomb or 4 × 50 kg  bombs . 'The original versions of this type of Messerschmitt were flown in the Spanish Civil War and a genuine German WW2 model in restored condition would fetch more than £3.5million. 'The Messerschmitt was the most numerous production aircraft of its time and a pivotal part of the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain but very few survive. 'This version was pretty unpleasant to fly but there will be a lot of interest in these aircraft.' Swiss company Boschung Global Ltd. has acquired the six planes, which includes the only surviving factory two-seater Messerschmitt ME 109. Although the ME 109 is the world's most manufactured fighter plane, there are only a handful still in existence worldwide. Wilson 'Connie' Edwards, (right) sold the six Messerschmitts to Swiss company Boschung Global Ltd.

Company spokesman Paul Boschung said: 'The deal with former movie stunt pilot Wilson 'Connie' Edwards was certainly no ordinary sale. 'It took several months and, in many respects, was an incredibly interesting project. 'The transaction was carried out seamlessly thanks to the assistance of Platinum Fighter Sales, the leading specialists in the trade of Warbirds in the US.'

"A British birdwatcher enjoying a sunshine holiday in Portugal thought he was experiencing a case of deja vu when he captured a tiny bird. When Dave Clifton examined the identification ring on the leg of the blackcap he thought it bore an uncanny similarity to the one he had ringed weeks earlier. But that was 1,500 miles away close to his home Staffordshire and the chances of capturing the same bird twice are almost incalculable. When Dave Clifton examined the identification ring on the bird (pictured) he thought it bore an uncanny similarity to the one he had ringed weeks earlier - 1,500 miles away close to his home in Staffordshire . But after a quick phone call to his wife back home, who checked in his ringing book, he found he had pulled off the most amazing fluke. The coincidence was the talk of the twitching world yesterday with enthusiasts wondering whether a case like it had ever been recorded before. Last night Mr Clifton, 57, was unavailable for comment as the keen ornithologist was out birdwatching and ringing again with twitchers. But Colin McShane, 63, a fellow 'ringer' from the Brewood Ringers, said he had been completely bowled over by the freak coincidence. He said the group had travelled to Vilamoura in Portugal to join an international team catching migrating birds to check them for leg tags to see where they had flown from in Europe while making their way to Africa where they usually spend the winter. Mr McShane said ‘I extracted a male blackcap from one of our standard mist nets and was very pleased, although not too surprised, to find that it was carrying a British Trust for Ornithology ring. 'Back at the processing station, I read out the bird's ring number several times for accuracy.’ He said: ‘Dave went quiet, then he quickly got on the phone to his wife, who checked in his ringing book back home in Staffordshire. Mr Clifton had travelled with a group to Vilamoura in Portugal (pictured) to join a team catching migrating birds to check them for leg tags to see where they had flown from in Europe while making their way to Africa . ‘And Hey Presto - the bird was indeed one of two blackcaps he had ringed at Duckley Plantation, on the north shore of the Blithfield Reservoir in Staffordshire, on September 11 2014, a few weeks before we had left for Portugal.’ He said the rare coincidence was one of those once-in-a-lifetime occurrences and it left fellow birdwatchers completely stunned. ‘Unfortunately Dave wasn't able to buy a Lottery ticket on that day, but it must be a given that he was pretty certain of a big win with that kind of luck,’ he added. A distinctive greyish warbler the size of a sparrow, the male has a black cap and the female has a chestnut one and its distinctive fluting song has earned it the name 'northern nightingale'. According to experts, it is primarily a summer visitor to the UK, but birds from Germany and north-east Europe are increasingly spending the winter in the UK. An estimated half a billion birds, from huge eagles to tiny warblers, migrate from Europe and Asia to Africa in the autumn and fly back in the spring.","Dave Clifton had tagged the small bird near his Staffordshire home .

"The Top Gear team could find themselves in hot water again, this time in Canada, after they were spotted driving through the city of Vancouver without registration plates. Pictures showed a bright yellow Ford Raptor pick-up truck, apparently driven by presenter Jeremy Clarkson, as it made its way down Vancouver's Granville Street thoroughfare. It carried no registration plates and tonight, when asked by MailOnline, a sergeant in the Vancouver Police Department said: 'We would have to pull the driver over.' Scroll down for video . 'We would have to pull the driver over': A Ford Raptor apparently driven by Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson makes its way down Vancouver's Granville Street with no visible registration plate . Cruising: Vehicles driven by Clarkson and his team are seen outside the Sutton Place Hotel . Brand new: Clarkson stands by the bright yellow Ford Raptor, apparently without plates, in the car park of Vancouver International Airport, after the Top Gear team flew into Canada for their latest adventure . It could be the second number plate related gaffe by the Top Gear team in two months, after Clarkson sparked Argentine diplomatic fury by driving through the South American country in a Porsche registered 'H982 FKL'. The plates were thought by some to be a veiled reference to the Falklands War of 1982. But the BBC claims the vehicle was perfectly legal as it had what is known as a 'temporary operating permit' (TOP). Today Vancouver Police Sergeant Randy Fincham told MailOnline that all cars driving in the province of British Columbia had to have registration plates on their front and rear. The only exception is for cars given a TOP which, the policeman said, is a piece of paper usually in the back window. But after viewing these pictures of Clarkson's Ford Raptor driving through his city, Sergeant Fincham said: 'If we had pulled this vehicle over we would have cited it for not having a plate.' He added: 'We would have to pull the driver over, make sure he's not got the registration permit on his lap or in his glove box. It's got to be visible to the rear.' Big car for a big country: Clarkson takes a look at the Ford Raptor pick-up he seems set to be driving . Getting the shots: Members of the Top Gear production team film the presenter as he checks out the car . Full set up: The production team film a segment with proper shoulder-mounted cameras and lighting . Another big car: This black Chevrolet pick-up will apparently also appear in the forthcoming programme . If the Top Gear team had failed to register their cars for the road in Canada they could face a further $109 fine . Sergeant Fincham said the temporary operating permit is a fairly large sheet of paper and should be clearly visible, even in the tinted windows of the pick-up used by the Top Gear team. If they are stopped by Canadian police, the Top Gear team could face fines. For failing to display the registration 'you would potentially be cited for $109 under the motor vehicle act,' said Sergeant Fincham. 'If they don't have vehicle insurance [which they could not have if the vehicle was not properly registered] they could be cited for not having valid motor insurance which is $598.' If the Top Gear team had failed to register their cars for the road in Canada they could face a further $109 fine, Sergeant Fincham said. Such registration is a prerequisite for getting a car insured. However, a BBC spokesperson said: 'As a brand new vehicle, the car was being driven with a temporary operating permit which, as permitted by law, was displayed in the car's window. 'At all times the vehicle was insured, registered and road legal as per both US and Canadian law.' Famous: Clarkson and James May pose for a selfie with a female fan on their way through the airport . Pressing the flesh: Clarkson shakes hands with another fan while the first checks out her trophy photo . The apparent gaffe is merely the latest controversy for Top Gear, which has faced a string of accusations of poor taste and even racism in the past year, and indeed in previous years. Comedian Frankie Boyle, himself known for controversial opinions, went so far as to call Clarkson a 'cultural tumour' as he called for the presenter's dismissal from the BBC. The latest number plate controversy comes after Argentina's ambassador to the UK demanded an apology from the BBC after Clarkson drove through her country with a registration plate which apparently referred to the Falklands War. But BBC head of television refused to make an apology to Ambassador Alicia Castro and insisted the programme would be broadcast. In a letter to Ms Castro, Mr Cohen said: 'We will ensure that these programmes are a fair representation of what took place throughout their stay.' The apparent gaffe is merely the latest controversy for Top Gear, which has faced a string of accusations of poor taste and even racism in the past year. Pictured, Clarkson and May with production crew staff . Quick smoke: The presenters enjoy a cigarette outside the airport . Popular: Top Gear is shown throughout the world and its format has been copied internationally . Clarkson poses with a young fan as the cameras roll . He added: 'I am very aware that some have questioned whether the number plates were in some way a prank. 'I would like to reassure you again that nothing we have seen or read since the team returned supports the view that this was a deliberate act.' Mr Cohen also said 'the BBC was disturbed by the violence the team faced during their visit'. The Top Gear cast and crew had to flee the South American country after they were attacked by an angry mob, which Clarkson described as 'the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in.' Ms Castro was not the first diplomat to be upset by the long-running motoring show. In 2011, the BBC had to apologise to the Mexican ambassador over comments made by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond. May described Mexican food as 'like sick with cheese on it' and Clarkson predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because 'at the Mexican embassy, the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this (snores). They won’t complain, it’s fine.' In fact the Mexican ambassador, His Excellency Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza, did complain about the 'outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults' and the BBC was forced to say sorry.","Vancouver Police says licence plates or paper permits are mandatory .

"Decorated:  Former army driver Carl 'Bear' Randell-Eyre has taken to advertising himself on Twitter in a desperate effort to find work after he was turned down for a staggering 790 jobs . Scroll down for video . A talented ex-Army tank driver has taken to advertising himself on Twitter in a desperate bid to find work - after he was turned down for a staggering 790 jobs. Carl 'Bear' Randell-Eyre, 42, served with the Armed Forces for 23 years and commanded the world's biggest military vehicles during tours in Bosnia and Iraq. One of the nation's most skilled drivers, he has 26 driving licences for everything from 68-tonne Challenger tanks to helicopter recovery cranes and 32-tonne trucks. During his long service in 25 countries he risked his life recovering and fixing bombed out military vehicles while under enemy fire on the front line. But the father-of-one's qualifications with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers are not recognised for civilian driving jobs and he cannot afford to retrain. Employers have also told him he lacks experience in the civilian world. The former corporal is just four weeks from losing the rented home he shares with his partner Donna, and is begging for the chance to work via his GiveBearAJob Twitter page. Bear, from Chard, Somerset, who left the Army in August 2012, said: 'I have 26 licences, but very few civilian qualifications, and it costs money to get them. 'I think advertising myself on Twitter is good because so many people can see it, and reply, and I feel my need for a job gets more attention. 'I don't mind if the job is a distance away, I could work away in the week if necessary. 'Someone has to just give me that one chance to prove myself. 'I'm nothing special, but I'm a grafter and give everything I have - 100 per cent.' Bear - a nickname given to him because he is 6ft 4ins and 22 stones - joined the army straight from school. He collected nine service medals from Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo - including awards for long service and good conduct - before his contract ran out in August 2012. Well-qualified: The 43-year-old with his various advanced driving certificates, but despite this experience he cannot find work . Desperate: Bear has launched his own Twitter page to try to get himself a job before he and his family is evicted . Jam packed: His driving licence must be one of the fullest in the country and he can legally drive 26 different types of vehicle . He used his retraining allowance to take an advanced driving course and got a temp job test-driving for Jaguar Land Rover which only lasted 13 weeks. Long-serving: Mr' Randell-Eyre served with the Armed Forces for 23 years, but cannot drive a HGV because he cannot afford the training costs . After that he spent every day applying for an impressive 528 jobs before he secured a chauffeuring job in April last year, which only lasted until September. In the last five months he has applied for a further 262 positions, trawling websites, job centres and using recruitment agencies. But despite commanding the biggest vehicles in the Forces he is not qualified to drive an HGV and can not afford the £3,000 training costs. He says he has applied for everything from delivery jobs to car mechanic roles, but employers tell him despite his military experience, he has no civilian practice to back it up. Bear, who also worked in Germany, Canada, Poland, and Macedonia, said: 'They will say things like you don't have any point to point pick up experience for a delivery job - but I have recovered tanks and dropped them back at the base. Surely that counts? 'It has got to the point now that we only have a months worth of rent left before me and Donna will have to move into my van. 'I'm ready to work and I'll do pretty much anything.' Out of luck: The driver says he is suffering because of the lack of a job, adding: 'I'm ready to work and I'll do pretty much anything' Varied: A motorcyle and Army lorry driven by Bear.

"Message: Leading head teacher Nigel Lashbrook has said that students must learn to break the rules . Schoolchildren must become rebels to ensure Britain  produces independent thinkers, the head teacher of a leading private school has said. Nigel Lashbrook from the £30,000-a-year Oakham School in Rutland said that students must learn to break the rules like activists Rosa Parks and Emmeline Pankhurst. He also described the work of inventor James Dyson, Steve Jobs and Sir Richard Branson as examples of how people successfully challenged the rules of business. His school has run a 'rules and rebellion' week where students were encouraged to do the same. Oxford-educated Mr Lashbrook described how the Suffragette movement in Britain and the civil rights movement in the Unites States are proof of how people can change history by breaking rules. He said: 'There are well-cited examples of acts of social rebellion, including Rosa Parks breaking the rules of segregation to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, becoming an icon of resistance to racial segregation. 'Or Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst, who rebelled against the legal and social norms of their day to fight for voting rights for women . 'Our schools rightly teach pupils about these momentous acts of rebellion. But do we do enough to teach those same students how they can, and should, stand up for what they believe?' His speech was part of a week of events at his school, which included a number of speakers. Philosopher Roger Scruton, fashion academic professor Amy de la Haye  and Jon Thompson, the Permanent Under Secretary responsible for the Ministry of Defence, spoke to students. Boarders also watched a selection of 'disruptive' films including The Breakfast Club and The Hunger Games. Prestigious: The £30,000-a-year Oakham School in Rutland has held a 'rules and rebellion' week . Inspiration: Mr Lashbrook told students Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and American civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks carried out great acts of rebellion and changed history as a result . Mr Lashbrook said: 'It is a fundamental part of any education to encourage pupils to have a strong moral compass, and to teach them to understand and abide by laws and regulations. 'But it is also our responsibility to give pupils the skills and the confidence to know when and how they should question the rules, the established conventions or social norms, and in some instances, the authority. 'We must all prepare students to be able to stand up for what they believe.

"Restaurant companies with 20 or more U.S. locations will have to post calorie counts for everything they sell beginning next year because of a little-noticed line buried deep inside the Obamacare law that some studies suggest could actually backfire. The rule, buried 455 pages inside the Affordable Care Act, was the brainchild of lawmakers who modeled the idea after a 2008 New York City law. Dr. Thomas Frieden, now the embattled helmsman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spearheaded the New York City law and guided it through a series of legal challenges, arguing that information – as the saying goes – is power. But after the Big Apple got a calorie sticker, researchers got a shock: New Yorkers eating at calorie-labeled restaurants consumer more calories than they had before the law took effect. The public health scientists compared meal receipts collected from McDonald's locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn with similar meal tickets scooped up from the same restaurants a year earlier. 'Posting calorie benchmarks had no direct impact, nor did it moderate the impact of calorie labels on food purchases,' they wrote in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH). And the menu labeling 'appeared to promote a slight increase in calorie intake.' SIMPLE: Chipotle has a small range of offerings and already posts calorie ranges in every restaurant – a plan that probably won't pass the FDA's muster but is well-positioned for expansion . NOT SO SIMPLE: Most traditional fast-food joints have a range of options, toppings and sauces whose potential unique combinations range into the tens of thousands . UNCHANGED: Only restaurant companies with 20 or more locations will have to comply, meaning that most mom-and-pop restaurants could be at a nutritional advantage . More than one in four New Yorkers said they saw the calorie-counts and let the numbers affect their choices, but the receipts told a different tale. The same researchers published a second finding in the journal Health Affairs: New York eaters took in more calories during the same period than restaurant patrons in nearby Newark, New Jersey – where there was no menu law. That's a sentiment shared by Chris Jackson, a Virginia businessman who told MailOnline at a Washington, D.C. steakhouse that he is better off not knowing how many calories are lurking in his dinner. 'The minute I have to stare at the numbers – what are they all, three digits? And I'm supposed to have a four-digit total? – everything on the menu is going to look doable. But you know, if I'm left to my own devices I tend to make the kind of choices I could explain to my wife with a straight face.' Sondra Jacobson at the next table, however, said the idea is one whose time 'is long overdue.' 'The loaf of bread in my kitchen has a calorie label,' Jackson said. 'They're on everything but my cigarettes, and what's the harm? Some people need that kind of information and maybe they should have it.' 'Just keep it off my dining room table and I'm fine,' she said. A man at her table who identified himself only as 'Jamie' and said he didn't want his last name in print because he works on Capitol Hill, said the menu labeling question was 'more about politics than science.' 'You have nutritionists on one side who want to be on your shoulder all the time like some caloric guardian angel,' he said, 'and you have the restaurants on the other wide who are trying to survive on razor-thin margins and, I think, reasonably, terrified that this will be the regulation that kills them.' The science side of the debate is decidedly mixed. An AJPH study unrelated to the first one, and about one-fourth as large, showed a modest decrease in calorie intake when eaters were shown calorie counts, but the dinners they ate ate weren't served in restaurants. 'If someone is going to serve you thousands of calories, the least they could do is tell you how many calories it has,' says nutrition activist Margo Wootan . A third research report published in Health Affairs looked at 1,000 minority and low-income New Yorkers, finding no effect at all. A fourth, by Drexel University researchers, found a modest impact in Philadelphia but was criticized because it compared restaurants in different neighborhoods. And a fifth found that Starbucks customers trimmed back their food calories by 14 per cent at locations where calorie counts were posted. Lattes and frappucinos, however, kept their appeal: There was no impact on the beverage sales that make up more than 95 per cent of Starbucks sales. According to the Food and Drug Administration, a typical American female should consumer no more than 2,000 calories. Men should top out at 2,400. And no meal, according to the government, should tip the scales at more than 800 calories. The FDA will soon require the display of total calories in every menu item to show up 'in a clear and conspicuous manner' along with 'a succinct statement concerning suggested daily caloric intake.' It's that second requirement that researchers in the first study thought might be confusing people. Carnegie Mellon University professor Julie Downs told Health24 last year that consumers might see a 550-calorie Big Mac alongside an 800-calorie meal recommendation, and then 'maybe feel OK to go ahead and get a slightly bigger main dish, but at the same time still get the same side dish and drink they would normally get.' 'And then all of a sudden they're up over 1,100 calories for the meal. Each one item may seem OK, but it adds up.' University of Alabama biostatistics professor Dr. David Allison, then president of the Obesity Society, told a court hearing a 2008 New York City menu labeling lawsuit that another avenue of backfire could be the 'forbidden-fruit allure of high-calorie foods.' DAMAGE CONTROL: McDonald's has experimented with food tray liners that play up its lower-calorie items, but hide the health cost of a Double Quarter Pounder . WAITING ON THE FDA: A final rule from the government could come any day now, and will likely bring menus like this McDonald's concept to every big chain restaurant in America . He added that customers who heed the posted calorie warnings and walk away less full would be more likely to gorge themselves on calories later the same day. 'What harms (if any) might result .... is difficult to predict,' he wrote. It's also difficult to know what will happen when Burger King has to disclose calorie counts but individual mom-and-pop restaurants won't. The debate over whether the idea works as intended – trimming America's waistline by sending fewer calories out of restaurant kitchens – has been over for four years despite the murky scientific picture. Frieden, then head of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, conceded to the New York Times in 2008 that . By 2009 state laws modeled after New York City's stretched from California to Maine and included nearly 20 county and city ordinances. One of those laws was in Oregon, where government scientists found 'small but meaningful reductions in calories bought' 18 months later, 'particularly among the 20 percent of patrons who see and use the labels.' The National Restaurant Association, among Washington, D.C.'s more powerful lobbies, opted in 2010 to embrace a national law that would let its member companies work from a single playbook instead of a patchwork quilt. But implementing the law is full of political maneuvering. NOT FAR ENOUGH: Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin and Connecticut Rep. Rosa Delauro, both Democrats, want the menu labeling rules expanded to include bowling alleys, theme parks and even putt-putt courses . COMING TO A THEATER NEAR YOU? Buttered popcorn labels could be devastating for cinema chains that make most of their revenue on food concessions . Margo Wootan, chief nutritionist at the left-leaning Center for Science in the Public Interest, told The Hill on Monday that she's disappointed in how the FDA has interpreted Obamacare's food mandate. Her group, which once famously turned fettucine alfredo into food porn by labeling it 'a heart attack on a plate,' wants to see movie theater concession stands subject to the same rules. 'If someone is going to serve you thousands of calories, the least they could do is tell you how many calories it has,'she told The Hill. Wootan has the support of Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin and Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who want the FDA to force bowling alleys, movie theaters and amusement parks to follow suit. 'Congress intended the scope of the disclosure law to extend to movie theaters, bowling alleys, bookstore cafes, and other like establishments,' the pair has written to the FDA, 'which is the very reason Congress used the phrase 'and similar retail establishments' in the statute to extend the reach of the law beyond restaurants.' While the restaurant lobby may have thrown in the towel, it appears the convenience store and family entertainment lobbies have gone all-in to protect their junk food franchises. Most affected businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach, however. The FDA could issue its final rule at any time, and the devil – or angel, depending on who's telling the story – could be in the details. Pizza chains are hoping for loopholes that will allow them to avoid calculating every possible topping combination. 'Pizza is so customizable that it's literally impossible to put all the calorie information on a menu.' Domino's executive vice president Lynn Liddle told The Hill. The National Restaurant Association also wants the government to provide companies with a modicum of 'flexibility' so they won't have to guarantee that every steak or bowl of soup is nutritionally identical. Fast food restaurants want an exemption for special orders so they only have to disclose calorie counts for sandwiches built according to their standard menus.","Members of Congress who pushed for the rule say it doesn't go far enough and want it expanded to movie theaters, bowling alleys and theme parks .

"Pat Boone, the Fifties' crooner, has been filmed saying he believes that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and not the U.S. Announcing his 'birther' opinions, Boone said the President's long-form birth certificate, which was finally released in April, was a 'photoshopped fraud'. Boone, 77, who is a member of the Beverly Hills Tea Party,  also alleged that the President was 'spending millions of dollars' of taxpayers' money to cover up 'the truth'. Scroll down for video . Taped: Speaking on video, Pat Boone, left, said he did not believe that . President Obama, pictured right speaking in New York last night, was . born in the U.S. Speaking on video to the San Francisco Chronicle, Boone said: 'I was in Kenya about a year and a half ago and everybody said, 'you know he was born here.'…Why else would he be hiding all his records. 'He is spending millions of dollars so we do not have his records. 'And experts have already looked at and been able to verify that this long-form document is a fraud. 'But the media ignores it… a total fraud. A photoshopped fraud.' According to a recent CNN poll, one in six Americans still believes the President was definitely or probably not born in the U.S. However this figure of 17 per cent - after the release of the birth certificate in April - was a fall from the 25 per cent who gave the same response in the previous month. The birth certificate shows that the President was born in Hawaii. Barack Obama waves to the crowds with his wife Michelle at a Democratic fundraiser at Gotham Hall in New York last night .

The book's blurb says it shows . ‘conclusively that no legal authority has ever verified Obama's legal . eligibility to be President’. It has a ‘compelling body of evidence’ to show that Mr Obama ‘is not a natural-born citizen as is required of . all presidents (by) the Constitution’.

"Pampered Japanese dogs are being treated to snacks made from whales on the edge of extinction. Michinoku Farm, based in Tokyo, have been selling a jerky-style treat made out of North Atlantic fin whales imported from Iceland. The firm also sells snacks made from kangaroo hearts and Mongolian horse lungs. Edge of extinction: One of the fin whales that were hunted in Iceland for the pet treats . They marketed the rare meat as 'low calorie' and 'luxuriously lean' and suitable for dogs with allergies to other meats. Commercial whaling was banned in 1986, but Iceland and Norway continue to hunt an annual quota in defiance of the ban. Environmental campaigners are particularly worried about the snack because it is the first time they have noticed whale meat being used for animal consumption, although Japan has been importing fin whale for humans since 2008. Outlawed: Iceland continues to hunt and process fin whale despite a ban on commercial whaling in 1986 . The whale chews came in packets of three sizes, including a 500g bag for 3,780 yen (£25). Nanami . Kurasawa, executive director of the Japanese campaign group IKAN, . worries that this was just a status symbol for rich pet owners. He . said: 'The most likely reason for shops to sell the whale meat dog . treat is to target affluent Japanese who want to show off their wealth . with something different' Tradition: Iceland and Japan are two of the most prominent countries to continue hunting whales . Retreat: After the protest over the whales being used for pet food, the company has recalled the product . The treats were removed from the Michinoku Farm website after protests from four groups, including the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency. Michinoku Farm's president, Takuma Konno, said that he was recalling the product even though it is legal in Japan. 'We just wanted to sell a wide variety of food for dogs,' Mr Konno said. 'Campaigners look at whales as important animals, but we consider dogs to be just as important.' Hvalur, the Icelandic company that exports the whalemeat, caught 148 fin whales in 2010, but had not slaughtered any for the two following years due to a collapse in demand.","Dog snacks were made from North Atlantic fin whales imported from Iceland .

"More than 500 Indian migrant workers have died working on construction projects in Qatar in the last two years with the death toll reaching more than 700, since it was announced the Gulf state will host the 2022 World Cup. Official figures confirmed by the Indian embassy in Doha reveal more than 700 people have lost their lives since the Arab emirate was awarded the tournament in December 2010. Documents show 233 Indian migrants lost their lives in 2010, 239 in 2011, 237 Indians working in Qatar died in 2012 and another 241 perished last year. Official figures from the Indian embassy in Doha have revealed more than 700 Indian migrant workers have died in Qatar since it was announced the Gulf state will be hosting the 2022 World Cup . An estimated 1.2million migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Egypt are working to fuel a construction boom in the Arab emirate . A further 24 Indian nationals died in the country in January alone. In the last two years more than 500 workers have died. In the last four years that number is 974 Indian workers - 717 of those since Fifa announced the World Cup would be held there in 2022. The shocking scale of the death toll among those workers fuelling a construction boom in the Arab emirate has prompted human rights groups to urge Fifa to investigate and call for improved working conditions for the estimated 1.2million migrant workers. Qatar's ministry of labour and social . affairs told the Guardian: 'Clearly any one death in . Qatar or anywhere else is one death too many – for the workers, for . their families, but also for Qataris who welcome guest workers to our . country to perform valuable jobs. 'We are working to understand the . causes of these deaths – as these statistics could include a range of . circumstances including natural causes, and road safety incidents, as . well as a smaller number of workplace incidents.' FIFA President Sepp Blatter announced Qatar as host of the 2022 World Cup in 2010 in Zurich . The paper previously reported 382 Nepalese workers have died in Qatar in the last two years. While the Indian embassy could not provide details as to how people died, Nepalese workers have died as a result of sudden heart failure and workplace accidents. Jim Murphy, the shadow international development secretary, said: 'Preparations for the 2022 World Cup cannot go on like this – the trickle of worrying reports from the construction sites of Qatar has become a torrent.' He said some of the practices taking place in the country are tantamount to forced labour, with fears the death toll could reach into the thousands if no action is taken. Following the revelations about the number of Nepalese deaths the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee said . while construction directly related to the World Cup had yet to start it . was committed to providing proper treatment for workers. An artist impression of the Al Gharafa stadium, one of the Cup venues that organisers said would provide air-conditioned comfort for players and fans during the height of the desert summer . Khalifa International Stadium's capacity will be boosted from 40,000 to 68,030 by 2022 . A statement said: 'Like everyone . viewing the video and images, and reading the accompanying texts, we are . appalled by the findings presented in The Guardian’s report. 'There is no excuse for any worker in Qatar, or anywhere else, to be treated in this manner. 'The . health, safety, well-being and dignity of every worker that contributes . to staging the 2022 FIFA World Cup is of the utmost importance to our . committee and we are committed to ensuring that the event serves as a . catalyst toward creating sustainable improvements to the lives of all . workers in Qatar.' A hearing at the European parliament last week heard representations from human rights groups, Fifa and other parties, after a resolution was passed last year calling for action on the issue. Critics have called for an overhaul of the kafala system, which ties workers to their employers, and closer control of the construction companies involved. The International Trade Union Confederation has warned up to 4,000 workers could die before the tournament kicks off in 2022 if nothing is done. A damning report by Amnesty International late last year revealed workers were being forced to endure 12-hour days. They faced working in searing temperatures with squalid, overcrowded living quarters. They come from India, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Egypt. It has been estimated that the Gulf state will spend £123billion on infrastructure in the next four years.","Fifa announced Qatar as the 2022 hosts in 2010 .

"All Americans would be better off if the top rate of income tax was returned to Eisenhower-era levels of about 90 per cent, economists have claimed. The recommendation would more than double the current top U.S. rate of income tax - 39.6 per cent - and runs counter to more than two decades of economic orthodoxy. At the moment fewer than one per cent of Americans reach the top income tax bracket of $406,750 for individuals and $457,600 for couples, yet the topic is one of the most emotive in U.S. politics. Post-war consensus: President Dwight D Eisenhower presided over a successful U.S. economy in which high taxation was seen as normal practise for those earning incomes far above the national average . Low rates: This graph shows how the U.S. income tax rate has fluctuated in the past century . Fabian Kindermann from the University of Bonn and Dirk Krueger from the University of Pennsylvania make the case for radically higher rates of taxation in a new paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their conclusions come nearly 25 years after the idea that the wealthy should be allowed to keep as much of their money as possible became the accepted political norm. Beginning with the presidency of Ronald Reagan, spurred by the new ideology of neoliberalism, the U.S. saw radical cuts to the top rate of income tax until it fell to less than 30 per cent. The architects of these policies were spurred by ideologues like the radical capitalist Ayn Rand, an originator of the 'wealth creator' myth, who believed rational self-interest would create the most-perfect economic conditions. Taking money out of the hands of the rich was not only unjust, she and her acolytes believed, but also economically illiterate, since those who were best at making money would know the best way to spend it. But as Dr Kindermann and Dr Krueger point out, these tax cuts coincided with a spike in inequality, with the total share of U.S. household income accruing to the top 1 per cent doubling between the early 1970s and 2007. Since the 2008 financial crisis and banking bail-out, inequality has soared more than ever, leading to calls from from academic economists and street-level protesters alike for something to be done to reverse it. Radical right: Ayn Rand, an originator of the 'wealth creator' myth, who believed rational self-interest would create the most-perfect economic conditions . Of course, no-one wants to hand 90 per cent of their income over to the federal government. But much of this fear stems from a misunderstanding of how marginal tax rates work. If you make $500,000 and are subject to a 90 per cent marginal tax rate, that doesn't mean you are going to pay $450,000 in tax. What it means is you pay 90 per cent tax on every dollar you earn over the threshold of $406,750. If you make $500,000 that means you pay the top rate on your final $93,250 of income. The researchers come to their conclusions after some 30 pages of complex economic calculations which they say models 'a quantitative overlapping generations economy'. They claim that 'in the model the top 1 per cent [of earners] look exactly as in the data, at least with respect to their key economic characteristics.' Running their model, Dr Kindermann and Dr Krueger conclude a tax rate of 90 per cent or higher on the top band of earners would not only decrease inequalities in both income and wealth, but also increase everyone's well-being - even those paying the new tax. In essence, Dr Krueger told The Huffington Post, such a high tax would 'provide social insurance against not making it into the 1 per cent.' In the paper he and Dr Kindermann write that 'such high marginal tax rates provide optimal social insurance in a world where very high labour incomes are generated by rare (but somewhat persistent) earnings opportunity.' There is a caveat. It is argued that higher marginal tax rates would not discourage the enterprising and entrepreneurial from wanting to work as hard at making money. This is precisely the contention of Ayn Rand and her acolytes. In her bestselling novel, Atlas Shrugged, Rand imagines a dystopia where successful industrialists abandon their fortunes in response to aggressive regulations. The result of this capital strike is that most vital industries collapse, leaving the nation in ruins, until the wealthy ride to the rescue and reorganise society along the lines of Rand's 'rational selfishness'. But Dr Kindermann and Dr Krueger counter that such an eventually is unlikely, because even those among us who are unusually talented have only a limited window of opportunity to exploit their abilities. They have only a few years to use their skills to make all the money they can. As Dr Krueger told the Huffington Post: 'How much less hard would LeBron James play basketball if he were taxed at a much higher rate?' The answer, the economist says, is not much. With only five or so years of peak earning potential the basketballer will work to earn as much as he possibly can in that time. The question, of course, is: would Jamie Dimon or Lloyd Blankfein behave the same way? And would it matter if they didn't?","Economists' paper calls for return to Eisenhower-era rates of income tax .

"A drug patriarch who gave a thumbs up in his mugshot has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for operating an enormous indoor marijuana farm. James Ford, 59, from Waldo County, Maine, was convicted of numerous offences by a jury last November - including manufacturing more than 100 marijuana plants and possessing a firearm. His family also ran a similar growing operation in Weymouth, Massachusetts, but moved it north when it was discovered and Ford was convicted. Thumbs up: James Ford, 59 was given a 10-year prison sentence for operating an enormous indoor marijuana farm. Police discovered over 300 plants when they raided the warehouse in 2011 (right) According to the Bangor Daily News his wife, Darlene, 58, is facing 40 years in prison but is yet to be sentenced. Their elder of two sons James T. Ford was jailed for five years in June 2013. The 36-year-old was jailed for two years after his growing operation in Massachusetts was uncovered. His younger brother Paul, 33, was given three years and ten months in a federal facility. Members of the Ford family were arrested in November 2011 when the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency raided the family's garage and found hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of marijuana. Family: Ford's wife Darlene, 58, is facing 40 years in prison but is yet to be sentenced while his youngest son Paul, 33, was given three years and ten months in a federal facility . Eldest son: James T. Ford, 36, was jailed for five years in June 2013 for his part in the operation . During the raid, police seized more than 300 marijuana plants, 10 pounds of processed marijuana and two semiautomatic assault weapons. Ford's sentencing was initially delayed because of the passage of the Smarter Sentencing Act. The proposals would reduce sentences for those convicted of non-violent drug offences. It is still passing through Congress. At the time of their arrest in 2011, Jim Pease of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency said: 'It was a very high-tech, very sophisticated, very neat grow. It was very clean, very organized, much like you would think of a computer lab.' Prosecutors said that they grew the drug in Maine for around five years. According to ledgers investigators discovered in a desk - they raked in around $500,000 between 2009 and 2012. The parents lived in an apartment above the garage - which had nothing else inside it aside from workbenches used to make guns and growing equipment.","James Ford of Waldo County, Maine, was convicted of numerous offences .

"The Princeton Review, a prominent test prep company, produced a guide telling college applicants to play up or play down their ethnicity . The Princeton Review, a test preparation and college admission service, produced a guide telling college applicants to play up or play down their ethnicity according to their race. An eight-page section called 'Ethnic Background' advises prospective students who are black, Hispanic, or Asian on the types of topics they should bring up. The coaching was first published by Random House in 1992 in Cracking College Admissions, and most recently updated in 2004, reports Business Week. Black applicants were told to 'make sure the admissions committee knows you're black' by including a photograph. It states: 'Selective colleges have less stringent requirements for black applicants.' The book advises that Asian Americans 'you need to avoid being an Asian Joe Bloggs.' It states this is Asian American applicant 'with a very high math SAT score, a low or mediocre verbal SAT score, very high math-or science-related SATII score, high maths and science grades, few credits in the humanities, few extracurricular activities, an intended major in math or the sciences, and an ambition to be a doctor, an engineer or as a research scientist.' Asian students are told not to attach a photo to their application - but they are advised if they have an 'Asian-sounding surname but aren't Asian, do attach a photograph.' An eight-page section called 'Ethnic Background' advises prospective students who are black, Hispanic, or Asian on the types of topics they should bring up (file photo) The guide states: 'Do not write your application essay about the importance of your family or the positive/negative aspect of living in two cultures. 'These are Asian Joe Bloggs topics, and they are incredibly popular. Instead, write about something entirely unrelated to your ethnic background.' Hispanic students are simply told 'in general, the guidelines for African Americans apply to you.' 'If you have a Hispanic surname (because your father is from Chile, say) but you don’t come from a disadvantaged background, don’t answer the ethnic-background question on your application,' it reads. The book, which is now out of print, is still available in at least 76 libraries nationwide, reports Business Insider. It can also still be bought from third-party sellers on Amazon.com and at Barnes & Noble. New Princeton Review books do not include similar advice.

"The last time Aberdeen faced Dundee United in a Scottish League Cup semi-final, Jimmy Calderwood’s Dons surrendered meekly in a grim 4-1 reverse at Tynecastle. But that dark evening in February 2008 was very much par for the course amid a miserable era that saw Dons fans endure five defeats at that penultimate stage in four years. If Tynecastle was a low, however, the Red Army’s misery in recent years has mainly occurred in Mount Florida. For the thousands heading down from the Granite City, the Road to Hampden was paved with fears that would soon be well-founded. Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes (right) and Dundee United'sJackie McNamara pose with the League Cup . Spirit-crushing defeats followed against First Division Queen of the South in the Scottish Cup in 2008, while Celtic dished out 4-1 and 4-0 thumpings in the last four of both competitions in 2011. Even the serial Scottish Cup misfits of Hibs conquered Aberdeen in the competition’s last four, 2-1, in 2012. Not since Arild Stavrum and Andy Dow’s second-half goals in a Scottish Cup semi-final 2-1 win over Hibs in April 2000 have Aberdeen fans left the national stadium with anything to cheer about. After 15 long years, however, the Red Army finally descends upon Hampden today full of genuine optimism. For under Derek McInnes, Aberdeen’s status as lambs to the slaughter tag has been replaced by gleeful choruses of ‘the sheep are on fire’. Exactly 12 months ago, that was the cry as McInnes ended the Pittodrie club’s pitiful semi-final record, beating St Johnstone 4-0 in the League Cup at Tynecastle en-route to clinching the club‘s first silverware in 19 years in the final against Inverness at Celtic Park. And although Saints gained their revenge at Ibrox in the Scottish Cup last four, McInnes bellieves his side’s efforts last year prove a watershed moment. ‘I thought Celtic Park was a brilliant spectacle for last year’s final,’ said the Dons boss. ‘But you want a Hampden final and it’s great to have the final back being played there. Jackie McNamara insists his Dundee United side must make amends for last term's League Cup anguish . ‘I can’t comment on previous teams but we’ve done well in the cups. We’ve got a big game on Saturday but it’s now second nature to the players and that’s how it should be. ‘Last season, there was an expectation to get that first trophy in almost 20 years. The desperation and need was there. And I think having handled that scenario is good. The players are now a year on, they’ve handled a European campaign and come out with their head held high. ‘It’s great to have that experience. But it doesn’t give you any guarantees you’ll win the game against a very good team like Dundee United. ‘We’re not in a Hampden final yet but the plan is to go all the way.’ Faced with great expectations and a team of perennial cup underachievers, McInnes saw a need to diffuse tensions in his squad ahead of that Saints semi-final 12 months ago. The approach would lay foundations for a challenge to champions Celtic in this season’s Premiership. ‘There was no fancy hotel, no going away - we treated it like it was just another game,’ he recalled. Injured Aberdeen ace Jonny Hayes lifts the Scottish League Cup trophy last year . ‘Playing for Aberdeen, with all the expectation, if you win a few games people can get carried away and when you lose people are falling over themselves with frustration. ‘It’s about keeping the players right and being professional at all times. We can’t affect how supporters view us. But we can affect how we work Monday to Friday. ‘So for that semi we just kept preparations the same as they would be for a league game. We do that for every game now. ‘Whether it’s on the back of a good or bad result, Monday morning is the same at training. If we have to address things from the weekend we do that but then we move on. ‘I think that approach is reflected in our (consistent) results recently. We’ve gone 10 games unbeaten, with eight wins and eight clean sheets in there. ‘And even when we’ve not been at our best, we’ve still got results. There’s a lot to be pleased about. Hayes wheels away in celebration after scoring against Inverness Caledonian Thistle in September . ‘When I came here, I wanted us to compete quickly and get a team on the pitch that was respected in Scotland again. It pleases me no end that we are that team at the minute. But we have to keep trying to build on it as more will be expected as we go along.’ McInnes has a good record against Dundee United - played six, won four, drawn one, lost one. But the solitary defeat, an opening day 3-0 loss to Jackie McNamara’s side at Pittodrie on the opening day of the season, prompts a bout of introspection. ‘There were reasons for it,’ he said. ‘I didn’t help the players that day, if I’m honest. I picked the wrong team after our exploits on the Thursday night in Europe against Real Sociedad. ‘That’s no slight on United, by the way, because hands-down they deserved to win. Our performance was not good enough and we got punished. ‘That defeat to United at the start of the season is perhaps a good message for us ahead of this weekend - that records, experience and good players count for nothing. It’s good performances that help you win games.’","Aberdeen face Dundee United in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals .

"Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, warned many people are being trapped in poverty by high levels of tax . Families are being trapped in poverty by having to pay ‘inordinate’ amounts of tax, Britain's most senior Roman Catholic cleric has warned. The Most Rev Vincent Nichols suggested stay-at-home mothers in particular were left worse off, and insisted the problem had to be tackled with help targeted at the most ‘needy’. He also condemned the ‘disgrace’ of people left so destitute they have to turn to food banks for help. The Archbishop has spoken out again about welfare policy ahead of his trip to Rome where he is to be created as a Cardinal by Pope Francis this weekend. He reiterated his condemnation of people being forced to charities for help but admitted the church had its part to play in the ‘failure’. Today he dismissed the idea that the welfare budget is ‘balooning’ and had ‘actually come down a bit’. But he suggested that the tax system was still penalising people who were struggling to make ends meet. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘And there are people – I’ve had these stories too – with one person in a family working, paying what they consider to be an inordinate burden of tax so that that keeps them in poverty. ‘These are complex matters and I’m not pretending that they’re simple; I’m just saying what I see and hear is people left in destitution and in a country of our wealth that shouldn’t happen.’ Nearly 500,000 people in the UK needed support from food banks last year, according to figures from the Trussell Trust. The Archbishop said: ‘The fact that people are left in destitution is a disgrace. The fact of people left for weeks on end without any support and therefore having to have recourse for food banks in a country as affluent as our is a disgrace. ‘I accept a reform of the welfare system is necessary. It is a complex, difficult thing to achieve. I accept that these things were unintended consequences of reform. ‘My concern is to echo the voices that come to me of the circumstances today - people are hungry, destitute. ‘There must be something wrong with the administration that has that effect on so many people's lives. I believe that is an issue that can be tackled.’ Installed as Archbishop for Westminster in 2009, Vincent Nichols will be created a cardinal in Rome this weekend . Asked if the fact that people were struggling on handouts indicated that the church had a ‘failed’ in its responsibilities to safeguard communities, the Archbishop replied: ‘Certainly.’ But he added: ‘Pope Francis presents these two things to us - the vision of what we should be, and he's not afraid of the reality of what we are.’ He said the church and businesses should also be more sensitive to their ethical responsibilities. ‘It (business) must see itself located as an important player and contributor to society,’ he said. ‘A good business will not survive in a broken society.’ Archbishop Vincent Nichols . The Archbishop also said migrant workers helped ensure large cities such as London were able to ‘carry on working’. He added that it was time for senior politicians to ‘appeal to something more normal and more substantial than fear’ when discussing foreign workers' contributions to the economy. Speaking from the Archbishop's House in Westminster ahead of his departure to Italy, the Archbishop identified London as an example of where the benefits of immigration could be seen. He said: ‘It is perfectly clear in this city if you are up early and on the tubes early in the morning, the people coming in to this city to make sure it carries on working are the immigrant communities. ‘If you go to the National Health Service you know very well that a lot of its work and ongoing survival and service is down to immigrant communities. ‘I think we really should have a positive appreciation of the contribution that people who come to this country make to our well-being and economy. I think the idea that immigrants are a net drain on our economy is false. ‘We should not have a discourse about immigration which is based on fear.’ He added: ‘I think it is - quite frankly - a lack of political leadership if we fashion a debate around fear. I think leaders ought to appeal to something more normal and more substantial than fear.’","Vincent Nichols warns many families are being left poor by the tax system .

"It is classed as easy-to-watch, family-friendly television for a Sunday evening. But this week viewers of BBC1 drama Call the Midwife were subjected to a . graphic grotesque depiction of a back alley abortion before the . watershed which left them shocked. Complaints have been made to broadcasting watchdog OFCOM and directly to . the BBC about the episode which was also yesterday criticised by . professionals and campaigners. Sunday drama: Fans of Call The Midwife were shocked to see the harrowing depiction of a backstreet abortion before the watershed . Many expressed concerns about children being exposed to the graphic . scenes and said that it was not the right way to tackle such a serious . issue. Complaints began being made after the show finished at 9pm and . discussion boards were soon full of comments about the ‘gross’ and . ‘disgusting’ content. One asked: ‘Is it really appropriate to show a backstreet abortion before the watershed?’ Others said they had left the room during the scene or watched from behind their hands. Sunday night’s episode attracted 8.3 million viewers just shy of a series high of 9.3 million on January 20. Fans have come to expect the drama to produce emotional storylines and the occasional bit of uncomfortable viewing. Unhappy viewers: Complaints have been made both to the BBC and watchdog Ofcom about the graphic scenes on Sunday night's episode of Call The Midwife . But many thought that this plot was a step too far. On Mums Net, one user wrote: ‘Had to walk out of the room during illegal . abortion scene’, while another added: ‘Very uncomfortable viewing.’ The scene takes place in the two-bedroom east London flat of pregnant Nora Harding. She lives there in near-squalor with her out-of-work husband and eight . young children because the council refuses to upgrade them to a bigger . property. Mrs Harding is dismayed at the prospect of adding to her already . struggling family and so enlists the help of a neighbour to perform the . abortion, selling her wedding ring to pay for it. The neighbour, a herbalist named Mrs Pritchard, arrives with a rubber . sheet, which she rolls out on the kitchen table, and cloth-bound set of . rusty tools. Mrs Harding climbs onto on the make-shift gurney and lies on her back . with her knees bent, writhing in pain as Mrs Pritchard gets to work. A Digital Spy forum member described the scene as ‘harrowing, from the . rubber sheet going on the table to the way she screamed in pain’. Another wrote: ‘Couldn’t watch the botched illegal abortion scene, had . me squirming.’ Throughout the procedure the camera repeatedly cuts to and from an . unrelated scene in which one of the midwives, Trixie, is getting ready . for a date. True to life: The BBC defended the decision to show the scene saying it reflects the real life of nurses and women in the East End in the 50's (pictured) Using sharp implements she files her nails and pushes back her cuticles, . before painting blood-red varnish on top, which drips into pools on the . floor. But the editing did little to hide the horrors of the unfolding abortion scene. One viewer wrote on a BBC message board: ‘The flicking between the . procedure and the filing/painting of nails actually made me wince more . than if they’d just shown the lady screaming. ‘Very imaginative way of depicting the horror pre water shed.’ Earlier in the episode Mrs Harding had tried other unconventional methods to rid herself of the unwanted baby. Call the Midwife is a BBC period drama based on the memoirs of late author Jennifer Worth. It follows a group of young midwives working in London’s East End slums, . and the work they do out of Nonnatus House, a nursing convent. Now in its second series, the programme first aired in January 2012 and a third series is planned for early 2014. Miranda Hart starred until the departure of her character, Chummy. The . role won her a National Television Award for outstanding drama . performance and she was also nominated for a BAFTA. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Call The Midwife is inspired by the reality of . East End life in the 1950s and prior to the legalisation of abortion, . back street terminations were a documented phenomenon. 'Call The Midwife . has never shied away from the tough conditions and difficult decisions . made by pregnant women throughout this era and the series has become a . critical and popular success thanks to its frank and honest approach.’ They included drinking gin in a scolding hot bath, punching herself in the stomach and taking Epsom salts. And before deciding to go through with the abortion she had sent her . husband out for knitting needles and a crochet hook, with the intention . of performing it herself. Shots of Mrs Harding’s blood-soaked clothes and sickened face are . followed by others of her in a hospital bed, having contracted . septicaemia and collapsed into a coma. The episode ends with her making a full recovery and moving to the country with her family to start a new life. But viewers were left feeling upset and angry over what they had been exposed to. Margaret Morrissey of Parents Outloud said: ‘Broadcasters need to take . responsibility and realise that children will have watched this, . especially since it is half term week for a lot of schools around the . country so they will have been up later. ‘We all know that they [back alley abortions] happened and the problems . that they caused but we don’t need to view it on television. ‘It’s not that I think we should hide things or pretend they didn’t . happen but I just think that sometimes it is something that needs to be . told in the context of a different situation to a television programme. ‘It’s something children will learn about, but during school education in an informed way, not on television in a graphic way.’ Natika Halil, Director of Information FPA (Family Planning Association) said: . ‘Back-street abortion is shocking and upsetting but this was the grim . reality for women in Britain before abortion became legal in 1967. FPA . started running contraception clinics in the 1930s and what happened to . women like ‘Nora’ in Call the Midwife is well documented. 'While it can . be difficult to read or watch, the issue mustn’t be airbrushed. Some . women died and many others suffered terrible health conditions as a . result and this reminds us of a situation we must never go back to.’","BBC1's Call the Midwife showed graphic depiction of back alley abortion .

"A model has given a homeless puppy a second chance in life  after discovering the paralyzed pooch dragging its hind legs across a beach in Thailand. Meagan Penman, 22, from Ottawa,  found the paraplegic dog on a beach in Hua Hin suffering from a broken back and with grisly infected wounds on his legs. But after local animal shelters refused to take the dog, who Meagan named Leo, she made a vow to rescue the poorly pet and take him home with her to Canada to find him a permanent home. Leo has made a miraculous recovery since he was found on a Thai beach, and he has even been fitted with a wheelchair which means he is able to walk again without dragging his hind legs across the ground . The blonde model raised more than $5,000 on crowd funding websites to pay for veterinary care to treat the dog's injuries at a clinic in Thailand. And more than three months after she found him, Meagan finally welcomed Leo onto Canadian soil last month - and she has since found him a foster home with Jamie Smith. Meagan said: 'I was just walking along the beach and saw what looked like half a dog sticking out of a small tide pool - I couldn't understand what I was looking at so I went to have a closer look. 'I realized then he was paralyzed and tried to find a rescue center in the area to take him - but not one would. So I decided then that I would try to take him home with me. Meagan Penman, 22, from Ottawa found Leo with a broken back and infected wounds on his legs. She raised more than $5,000 on crowd funding websites to pay for veterinary care to treat his injuries at a Thai clinic .

'I really didn't know what I was getting myself into at first but next thing I knew I was in the middle of a huge process that took months to finally pull off. 'There were times where I was so stressed and frustrated but I would not let myself take no for an answer. 'So many people told me he would be better off put down, but you cant put a value on a life. 'He was in such distress and I couldn't just ignore this kind of neglect. No animal deserves a life like that. Leo was found on a beach in Hua Hin dragging his hind legs due to injuries that prevented him from walking . Leo suffered a broken back, as well as painful wounds to both of his legs - but Meagan raised money for him to be treated at a clinic in Thailand . 'And Leo was so desperate for any kind of human contact, it was heartbreaking, he is such a sweet dog.' After Leo arrived in Canada last month, Meagan set out to find him a permanent foster home - as she was unable to dedicate enough time to him herself. And Leo now lives with Jamie Smith in Sarnia, Canada - which is around eight hours away from Meagan's home in Ottawa. Meagan made a vow to rescue Leo and take him home with her to Canada to find him a permanent home . Thanks to crowdfunding, Leo was treated for his injuries in Thailand and has found a home in Canada . But the pup is making a miraculous recovery and has even been fitted with a wheelchair which means he is able to walk again, without scraping his hind legs across the floor. Meagan said: 'He still has some health issues that are being dealt with but he is doing really well. 'Jamie has alot of time for him and they are really enjoying each others company, they go for many walks and he gets to go to the park and chase squirrels. 'I am so happy that he ended up with her, they are great for each other. And I am hoping to make the journey to visit them in the next couple of months.' Leo now lives in a foster home in Sarnia, which is around eight hours away from Meagan's home in Ottawa .","Meagan Penman, 22, found the paraplegic dog on a beach in Hua Hin .

"Once-pristine lakes in Ontario, Canada, are now coated by a jello-like layer of slime caused by decades of industrial activity, a new study reveals. The scum coating now present on vast bodies of water in the province is due to the rapid growth of a new type of plankton which secretes the unpleasant goo, according to a team of researchers. Years of industrial activity has eaten away at nutrients around the lakes, killing off species that used to live there and allowing the Holopedium gibberum plankton to thrive. 'Jellification': A researcher holds up a scoop of the jello-like scum produced by a type of plankton which has multiplied rapidly thanks to industrial processes . After-effects: A decline in calcium, caused by effects like acid rain, killed off competitors and allowed the scum-producing Holopedium gibberum to expand . Researchers - who pictured themselves scooping gelatinous handfuls of the scum out of the lakes - said they found calcium levels in the earth by the lakes had plummeted in recent decades. Chemical waste from factories - spread by weather phenomena like acid rain - can eat away at minerals usually present in soil, causing profound changes to the animals and plants that live nearby. According to the researchers - a mixture of government scientists and academics from the universities of Cambridge and Ottawa - populations of the plankton which produce the substance has doubled since the 1980s. It has corresponded with a decline in the calcium levels in surrounding soil, which began with the rise of industry in the 1850s, but picked up significantly in the late 20th Century. Their findings were published this month in a journal by the Royal Society, which said the effect could take thousands of years to reverse. Once-pristine: The jello-like layer is covering lakes in Canada. Pictured is a body of water in Muskoka . The lakes used to be full of a different species of plankton - called Daphnia - which had lived there for centuries and thrived on the calcium which made its way into the water from surrounding soil. The tiny animal needed the calcium to build a thick exo-skeleton that stopped it from getting eaten by midges - but when the deposits started to run out they struggled to survive. While populations declined, the Holopedium gibberum - which doesn't need as much calcium - began to thrive instead. Their defensive mechanism is to surround themselves with a jello-like scum, which is now spreading over the lake. Invader: The Holopedium gibberum is producing the 'jelly' substance as a defense against predators . As well as contributing to the 'jellification' effect, falling calcium levels could have a knock-on effect on public health, as these nutrients can make their way up the food chain into humans. The water could also become less safe to use. Dr Andrew Tanentzap, a Cambridge University plant scientist, said: 'As calcium declines, the increasing concentrations of jelly in the middle of these lakes will reduce energy and nutrient transport right across the food chain, and will likely impede the withdrawal of lake water for residential, municipal and industrial uses.' 'In Ontario, 20% of government-monitored drinking water systems now come from landscapes containing lakes with depleted calcium concentrations that favour, and this is only set to increase.' Environment laws have stopped many of the processes which led to the removal of calcium, but the slow-moving effects are still being felt, and could prove difficult to shift. Tanentzap said: 'Pollution control may have stopped acid deposits in the landscape, but it’s only now that we are discovering the damage wasn’t entirely reversed'. 'It may take thousands of years to return to historic lake water calcium concentrations solely from natural weathering of surrounding watersheds'.","Jelly layer in Canadian lakes expanded in recent years, study found .

"A Russian motorist was left stunned after he found a cat stuck in the most unusual place - his jeep's suspension spring. Vitaliy Bouranin, 32, said that he hadn't noticed anything when he'd climbed into his Toyota Land Cruiser to set off on a business trip in Sakhalin, Russia.

Tightly wound: This little cat looks unmoved by all of the attention he is receiving to free him from the suspension spring in Russia . Helping hand: One man shoves his hand right into the spring in an attempt to push the cat out . He said: 'As I was filling up, I heard a noise that sounded like a cat meowing. I thought it might be under the car so when I put the fuel nozzle back I looked under the car and couldn't see it, but I could still hear it. 'After a little poking around I finally saw a patch of fur and realised the cat somehow ended up inside the spring. 'I have no idea how long it was there, or far more importantly, no idea how it got there. I would have said it was impossible for a cat to get in the middle of a spring like that but somehow it had managed it.' You're free: The cat appears to have a stretch as he is released from the spring after being stuck in a cramped position for a very long time . Nine lives: This cat had a lucky escape after being driven 50 miles unnoticed . He quickly asked an attendant for help, but he couldn't get the cat out. Staff then called the police and fire service who eventually decided the only thing to do was dismantle the car and remove the suspension spring. Surprisingly, the cat stayed calm throughout the three-hour ordeal to free him. He was then put into a box so he could be taken back to the large Russian island in the North Pacific Ocean in southeast Russia where his epic journey had begun.

"Plaster casts have changed relatively little in the 300 years they have existed, but the treatment has just been given a 21st century makeover. A new 3D-printed cast has recently won an award for its innovative design because, quite apart from its slick look, it uses ultrasound to speed up healing too. The Osteoid Medical Cast is the product of four months of research by a Turkish design student. Droid medicine: The award-winning Osteoid medical cast pulses low frequency ultrasound directly on the arm . ‘Conventional medical casts sacrifice ventilation for structural integrity,’ Deniz Karasahin says in his paper proposing the design. ‘As a result they are itchy, they smell very bad and due to plaster’s material properties they are bulky, heavy and they limit patient’s exposure to water.’ Turkish student Deniz Karasahin (pictured) won the 2014 Golden A'Design Award for his concept . The Osteoid medical cast, he claims, tackles the problem by 3D-printing the cast to fit the shape of the patient’s arm, and also providing ventilation holes. To perfectly fit the cast to a patient’s arm, the injured area is scanned with a 3D body scanner. This data is then transferred to modelling software, which determines the overall size and geometry of the finished cast. Once printed, a locking mechanism and algorithmically generated ventilation holes area added. According to Karasahin, from . Izmir, Turkey, a low intensity pulsed . ultrasound (Lipus) bone stimulator is then placed directly on a patient's skin when the design has been printed. The medical cast is combined with the Lipus stimulator system to speed up the healing process.The . company says that spending just 20 minutes a day hooked to the system, . which plugs directly into the cast, reduces healing time by up to 38 per . cent and increases the healing rate up to 80 per cent over traditional . casts. Later on additional locking mechanisms and algorithmically generated ventilation holes are added to the final data along with Lipus probe adapters . Its maker claims that spending just 20 minutes a day hooked up to the mains could increase the healing rate for fractures and breaks by up to 80 per cent . The ventilation holes also enable the Lipus bone stimulator probes to be placed directly over the injured area. There is a thin layer of rubber fixed to . the edges of the Lipus adapters, which helps these pieces . to fit on the ventilation holes of the medical cast. ‘The most difficult part was to come up with a fully functioning locking mechanism which is strong enough to protect the limb,’ Karasahin concludes. It also had to be ‘practical enough to put it on the fragile injured area and simple enough so that it doesn’t disturb the general form of the medical cast.’ The product is still in its design phase so the date it will be on the market is not known but, when it does, it could revolutionise cast technology. As reported by MailOnline last year, Jake Evill, a media design graduate from New Zealand, has worked with the orthopaedic department of the Victoria University of Wellington to create a similar next generation cast. Named the Cortex, it uses 3D scans and X-rays to provide tailor-made support for an injury and once printed it easily clips on to the affected area. It is lightweight, ventilated, washable and thin enough to fit under a sleeve.

"Scientists have discovered the gene that protects young and middle-aged adults from strokes. People with a specific variant of a gene, known as PHACTR1, have a lower risk of suffering a cervical artery dissection - one of the most common causes of strokes in those under the age of 50. A cervical artery dissection is a tear in the artery in the nec, that leads to the brain. The tear can lead to blood clots developing, which can restrict the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke. People with a variant of the gene known as PHACTR1 are at reduced risk of suffering a cervical artery dissection, a tear in an artery in the neck that leads to the brain. Cervical artery dissection is one of the most common causes of stroke in people under 50 . The same gene variant has also been identified as a protector against migraines and affects the risk of heart attack. Scientists hope the breakthrough will herald new treatments and strategies to stop strokes in young people. Approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke each year. In the UK 152,000 people a year suffer a stroke. It is the third largest cause of death after heart disease and cancer. Brain injuries caused by strokes are a major cause of adult disability in the UK, with a quarter of these people aged under 65. Cervical artery dissection is a tear in the lining in one of the arteries in the neck. This can make a person more likely to develop blood clots, which can restrict the blood supply to the brain and lead to a stroke. Blood clots can then become stuck in the tear in the artery wall, or they can break off and travel to the brain. When the blood flow to the brain is disrupted, it can become starved of oxygen and nutrients. This damages brain cells and they begin to die. The brain controls everything the body does, including  movement, speech, vision and emotions. Cervical artery dissection is one of the most common causes of stroke in people under the age of 50. Source: Bupa . Professor of Clinical Neurology Pankaj Sharma, of Royal Holloway, University of London, said: 'This is an important breakthrough.' The findings provide scientists with a greater understanding of how this gene appears to influence key functions, he added. He continued: 'This could have major implications for the treatment of these severe and disabling conditions.' The study was the largest of its kind and involved researchers from around the world screening the entire genome of 1,400 patients with cervical artery dissection. Another  14,400 people without the disease were also studied. Cervical artery dissection can lead to the adjacent nerves in the neck being compressed. This can  lead to blood clotting, which potentially causes blockages, which lead to strokes or even brain damage if the clots travel to the brain. Professor Sharma added: 'Further genetic analyses and worldwide collaborations of this kind provide hope of pinpointing the underlying mechanisms that cause stroke. 'The Bio-Repository of DNA in Stroke (BRAINS) study I am leading is creating a large stroke DNA biobank which will give an exciting opportunity to identify the genes directly linked to the condition.' The study published in the journal Nature Genetics. Cervical artery dissection is a tear in the lining in one of the arteries in the neck (pictured in red).

"A gorilla born just five days ago at a zoo in Minnesota has died after 'complications' feeding him. The male baby - who had not been named - seemed healthy and strong when he was born last Wednesday at Como Zoo in St Paul. But the tiny primate fell ill and was dead less than a week later - after he apparently didn't feed properly from his mother. Zookeepers said that despite seeming to have a strong maternal instinct straight away, new mother Alice would cradle him out of sight - raising the prospect that she wasn't feeding him. Scroll down for video . Not long for this world: The tiny baby, pictured above the day he was born, died Monday. He was five days old . Motherly love: The baby, pictured above with his mother, Alice, could have died due to 'complication' feeding, zookeepers said . In a statement posted Monday, zoo officials said Alice showed all the signs of a strong maternal bond with her son, but that they kept their distances to minimize stress on the new mother. They said: 'It is with a very heavy heart that we announce the passing of the baby gorilla that was born at Como Zoo to first-time mother Alice on Wednesday, November 19. 'The baby had appeared as if he was doing well through Saturday evening. He had a strong grip and was vocal. Alice was showing positive signs of maternal instinct, had been observed nursing and cradling the baby. 'Despite best efforts to monitor and record the baby’s food intake, many times Alice would cradle her baby to her chest with her back towards the observing zookeepers making it difficult to determine when and if nursing was indeed taking place. Cradled: Alice had a strong maternal bond, officials said. But they could not be sure whether he was properly fed because Alice would cradle him while turning away from watching zookeepers . 'To prevent undue stress on new mothers, and allow them the necessary time to bond with their baby, it is imperative that zoo staff and veterinarians not intervene unless absolutely necessary. 'On Sunday morning it was apparent that the baby was weak and his health failing. While the intervention process was happening the baby was set down by Alice and the zookeepers were able to retrieve him without the need to immobilize Alice. 'Resuscitation efforts on the infant were quickly preformed but were unsuccessful.' Hearts soared when the baby was born Wednesday, as video footage showed the 4lbs baby in his mother's arms. The newborn was the first of his kind to be born at the zoo in its 55-year history of gorilla care and conservation. Troubles: Vets tried to resuscitate the baby after they realized he was likely to do - but their efforts were unsuccessful . A gorilla mother is very protective of her babies and will carry them on her chest for the first three months - making it difficult to interfere. The babies then ride on their mother's back at around six months old and begin playing on the ground close by. More than a quarter of male gorilla babies survive for less than a year after being born in captivity, figures show. The mortality rate in the wild is even worse. Some 26 per cent of males born since 1980, and 20 per cent of females, did not make it to their first birthday, according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums . Figures from the wild peg death rates at around 42 per cent.","Tiny primate was born Wednesday at Como Zoo in St Paul, Minnesota .

"Samuel Henley, 33, who lives in Liverpool, was convicted of six counts of making indecent photos of children . A former teacher at Gordonstoun, the boarding school attended by Prince Charles, who was sacked after downloading child abuse images has been banned from the profession. Samuel Henley, 33, who lives in Liverpool, was convicted of six counts of making indecent photos of children and given a two year-conditional discharge in February. The maths teacher at the £32,000-a-year Gordonstoun, in Moray, Scotland, was also placed on the sex offenders' register. At a Fitness to Teach hearing held by the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) a panel decided Henley, the son of a barrister, was unfit to teach. Henley, who now helps to run three branches of the artisan Baltic Bakehouse in Liverpool, did not attend the hearing and was removed from the teaching register. In February, Chester Crown Court heard officials at the school sacked Henley after detectives swooped on a property near Sefton Park in Liverpool, in 2010. British officers were acting on a tip from police in the Netherlands who were investigating child abuse images being shared among paedophiles on the file sharing website GigaTribe. In a statement after the fitness to teach hearing, the GTCS panel said: 'The conviction in this case is of the gravest kind. 'There has been no evidence provided about the whether the behaviour could be remedied. 'In the context of being a teacher, this conduct is not capable of being remedied. 'The behaviour is incompatible with being a registered teacher and a finding of unfitness is necessary in order to protect the public interest.' If Henley wanted to return to the classroom he would have to re-apply to the GTCS and face another hearing. The panel ruled Henley would not be able to re-apply for two years. During his time at Gordonstoun, Prince Charles has complained that he was bullied, punched as he slept and saw friends tortured with pliers and the Queen Mother pleaded for him to be moved.

The school, whose motto is 'there is more in you', was also attended by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. There are around 600 pupils aged 13-18 who each live in nine boarding houses. It was founded in 1934 by German educator Kurt Hahn and is named after the 17th century 150-acre estate owned by Sir Robert Gordon, a historian and Scottish courtier. There is no indication that any of the children depicted in Henley's stash of child pornography had any links to the school. Henley was contacted at one of his bakeries but refused to comment on the teaching ban. Gordonstoun was founded in 1934 by Dr Kurt Hahn . Dr Hahn had fled Germany in 1933 and initially started a school with three pupils . The next year pupil numbers increased and he signed a lease with the Gordon-Cumming family for the Gordonstoun estate . Today the school sits in 200 acres and has primary and secondary facilities . It is one of the last remaining full boarding schools, and houses 600 male and female pupils . Prince Charles was a pupil at the school in the 1960s . Other royal alumni include Prince Edward, who was head boy in 1982, and Zara Phillips . Prince Andrew went to the school in the 1970s and became known for his hockey skills .

"With five children already and another on the way, Marie, a 30-year-old full time mother from the Democratic Republic of Congo's Kasai Oriental province, was looking forward to meeting her new baby. Like other Congolese mothers, she had booked into the local hospital for the birth and had saved up to pay for the services of a midwife. But things didn't go to plan and as a result, Marie has spent months imprisoned in hospital, her newborn baby with her - all because she didn't have the £35 needed to pay for the emergency caesarian she was forced to have. Prisoner: Marie was told she couldn't leave hospital after giving birth until she paid for her caesarean . Speaking to MailOnline, she explained: 'I came into the hospital on 2nd November to give birth to my sixth child, but there were complications. 'My child is out of danger now - he has no health problems. But I am still in the hospital because I don't have the money to pay for the operation I had to have because of the birth complications. 'I have to pay to leave the maternity ward and I don't have the money. I had saved up the money to pay for a normal birth but the complications meant that the birth cost more – now I owe 53,000 Congolese francs (£35) and I don't have the money to pay that. 'When it came time to go home, the nurses asked me for the money and I had to tell them that I didn't have it. That's why I'm still here – the nurses didn't want to let me leave.' Shockingly, Marie's story is far from unique as one of her doctors, Josephine, confessed. Fees: In the Democratic Republic of Congo Health health services rely on charging patients fees (file photo) 'There are five women in this hospital at this point who are in the same situation, although one of these lost her child during the birth,' she explains, adding: 'I don't think it costs the hospital any more to keep them here.' Asked about Marie, Josephine insisted that she and fellow doctors are right to hold her prisoner in hospital and said that if they had let Marie have the caesarian for nothing, they would be forced to do the same for other patients. 'This woman's wound has already healed so she has no need to stay in hospital any longer,' she explained. 'She is only here because she doesn't have the money needed to allow her to leave. 'We have guards on the door to ensure patients who aren't supposed to leave don't do so without permission. 'There's only one door out and there are two sentries guarding it. They are very vigilant: the security is very tight, people can't escape. No escape: Doctor Josephine said there were five other mothers imprisoned in the hospital (file photo) 'It is a somewhat difficult situation, because if we take responsibility for this woman then all the others will want us to do the same for them, and if we don't it will be showing a kind of favouritism – as if we preferred to help one woman rather than others.' The DRC is one of the toughest places for children to be born according to women and children's charity, Save The Children. According to their figures, the child mortality rate in the African country is as high as 146 per 1,000 live births while the newborn mortality rate is 44 per 1,000. By contrast, just five in every 1,000 British children dies before the age of five. And while British mothers can give birth for nothing, the DRC has no public healthcare system and as a result, less than 25 per cent of the population has access to a functional health service that they can afford to use. Commenting on Marie's story Justin Forsyth, Save the Children CEO said . every mother should have the right to free care in labour and has . called on David Cameron and other world leaders to take action. Problems: Marie's experience is compounded by years of fighting which has wrecked infrastructure . Dangerous: Fighting has forced many to flee while making life precarious for those who remained behind . He said: 'No . mother should be kept hostage because she is unable to pay for the . emergency care that saved her life and that of her newborn child. 'It's . a scandal and every mother – no matter where she lives in the world - . should have access to a midwife and free care when she needs it the . most. 'Marie's . story shows just why it is important for countries to step up and put . the health of their mothers and newborn babies first.' As for Marie herself, being released from hospital remains a distant dream. Alone after her husband returned home to care for their other children and raise the money needed to free her, Marie says she has no idea when she will finally be released. 'I don't have family who can help me and there is no other way for me to leave the hospital other than paying what I owe,' she admits. 'It's just the operation I need to pay for - they aren't trying to charge me for the extra days I've had to stay. 'I am allowed to have visitors but I'm not allowed out of the hospital. I don't know how long I'll be here: I just have to wait until my husband finds the money.'

"Despite ISIS wanting to introduce its own currency the terrorist group is offering to pay a cash reward for anyone who captures a Western spy - in American dollars. In a leaflet circulated via ISIS's social media accounts, the group offered to pay $5,000 to anyone who captures 'an agent of the crusaders' or provides information that leads to them finding a spy working for the West. The leaflet, published yesterday, is being disseminated in Syria's Aleppo province. Despite ISIS wanting to introduce its own currency the terrorist group is offering to pay a cash reward for anyone who captures a Western spy - in American dollars; the leaflet above offering the payment has been circulated via the terrorist group's media accounts . The leaflet reads that it is 'imperative for every Muslim' to help ISIS catch Western spies . According to Vocative.com the leaflet reads: 'The crusaders and the Arab dictators are using agents and spies to plant electronic chips in places of the Mujahideen, in order to bomb them with the crusaders' coalition airstrikes. 'Persecuting and bringing agents in is imperative for every Muslim.' The website reports that the latest ploy by ISIS could be motivated by the success of several recent U.S. led airstrikes, including one that almost killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the town of al-Qaim, on the border between Iraq and Syria. Earlier this month Mail Online revealed that ISIS wanted to introduce its own Islamic currency as part of its attempts to solidify its makeshift caliphate. Militants were said to want to bring back the original dinar, which is an ancient currency from early Islam, and religious figures in Mosul and Iraq’s Nineveh province have apparently announced its return in mosques. The currency known as the dinar, which once consisted purely of gold and silver coins, is today used by a variety of countries, but the coins are created from different materials to the originals. However, the jihadi group is understood to be planning to return to the original gold and silver coins, which were first introduced during the Caliphate of Uthman in 634 CE. The original Islamic dinar was a gold coin which was the weight of gold equivalent to 4.3 grams. Its silver counterpart, known as the Islamic dirham, was a silver coin equal in weight to 3 grams of silver. The latest ploy by ISIS could be motivated by the success of several recent U.S. led airstrikes, including one that almost killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, seen above,  in the town of al-Qaim . Militants were said to want to bring back the original dinar, which is an ancient currency from early Islam, and religious figures in Mosul and Iraq’s Nineveh province have apparently announced its return in mosques . Both were round in shape and one side of the coin was typically stamped with an Islamic message, while the other featured the date of minting and the country’s ruler. While ISIS has yet to confirm the introduction of its currency, social media is awash with claims that leading religious figures announced the plans during recent prayers in Mosul and Nineveh province. It is believed ISIS wants to use the independent currency in areas it controls as part of its war on the West. The currency, which could be introduced within the next few weeks, will involve changing from regular dinars and Lira to golden dinars and silver dirhams. Last month, it emerged that ISIS is making about $1million a day from black market oil sales alone. The group extracts oil from territory captured across Syria and Iraq, and sells it to smugglers. David Cohen, who leads the Treasury Department's effort to undermine the Islamic State's finances, said the extremists also get several million dollars a month from wealthy donors, extortion rackets and other criminal activities, such as robbing banks. In addition, he said the group has taken in at least $20million in ransom payments this year from kidnappings.","ISIS said it was 'imperative for every Muslim' to help them catch spies .

"Dutch teenager Laura Dekker finished her solo sailing journey around the world in good spirits, despite endless debate about the terms under which she is allowed to be at sea. She completed her 518-day trek today after docking her yacht Guppy in St. Maarten, ending a yearlong expedition that supposedly made her the youngest person ever to sail alone around the globe, though her trip was interrupted at several points. Ms Dekker, 16, faced several court cases from the time she announced her intentions to travel the world at the age of 14. She said government organisations tried to deter her from her journey, and because of that, she may not return home to the Netherlands. Scroll down for video . Around the world in 518 days: Laura Dekker arrived in St.Maarten Yacht Club today after sailing around the world solo, the youngest ever to do so, she claims . Land ho! The strong-willed 16 year old looks happy to touch down on dry land . Nothing but blue skies: The port of Simpson Bay, Saint Maartin was a scenic way to end the journey . Dutch authorities tried to block Ms Dekker's trip, arguing she was too young to risk her life, while school officials complained she should be in a classroom. She once said she wanted to move to Australia after her voyage was over, the Associated Press reports, though it’s unclear what she’ll do now that she’s finished. She may sail to New Zealand or Bonaire, Dutch News says. Or perhaps finish her schooling. The strong-willed teenager made it clear that she didn’t feel like returning to her home country of the Netherlands. ‘Over a period of 11 months, I was constantly afraid that Youth Care would lock me up,’ she wrote on her blog. ‘It was all a frightening and traumatic experience. So often these terrible memories come to me. I can’t ignore them. It is painful.’ Unhappy: She wrote on her blog that she is deeply unhappy with how the Dutch government handled her desire to travel the world and said she may never return . At home at sea: A 15-year-old Laura Dekker poses for a photo upon arrival in Kralendijk, on February 9, 2011 on the Caribbean island of Boanaire . Sail away: Laura Dekker, then 14, sails away from the port of Den Osse for world solo sailing bid, on August 4, 2010 on her yacht Guppy (centre) She continued: ‘Now, after sailing . around the world, with different port approaches, storms, dangerous . reefs, and the full responsibility of keeping myself and Guppy safe, I . feel that the nightmares the Dutch government organisations put me . through, were totally unfair.’ 'After sailing around the world with the full . responsibility of keeping myself and Guppy safe, I feel that the . nightmares the Dutch government organisations put me through, were . totally unfair.' -Laura Dekker . In all, she sailed 27,000 nautical . miles, on a trip with stops that sound like a skim through a travel . magazine: the Canary Islands, Panama, the Galapagos Islands, Tonga, . Fiji, Bora Bora, Australia, South Africa and now, St. Maarten. Dozens of people jumped and cheered as Ms Dekker waved, wept and then walked across the dock accompanied by her mother, father, sister and grandparents, who had greeted her at sea earlier. She arrived at the port after struggling against high seas and heavy winds on a final leg from Cape Town, South Africa. There and back again: A map on Laura Dekker's website shows the dizzying journey she completed by herself . The spitfire teenager claims she is the youngest sailor to complete a round-the-world voyage. However, Guinness World Records and the World Sailing Speed Record Council did not verify the claim, saying they no longer recognize records for youngest sailors to discourage dangerous attempts. Ms Dekker said she was born aboard a yacht off the coast of New Zealand and said she first sailed solo at six years old. At ten, she said, she began dreaming about crossing the globe. Her mother Babs Muller told the Dutch News that her daughter ‘sails like a devil.’ Legal troubles: In 2009, a 13-year-old Laura Dekker and her father left, fought a civil court case by the youth protection services seeking to her stop the solo sailing plans . Allowed to travel: After going to court to fight for her right to travel, Laura, 14, showed her boat off to the press . Ms Dekker’s lawyer agreed. ‘Her wish to do this was something that came from her heart and soul and no one was going to stop her,’ Peter de Lange said. He advised the teenager throughout her journey. In 2009, Ms Dekker, then 14, ran away to St. Maarten to buy a boat after leaving her father a note telling him ‘Don’t worry about me. You’re always in my heart. I will find freedom soon.’ Authorities in St. Maarten found her and took her away just as she was buying a boat. She . celebrated her 16th birthday during the trip, eating doughnuts for . breakfast after spending time at port with her father and friends the . night before. Her father told Dutch News that her daughter is independent and stoic, and isn’t interested in the media attention. ‘She would prefer to be completely left alone when she comes to St Maarten, no journalists, no fuss,’ he said.‘She doesn’t care that American television stations are clamouring for interviews. She’s become a global brand but she’s just not interested.’ Unlike other young sailors who recently crossed the globe, Ms Dekker repeatedly anchored at ports along the way to sleep, study and repair her 38-foot sailboat. During her trip, she went surfing, scuba diving, cliff diving and discovered a new hobby: playing the flute, which she said in her weblog was easier to play than a guitar in bad weather. Ms Dekker also complained about custom clearings, boat inspections, ripped sails, heavy squalls, a wet and salty bed, a near-collision with two cargo ships and the presence of some persistent stowaways: cockroaches. Ms Dekker launched her trip two months after Abby Sunderland, a 16-year-old U.S. sailor, was rescued in the middle of the Indian Ocean during a similar attempt. Jessica Watson of Australia completed a 210-day solo voyage at age 16, a few months older than Ms Dekker.","Laura Dekker, now 16, began her global journey a year and a half ago amidst legal battles .

"Prosecutors have asked for strict security for a Massachusetts teenager charged with killing his teacher after he allegedly attacked a female youth worker this month. In court papers released Thursday at the request of The Salem News, Essex County prosecutors said 15-year-old Philip Chism slipped away from caregivers before the June 2 incident at a the Metropolitan Detention Center in Boston. Prosecutor Kate MacDougall said Chism crept along a common hallway 'crouched down out of view,' followed the woman to a locker room and tried to choke her while holding a pencil. Other workers came to the woman's aid when she screamed. Danger to others: Prosecutors have requested tighter security for Philip Chism, 15 (pictured in January), after he allegedly escaped carers and tried to choke a youth worker . Alleged assault: Chism attacked a youth worker at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Boston, say prosecutors . Chism is at Worcester State Hospital for evaluation, and prosecutors have expressed concerns about security at the facility, reports the Salem News. Chism pleaded not guilty to robbing, raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer after following her into a restroom last October. A 15-year-old accused of brutally raping and murdering his teacher last year has attacked a female guard at his youth facility, it has been reported. Missed: Math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, was raped and killed with a box cutter last October . 'The . Department of Youth Services is working closely with law enforcement to . investigate an assault that took place on a member of the staff at our . Dorchester facility,' Alec Loftus, Department of Youth Services, told WCVB, which first reported the assault. Authorities . still don't know what motivated the transfer student . from Clarksville, Tenneessee to kill his teacher. He has pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder in the death of Ritzer, whose body was found in the woods near Danvers High School in October. Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene. Chism, . who had been asked to stay late by Ritzer to help after school, . allegedly followed her into a bathroom on October 22 and attacked her, . sexually assaulted her twice, stripped her and then stole her cellphone, . credit cars and her driver's licenses. According . to investigators, her body was then placed in a recycling bin and . carted away to a wooded area behind the school and dumped. Dumping the violent assault on Ritzer, Chism, who was then just 14, allegedly raped her twice - once with a stick. After . dumping her body, prosecutors say Chism returned to school barefoot . where he changed into his soccer clothes and threw away his bloodied . school clothes. He then went to eat a burger at Wendy's and caught a screening of Woody Allen film 'Blue Jasmine'. Police . arrested him later that evening when he was found walking down a busy . highway. He had a bloody box-cutter in his pocket along with Ritzer's . underwear. Last month, Ritzer's parents Tom and Peggie Ritzer issued a video statement speaking about their loss while also thanking the community for their support. 'These . past six months have been a period of great pain and sorrow for our . family and all those who knew and loved Colleen,' mother Peggie said. 'Each . day presents new challenges but we are blessed by the support of family . and friends. Through the many acts of genuine kindness to honor our . daughter and sister, our spirits are lifted. Though difficult, we strive . to follow Colleen's words to find good in every day.' Mental health: Chism's mental state is being evaluated at the Worcester State Hospital . Crime scene: Colleen Ritzer's body was found in a wooded area near Danvers High School following the brutal killing . Heartbroken: In a video shared last month, . Ritzer's family spoke about their loss while thanking the community for . support. Pictured is Ritzer's sister Laura, father Tom, mother Peggie and brother Tom . In the video, Mr Ritzer thanked everyone for turning out to raise money in Colleen's name. 'Thank . you for your kind words, generous gestures and support of the . scholarship fund in Colleen’s name that will empower future generations . of thoughtful, caring teachers to emulate Colleen’s passion to inspire . students to discover their full potential,' Mr Rtizer said, flanked by . Mrs Ritzer and Colleen's sister Laura and brother Tom. Following . his arrest, classmates and teachers at the school expressed shock that . such a quiet and polite boy could commit such a horrendous crime. Chism's . mother Diana - who is separated from father Stacey - said her son was . 'born in love' and that she is 'struggling to understand' the murder.","Philip Chism allegedly raped and murdered Danvers High School math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, in a school bathroom last October .

"More than a quarter of rough sleepers in London are migrants from Eastern European countries that joined the EU in the past decade, figures reveal. Counts found that new arrivals from Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic account for 28 per cent of rough sleepers in the capital. Meanwhile, official England-wide statistics showed that the number of rough sleepers had risen by 37 per cent since 2010, as Britain has been gripped by a growing shortage of affordable housing. Romanians sleeping rough in Park Lane, London: Figures show that nearly 30 per cent of all London's rough sleepers are from Eastern European countries which have recently joined the European Union . Romanian travellers sitting on a doorway in Park Lane: The are has become a frontline in the battle between immigration officials and Eastern European migrants who sleep on the streets and beg for a living . The figures come amid concern that increasing numbers of rough sleepers from Romania and Bulgaria will put a strain on services offered by Britain's welfare state. Citizens from the two countries gained the right to take up residence in the UK on January 1, but have so far not arrived in the numbers some had feared. Notoriously, however, several camps have sprung up in high profile locations, such as the wealthy area around Marble Arch, in central London, which has become a frontline in the running battle between immigration officials and Eastern European migrants who sleep on the streets and beg or steal for a living. Citizens of the EU who do not have a job and cannot support themselves are not allowed to live in Britain - meaning that officials can deport those who are unemployed and sleeping rough. The problem of Polish rough sleepers in the London has become so bad that last year a homeless charity in the capital produced a Polish-language video warning of the dangers of moving to the city without a job or means to support themselves. It advises Poles to ‘be well prepared’ if they are coming to Britain – with a guaranteed job and back-up money. But it also shows dramatic and alarming images of a Polish immigrant, played by an actor, who loses his job and is then beaten up and burned while he is sleeping on the street. Streets not paved with gold: A file picture shows Thomas, a Pole who was living in woods near Lincoln. The numbers of Polish homeless prompted the production of a video for Polish speakers warning of the dangers . Rough sleepers include people who are 'about to bed down ... or actually bedded down in the open air', said a report accompanying the data released today. The steepest regional rises were seen in the East Midlands and the South East, areas housing campaigners say are particularly affected by high housing costs and austerity-inspired cuts to local services. In London the total number of rough sleepers dipped slightly on last year's figure, but it nevertheless accounted for than a fifth of the national total. 'Case work statistics by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (Chain) found migrants sleeping rough in the capital were most likely to be Poles, accounting for one in every ten people sleeping outdoors. That was followed by Romania, with 8 per cent, and Lithuania, with 3 per cent. In sum more than half the capital's rough sleepers were from overseas, figures showed. Around 15 per cent hailed from countries outside Europe. Rough sleeping counts and estimates split by London and the rest of England: In London the total number of rough sleepers has dipped slightly since last year, but it still accounted for than a fifth of the national total . While the number of rough sleepers in . London dipped 3 per cent since the same period last year, elsewhere in . the country saw big rises in the numbers living out on the streets. In the East Midlands, 206 people were . reported sleeping rough – a 50 per cent rise on last year, including . increases of 96 per cent in Derby and 80 per cent in Northampton. In . the South East outside London, 532 people were reported sleeping rough – . a 20 per cent rise on last year, including increases of 275 per cent in . Slough and a 58 per cent in Oxford. Other . cities and regions showing significant rises were Bristol, where 41 . people were sleeping rough, up 356 per cent; Stoke-On-Trent, with 16 . people, up 700 per cent; Coventry, with 26, up 117 per cent; and . Cornwall, with 77 people, up 54 per cent. Homelessness charity Crisis said that . many of those regions had seen deep cuts to local homelessness services. It said the numbers of rough sleepers was likely to rise thanks to a . chronic shortage of affordable housing. Leslie . Morphy, chief executive of Crisis, said: 'This continued rise in rough . sleeping is unacceptable – behind these statistics are more and more . real lives being devastated by the traumatic experience of homelessness. 'The Government must take . real steps to address the chronic lack of affordable housing and . urgently consider the impact its cuts are having, particularly to . housing benefit and local homelessness services.' Rough sleeping rate by local authority: The steepest regional rises were seen in the East Midlands and the South East, areas campaigners say are particularly affected by high housing costs and cuts to local services . Rough sleeping counts and estimates are single night snapshots of the number of people sleeping rough in local authority areas. Rough sleepers include people sleeping on the streets, in tents, doorways, parks, bus shelters or encampments, and also in buildings 'not designed for habitation', including stairwells, barns, sheds, car parks, cars, derelict boats, stations, or makeshift shelters made of cardboard boxes. But the definition excludes homeless people staying in hostels or shelters, people camping at holiday campsites or on organised protests, squatters or travellers. Overall the figures showed there were 2,414 rough sleepers in England in autumn last year, the latest period for which data is available.","England-wide figures show rough sleepers are up 37 per cent since 2010 .

"Electronic cigarette makers are in a race to design and buy new variations of the technology after becoming a billion-dollar industry. China is the front runner in the manufacture and development of so-called e-cigarette technology, as it's a country with over 300 million smokers. New . versions being patented include a 'pay as you go' computer-assisted device and others that can deliver caffeine . instead. In 2005 just eight e-cigarette inventions were described in . published patents. By 2012 the figure had jumped to 220. In 2005 just eight e-cigarette inventions were described in published patents... but by 2012 the figure had jumped to 220 (stock image) By last year there were over 500 inventions, according to an . analysis by the IP & Science business of Thomson Reuters. So far . this year the total has reached 650. (A single invention may be . covered by several patents.) The original technology, involving battery-powered heating . systems that vaporise nicotine-laced liquid, is credited to Hon . Lik, a Chinese medical researcher with a 20-a-day habit, in . 2003. His invention has since become so popular that the market is . now estimated to be worth $3.5 billion. Both big tobacco firms . and small entrepreneurs are falling over themselves to find new . ways to 'vape' - a verb suddenly so mainstream the Oxford . English Dictionary named it 2014's Word of the Year. Imperial Tobacco last year snapped up the patents . owned by the company Hon co-founded in a deal worth $75 million, . and is suing rivals for a range of alleged patent infringements. Part of the rush to create new devices can be explained by . the prospect of stiffer regulation on existing ones after the . World Health Organization said it wanted to see this, along with . bans on indoor use, advertising and sales to minors. While proponents see e-cigarettes as important tools for . harm reduction, critics fear the devices may instead fuel a new . wave of nicotine addiction and cite a lack of long-term . scientific evidence to support their safety. Of more than 2,000 e-cigarette inventions tracked by Thomson . Reuters, 64 percent originate in China, where over half of men . smoke. In second place is the United States, with 14 percent, . followed by South Korea with 9 percent. Some patented suggestions target smokers looking to regulate . their nicotine intake and their spending. While offerings . already on the market include thousands of e-liquid flavours . from menthol to marshmallow, and even a smartphone app to show . how much you are using, new patents go a step further. Tobacco giant Philip Morris International describes . an e-cigarette that would allow users to 'pay as you go' by . buying a certain number of doses via computer application . connected to their e-cigarette. This graphic shows the invention boom of the e-cigarette from the year 2000 to 2014 . Customers could also programme . the device to shut off after a certain number of puffs per use . to help limit intake. Other smaller players aim to deliver doses of caffeine and . other additives instead of nicotine. A unit of mCig Inc sells VitaCigs containing . vitamins and supplements such as valerian and collagen, while a . company called Energy Shisha sells a caffeinated vaping stick. Patents filed by others, including Fuma International, mention . tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active chemical in cannabis. In general, e-cigarette patents relate to systems for . heating and vaporising liquids, as well as for charging the . electronic systems, whether in a 'cigalike' device or a larger . 'tank' system, which doesn't resemble a cigarette but gives a . better 'vaping' experience. China's domination of the market reflects not only its huge . number of smokers but also a wider drive by the Chinese . government to forge a knowledge economy. By maximising patents . it hopes to replace the ubiquitous 'Made in China' label by . 'Designed in China.' Since 2011, China has been the world's top patent filer for . all inventions, according to the World Intellectual Property . Office. Its scientists and companies now lay claim to . intellectual property rights on everything from telecoms to . medicine. 'Patenting globally is rising significantly year on year, . driven by Chinese patenting generally,' said Bob Stembridge, . senior patent analyst at Thomson Reuters IP & Science. 'But I would say the e-cigarette field is growing faster . than the general trend, and the bias toward China is greater . than in global patenting.'","The e-cigarette market is now estimated to be worth $3.5 billion .

"An eight-year-old boy who was told he could have life-changing surgery to allow him to finally play football with his friends, has had the opportunity snatched away because of an ‘NHS shake-up’. Joseph Hill suffers from spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which affects his lower limbs and means he has to rely on a wheelchair. But he was given hope after being offered pioneering surgery - called Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy - on the NHS. Joesph (with his mother Angela) has spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which affects his lower limbs. He was told he could have surgery on the NHS but then got a letter saying the operation had been cancelled . The operation would involve cutting the nerves in his spine to relieve the severe tightness in his legs. The procedure, which was only previously offered in the U.S., became available at Joseph’s local hospital, the Leeds General Infirmary. Joseph’s mother Angela Hill, 36, said: ‘We were delighted. ‘We were starting to think about raising more than £50,000 to get to America to let him have the operation and then it became available just down the road. ‘We just couldn’t believe our luck.’ But after assessments and consultations in which doctors helped Joseph plan for his upcoming surgery, his hopes were promptly shattered by a letter delivered to his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. As a result, Joseph's family (parents Allan and Angela, and sister, Emma) were left with no choice but to try and raise the £20,000 needed for the surgery themselves . The Primary Care Trust, who had organised the operation, was abolished and NHS England who took over shattered the hopes of Joseph, and five other children, by cancelling their operations. Mrs Hill said: ‘One minute they were booking him in for the operation and Joseph was looking forward to being just like his friends, and the next a bog standard letter came through the door saying it had been cancelled. ‘He was really upset, and it was heart-breaking to see. ‘He thought he had everything coming to him and it was taken away from him in a heartbeat. ‘We are desperately trying to raise the money so he can have the operation before his ninth birthday.’ Joseph's story appeared on MailOnline on Monday, at which point the family had raised half of the target. Donations flooded in from generous readers and by Wednesday they had reached the target . The operation is now only available to Joseph if his family stumps up a staggering £20,000 for the crucial surgery, as well as paying further bills for his post-operative treatment. They must try and raise the money in less than six months, as it is necessary for Joseph to have the surgery before his birthday in January, while he is still young enough to benefit. Joseph was born prematurely at 34 weeks by emergency caesarean when his mother could no longer feel him moving. At six-weeks-old, his parents were told he had suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen and he was later diagnosed with spastic diplegia. Joesph needs to have the surgery before his ninth birthday in January or he will be too old to get the full benefits. He hopes he will eventually be able to play football with his friends . He has a walker to help him get around but he struggles with it, and needs a lot of physiotherapy to keep his muscles as loose as possible. Mrs Hill said: ‘He loves watching football but he can’t run around and play football with his friends. ‘He’s getting to the age where he’s starting to notice he’s different. He doesn’t like sports day because he can’t compete properly to win anything and he feels left out when he doesn’t get picked for things.’ The surgery would mean Joseph could finally have complete movement in his legs. Up until hearing about the surgery, families around the world have travelled to St Louis in America where experts routinely carry out the operation. ‘Trying to raise over £50,000 seemed like a very hard feat, and although £20,000 is obviously a big snip, it’s still a hard task,’ said Mrs Hill. ‘We’re doing everything we can, and Joseph is brilliant at thinking up fundraising ideas. He is having a game-athon soon to try and raise money. ‘We just want him to be able to run around with his friends and not feel like he is being held back.’ A spokeswoman for NHS England said they did not discuss individual cases but added: ‘NHS England’s current commissioning policy means that this procedure is not currently being routinely funded for patients in England. ‘Individual funding requests will continue to be considered where there are believed to be exceptional clinical grounds in an individual case.’ She said that NHS funding may be provided later this financial year for a small group of patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment. Joseph and his family can be supported in their fundraising at www.justgiving.com/steppingforwardforjoseph . Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs. Source: SCOPE .","Joseph Hill has spastic diplegia, cerebral palsy that affects the legs .

"The creators of instant messaging service WhatsApp can now comfortably call themselves billionaires after signing a $19 billion deal with Facebook. But the duo's road to becoming billionaires several times over has been filled with humble beginnings and setbacks . Koum, 37, who co-founded the app with Brian Acton in 2009 co-founded WhatsApp in 2009, and five years later, is now estimated to now be worth about $6.8 billion. But at one point he was a teenage immigrant who lived on food stamps. The 'long time'-friend of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was just 16 when he moved to the U.S. from Ukraine. Scroll down for video . $19 billion richer this morning: Brian Acton (left) and Jan Koum at Whatsapp's family headquarters in Mountain View California last May . WhatsApp founders Brian Acton, left, and Jan Koum at their company headquarters in Mountain View, California . The creators of instant messaging service WhatsApp can now comfortably call themselves billionaires after signing a $19 billion deal with Facebook . Rags to riches: WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum, 37, has become a billionaire after selling his chat-app to Facebook, where he will now become a member of the board . He was raised in a rural community, in a house with no hot water or electricity, and when the family moved overseas, his mother packed their suitcases with school supplies to save money. Over 450million active users per month . 70 per cent of users active on any given day . Messaging volume approaching the entire global telecom SMS volume . Service adds more than 1 million new registered users per day . 600million photos uploaded each day . 200million voice messages sent each day . As a young immigrant, Koum and his . mother had to rely on food stamps, and in a poignant tribute to his . humble past, he chose to sign the deal with Facebook at the same welfare office in Mountain View where he used to queue to get food stamps. The offices for WhatsApp, an instant messaging service with 450million active users which Koum created with Brian Acton in 2009, are located only a few blocks from the welfare office. On Wednesday, Acton and Koum stood outside the welfare building as they signed the deal with Facebook, only this time Koum was able to drive there in his Porsche. His humble beginnings appear to have instilled in him a strong work ethic and dislike for egotism - WhatsApp may be a global phenomenon but it has no sign at its office. 'I can’t see a reason for there being a sign. It’s an ego boost,' he told Forbes. 'We all know where we work.' Koum and Acton developed WhatsApp in . coffee shops and at their homes. It took just a few years for the app to . be worth billions of dollars. Facebook . has paid $12 billion in stock and $4 billion in cash for WhatsApp, and . the founders and employees will be granted $3 billion in restricted . stock that will vest over four years after the $19 billion deal closes. Humble beginnings: Jan Koum signed the $19billion deal at the welfare office where he used to collect food stamps, located just a few blocks from WhatsApp's officers in Mountain View, California . Deal: Koum returned to this Mountain View welfare offices to sign the Facebook deal . Boom: The free instant messaging service created in 2009 has grown faster than Facebook in its five years, and now has more than 450 million monthly users around the world. Facebook has completed its purchase of mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to $22 billion (£13.7 billion) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the acquisition on his Facebook page, acknowledging his long-standing friendship with Koum in particular. 'I've known Jan for a long time, and I know that we both share the vision of making the world more open and connected. Rejected: Brian Acton was turned down by both Twitter and Facebook before creating WhatsApp . 'I'm particularly happy that Jan has agreed to join the Facebook board and partner with me to shape Facebook's future as well as WhatsApp's.' Less is known about Acton's background, although his CV ticks a lot of boxes for a typical employee in the tech industry - Stanford University, Apple and Yahoo! But surprisingly Acton was actually turned down for a job with Facebook, the very company that has signed the deal with Whatsapp, in 2009. In . a tweet on his Twitter account at the time, he had posted: 'Facebook . turned me down. It was a great opportunity to connect with some . fantastic people. Looking forward to life's next adventure.' Twitter also appears to have turned Acton down for a job in the same year. Koum has promised that despite the billion-dollar deal, the app will continue to function in the same way. In an official statement posted on his own blog, Koum says: 'Almost five years ago we started WhatsApp with a simple mission: building a cool product used globally by everybody. 'Nothing else mattered to us. 'Today we are announcing a partnership with Facebook that will allow us to continue on that simple mission. 'Doing this will give WhatsApp the flexibility to grow and expand, while giving me, Brian, and the rest of our team more time to focus on building a communications service that’s as fast, affordable and personal as possible. 'Here’s what will change for you, our users: nothing.' Education: - Mountain View High School - 'Barely graduated', 1995- San Jose State University - BSc Computer Science, 'Dropped out' Work Experience:- Yahoo! - Security and Operations Engineering and later Infrastructure Engineering, 1998 - 2007- Whatsapp - Senior Tweet Manager, 'building cool s*** used by millions of people', 2009 - Now .

Other: Last tweet, posted in January 2012, was 'whatsapp'. Proud moment: Jan Koum, pictured at a digital conference in January, described the deal as 'incredible'. Forbes estimates that Koum held about a 45 per cent stake in the company, while co-founder Brian Acton's stake was over 20 per cent . Happy news: Mark Zuckerberg made the announcement on his Facebook page (where else) last night and revealed that he has known WhatsApp founder Jan for 'a long time' Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp is . likely to be the highest price ever paid for a tech startup, knocking . Microsoft's $8.5billion purchase of Skype in 2011, out of the park. ‘The . size of this deal is really massive and it will get people talking . about a bubble,’ Greg Sterling at Opus Research told AFP. Facebook has said that it will keep WhatsApp as a separate service, just as it did with Instagram, which it bought for $1bn. As well as securing WhatsApp in a £19billion deal, Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook has purchased some of the top social network companies out there: . 1. Instagram (photo sharing) $1bn - April 2012 . 2. Face.com (face recognition) $100m - June 2012 . 3. Atlas (advertiser suite) 'less than $100m' - February 2013 . 4. Snaptu (Mobile App developer) $60–70m - March 2011 . 5. FriendFeed (platform to share activities over several social networks) $47.5m - August 2009 . 6. Friendster patents (social network patents, friend-of-friend connections) $40m - May 2010 . 7. ConnectU (social network) $31m - June 2008 . WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users. In comparison, Twitter had 241 million users at the end of 2013. Mark Zuckerberg says WhatsApp is on path to reach a billion users. 'The combination of WhatsApp and Facebook will allow us to connect many more people round the world,' Zuckerberg said. 'It's the only app we've ever seen that has grown more quickly than Facebook itself.' 'This is an incredible moment for . me,' Koum said. 'Every day over 19 billion messages are sent, with over 1 million . new users every day. We wanted it to be simple, and a better service . than SMS.' Facebook promised . to keep the WhatsApp brand and service, and pledged a $1 billion cash . break-up fee were the deal to fall through. Zuckerberg . said he was not planning to put ads on WhatsApp and Koum also pledged . not to add adverts to the service, which makes money from a subscription . model. 'We think advertising is not the way to go - we create a direct relationship with customers,' Koum said. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp would operate in the same way as Instagram, as a separate firm. 'It would be pretty stupid of us to interfere. Our strategy is to grow and connect people. Once we get to 2-3 billion people there are ways we can monetise. 'Now we want to focus on growing users. I don't think ads are the right way here.' European Union regulators approved the deal on Friday, clearing the way for the acquisition which some in the telecoms industry had opposed. WhatsApp is still growing and is predicted to have a billion users soon. It will continue as a separate service under Facebook .","Jan Koum, 37, moved to California from the Ukraine when he was 16 .

"Iain Duncan Smith’s officials have attacked a Church-backed campaign that claims his benefit changes are forcing people to go to food banks. In a striking billboard advert  that says ‘Britain Isn’t Eating’, the charity Church Action on Poverty uses the famous image from the Conservatives’ 1979 election poster, ‘Labour Isn’t Working’. The highly political charity poster features the same long line of people used to illustrate dole queues under Jim Callaghan’s ailing government, but this time places them outside a food bank. Provocative: A Church advertising campaign blames benefits changes for more people visiting food banks . Copycat: The Church handout echoes the Tory election poster famously designed by Saatchi and Saatchi . It reads: ‘Thousands are going hungry because of benefit changes. Call for urgent action.’ But a spokesman for Mr Duncan Smith’s Department for Work and Pensions said there was ‘no robust evidence’ welfare reforms are linked to increased use of food banks. The charity, supported by the Church of England and other churches, says on its website that half a million people used aid from food banks this year. Iain Duncan Smith's department has said there is no evidence that welfare changes are behind increased use of food banks . It claims ‘the single most common reason for people to need food aid is that their benefits have been changed, delayed or stopped’. The figures appear to come from the Trussell Trust, which runs 400 food banks in Britain. Its chairman, Chris Mould, has been accused by Mr Duncan Smith of ‘scaremongering’ and ‘political messaging’ by claiming the use of them is linked to welfare reforms. In a letter leaked yesterday the Work and Pensions Secretary rejected the idea, writing: ‘I strongly refute this claim and would politely ask you to stop scaremongering in this way. ‘I understand that a feature of your business model must require you to continuously achieve publicity, but I’m concerned that you are now seeking to do this by making your political opposition to welfare reform overtly clear.’ He told Mr Mould that the DWP’s record in processing welfare claims had improved under the Coalition and would do further when Universal Credit – the merging of six benefits into one payment – is up and running. The DWP says 92 per cent of benefits are processed on time, compared with 86 per cent in 2009-10 under the last government. Labour MPs have repeatedly used increases in the number of food banks as evidence of a ‘cost of living crisis’. But a DWP spokesman said that if three new food banks are opening every week, as the Trussell Trust says, then ‘it’s not surprising more people are using them’. He added: ‘Our welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities with Universal Credit making three million households better off – the majority of these from the bottom two fifths of the income scale.’ Charity Church Action on Poverty claims that the single biggest reason given by people for visiting food banks is that their benefits have either been cut or stopped . Tory MP Mark Pritchard wrote on Twitter last night: ‘If some parts of the Church of England preached a little more gospel and a little less politics – perhaps [the] Church would be in a better place.’ For the launch of the Britain Isn’t Eating campaign, Church Action on Poverty said on its website: ‘The explosion in food poverty and the use of food banks is a national disgrace. It undermines the UK’s commitment to ensuring all its citizens have access to food – one of the most basic human rights.’ A Church of England spokesman said the charity was independent but shared some personnel, adding: ‘There are more than 400 food banks up and down the country … many supported or run by local churches … Supporting those in need is a core gospel value for Christians.’ Mr Mould denied that his organisation was politically motivated and said Mr Duncan Smith has refused to meet him to discuss the issue. Sir Tony Baldry, Tory MP for Banbury, said a survey this year found 62 per cent of food bank users did so because of low income, 42 per cent because of benefit changes and 35 per cent as a result of benefit delays.","Charity Church Action on Poverty has created the billboard .

"Downing Street last night backed a scathing attack on the internet giants by the new boss of GCHQ. Number Ten said the Prime Minister shared the concerns of Robert Hannigan, who accused firms such as Twitter and Facebook of turning into ‘the command and control networks of choice’ for terrorists. Mr Hannigan said some US-based tech firms were ‘in denial’ about how their services were being used by fanatics to facilitate mass murder and said they must do more to help GCHQ, MI5 and MI6. Number Ten said the Prime Minister shared the concerns of Robert Hannigan, who accused firms such as Twitter and Facebook of turning into ‘the command and control networks of choice’ for terrorists . GCHQ director Robert Hannigan (left) said internet firms needed to allow the state to police on-line traffic. NSA leaker Ed Snowden (right), revealed intensive collaboration between spy agencies and internet companies . He highlighted how Islamic State fanatics in particular were using social networking sites to spread their message of poison – sending 40,000 Tweets a day. But, rather than providing more co-operation with the security services, the tech companies have become less helpful in the wake of the revelations about State surveillance by the CIA fugitive Edward Snowden. The new head of GCHQ accused firms such as Twitter (left) and Facebook (right) of turning into ‘the command and control networks of choice’ for terrorists . The Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) said Mr Hannigan’s comments were ‘wrong’ and ‘ill-judged’. But the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said Mr Cameron ‘very much shares the view that’s being expressed around the use of internet access technologies by violent and extremist groups amongst others, and the need to do more’. In his article in the Financial Times, Mr Hannigan said the tech firms must understand that mobile technology and smartphones have massively increased the options available to terrorists. He continued: ‘Techniques for encrypting messages or making them anonymous which were once the preserve of the most sophisticated criminals or nation states now come as standard. These are supplemented by freely-available programs and apps adding extra layers of security, many of them proudly advertising that they are “Snowden approved”.’ An aerial view of Government Communications Headquarters in Benhall, in the suburbs of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire: The agency's new chief says internet firms need to open up even more to state spies . Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of Westminster’s Intelligence and Security Committee, backed the GCHQ boss – saying some of the technology firms had an ‘amateurish’ approach to monitoring alleged criminal behaviour. He even accused the firms of obstructing security efforts with systems that prevent intelligence agencies from being able to find out lawfully ‘what’s being said from one terrorist source to another’, he told Radio 4’s World At One. But ISPA Secretary General Nicholas Lansman criticised Mr Hannigan and instead called for a ‘full public debate’ to determine the balance between the right to privacy and need for security. He added: ‘The internet has opened amazing opportunities for communication and business. To mis-characterise it as a tool for terrorists is short-sighted. Internet companies have and will work with authorities to tackle unlawful activity. ‘Ultimately, the public will be the arbiters of where the line should be drawn between privacy and security. For this to happen an honest and frank debate is required based on the full facts. The opinion piece from GCHQ falls short of this.’ They help our mortal enemies — but couldn’t care less says PROFESSOR ANTHONY GLEES . Historically, senior GCHQ personnel have largely remained in the shadows. But in remarkably robust language, Robert Hannigan, the new director of GCHQ, has warned how the big, mainly American, technology companies such as Google have singularly failed to crack down on the disturbing use of internet sites by terrorists, especially Islamic extremists bent on the destruction of our civilisation. From my own work in this field, I know Hannigan is absolutely right. Islamic State fighters are the first terrorist generation of the internet age, and the jihadists are becoming ever more sophisticated in their exploitation of computer technology. Jihadi John's videos were put on-line . They manage their YouTube videos and craft their Facebook entries to gain maximum impact and to taunt our security agencies every second of every hour. They understand how to get round protective firewalls and spam filters that have been constructed with huge expense and hard work. Incredibly, during their recent advance on Mosul in Iraq, IS agents sent 40,000 tweets a day. But what is particularly chilling is how western self-styled crusaders for internet freedom, such as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (a former contractor for the US National Security Agency), have ended up helping the jihadists by revealing so much about the methods of British, European and American intelligence agencies. Snowden leaked details via The Guardian about the extent to which GCHQ could monitor electronically transmitted messages and its capacity to search the vast amounts of data to identify information that might help them defeat terrorists. Indeed, in a development that perfectly illustrates the extent to which our enemies have been technically assisted by these self-righteous leakers, some programmes and apps with high levels of encryption are now advertised as ‘Snowden-approved’. Six weeks ago, I wrote in this paper about the enormous harm done to western security by Snowden and Assange. Now we have confirmation from the head of GCHQ about the extent of that damage. The great danger is that we are at risk as a result of the behaviour of these self-indulgent poseurs who prattle about human rights but care nothing for our genuine freedoms. That is why it is so vital that intelligence agencies are given the tools they need to protect us from our mortal enemies. In practice, that requires the internet giants to face up to their social responsibilities, instead of colluding, however inadvertently, with the jihadists. What is particularly chilling is how western self-styled crusaders for internet freedom, such as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (above) and Edward Snowden, have ended up helping the jihadists . Only a few days ago, for example, the Raqqa Media Centre, an activist collective affiliated to IS in Syria, was found to be using Facebook to distribute images of a beheading, accompanied by a message that glorified this atrocity. In their reluctance to help the security agencies, these internet firms have carried their much-trumpeted scruples about online privacy and freedom to a dangerous excess, thereby enabling the extremists to act with impunity. Indeed, Apple and Google have arrogantly announced that they have created operating systems that allow people to permanently lock their smartphones. Only the user knows the security code. Apple and Google say they can’t break that code, and nor could they help government agencies unlock phones owned by people suspected of having links to terror or criminal groups, even if compelled to do so by court order. Apple (left) and Google (right) have arrogantly announced that they have created operating systems that allow people to permanently lock their smartphones . Similarly, IT companies routinely sell high-tech encryption packages that allow people to surf the web anonymously. Of course, such equipment attracts people who have something to hide. Bristling with outrage, some of the internet providers seem to enjoy challenging the intelligence agencies. Recently, seven of them – including GreenNet in the UK and the aptly named Chaos Computer Club in Germany – joined forces to take legal action against GCHQ over its attempt to investigate secretive networks on the ‘dark side’ of the web. This is just part of a formidable nexus, made up of tech companies, internet providers and civil liberties groups, along with supporters of Snowden and Assange, which has joined up to fight attempts by governments to tackle online terrorism. They are supported by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, widely regarded as the founding father of the web, who has said that allowing intelligence agencies to target data held on the internet would be tantamount ‘to the destruction of human rights’. But it is absolutely vital that we fight this skewed view of freedom. The irony that the internet providers fail to notice is that we will have no liberty at all if the jihadists triumph. For its part, I believe, our government has been far too feeble in taking on the companies and dogmatic libertarians, not least because the Conservative Party – keen to burnish its modernising credentials – has strong connections with Silicon Valley. Indeed, Rachel Whetstone, a close friend of David Cameron and married to his ex-policy chief Steve Hilton, is vice-president of Google. The EU, too, has been equally feeble and deluded, as shown by the appalling decision by the European Court of Justice – in the name of upholding ‘the fundamental right to privacy’ – to let people demand that internet providers remove their personal online records from Google searches. Far from being a blow for freedom, this showed an Orwellian tendency to rewrite the past to suit wrongdoers. What’s more, there is another aspect of ministerial hypocrisy. While the Government shows deference to high-tech giants, despite mounting evidence that they profit from terrorism, it has cracked down on the press – with the Leveson inquiry – although newspapers have done a heroic job in exposing wrongdoing in this country. The views of the new head of GCHQ should serve as a clarion call for change. Despite all the phoney outrage from libertarians, Snowden and tech companies, most British people recognise the incontrovertible truth that we can never have freedom without security.","GCHQ's Robert Hannigan said some US-based tech firms were ‘in denial’

"A customer was so frustrated with the dreadful shopping experience he has endured at an east London Tesco Express he set up a picture blog mocking the farcical conditions. James Allan, a PR professional, ranted over food being left on the floor, missing or out-of-date goods, non-existent staff and a faulty alarm ruining his sleep at the branch in Kingsland Road, Haggerston, and posted pictures to hammer home his exasperation. 'The Worst Place On Earth' came into existence at 1am on Tuesday while Mr Allan, 30, was being kept awake by the store's alarm, which was going off every 30 minutes. Haphazard: Trolleys block aisles and food is dumped on the floor in these pictures . It details goods dumped in busy walkways, chilled food left on normal shelves, unhelpful staff and a complete lack of the most basic produce. He said: 'I’ve been taking pictures in there for a few months because even though I’m a big fan of Tesco I think this one store is letting them down. 'The burglar alarm was going off every three minutes again, I couldn’t sleep and had nothing better to do so I set it up as a bit of a vent.' Stock control: Empty shelves were a frequent problem for Mr Allan. Someone wrote: 'Tesco, every little (very, very little) helps' Shelves lie empty while goods are dumped on the floor and basic essentials often run out . His posts are all in capital letters and . include observations such as: 'SOMEONE TOOK EVERYTHING OFF THE SHELVES . AND PUT IT ON THE FLOOR. AT 6:30 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. 'ONE WOMAN ON HER PHONE KICKED A BAG OF FLOUR BY ACCIDENT AND NEARLY FELL OVER. THERE WAS NO ONE TO COMPLAIN TO.' Other peeved customers also joined in with their own experiences. One posted: 'It’s like they looked at the all the cliches about the demographic of an east London postcode and thought, yes we’ll stock out of date turkey twizzlers and sell stuff that has been kicked around the floor AND NO ONE WILL NOTICE. 'Well, hopefully the CEO of Tesco will notice now.' Meal deal anyone?: Lager nestles with sandwiches in the Tesco Express. Right, James Allan, who started the blog out of sheer frustration . Banished: The comments read: 'THESE PRINGLES HAD BEEN OSTRACISED BY THE OTHERS FOR BEING TOO PLAIN' and 'As usual, Tesco have kindly taken the liberty of deciding my diet/hunger strike starts today' One shopper lamented: 'I went in for potatoes but all they had was this long thing. I don't know what it is but I'm going back tonight to see if any further reductions have been made' Another said: 'I tried to buy carrots the other day for carrot cake at about 2pm, couldn’t find any. 'Decided to investigate further and look at the tags to see where the carrots normally live. None of the bins had carrot tags on them. None. 'Eight different varieties of onion, no carrots?' The blog soon went viral and Tesco bosses quickly got in touch to assure Mr Allan they would amend the situation. Mr Allan told the Evening Standard: 'I put it out on Facebook and Twitter and didn’t really think much more of it, but because of the industry I work in it got picked up and one thing led to another.' A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the blog and agree this store has not met our high standards. We are working with the store to make sure we offer the best possible service for our customers.' 'THEY’VE STARTED MAKING CHICANES TO ENTERTAIN THE PUNTERS WHEN THEY CAN’T FIND A SINGLE THING THEY WERE SHOPPING FOR… A LETHAL CHICANE OF MIXED GROCERIES. THE SECURITY GUARD IS THE UMPIRE.' 'SOMEONE FILLED A BASKET WITH PICKLED ONIONS AND LEFT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AISLE.

"A high profile gay rights activist and Democrat fundraiser has been charged with sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy with his boyfriend. Terry Bean, 66, co-founded two of the biggest national campaign groups and raised more than $500,000 for Barack Obama's 2012 re-election bid. He was arrested at his home in southwest Portland on Wednesday and indicted with two counts of third-degree sodomy and one count of third-degree sex abuse. Charged: Terry Bean, a prominent gay rights activist who raised $500,000 for Obama, has been charged with sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy with his boyfriend in a hotel last year . Defense: Bean's lawyer claims he is the victim of an 'extortion ring' to ruin his reputation . Bean's lawyers insist he is the victim of an 'extortion ring', which they claim involves several men 'known to law enforcement'. The alleged incident involved a sexual encounter with a 15-year-old boy in 2013 in Eugene, Oregon, police said. His ex-boyfriend, Kiah Loy Lawson, 25, was also arrested and charged, according to USA Today. Bean is a revered character among the gay rights activist community and with the Democratic Party, Oregon Live reports. He helped to form the Human Rights Campaign and the Gay And Lesbian Victory Fund. The trained broker was forced to defend himself earlier this year after his co-accused, Lawson, revealed Bean secretly filmed their sexual encounters. However, his lawyer Kristin Winemiller has lambasted claims he abused a teenage boy. Co-accused: Kiah Loy Lawson, who is also charged, last year accused Bean of secretly filming their sex . Winemiller released this statement: 'Terry Bean is a highly respected community leader who has devoted his life to bettering our community. 'Over the course of several months in 2013-2014 Terry was the victim of an extortion ring led by several men known to law enforcement. 'This current arrest is connected to the ongoing investigation of that case in which Mr Bean has fully cooperated. 'No allegations against Terry Bean should be taken at face value. 'We look forward to the opportunity to clear his name.' Bean was bailed on Wednesday for 10 per cent of his $50,000 bond, Oregon Live claimed.","Terry Bean, 66, co-founded Human Rights Campaign and Gay And Lesbian Victory Fund before putting more than $500,000 behind Obama in 2012 .

"Rule number one about pulling off a successful heist is that you don't tell anyone - and you definitely don't post a picture of yourself online with all the stolen goods. Unfortunately, this rule was lost on one hapless opportunist, who posted a picture of himself on Facebook with various items - suggesting that he stole them from vandalised stores during the week's rioting. It was one of the more astounding posts that police claim encouraged violence and theft across the capital over the weekend and early this morning. Police also say sites such as Twitter - as well as BlackBerry handsets - were used to co-ordinate attacks on police and tell potential rioters where to find violence hotspots. Don't show your Facebook: A brazen Londoner posted a picture of himself with items still in their packaging. Police say such postings encouraged other people to join in the looting . BlackBerry handsets, owned by more . than a third of British teenagers, allow users to send one-to-many . messages to their network of contacts, connected by BlackBerry Messenger . PIN codes. Unlike conventional texts or calls, as well as Twitter or Facebook, many BlackBerry messages are untraceable by the authorities. Hundreds of people on Twitter posted pictures of a burning police car and evidence of looting, with many showing their approval of the violence and vandalism and encouraging others to join in. Police say that many of the tweets have pictures of the violence in a show of bravado, and have now warned that identified Twitter users could face arrest for inciting violence. Deputy . Assistant Commissioner Stephen Kavanagh confirmed officers were looking . at the website as part of investigations into widespread looting and . rioting. A two-minute film of a police car . being trashed by rioters was posted on YouTube to a rap soundtrack. The . clip finished with the words: 'The enemy isn't your own people, the . enemy is the police.' Looter: Pictures put on Twitter showed some of the rioters using shopping trolleys to carry away stolen items including TVs and mobile phones . Police are scrutinising tweets and . messages on internet forums and could press charges if they consider . they amount to incitement to riot. Metropolitan Police Commander Adrian . Hanstock said: 'There . has been some speculation on social media sites and we are actively . posting accurate information to correct this. 'What we would ask for is if anyone . has information about those who committed these offences or anyone . intending to, then please let us know.' Police say there was clear evidence of rioters . co-ordinating their attacks using the social networking site, stirring . up emotions against the police and urging others to join in the . violence. Tweets . reported specific locations of clashes with police. One, from a user . calling himself 'English Frank', seemed to be encouraging rioters to . kill police officers. Stirring up emotion: Pictures of burning police cars were put on sites such as Twitter and YouTube, with many comments revelling in the damage caused and carrying anti-authority sentiments . The tweet read: 'Everyone up and roll to Tottenham f*** the 5-0. I hope 1 dead tonight.' Another Twitter user, 'Sonny Twag', tweeted: 'Want to roll Tottenham to loot. I do want a free TV. Who wudn't.' Yet . another, 'DannyWonders', tweeted: 'Jewellry Shop In Green Lanes Getting . Robbed Right In Front Of My Eyes<looool get involved!' Shops selling luxury goods were the obvious targets of the looters. Police said the majority of opportunistic thieves were young - aged in . their teens and early twenties. Mobile . phone and jewellery shops were damaged and plundered amid the violence, . and at least one Twitter image showed a young man wheeling a trolley . full of looted goods. Looting quickly spread in Tottenham, with high-street giants Currys, Argos, Comet and PC World the most popular among thieves. Support pages: Online pages of support for Mark Duggan, shot dead on Thursday by police, feature anti-government or anti-authority messages . Casual shopping: Suspected looters carry boxed shoes from a JD Sports store in Tottenham Hale Retail Park, and even have time to look at their choices.  Police admitted they were too stretched to stop many thieves . The Barclays Bank branch in . Tottenham High Road was targeted, with rioters smashing their way into . the branch and its cashpoint machine ripped from the wall and emptied. But Twitter was also being used to warn . people away from the area, with many tweets telling peaceful residents . of the affected areas to keep away from flashpoints. Despite the quickly escalating violence, the protest had begun peacefully. Family and friends of Mark Duggan, the father-of-four shot dead by police on Thursday night, had marched from the . Broadwater Farm estate to Tottenham police station to demand answers. They arrived at about 5.15pm on Saturday, but were made to wait for hours before anyone addressed them. When an officer finally emerged, he said a more senior policeman would have to answer their questions. Defiance: A masked man holds his arms in the air during the middle of Saturday's riot. Police say that social networking sites such as Twitter were used to co-ordinate attacks against officers . Outnumbered: A lone man stands in front of a group of riot police. Tweets told where riot hotspots were and encouraged people to join in the violence . As night fell around 8pm, the crowd had doubled and younger . men sporting hoodies and covering their faces began to arrive on the . back of the rumours that a 16-year-old girl had been attacked by police. Some . witnesses claimed she approached officers to ask questions, but then . threw stones at them and one struck her to the ground with a baton. One . local said: 'There was a stand-off with the police which was tense, but . not violent. But this changed when an officer hit a woman with a baton. She was very . distressed and it angered the crowd who started throwing rocks, pint . glasses and poles at the police. Then it all got really out of hand.' Police yesterday said they were aware of an incident when a teenage girl was asked to leave the area but said no baton was used. Inferno: Flames rage through the Carpetright building in Tottenham on Saturday night, with fire crews prevented from tackling it in case they were attacked by rioters . With . tensions fraying, the Duggan family group, which included his fiancee Semone . Wilson, and friends, decided to leave as some youths started smashing . and burning two police cars. It soon turned into a full-scale pitched battle, spilling out along Tottenham High Road. By . 11pm a double-decker bus was in flames, and crowds gathered to jeer . police. Shops were smashed, including a Carpetright and Aldi supermarket . which were both set alight. Scores of youths were seen walking up and down the streets with TVs, stereos, mobile phones and food – all stolen. Others were posing in front of burnt-out cars for photos and some were even getting snaps showing off their loot. Through the night, rioters and . looters littered the streets. The violence spread to Wood Green, Enfield . and Brixton, where more shops were smashed, cars burned . and goods stolen. As the violence escalated, further tweets inflated the situation. One said: . 'F*** the electronics, them Turkish jewellers needed to get robbed.' And . a post on an internet forum simply read: 'Everything must go.' Photographs . of looters pushing . shopping trolleys full of stolen goods - and one incredibly brazen . looter posing with his booty, his face clearly identifiable - were also . posted online. In all, the looting carried on  unabated for three hours before any control was regained by police. Stores including Boots, JD Sports, . O2, Curry's, Argos, Orange, PC World and Comet at a shopping centre in . Tottenham Hale were hit badly, as looters swiped anything they could, . including breaking into cash registers. Yesterday Tottenham High Road . remained awash with thieves who even queued patiently to steal clothes . from a sports shop.

"As relief efforts continue for the thousands of Northeasterners impacted by Hurricane Sandy, a new storm on Wednesday threatens to bring chilly temperatures and even snow to the wearied low lying coastal areas where residents are just beginning to pick up the pieces from the damage of last week. The National Weather Service is warning that the nor'easter could bring high winds of up to 60mph, rain and possible flooding, in addition to a very real danger from falling limbs from trees already beaten down by the previous superstorm. The unnamed storm is moving up along the Atlantic coast from Florida and is set to join with a weather system moving East from the Midwest but some forecasters project the storm could veer offshore, which would be a welcome relief to the battered coast. Scroll down for video . Wet: The nor'easter threatens to hit the East Coast on Wednesday, just as the region tries to pick up the pieces after superstorm Sandy . White November? The storm could bring up to six inches of snow to some areas in the Northeast on Wednesday, forecasters predict . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie warned that the severe weather could mean residents who just had their power restored, could once again be living without electricity. There is 'nothing we can do to stop the storms,' he said. Similarly, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said some residents living in neighborhoods at risk of flooding will be encouraged to relocate until the storm passes. In a press conference on Tuesday, Bloomberg warned the city would be 'on a high wind watch and coastal flood watch beginning Wednesday morning through late Wednesday night.' The mayor projected the city could receive an inch of rain, which could turn to sleet and even possibly snow. 'Keep in mind, these are forecasts and forecasts, as we know, change as you get closer to the event,' he added. Though there are no forced evacuations, he said New York police will be patrolling at risk areas to encourage the elderly and families with children to evacuate. Next up: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a press conference on Tuesday to warn New Yorkers, just recovering from Hurricane Sandy, of the upcoming nor'easter . Not again: Governor Chris Christie (at a press conference on Monday in Keansburg, New Jersey) warned that some Jersey residents who just had their power restored, could lose electricity in the storm on Wednesday . 'We can expect winds of up to 25 to 35 mph and gusts rising to 45 to 55 mph, with the highest winds occurring late Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday night,' he continued, adding that the strong winds will make it feel around 10 degrees colder than the listed temperature. The city will close all parks, playgrounds and beaches, given the threat of falling tree branches, he added. Travelers flying to and from the East Coast will also experience delays and cancellations. United Airlines announced on Tuesday . afternoon that it will suspend most service to and from the New York area . between noon Wednesday and noon Thursday due to the winter . storm. Storm surges along the coasts of New Jersey and New York are expected to reach 3 feet, only half to a third of what Hurricane Sandy caused last week, National Weather Service meteorologist Lauren Masters said. Out in the cold: Volunteers serve hot soup to residents in Staten Island, New York on Tuesday, many of whom still do not have power after superstorm Sandy hit last week . Cleanup: The upcoming storm threatened to thwart cleanup work (like the efforts to move debris after the storm in Wall, New Jersey on Tuesday) Coastal Virginia could also get a surge of 2 or 3 feet, causing minor flooding on the east side of Chesapeake Bay during high tides on Wednesday morning and evening, he said. However, most of the storm's rain will stay offshore. Up to an inch of snow may fall in northeastern New Jersey and the lower Hudson River valley, weather service meteorologist Mike Layer said. Central Massachusetts and western Connecticut also could get an inch or two of snow, according to Masters. Along the Jersey shore, which was devastated by last week's superstorm, there was some relief that damage projections from the nor'easter have been scaled back. But there was still concern about the ocean barreling past beaches and dunes that were largely washed away.

"Stuart Gulliver, chief executive officer of HSBC Holdings Plc, is to be handed allowances worth £32,000-a-week to avoid the bonus cap imposed by Brussels . The boss of global banking giant HSBC . is to be given allowances worth £32,000 a week, in addition to his salary of . £1.2million, in a bid to avoid a bonus cap imposed on Brussels. The . bank was yesterday under fire for handing an £8million pay package, including bonuses, to . its chief executive Stuart Gulliver in 2013 and giving £1million awards to . 239 staff – up from 204 in 2012 and 192 in 2011. And . it became the first bank to reveal detailed plans to avoid a bonus cap . imposed by Brussels. The bank is providing Mr Gulliver with a £1.7million 'fixed pay allowance', which will be paid in shares every three months in addition to his salary, The Guardian has reported. This will mean he is paid at least £4.2million a year, compared to the £2.5million he earns now. The shares, which cannot be sold for five years, will also be handed as allowances to 111 of the top bankers at HSBC. Extra payments in cash are also expected to be handed to another 554 staff. The EU rules . introduced in January ban banks from paying bonuses of more than one . year’s annual salary – or up to two years if shareholders approve. Cathy .

The only way to rein in bankers’ remuneration is to make banks pay . their fair share to society.’ Frances O’Grady of the Trades Union Congress said the payouts were another example of boardroom greed. She . added: ‘It would be great if banks put the same effort into lending to . small businesses and investing in infrastructure as they do to getting . round EU rules on boardroom bonuses.’ The bank was yesterday under fire for handing an £8million pay package, including bonuses, to its chief executive Stuart Gulliver in 2013 and giving £1million awards to 239 staff . And . Luke Hildyard of the High Pay Centre said: ‘HSBC are obviously not . remotely bothered what ordinary people think. For all their bleating, . the banks have not provided any evidence to prove that they would lose . staff to rivals from outside the EU if pay and bonuses were reduced.' Mr Gulliver has also sounded the death knell for traditional high street banking, after saying his staff will in future cater for ‘higher . value activities’ such as mortgages and share trading instead of . handling cash and cheque payments. He also predicts that city areas will have the lion’s share of a reduced number of branches. Insisting that most younger people bank online, he said: ‘You won’t be offering a branch walk-in facility for what can be described as a banking facility because the footfall won’t be there. ‘You will end up with a smaller number of branches than today but you will still have branches. ‘They will be in different parts of the country to reflect demographic changes that have taken place.’ Cathy Jamieson MP said the only way to rein in bankers' remuneration is to make banks pay their fair share to society . The chief executive’s views sparked a furious reaction from campaigners, who accused HSBC of prioritising profitable customers and betraying its claim to be the world’s ‘local bank’. Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: ‘Being able to access your cash and pay bills are essential services which must be easily available to everyone. ‘The shrinking number of high street bank branches combined with the industry’s growing reliance on online services mean access has become  increasingly difficult for many older people.’ Over a third of pensioners have mobility problems that make travelling to their nearest branch difficult, according to the charity. Derek French, of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, said: ‘HSBC has already been closing branches at a faster rate than its three main competitors in the UK and  leaving rural communities and market towns without any banking presence at all. ‘This disregard for the needs of . vulnerable individuals and loyal small businesses on the part of HSBC, . one of the world’s largest and most profitable banks, is appalling. Barclays angered politicians and shareholders this month when it confirmed it had hiked its bonus pool by 10 per cent to £2.38billion, despite a fall in profits. The Treasury has sided with the banks and launched a legal challenge against the EU pay curbs. Announcing its latest financial results, HSBC posted a 9 per cent boost in profits to £13.6billion last year. It has set aside an extra £450million in the final three months of the year to compensate customers mis-sold PPI, taking its total bill for the scandal so far to £1.9billion. The banking group, which owns the First Direct and M&S Bank, has 16million customers in the UK and 1,150 branches. It closed 47 last year. Mr Gulliver is the latest financier to fuel fears that branches will become much less common on high streets. This month Antony Jenkins, who is chief executive of Barclays, was criticised for claiming that shutting down branches and moving more customers to online banking would lead to a ‘better customer experience’. There are fears that up to a quarter of his bank’s 1,560 branches are under threat.","HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver being handed allowances worth £32,000 a week .

"A 17-year-old U.S. citizen and known hit man for a Mexican drug cartel has finished his three-year, juvenile-offender term for homicide, kidnapping, drug and weapons possession and returned to the United States. The interior secretary of southern Morelos state, Jorge Messeguer, said Edgar Jimenez Lugo had been released today - though he added it wasn’t clear if the teen had been rehabilitated. 'Being able to say whether he’s been rehabilitated, that would be risky. I wouldn’t really dare say that, because obviously the crimes he committed were so severe,' Messeguer said. Freed: Edgar Jimenez Lugo, pictured in 2010 aged 14, has now been freed from a Mexican juvenile offender institution after serving three years for the brutal murders of four boys . Lugo pictured following his arrest with a Mexican soldier. The teenager is now on his way to the U.S. to live with family . He said Jimenez flew to San Antonio, Texas on Tuesday where he does not face any charges under U.S. law and is considered a free man. The U.S. Embassy said it would not publicly discuss the case due to privacy considerations. The teenager is believed to have family in Texas and apparently will go to a residential support facility there. The embassy said in a statement that it was 'closely coordinating with our Mexican counterparts and appropriate authorities in the United States' regarding the release. In 2011, at age 14, Jimenez confessed to killing four young men whose beheaded bodies were found suspended from a bridge. He was born in San Diego, California, but was raised in Mexico by his grandmother. Authorities quoted Jimenez as saying he had been forcibly recruited by drug traffickers when he was 11 and confessing to working for the South Pacific drug cartel, led by reputed drug lord Hector Beltran Leyva. Jimenez was trying to return to the United States when he was caught in 2010. Beheading: A video allegedly shows The Ponchis and his associates preparing to cut the neck of a victim . He and a sister were arrested in . Morelos, south of Mexico City, as they tried to board a plane to . Tijuana, where they planned to cross the border and reunite with their . mother in San Diego. When . he was handed over to federal prosecutors, the boy calmly said in front . of cameras that he participated in four killings while drugged and . under threat. The bodies were found in the tourist city of Cuernavaca, . which is in Morelos. Jimenez served his three-year sentence, the maximum for juveniles, at a juvenile detention center in Morelos. The . states was formerly controlled by the Beltran Leyva gang, which broke . up after alleged leader Arturo Beltran Leyva died in a shootout with . Mexican marines in 2009. Edgar was 14 in August 2010 when he . killed the young men — a student, a cook at a university, a gas station . attendant and a small-business owner. Lugo, nicknamed 'El Ponchis,' received a . three-year term, which was the maximum allowed under law, after he . admitted to beheading the four victims in central Mexico. Violent: The military stopped a group of young people in the town of Jiutepec aged between 12 and 23 who were linked to the South Pacific Cartel . Siblings: Mexican soldiers guard Elizabeth (L) and Oliva Jimenez Lugo (R), aka 'Las Chavelas', sisters of Edgar Jimenez Lugo . At . the time of his arrest, he told reporters: 'I participated in four executions, but I . did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't, they would kill me.' Lugo became notorious due to his age and . online videos that discussed him. There was also a YouTube video of him . beating a man with a two-by-four while the man was hanging from the . ceiling. Edgar was convicted in juvenile court in July 2011 of homicide and organized crime charges, and sentenced to three years in custody, the maximum allowed. Once freed, Edgar will face no clear legal obstacles to crossing into the United States. 'He can come live here when he turns 18 . (in May) without any supervision. The U.S. can't do anything, and Mexico . cannot do anything,' she said. 'He wasn't charged with conspiracy in . the U.S.' said Guadalupe Valencia, a San Diego criminal defense attorney. Lugo was arrested at a Mexican airport . when he and a sister were trying to flee authorities and fly to their . mother in San Diego, the outlet reported. Yolanda Lugo Jimenez was . then arrested a few days later on immigration violations and deported in . April, the outlet reported noting her whereabouts are now unclear. Because of his criminal background, his family in Mexico fears his return could also put them at risk. In recent weeks, his case and pending release has received intense media attention locally. A book bearing Edgar’s image on the cover was released last month. It included his former street address.

"A French adventurer who trekked across Canada has vanished in the Alaskan wilderness - leaving behind his kayak, food, several maps and a personal journal. Francois Guenot, 32, dubbed 'the crazy Frenchman', went missing as he explored the wild land of the four-million-acre Katmai National Park last month. His red-and-white kayak was discovered on a beach along Shelikof Strait off Cape Douglas, around 200 miles south-west of Anchorage, last week. Mystery: Francois Guenot was last seen in Kohanok on the Alaska Peninsula and planned to kayak hundreds of miles to Perryville. Remains found on Shuhak Island in September have been identified as his body . It contained his identification, food and maps, as well as an array of personal journals, according to rangers at the park, which is home to Alaskan brown bears. 'We've picked up nothing more,' chief park ranger Neal Labrie told the Associated Press yesterday. 'And the last journal entry he had among his goods was dated June 15. 'There is really no reason why he would . have left all his personal belongings, especially his ID behind.' Mr Guenot, who worked as a ski instructor in Maiche France, arrived in Lake Iliamna in south-west Alaska last autumn after spending more than two years trekking across Canada. Wilderness: The 32-year-old's red-and-white kayak, containing his possessions, was discovered on a beach along Shelikof Strait off Cape Douglas (pictured), around 200 miles south-west of Anchorage, in June . He is believed to have made his way to Kokhanok - a small community on the south shore of Iliamna Lake - before leaving on May 6 with the intention of travelling to Perryville, according to the Anchorage Daily News. He was last seen on May 26 squatting in a cabin at Amakdedori Creek, around 40 miles west of Kamishak Bay, . Mr Labrie said a search for Mr Guenot - carried out by park rangers, the U.S. Coastguard and eventually Alaska State Troopers - had been suspended on Saturday following the discovery of his possessions, with aerial searches also failing to locate his whereabouts. 'Had there been anybody or anything to see along those coastal areas, we probably would have seen them,' Mr Labrie said. He added that if Mr Guenot had decided to abandon his kayak and walk, the search area could be 'endless', since his possible route was not known. Park ranger Wendy Artz said the adventurer could be anywhere between Kokhanak and Chignik, a small fishing community around 250 miles to the south-west. She added that the land between the two villages in home to more bears than people, while the waters of Cape Douglas - where Mr Guenot's possessions were found - are notoriously dangerous . Mr Guenot arrived in Canada in the summer of 2011 to begin his trek across North America, which included several misadventures, including falling into a river in the winter. He eventually made his way to Fairbanks, where he found a bike at the dump and rode it to Homer, before venturing to Seldovia, where he found two kayaks and made them into one seaworthy vessel. In . January . 2012, he told Yukon News that he dreamed of adventure in the wilds of Canada and Alaska, . saying: 'I don't want to stay like a dog on a leash in France.' Treacherous: The adventurer is believed to have been making his way from Kokhanok to Perryville. Katmai National Park ranger Wendy Artz said the land between the two villages in home to more bears than people . After showing up in south-west Alaska, Mr Guenot befriended Kokhanok resident Gary Nielsen and lived on his property in a tent. When it was too cold to sleep outside, Mr Nielsen said the explorer - who earned his nickname based on his ultimate goal to reach the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia - would sleep in a steam bath. He added that Mr Guenot had set off in May, telling him that he was going to Perryville, but had seemed to have trouble comprehending the great distances involved in travelling Alaska. Earlier this year, the adventurer had spent three weeks walking around Lake Iliamna during spring break up, but somehow came back in one piece, he said. Meanwhile, another of Mr Guenot's friends, Jim Tilley of Intricate Bay, said many locals were concerned about him, telling the Daily News: 'He was just aloof to the dangers of Alaska.' Mr Neilsen said Mr Guenot had been planning to meet up with friends on July 19 when he vanished. 'If we hear nothing by the end of July, he's probably dead,' he added.","Francois Guenot, 32, vanished as he explored Alaskan wilderness in May .

"A man has lost an eye after he was shot with a catapult at the site where King Harold lost the Battle of Hastings, a court heard. Isaac Fuller, 25, was visiting the famous landmark when he was hit in the left eye with a projectile fired by Eli King and Anthony Adams, both 23. Mr Fuller, lost sight in his eye following the incident, which took place in the same location King Harold died after being shot with an arrow in the eye in battle against William the Conqueror in 1066. Eli King (left) shot Isaac Fuller in the eye with a catapult on the Battle of Hastings site. The incident mirrors that of the 1066 battle in which King Harold died after being shot with an arrow in the eye (right) The attack took place in May in the town of Battle, East Sussex, the site of the famous Battle of Hastings. Mr Fuller said the pair shot at him because King was jealous of the victim's relationship with his ex-girlfriend. He fired at him near the exact spot where it is believed King Harold lost his eye. King, from Battle, denied grievous bodily harm with intent but was jailed for 12 years after being found guilty by a jury at Brighton Crown Court. The incident took place on the same site where King Harold (seen here on the Bayeux tapestry) was shot in the eye . Adams, also from Battle, admitted the same offence and was jailed for eight years. Mr Fuller lost two teeth and his left eye during the sustained attack. He told the court: ‘I got shot in Battle. I got shot in the back of the head, shot in the mouth and lost two teeth. Janice Brennan, prosecuting, said: ‘He was battered and bruised, had lost his teeth and had completely lost his left eye. ‘He was attacked by two men. One was Anthony Adams. Mr Adams has pleaded guilty. The other was Mr King.’ He told the court how, during the attack, he turned around to see Adams, wielding a catapult, who then shot him in the mouth. Mr Fuller ran away, where he was pelted with more projectiles by the pair, before stopping in an alleyway. He said: ‘I stumbled and turned to face them. I looked up. I was looking straight at them when I got shot again. ‘I was shot in my left eye. It just came out. I fell down. Eli King shot me in the eye.’ After the sentencing, Sussex Police said: ‘King and Adams fired ball bearings pellet from catapults at the victim and one of the ball bearing hit him in the eye blinding him. He ended up losing his eye.’ Detective Sergeant Paul Graham added: ‘The sentences Adams and King received reflect the seriousness of the assault. ‘The victim suffered a sustained attack which resulted in life changing injuries. The long jail sentences send out a message that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated.’ This scene, from the Bayeux tapestry, shows the moment King Harold was shot in the eye in 1066 .

"A suicidal college student who claimed she was attacked and raped was charged with staging the incident by posting ads on Craigslist, calling for men to beat her up in exchange for sex. Morgan Triplett, 20, was charged with falsifying a police report after she told campus police at the University of California-Santa Cruz that she was on the grounds of the school looking for banana slugs in the forest when a stranger attacked and sexually assaulted her. Now she is being criminally charged for lying about the circumstances of her attack, after police spent nearly two weeks investigating only to find out that she arranged for a man to beat her in exchange for sex. Troubled: Morgan Triplett, 20, arranged to have a man meet her off Craigslist and beat her up in exchange for sex. Afterwards, she filed a false rape report to campus police . Facing punishment: Triplett said that a stranger attacked and assaulted her while she was looking for banana slugs- which are the UC-Santa Cruz mascot- in the redwood forest right near campus, which was a lie . Triplett, a UC-Santa Barbara student who was visiting UC-Santa Cruz for a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender conference at the time of the incident on February 17, had bruises on her head and torso when she reported the alleged rape to campus police. Motive: Triplett is now facing up to six months in jail and investigators say she did it because she was 'suicidal' The claims were given even more credence by the fact that there had been another attack near the campus just days earlier when a UC-Santa Cruz student was robbed and shot in the head while waiting for a bus. According to the local Patch, Triplett posted two ads to Craigslist on February 15, the day prior to attending the UCSC conference. The first ad called for someone to shoot her in the shoulder with a small caliber gun. The second wanted someone to punch, kick and bruise her. Both situations would be done in exchange for sex, and she wrote 'no charges would be filed' against anyone who responded. 'The second ad, which ultimately was . the one responded to, was seeking someone with a strong hand to inflict . punches, bruises and kicks and compensation was to be provided with . sex,' Ms Schonfeld said outside court. 'Several people responded to the ad.' An unidentified man who responded to . the second ad- and agreed to beat her in exchange for sex. She then . called campus police and told them the story about wandering through the . redwood forest near UC-Santa Cruz, looking for the banana slugs that . serve as the school mascot. 'After an extensive investigation it . became apparent that the majority of the information that Ms. Triplett . gave the officers was not in fact true,' assistant district attorney . Johanna Schonfield told local station KSBW. Protection: Morgan Triplett was covered by her father when she left court in Santa Cruz on Friday after filing a not guilty plea for falsifying a police report . 'They had sex and afterwards she used a . cellphone screen reflection as a mirror to see if the injuries were bad . enough. (Triplett) then directed him to hit her some more.' At court on Friday, where Triplett . entered a not guilty plea on the charge of falsifying a police report, . Ms Schonfield said that the 20-year-old is depressed and seeking medical . treatment for mental issues. 'She was suicidal and she wanted something to bring her back to reality,' Ms Schonfield said. Triplett appeared at court on Friday alongside her father who tried to block cameras from taking her picture. 'Right now I just want this to settle down. I’m trying to move on with my life,' she said. If . found guilty, she may face up to six months in jail for falsifying a . police report, as well as paying restitution for the dozens of manhours . that police had to use in the ten days following her rape report before . realizing it was a lie. Scene: The incident occurred when Triplett- a student at UC-Santa Barbara- was attending a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender conference at UC-Santa Cruz (pictured) Her father said that the case is being mis-characterized, and though he did not elaborate on the details, he said that there are 'two sides to every story.' 'Morgan asked for some trouble, but she did not ask to be sexually assaulted,' Richard Triplett told the local newspaper, The Register Pajaronian. 'What we're dealing with is a very scared, very upset, very confused 20-year-old girl who has made some poor choices. This is the culmination of those choices.'","Morgan Triplett, 20, arranged to have a man meet her off Craigslist and beat her so that she looked bruised, and then she repaid him with sex .

Sales technique: Mr Smith says he has 'always looked for value for money', and believes that selling property online is 'the future' 'It is the future of property selling so no wonder the high street estate agents hate us.' Mr Smith realised he had the entrepreneurial spirit from an early age. He recalls sitting on his father's market stall aged two, and opened his first discount store aged 16, selling items with damaged packaging for 10p a pop. He set up Poundland with a single shop in Burton upon Trent in 1990, and the business has gone on from strength to strength ever since. It now has 500 stores in the UK – more than double the number it had five years ago – selling everything from toys to toiletries, stationery to shampoo and bread to biscuits – all for the same price. Mr Smith sold his share in the business in 2002, making himself a £50million fortune. Design: The property was originally designed by Sir Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis, who famously created the Italianate village of Portmeirion in North Wales, but Mr Smith has put his own spin on it . Labour of love: Mr Smith said he spared no expense on refurbishing his home, and it 'will be a real wrench' for the family to leave . It helped him buy Hammer Hill House, a sprawling mansion near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, 14 years ago. The property was originally designed by Sir Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis, who famously created the Italianate village of Portmeirion in North Wales. But after Mr Smith moved in, he soon started to put his own spin on it. Now the mansion boasts its own indoor swimming pool and snooker room, all set in almost 30 acres of rolling countryside. Mr Smith said: 'The house is very special to us and it will be a real wrench for us to leave,' he said. 'We began refurbishing the home in 2000 and finally finished it in 2007. It was a real labour of love and no expense was spared. I especially love our home pub with a fully stocked bar. It's really unique and we've had some great parties there.' Entrepreneur: Mr Smith set up Poundland with a single shop in Burton upon Trent in 1990, and sold his share in the business in 2002. Pictured is the branch in Scunthorpe . Mr Smith's story is being filmed by the BBC for a new series of Poundshop wars to be shown early next year. 'I'm really hooked on selling pound products even though I sold Poundland many years ago,' Mr Smith, who has now taken the business online with Poundshop.com, said. 'Buying online is great for time pressed people and we are expanding our ranges daily. 'We soon hope to be selling everything from sexy lingerie to dog food at knockdown prices.

"A European court ruling could undermine legal powers used to track down terrorists, paedophiles and serious criminals, it was feared last night. European judges ruled that a powerful law used to force internet companies to store data about their users’ online activities - so it can be accessed if needed during a police investigation - was excessively intrusive. Last night the implications of the judgment were being rapidly assessed by the Home Office, police and security agencies amid fears it could drastically undermine their ability to investigate crimes. Threat: The ruling, which deemed powers used by internet companies were too intrusive, could undermine police investigations into serious criminals, terrorists and paedophiles (file picture) One Whitehall source said the ruling was ‘potentially very significant’. The ruling concerns a European Union directive around the storing of personal data by internet companies which came into force in 2006. The law allows governments and law enforcement agencies to require internet and phone companies to store information about users’ web activities, email and phone use for up to two years. They are paid to do so by police and the Government so that information can be used if needed for criminal investigations. But the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg found that the rules ‘interfere in a serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for private life’. Fears: The law allows governments and law enforcement agencies to require internet and phone companies to store information about users' web activities, email and phone use for up to two years . The storing and potential use of the data - without the person’s knowledge - is likely to lead to people feeling that their ‘private lives are the subject of constant surveillance’ the court said. Senior police officers said the use of such data was ‘essential in combating serious and organised crime, protecting the public and ensuring national security.’ Initial readings of the ruling appeared to suggest that it completely ruled out any data collection by technology firms. However, a spokesman for ISPA, the trade association for internet providers said its members would continue to collect the information. Nicholas Lansman, ISPA Secretary General said: ‘The CJEU ruling has the potential for major changes to the data retention regime, however we believe that for the time being that obligations remain in place. ‘It is crucial that the European Commission and Home Office provide guidance and clarity to industry.’ Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee her department would ‘look very carefully at the full implications of the judgment’. Mrs May said communications data had been used in ‘every major case in the last decade’ and was used to identify people who would ‘cause us serious harm’. Civil liberties campaigners welcomed the ruling. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This deeply authoritarian Directive was the product of an unholy alliance between Tony Blair’s government and Brussels bureaucrats, using EU law as the fig-leaf to sanction indiscriminate monitoring of data on innocent citizens from Blackpool to Barcelona. Intrusion: The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg found that the rules 'interfere in a serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for private life' ‘We need to arrest this erosion of personal our privacy, and make sure intrusive surveillance is focused on fighting terrorism and serious crime.” But Assistant Chief Constable Richard Berry, national police spokesman on electronic data, said the information was a ‘useful tool’ in combatting organised criminals. ‘We remain convinced that there is a significant role for communications interception and the acquisition of data communications in keeping the public safe, and our commitment to balancing that with our legal and human rights duties remains equally strong.’ One MEP said the ruling meant urgent new powers were needed. Timothy Kirkhope, home affairs spokesman for the European Conservatives and Reformists group said the ruling should not be allowed to hamper law enforcement. He said: ‘This ruling is frustrating but there are understandable privacy concerns about indiscriminate collection and retention of people’s data. ‘Criminals and terrorists are growing increasingly sophisticated, so law enforcement must have the tools necessary to keep up with them. ‘That’s why we need a directive that balances both privacy concerns with the need to tackle a constant threat.’","Judgement could undermine powers to track down criminals .

"We live in an age of oversharing where people offer up all sorts of information online from what they're having for dinner to the toilet habits of their children. But could your Facebook status be giving more away about yourself than you realise? Researchers from Penn University studied the statuses of 75,000 people and were able to predict their age, gender and even personality type based just on the words they used. They also discovered that the sexes live up to stereotypes - with women posting regularly about their hair, boyfriends, chocolate, and babies, while for men it was all about computer games, beards,  swearing and sport. This cloud shows the most commonly used words by females on Facebook. Women were more likely to use adjectives, such as 'yummy' and 'wonderful', as well as more emoticons than men. They also regularly talked about their family and friends, clothes and hair . The . most commonly used words by women including 'shopping', 'excited', . 'love you' and the '<3' emoticon, which is used a heart. Men . commonly used the word 'f**k', 'f****g', 'wishes he', 'xbox' and . 'himself' and we more likely to link to content. Teenagers used emoticons, variations of the word 'haha' and discussed school, homework and teachers more than older people. They were also more likely to use abbreviations such as 'omfg' and 'gah'.

The . tool is being rolled out to the web version of the social network site, . but is expected to also be made available on Android and iOS apps in . the near future. Neurotics were more likely to use words such as 'scared', 'depressed' 'crap' and 'lonely', while people with less neuroticism used words including 'praise', 'blessed' 'beautiful', 'success' and spoke less about sports. 'This doesn't guarantee that doing . sports will make you less neurotic; it could be that neuroticism causes . people to avoid sports,' said co-author professor Lyle Ungar of Computer and Information Science. 'But it does suggest that we should . explore the possibility that neurotic individuals would become more . emotionally stable if they played more sports.' Open people spoke more about dreams, art, writing and the universe, whereas people who were less open on the personality questionnaire used more abbreviations and were poor spellers. The group from the University of Pennsylvania were interested in whether analysis of the language used on Facebook could provide as much, or more, insight into someone's personality compared to traditional methods used by psychologists, such as self-reported surveys and questionnaires. A word cloud that shows language used mostly by extroverts prominently featured words and phrases including 'party,' 'great night' and 'hit me up', pictured . They asked 75,000 people to complete a common personality questionnaire through a Facebook app. The participants also made their Facebook status updates public for a limited time. From a database of more than 700 . million words, phrases and topics, the researchers looked for overall linguistic patterns used by the volunteers. They thencreated a computer algorithm that could predict the person's age and gender, as well their responses on the personality questionnaires. The . researchers were correct 92 per cent of the time when predicting users' gender based only on the language of their status updates, and they could identify a person's age within three years in more than 50 per cent of cases. The personality predictions were 'inherently less accurate' but author H. Andrew Schwartz, a postdoctoral fellow in computer and information science and the Positive Psychology Center, claimed that they were 'nearly as good as using a person's questionnaire results from . one day to predict their answers to the same questionnaire on another . day.' A word cloud for introverts featured many references to Japanese media, such as Pokeman and anime, 'google', 'sigh' and more emoticons than extroverts . 'Most . words occur rarely - any sample of writing, including Facebook status . updates, only contains a small portion of the average vocabulary,' Schwartz said. 'This means that, for all but the most common words, you . need writing samples from many people in order to make connections with . psychological traits. 'Traditional studies have found interesting . connections with pre-chosen categories of words such as 'positive . emotion' or 'function words.' However, the billions of word instances . available in social media allow us to find patterns at a much richer . level.' The study is part of the World Well-Being Project with members of the Computer and Information Science Department in Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Department of Psychology and its Positive Psychology Center in the School of Arts and Sciences. It was published in the PLOS One Journal.","Researchers were correct 92 per cent of the time when predicting gender .

"The family of a six-year-old girl with cerebral palsy have condemned 'cruel' NHS bosses after an operation to help her walk was cancelled at the last moment - because of budget cuts. Shannon Bowley can only shuffle around on her bottom or take a few slow steps with the aid of a walking frame. She was due to have a life-changing operation this Friday which would have loosened her muscles to help her walk independently. Disappointment: Shannon Bowley has cerebral palsy and can only shuffle around on her bottom or take a few slow steps with the aid of a walking frame. An operation which would have loosened her muscles to help her walk has now been cancelled . But just six days before surgery, her family were dealt a devastating blow when they received a letter informing them that NHS England had cancelled funding for the operation. Shannon’s grandmother and full-time carer Samantha Jones, 42, said her grand-daughter had also been through a year of painful procedures in preparation for the surgery. She said: 'I felt like I had been punched in the stomach when I opened the letter - I was crying and I was heartbroken. I couldn’t think straight and I was just trying to phone the hospital. 'After signing the consent form I thought it was a done deal. I felt like the whole world had fallen through. Everything we had done was pointless.' Shannon’s family are certain the . operation would have had a huge impact on her life and have lambasted . NHS bosses for cancelling funding. Mrs . Jones said: 'It would change our lives immensely - it will give her the . ability to play with other children, to run in the playground and just . to have a better quality of life forever. Dashed hopes: Shannon's life-changing surgery has been cancelled with just days to go due to NHS 'budget cuts', her family have been told . 'She would be able to lead an independent life. 'I . can’t believe that they will allow surgery for people who have done . things to themselves, but not to a child that was born trapped in a . disabled body - I can’t fathom it. 'If . it cannot go ahead, I would take her to any hospital - I would travel . to the ends of the Earth - one way or another she will have it even if . it kills me.' She added: 'We now have to raise £7,000 to have the operation done privately but it could be even more if we have to fly to America. 'We are determined to raise the money, we’ll do anything. It feels like hospital have raised our hopes only for them to be cruelly dashed days before the surgery. 'I am willing to do absolutely anything - I would live on toast and beans forever and I have lined up a loan with my bank.' Upset: Shannon with her mother Amy (left) and grandmother Samantha Jones, who said: 'I am willing to do absolutely anything for her to get the operation - I would live on beans on toast and have lined up a loan with my bank in case we have to pay for it ourselves' The procedure - called selective dorsal rhizotomy - can improve mobility and can give a new lease of life to young sufferers. Doctors . cut through nerve connections in the spinal cord - decreasing the . messages sent from the brain which relaxes the muscles. Shannon, also lives with her mother Amy, 27, and her three-year-old brother Oliver in Aspley, Nottingham. She weighed just over 4lbs when she was born and just 17lbs when she was two-and-a-half-years-old because the cerebral palsy slowed her development. She went through years of painful surgery including a brain scan and having a catheter inserted in her spine. Mrs Jones added: 'Every aspect of her life I have to do for her. She can only walk with me holding her under her arms or with a special frame. Hope: The procedure Shannon was due to have is called selective dorsal rhizotomy. This can improve mobility and can give a new lease of life to young sufferers . 'The hope was the surgery meant she could walk - many children are walking within 12 months unaided - we were hoping we can put in some intense physiotherapy after surgery which we would fund ourselves and get her walking. 'We had taken her out of school for a week so she did not come into contact with infection, she’s on antibiotics and she’s already had her bed moved downstairs so we’ve got a ready-made ward for her. 'She’s amazing. She’s bright, clever and is a real little character. She’s a very brave girl, she’s had a lot to put up with and she’s had a lot of surgery. She’s so kind.' Shannon is one of eight children with cerebral palsy who have had operations cancelled just weeks or months in advance at Nottingham hospitals. NHS England said money for the surgery was discontinued last April but Shannon’s family have written to the hospital and are planning to appeal the decision. Unfair: Shannon is one of eight children with cerebral palsy who have had operations cancelled just weeks or months in advance at Nottingham hospitals . A petition against the cancellation has attracted more than 400 signatures in just 24 hours. An NHS England spokeswoman said: “We are now working with Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust to understand why this has taken place and regret any distress which may have been caused to the families affected.' Health bosses from NHS England say the procedure was removed from a list of publicly-funded operations in April 2013 after a consultation. The treatment was not considered to offer “value for money or clinical effectiveness” compared to other procedures. Dr Stephen Fowlie, medical director at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We apologise for the disappointment and distress caused by the cancellation of surgery at such short notice. The hospital has apologised for 'the disappointment and distress caused by the cancellation of surgery at such short notice' 'We had been hopeful that we would reach agreement to continue a funded programme. 'We have, to date, been unable to secure NHS funding and we have therefore, regrettably, had to stop our programme. 'We continue to explore options which would enable those patients who had received dates for their surgery to have their operation at our hospital. 'This includes the possibility of parents self-funding the operation. We believe that this decision by NHS England has prompted a number of families across the country to explore self-funding this treatment. 'We will be discussing with parents alternative treatments that are funded by the NHS.'","Shannon Bowley can only move around on her bottom or with a frame .

"One California lawyer counts Jamie Foxx, President Obama and Kim Kardashian among her more than 50 celebrity friends - but the bar association says that's just not true. Los Angeles attorney Svitlana Sangary stands accused of photoshopping herself into dozens of photos with the rich and famous, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Donald Trump. Now the California Supreme Court is being asked to suspend Sangary's law license for six months and put her on probation for three years for using 'deceptive advertising.' Scroll down for video . 'Deceptive advertising': Los Angeles attorney Svitlana Sangary (left) stands accused of photoshopping herself into pictures with more than 50 celebrities, and posting the images on her law practice website. One of the pictures above, with George Clooney (Right) 'Friends' in high places: The images were still up on Sangary's website as of Thursday evening. Pictured above with actress Anne Hathaway . Punishment: The California bar association is recommending that Sangary's law license be suspended for six months, and that she be put on probation for three years. Pictured above with Donald Trump . Business: According to her website, Sangary practices deals in business, real estate, foreclosure, insurance, employment and personal injury litigation . State Bar Court Judge Donald F Miles says the photos posted on Sangary's law practice website 'were created by taking original celebrity photos and then overlaying (Sangary’s) image in order to make it appear as though (Sangary) was in the presence of that celebrity'. In some of the photos, Sangary even uses the same picture of herself. When confronted about the pictures two years ago, Sangary didn't even trouble herself to take the photos down from the site. They still appeared there Thursday, under a tab titled 'publicity'. In fact, Miles says Sangary responded to the charges in a '16-page soliloquy with little to no rational connection to the charges at hand'. In one particularly strange excerpt, Sangary goes on a tangent about Natalie Portman's performance in the 2010 ballet-drama 'Black Swan' The passage reads: 'Also, with regard to false statements and misleading advertisement, none other than Natalie Portman comes to mind. The online media extensively covers the controversy surrounding Natalie Portman’s performance in the film Black Swan. The ballet dancer who performed in the Black Swan, Sarah Lane, has come forward to revel [sic] a ‘cover-up’ and says that Natalie Portman’s head was superimposed on to Sarah Lane’s body, and that Natalie Portman lied.' She also includes an email from President Obama in the response, in which he allegedly asks her to donate to the Democratic party. The court is recommending that Sangary's law license be suspended for six months, and she be put on probation for three years. That decision ultimately lies with the California Supreme Court, and Sangary has 30 days to respond.

"Rare photographs of the Beatles crossing Abbey Road shot for the cover of the last album they recorded together have sold for a staggering £180,000. The six stills were rejected as possible covers of the Beatles' famed Abbey Road album released in September 1969, just months before they split up. They were taken by Scots photographer Iain Macmillan, a close friend of John Lennon, who balanced precariously on a ladder in the middle of the road in north London for the shoot. Scroll down for video . Familiar, yet unfamiliar:Rare photographs of the Beatles crossing Abbey Road shot for the cover of the last album they recorded together have sold for a whopping £180,000 . They were taken by Scots photographer Iain Macmillan, a close friend of John Lennon, who balanced precariously on a ladder in the middle of the road in north London for the shoot . He had just 10 minutes to get his shot so he got the Fab Four to walk back and forth continuously over the now famous zebra crossing . He had just 10 minutes to get his shot so he got the Fab Four to walk back and forth continuously over the now famous zebra crossing. As a consequence three of the unused shots feature the Beatles walking 'the wrong way' over the crossing in the opposite direction to the iconic image that was chosen as the album cover. In the fifth shot in the sequence each member of the band appears to be walking at the same time, and the road behind them is clear. Paul McCartney picked the shot to be used as the album cover - the rest were discarded. Also sold was the photo that became the back cover of the album - a road sign with a blurred person in the foreground. Three of the unused shots feature the Beatles walking 'the wrong way' over the crossing in the opposite direction to the iconic image that was chosen as the album cover . Sarah Wheeler, head of photography at Bloomsbury Auctions with one of the framed out takes from the famous Abbey Road photoshoot . Macmillan was just about to take his shot when a girl in a blue dress walked into the frame, but the band liked it and chose it for the back cover. Experts predicted the photos would make £70,000 when they went under the hammer at Bloomsbury Auctions. It will be the first time they have ever been sold as a complete set. Sarah Wheeler, Head of Photography at Bloomsbury Auctions said: 'Iain Macmillan was hired by the Beatles in 1969 to shoot the album art for Abbey Road but he only had 10 minutes to do it in. 'He was stood on a ladder leaning against a tree and for 10 minutes he got John, Paul, George and Ringo to walk back and forth across the zebra crossing on Abbey Road. 'He took shots of them going both ways across the crossing until he finally got the frame he was after. 'In the photo we all know the Beatles are all very symmetrical and there is no traffic in the background but in the outtakes there are taxis and buses on the road.' Recognisable: Paul McCartney picked the shot to be used the album cover - the rest were discarded . Abbey Road was the penultimate album released by the Beatles, however Let It Be, their final album, had largely been recorded before the material on Abbey Road . She added: 'It is amazing to see the making of what is one of the most iconic pop photographs ever taken. 'More than 50 years on people are still going to Abbey Road to recreate Iain Macmillan's photo. 'The outtakes are incredibly rare individually but this is the first time they have ever been sold as a set.' Abbey Road was the penultimate album released by the Beatles, however Let It Be, their final album, had largely been recorded before the material on Abbey Road. The outtake photographs were passed to Iain Macmillan's family following his death in 2006. They were sold individually but have since been reunited by a private collector who is now selling the set. Two weeks ago a woman was sent flying through the air after she was struck by a car at the Abbey Road crossing. Video footage captured on a webcam installed outside the historic studios, shows the unnamed female running across the famous street.

"He wanted to create an Aryan race of so-called superior beings, but Hitler and his Nazis didn’t stop at humans. They were also trying to re-instate prehistoric animals that had been extinct for 9,000 years. They planned to bring back wild Auroch cows - which stood at 7ft to the shoulder and had giant horns - to hunt in ancient forests across Europe, new research has uncovered. Hitler and his Nazis wanted to bring back the prehistoric auroch cow, a new documentary will reveal next week. Pictured is a portrait of a Nazi posing with the skeleton of the creature . The documentary, called Hitler's Jurassic Monsters featuring Dr Jacqui Melville- a Bio Archaeologist, will divulge the efforts his men went to to try and reinstate the creature into Europe's forests . And next week a new documentary will . reveal the previously unknown lengths key Nazi figures went to in . developing their prehistoric flock during the Second World War, using a . process known as back breeding. It was all part of the Nazi obsession with creating a connection to the primeval Germanic tribes of history, which they believed would give them added credibility with the German people. And it was overseen by Herman Goring – Hitler’s second in command and chief huntsman of the Third Reich – who sought a larger and more challenging beast to hunt. Goring studied ancient documents and cave paintings about Aurochs, which once roamed across Europe in earlier times. And he planned to breed the animals in zoos before reinstating them in the primeval Białowieża forest in Poland, which was rapidly cleared of its Jewish inhabitants. The project was overseen by Goering, pictured with the carcass of a deer, who wanted to create the beasts to provide him with a more challenging animal to hunt . Goering poses with a line of dead deer - with other Nazis behind him.  Goring studied ancient documents and cave paintings about Aurochs, which once roamed across Europe in earlier times. Yesterday Dr Toby Thacker, senior lecturer in modern European history Cardiff University, said: ‘This is one part of a larger story about how the Nazi party sought to give itself a longer history and a credibility and a sense of legitimacy with the German people by saying they weren’t something totally new but had this 2,000 year history going back to the Germanic tribes in the forest. 'So the creation of these animals is just one part of that effort to give themselves some history. ‘For Goring, hunting was one of the greatest human activities and he believed there would be a special quality to these particularly wild and ferocious animals. 'He imagined repopulating large areas of Eastern Europe with these animals. 'They were bigger and more atrocious and more vicious and that was one of the attractions, because Goring knew hunting those animals would be much more of a challenge than hunting say a fox or a hare. It was the ultimate hunting challenge.’ Dr Toby Thacker, a History lecturer at Cardiff University, will also appear in the show - which will air next week. Experts will say how the plan to bring back the cows was part on an obsession to create a connection to the primeval Germanic tribes of history . As with many Nazi policies, the level of secrecy Hitler ruled in has made it difficult for historians to make discoveries. Orders were given verbally and rarely written down and evidence of killings was covered up – by burning bodies and destroying concentration camps. But by examining fossilised bones of Aurochs and a war diary kept by a Nazi unit, researchers have been able to identify the Nazis’ plans. Heck cattle pictured in Neadrathal Germany - which look similar to the auroch cows, which would roam across Europe in the prehistoric period . And they appear to chime with the party’s ideology about creating racial purity, which saw the execution of 3,300,000 Jews during the Holocaust. Dr Thacker said: ‘When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union and captured Białowieża forest they immediately set it aside and gave it to Goring who said let’s reinstate these animals there. 'And he said we need to get rid of all the inhabitants, particularly the Jews. So there’s this connection between the reintroduction of the animals and the extermination of the Jews. 'And that’s what adds a terrible twist to this story.’ Next week, Hitler’s Jurassic Monsters will use a combination of old footage and photographs and reconstructed drama to tell of the seizure of the primeval Białowieża forest in July 1941 and the Nazis’ mission to reinstate prehistoric Aurochs. The documentary airs on Tuesday (June 17) on the National Geographic Channel at 8pm.","Hitler wanted to bring back animals that had been extinct for 9,000 years .

"Two men seriously injured in a gas explosion yesterday have been arrested by detectives who believe the blast may have come from a 'Breaking Bad' style drugs lab. The men, one aged 27 and the other in his 30s, were said to be in a 'serious' condition in hospital last night after being burnt when the blast ripped off the side of the house in Birmingham. Both have been arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and West Midlands Police say the blast 'may have been linked to the production of illegal drugs'. And this morning, one neighbour claimed the house is a well-known drugs den and was being used to 'cook' crystal methamphetamine - a highly addictive drug that is the focus of hit American TV show Breaking Bad. Scroll down for video . Arrests: Police have arrested the men on suspicion of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and West Midlands Police say the blast 'may have been linked to the production of illegal drugs' Frightening: Residents reported hearing a noise 'like a bomb going off', before the front of the property was 'totally obliterated' A plastic bag full of aerosol canisters was found among the debris inside the wrecked house this morning as police cordoned off the area . The neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Its well known in the area but nobody has been brave enough to report it to police. 'We've smelt cannabis coming from there before but I've been told they've expanded, shall we say. 'They were producing crystal meth because of the bigger profits and there's more of a demand for it these days. Another resident, who also declined to be named, added: 'I was told they had started cooking crank (crystal methamphetamine) but I didn't believe it. 'But it looks like they should have stuck to what they knew best, they must have been amateurs.' The explosion happened just after 8pm - leaving the property in the West Heath area of the city in ruins. Crumbling wreck: The gas explosion has left parts of the building scattered across the surrounding gardens up to 40ft away . Devastation: The front of the house has been ripped open leaving fragments of building and household appliances littered around the premises . Residents reported hearing a noise 'like a bomb going off', before the front of the house was 'totally obliterated'. Both men were inside the property at the time of the explosion and were taken to the city's Queen Elizabeth Hospital with burns to their arms, head and back. A force spokesman said the arrested men were still in hospital this morning but their injuries are not described as life-threatening. Detectives are to question the pair when they have recovered. Meanwhile, the road remains closed while an investigation continues and the site of the explosion is made safe. Chief Inspector Sean Russell, of West Midlands Police, moved to reassure the local community, saying it was 'an isolated explosion'. Turning to the possible cause, he said: 'One line of inquiry is that it may have been linked to the production of illegal drugs.' Parts of the building could be seen scattered across gardens up to 40ft away this morning, while neighbouring homes were said to have shook under the force of the blast. Paramedics said a third man, who was in a neighbouring property at the time, was treated at the scene but did not require hospital treatment. Tony Rice, 50, who lives opposite the damaged property, said: 'I just heard this massive boom and I went outside and a front door frame had smashed my van window. 'I live over 40 metres away from the property so that shows the force of the explosion. The front of the property is wide open, it has ripped the walls clean off. Tremor: One shocked neighbour claimed the gas explosion shook her own house to its core while she watching the X-Factor . Another neighbour said: 'It was a noise like I had never heard. I can't describe it. It was terrifying' - above, a neighbour's garden with scattered debris from the explosion . 'I think one of the blokes lived upstairs and the other downstairs. The man from downstairs had his skin ripped off. He was in a bad way. 'The upstairs tenant was walking around but was obviously in a lot of shock, which I think masked the pain he was in. 'The force of it shook the foundations of my home - it was an incredibly powerful explosion and the walls just shuddered.' Another neighbour, Eileen Priest, 40, added: 'There was an almighty explosion and the house just shook to the core. West Midlands Police said the circumstances surrounding the explosion had not yet been confirmed and an investigation would be launched . A force spokesman said the arrested men were still in hospital this morning but their injuries are not described as life-threatening . 'My daughter said she actually saw a bloke running away from the scene in shorts. 'It was like a bomb going off and has obliterated the front of the property. I thought it was a car crash at first. 'We've had police, ambulance and fire all here, there were flashing blue lights everywhere. It is very shocking.' Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, added: 'I was watching X-Factor when I heard this incredible bang and I looked outside and parts of the house were in my front garden. 'The blast had sent parts of the building just catapulting across the street - I could see door handles in the middle of the street. 'It was a noise like I had never heard, it left a ringing in my ears for a long time. I can't describe it. It was terrifying.' A parked police car remained outside the home in the West Heath area of Birmingham this morning where an investigation is underway . The men, one aged in his 20s and the other in his 30s, are said to be in a 'serious' condition in hospital after the gas explosion tore apart the front of the property in the West Heath area of Birmingham just after 8pm . The sudden explosion last night ripped off the front of the two-storey house, including the front door and a window . West Midlands Police said yesterday: 'The full extent of the damage to the building and neighbouring properties is still being established. 'The cause of the explosion is not known but emergency gas crews are on their way to the scene. 'People in the area are being asked to return to their homes if safe to do so to give blue light services clear access.' A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman added: 'On arrival, crews found two men who had reportedly been inside the property at the time of the explosion, both of whom had suffered serious burns injuries. 'The first patient, a man in his 30s, was treated for burns to his arm, head and back. Teams of emergency workers could be seen inspecting the house this evening to establish the cause of the explosion . Shaken neighbours described the sound of the blast as 'like a bomb going off' as debris was flung up to 40ft away . 'The second patient, a man in his 20s, was treated for burns to his back, neck, hands and arms. 'Both patients were given pain relief on scene before being transferred to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. 'A third patient from a nearby property was assessed on scene but did not require hospital treatment. 'The cause of the explosion is unknown.'

"Google has come under fire for allowing users to download a game from its app store encouraging hunters to shoot dead naked homosexuals. The technology giant has removed Ass Hunter from its app store, Google Play, after it was downloaded more than 10,000 times. Sickeningly, it encouraged users: 'your mission is to kill as many gays as possible' before advancing to the next level. Scroll down for video . Google has come under fire for listing a game which encourages users to shoot naked homosexuals . The app sees players hunt down homosexual men with shotguns for points. On its listing on Google Play, the game's provider is listed as App Day, though the company denies ever producing such content. It has been removed from Google Play since being listed on November 5, but can still be downloaded on other app sites for free. In its description, it says: 'Gays may be hidden in bushes and unexpectedly catch you. 'Remember! When they catch you they will do with you whatever they want.' A score of disgusted internet users commented on the game's content in the review section before it was taken off the website. 'This developer is despicable. I cannot comprehend how someone could create a ""game"" so wilfully ignorant, hateful, vile and violence,' one user said. The app was downloaded thousands of times before being removed from Google . 'Do you realize that young gay men and women are attacked all the time, and your game could be the incentive for someone to act on their ignorance? 'Normalizing violence is never okay. By creating and publishing this ‘game,’ you’re sending the message that you condone such violence. 'Shame. Shame on you. I will not rest until your developer account is deleted and you are laughed into obscurity.' Others described the game as 'sickening'. Gay rights charity Stonewall said the game could have a 'damaging' effect on young people. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'Its shocking that a company like Google who pride themselves on cutting edge technology would feature a game with attitudes more likened to the last century. 'This will be incredibly offensive to a lot of people. We're glad to see they've acted quickly to take it down but technology companies have a responsibility to help protect people, particularly young people from incredibly offensive material which portrays gay men as predators and with characters whose sole mission it is is to murder. 'It's an incredibly damaging message'. Despite removing the app earlier today, Google declined to comment on the game or respond to accusations of homophobia. Grahame Robertson, from The Lesbian & Gay Foundation, said: 'This game is a despicable form of homophobia which is nothing short of an incitement of violence towards gay and bisexual men. The 'sickening' app places the player as the hunter in a virtual world where they are told to kill or evade homosexuals to win points and advance to the next stage . Disgusted internet users shamed Google for listing the app on its Play store in the review section of the site . 'Google have a moral responsibility as a global brand to demonstrate that they will not accept such frighteningly homophobic apps or games such as this. 'Google's silence over this issue is extremely worrying.' Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell also slammed the tech giant for refusing to apologise for the Ass Hunter blunder. Peter said: 'It's shocking that anyone would want to create a violent, homophobic 'game.' 'I'm glad that Google have deleted it, but surprised and disappointed that they have not issued a clear and public condemnation of it. 'Such a vile, violent inflammatory game clearly violates Google's ethical policies, and clearly it should not have been downloaded thousands upon thousands of times before deletion. 'I would expect Google to issue a strongly-worded condemnation and apology. 'Their silence is baffling. 'Even when big companies make unintentional mistakes, even if they have had no direct control over the incident, they usually issue robust apologies. 'I'm really shocked that Google have not done this.'","Google listed Ass Hunters on its Android store Google Play in November .

"A huge family tree linking 13 million people could solve some longstanding mysteries about how some human traits are influenced by genes. A team of researchers at Cambridge, Massachusetts, looked at 43 million public profiles on the genealogy website Geni.com. Public profiles on this site, which include that of Kate Middleton and Barack Obama, reveal information such as location, birth dates and family links. Scroll down for video... A team of researchers at Cambridge, Massachusetts looked at 43 million public profiles on the genealogy website Geni.com which is run by MyHeritage . Dr Yaniv Erlich and his team at the Whitehead Institute constructed the world’s largest family tree from the data, which stretches back to the 15th Century. 'Using this information, we constructed a single pedigree of 13 million individuals spanning many generations up to the 15th century and validated its quality using unilineal Y chromosome and mitochondira markers,' the authors wrote in the abstract to their study. The research has not yet been published, but as a proof of concept, the team analysed the immigration patterns of individuals in these family trees, displaying them graphically in a time lapse. FamiLinx is a scientific resource of genealogical and demographic data from tens of millions of people mostly from the last 500 years. The starting point of FamiLinx was the public information on Geni.com, a genealogy-driven social network that is operated by MyHeritage. Geni.com allows genealogists to enter their family trees into the website and to create profiles of family members. 'The main advantage of FamiLinx is its ultra-large pedigrees. The largest pedigree has 13 million individual,' claims the site. 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest pedigree compiled for scientific studies. ‘It’s interesting to see the correlation between historical events and migration partners,’ Dr Erlich told MailOnline. 'For instance, we know the Mayflower arrived in 1620 to New England and we can see this in our data.’ Anyone can log online and contribute their details to the website, but it may take a while before the results are condensed into useful information for genetic scientists. The names have been stripped from the data to protect privacy. ‘We have given the anonymous data to the wider scientific community to use in their projects,’ Dr Erlich said. ‘There may be someone out there who can find things out from our data that we’ve missed.’ Anyone can log online and contribute their details to the website, but it may take a while before the results are condensed into useful information for genetic scientists . The changes in certain traits can show how much a human characteristic is linked to genetics . Previous data available for genetic studies contained hundreds of thousands of family members at best. The work, presented by computational biologist Dr Erlich at the American Society of Human Genetics annual meeting in Boston, could aid in the understanding of how genes contribute to certain traits. Even more useful, however, is the possibility that this gene information could be linked to medical information. By comparing someone to their ancestors, the degree of change in certain traits can reveal how much that characteristic is linked to genetics. However, Dr Erlich admitted that the self-reported genealogical data may not be completely accurate. ‘We are not confident that it is all correct,’ he said. ‘…the end point of this process is to advance our biomedical knowledge and data such as this can be hugely valuable.’","The data was compiled using 43 million public profiles on Geni.com .

"Three cops who posted a picture of their Portland Police Department’s badge and a banner across it that said, ‘I am Darren Wilson’ were ordered to remove the images from their personal Facebook pages. In a statement released on Monday, police chief Mike Reese said he had ordered the removal of the image once he had been alerted to what the officers had done. ‘The image displayed does not represent this organization and was very inflammatory in nature,’ he said. Three cops who posted this picture of their Portland Police Department’s badge and a banner across it that said, 'I am Darren Wilson' were ordered to remove the images from their personal Facebook pages . Reese also said officers have the right to express their own personal opinion, ‘but not using an official badge of the Portland Police Bureau.’ The officers who posted the controversial image have been named by Oregon Live as Rich Storm, Rob Blanck and Kris Barber. Oregon Live reported that Storm still had his badge post on his page as of 12:36 p.m., which drew 'likes' from 30 others, many of whom are Portland police officers. Reese has asked the Professional Standards Division to review this matter for possible policy violations. Police officer Darren Wilson, right, shot unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August . Police chief Mike Reese ordered the removal of the image once he had been alerted on Monday . Portland Mayor Charlie Hales also issued a statement in which he accused the officers of ‘making a political statement’ by altering the city's official badges. ‘Chief Reese did the right thing by immediately ordering the officers to remove these symbols, and by ordering Professional Standards Division to review this matter for possible policy violations,’ Hales said in the statement. The mayor added, 'Recently, police participated in specific dialog related to possible reactions to the upcoming release of a verdict from the grand jury in Ferguson, Mo. 'The actions taken by these three officers here in Portland do not help get us to that goal.' The August 9 shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson by Officer Darren Wilson inflamed tensions in the predominantly black St. Louis suburb that is patrolled by an overwhelmingly white police force. As Brown's body lay for hours in the center of a residential street, an angry crowd of onlookers gathered. Rioting and looting occurred the following night, and police responded with armored vehicles and tear gas. Protests continued for weeks - often peacefully, but sometimes turning violent, with demonstrators throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails and police firing smoke canisters, tear gas and rubber bullets. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon traveled to St. Louis from the Capitol on Monday in advance of the grand jury announcement. He was to speak with St. Louis-area clergy on a conference call and then hold a news conference at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Pastors were planning a rally and prayer service later on Monday at the West Side Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency in Ferguson and called in National Guard troops to back up police, which protesters have criticized as heavy-handed . 'There's a lot of hurt, a lot of brokenness. There's anger and frustration on every side,' said the Rev. Ronald Bobo Sr., the church's pastor. 'We need the hand of God to lead us and guide us.' The 12-person grand jury has been meeting in secret for months, hearing evidence from a wide variety of witnesses as it decides whether Wilson's should face charges that could range from involuntary manslaughter to murder. The grand jurors could decide not to charge Wilson at all. At the lower end of the possible charges is second-degree involuntary manslaughter, which is defined as acting with criminal negligence to cause a death. It is punishable by up to four years in prison. The most serious charge, first-degree murder, can be used only when someone knowingly causes a death after deliberation and is punishable by either life in prison or lethal injection.","The cops had posted a picture of their Portland Police Department's badge and a 'I am Darren Wilson' banner across it on  their Facebook pages .

"There has been an increase in reports of the sexual abuse of children being streamed live over the internet on services like Skype, it has today been revealed . Live footage of children being abused is becoming increasingly available over the internet on services like Skype, child exploitation experts have today warned. Officers have noted an increase in the number of offenders who target vulnerable families overseas and pay them to set up live access to children over . webcams in exchange for payment. In a report, published today, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre has flagged the practice as an emerging threat after it saw an increase in the number of images and videos shared in 2012. In its annual threat assessment of . child sexual exploitation and abuse, Ceop also warned that there are . increased fears of child sexual abuse in Brazil as more visitors head . there over the coming years for the World Cup and Olympic Games. In 2012, Ceop received 8,000 reports of . indecent images of children being shared, and has reported a two-fold . increase in the number of images and videos on previous years to 70,000. Peter Davies, Ceop chief executive called for a 'zero tolerance' attitude to child sexual exploitation'. He said: 'It’s part of CEOP’s job to inform the public and our partners about how our understanding of the risk to children from sexual exploitation and abuse is developing. 'Every year we refresh our assessment and build our operational plans around it.  This year, of course, our assessment will also feed into the wider efforts of the National Crime Agency, whose mission is to protect the public and cut crime. 'Events of the last year show that interest in protecting children, both online and offline, has never been greater and we hope that sharing what we know with as many other people as possible will help make children safer. 'Our assessment shows that, sadly, there are still too many children at risk and too many people who would cause them serious harm. We should all practice zero tolerance to child sexual exploitation and abuse.' Live streaming was firsy identified as an emerging method of producing and distributing indecent images last year, the report said. And Ceop warned that this tactic - particularly in the developing world - continues to carry a high risk this year. Sex offenders are targeting families and children in areas with extreme poverty, rising levels of access to the internet and poor child protection policies, the report said. The centre also raised concerns about the use of the so-called hidden internet - heavily encrypted forums and pages that allow abusers to cover their tracks when accessing indecent images online. UK daily users connecting to secret or encrypted networks increased by two thirds, one of the largest annual increases globally, the report said, with 20,000 daily UK users of such networks expected by the end of this year, although not all of these will use the hidden internet for criminal means. Meanwhile, Ceop found that there has been a 70 per cent increase in the number of female victims under 10 years old. The report comes shortly after after five members of a seven-man sadistic paedophile ring found guilty of grooming vulnerable underage girls were given life sentences at the Old Bailey. Two other defendants were both jailed for seven years. Offenders target vulnerable families overseas and pay them to set up live access to children over webcams in exchange for payment, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) has found . Ceop said that a number of offenders have been identified as targeting teenagers and young adults on the basis of their vulnerability rather than due to a specific sexual interest in children. These are known as 'type one' offenders and crimes. And figures from police forces show that the majority of type one offenders were categorised as Asian, and 97 per cent of type one offences involved white victims. But figures from 25 police forces revealed 2,120 lone perpetrators and 31 forces reported 65 group or gang related offences. An NSPCC spokeswoman said: 'The evidence the NSPCC has gathered from all police forces in England and Wales shows there are around 20,000 sexual offences against children reported every year and many of the victims are under primary-school age. 'However, we believe this is far from the true situation as many cases are never revealed. And since the Savile sex crimes were revealed, our helpline has experienced an increase in the number of adults reporting cases which happened many years, even decades, earlier. 'While there are cases of children being sexually assaulted by strangers, the vast majority of these offences - around nine out of 10 - are committed by someone the child knows. 'It is crucial that our efforts to protect children from sexual abuse focus on deterrence and prevention and that our focus is the risk to children, both on and offline.' Other key findings show that approximately 190,000 UK children (1 in 58) will suffer contact sexual abuse by a non-related adult before turning . 18, with approximately 10,000 new child victims of contact sexual abuse . being reported in the UK each year. Policing and criminal justice minister Damian Green has labeled the findings 'deeply troubling' Policing and criminal justice minister Damian Green said: 'These figures are deeply troubling and show how our understanding of child sexual exploitation has greatly improved in recent years. Police are bringing more cases before the courts and significant sentences are being handed down to perpetrators. 'But more needs to be done. CEOP is doing excellent work and we will see its capability strengthened when it is transferred to the National Crime Agency later this year. 'I am leading a new Home Office group which is urgently looking at how we better identify those at risk, create a more victim-focused culture within the police, health and children's services, improve data-sharing and address cultural barriers to uncovering abuse. 'Together, as communities, we need to ensure these sickening crimes no longer remain hidden.' Javed Khan, chief executive of independent charity Victim Support, said: 'It is sadly no surprise that the threat of child sexual abuse and exploitation is increasing in the UK. 'We know from recent high profile court cases, including in Oxford and Telford, that children and vulnerable adults remain at risk of extreme abuse, corruption and trafficking at the hands of a criminal underworld - creating what can only be described as modern day sexual slavery. 'But the police service must also ask itself some searching questions. It's first priority is to prevent and detect crime. 'Yet the national threat assessment has had to fill gaps because of inconsistencies in the way forces collect, record and categorise child sex abuse offences. ' It is essential that every dot is joined-up if the most vulnerable in our society are to be protected. 'Every police force must therefore contribute fully and consistently to the national intelligence picture. Only then will we have a true picture of the scale of the problem.'","Offenders target vulnerable families and pay them to set up live access .

"The rotting corpses of 500 sea lions have washed up on a beach in Peru, prompting accusations that fishermen harvesting shellfish poisoned them. Sea lion cubs were among the hundreds of dead bodies found on a bay in Santa province in the north-west of the South American nation, about 250 miles north of the capital Lima. Police are investigating a complaint made the governor of the local Samanco district, who believes the creatures were poisoned by marine farmers harvesting shellfish. The rotting corpses of 500 sea lions have washed up on a beach in Peru, prompting accusations that fishermen harvesting shellfish poisoned them (file picture) Sea lions often come close to the shore to look for seafood and scallops to eat, but may have ingested poison while doing so. City council workers quickly hauled away the mass of decomposing corpses as they were a public health risk. The bodies of another 187 sea lions were found in the Piura region of Peru along with four dead dolphins and the corpses of sea turtles and dozens of pelicans earlier this month. How the animals came to die remains a mystery and wildlife officials are still investigating the deaths. Detectives are yet to rule out disease, fishing nets, hunting or eating plastic rubbish disposed of in the Pacific Ocean by humans as possible causes. Sea lion cubs were among the hundreds of dead bodies found on a bay in Santa province in the north-west of the South American nation, about 250 miles north of the capital Lima . In 2012, hundreds more dolphins were founded dead on Peruvian beaches. An environmental group blamed the deaths on the noise and waves caused by explosions made by oil exploration nearby. However, a government report said natural causes, such as an infection, were to blame for their deaths.","Hundreds of dead sea lions have washed up on a beach in Peru .

The 63-year-old had been released from prison just a year before the attack in February this year. He was freed after serving 34 years of a life sentence for raping a teenager at knifepoint in 1978. Foster sneaked up behind the young girl as she was looking for a doll to buy with her birthday money. He exposed himself and told her that he would buy her any toy she wanted if she showed him her underwear. The girl ran away and was found sobbing in another aisle by store staff, whom she told of the encounter. Foster was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison at Preston Crown Court today after he admitted causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. The victim’s father said in a statement that he was now 'very concerned about letting his children out of sight in public' and said that he 'wanted to kill' the man. He said: 'It happened in 30 seconds. My children wanted to look at different aisles. I was walking from the skateboard aisle to check on her when I heard the Tannoy calling me. 'My daughter was in tears and the staff told me what had happened. I shouted and shouted for my son because I was afraid the man was still in the store. I was relieved it hadn’t been any worse. 'It doesn’t seem to have affected her too much luckily, but it may do when she’s older. It’s really affected us. 'Since it happened I am on pins when I’m out with them, I never let them out of my sight.' Foster, pictured in CCTV footage from the store, sneaked up behind the young girl as she was looking for a doll to buy with her birthday money. He exposed himself to her and asked to see her underwear . CCTV footage revealed that Foster had come in and out of the store in Deepdale Retail Park on five separate occasions on the day of the attack. He was seen wearing a hat and glasses on some of the visits, which police believe was done to try and alter his appearance. He was caught after a probation officer recognised pictures of Foster when they appeared in a local newspaper. It emerged he had a record for sex offences dating back to 1966, when, then aged 15, he attacked and molested a 32-year-old woman while she was pushing a pram. He appeared in court but was later released on probation. In that same year, Foster molested an eight-year-old girl who he saw walking alone - and was once again released on probation. The following year he was sent to a secure mental hospital after he beat up and threatened to rape a 76-year-old woman on her own doorstep. Foster, seen in CCTV footage from the shop, was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison at Preston Crown Court today after he admitted causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity . But in May 1978 he struck again while he was still a psychiatric patient at Whittingham Hospital in Preston. He had been allowed out with an escort to attend a motor mechanic’s college course but targeted a 19-year-old girl when he saw her get off a bus while he was travelling back to the hospital. Foster followed her and dragged her into a shed where he raped her at knifepoint. He was caught after two boys saw him fleeing the scene and followed him back to the hospital. When Foster was caught he told hospital staff: 'I’ll say I did it to get you off my back. You’re always at me. I’ll be better off inside. Let the State keep me.' CCTV footage revealed that Foster had come in and out of the store in Deepdale Retail Park, pictured above, on five separate occasions on the day of the attack in February . He was given life imprisonment after he was convicted of rape but was released on 13 December 2012. An expert who questioned Foster after his most recent attack concluded that he was either 'unable or unwilling to control sexualised behaviour' and posed 'a significant risk of serious harm to the public'. Paul Cummings, prosecuting, said: 'Foster was first seen in the shop at 9.36am and this offence was committed around 4.15pm. We know from the footage he had been seen in the entrance entering the shop on at least four or five occasions. 'The impression was that he changed his appearance as he has gone in and out, sometimes he was wearing a woolen hat, sometimes he wasn’t, also glasses as well. 'The impression the police had was that he was trying to make his appearance look different.' Foster gave himself up when police were given his name. The victim identified him as her attacker after watching the CCTV. She is now said to be 'frightened' about going about on her own. In mitigation defence counsel Miss Jo Shepherd said: 'Having spent virtually all his adult life in custody, Mr Foster is quite institutionalised.' But passing sentence Judge Michael Byrne said: 'The defendant chose a place deliberately that children go to, a toy shop. 'CCTV footage records him as giving the impression that he is wandering around the shop looking for children to approach. 'In the circumstances I’m satisfied this conduct clearly demonstrates a significant degree of planning. ‘This court takes the view in this case that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm.'","Leslie Foster was seen loitering in the aisles of the shop in Preston .

"Stuart Kerner is accused of having sex with a 15-year-old pupil at Bexleyheath Academy in London, and friends of the girl said they warned police about the affair who said the pupil needed to complain . Friends of a 15-year-old girl who was allegedly having sex with her vice principal warned police about the affair but were told by officers they were powerless to act unless the girl complained herself, a court heard. Religious studies teacher Stuart Kerner, 44, allegedly had a secret relationship with the 15-year-old girl at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London. The married teacher is accused of having sex with the child in broom cupboards and locked offices across the school. The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told her friends she had had a relationship with the married teacher. Inner London Crown Court heard that a friend went with two others to police because they were concerned the teenager might be in danger, or that Kerner could do the same to someone else. Her friend told jurors: 'They said 'We can't do anything unless the actual person tells us about it'. 'We were going to go to the teachers about it, but we decided not to because we didn't think they would take it seriously because the police didn't. 'We were told by police there was nothing they could do. We thought, if they can't do anything no one else can help us.' Officers said they were powerless to act unless the girl, who was said to be 'besotted' with Kerner, complained herself. Police eventually intervened after the alleged affair was reported by the girl's relative. The court heard the pupil had a schoolgirl 'crush' on Kerner, who is said to have confided in her about his wife and children. Vanessa Morrison, Kerner's personal assistant at the school, said she believed the girl was obsessed with him and 'secretive', and would often follow the teacher around the school. She told jurors: 'I think she was absolutely obsessed with him. She followed him around and wanted to find out where he was. 'There were times when you would go into his office and she would be sitting there on some pretence.' Kerner is vice principal and a religious studies teacher at Bexleyheath Academy in south east London . Kerner has denied the charges of having sex with a child, as well as abusing his position of trust with the girl . She said she spoke to other support staff about her concerns but did not feel it was 'her place' to tell senior teachers. The court previously heard that Kerner and the girl allegedly had sex at his home. Jurors were told the affair was discovered when the girl’s mother looked at her phone and found ‘sexual material’ unrelated to the case. She challenged her daughter who revealed the relationship with her teacher, it was said. Kerner, who always went to work in a smart three-piece suit, denies two counts of sexual activity with a child. Kerner, from Aylesford, Kent, also denies six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.

"When CIA official and mother-of-three Jennifer Matthews was killed by a suicide bomber at her Afghan base, fingers were pointed in her direction. A report into the attack claimed that as the chief of the Khost unit, she had failed to properly vet an informant who had come to speak with officials. The informant slayed the al-Qaeda specialist and six other CIA operatives by detonating a vest of explosives, the Washington Post reported. Killed: CIA official Jennifer Matthews was killed by an Afghan suicide bomber in 2009. A report suggested she was to blame for not preventing the attack . Now, for the first time since the December 2009 attack, Matthews's husband has spoken out against the treatment of the mother of his children, who had volunteered for the mission in a bid to beat al-Qaeda. Speaking to the Post, Gary Anderson expressed his anger at the CIA for blaming his wife, claiming it should have trained her better. 'Why wasn't [the suicide bomber] checked in transit to the base?' Anderson asked, criticising the CIA for being seduced by the jihadist killer. He said one of the CIA operatives killed in the attack had expressed concern over the bomber's trustworthiness - yet nothing had been done. 'This stuff should have gone back to headquarters, and someone should have made a call,' Anderson said. While commentators did not mention Matthews by name initially, they pointed fingers at a 'mother of three' at the base. Killer: Humam Khalil al-Balawi was a double agent working for al-Qaeda and the U.S. He was visiting a base in Khost, Afghanistan when he detonated a bomb . Questions: One CIA officer had expressed concern over his trust-worthiness . They said she had gone against . trade-craft rules by congregating staff around the . building's entrance for the welcome of Humam Khalil al-Balawi, a Jordanian . doctor believed to have infiltrated al-Qaeda's top ranks. Detonating his life vest seconds . after climbing out of the car, he was able to bring down seven American . officials in one easy swoop. Matthews, hit in the neck and with her leg burned to the bone, died in a helicopter on the way to hospital. Husband Gary Anderson . It was not the first time the CIA agent had been blamed for an attack. A few years after the 9/11 attacks in . New York City, the CIA released a report recommending disciplinary . action against Matthews and others. It suggested the agency managers had not warned the FBI about two al-Qaeda members in the country since 2000. The CIA director declined to take any disciplinary action. In 2005, she moved to London to serve as chief counter terrorism liaison to the British intelligence services - a comparatively comfortable role that she filled for four years. She was joined by Anderson and her children at a central-London home, where a nanny cooked and they would enjoy British TV shows on a Saturday night, the Post reported. Sick: Al-Balawi set off his explosive-laden vest, killing seven . But the easy life was not one for Matthews, who was desperate to tackle al-Qaeda. When the job in Khost came up, Matthews snapped up the opportunity, former CIA . assistant director Charles E. Allen said. She was 'haunted' by the blame she . had received for 9/11, and hoped the tough work . would rid her record of the blemish. Anderson told the Post he is incensed by . how his wife was treated after her death, referencing an article by . former CIA operative Robert Baer. The GQ piece claimed the CIA chief, whom he named 'Kathy', was 'set up to fail' and 'in over her head', the Post reported. 'It was just mean,' Anderson, a chemist . living in Fredericksburg, Pennsylvania, said. 'It was like, ""Girls can't . do this stuff"".' While Anderson vehemently supports his wife, Matthews, who began focusing on al-Qaeda in the 1990s, has come under fire from her own relatives. Her uncle Dave Matthews, a former CIA official, told the Post: 'If Jenny followed trade-craft rules, this wouldn't have happened ... She wasn't trained.' Aftermath: CIA director Leon E. Panetta addresses CIA employees weeks . after the attack. It raised questions about how the . agency could protect its operatives . Anderson remembered: 'About a week before the funeral, Dave said she didn't know what she was doing. And this was her fault. I was like, ""Okay, we're done"".' He told the Post he is working hard to be a good single parent to his bereaved children. He recounted the moment he told his daughter, now 14, and two sons, 11 and nine, about their mother's death. 'I just said to them, ""Your mom has died"". The two oldest fell apart. They started crying,' he said. 'One of them asked, ""Is this really true?"" I just kind of hugged them.' He added: 'They just miss their mom.' Source: The Washington Post .","Jennifer Matthews had left comfortable London job for dangerous role tackling terrorism in Afghanistan .

"Fans of the beautiful game paid to watch former stars in the 'Battle of the South Americans' between Brazil and Argentina at the weekend. One of the greats on display for the showpiece occasion between the footballing giants was Claudio Caniggia, who won 50 caps for Argentina. However the Caniggia on show - despite wearing his customary number number 7 shift - was not the skilful winger who netted 16 goals in the famous blue and white shirt. In fact, it was fellow Argentine Daniel Cordone, who was once declared the Premier League's worst transfer after an ill-fated spell at Newcastle United. The number 7 on show at the 'Masters' match was not Claudio Caniggia but Newcastle flop Daniel Cordone . Caniggia, a close friend of Diego Maradona, won 50 caps for his country and scored 16 goals . Cordone enjoyed a dismal time at Newcastle, playing only 21 times - he has never represented his country . After the game, organisers insisted Cordone was Caniggia and the event's promoter Andre de Paula said: 'This is the Caniggia, the real Caniggia. There is no other Caniggia.' However, suspicions were raised when Cordone ran straight to the dressing room at the final whistle and refused to speak to the media. And his guise was eventually caught out when it emerged the former Newcastle striker has a visible tattoo on his right-arm, unlike Caniggia. One fan told local media that he was so angry at the 'fake' Caniggia that he left the stadium early, while another added: 'I am very disappointed. I am an admirer of Argentine football and I wanted to see the match, and get autographs.' The match finished 3-3, with Esteban Fuertes and Ruggeri (2) on the scoresheet for Argentina. Petkovic, Beto and Souza netted for Brazil. Cordone tried to fool the spectators in to thinking he was the former Argentina player - he is pictured here tackling Brazil's former player Adilio during the match at Dunas stadium in Natal . Cordone even took on free-kick responsibility under the guise of Argentina great Caniggia during the game . The forward began his footballing career at Velez Sarsfield in his home country, which earned him a move to Newcastle United for a fee of £500,000 in 2000. However, in a disappointing spell in the North East he played only 21 times and scored three goals against Derby, Tottenham and Bradford in the League Cup. His time at Newcastle earned him the unfortunate title of the worst transfer in Premier League history. After leaving Newcastle, he played for a string of teams in Argentina. He was never capped by his country. The skilful winger started his career at River Plate, before moving to European giants Roma and Benfica. He then joined River Plate's bitter rivals, Boca Juniors before signing for Dundee and then Rangers in Scotland, where he enjoyed cult-hero status. He won 50 caps for Argentina, scoring 16 goals. He is a close friend of Argentina's greatest ever-player Diego Maradona and had a reputation for enjoying the high-life. He was banned for 13 months in 1993 after testing positive for cocaine.","Former Newcastle flop Daniel Cordone impersonated Claudio Caniggia .

"Channel 4 will screen a controversial documentary tonight in which a paedophile speaks openly about his attraction to four-year-old girls. The broadcaster has been criticised by victim support campaigners for giving airtime to the 39-year-old man, called Eddie, and encouraging him to discuss his urges. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood [NAPAC] said victims would be ‘offended’ by the film and said it should have devoted its airtime and resources to helping people who have been abused as children. Scroll down for video . Candid: Eddie appears on the Channel 4 documentary to speak about his attraction to young girls . Self-confessed paedophile Eddie, 39, (pictured) will admit to being sexually attracted to children as young as four in a Channel 4 documentary, but insists he has never committed a crime . However, other charities including the NSPCC praised the programme for shining a light on the need to treat paedophiles before they abuse children or view under-age pornography. In The Paedophile Next Door, a series of experts argue that men like Eddie – who claims he has never offended and who has no criminal record – should not be treated like ‘evil monsters’. The programme makers suggest paedophiles should be given more support to help them control their urges before they offend. They persuaded Eddie, who did not give his surname, to talk openly about his own experiences despite the risk of reprisals. He said he first realised he was a paedophile in his mid-20s. ‘It is not the only thing I am but it plays a large part in the make-up of who I am as a person,’ he said. ‘I would much prefer not to have these feelings and these attractions but I have them, and that’s difficult. I have an age of attraction that starts, depending on the individual, as low as five, roughly. Four, five, six.’ The show’s makers said police have no record of Eddie having been convicted and he insisted he had never abused a child. He said: ‘A lot of people automatically assume that because I think or feel that way, then I am potentially going to abuse a child … I certainly don’t want to do that kind of thing.’ He suggests it is easier for him not to act on any urges as he is ‘attracted to women of all ages’. Eddie said he decided to show his face on national television because he feels paedophiles should be treated for their urges rather than being demonised. Viewers will also see Eddie meet Ian McFadyen, 49, who was abused by a teacher at Caldicott School, Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire (pictured) as a young boy . ‘People will probably say “Why isn’t this guy locked up. We should kill this guy,’ he said. ‘People are just waiting for you to offend before they help you. If you don’t have that help, if you don’t have the option to come forward and say “Look I’ve got a problem, I need help”, then what are you changing? You’re changing nothing.’ Peter Saunders, NAPAC’s chief executive, said: ‘This documentary shines the light in the wrong areas. Instead of feeling sorry for poor misunderstood paedophiles, we should be looking at the awful experiences of those who have been abused.’ However, Jon Brown, from the NSPCC, said the film was ‘fantastic’ and that paedophilia is a ‘public health problem’ that needs to be addressed by treating potential offenders as well as punishing them after an offence. He said there are around 250,000 paedophiles in the UK, and predicted many will contact helplines after seeing the film. Eddie has gone to Europe to be treated by a support group that helps paedophiles control their urges. The documentary also interviewed Ian McFadyen, who was abused at Caldicott Prep School in the 1960s and 1970s while a contemporary of Nick Clegg. Mr McFadyen said: ‘I’m not here to defend paedophiles but he has not committed a crime.’ The Paedophile Next Door will be broadcast on Channel 4 tonight at 9pm.

"The Catholic Church has called for Halloween to be scrapped and replaced with 'Holyween' - a night in which children would attend prayer vigils and dress up as saints. The Vatican's first official conference of exorcists warned of a danger to young people at Halloween when there is an increase in occult activity. Father Aldo Buonaiuto, of the International Association of Exorcists, which met in Rome at the weekend, said that a spike in demonic possessions in October is down to the phenomenon of Halloween. The organisation's emergency number receives hundreds of calls over this period, around 40 a day, especially from parents who fear that their child has been initiated into the occult, he said. Spooked: Pope Francis scares a child as he tries to greet him during his general audience at St Peter's square. The Vatican has called for Halloween to be called 'Holyween' to cut the amount of occult acitivity . Pope Francis warned the conference of exorcists that they must treat those possessed with 'kindness' He said: 'Many say Halloween is a simple carnival, but in fact there is nothing innocent or fun about it - it is the antechamber to something much more dangerous. 'There are always more evil rituals, animal sacrifices, desecrations of cemeteries and thefts of sacred bones at the time of the 31 October. Participating in Halloween is 'like an initiation into the occult', he said. 'For the sects it is the best time of year to recruit new members. From here the door to the devil can be opened. For this reason its necessary for us to speak out and not play down the danger.' To replace the 'dangerous' festival the Catholic Church in Italy have now launched the initiative 'Holyween', he said. 'While most people are seeped in zombies and horror we put on our door or windows a light or an image evocative of the saints.

'And then there will be masses, prayer vigils and worship to celebrate the saints and victory of good over evil.' The conference of 300 exorcists from all over the world took place over the weekend after being officially recognised by the Vatican in June. At the conference, Pope Francis warned them that they must treat those possessed with 'kindness'. He wrote in a message: 'Those who perform this particular ministry, in conjunction with the bishops' must work 'with love and kindness from the church towards those who suffer because of the evil one'. More than many of his predecessors, Pope Francis likes to insist that Satan is real and speaks frequently about the Devil's work. Last year he was captured performing an apparent exorcism. In astonishing footage he placed his hands on the head of a boy in a wheelchair, reciting an intense prayer until the boy slumped down exhaling sharply.","Vatican's first conference of exorcists warned of dangers to children .

"Charities have criticised the sentence handed to a 22-year-old dance coach who had sex with two 15-year-old girls - but avoided jail after a judge said he had their 'fulsome consent'. Jon Broni admitted two charges of sexual activity with a child after carrying on illegal relationships with both girls at once for six months. A judge at Manchester Crown Court said that while the behaviour was 'utterly inappropriate', it did not warrant a prison term or any hours of unpaid work. Spared jail: Dance coach Jon Broni (left and right outside Manchester Crown Court) had sexual relationships with two underage girls at once, but was handed a community order after insisting he had consent . Instead Broni will attend a sex offenders’ treatment programme, and has been handed a five-year sexual offences prevention order which will limit his contact with children. The judge in the case said the girls had given their 'fulsome consent' and there had been 'complete consensual compliance'. But leading charities said the law of consent exists to protect youngsters from themselves. Yvonne Traynor, chief executive of the Rape & Sexual Abuse Support Centre, said: 'The laws in this country are quite clear to protect young women from sexual predators. 'Everyone understands the age of consent so there can be no sympathy for a man who flouts the laws in this country. 'This was clearly a case of grooming and rape of young women and the sentence should reflect the seriousness of this heinous crime.' Jon Brown, head of the NSPCC’s programmes tackling sexual abuse, added: 'It is not possible for someone under 16 to consent to sex legally. 'This law is there to protect children and young people who think they are old enough and believe they are in a loving relationship when actually the older person has taken advantage of them. 'This is made even worse when the adult is working with young people and employed in a position of trust. The adult must always take full responsibility and even if the judge decides a jail sentence is not appropriate this man can clearly not be trusted to work with children and young people again.' Celebrity: Broni posed for a photo with Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan at a previous event . During the case Broni, of Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, was described as a former up-and-coming star in Manchester's street dance scene. He organised much of his own choreography and opened his own Boulevard studios in Salford, Greater Manchester, at the age of 21. Broni attended high-profile events and had mingled with celebrities including Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan. But Manchester Crown Court heard he began illegal relationships with the two underage girls towards the end of 2012. Sex between someone aged 15 or under and someone aged 16 or over is always illegal in Britain. However, the Sexual Offences Act distinguishes slightly between children aged 12 or under and those aged 13, 14 or 15. Children aged 12 or under cannot legally consent to sex, which means cases are always prosecuted as rapes or sexual assaults. Children aged between 13 and 15 sometimes maintain that they agreed to sex, but in legal terms they still cannot give consent. In these cases offenders are often charged with 'sexual activity with a child', which carries a lesser sentence. But such activity is still illegal because children are vulnerable and need to be protected - and it is the adult's responsibility to stop it from happening in the first place. One victim's parents allowed them to date as long as there was no sex 'until she was ready', the court heard. He had sex with one of the girls when she stayed overnight at his studios, the court heard. On another occasion one of the girls took a naked photo of herself in the shower, which was later discovered by her mother. It was only then, in May 2013, that police were called. Neither of the girls knew about the other, and during the relationships he told both of them: 'You can’t help who you fall in love with'. After the case unravelled the girls felt ‘tricked and sullied’, the court heard. Lisa Judge, defending, said: 'Had these girls been kicking and screaming, he would have been charged with rape.' Miss Judge said her client was born with a large purple birthmark that left him ‘handsome’ on one side of his face and ‘disfigured’ on the other like ‘Phantom of the Opera’. He was bullied and isolated as he was subjected to repeated facial operations, she said. But she added: 'The victims were children and therefore needed protection. He failed to offer them that protection. 'His remorse is palpable. He’s lost everything - he is no Billy Elliot anymore. He’ll never work in a dance school again.' Caught: Manchester Crown Court heard Broni would 'never work in a dance school again' He had found his calling in dance, but had not fully matured, she added. Judge Martin Rudland said Broni had ‘exploited’ his friendship with the girls, and that while the age gap was not ‘significant,’ consent laws were there to protect the young and vulnerable from themselves. But he was spared jail by the judge, who said he had had the ‘fulsome consent’ of both girls. And the judge rejected the prospect that Broni had 'groomed' the girls when it was raised by the prosecutor earlier in the case. 'I really do think you have to be extremely careful with the use of this word grooming,' the judge said. 'There's grooming and there's grooming. 'My view is that the proper use of that term is where you have many years, a prolonged period of time, and someone in an extreme position of power... such as a stepfather or mother's partner who inculcates into a very young child the sense that utterly inappropriate sexual activity is the norm, by the use of inappropriate language or behaviour. 'That's not to say that in a situation like this there hasn't been a degree of manipulation, perhaps, but to characterise this with the use of the word grooming I think one has to be very careful.' Broni was sentenced him to a three-year community order with a requirement to attend a sex offenders’ programme. He was also handed a five-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order, which will restrict the contact he can have with children. Sentencing, the judge told him: 'Here there was complete consensual compliance, insofar as these two girls were concerned in incremental sexual activity which took place between you and them. 'There is no doubt society condemns sexual misconduct generally and of this type. There is an age of consent in this country and it is 16, and any sexual activity under this age is unlawful. 'The age of consent is there to protect the young and vulnerable from themselves. 'You are still a very young man, still fairly immature yourself. Many years down the line that age disparity between you and the female partner would not be thought to be inappropriate at all, but when the girl is under 16 it is utterly inappropriate.'","Jon Broni  ran his own studio in Salford which he had opened aged 21 .

"Gwynne Harford, 86, considered herself too old to go on a cruise ship but her friends convinced her otherwise and she had a great time until she cut her leg on the second last day of the trip. The Gold Coast  pensioner returned home to Queensland the following day and ended up spending five days in Pindara hospital but the drama didn't end there. The widow had to return to the emergency ward just 10 minutes after being discharged on Sunday when the driver of the maxi taxi, that the injured elderly lady was struggling to get into, slammed her left hand in the sliding door. Scroll down for video . Gwynne Harford, 86, considered herself too old to go on a cruise ship but her friends convinced her otherwise and she had a great time until she cut her leg on the second last day of the trip . Gwynne told Daily Mail Australia that the driver must not have been looking when he closed the door because she was standing in the doorway attempting to pull herself up into the seat. 'I said to him ""I can't get in here - I need help"" but he was nowhere to be seen,' she said. 'Then he must've appeared out of nowhere and slammed the door when I let out an almighty scream.' In a lot of pain and shock, the Robina resident went straight back into the emergency department. 'There was blood everywhere - the girls at reception were horrified,' she said. 'The doctor said I could have lost the top of my finger.' Gwynne, who received three stitches to her little finger, said she understood that the incident was a mistake but she was shocked that the driver didn't apologise. 'I saw the man's coat jacket as he put down my bags and then he turned around and walked out,' she said. The widower had to return to the emergency ward just 10 minutes after being discharged on Sunday when the driver of the maxi taxi, that the injured elderly lady was struggling to get into, slammed her left hand in the sliding door . 'He didn't utter a word, or say sorry, or ask how I was.' Dr Paul Pluss told Daily Mail Australia that he called the Gold Coast Cabs company to file a complaint about the incident. 'The poor lady was smashed up in a cab  - I explained that I was a doctor and it wasn't a trivial matter but I couldn't talk to a supervisor - I was even hung up on a couple of times.' 'I was also getting a machine message on the complaints line saying someone will call me back in four days,' Dr Pluss said. Gwynne told Daily Mail Australia that the driver must not have been looking when he closed the door because she was standing in the doorway attempting to pull herself up into the seat . 'It was very disappointing - they are supposed to be a serviced-based business who are looking after people.' Dr Pluss said the company's CEO called him the next day to say the matter was being taken very seriously and the incident was under investigation. He also said that the driver had already reported the accident to his work. Gwynne, who gets her stitches taken out on Tuesday - the day she turns 87 - is being a real trooper about the mishap and concedes things could have been much worse. Her spirits are high considering the impressive octogenarian is used to doing everything for herself including cooking, cleaning, gardening, shopping and driving . 'My leg and finger are both painful but there are thousands of people who are worse off than me so I don't feel so bad.' Her spirits are high considering the impressive octogenarian is used to doing everything for herself including cooking, cleaning, gardening, shopping and driving.

"Victor Matfield received a phone call after arriving in London on Sunday which brought home to him how times have changed since he eased out retirement a year ago – in Bermuda, of all places. The iconic Springbok lock is enjoying a new lease of life in Test rugby, after ending his playing career in 2011, only to subsequently have a change of heart. On Saturday, he will face England in the QBE series at Twickenham, having become South Africa’s most-capped player – which seemed a distant prospect when he was making a guest appearance on the veterans’ circuit. Twelve months ago, 37-year-old Matfield was having fun in the sun – helping his country win the World Rugby Classic in Bermuda, via victory against the Classic Lions in the final. It was all part of the grand plan to return to the elite level of the game. That was the first, tentative step in the process. Springbok lock Victor Matfield retired in 2011, only to  have a change of heart . ‘I went to Bermuda at the end of last year,’ he told Sportsmail on Monday. ‘By then I actually knew that I was going to play again so I almost felt like I would go there and see if my body was feeling right for it. I had been mountain-biking quite a bit so I had gone down to 99kg and I was skinny! ‘I went over and it was much slower, but it was pretty physical because most of the boys are 10-15kgs heavier than they should be! So the collisions were still really tough and it was just good to get back into it, see how my body felt and it felt alright. ‘What was nice was that I was the only guy there who was really in shape. All the other guys would have stints of about 20 minutes and come off, but I would play every minute of every game. There were a couple of beers after each game – and before each game too! Matfield will face England in the QBE series at Twickenham on Saturday . South Africa may look to parachute Patrick Lambie in at fly-half to face England at Twickenham on Saturday ahead of fast-rising star Handre Pollard. Meanwhile, Springboks attack coordinator and forwards coach Johann van Graan has singled out England’s scrum-half as one of their chief threats: ‘Twickenham is a place we love to play. We’re facing world-class players; we’ve a lot of respect for Danny Care.’ ‘We won the tournament, which made it even better. I got a call from the guys at the airport yesterday – the South African boys who were on their way there for this year’s tournament. They were missing me!’ While those former Boks are once again enjoying the laid-back charms of the Bermuda tournament, Matfield finds himself back at the sharp end of his profession – ready for a fifth personal appearance at Twickenham. He had finished playing in 2011 and did some TV punditry, as well as coaching with his provincial team, the Pretoria-based Blue Bulls. He had embraced retirement. But, behind the scenes, he was being coaxed into a return by his long-term mentor, Heyneke Meyer, the former Bulls and – briefly – Leicester coach, who had taken charge of the South Africa team after the last World Cup. ‘I always thought I would have loved to play under Heyneke in a Springbok team,’ said Matfield. ‘Then I retired in 2011 and when I did, I didn’t know who was going to be the coach. When he got the job, the first call he made was to me, to ask me to come out of retirement. He wanted me to come back in, to captain the side as well.’ At first, he resisted Meyer’s advances, but eventually, Matfield agreed to come out of retirement on the basis that he would play on until next year’s World Cup. There were other former Bulls coaches now working within the Boks’ set-up and the renowned second row thought to himself: ‘These guys can win the World Cup.’ He had misgivings though – fears even. ‘I was very happy retired and my wife was very happy as well, so it was something I had to discuss with her,’ he said. ‘When I retired, that was a big part of it, thinking, “I’ve had my stint, it’s time to get back to my family”, so when Heyneke asked me, the biggest thing I had to be sure was that my family would be alright if I did this for another two years. ‘Physically, fitness-wise, I always knew I would be fine. Lineout-wise, I was also confident because I was still involved with it, coaching the Bulls. I was going up against the guys and I found it pretty easy to win the lineouts against the current players, so I was happy with that. ‘But the physical contact was what I was scared of. Being older and after being out of it for two years – I had gone down to 99kg and I normally played at about 108, so I had to bulk up again. So I was definitely scared. ‘I also didn’t want to just come back, play two or three games and think, “Damn, I’m not going to make it”, not even make the Bok team and then just fade away. So there was a lot of pressure on me and I was a bit worried.’ Veteran Matfield is South Africa’s most-capped player after 117 appearances . Ultimately, Matfield’s concerns proved unfounded. Once he had withstood the ferocity of a heavily scrutinised Bulls comeback against South African rivals the Sharks in Durban early this year, he soon returned to the old routine and discovered that his body coped more effectively than it had done before his career hiatus. ‘I am definitely in much better nick than I was in 2011,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t get up in the mornings and I couldn’t walk down my stairs at home – I had to hold on. I think the two-year break helped my body a lot. Before that, I was just buggered! My body had seized up.’ Once he was up to speed again, a path back into the Springboks team opened up for him as other contenders in his position all succumbed to injury. ‘I was the only one left,’ he joked. His return soon led to him surpassing John Smit as his country’s most-capped player and later in the Rugby Championship he was at the heart of South Africa’s first win over the All Blacks since 2011. When news of his comeback went public, Matfield sensed a 50-50 split in media opinion at home. By the end of his first season back in the southern hemisphere’ s showpiece Test event, he had quelled any trace of resistance to his return. The sceptics had been silenced. Matfield insists the 2015 World Cup will be his swansong . Being a Bok again has meant being reunited with his long-term lock accomplice, the arch enforcer – Bakkies Botha. Matfield has savoured the reunion, both of them have; enjoying the notion that they are defying the passing of time. ‘It’s so funny, I knew I was going to come back last year and all of a sudden I saw that Bakkies was back in the squad for the end-of-year tour,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t believe it was real that the two of us were going to play together again. Every time we get on the bus, we sit at the back there and Bakkies says to me, “We’re still here. We’re still here. They can’t get rid of us!”.’ Yet, for Matfield, the end is in sight, for a second and final time. Whatever happens against England on Saturday, on the rest of this tour and over the next 10 months, the 2015 World Cup will be his swansong – no doubt at all. ‘The World Cup will be my last time playing,’ he said. ‘I have already signed a two-year deal with the Bulls for coaching. Everything is in place and this time there definitely won’t be any comeback out of retirement. No chance!’ When that time comes, Matfield will know what to do. Bermuda beckons.","Victor Matfield came out of retirement a year ago .

"CIA agents were envious of the glamorous treatment given to the real-lief tenacious operative who tracked Osama bin Laden for the better part of a decade, it was revealed today. Hollywood starlet Jessica Chastain plays the undercover analyst known as Maya, the woman who eventually finds the location of the then al-Qaeda leader. She is portrayed in a glamorous light – with wardrobes full of designer clothes and an enviable figure. But the real-life ‘Maya’ didn’t have it as easy as the strawberry-blonde Chastain; despite being one of the key people responsible for bin Laden’s demise, Maya was passed over for a promotion. Scroll down for video . Jealousy? Robert Baer, left, said that the CIA was and continues to be a boy's club, left, Valerie Plame, a former CIA officer herself said that she'd love to get a drink with the real-life 'Maya' Former CIA operative Bob Baer told the ‘TODAY’ show that it was unsurprising that the female CIA operative was looked over for a promotion that would have given her an additional $16,000 per annum. ‘It’s an old-boy network,’ he explained. ‘You don’t know why people are promoted, why people are held back, and often people think the worst.’ Valerie Plame, a CIA officer whose identity was leaked, told the show that she admired the operative’s moxy. ‘I’d love to have a drink with her one day,’ she said. The Washington Post’s David Ignatius told the ‘TODAY’ show that the response from the CIA was not unusual, saying that operatives are often ‘quite contrary,’ The reality of America’s battle against terrorism couldn’t have been more different to the glamorized, politically-correct fiction of Homeland, the hit TV show in which Claire Danes plays a beautiful CIA agent who spots the Al Qaeda plot which her misguided male colleagues have missed. CIA supersleuth: A attractive young female CIA agent, played by Jessica Chastain in the film Zero Dark Thirty, spent the best part of a decade to finding Bin Laden and became the SEALs' go-to expert on intelligence matters about their target . The world’s most dangerous terror group foiled by a killer blonde in Calvin Klein who wars with her superiors? Only in Hollywood’s dreams, surely. But, astonishingly, it has now emerged that truth may indeed be as strange as fiction. According to Zero Dark Thirty, a forthcoming film about the hunt for Bin Laden — whose makers were given top-level access to those involved — he might never have been found if it hadn’t been for an attractive young female CIA agent every bit as troublesome as Homeland’s Carrie Mathison. CIA insiders have confirmed claims by the film’s director Kathryn Bigelow that she is entirely justified in focusing on the role played by a junior female CIA analyst, named Maya in the film and played by Jessica Chastain. And just as in Homeland, the real agent has been snubbed by superiors and fallen out with colleagues since the Bin Laden raid in May last year. But who is this CIA supersleuth? Although the woman is still undercover and has never been identified, Zero Dark Thirty’s emphasis on Maya’s importance tallies with the account of a U.S. Navy SEAL involved in the raid who later wrote about it in a book. Bin Laden hunt: A very different side of the agent was seen days after Bin Laden's body was brought back. She even started crying . Matt Bissonnette writes in No Easy Day of flying out to Afghanistan before the raid with a CIA analyst he called ‘Jen’ who was ‘wicked smart, kind of feisty’ and liked to wear expensive high heels. She had devoted the best part of a decade to finding Bin Laden and had become the SEALs’ go-to expert on intelligence matters about their target, he said. And while her colleagues were only 60 per cent sure their quarry was in the compound in Abbottabad, she told the SEAL she was 100 per cent certain. ‘I can’t give her enough credit, I mean, she, in my opinion, she kind of teed up this whole thing,’ Bissonnette said later. The commando saw a very different side of her days later when they brought Bin Laden’s body back to their Afghan hangar. Having previously told Bissonnette she didn’t want to see the body, ‘Jen’ stayed at the back of the crowd as they unzipped the terrorist’s body bag. She ‘looked pale and stressed’ and started crying. ‘A couple of the SEALs put their arms around her and walked her over to the edge of the group to look at the body,’ wrote Bissonnette. ‘She didn’t say anything . . . with tears rolling down her cheeks, I could tell it was taking a while for Jen to process. She’d spent half a decade tracking this man. And now there he was at her feet.’ Jen’s role in the operation passed largely unremarked when Bissonnette’s book came out but now the new film — which is released in the UK in January — has confirmed his estimation of her importance. Although she remains active as a CIA analyst, it is believed Mark Boal, Bigelow’s screenwriter, was allowed to interview her at length. It has emerged that she is in her 30s and joined the CIA after leaving college and before the 9/11 attacks turned American security upside down. On target: The agent was one of the first to advance the theory that the key to finding Bin Laden lay in Al Qaeda's courier network which led to his compound (pictured is the attack scene in the movie) According to the Washington Post, she worked in the CIA’s station in Islamabad, Pakistan, as a ‘targeter’, a role which involves finding people to recruit as spies or to obliterate in drone attacks. But CIA insiders say she worked almost solely on finding Bin Laden for a decade. She was still in Pakistan when the hunt heated up after Barack Obama became President in 2008 and ordered a renewed effort to find him. According to colleagues, the female agent was one of the first to advance the theory — apparently against the views of other CIA staff — that the key to finding Bin Laden lay in Al Qaeda’s courier network. The agency was convinced Bin Laden, who never used the phone, managed to communicate with his disparate organisation without revealing his whereabouts by passing hand-delivered messages to trusted couriers. The agent spent years pursuing the courier angle, and it was a hunch that proved spectacularly correct when the U.S. uncovered a courier known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and tracked him back to a compound in the sleepy Pakistan town of Abbottabad. Fiesty: Jessica Chastain as agent Maya in Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Bin Laden . It was a stunning success for the dedicated agent, though she hardly endeared herself to her colleagues in the process. As one might expect of a woman . working in the largely male world of intelligence, colleagues stress she . is no shrinking violet but a prickly workaholic with a reputation for . clashing with anyone — even senior intelligence chiefs — who disagreed . with her. ‘She’s not Miss Congeniality, but that’s not going to find Osama Bin Laden,’ a former colleague told the Washington Post. Another . added: ‘Do you know how many CIA officers are jerks? If that was a . disqualifier, the whole National Clandestine Service would be gone.’ In . the film, Maya is portrayed as a loner who has a . ‘her-against-the-world’ attitude and pummels superiors into submission . by sheer force of will. CIA colleagues say the film’s depiction of her . is spot-on. If this is the case, then she shows . little of the feminine tenderness that serves Carrie Mathison so well in . Homeland and which Hollywood usually uses to soften female protagonists . like Maya. Instead, the film shows her happily colluding in the torture by waterboarding of an Al Qaeda suspect. And . Navy SEAL Bissonnette reported how she had told him she wasn’t in . favour of storming the Bin Laden compound but preferred to ‘just push . the easy button and bomb it’. Given that the bombing option would almost . certainly have killed the women and children the CIA knew were inside, . her comment suggests a cold indifference to  ‘civilian’ casualties. But then the real female agent is hardly your archetypal film heroine. She has reportedly been passed over for promotion since the Bin Laden raid, perhaps adding to her sense of grievance. Although she was among a handful of CIA staff rewarded over the operation with the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the agency’s highest honour, dozens of other colleagues were given lesser gongs. Fellow staff say this prompted her . anger to boil over: she hit ‘reply all’ to an email announcing the . awards and added her own message which — according to one — effectively . said: ‘You guys tried to obstruct me. You fought me. Only I deserve the . award.’ Although colleagues . say the intense attention she received from the film-makers has made . many of them jealous, they are shocked she was passed over for promotion . and merely given a cash bonus for her Bin Laden triumph. Glamorised fiction: The reality of America's battle against terrorism couldn't have been more different to the politically-correct hit TV show Homeland, in which Claire Danes plays a beautiful CIA agent who spots the Al Qaeda plot which her misguided colleagues missed . She has also been moved within the CIA, reassigned to a new counter-terrorism role. Bigelow, who won an Oscar as director of the Iraq war drama The Hurt Locker, has said it was like being dealt a Royal Flush at poker when she discovered a woman at the heart of the story. ‘The juicy thing about Maya was the surprise of it,’ she said. One thing is certain: The emotional cost of her achievement took its toll on her. Bissonnette recalls seeing her again as he and his comrades got on to a plane back to their main base at Bagram in Afghanistan. She was sitting on the floor of the plane sobbing, ‘hugging her legs to her chest in the fetal position’. Her eyes were ‘puffy and she seemed to be staring into the distance’. When he tried to reassure her that the mission had been a ‘100 per cent’ success, she simply nodded and started crying again. He put it down to a mixture of exhaustion and relief for a woman who had, with almost messianic zeal, dedicated her life to hunting down the architect of 9/11.

"Victim: Police have identified Vaibhev Loomba as the man who was found dead at Zeta Psi house in Berkeley, California, Sunday . A 20-year-old man was discovered dead at a fraternity near University of California at Berkeley following a party Saturday night. Police said they got a 911 call at around 12.10pm Sunday about an unresponsive male at 2728 Bancroft Way, the home of the Zeta Psi Greek organization. The victim has been identified by police as 20-year-old Vaibhev Loomba, an engineering student at University of California at Davis. The young man was found unresponsive in one of the upstairs rooms inside the frat house. Paramedics who responded to the address pronounced him dead at the scene. Loomba was said to be one of about 100 guests who attended the party organized by Zeta Psi Saturday night. He was not a member of the fraternity. Lt Ed Spiller said police have classified the death as 'suspicious.' Drugs and alcohol have not been ruled out as contributing factors. ‘We err on the side of caution, so we deem it suspicious until we can prove otherwise,’ Spiller told KTVU, adding that homicide detectives are looking into the case. No time of death has been given since investigators are not sure how long the 20-year-old had been dead before officers arrived. A witness told the local independent news site Berkeleyside that Vaibhev Loomba was discovered lying face down on the floor with vomit around his mouth. Scroll down for video .

Sad end: The victim's body was removed by the coroner's office after a four-hour investigation . Loomba's friends have been posting tributes on Facebook in memory of the seemingly popular engineering student. 'One of the most genuine guys I know, gone far too soon,' wrote Michael Riel. 'Save me a spot up there.' Loomba's high school friend Aidan Maguire shared a photo of himself posing with Loomba dressed as the Disney character Aladdin, writing on his Facebook page: ‘One of the greatest guys I may ever know. Always making me laugh and radiating positivity wherever he went. May he rest in peace and be forever remembered.’ According to his LinkedIn page, Loomba studied engineering at UC Davis and was expected to graduate in 2016. He was also the founder and CFO of a non-profit organization he had started with a relative last year.

"The audience sat transfixed as the beautiful ballerina and her handsome prince danced with extraordinary chemistry during the closing scenes of The Nutcracker. What the cheering Royal Opera House crowd didn’t know, however, was that the classic Tchaikovsky fairytale they just witnessed concealed a real-life secret – the most romantic of marriage proposals. It came as Clara, danced by Royal Ballet First Artist Leanne Cope, was asked for directions in the Land Of Sweets by the Nutcracker Prince, her childhood sweetheart Paul Kay. Childhood sweethearts Paul Kay and Leanne Cope, pictured in 2009, have married after Paul proposed on stage . Romance: They had performed their Nutcracker duet dozens of times - but Paul added a secret twist one night . It was a duet they had performed together dozens of times and required him to hand her a note. Only now – unbeknown to either Miss Cope or the audience – the note read: ‘Will you marry me?’ As she theatrically perused the words, her professionalism never faltered. Instead, she merely pointed and hurried off stage, as the storyline demanded. Moments later, as the curtain fell and enchanted ballet fans left the theatre, soloist Paul approached her backstage in front of the entire troupe. He dropped to one knee, presented her with a ring and popped the question verbally. Miss Cope said ‘yes’ and yesterday the proposal culminated in a spring wedding – the first of five female dancers with the company planning to tie the knot this year. ‘I was really surprised,’ she said. ‘Luckily, I was supposed to point the Nutcracker Prince in the right direction and run off stage. Dancing bride: Leanne, as Clara in The Nutcracker, is usually handed a note asking for directions to the Land Of Sweets during her duet with Paul. But she was left stunned one night when it in fact read: 'Will you marry me?' Wedded bliss: Leanne greets her bridesmaids as she arrives for her wedding to Paul in Bath yesterday . 'Paul had asked the stage manager for permission to switch the note. But the only people who knew were my mum and dad in the audience, as Paul had rung them to ask their permission to marry me.’ A spokesman for the Royal Ballet said: ‘As you might imagine, Leanne was somewhat taken aback on stage. ‘But as this happened right at the end of the performance, she at least didn’t have to perform another solo while thinking about her response.’ Among the first to congratulate the . couple after the proposal was Tony Hall, then chief executive of the . Royal Opera House and now Director- General of the BBC. They are one of five couples in the company getting married this year, featured in the current edition of Conde Nast Brides magazine . He described the on-set proposal as ‘the most romantic performance the main stage has ever seen.’ Yesterday, the couple married at the Roman Baths in Bath where Miss Cope’s stonemason grandfather had worked on the building’s restoration in the 1970s. Now both aged 30, they first met two decades ago after finishing joint first in a children’s dancing competition. But it was not until they began training at the Royal Ballet School as teenagers that they began dating. Their performances in The Nutcracker – which has been staged at Covent Garden every Christmas for 30 years – was described by one  captivated critic as having ‘a curving, almost delirious freedom in the upper body’. Leanne has played numerous roles in the Royal Ballet and has built a particularly strong relationship with Artist In Residence Liam Scarlett, who has described her as having ‘a presence on stage like no other’. Paul has a similarly impressive repertoire, with roles as varied  as Kolia in Chopin’s A Month In  The Country, Puck in The Dream ballet and Puss-in-Boots in  Sleeping Beauty. The four other ballerina brides walking down the aisle this year are Itziar Mendizabal, Nathalie Harrison, Hayley Forskitt and Sabina Westcombe. Miss Forskitt is marrying another Royal Ballet dancer, Brian Maloney. All five women are featured in a photoshoot for the current edition of Conde Nast Brides magazine.","Paul Kay has to hand Leanne Cope a note in their duet every night .

"It's no secret that when recent high school graduates head off to celebrate Schoolies week all they want to do is let loose. They're drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, passing out, getting naked, running wild on the streets and documenting it all on social media. But some of the teenagers living it up seem to be making drunken decisions that they will have to carry with them for the rest of their lives. Partygoers are getting inked as a permanent reminder of their celebrations, as tattoo parlours on the Gold Coast reveal they have been flooded with customers in the past few days. One extreme teen even went as far as to take the homemade option, carving the word SCHOOLIES into the skin on his stomach with a sharp implement. Scroll down for video .

'One guy asked to get it tattooed on his ass cheek,' Rob Domerelli told Courier Mail. Another nearby parlour - Custom Iron - said they had a group of men front the shop who asked for batman tattoos. Their reasoning: 'They told me they were getting it because they wanted to fight crime', manager Lindsay Hall told the website.

'Thirteen schoolies were arrested overnight on 16 charges for mainly public nuisance and street related offences with police pleased with the overall crowd behavior at the Surfers Paradise schoolies celebrations,' Queensland Police said in a statement. 'Of the 13 male schoolies arrested eight were for drug offences relating to cannabis and ecstasy.' The statement also revealed: '80 schoolies given liquor infringement notices for drinking in a public place' while 12 more were given to non-schoolies for the same reason.

"Thousands of female engineers will be trained up as part of a 'national mission' to get Britain building again, Ed Miliband announced today. The Labour leader said it was a 'national embarrassment' that just one in 25 engineers were women. He pledged to ensure an extra 400,000 engineers were trained up by 2020 - with a Labour source promising a 'significant increase' in the proportion of women. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband was given a tour of the Tottenham Court Road Crossrail site in London today . Mr Miliband said the engineers were needed to meet a shortfall in the number of skilled workers in the economy. He announced his plan during a visit to the Crossrail construction site in central London, which he said was an 'inspiring' project which should encourage the next generation of engineers. After another bruising period for his leadership, with the departure of Emily Thornberry from his shadow cabinet following her controversial tweeted image of a house flying three St George flags with a white van parked outside, Mr Miliband sought to shift the focus to his plans to rebalance the economy. After donning a hard hat and high-visibility safety gear for a tour of the works near Tottenham Court Road station, the Labour leader said: 'I think this is an inspiring place to be. 'Our country faces a shortage of 400,000 skilled engineers if we don't act. That's why it's the mission of the next Labour government to put that right. 'It's the way we will create good jobs at decent wages and it's also the way that we are going to create a recovery that doesn't just work for a few people at the top but actually works for working people.' Mr Miliband said Britain was facing a shortfall of some 400,000 engineers by 2020 if there was not a major recruitment drive . The Labour leader said the Government had failed to act to 'get the skilled engineers we need' to stop British industry being reliant on foreign workers . Mr Miliband acknowledged that the problem had existed for a number of years. 'Over a long period we haven't taken the action necessary to get the skilled engineers we need,' he said. 'That's about inspiring our young people in schools and colleges and creating new gold-standard technical qualifications for them in engineering. 'And it's about apprenticeships for the next generation. It's about saying to companies 'if you want a major government contract you must provide apprenticeships, if you bring in a skilled worker from outside the European Union you must also provide apprenticeships for the next generation'. 'It's that kind of national mission, of government and business together, that will create the skilled jobs and the skilled engineers we need.' Writing on Facebook he said there was a choice between 'two different directions' for the country. One was through the creation of skilled workers, such as those working on the major transport project in London, while the other involved 'cowboy recruitment agencies, operating in the shadows of the economy, exploiting workers, undercutting wages and undermining conditions'. He said: 'Only a Labour government will have the values, approach and ideas to turn the economy we have with low wage, low-skilled jobs into the economy we need, with high-skilled, high wage jobs.' Mr Miliband's pledge to boost female engineering comes after another tough week following the sacking of Labour MP Emily Thornberry . Mr Miliband said the UK had to 're-establish our historic reputation as a world leader in technology and manufacturing'. Labour said industry estimates were that an extra 780,000 more engineers would be needed between now and 2020, but current projections were for only around half of that number to be trained, leaving a shortfall of some 400,000. Mr Miliband said: 'This is not just a shortage of the traditional civil, mechanical and electrical engineers, but also in information technology, green energy, and life sciences where many of the jobs of the future will be created. 'And we need to ensure Britain does not waste the talents of any our young people, be they men or women. 'It should be matter of national embarrassment that the UK has the lowest proportion of female engineering professionals of anywhere in Europe.' In 2013, just 14% of engineering graduates were women, and females made up only 4% of all professionally-registered engineers. Mr Miliband said: 'We will work with schools to ensure more young people, girls as well as boys, do Stem subjects - Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths - to nurture this new generation. 'We will work with young people themselves, encouraging and inspiring them at every stage, with a clear vocational route through education into an engineering career that is desperately needed now. 'And we will work with industry to put employers in charge of the money for training young people so that as many school-leavers go into a high quality apprenticeship as currently go to university. 'This is the kind of future we can build together, doubling the rate of engineers being trained here by 2020 rather than importing them from abroad or leaving businesses without the skills they need to succeed.' As well as encouraging engineers, Mr Miliband said Labour would not tolerate a 'world of work that is becoming more brutal because of the way some rogue employment agencies have been allowed to operate'. He said: 'We will close the legal loophole which allows some to undercut the wages of permanent staff. 'We will stop them from recruiting exclusively from abroad. 'And we will serve notice on the rogue agencies that they must clean up their act.' He said Labour consult on measures including a licensing system to ensure agencies comply with basic standards .","Labour leader said number of women engineers a 'national embarrassment'

"First year nursing students at Flinders University in Adelaide are outraged after being forced to resit a compulsory subject that's been described as a scam. The three week introductory course, Nursing Profession and Independent Learning or NURS1001, requires nursing students to score 100 per cent in all 25 quizzes in order to pass. Questions include the cost of printing at the university's library and the title of a student council magazine. Samantha Rose Jones, 20, questioned the relevance of such trivial questions in a recent post online and it seems as though she doesn't stand alone. First year nursing students at Flinders University in Adelaide are outraged after being forced to resit a compulsory subject that's been described as a scam . 'I feel let down and disappointed by Flinders Univesity,' she told MailOnline. Ms Jones, who's originally from NSW and achieved top of the state in the Higher School Certificate human services - assistant in nursing exam in 2012, described the unrealistic standards of the topic as 'a form of academic bullying'. 'I don't understand why the nursing students from our uni have a compulsory topic like this when students doing other degrees don't have to do it,' she said. Samantha Rose Jones, 20, questioned the relevance of such trivial questions in a recent post online and it seems as though she doesn't stand alone . 'To me it sounds like a great way to make easy money. It seems like a scam and a way of exploiting students.' Ms Jones was one of the students who failed the topic which commenced in March. 'I didn't get 100 per cent in the passport quiz. I got 97.22 per cent,' she said. 'I didn't know exactly where to get help. I emailed my tutor for help with answering these questions since I had almost used up my 5 attempts. Her vague response of ""perhaps you are ticking too many boxes?"" didn't help me, so I failed the questions about where to get help after trying to get help.' Ms Jones said students who fail NURS1001 are offered a supplementary quiz, which contains questions from all of the quizzes. 'In failing that, students are required to enroll in winter school at a cost of $750 for domestic students and $2800 for internationals,' she said. After Ms Jones disputed the fairness of her grading for nearly two months, her course co-ordinator Jan Thompson finally agreed to regrade her with a pass. But others haven't been so lucky. Ms Jones said many of her classmates who failed the topic are being forced to enroll in winter school to resit the topic. She's further angered at the fact that Ms Thompson advised her that she will not be making changes to the topic, despite numerous complaints from students who have since sent emails to the Dean of Nursing to fight their grade.

Students who fail must resit the topic for an extra $750 at winter school in order to move onto their next semester of studies . However another first year nursing student, who anonymously contacted MailOnline, believes the whole ordeal has been 'blown out of proportion'. 'I don't agree with the cost of the topic but it was designed to make it very easy to pass for everyone,' the student said. 'I really don't think it's much of an issue and it really isn't that hard to answer the questions correctly.' The student also said the introductory topic also helped newcomers like himself the opportunity create new friendships. Although Ms Jones agreed that some parts of NURS1001 was vital for her learning - including lab safety and mathematics - she argued that learning about learning about commas and full stops was 'total rubbish'.

"This was the scene of carnage when methane from a giant cesspit in China exploded, destroying buildings and showering an area the size of a football pitch in human waste. Fifteen people were injured when the tank erupted in a fireball at the heart of a residential neighbourhood in Zhangjiajie city, in the central province of Hunan. Witnesses fled in panic as foul-smelling excrement rained down from the sky in the moments that followed the blast, smashing windows and sullying homes. Carnage: This was the scene of carnage when methane from a huge cesspit in China exploded, destroying a building and showering an area the size of a football field in human waste . Extreme excrement: Witnesses fled in panic as foul-smelling excrement rained down from the sky in the moments that followed the blast, smashing windows and sullying homes . Injuries: Fifteen people were injured when the tank erupted in a fireball in the heart of a residential neighbourhood in the city of Zhangjiajie, in the central province of Hunan . The eruption, which happened at 5pm on November 22, was sparked when local man Ding Hao, 49, tried to dispose of some rubbish by burning it in the courtyard of his home. A spark from the fire is believed to have drifted into the stinking sump, igniting the methane trapped within. Police spokesman Dewei Hsiao said: 'There appears to have been a build-up of methane from the waste pit which was filled with excrement from the surrounding residential buildings. A spark from the fire seems to have ignited this, causing a massive explosion.' Don't mind the stench: Rescue workers dig through the rubble, without face masks, which was covered in yellow waste from the tank . Bright spark: The incident began when local man Ding Hao, 49, decided to get rid of some rubbish by burning it in the courtyard of his home . Catch light: A spark from the fire is believed to have drifted into the sump, igniting the methane trapped within . The ensuing blast not only knocked down the building located above the cesspit, but also severely damaged other buildings in a wide area around the property. The police spokesman said that it appeared the cesspit had not been properly ventilated to prevent a build-up of methane, and it had also not been emptied for some time. He said it was lucky that nobody was killed by the explosion, which happened during the day when most residents were at work and the building was not inhabited. Most of those injured were people in nearby properties and pedestrians. Damage: The ensuing blast not only knocked down the building located above the cesspit, but also severely damaged other buildings in a wide area around the property . Poor standards: Although properties are usually connected to the public sewerage network, China's urban infrastructure has often been hastily built with little regard for basic standards . Shoddy: The builders of this property had apparently not wanted to wait for the sewer network to be extended to the area .

"A classmate of the grandson of Texas multimillionaire T. Boone Pickens has been sentenced to 10 years’ probation as part of a plea deal for giving the 21-year-old student the heroin that claimed his life. Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, 23, pleaded guilty on Monday to delivery of a controlled substance in the January 2013 death of Ty Pickens, according to  Tarrant County prosecutors. Rodriguez injected the drug into 21-year-old Pickens' arm, causing his death, prosecutors said. He will serve four months in jail as part of the agreement at the Texas court. Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, 23, (left) pleaded guilty on Monday to delivery of a controlled substance in the January 2013 death of Ty Pickens (right), the grandson of T. Boone Pickens . Prosecutor Kevin Roussea told Dallas News in a statement: 'This agreement was reached after considering all the facts and consulting with the family. No outcome can give them back their son, but hopefully with this plea, they can at least begin to heal.' Rodriguez was facing counts of tampering with evidence and manslaughter but these were dismissed as part of a plea deal. Ty's father, Thomas Boone Pickens III, is the industrialist's youngest son. T. Boone Pickens started his career at Phillips Petroleum before founding Mesa Petroleum in 1956. In April 2013, the Tarrant County Medical Examiner ruled Thomas Boone Pickens IV or Ty, as he was known, died of acute heroin intoxication. Another student allegedly found the grandson of the wealthy oil and gas titan at Rodriguez's off-campus apartment on the morning of January 29, 2013. The unidentified student said he wouldn't wake up and that he had probably been dead for several hours. It was later revealed that Rodriguez's cousin drove an unconscious Pickens to Baylor All Saints Hospital. Pickens was a junior at Texas Christian University where he was majoring in strategic communications.

Ty's grandfather, who has five children and 12 grandchildren, lives in an opulent mansion in the exclusive suburb of Preston Hollow, Dallas where neighbors include former president George W. Bush, many of the Dallas Cowboys and George Michael. Homes can cost as much as $40 million. The wealthy industrialist, who is worth an estimated $950 million, also owns the Mesa Vista, a property worth around $35million set in 68,000 acres in Roberts County, Texas. The multimillionaire has his own Gulfstream jet which he parks at his private airport in Pampa, Texas and fuels up to take him to Oklahoma State football games. He has also been actively involved in national politics. He was one of the leading opponents against Democrat Sen. John Kerry's bid to unseat President George W. Bush from the White House in 2004. Now, after a career in the oil industry, he champions a plan to get America to use fewer fossil fuels by promoting alternative energy such as wind, solar and natural gas. He plans to build the world's largest wind farm in Texas to champion his idea.

"The sons and daughters of the late founder of the Benihana restaurant chain are trying to stop their father's widow from wasting their $50million inheritance. The six children of Hiroaki 'Rocky' Aoki assumed legal control of their father's sizable estate earlier this year after a long, bitter legal battle, but are still at the whims of its trustee, stepmom Keiko. Page Six reports the kids, including DJ Steven Aoki - a millionaire in his own right - and model Devon Aoki, have no access to the money until each turns 45. Steven and Devon are in their 30s. Family feud: The sons and daughters of Rocky Aoki, including model Devon Aoki and DJ Steven Aoki (pictured together both left and right) are trying to stop their father's widow from wasting their $50million inheritance . On the red carpet: Benihana founder Rocky Aoki and his wife Keiko pictured together at a gala dinner in New York in 2006 . The money is currently in a stock-holding trust invested in Benihana of Tokyo and operated by Keiko. Benihana of Tokyo, which operates restaurants overseas and in Hawaii, has been the benefactor of some questionable gimmicks, according to a suit filed in the Manhattan Surrogate's Court. Funds have gone to pay to fly around the Beni Girls, a duo of hip-hop dancers performs in Benihana chef attire at restaurants and during promotional events, the suit claims. Court documents called it an 'odd attempt to entertain guests.' Keiko also introduced a Japanese-style burger called the Beni Burger at Honolulu Benihana that drew a lawsuit from Benihana Inc, a company outside the family that currents owns the license. The children's stepmother reportedly initiated three 'frivolous' lawsuits of her own against Benihana Inc, two of which she already lost. But even during Aoki's lifetime, his relationship with his children was tempestuous - and litigious - with the elder restaurateur initiating his own lawsuit against his four other children in 2006. Stars: Model Devon Aoki (left) and DJ Steven Aoki (right) were not as close to their father as other siblings and were not parties to the 2006 suit that Aoki leveled against his children for trying to 'wrest control' of Benihana . Model behavior: Devon, 32, shot to fame as a model  in the 1990s and went on to score several huge campaigns including for Chanel (pictured) and Versace among others . 'I want to help my kids, but I want my children to crawl, to walk, then run on their own,' Aoki told New York Magazine at the time, explaining his decision to rewrite his will to give Keiko control over how to dispense his estate after his death. Aoki was worried over how his heirs were trying 'wrest control' over his business, and was bitter over how they had let Benihana of Tokyo lose its controlling interest in Benihana Inc. Steven and Devon had, at the time, reportedly avoided their father's wrath, not being very close to the patriarch. The lawsuit was still unsettled at the time of Aoki's death in 2008 at the age of 69 and taken up by Keiko. Restaurateur: Aoki founded the Benihana chain, which popularized the teppanyaki style of restaurant service in the United States, in 1964 . Benihana - founded in New York and with headquarters in Florida - now owns or franchises 116 Japanese restaurants around the world .","The founder of Benihana, Hiroaki 'Rocky' Aoki died in 2008 .

"A driver has been fined after leaving his car unattended – so he could collect a parking permit. James Maloney stopped outside his parents’ home in Liverpool and went inside to pick up their visitors’ permit. But when the 34-year-old returned moments later, he found a ticket on his windscreen – which showed an ‘observation period’ of just 12 seconds. James Maloney, above, stopped outside his parents’ home and went inside to pick up their visitors’ permit . He said: ‘Quite how someone is supposed to display a permit without getting out of their car to get it from the householder is beyond me.’ The photographer, who received the fine on September 18, added: ‘I imagine that Usain Bolt would have trouble getting in and out of the house quick enough to display a valid permit within 12 seconds.’ A spokesman for Liverpool Council said that residents have in the past asked for ‘more robust’ policing of the area, and ‘contraventions are penalised to reflect this’. He added that the ‘observation period’ referred to the time taken for a warden to print the notice, and that officers were in the street for ten minutes. The council said any motorist could appeal against the decision. Mr Maloney said: 'The fine doesn't bother me. It's more the principle. 'I am more than happy to donate the full amount of the fine to a charity of Mayor Joe Anderson's choice if the council decides to exercise a bit of common sense on this occasion.' He returned to find this ticket on his windscreen – which showed an ‘observation period’ of just 12 seconds .","James Maloney went inside to pick up his parents visitors' parking permit .

"Racism has been condoned at the University of Alabama as all-white sororities win their fight to ban black students from applying. A group of 27 student senators blocked a bill to fully integrate fraternities at the establishment from reaching a public vote, with just five in favour, and two abstentions. It has sparked outrage as critics blast the 'backwards' state of student societies more than half a century after the university first granted black students entry. Uproar: Student senators at the University of Alabama have been blasted for voting 27 to five, with two abstentions, against racial integration within fraternities . The conflict emerged after the student newspaper Crimson White published an article last year reporting all-white groups had accepted two black applicants. The paper reported that Pan-hellenic society members blamed their alumni for 'stepping in' despite their attempts to back the student's application. Since 1963, only one black student had been permitted entry into the Greek system, so-called because each 'frat' is named after a letter of the Greek alphabet. Another mixed race student was granted a place, but it is claimed they did not reveal their race until they had been accepted. Tabling a motion to integrate students in sororities last September, university president Judy Bonner said: 'I am confident that we will achieve our objective of a Greek system that is inclusive, accessible and welcoming to students of all races and ethnicities. 'We will not tolerate anything less.' Her words came after hundreds of students turned out for a protest on the 50th anniversary of black students being admitted to the establishment, calling for change. The resolution was intended to wipe clean the university's reputation for segregation more than half a century after the first black students were admitted . And in an initial bid to encourage diversity, Ms Bonner ruled that sororities could be bigger, and accept students at any time of year, as opposed to the previously strict admissions process. However, Friday's ruling has caused a major set-back in the fight to stamp out racism. The resolution had proposed 'the complete integration of all Greek letter fraternities and sororities at the University of Alabama, with respect to social diversity among its membership'. Though it would not have had the power to change the Greek system's policy, the amendment was billed as a statement that the student body supports integration. It was also an attempt to clean the university's 'stigmatisation' in the media over the saga. Last year, students held a rally fighting for integration that sparked a resolution to be tabled last week, but it failed to pass . But the measure will now have to be re-written and re-tabled next year if it is to pass. Speaking after the debate, Katie Smith, lead sponsor of the resolution, told the Crimson White: 'I think that this reflects our SGA poorly but also accurately. I am not surprised. I don't believe that I put anyone in a catch-22. They chose to vote on it and they chose to vote it down.'

"On Earth we've colonised deserts, forests, mountains and many other locations, but we're yet to truly live on our planet's most abundant locale, namely oceans, which cover 71 per cent of the surface. That could all be set to change though as one company has unveiled designs for floating cities that could operate both on the surface and underwater. Using a number of advanced technologies, the enormous spheres could house 5,000 people and also perform research on the seabed. Scroll down for video . This artist impression image released from Japan's construction company Shimizu Corporation on shows a modern-day Atlantis, a sphere 1,600 feet (500 metres) in diameter that houses hotels, residential spaces and commercial complexes . The futuristic concepts were drawn up by the Shimizu Corporation in Tokyo, in partnership with Tokyo University and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (Jamstec). Each vast globe would float at the surface of the sea, but could be submerged in bad weather, down the centre of a gigantic spiral structure that plunges to depths of up 2.5 miles (4km). The spiral would form a path nine miles (15km) to a building on the ocean floor, which could serve as a resource development factory that could collect rare metals and rare earths. Their design is not just for one but for several vast globes known as Ocean Spirals dotted over the ocean that could survive extreme weather events like earthquakes, which are fairly common in Japan. Shimizu says that micro organisms called 'methanogens' could be used to convert carbon dioxide captured at the surface into methane. The wide difference in water temperatures and pressures between the top and bottom of the ocean, meanwhile, could be used to generate power. Each Ocean Spiral would cost about $25 billion and, if construction begins soon, the first could apparently be built by 2030. Each vast globe would float at the surface of the sea, but could be submerged in bad weather, down the centre of a gigantic spiral structure that plunges to depths of up 2.5 miles (4km) People could live and work in the city, or come and visit for a location and view some of the amazing marine life outside . During bad weather the spheres would be submerged underwater. The design of each globe is such that they are watertight, so the entire object can be submerged, or part of it can be exposed out of the ocean . To build the massive structures, the company intends to use industrial-sized 3D printers, with resin being used instead of other materials such as concrete. Each globe would be 1,600 feet (500 metres) in diameter and would have on board hotels, residential areas and commercial spaces. The design of each globe is such that they are watertight, so the entire object can be submerged, or part of it can remain exposed out of the ocean. The spirals would extend about 1.8 to 2.5 (3 or 4km) to the ocean floor. At the bottom could be a research station that would be used to produce power, in addition to mining the seabed. Supplies could also be delivered to the station via undersea docking facilities. Small spheres would travel up and down the spiral to transport cargo to and from the research station at the bottom. On the surface boats can dock with the sphere, allowing residents and visitors to come and go as they please . The spiral would form a path nine miles (15km) to a building on the ocean floor, which could serve as a resource development factory that could collect rare metals and rare earths . The difference in water temperatures and pressures between the top and bottom of the ocean could be used to generate power . 'The company in cooperation with many organisations has spent two years to design the project working with technologies we think will be plausible in the future,' said a Shimizu spokesman. It is one of several futuristic projects unveiled by the company, which also includes a floating metropolis and solar power ring around the moon. In 2012, another Japanese construction firm, Obayashi Corp, claimed it could execute an out-of-this-world plan to put tourists in space within 40 years by building an elevator that stretches a quarter of the way to the moon. Obayashi claimed it could use carbon nanotube technology, which is more than 20 times stronger than steel, to build a lift shaft 60,000 miles (96,000km) above Earth.","Tokyo-based construction firm Shimizu Corporation has revealed concepts for futuristic cities .

"Whether prompted by a desire to keep up with those pert Middleton sisters or simply by a resurgence in energy as her children move out of the sleepless phase of infancy, Sophie Wessex has sharpened up her act. Almost beyond recognition. The attention-grabbing, skin-tight electric blue number by fashion’s master of flattery, Roland Mouret, that she wore to last Sunday’s Easter Service at St George’s Chapel showed off her Pilates-honed figure and was particularly well-suited to her new role as patron of the London College of Fashion. Royal favourite: Sophie, Countess of Wessex (right) has her hat readjusted by the Queen . Days ago, in Robert Hardman’s documentary Our Queen, she gave her first television interview since her wedding. The programme makers and the viewers — most of whom had never heard her voice — were impressed by her self-deprecating, warm, fluid manner. Her accent was refreshingly unaffected, neither plummy nor estuary. As she jokingly spoke of her terror of Buckingham Palace banquets, she said she had been copying the Queen’s manner, seeking to emulate her elegant style and the way she never rushes when talking to people. Whatever Sophie has been striving to perfect — that polish in both appearance and attitude — it seems to be working. Honed: Sophie Wessex on Easter Sunday in skin tight Roland Mouret at St George's Chapel in Windson . Last month, the organisers of a fundraising dinner in aid of the National Autistic Society were stunned when she spoke for 20 minutes, knowledgeably and movingly on the subject, rather than uttering the usual brief platitudes favoured by most royals, including Kate. It was astonishing and financially effective, said a trustee, photographer John Swannell. Apparently, she always does her homework. No wonder bright-eyed Sophie is a great favourite of the Queen. They share an interest in horses and military history, sometimes staying up late at Windsor to discuss what they have read. The Queen respects her work ethic, the effort she puts into her engagements, and bringing up her children. She alone has managed to stay married to one of the Queen’s children, and that child, Edward, as the baby, carries special status with his mother. There has been speculation that Sophie might feel threatened by the Queen’s fondness for the Duchess of Cambridge, with whom the Monarch has undertaken a few joint engagements to introduce her into her role. She would never do joint engagements with Sophie. But the Duchess’s gravitational pull is towards her mother, Carole, in Berkshire, and Charles at Highgrove. While the Queen now enjoys good relations with Camilla, that bond will never be as straightforward as the one she has with Sophie, whose mother died in 2005. Sophie has the advantage of proximity as the Wessex pile, Bagshot Park, lies 11 miles from Windsor Castle. As her children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn, are only nine and five, these relationships are as near as the Queen can get to enjoying a nuclear family. They ride together in Windsor Great Park and drink cups of tea by the fire almost every weekend. The Queen always chooses Sophie to sit next to her on the way to Church on Christmas Day. She gave Sophie the choice of furniture and pictures from her own collection when she revamped ten bedrooms at Bagshot, so there is now a tartan Balmoral room and another with a naval theme. The Queen has helped teach Sophie’s children to ride, and has advised her on the rehabilitation of her image. After all, a few years ago it certainly didn’t look as though Sophie would become the Monarch’s pet or such a sought-after charity patron, let alone a fashion plate. Stylish: Sophie, Countess of Wessex coming out of her shell, looking confident at a wedding in 2011 . She was a PR girl who featured in some toe-curling snaps of Chris Tarrant pulling up her top when she worked at Capital Radio. She met Edward playing a publicity game of ‘real’ tennis, and eyebrows were raised when they married because there had been talk he wasn’t the marrying kind. He designed her a strange necklace for a wedding present, and the bridesmaids and pages seemed to be in fancy dress as the last of the Plantagenets. Sophie declared her desire to carry on working at RJH, the PR company she had set up with her partner Murray Harkin. Then, in 2001, disaster struck. Sophie (and her partner) was recorded by the News Of The World’s notorious ‘fake sheikh’ being indiscreet about other royals and offering to use those royal connections for clients. She was so traumatised, one friend says, that she talked about leaving the country in tearful despair, believing she would be relegated to daughter-in-law non grata. The avowed career girl was forced to put aside her fantasy of being an entrepreneur as well as a royal. Backed up and counselled by the Queen, she adopted a lower register of unglamorous, low-profile public engagements with the aim of starting a family. The royal wives: Sophie, Countess of Wessex, left, with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, right, last year . But that didn’t go smoothly either. In 2001, she suffered a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy, followed by months of IVF. Daughter Louise was born in 2003 several weeks early by emergency Caesarean, and it was reported at one point Edward was told he might have to choose between the survival of mother or child. But both flourished, although Louise had exotropia, a serious eye condition, which triggered her mother’s interest in children with developmental difficulties. Then, happily, a son arrived in 2007. By now, RJH had collapsed owing several creditors lots of money, though Sophie had scaled back her involvement years before. And she had made a decision; having been through such a struggle to have children, she would be a very hands-on mother. No surprise that many of her charities involve children’s causes, and the enthusiasm she shows when meeting them is obviously genuine. She is said by one royal observer to have ‘an almost Diana-like effect on people, a natural warmth and sweetness, whereas Edward can be so awkward’. Edward apparently retains an antipathy to the media although Sophie, arguably a far greater victim of its sting than he ever was, displays a likeable breeziness and lack of resentment in her attitude. Both of the couple’s children are now at a private prep school. The Wessexes have a nanny among other staff (a housekeeper, two maids and a gardener as well as office personnel) but early on agreed they would rarely go away at the same time. Sophie often does the school run herself. Last year, the Wessexes carried out two foreign tours for the Diamond Jubilee, to Gibraltar — a politically sensitive mission given Spain’s antipathy, which the Queen tellingly trusted them to carry off — and the Caribbean. Though that may sound like nice work, it was apparently far from a pool and cocktails job, consisting of two weeks of back-to-back engagements while away from their children. New to the family: Sophie marrying Prince Edward at St. Georges's Chapel in Windsor Castle in 1999 . As well as Pilates classes with mothers from her children’s school, sessions with a personal fitness trainer, running, riding and tennis keep Sophie fit. She started displaying the results in a startlingly revamped wardrobe — her confidence obviously went through the roof — about two years ago. In her mid-40s she acquired a taste for high fashion. She started sporting one-shouldered evening gowns, and daring figure-hugging evening dresses such as the one she wore to the Paralympic Ball last summer. Her teeth got whiter, her skin smoother, her hair blonder and more coiffed. Hello! readers voted her outfit — not Kate’s — the most attractive at Zara Phillips’ wedding. Her hats seemed to get bigger and more ‘look-at-me’. If she was worried the Middleton sisters were about to overshadow her, she certainly did something about it. She made sure the photographers couldn’t ignore her. The fact she was a mother-of-two, energetic in her charity works and had been learning from the Queen’s unhurried style made her look the model royal. And as we can see from her blue suit and endearing manner this week, she’s not as bland as we all feared, either. Of course, such rehabilitations never go as smoothly as one would like. Even in recent months, Sophie has had the odd hiccup. There was a furore over her acceptance of some dazzling suites of jewellery from the despotic state of Bahrain; the Queen backed her in keeping them and it all fizzled out (presumably she felt that if she had refused, there would have been a diplomatic incident). Old friends: Sophie Wessex and the Queen back in 2001 . Even friends admit she has a temper — she was photographed last year shouting at her protection officer in the street for reasons unknown — and opinions are divided about whether she is really incredibly ‘down to earth’ and people-friendly, as most people say, or whether she can be a trifle grand when she thinks she can get away with it. But surely it’s a good thing she seems to enjoy her royal status, even though friends are staggered by her life now. ‘She hated the idea of spending her life shaking hands and ribbon cutting. She was a bright, ambitious young girl who set up her PR business. I am astonished at the life she lives today,’ says one. Unofficially, Edward and Sophie have the Ruritanian role of attending all the weddings of crowned heads of Europe, representing the Queen for a new generation. It’s not all glamour though: can you imagine any other royal visiting the Ginsters factory as Sophie did last month, and actually putting on the workers’ overalls and hairnet? The Queen has rewritten the rules so when she and Prince Philip die, Edward, rather than Charles, will become Duke of Edinburgh. With that in mind, Edward has picked up the most famous of his father’s duties, which is the Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme, so that it will last into another generation. As the Queen knows, the future Duchess of Edinburgh will surely be his greatest asset.","The Queen has advised Sophie Wessex on the rehabilitation of her image .

"Pay packets for women in the workforce are 25 percent less than their male counterparts as it's revealed a third of companies have no females in key management roles. The largest pay gaps between men and women is in the financial and insurance sectors where the disparity in total remuneration rises to 36 percent. The findings were released on Tuesday as part of a comprehensive gender data report from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). Pay packets for women in the workforce are 25 percent less than their male counterparts as it's revealed a third of companies have no females in key management roles . The report shows full-time working women earn a base salary that is 19.9 percent less than full-time working men. But when total remuneration, including discretionary pay like bonuses, allowances and overtime, is taken into account the pay gap rises to 24.7 percent less than men. The data collected from 11,000 Australian employers showed the pay gap between men and women was lowest in the education and training sector at 9.6 percent. 'This data shows that women don't have the same opportunities as men to boost their earnings with discretionary pay,' WGEA's director Helen Conway said. The largest pay gaps between men and women is in the financial and insurance sectors where the disparity in total remuneration rises to 36 percent . 'Unfortunately, employers are not doing enough to address this issue. The data shows less than one in four employers has done a gender remuneration gap analysis to check for potential pay equity issues.' While the report says traditionally male-dominated industries such as mining and energy are doing a better job  at promoting women into management positions, most companies are failing to maximise the potential of highly educated women. The data found women comprise close to 40 per cent of junior management, 26.1 per cent of key management but only 17.3 of chief executive officers. The data found women comprise close to 40 per cent of junior management, 26.1 per cent of key management but only 17.3 of chief executive officers, including outgoing Westpac CEO Gail Kelly . 'Women face clearly defined structural and cultural barriers in the workplace that make it harder for them to rise up the management ranks,' Ms Conway said. Liberal senator Michaelia Cash, who assists the prime minister on women's issues, said the data showed there was much room for improvement. She said increasing female participation in the workforce was essential to boosting Australia's productivity and economic growth.

"‘X-wing’ spaceships instantly evoke scenes from Star Wars, but Elon Musk has just shown off real, functioning rocket fins in the iconic configuration. The billionaire entrepreneur is testing 'hypersonic grid fins' that are designed to help control SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket as it re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere. He has also showcased ‘drone ships’ that could one day be used as offshore landing pads for the reusable spacecraft. The CEO of SpaceX revealed the features on Twitter, adding that testing for both futuristic technologies is currently underway. The latest version of SpaceX’s reusable rocket sports a set of four fins that can be independently adjusted. ‘Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for ""X-wing"" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll,’ Mr Musk tweeted. The X-shaped spacecraft in the Star Wars films were incredible maneuverable, allowing pilots such as Luke Skywalker to outclass the most skillful Imperial pilot. Mr Musk tweeted: ‘Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for ""x-wing"" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll'. The X-shaped spacecraft in the Star Wars films, called x-wings (pictured) were incredible maneuverable and allowed pilots of navigate the tightest of spaces . Elon Musk wants to use satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet. He said to be involved in developing cheap and small satellites with expert Greg Wyler, of WorldVu Satellites. The duo plan on launching 700 satellites which would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet. They would each weigh just 250lbs (113kg) - half the weight of the current lightest commercial offering. The duo is considering opening a factory in Florida or Colorado to build their creations for a cost of at least $1 billion (£600 million). Any satellites produced would likely be launched by Mr Musk’s firm SpaceX but there are many obstacles in the way. The fins on the Falcon rocket deploy after take-off to prevent unnecessary drag and work alongside thrusters to enable the rocket to position itself correctly to land vertically, Space Daily reported. The entrepreneur likely made the X-wing reference because of the shape the fins make when spread out in four separate directions, plus because of their manoeuvrability. They are similar to a set used on a test earlier this year, according to Mr Musk, who shared a video of that flight on the social network. He also revealed details about the platform the rocket could land on. Mr Musk is testing an ‘autonomous drone ship,’ that’s designed to be a safe platform for rockets to land on and refuel, away from densely populated cities. He claims that the ship can maintain its position within 10ft (three metres) in the stormiest of conditions. He tweeted: ‘Autonomous spaceport drone ship. Thrusters repurposed from deep sea oil rigs hold position within 3m even in a storm.’ As well as testing rocket fins and autonomous landing pads, Elon Musk (pictured) is said to be working on using an array of 1700 satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet .","Elon Musk has shown off real rocket fins with ‘x-wing’ configuration .

"Disgraced NFL player Aaron Hernandez was 'apparently high' before he allegedly executed his former friend, MailOnline can reveal today. Prosecutors plan to introduce evidence that includes security surveillance video taken at the gas . station where Hernandez bought a cigar and bubble gum twenty minutes . before he picked up Odin Lloyd. Lloyd, 27, a semi-professional football player, who would be found dead later that same . day in an industrial park close to the former football star's mansion in North Attleborough, Massachussetts. 'High': Hernandez is alleged to have been caught on surveillance camera dancing in the headlights of his car while 'apparently high' when he stopped at a gas station to buy a 'cigar and gum' before he picked up Lloyd . Investigative sources told MailOnline that Hernandez, pictured here with Snoop Dogg, was a heavy user of PCP, alcohol and hydroponic marijuana . 'He danced in his own headlights for so long the gas station attendant turned off the outside lights to get rid of him,' said a high-ranking law enforcement source. 'He was apparently high, or very much appeared to be.' Bristol County prosecutor Sam Sutter would not comment on specific video, but court records filed by investigators in the case state that video shows Hernandez stopped at the Blue Hill Express Service Station at 2.09 am on June 17 last year and purchased a 'cigar and Bubble Yum cotton candy flavored gum'. Investigative sources told MailOnline that Hernandez was a heavy user of PCP, alcohol and hydroponic marijuana. A manager at the Blue Hill Express Service Station who asked not to be identified confirmed the dancing video, and said all of the security footage had been turned over to investigators. Ernest Wallace, 41, is charged with being an accessory after the fact of murder in connection with Lloyd’s death. Wallace, a Bristol, Connecticut native, was living in Hernandez’s home, prosecutors said. Another man, Carlos Ortiz, is also charged as an accessory but is not expected to testify against Hernandez because his story has changed, investigators told MailOnline. Meanwhile, Hernandez has also been identified by prosecutors and in court documents as a suspect in another drive-by shooting in Boston that left two men dead and another wounded in July 2012. MailOnline has learned that then New England Patriots tight end has been identified . as the shooter both by his passenger in a rented SUV and the survivor of . the triple shooting, according to sources familiar with grand jury . testimony. Death and drugs: Odin Lloyd, 27, left, was found executed in an industrial park near Hernandez's mansion. Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, right, are both charged as accessories in the murder. Ortiz is not expected to testify against Hernandez because of his inconsistent story . Gimme gas: The station manager at the Blue Hill Express gas station, above, has told how he turned off the outside lights to get rid of Hernandez because he was allegedly dancing for so long . Suffolk County prosecutors have acknowledged there is a grand jury . inquiry into the July 2012 shooting after a car believed to have been . used in that drive-by was recovered. It was found in a Bristol, Connecticut, garage . owned by Hernandez’s uncle, according to a search warrant . affidavit filed in the case. According to sources, less than five minutes before the shots rang . out Hernandez was captured by a security . surveillance camera driving a gray SUV with Rhode Island license plates . out of a parking garage near the Boston nightclub Cure – the same club . where the shooting victims were partying earlier in the night. In the passenger . seat of the rented SUV was Alexander Bradley – who . was forced to testify in front of the grand jury after he was arrested . as a fugitive from justice. Bradley is the same man who filed a lawsuit . this year claiming Hernandez shot him in the face in Florida last . January and blew out his eye after they partied with friends at a strip . club. Bradley . testified that Hernandez was the gunman in the July 2012 Boston fatal . drive-by shooting, several sources said – a claim that was corroborated . by the sole survivor. Hernandez was also captured on security . cameras at the Cure nightclub arguing with the victims and a club . employee told investigators he saw the then-Patriots player carry a gun . into the establishment, according to court documents. Guns: Investigators are also working with ATF agents who have launched a federal probe into weapons found at Hernandez's home. He was captured holding a pistol on his own security cameras . 'The . witness stated that he didn’t know Hernandez from the Patriots but . recognized his face after his arrest in the Odin Lloyd case,'’ a . high-ranking law enforcement official told MailOnline. Separately, investigators are also working alongside ATF agents who have launched a federal probe into the weapons found at Hernandez’s home, several sources said. They added that one of those guns was the pistol Hernandez was captured holding on his own security cameras that emerged after his arrest for Lloyd's murder. At a status conference hearing . in open court last week, Bristol County prosecutors acknowledged there . was a separate investigation into Hernandez being conducted by a 'national agency'. Hernandez was arrested on June 26 and has been held without bail since. His fiancé and mother of his toddler daughter, Shayana Jenkins, has also been charged with perjury in the case. His cousin, Tanya Singleton, was also charged with obstruction of justice. Implicated: Alexander Bradley, who claims Hernandez blew out his eye, above, has allegedly testified to a grand jury that Hernandez was the gunman in a separate fatal drive-by in Boston in 2012 . Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley – who is investigating the Boston allegations – declined to comment on the startling new evidence against Hernandez evidence through his spokesman Jake Wark. 'We have no comment on the ongoing grand jury proceedings,' Wark said. Hernandez was in court last week, where a judge denied the prosecution’s request for official copies of jailhouse phone calls that they allege the former NFL star used to discuss murder in code.

"Rio-bocop: Military officers will carry weapons at the World Cup normally used to tackle terrorist threats . A crack squad of 400 specialist ‘Robocop’ style troops are preparing to greet England World Cup fans when they descend on Brazil next month. The men are part of the elite BOPE unit of military police who operate in Rio de Janeiro and are usually on 24-hour standby to deal with the threats from terrorists - but they will now also deal with football hooligans who step out of line. Carrying M16 and M4 carbine rifles with laser sights, Taurus PT92 pistols and fragmentation and stun grenades the squad have in the past also dealt with armed drug dealers who are known to operate from the city’s impoverished favelas. BOPE’s distinctive emblem is of a skull impaled with a knife in front of two golden guns and the unit was first formed in January 1978. The Batalhao de Operacoes Policias Especias – or Special Police Operation Battalion – also uses a special fleet of vehicles called with one called the ‘Peacemaker’ and another ‘The Big Skull’ as they carry out their role in both the streets and the slums. During the World Cup some 4,000 regular police office will be on patrol and they will be joined by a further 1,500 military officers during the month long tournament. Meanwhile, travelling fans are being warned that drunken behaviour will not be tolerated and visitors are also being warned to be alert in case of ‘Express’ kidnappings. The method sees a victim – sometimes having got into a bogus or rogue taxi - taken to an ATM to withdraw cash on a daily basis. Victims are held for around 72 hours and are sometimes beaten during the ordeal before finally being freed after four or five days. Yesterday Lieutenant Colonel Joao . Soares Busnello, who once was a member of BOPE, warned England fans not . to drink heavily when visiting the country as he said: . ‘If a hooligans drink a lot of . calpirinhas – our national cocktail – and does something crazy BOPE are . the ones that will deal with him. ‘BOPE will also be called if someone is taken hostage or there is a terrorist act or a political or religious riot.’ Out in force: Soldiers will provide security during the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro next month . Patrol: 4,000 regular police officers will be joined by a further 1,500 military offices during the tournament . Preparations: A soldier wears a chemical suit during the presentation of troops .

"An angry MP hit out at Tesco today after a senior boss gloated at the closing of five depots, with the loss of thousands of jobs. The supermarket giant’s distribution director Steve Strachota tweeted triumphantly that the closures - and opening of three new depots - showed 'awesome teamwork, courageous leadership and a bit of luck'. But MP Robert Halfon has slammed Tesco as callous for axing one of the depots in his constituency in Harlow, Essex - with the loss of more than 800 jobs. An angry MP hit out at Tesco today after distribution director Steve Strachota gloated at the closing of five depots, with the loss of thousands of jobs . The tweet, which was posted on Steve Strachota's (above) account, has now been deleted . He said: 'I find it sad that a company that I have had huge respect for seems to be so callous in their treatment of workers, many of whom have given more than 20 years of service to Tesco. 'I shall tell Tesco that given what has happened here in Harlow and the upset it has caused to many people, your senior managers appear to be wallowing in what they have done.' Mr Halfon has now tabled an Early Day Motion stating 'This House is disappointed at the treatment of Tesco distribution centre workers in Harlow and notes that Tesco’s UK and Ireland distribution director Steve Strachota tweeted: ""Five depots closing, three new ones ready to go. Awesome teamwork, courageous leadership and a bit of luck. #worldclass"". 'This has been seen by many Tesco workers in Harlow and their families, many of whom have given over 20 years' loyal service to Tesco and therefore the House urges Tesco to condemn this tweet and recognise the upset that this has caused to Harlow workers.' The tweet, which was posted on Mr Strachota's account a month ago, has now been deleted. A spokesman for Tesco said: 'The tweet was intended to acknowledge that difficult decisions had been taken in order to make significant changes to our distribution network. 'Steve has spoken to our colleagues at Harlow in person to explain this and they recognised that it should be seen in that context. 'Nonetheless, we sincerely apologise if the tweet caused any offence, and it has now been removed.' In February this year, Tesco announced it was shutting existing depots including those at Harlow, Weybridge (Surrey) and Chesterfield (Derbyshire) with the loss of 2,000 jobs but setting up new centres at Reading, Dagenham and Fenny Lock, in Milton Keynes, which the firm says will create 2,000 new jobs. Meanwhile, sites in Daventry (Northamptonshire) and Middlewich (Cheshire) are being relocated to Fenny Lock. The Harlow depot, about 30 miles north of London, is being shut as part of an upgrade of the company's delivery network. The depot (above) in Harlow, Essex, is being shut as part of an upgrade of the company's delivery network - with a loss of more than 800 jobs . A spokesman for Tesco said workers in Essex would be offered work at the new bases and that it hoped 'to keep as many people in jobs as possible'. Reading is 76 miles away from Harlow, while Dagenham is around 25 miles away. The news is a devastating blow to Harlow, where 9.9 per cent are unemployed, compared to the national average of 7.9 per cent. Harlow MP Robert Halfon (above) has slammed Tesco as callous for axing the depot in his constituency . One worker told local newspaper The Harlow Star: 'There are people who have worked at this depot for over 20 years. 'They're not going to uproot their families and move to Reading or Dagenham.' Last week, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith pledged to send a Government 'hit-team' to Harlow to support staff affected by the impending closure. He said his department would do 'all it could' to help workers who faced either redundancy or relocation to Tesco's new depot in Dagenham. 'I was very concerned to hear of the difficulties facing staff at the Tesco depot in Harlow,' Mr Duncan-Smith said. 'To that end, I will be asking the department to assign a ""hit-team"" to Harlow to find out more about how we can help. 'This will involve discussions with Tesco management and liaising with JobCentre Plus specialists to make sure staff are given all the help and support they need to find alternative work, as well as making sure that issues over disability allowances and terms and conditions are properly resolved before workers are relocated.'","Distribution director Steve Strachota described the news as 'a bit of luck'

"A council has removed posters advertising a circus following a complaint from a woman who is scared of clowns. Leighton Buzzard Town Hall Council said it took down the adverts after one complaint - in a town of 28,000 people. An unnamed female resident told the authority the posters were scaring her whenever she drove past them, explaining that she suffers from coulrophobia. A council has taken down posters advertising a circus after a complaint from someone who is afraid of clowns . The council removed all of the posters and told the circus not to come back to the town unless it uses promotional material without clowns on it. 'We take complaints on a case by case basis but this was a short-term, easily solvable problem,' said council operations officer Lisa Jarvis. 'The circus is on the park which is our responsibility and we are responsible to our residents, so something like that is in our gift to fix, so we fixed it.' Circus owner and ringmaster John Lawson said the decision was 'absolutely ridiculous' because the circus is only in town for a couple of days. 'What does she do when she drives past McDonalds, I wonder? It's victimisation,' he said. 'We . don't know who it is, but if we did, we'd gladly offer her tickets to . come and see... that our friendly clown is nothing to be scared of.' John Lawson (right), owner of the circus, may not be allowed back to Leighton Buzzard if he doesn't remove clowns from his promotional posters . The circus owner has invited the complainant to come along to the circus to see how friendly the clown is . He added: 'We don't know where this lady lives and we didn't put the posters there deliberately. 'Thousands of people pass is over the week, it seems daft to take it down for one person.' 'She could possibly take another route or we could maybe put up a separate board without a clown on it.' The circus performed its first show in the town on Thursday and will remain there until Sunday. It features a performance by Clumbsy the Clown. Owner Mr Lawson has described Leighton Buzzard Town Hall Council's decision as 'absolutely ridiculous' The circus came to Leighton Buzzard on Thursday and is due to leave on Sunday . Phobia expert and hypnotherapist Christine Black suggested the complainant and council may have gone about addressing the issue in the wrong way. 'The council have merely accommodated her fear,' she said. 'The lady is trying to manage her fear by controlling her environment but she needs to control the irrational fear.' The Joker, from the Batman films, is believed to have made coulrophobia more prevalent . Scientists generally agree that coulrophobia is a result of not knowing who lies behind the makeup, red nose and hair of a clown. According to Coulrophobia Facts, research has shown the fear of clowns has increased since the Steven Spielberg's 1990s' film, 'It', which depicts a murderous clown. The portrayal of the Joker in Batman films is also blamed. According to the site, the phobia, which can cause panic, breathing difficulty and nausea, does prevent some people from eating at McDonalds. Coulrophobia can affect both adults and children.","Decision made in Leighton Buzzard after one complaint in town of 28,000 .

"Strict: Mrs May warned an attack by extremists returning from Syria and Iraq was ‘highly likely’ Universities will have to ban hate preachers from speaking on campus under a crackdown unveiled yesterday by Theresa May. Schools, colleges, prisons and councils will also be ordered to put in place anti-extremism policies to stop vulnerable youngsters being exposed to Islamist fanatics, the Home Secretary said. The draconian powers are part of a sweeping package of measures to tackle the growing threat of jihadists determined to bring bloodshed to our streets. In a keynote speech, Mrs May said the threat to Britain from fanatics was ‘greater than it had ever been’ and warned an attack by extremists returning from Syria and Iraq was ‘highly likely’. If the Tories win the next election she pledged to reintroduce the Communications Data Bill – dubbed a ‘snoopers’ charter’ by opponents – which would require internet companies to keep records of every website their customers visit. MI5, MI6 and GCHQ insist they need extra powers to track down terrorists, crime gangs and paedophiles on the web. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has blocked the proposal, saying it would be a breach of civil liberties. Mrs May used her speech at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank in London to outline measures that will be included in the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill, to be published tomorrow. She denied the new laws were a ‘knee-jerk response to a sudden perceived threat’ and said the police had foiled 40 terrorist attacks since the July 7 bombings in London in 2005. ‘It is a properly considered, thought-through set of proposals that will keep us safe at a time of very significant danger,’ she said. Her flagship bill will for the first time place a statutory duty on public bodies to stop people from being radicalised. A university that refused to stop a planned talk or visit by a radical cleric could be ordered to do so by ministers – or face being taken to courts. The new counter-terror law would include powers to: . The new counter-terror law would include powers to Stop jihadists coming back to Britain from Syria for up to two years – their return being allowed only ‘on our terms’. Above, members of ISIS in Raqqa, Syria . Campaigners criticised the measures. Shami Chakrabarti, of human rights group Liberty, said: ‘Yet again, politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote.’ Earlier, Britain’s chief counter-terrorism police officer warned the threat from jihadists would last for many years to come, even if violence in Iraq and Syria subsided. Mark Rowley, an assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, said: ‘Even if the awfulness that’s happening in Syria and Iraq was miraculously to get sorted in the next year or so – and that looks a very optimistic “if” – there are other countries which are in parlous states and the potential for this type of terrorism to reach back into Europe and continue in other theatres is equally great.’ Meanwhile, an extremist Muslim preacher has been banned from a university campus for likening being gay to having a ‘disease’. Imran Ibn Mansur, 24, was due to appear at an event at the University of East London but the whole event was called off amid further concerns that male and female students would be segregated. Police and the security services could not have prevented the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby by two cleaver-wielding Muslim extremists, a long-awaited report is expected to say today. Parliament’s intelligence watchdog is likely to say it is almost impossible to stop ‘lone wolf’ terror attacks. The Intelligence and Security Committee investigation into the 25-year-old soldier’s slaying outside Woolwich Barracks in south-east London will flag up the difficulties of heading off atrocities where there is little planning and only one or two participants.","Home Secretary Theresa May unveiled anti-extremism policies yesterday .

"Test case: Unemployed people queue outside a French job centre. Six jobless people are claiming compensation from job agency Pole Emploi for failing to get them work . Six jobless French people are suing the country's employment agency for more than £1.5 million because they have not found any work. In what is set to become a test case which will have widespread implications across Europe, all of the group are being supported by the biggest trade union in the country. It comes as France's Socialist government struggles to cope with a spiralling unemployment rate which currently sees more than 3.2 million without work. While most blame President Francois Hollande's economic policies for this, the six claimants want the equivalent of £257,000 each from their job centres. They say they have not been provided them with enough leads or interviews where they can impress prospective bosses. Florent Hennequin, a lawyer for the claimants, said that a 'breach in contract' between them and their job centre has 'already been recognised' in early proceedings. Last September one of his clients, a 54-year-old former executive, said he had been forced to work part time delivering papers because he could not find a well-paid professional job. Despite being registered as unemployed . with his local job centre in the Paris suburbs for four years, he has . received 'only three appointments' to discuss a job 'despite repeated . requests'. None have led to any full-time work. Big money: The workers each want to sue Pole Emploi for the equivalent of £257,000 . The Paris Administrative Court has since ordered the job centre to 'meet its obligations', which should mean showing a more proactive role in helping the man. Blame game: Many blame French president Francois Hollande's policies for the country's current high rate of unemployment . Mr Hennequin said his client's case could not be dealt with as a simple administrative manner, so 'we're using the routine judicial route, with an appeal for compensation' from the state employment agency, which is called Pole Emploi. Representatives of the CGT trade union and lawyers for the jobseekers delivered their claim for compensation at the Pole Emploi headquarters in Paris at 10am today. 'If they reject it or fail to respond, we will get the administrative court involved' said Mr Hennequin. President Hollande is, like many of his predecessors, committed to creating state-subsidised jobs, which come with generous perks . This has led to an expectation among thousands that they should immediately get a tax payer funded job if they cannot find one in the public sector. But despite the cost of the vastly inflated public sector becoming untenable, French governments have steadfastly refused to reduce the vast amount of money it takes to employ someone in France. With the explosion in the unemployment figures, Pole Emploi has been unable to cope with the millions seeking work. A parliamentary report last month said it was 'too inefficient' for the task, and said its work should be 'simplified' by cutting down on red tape. If the claimants are successful in their compensation claim, then the case will become of huge interest to other unemployed people in the European Union, including those in Britain.","The group presented their case to Pole Emploi in Paris this morning .

"If you're in the market to buy a brownstone in Brooklyn, good luck - according to a new report, investors are swiping up brownstones in some of Brooklyn's emerging neighborhoods before they are ever put on the market. The run on brownstones is only adding to the lack of inventory and price increases for would-be buyers. These investors are paying cash for the buildings - primarily in the borough's Crown Heights, Bed-Stuy and Bushwick neighborhoods - and leasing the properties to renters rather than flipping them and re-selling them. $$$: Investors scooping up brownstones in Brooklyn is keeping many of the properties off the market and driving up prices . “They come to all the open houses, they see every property,” a 'tipster' told the blog Brownstoner. According to the blog, these investors 'go after everything' - foreclosures, houses that would normally sit on the market such as SROs (single-room occupancy) and wrecks, and regular properties that qualify for a mortgage. 'They are focusing on one- to three-families, the same types of houses . would-be homeowners are looking to purchase to occupy — not groups of . houses or large apartment buildings, although occasionally they pick up . single-family houses that have been subdivided into more than four . units,' the blog explains. According to the 'tipster,' she has encountered five investment firms, each of which is trying to buy five to 10 houses a month, all with cash. Some of the purchases, the tipster says, 'make no sense,' like SROs without certificates of non-harassment and properties with stop work orders on them. 'Everyone’s talking about there not being any inventory,' she said. 'There’s plenty of inventory, it’s just not being offered anymore...there’s so much money around. A lot is getting bought out quickly. They’re not end users.” Emerging: Bushwick, Bed-Stuy and Crown Heights are considered to be up-and-coming sections of Brooklyn . The blog spoke with a man who has been 'aggressively' looking to purchase a brownstone in Bed-Stuy, Bushwick or Crown Heights for the last two months, but says he keeps getting beat out by investors. 'It seems that I’m being outbid left and right by investors who are coming to the table with cash in hand as soon as (or before) the house lists,' he says. Realtors say that many of the investment groups are foreign, hailing mainly from Europe and Israel. One group, with the operating name of Newtown Jets, has scooped up 24 properties in Brooklyn since March. According to the blog, 'the transactions were all over the map geographically and pricewise, from . Park Slope ($2,675,000) and Carroll Gardens ($1,699,000) to Bushwick . ($662,500 and $599,000).' Newtown Jets is a subsidiary of US Masters Residential Property Fund, Alan Dixon, Managing Director and CEO of Dixon Leasing, told the blog. Renovations: an upside to investors buying brownstones is that they often renovate them and modernize the interiors . 'The fund . has purchased a total of 47 properties in Brooklyn since December 2012 . and has 22 under contract. (Each of its buying groups is named after an . Australian football team.) The fund has paid an average of $1,200,000 . per property,' the blog says. 'The fund buys to hold and rent for at least five years, as . required by the tax agreement between Australia and the U.S.' 'You buy a . property, renovate it, and the bank advances funds against a group of . property,” Dixon said. The upside to investors buying up in many cases dilapidated, old buildings is that they fix them up and renovate them. But in doing so, they drive up the cost and make living in Brooklyn nearly as expensive as living in Manhattan. 'Do you think investor groups snapping up property in Brooklyn could be . good, on the one hand, because they are fixing up and renting out . problem properties,' the blogger asks, 'or is it making Brooklyn unaffordable and creating . another unsustainable real estate bubble?'","Crown Heights, Bed-Stuy and Bushwick are the main targets for investment groups scooping up brownstones .

"Kate Silverton has warned against the growing trend of women who are starting to have children until they are in their forties after pursuing their careers. The BBC newsreader gave birth to her second child in June this year at the age of 43 and has a three-year-old daughter. However she said she is aware of the pressure for today's women to 'have it all' - many faced with the choice between pursuing their career in their 30s or putting it on hold to start a family. Scroll down for video . Kate Silverton, pictured with her daughter Clemency, is concerned women are feeling the pressure to pursue their careers and delay having a family, but said this can leave many struggling to conceive in their 40s . She told the Evening Standard: 'A lot of women I know are having huge difficulty trying to conceive and many are losing out by virtue of the fact that they can't see beyond their career, yet when they do come to a point where they are ready to start a family it is potentially too late.' Silverton, who got married in 2011, did not think she would be able to have children. After an operation to remove an ovary in 2009 after a cyst burst she had four rounds of IVF which did not work. She then conceived naturally. The newsreader has gone freelance since having a family and says she is fully enjoying spending time with her children. She also said she takes them into work when she needs to, and admitted she has probably created havoc. Silverton has taken her daughter Clemency to work with her, they are pictured in the studios in October 2012 . She also refuses to accept that being a mother means she cannot do anything else. The newsreader, who is a keen supporter of African charity the Tusk Trust, recently appeared with her daughter Clemency to give a speech at the Royal Geographical Society. Silverton said she felt lucky to have been able to pursue a successful career in her thirties, become financially stable and then have a family, but was aware that for a lot of women this would not be possible. Silverton said she felt lucky to have had two children in her after pursuing a career at the BBC . 'I know not everyone has that luxury — in the future we might look back on that and think it was terribly sad, I'm not sure we got it right,' she added. Miss Silverton gave birth to her second child, Wilbur Silverton Heron in June. She named her son after author Wilbur Smith who wrote about Africa and inspired her love for the country. She said after her daughter Clemency was born she was told she had just a two per cent chance of getting pregnant and her and her husband were incredibly surprised to have a second child. The 44-year-old said she believes it is important to have a debate about whether it is best to delay having children or start a family early and acknowledges that is rarely possible to 'have it all. ' Silverton said she would like to explore how families can be helped financially so they can have children earlier rather than feeling the pressure to save before they can have children. She suggests ideas of mortgage holidays for parents to make starting a family easier.","Kate Silverton gave birth to her second child Wilbur this year at age of 43 .

He . also told the Times in a phone interview Tuesday that a scene featuring . Mitt Romney appearing to oppose the raid was removed. ‘We wouldn’t air . this if it were propaganda,’ he explained. Days go by: Only a day before the raid, Mr Obama was cracking jokes at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington . The president and his campaign had nothing to do with the creation of the movie, Mr Weinstein said. The producer also noted that he has been a supporter of Republican candidates, like New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The Times reported that Mr Weinstein purchased the rights to the movie for around $2.5million at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

"A thriving organised market in counterfeit items, with Delhi at its centre, is driving an economy running into several thousand crores. A Mail Today investigation has discovered that skillfully-run establishments sell anything from cosmetic products, packaged items of common use, electronic appliances, computer accessories, auto parts mobile phone accessories and more making the National Capital the hub of counterfeit goods. They flourish because of lower costs but the investigation revealed that these goods find their way into the market and are often sold as genuine products at the MRP of a regular item. Fake: A report by Assocham indicates that besides being a big market for fake products, the Capital is the main transit point for the sale of such goods . Gaffar Market: One of the largest markets in the country for counterfeit and smuggled products in the categories of mobile phones and accessories, cosmetic items and commonly used electronic appliances . Sadar Bazar: Wholesale market in Old Delhi where one can get all sorts of fake items, including packaged FMCG and cosmetic items from selected shops . Some markets where these goods are easily available and sold openly like any legitimate business are Gaffar Market, Sadar Bazar, Khari Baoli, Bhagirath Place, Nehru Place and Kashmere Gate. Gaffar Market has come to be known for counterfeit and smuggled mobile phones and accessories, cosmetic items and commonly used electronic appliances. Sadar Bazar is a wholesale market in Old Delhi where fake packaged FMCG goods and cosmetic items can be bought from select shops. All have a regular clientele. Kashmere Gate is one of the largest auto parts markets in the country. Some shops sell fake branded auto spares at one fifth the original price or less. Nehru Place is big computer accessories markets and one can get pirated software and fake hardware from there. Market size . According to a report by industry body Assocham, the current market size of counterfeit products is Rs 45,000 crore. Of this Delhi alone contributes nearly 75 per cent to the production of fake goods. The report indicates that besides being a big market for fake products, the Capital is the main transit point for the sale of such goods. One dealer who admitted to selling fake cosmetic items said: ""We don't sell these items to every trader. We have old and trusted traders from Delhi and outside."" On the price difference, he said, while a case of original talcum powder would Rs 120, the fake one costs Rs 50 or less. Bhagirath Place Market: Wholesale market at Chandni Chowk where one can get fake and smuggled electronic appliances . Kashmere Market: One of the largest auto parts markets in the country. Some shops sell fake-branded auto spares at one fifth of the original price or even less . Nehru Place: Asia's biggest computer accessories market. One can get all sorts of pirated software and fake hardware parts from this place . ""We sell it to the retailers at Rs 55-60. And, the retailer will sell it to the customers as a genuine product at the maximum price or a bit less,"" he added. When asked about the packaging and appearance, he hesitatingly showed a bottle of a wellknown brand. ""Can you say that this is not an original bottle?"" he asked. Sri Ram Khanna of Consumer Voice said counterfeiting is rampant. ""There are two situations. In one case a consumer buys the fake item without being aware of it. In this situation he gets cheated as he is paying for the original. In the second case, there are counterfeit products which are available at lower prices. ""Suppose, a mechanic tells you about the low quality auto part before fitting it in your vehicle. Here, you are not cheated as you are aware of this, but, the product is obviously of sub-standard quality."" Anil Rajput, chairman of Ficci-CASCADE, said that almost all packaged and non packaged items are being copied and Delhi is the centre of the illegal business. ""In most cases, people are being cheated as they are not aware that the products they are buying are fake ones. Once consumed, the result can be dangerous in case of fake products,"" he added. Alarming signs . Big companies like Philips India, Hindustan Unilever and Heinz India have raised an alarm on this front and their complaints saw separate cases being registered with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police last month. Last year Delhi Police raided a store in Central Delhi area, seizing a huge stock of counterfeit cosmetics, including those labelled as Revlon, Ponds and Dove. The police action unearthed a fake packaging factory, bringing the focus on the need for secure packaging and labelling for cosmetics and pharma items in India. Explaining the techniques adopted by the manufacturers, a police officer said: ""Nowaday's the manufactures situated in Outer Delhi and northeast Delhi areas have started using advanced machines. ""To make it appear original, they also use computerised and digital machines to write prices, manufacturing dates and batch numbers on the packets. You can't make out the differences."" The sale of counterfeit products is not only affecting consumers but it's also causing heavy losses to the government as well as the private sector. Anil Rajput, chairman, Ficci-CASCADE (Committee Against Smuggling and Counterfeiting Activities Destroying the Economy) said the business of fake items is a cause of concern for everybody. ""This is causing losses to the government due to tax evasion. The sales of industries are badly affected. It is also causing losses to the consumers as they are being cheated into purchasing substandard items,"" he added. The Ficci-CASCADE study on ""Socio-economic Impact of Counterfeiting, Smuggling and Tax Evasion in Seven Key Industry Sectors"" revealed that the estimated annual tax loss to the government in 2012 is estimated at Rs 26,190 crore. The study further estimates an annual sales loss to industry of a whopping Rs 1,00,000 crore. The key sectors which were included in the study were auto components, alcohol, computer hardware, FMCG (personal goods), FMCG (packaged goods), mobile phones and tobacco. The highest loss in terms of revenue is from FMCG (packaged goods) at Rs 20,378 crore (23.4%), FMCG (personal goods) at Rs 15,035 crore (25.9%), auto components at Rs 9,198 crore (29.6%), mobile phones at Rs 9,042 crore (20.8%) and tobacco at Rs 8,965 crore (15.7%). The maximum tax loss on account of smuggled and counterfeit products to the government is from the tobacco sector at Rs 6, 240 crore followed by FMCG (packaged food) at Rs 5,660 crore and FMCG (personal goods) at Rs 4,646 crore. Rajput said excessive taxation is one of the main reasons behind flourishing of the business of fake items. ""Heavy taxes on products have led to flourishing of the fake goods markets. To avoid paying high taxes, people get trapped into buying cheaper products,"" he added. Similarly, a study by Assocham said Delhi accounts for 75 per cent of the rapidly growing counterfeit industry in the country and the current market size of the counterfeit products is Rs 45,000 crore. It also said the maximum loss for FMCG companies works out to 45 per cent, though on an average, it is around 25 per cent of the market share of well-known products. Assocham's study showed that other segments that were hit by fake goods sale are vegetable oils, spices, ghee and watch components. The sale of spurious products in these product categories has been estimated to be close to Rs 15,000 crore by 2013. The industry body estimated that by the end of 2013, counterfeit goods market in India will be worth more than Rs 55,000 crore.","Capital is the main transit point for the sale of black market goods .

"The Duchess of Cambridge was moved to tears yesterday as she listened to a mother recall the heartbreak of losing her three-month-old daughter. After Leigh Smith had finished her speech at the charity event, Kate reacted as any mother would – by throwing her arms around her to comfort her. Mrs Smith, 33, whose daughter Beatrice died of a heart condition earlier this year, said: ‘Kate sought me out and gave me a hug just before she left. ‘I was getting quite teary-eyed, she had tears in her eyes and she just said to me, “You’re a very brave lady and again, I’m just so, so sorry”.’ Scroll down for video .

In return, she received a reply from Kate herself. ‘I was so surprised to receive a letter with such personal comments and signed by her,’ Mrs Smith said. ‘It was a lovely gesture and helped me through a terrible time. ‘I was touched that she had taken so much time to carefully read my letter and then to reply herself – it shows how much she cares. ‘When I met her today she remembered the letter and said it was an honour to meet me. I was completely taken aback. For me it was an honour to meet her.’ The duchess, who is 18 weeks pregnant with her second child, was attending the launch of a fundraising campaign to help EACH build a £10million facility in Norfolk.

But she struggled to keep her emotions in check as she listened intently to Mrs Smith’s tragic story, which detailed the assistance that the charity gave her family. Beatrice Octavia Iris Smith was born in November last year and was diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy, a rare heart condition, in January. After six weeks in hospital it became clear that she would not survive until a new heart could be found for her.

Friday would have been Beatrice’s first birthday. Mrs Smith added: ‘I had mixed feelings about today because it’s a difficult time, but this is the most amazing way of celebrating Beatrice’s birthday and I hope she was looking down as I met Kate.’ The duchess has already been playing an active role in the fundraising drive for the charity’s new facility. She has persuaded potter Emma Bridgewater to design a range of mugs, which were unveiled yesterday and will be sold in aid of the campaign next year. A royal aide said: ‘It was the duchess’s idea to approach Emma, whom she didn’t know previously, and she helped in the design process.’ Kate has been patron of EACH since 2012 and made her first public speech as a member of the royal family on its behalf the same year. She and Prince William are expecting their second child in April. Prince George is now 16 months old.

"A draft of one of the most popular songs of all time, Bob Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone', sold today for $2million, which the auction house called a world record for a popular music manuscript. A working draft of the finished song in Dylan's own hand went to an unidentified bidder at Sotheby's. The selling price, $2.045million, included a buyer's premium. The manuscript is 'the only known surviving draft of the final lyrics for this transformative rock anthem', Sotheby's said. Bob Dylan, pictured here strumming his acoustic guitar and smoking a cigarette in 1961 in New York City, wrote 'Like a Rolling Stone' in 1965.

"Investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown continue, despite a grand jury decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson, the US Attorney General has said. The Justice Department will continue to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead 18-year-old unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force. The Attorney General also addressed the violence which has followed the St. Louis County jury’s decision saying ’it does not honour Michael Brown’s memory to engage in violence or looting’. Scroll down for video . It's not over: Federal investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown will continue despite grand jury decision, Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement on Monday . Violent riots broke out in Ferguson late Monday night, and protests have been held across the country, following a grand jury decision not to indict white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting of black teenager Michael Brown. However, the FBI and the Justice Department are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson, and a broader inquiry has been launched into the police practices of the overwhelmingly white Ferguson force, which operates in a predominantly black community. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement following the conclusion of the grand jury proceeding, that the federal inquiry has always been independent of the one in the St. Louis County, and will remain so. ‘While the grand jury proceeding in St. Louis County has concluded, the Justice Department’s investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown remains ongoing,’ Attorney General Eric Holder , 63, said. ‘In addition, the Department continues to investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department.' The Justice Department are investigating whether it can be shown that Officer Wilson (right) willfully deprived 18-year-old Michael Brown (left) of his civil rights when he shot him several times while he was unarmed . Violence: Police gather on the streets of Ferguson as protesters react after the announcement of the grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown . The Justice Department will continue to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Darren Wilson when he shot Michael Brown and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force . Tears: A female protester uses milk to counter police  pepper spray after a group of demonstrators attempted to stop traffic on Interstate 5 in Ferguson, Missouri . Attorney General Holder added: 'Michael Brown’s death was a tragedy. This incident has sparked a national conversation about the need to ensure confidence between law enforcement and the communities they protect and serve. 'Though there will be disagreement with the grand jury's decision not to indict, this feeling should not lead to violence. 'Those who decide to participate in demonstrations should remember the wishes of Michael Brown's parents, who have asked that remembrances of their son be conducted peacefully. It does not honor his memory to engage in violence or looting. 'In the coming days, it will likewise be important for local law enforcement authorities to respect the rights of demonstrators, and deescalate tensions by avoiding excessive displays—and uses—of force . Federal investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution against Officer Wilson. Whereas the county grand jury could consider multiple charges, Justice Department lawyers have a single focus: whether it can be shown that Officer Wilson willfully deprived 18-year-old Michael Brown of his civil rights. That is a difficult burden to meet, especially considering the wide latitude given to police officers in using deadly force. Riots in the streets: Policemen clash with protesters in Ferguson after mass riots broke out overnight . Missouri Burning: A car on fire outside the Ferguson Police Department on Monday night . Two sides: Protesters confront black police officers during a march in Ferguson . A group of protesters vandalize a police vehicle after the announcement of the grand jury decision . The inquiry into the practices of the entire Ferguson Police department is focusing on stops, searches and arrests and generally looking for patterns of discrimination within the overwhelmingly white department. It has the potential to require major changes in the policing methods of the Ferguson force. Such broader reviews typically rely on data and interviews in the community and can take far longer than a criminal investigation. The Justice Department has initiated roughly 20 investigations of troubled police departments in the past five years, or more than twice the number undertaken in the five years before that. And regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation, there's also the potential that Michael Brown's family could file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Wilson. The Attorney General said he expects the federal investigation into the shooting to be concluded before he leaves office, a move which is expected to be imminent as Obama picked his choice of replacement earlier this month. Brooklyn federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch, 55, was announced as the President’s choice over two weeks ago, but needs to be confirmed by the Senate. If she is confirmed, Ms Lynch would make history as the first black woman to serve as attorney general. What other investigations are underway? The FBI and the Justice Department are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations. Investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution. Whereas the county grand jury could consider multiple charges, Justice Department lawyers have a single focus: whether it can be shown that Wilson willfully deprived Brown of his civil rights. That is a difficult burden to meet, especially considering the wide latitude given to police officers in using deadly force. Some other past high-profile police shootings, including the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo in New York City, did not result in federal prosecutions. What about broader allegations of racial insensitivity on the part of the Ferguson police department? Beyond the shooting itself, the Justice Department is conducting a wide-reaching investigation into the practices of the entire department. That investigation is focusing on stops, searches and arrests and generally looking for patterns of discrimination within the overwhelmingly white department. It has the potential to require major changes in the policing methods of the Ferguson force. Such broader reviews typically rely on data and interviews in the community and can take far longer than a criminal investigation. The Justice Department has initiated roughly 20 investigations of troubled police departments in the past five years, or more than twice the number undertaken in the five years before that. And regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation, there's also the potential that Brown's family could file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Wilson. How long might these other investigations go on? The Justice Department has not set a timeline for either investigation, though outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder has said he expects the federal investigation into the shooting to be concluded before he leaves office. He said late on Monday that that investigation was independent of the local probe, and that ""we have avoided prejudging any of the evidence."" How will authorities deal with any protests? President Barack Obama appealed for calm and understanding Monday after the no-indictment announcement, saying the country needed 'to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make.' Holder, too, said the decision should not lead to violence. Even so, within minutes of the announcement, crowds in the streets of Ferguson shattered windows, vandalized cars and taunted police while officers released smoke and pepper spray to disperse the gatherings. In anticipation of the protests, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon pre-emptively declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. Gun sales surged before the grand jury decision and some shop owners boarded up their stores. A federal law enforcement team has been working with top commanders in Ferguson and from neighboring police departments to help reduce tensions and build trust. Are there longer-term efforts to deal with underlying problems? Nixon several days ago named 16 members to a panel aimed at helping the community heal after the shooting. The commission, which will study underlying social and economic conditions, is expected to make recommendations in a report due by September 2015.","Attorney General Eric Holder said federal investigation continues .

"As thousands of fans and the world’s paparazzi lined the canals in Venice last weekend, there was clearly one star draw: Hollywood’s most famously fanciable film star, George Clooney, was marrying at long, long last. But as the pictures of the state-like, four-day ceremony flooded in, it became clear that all eyes were not, in fact, on the Oscar-winning silver fox. Instead, they were on his new wife, Amal Alamuddin, and her string of incredible outfits. In the space of one weekend, not only did Amal become Mrs Clooney, she also became an international fashion icon. Scroll down for video . Kate looks like a summery milkmaid in a short-sleeved lace dress by Australian brand Zimmerman, on tour Down Under. Meanwhile Amal, in her first post-wedding appearance on Sunday, updates the style with a leg-flashing, long-sleeved, racy and lacy white Giambattista Valli haute couture dress, teamed with his golden Specchio slingbacks . Classic Kate is shipshape at the National Maritime Museum in a navy and white dress by British stalwart Jaeger. But in the same colours, Amal is simply stunning in a Stella McCartney trouser suit . Kate is sugar-almond sweet in a pink dress by Emilia Wickstead at a palace garden party. Amal in the same colour looks to have stepped straight out of a fashion shoot in her sassy Sixties-style frock . And, as one winning outfit after another appeared — from a fiery scarlet floor-length gown to a wonderful white lace creation — fashionistas were quick to compare her with the style queen whose crown she appears to have stolen: the Duchess of Cambridge. For while the two women are equally adept at smart, chic fashion, Amal, it seems, is outdoing Kate in every way. When Kate, 32, chooses a pretty, long-sleeved, white lace frock, Amal, 36, takes the same shape but adds bold boning and bright pink flowers. While Kate loves vibrant shades of pink and red, Amal takes exactly the same hues but swaps Kate’s straight, pencil-skirt fit for a flared shape or updates it with a more modern cut. While the fiery red of Kate’s Beulah gown is striking, the billowing sleeves make it old fashioned — especially compared with Amal’s firecracker version at her wedding rehearsal dinner in Venice . Pre-marriage Kate is the innocent country lass in her floral dress and pink cardigan. Yet Amal manages to look powerful and flowerful in a colourful Oscar de la Renta dress and brave yellow pumps in Florence . Where Kate does safe, smart and sometimes staid, Amal lifts the look and applies a whirl of modern-meets-timeless. Perhaps Amal’s serious job, as a human rights lawyer at London’s distinguished Doughty Street Chambers, encourages her to be fun and frivolous when it comes to off-duty fashion. In court, she must wear the dowdy barrister’s uniform of black and white under heavy robes and itchy horsehair wig — meaning she can only show off her style credentials away from the workplace. Kate is ladylike in a scarlet Catherine Walker coat and dress worn with her trusty nude platforms. Amal is smart but modern, too, in a Paule Ka suit, while striking floral slingbacks give a dash of surprise . No such escape awaits Kate, of course, as she is constrained by royal protocol at all times. She is also naturally conservative, as befits the future Queen, and always chooses safe, appropriate attire. So where Amal likes short skirts, Kate sticks to knee-length, and while Amal experiments with flares and jeans, Kate rarely wears trousers in her public life. Kate can sometimes look a little frumpy. At least, that is the effect when seen against Amal, with her impeccable knack of giving her wardrobe a clever twist. Kate is safe and suitable in a sparkly, tweed suit by New Zealand designer Rebecca Taylor at an official reception. Amal wears a similar Paule Ka suit for work, but with a hipper, trendier cut, giving a flash of cleavage . In black velvet by Alexander McQueen, Kate is reminiscent of a pre-marriage Princess Diana. Her dress is eye-catching, until you see Amal’s similar, but racier, Dolce & Gabbana satin gown, with fabulous earrings . Amal has a youthful, devil-may-care approach: she is unafraid of ripped jeans, camouflage, jumpsuits, eccentric jewellery, floppy hats, short shorts and things that drape rather than cling. She also doesn’t mind exposing a bit of flesh. So Amal’s skirts are that bit shorter than Kate’s, and her shoes are that bit higher and glitzier than the Duchess’s sensible footwear choices. If anyone marvelled at one of our biggest and best-known movie stars marrying a ‘normal’ woman in Amal, her fashion parade has shown she has oodles of movie-star glamour herself and can more than handle herself on the world stage. The duchess is neat, chic and safe in a feminine Lela Rose peplum dress and black Jimmy Choo shoes. Amal wears white, too — but is more edgy in her less-fitted dress worn with statement necklace and platform sandals . She combines the clean, sharp lines (and big shades) of Jackie Onassis, the beauty of Sophia Loren, and the boldness of Michelle Obama with an unrestrained taste for designer fashion. And if more proof were needed, there’s already an ‘Amal effect’: the Dolce & Gabbana monochrome dress she wore for her arrival in Venice sold out immediately, and blogs have sprung up across the internet dedicated to her wardrobe. So while it was once impossible to conceive that anyone could out-chic Kate Middleton — just as it was unimaginable Clooney would ever remarry — Amal has achieved both in one amazing weekend.

"Scientists have announced that they are close to developing an effective treatment using stem cells to restore teeth that require treatment for cavities. They say they the novel procedure could replace root canals, fillings and even caps. Currently cavities are treated by removing any inflamed pulp surrounding it and filling or capping the tooth. But this has limited success and the problem frequently progresses until the tooth must be removed. Say 'aaaah': Unpleasant procedures such as the root canal could be consigned to the history books if Japanese scientists continue to develop their procedure using stem cells . 'Dental cavities and inflammation of the surrounding pulp is a challenging public health issue, as tooth decay not only can cause a patient great pain but it also can lead to other serious health issues including heart disease,' explained Dr Misako Nakashima, of the National Centrr for Geriatrics and Gerontology in Obu, Japan. Tooth decay occurs when bacteria or infections compromise a tooth's natural repair process. If the tooth erodes the hard, outer enamel and penetrates down inside the tooth, the infection eventually can kill the soft pulp tissue inside, prompting the need for either a root canal or removal of the tooth. Pulp is necessary to detecting sensation, including heat, cold and pressure, and contains the stem cells - undifferentiated cells that turn into specialised ones - that can regenerate tooth tissue. The study, conducted by Dr Nakashima and colleagues along with scientists from Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories in Kagoshima and from the School of Dentistry at Aichi-gakuin University in Nagoya, tested a stem cell-based therapy that would regenerate the pulp and, consequently, totally restore the tooth’s previous healthy structure. At the same time, they wanted to assess the safety of pulp stem cell transplantation in humans as a prelude to upcoming clinical trials. The study was conducted on dogs but it is hoped clinical trials on humans will be carried out in the near future . They began by performing root canals on a group of 18 dogs, collecting the pulp stem cells and then treating them in the lab with a growth factor called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). When they examined the results, which included comparing the G-CSF treated cells to a control group of non-treated cells, they found the cells did indeed regenerate the pulp tissue and completely filled in the dogs’ root canals. 'We also noted that the pulp stem cells treated with G-CSF yielded a significantly larger amount of regenerated dentin-pulp complex than those without it,' Dr. Nakashima observed. 'Also noteworthy was the reduced number of inflammatory cells, the decrease in cell death and the significant increase in neurite outgrowth (the projections that transfer a cell’s impulses compared to those without G-CSF). Furthermore, there was no evidence of toxicity or adverse events.' Based on these preclinical results of efficacy and safety, a clinical trial of pulp regeneration has already been initiated with the permission of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, she added. The findings were published in the journal  STEM CELLS Translational Medicine.","Japanese scientists have trialled a stem cell treatment for teeth on dogs .

"Nigel Pearson’s tenure at Leicester City descended into farce on Sunday night with the club forced to release a statement insisting they had not sacked him. Members of Pearson’s backroom staff had been told he had left, 24 hours after he grabbed Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur by the throat. But Leicester, after more than three hours of silence despite his ‘sacking’ being widely reported, eventually confirmed that he will be staying — for now.

Nigel, his staff and the first-team squad are focused on Tuesday night’s trip to Arsenal and our continued efforts to secure our position in the Barclays Premier League.’ That was in stark contrast to what Pearson and his staff believed earlier on Sunday. In the morning Pearson feared the worst after chief executive Susan Wheeler had been summoned to Thailand to see the club’s owners the Srivaddhanaprabha family. And news of Pearson’s ‘sacking’ even made ITV’s 10pm news at the same time Leicester released their statement. His job had been in the spotlight after he put his hands around McArthur’s throat while the Palace man was lying down on the touchline during Saturday’s home defeat which left Leicester rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table. McArthur cried out ‘get off me’, but the Leicester boss dismissed the incident as a playful confrontation.

Pearson and McArthur have history after Leicester agreed a fee to sign the player from Wigan last summer only for the deal to collapse at the last minute. ‘I have no problem with the lad,’ said Pearson after Saturday’s incident. ‘He’s a likeable lad. I’m as disappointed as he was with how things (his transfer) panned out. But it’s the other club (Wigan) who take absolute responsibility for anything that wasn’t quite right. And a certain manager (then Wigan boss Uwe Rosler), who opened his trap when he should have kept his mouth shut.’ Pearson was at the centre of controversy earlier in the season after arguing with Leicester fans. Footage emerged in December showing him telling a fan to ‘**** off and die’ during the 3-1 home defeat against Liverpool. But the 51-year-old offered a relaxed interpretation of events and refused to apologise.","Sportsmail understood Nigel Pearson and members of his staff had been sacked on Sunday evening .

"A worker sorting trash at a Southern California recycling plant has found a dead baby girl on a conveyor belt. The child's body, wrapped in a blanket, was discovered Thursday morning at the facility in Victorville. There is no immediate word on the child's age, and remains unclear whether the baby was killed or was stillborn. An autopsy has been scheduled to determine the cause and manner of death. Horrific discovery: The baby's body was found at Burrtec Waste Industries in Victorville . Tragic find: Authorities say a worker sorting trash at the plant found the infant's body . Authorities said the recycling center serves residents and businesses in the High Desert area northeast of Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Mountains. The horrific discovery was made just before 11.30am when an employee at Burrtec Waste Industries in the 17000 block of Abbey Lane found came across a deceased infant swaddled in a blanket while sorting through recyclables. ‘The sheriff's department is asking that the public, anyone who has information of a female may have recently given birth and who does not have their baby in their custody, that they would please call sheriff's homicide,’ said Jodi Miller, with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, according to the station KTLA.

"Statins have virtually no side effects, a major study shows. Scientists found that patients taking the cholesterol-busting drugs were less likely to suffer adverse symptoms than a control group taking a placebo. For years, statins have been linked to numerous side effects including nausea, insomnia, fatigue, kidney issues, muscle problems and even erectile dysfunction. Statins: Draft NHS guidelines will advise men over 50 and women over 60 to take the drugs as a precaution . But researchers at Imperial College London, who looked at 29 trials with more than 80,000 patients, found the drug raised only the risk of diabetes. Draft NHS guidelines will advise men over 50 and women over 60 to take the drugs as a precaution. This could see the number of people taking statins – currently around seven million – rise to 12 million. The research, published in the European Journal of Preventative Cardiology, shows that only a small amount of the reported symptoms are attributable to statins. Judith Finegold, of the heart and lung institute at Imperial College, said: ‘Most people in the general population will not feel perfectly well in every way on every day. More than a million prescriptions for statins – dubbed a miracle drug – are written each week in England, up from a few thousand in 1981. The drugs reduce cholesterol, the waxy fat-like substance which can build up in the arteries, raising the risk of heart disease and stroke. They work by blocking an enzyme involved in the production of ‘bad’ cholesterol, especially in the liver. Studies suggest statins may also protect against health problems such as eye disorders and Alzheimer’s by maintaining a healthy supply of blood to the brain. The most serious side effect was previously thought to be myopathy, resulting in muscle pain. Others include cataracts, headaches, loss of appetite and nerve pain. For years, a medical debate has raged over the risks and benefits of statins. Some have questioned their benefits for women, as fewer women have taken part in drug trials. ‘Why should they suddenly feel well when taking a tablet after being warned of possible adverse affects. ‘We believe that patients should be empowered to make their own decisions, but we must first make sure they have top quality unbiased information. This is why we call on drug regulators to highlight in the long list of side effects those few whose rate is incrementally greater than that experienced with a dummy tablet.’ However, some sections of the medical community still believe it is wrong to dismiss side effects of statins, because many patients under-report them in clinical trials. Aseem Malhotra, a cardiology specialist, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘To suggest that these symptoms are imagined is an insult to patients who have suffered, many for months, from side effects that are real and increasingly appreciated by frontline doctors.’ Earlier this month doctors recommended Britons should be taking more statins to decrease their chances of heart attacks and strokes. They used to prescribe only to those who had a 30 per cent or greater risk of suffering a heart attack within a decade. This was lowered to a 20 per cent risk in 2005, but now medics could be handing pills to those with just a 10 per cent risk. Even patients aged 80 and over are likely to get them despite little evidence they will benefit. The new rules would make at least ten million patients eligible for anti-cholesterol drugs, securing Britain’s place as the statins capital of Europe. Nice says the draft guidance will make clear that doctors should first work with patients to help put them less at risk, such as stopping smoking, drinking less, taking exercise and eating healthily. High intensity statin therapy, with a drug such as atorvastatin, should be offered to patients once these factors have been addressed.","Overview of 29 studies found the drugs raised only the risk of diabetes .

"At first glance, they appear an odd couple: the beautiful, 24-year-old Hollywood darling Jennifer Lawrence and rangy, 37-year-old British crooner Chris Martin. Yet they’ve been photographed together strolling off a private jet and spotted backstage together at his concert. Jennifer Lawrence, star of not one but two hit franchises, The Hunger Games and X-Men, is Hollywood’s most in-demand leading lady. Scroll down for video . Chris Martin recently consciously uncoupled from Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow (left) and has been spotted strolling off a private jet with Jennifer Lawrence (right) Already an Oscar winner, as well as a face of Christian Dior, she is refreshingly outspoken and funny. Presumably she has her pick of men. So who does Miss Hollywood choose? None other than Chris Martin, a dad of two from Devon. He, of course, has form in the starry dating arena, having recently consciously uncoupled from another Oscar winner and Dior face, Gwyneth Paltrow. To attract one Oscar hottie might be good fortune, but two says the guy has something few others can offer. And if two Oscar blondes weren’t enough, he’s been spotted with Rihanna, too, and TV presenter Alexa Chung, although his people have denied he dated her. But no one can deny he bats at a very high level. Vogue cover girls only. The Coldplay singer has  carved out a niche so specific that only he occupies it . So what is it about Chris Martin that women find so irresistible? The answer is that he has carved out a niche so specific that only he occupies it. It makes him catnip to rich, Anglophile celebrity women who fancy themselves as having liberal values but also have middle-class aspirations. To start with — his looks. As one friend who has met him says: ‘He’s good-looking but not absurdly so; it’s not like M&S underwear model David Gandy where looks become the whole point. He sort of grows on you. And he’s very trim and fit.’ He has always been clean-living, but years with Gwyneth have refined him into a healthy-eating person who works out, and it shows. There were pictures of him doing cartwheels to impress Jennifer. But while lots of men are handsome and fit, very few are rock stars — and, of course, Chris’s role as Coldplay’s voice, heart and soul is his key calling card. He plays piano, keyboard and guitar and writes most of the words and music. Even better, if he falls in love with you, he writes songs for you, like a Renaissance poet crafting sonnets to his love. Fix You, the song he wrote for Gwyneth in 2005 after her father died, is one of the most moving expressions of grief in recent years. Already an Oscar winner,J-Law has her pick of the men, so she goes for none other than Chris Martin, a dad of two from Devon . He has always been clean-living, but years with Gwyneth have refined him into a healthy-eating person who works out, and it shows . A handsome, musical-genius rock star will, of course, be inundated with offers. But unlike most rock stars, Chris is a well-brought-up, upper-middle-class boy of some academic distinction who just happens to be a musician. In spite of his fame and 80 million records sold, he knows how to hold a knife and fork, will open doors and can converse on Plato. And he is English, a sign of refinement in some American eyes. To a Hollywood girl, he must seem like elegance personified, a lyricist of startling imagination with a trump card: that male rarity, emotional intelligence. Which brings us to his very English, privileged background. Chris was brought up by Anthony, 73, a retired chartered accountant, magistrate and president of the local cricket club, and Alison, 60, a music teacher, in a beautiful Georgian grade II-listed pile set in eight acres, with a paddock for ponies and a tennis court, in the hamlet of Whitestone near Exeter. The eldest of five, he was educated at traditional, fee-paying Sherborne School (alma mater of such English gents as Hugh Bonneville, Jeremy Irons and Stanley Johnson, father of Boris). His father is believed to be a multi-millionaire from the sale of the slightly-less-grand-sounding Martins of Exeter, a caravan company founded by Chris’s grandfather in 1929. From Sherborne, Chris went to University College, London and read Ancient World Studies, graduating with a first-class degree. Coldplay was formed with friends there, but sensible Chris refused to release an album until after their finals. Hell-raiser he most certainly is not. He’s so well-behaved that some rival male rock stars, and some men in general, find him rather annoying. Typically ungentlemanly, Oasis’s Noel Gallagher said: ‘Chris Martin looks like a geography teacher.’ A man I know who spent a weekend with him said: ‘He made a pious speech about how he always carried his own bags.’ A speech many women would find endearing, but which makes some men want to hit him. So: posh, educated, well-mannered and rich, too. Some female stars are happy to date backing dancers, fitness trainers, and men who’ve stalked them on Twitter, but the likes of Jennifer Lawrence don’t want to worry whether a prospective beau is more smitten by their celebrity status and hard cash than their lovely self. Plus, he’s far from a publicity-seeker. If it always seemed churlish that he avoided being photographed with Gwyneth, he is not about to post more embarrassingly compromising pictures of Jennifer on the internet or tweet a photo of their main course. People who’ve met him say he’s ‘insanely funny — you can’t stop laughing’; and Simon Pegg, the comic actor, is one of his children’s godfathers. Which brings us to possibly the most compelling part of the Chris Martin love-god story: Gwyneth. That he’s been through tough house-training by the perfectionist actress has proven him a fitting husband. He’s also very obviously a hands-on father to Apple, ten, and Moses, eight. ‘He’s the sort of chap who can cook a roast, chat to your parents, cheer up a friend and play with the children,’ says my friend. Jennifer is younger and more devil-may-care than her predecessor — she once admitted vomiting at an Oscars’ after-party with some pride in her voice. The romance is not yet three months old. One thing’s for sure, though: if it doesn’t work out, Mr Martin, given that he’s rich, funny, handsome, discreet, kind, and emotionally literate, should have no trouble finding a replacement.","Coldplay's Chris Martin has dated some of Hollywood's hottest women .

"Tesco has apologised after a horror-themed colouring book featuring gruesome pictures of blood, knives and screaming victims was marketed at children as young as five. The book, called Colour Me Good - Arrggghhhh!!, features graphic drawings to colour in taken from famous horror films, including the man with nails in his head from Hellraiser, the woman holding a knife by her face from Misery, and a straitjacketed Anthony Hopkins in The Silence Of The Lambs. Grandfather Chris Tuckwood came across the 16-page book while he was searching for a birthday present for his seven-year-old grandson, Reece. Good present for a five-year-old? Tesco thought so, but has now apologised and removed it from sale . The colouring book features drawings from 18-rated horror films such as Hellraiser - this is the villain, Pinhead . The blurb on the back cover says the book contains 'really scary stuff' and 'more blood than you can shake a dagger at'. Inside, there are line drawings of iconic stills from terrifying 18-rated films aimed at adults, including Fatal Attraction, The Shining, and Carrie and A Clockwork Orange. Mr Tuckwood, 56, of Derby, who found the book on Tesco's website, said: 'It was advertised as being suitable for kids from five to eight - I don’t think so. 'It is unbelievable that they can sell such a thing aimed at kids. I don’t think I have to say why it’s unsuitable, that much is obvious. 'Who on earth are they employing that thinks this is OK?' A Tesco spokesman said the product was placed on the company’s website by the book’s publisher. He said: 'We have very clear guidelines for third-party sellers who list items on our website, and are sorry that on this occasion they weren’t followed. Fatal Attraction: The moment when Glenn Close puts a rabbit belonging to her lover's child into boiling water . Child-killer Freddy Kruger from Nightmare On Elm Street, left, and the eponymous Carrie covered in pigs' blood . 'We will be speaking with the seller to remind them of the importance of selecting the right category when listing products with us. 'Of course when issues do arise we act quickly with the seller to ensure that the item is updated with the correct information.' But Siobhan Freegard, founder of . Netmums.com, said retailers had to 'take responsibility and . help parents and schools in the difficult job of protecting our . children and allowing them to retain some innocence in childhood.' She added: 'Protecting our children . from violent and sexual imagery is almost impossible in this digital . world and those who believe it is just “down to the parents” only have . to look at this example to see that. 'However much we block internet porn . at home, or refuse to buy overtly sexy clothing, there is always another . leak springing up round the corner. 'This book is a gruesome find and yet . it is easy to imagine it arriving by post as a gift from a caring . grandparent who knows his or her grandson likes 'baddies' without having . seen the content, as it is positioned as suitable for children.' The book’s publisher, I Love Mel, insisted the product is aimed at adults - despite a slogan on the book’s cover describing it as 'The COOL colouring-in book for good colourer-inners (as well as beginners). The infamous scene from The Shining in which Jack Nicholson hacks through a bathroom door is in the book . The stuff of nightmares: An American Werewolf In London is one of the horror films featured . A Clockwork Orange, which tells the story of a dystopian nightmare in a future society, is also pictured . Mel Elliott, who runs I Love Mel, said her book was designed for adults rather than children. She said: 'Firstly and most importantly, my products are not aimed at kids. They are a contemporary, pop-culture inspired range that are aimed at playful grown-ups. 'I was unaware that Tesco were a stockist as a separate distribution company deal with the wholesale of my products. 'The front cover features a drawing from the horror movie Psycho, in which a woman is stabbed to death in the shower. 'I believe that this one image is a fairly large clue that this is not a book aimed at children. 'However, it does state on Tesco’s website that my products are aimed at five to eight year olds, which is an error on their part.' The product has now been removed from Tesco’s website.

"There are obvious difficulties in wearing a blanket in the street. For example, a few days ago I met a very fashionable person wrapped in one in the country, and was not alone in assuming she was recuperating from something nasty. Or, at worst, people might think you’d slept in a doorway and got up to stretch your legs. However, absurd as it sounds, the blanket (or poncho, drape, cape, wrap, maxi scarf or whatever you want to call it) is having a moment. Burberry’s, thick, 15 per cent cashmere, 85 per cent wool blankets in yellow, blue and red — and costing nearly £900 — were the toast of their autumn/winter show this year, and looked rather fetching (not a hard task, admittedly) on Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Cara Delevingne. To someone like me who loves their bed and hates getting out of it, wandering around draped in a blanket is a good halfway house. There are drawbacks, however: with no toggles anywhere, they can slide off; you can’t run in them, and you have to drink coffee extremely carefully, in case your blanket slips off, taking your mug with it. But can they really be an acceptable form of outerwear? And as they are after all only blankets, would anyone actually be able to tell the difference between this autumn’s designer creations and a £25 one from Ikea? Scroll down for video . VERSATILE ZIG-ZAGS . Knitted wrap, £29.50, marksandspencer.com . This reliable M&S wrap is all Ribena and summer pudding colours, with a fringe. It’s easy to wear, with no special wrapping required — and as it’s knitted, its weight stops it from sliding off. You could tie it at the front if you needed your hands free. I looked a little like a tarot-card reader, but it’s pretty, and either bohemian or dressy depending what you wear it with. BEAT THE CHILLS . Check wool and cashmere blanket, £895, burberry.com . The original Burberry masterpiece that kicked off the blanket trend. This does feel very expensive, which is lucky because it is. It’s very thick — perhaps overly so for a transitional autumn day, but wonderful on a chilly, breezy one. As it’s heavy, it stays on better than most. STYLISH CHECKS . Blanket, £25, ikea.com . The utilitarian option. I have to admit that when draped by a stylist — I certainly couldn’t manage to make it look stylish myself — you might think this was designed for a person rather than a sofa. But it feels rough and scratchy. I got the sense that if I lay down in a London park, people might start parking their flasks and sandwiches on my back! CREATIVE COLOURS . Multi block poncho, £129, jigsaw-online.com . Jigsaw’s attempt is made of lovely fabric, with rough, blankety edges, and it’s in strong colours just like the Burberry one. However, there’s so much of it you could set up camp in it, so careful draping is required. I wouldn’t wear this one anywhere near an escalator. WARM AND COSY . Stripe blanket cape, £25, asos.com .

"A study by University of Chicago researchers suggests the difference between love and lust might be in the eyes after all. Specifically, where your date looks at you could indicate whether romance or passion is on the cards. The research found that eye patterns concentrate on a stranger's face if the viewer sees that person as a potential partner in romantic love, but the viewer gazes more at the other person's body if he or she is feeling sexual desire. University of Chicago researchers say the direction of a person's gaze can indicate their feelings for another when they first meet them (stock image shown). They found that where a person looked at another determined 'love or lust'. Students were asked to view photographs of strangers in the study . The report was published in the journal Psychological Science . If you want to improve your health while giving your love life a boost, try a cup of moringa tea with your breakfast. Moringa, or ‘miracle tree’, is being hailed as a superfood that not only increases energy levels and boosts the immune system, but can also be an aphrodisiac. Native to North Africa and the Himalayan mountains in northwestern India, the plant has traditionally been used to boost sexual desire and to treat male sexual disorders. A recent study in the International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences found that it enhanced sexual behaviour in rats. It’s also known to contain chemical compounds called saponins which have been shown in other studies to support libido and levels of the sex hormone testosterone. Gram for gram, moringa has seven times the vitamin C found in oranges, four times the calcium of milk, four times the vitamin A of carrots, three times the potassium of bananas and three times the iron of spinach. Its tiny leaves are also high in protein, with twice the amount found in yoghurt. The plant, which can be taken as a tea, or in tablet, powder or oil format, is said to help the body recover after exercise, and is also rich in zeatin, a plant hormone which has an anti-ageing effect on skin cells. Lead author Stephanie Cacioppo of the University of Chicago said that although 'little is currently known about the science of love at first sight or how people fall in love, these patterns of response provide the first clues regarding how automatic attentional processes, such as eye gaze, may differentiate feelings of love from feelings of desire toward strangers.' The automatic judgment of love or lust can apparently occur in as little as half a second, producing different gaze patterns. Previous research by Cacioppo has shown that different networks of brain regions are activated by love and sexual desire. In this study, the team performed two experiments to test visual patterns in an effort to assess two different emotional and cognitive states that are often difficult to disentangle from one another - romantic love and sexual desire (lust). Male and female students from the University of Geneva viewed a series of black-and-white photographs of persons they had never met. In part one of the study, participants viewed photos of young, adult heterosexual couples who were looking at or interacting with each other. In part two, participants viewed photographs of attractive individuals of the opposite sex who were looking directly at the camera or viewer. None of the photos contained nudity or erotic images. In both experiments, participants were placed before a computer and asked to look at different blocks of photographs and decide as rapidly and precisely as possible whether they perceived each photograph or the persons in the photograph as eliciting feelings of sexual desire or romantic love. The researchers analysed eye movements and found patterns in how subjects experienced feelings of romantic love or sexual desire. In this illustrated image a viewer's eyes fixate mostly on the faces of a couple that evokes feelings of romantic love. Looking at other parts of the body apparently indicates feelings of lust . The study found no significant difference in the time it took subjects to identify romantic love versus sexual desire, which shows how quickly the brain can process both emotions, the researchers believe. But analysis of the eye-tracking data from the two studies revealed marked differences in eye movement patterns, depending on whether the subjects reported feeling sexual desire or romantic love. People tended to visually fixate on the face, especially when they said an image elicited a feeling of romantic love. However, with images that evoked sexual desire, the subjects' eyes moved from the face to fixate on the rest of the body. The effect was found for male and female participants. 'By identifying eye patterns that are specific to love-related stimuli, the study may contribute to the development of a biomarker that differentiates feelings of romantic love versus sexual desire,' said co-author John Cacioppo, director of the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience. 'An eye-tracking paradigm may eventually offer a new avenue of diagnosis in clinicians' daily practice or for routine clinical exams in psychiatry and/or couple therapy.'","University of Chicago researchers say direction of gaze can indicate feelings .

"Beautiful women and handsome men dance around a set of London town in their flexible yet stylish Burberry macs, accompanied by guardsmen in bearskins and an angelic boy who just happens to be Romeo Beckham, probably the only famous 12-year-old in Britain. Little expense has been spared in the Burberry Christmas advert. And why not? The brand has unquestionably become Britain’s premier luxury label, its only superbrand. With its designer Christopher Bailey at the helm as CEO, Burberry is London's answer to Chanel. Its fashion shows have become the biggest, starriest event at London fashion week. Even in a weakening market for luxury goods, revenues rose seven per cent in the past six months to more than £1 billion. Scroll down for video . Back in style: Romeo Beckham wears the £315 'icon' cashmere scarf in Burberry’s distinctive camel, black, white and red check . Back in 2002, the design had been dubbed 'chav check' after it was embraced by far from A-list stars like actress Danniella Westbrook . Back in 2009, shares hovered below 600p — now they are around 1,400p. Kate Middleton, Gwyneth Paltrow and Keira Knightley are among the stars who wear Burberry — the deluxe, catwalk Burberry Prorsum line, the rainwear and bags. In the current advert, Romeo Beckham wears the £315 ‘icon’ cashmere scarf in Burberry’s distinctive camel, black, white and red check. Hard to believe that it was only a decade ago that the brand seemed in crisis and that check was less icon, more albatross. Far too widespread for its own good, it had become known as ‘chav check’. Immediately recognisable — and affordable, on items such as a £50 baseball cap — it was accessible luxury that became far too accessible. Worse still, it was easy to copy and spawned an industry of counterfeits. Real or fake, it was on everything from bikinis to bags, favoured by football hooligans and — most spectacularly — worn head to toe (including toddler and buggy) by EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook in 2002. Following in her footsteps: Romeo is making waves in the fashion world, just like his mother, Victoria . Magic dust: Plenty of it is being sprinkled on Burberry whose shares are on the up . It is hard to remember another single photograph doing a brand so much damage. In the words of social commentator Peter York, author of the Official Sloane Ranger Handbook: ‘It was associated with people who did bad stuff, who went wild on the terraces. Quite a lot of people thought that Burberry would be worn by the person who mugged them.’ Some venues banned anyone wearing it, so entrenched was its association with anti-social behaviour. It had come a very long way from its respectable beginnings . Yet how ironic it is that the brand’s slow limp back to respectability has been matched, step-for-step by the very family whose pint-sized representative is being seen as a symbol of salvation. Not so long ago Romeo’s mother Victoria Beckham, although not viewed with quite as much derision as Danniella Westbrook, was far from being a fashion icon. A WAG and popstar known for her fake tan, fake breasts and fake hair extensions she was the very sort of person Burberry didn’t want to wear its merchandise. Golden touch: It's thanks to Christoper Bailey, centre, that stars like Kate Beckinsale, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are keen to be seen in Burberry . Now named Britain’s top entrepreneur, with a style that’s more Vogue than football terrace, the choice of her son to front the Burberry Christmas campaign is fitting indeed. The brand was founded by Thomas Burberry, teetotaller and devout Baptist, in 1856. He went on to invent gabardine, the waterproof fabric that revolutionised rainwear. Roald Amundsen went to the South Pole and Ernest Shackleton to Antarctica, in Burberry. Then the War Office commissioned the company to design the ‘trench coat’, worn by officers in World War I. In an early case of celebrity endorsement, Lord Kitchener declared himself a fan and civilians started wearing them after the war. Burberry made aviation-wear and skiwear but remained a quiet London firm until Rose Marie Bravo, an American executive, took over in 1997. She raised its profile, expanded into America, commissioned an advertising campaign starring Kate Moss in 1999 and, most significantly of all, hired Christopher Bailey on the design team in 2001. Approved by style icons: The Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Keira Knightley in Burberry coats . By now it was at the height of its ‘chav’ popularity, most pertinently illustrated by the Danniella Westbrook overload. The brand had become a victim of its own success. In luxury, ubiquity is the death knell; luxury is exclusive or it isn’t luxury at all. The idea of anyone being able to resuscitate that check into anything remotely desirable seemed as likely as Burberry opening a shop on the moon. It was vulgar, vulgar, vulgar. But the firm refused to admit defeat. Steps were taken to stop the rot — the caps went out of production, and the use of check was reduced across the board. In 2004 Bailey was promoted to Creative Director. Burberry was becoming a more serious player. In 2006, a turning point came in the form of another American CEO with an impressive CV, Angela Ahrendts. She arrived and, together with Bailey, performed the remarkable feat of carving out a strategy to move Burberry firmly back off the backs of the undesirables into the ‘hot’ zone, using a combination of design skill, marketing savvy and business sense. Even now, the fashion set are still in awe of how they turned things round. One leading magazine editor told me: ‘It’s very hard to know quite how Bailey does it. He runs a design team, a huge company — most fashion brands are like that — and he edits it all. ‘Like Tom Ford, for whom he worked at Gucci, he knows the importance of being on message and on brand. The shows bang one point home again and again — 70 girls wearing the same thing. It’s about one big idea. Plus, the models are acceptably, immediately appealing, like the music he chooses. Or Romeo Beckham. He’s really good at marketing.’ Star-studded front row: The Burberry show is the must-see event at London Fashion Week . The answer seems to lie in the fusion of design and business strategy. In the bad old days, due to complicated global licensing, different stores in the world sold a whole load of different products, at different prices, adding up to what Ahrendts called ‘just a lot of stuff’. Companies she admired such as Starbucks and Apple (where she is now a senior vice president) offered the same experience in any store. She decided to ‘centralise the design’ under Christopher Bailey, who became Chief Creative Officer in 2009. From then on every single design decision was to be approved by him. This ‘control freak’ philosophy meant that the Willy-Wonka-ish figure of Bailey could prevail in all areas of his fabulous fashion factory. Son of a carpenter and an M&S window dresser, Bailey is a famously polite, softly-spoken Yorkshireman with an iron will and a sharp sense for the vagaries of fashion, in fabrics, hemlines, or mood. After his promotion, every new Burberry shop offered the same stock, at the same price. The store design — mirrors, warm wood, videos — was uniform. He decided to concentrate on the brand’s heritage, or the good bits, anyway. The check was further reduced. Burberry would do what it did best: trench coats. They would also come home. The company moved its fashion shows back to London from Milan in 2009 and became a giant fish in a smaller pond, a move that gave it a clearer identity and more publicity. So far so good. But vitally, there were two more strands to the brand’s resurgence. Digital innovation, and wearability. Models, from left, Jourdan Dunn, Edie Campbell and Cara Delevingne have raised the brand's profile . Bailey has the golden gift of knowing just what will take off on the streets, and spreads the word. It wasn’t just that they were the first brand to live-stream their fashion shows in 2010, or to let customers order from the runway, or to garner followers on social media. It was that they deliberately targeted what Ahrendts called ‘millennials’ — young customers — because they believed their competitors were ignoring them. The youth drive was important because in emerging markets such as China, the age of the luxury goods consumer is much lower than it is in the UK. But it had a happy side-effect. Rather than alienating the older, more traditional customer in the West, it ensured they perceived the brand as edgy and exciting. A Burberry gabardine jacket was worn by George Mallory on his ill-fated attempt on Mount Everest in 1924 . One of the many mysteries of fashion is that you would think an expensive luxury brand, which wants to sell to the highly lucrative 40 and 50-something market, would make sure that it offers clothes that are not too short, or too revealing. Bafflingly, most designer fashion labels miss this obvious fact. But part of Bailey’s brilliance was that while there was always enough edge — sharp leather jackets, buckles, trims, glimmery fabric — his clothes didn’t frighten the horses. Like Karl Lagerfeld’s designs for Chanel, Burberry offered high fashion that almost any middle-class, middle-aged woman could wear. They never neglected the core customer — in London, a busy, affluent 30 to 60-year-old woman or man. Expansion continued apace, more stores opened with well-trained staff; online sold bespoke trench coats in endless varieties; Burberry Beauty was launched. This year, as Ahrendts departed for Apple, Bailey became CEO as well as Chief Creative Officer. His first Christmas advert seems sure-footed and accessible. It a sign of Bailey’s supreme confidence that even the once-dreaded check is back in the game. No wonder Romeo Beckham is dancing. He represents sweet victory after a chequered history.","The brand has unquestionably become Britain's premier luxury label .

"Norway's stunning new passport design has just been unveiled and it has mastered the art of Scandinavian minimalism. Created by Neue Design Studio, the packaging features clean lines, a red embossed cover, and even secret images of the Northern Lights. When placed under a UV lamp, the gorgeous landscape lights up before your eyes. Minimalist chic: Norway has just unveiled its new passports, designed by Oslo design studio, Neue . The new designs were the winning entry to the National Police Directorate's competition . When the Neue Design Studio design is placed under UV light, secret images of the Northern Lights appear . The passport will have a red cover, unless you are a diplomat, in which case, you will receive a blue version. Immigrants will be issued a pale gray design. The new designs were an entry in the National Police Directorate's competition to 'find a unique concept with excellent design qualities and a theme that is widely accepted.' The hope was also that the new design would increase security of Norwegian passports, ID cards, and other travel documents. 'Nature has always been an essential part of the Norwegian identity and tradition, as well as being a  key fundament to our welfare,' said the design team. 'The landscape with its vast variation from the south to the north, is the starting point for the design concept. 'The basis for the winning entry is the concept of The Norwegian Landscape.' The hope was also that the new design would increase security of Norwegian passports, ID cards, and other travel documents . Though the design will be slightly adjusted and tweaked on the basis of technical and safety considerations, the final result will be presented soon. The jury, speaking of their decision to crown Neue Design Studio the winners, said: 'It illustrates the Norwegian identity and makes sure the passport will be viewed as a document of high value.' 'It will be relevant for many years to come and has clear user benefits. 'The design is attractive and stylish, the colours are subtle and the abstraction of the landscapes are exciting. 'The jury appreciates the simplicity of the solution.'","Created by Neue Design Studio as entry for national competition .

"The heads of Americans are changing - and rapidly - skulls are getting bigger and faces are getting longer and narrower. Within just 150 years, American heads have grown in volume by roughly the volume of a tennis ball. The survey of 1500 skulls compared skulls from the mid-1800s to skulls from the Eighties - and the shape is definitely changing. Are Americans evolving? The researchers don't know - the changing head shapes (found in samples of white Americans) could also be due to better nutrition or racial mixing. Conan O'Brien: Within just 150 years, American heads have grown in volume by roughly the volume of a tennis ball . ‘The varieties of changes that have swept American life make determining an exact cause an endlessly complicated proposition,’ said Lee Jantz. ‘It likely results from modified growth patterns because of better nutrition, lower infant and maternal mortality, less physical work, and a breakdown of former ethnic barriers to marriage. Which of these is paramount we do not know.’ The researchers found that the average height from the base to the top of the skull in men has increased by 0.3 inches. The skull size has grown by 200 cubic centimeters, a space equivalent to a tennis ball. In women, the corresponding increases are seven millimeters and 180 cubic centimeters. Skull height has increased 6.8 percent since the late 1800s, while body height has increased 5.6 percent and femur length has only increased about 2 percent. Also, skull-height has continued to change whereas the overall heightening has recently slowed or stopped. Sarah Jessica Parker: Skull height has increased 6.8 percent since the late 1800s, while body height has increased 5.6 percent and femur length has only increased about 2 percent . The scientists also noted changes that illustrate our population is maturing sooner. This is reflected in the earlier closing of a separation in the bone structure of the skull called the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, which in the past was thought to fuse at about age twenty. Richard Jantz and Natalie Shirley, an adjunct assistant professor in the FAC, have found the bone is fusing much earlier — 14 for girls and 16 for boys. America's obesity epidemic is the latest development that could affect skeletal shape but its precise effects are unclear. ‘This might affect skull shape by changing the hormonal environment, which in turn could affect timing of growth and maturation,’ said Richard Jantz. ‘We know it has an effect on the long bones by increasing muscle attachment areas, increasing arthritis at certain joints, especially the knee, and increasing the weight bearing capacity.’ The research only assessed Americans of European ancestry because they provided the largest sample sizes to work with.","Survey of 1500 skulls from mid-1800s to 1980s .

"A drug cartel lieutenant has been arrested over a series of firebomb attacks on Mexican potato-chip company Sabritas, a subsidiary of U.S. food giant PepsiCo. The gang-related bombings are believed to be the first time a multinational company has been targeted in Mexico's 5½-year-long drug war. Experts suggested that the attack may be linked to the company's apparent refusal to hand over protection money to the gangs which have terrorised local residents and businesses. Attack: Sabritas, owned by Pepsi, was targeted in a series of firebombs on Friday and Saturday . Five Sabritas warehouses and vehicle lots were attacked on Friday and Saturday in the Mexican states of Michoacan and Guanajuato. Witnesses in one case described armed, masked men who tossed firebombs and torched dozens of the company's distribution trucks and some warehouses. Gerardo Gutierrez, president of Mexico's Business Coordinating Council, said on Monday that it was 'an isolated case' of the kind of extortion that gangs have previously practiced with small and medium-sized businesses. He called on authorities to act immediately to prevent the practice from spreading. 'What we cannot allow is for this kind of isolated case to become generalized,' Mr Gutierrez said. 'The authorities have to take forceful action.' In a speech to an anti-crime conference on Monday, President Felipe Calderon said drug cartels threaten growth and development and called them 'an obstacle to prosperity because they attack companies large and small.' Up in flames: The attacks are believed to be linked to the firm's refusal to pay protection money to cartels . Bombed: Five different sites in two Mexican states belonging to the company were affected . The state attorney general's office in Guanajuato confirmed on Monday that several suspects had been detained in the attacks there, and that one was identified as a lieutenant of the Knights Templar drug cartel. Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former official in Mexico's CISEN intelligence agency, said it was the first attack he could recall against a transnational company in Mexico. Even in Mexico's most violent city, Ciudad Juarez, the warring drug gangs have largely left alone the many foreign-operated assembly plants known as maquiladoras. 'In Ciudad Juarez, they practically never tried to blackmail the maquiladoras,' Mr Hope said. 'They focused more on small businesses... they are easier targets, and with an industrial firm, one doesn't know exactly who to blackmail.' In a statement issued on Sunday, PepsiCo said five distribution centres were damaged, but added that no one was injured in the attacks. Tackling the blaze: Firefighters battled to put out the fires, which have led to a number of arrests . The company appeared to respond to emails that circulated in Michoacan, home of the Knights Templar gang, suggesting the attacks were revenge for the unproven allegation that prosecutors used Sabritas' extensive fleet of delivery trucks to gather intelligence. 'We repeat that in accordance with our code of conduct, all of our operations are carried out in the current regulatory framework and our vehicles and facilities are used exclusively to carry our products to our customer and clients,' the company said. Mr Hope said such a spying scenario sounded unlikely, if not impossible. Sabritas employs more than 70,000 people and has a nationwide delivery fleet of about 14,500 trucks that are a common sight even in the most dangerous and remote parts of Mexico. He added that the attacks may not represent a new stage in drug gang extortions, but rather stem from the peculiar characteristics of the Knights Templar, a pseudo-religious cartel that split from Michoacan's La Familia cartel in 2011. The Knights Templar organisation is a relatively local, minor player in drug smuggling, trafficking mainly in methamphetamines and marijuana. With little access to the more lucrative cocaine and heroin business, cartel members have sought to raise money from other criminal activities. 'The Knights Templar have been more aggressive in their use of extortion and alternative sources [of income] than practically any other cartel, except the Zetas,' Mr Hope said. The hyperviolent Zetas cartel was formed along Mexico's Gulf coast by deserters from an elite military unit and has been linked to the extortion and kidnapping of civilians.","First time a multinational firm has been targeted in long-running drug wars .

"The picture in the papers of a resplendent Emma Thompson, dressed for an awards ceremony in glorious technicolour, was the thing that really got to me. Frankly, it made me quite envious as I went to my own wardrobe to get ready for work and found the familiar row of black tops, black trousers and a few scarves in muted colours. They have been my uniform since C Day - the day I was sent home after the operation to excise my breast cancer and entire right breast. The grief I went through during that awful period eight years ago was all-consuming. My mother died the day I was diagnosed and was cremated four days after my mastectomy. I struggled to be there to send her on her way. Lost confidence: Jenni in bright colours (left) before cancer and in black today . My father followed her a mere six months later when I was in the midst of chemotherapy. So black was an entirely appropriate colour for the circumstances in which I found myself. I remember my consultant, Professor Nigel Bundred, saying at an early check-up: 'We'll know when you're beginning to recover. You'll start wearing colours again and brighten up your make-up. It's generally the first sign.' But it hasn't happened. I was never really the type to have Emma Thompson's confidence and go out in a vibrant combination of oranges, reds and pinks. But, tucked at the back of my wardrobe - waiting for the day I regain whatever confidence that terrible time of my life seems to have destroyed - there are pinks and reds and my favourite turquoise blue. Often, as I prepare to get dressed in the morning, I think about going for it. 'Come on, you're well, brighten up', I mutter to myself. But still I find myself walking out of the front door swathed from top to bottom in comforting black. The best friend of one of my sons got married a couple of months ago. The venue was in the middle of countryside around Bath. The weather was glorious. Dozens of women, young and old, flitted about like radiant multi-coloured butterflies. I did not. Dark days: Jenni lost her hair after chemotherapy to treat her breast cancer . Yet, I was more suitably attired for a funeral than the nuptials of a young man I've loved like a son since he was a tiny tot. I couldn't wait to leave. That celebration of youth and perfection and a future full of hope felt nearly too much to bear. I've begun to dread these gorgeous summer days, knowing I won't want to go to parties where everyone else is dressed in skimpy, colourful attire while I, like some dour middle Eastern widow, cower in a corner, feeling hot and dull in my day-to-day uniform of black. I am, though, not alone in this. Of all the friends who've shared my experience of diagnosis and treatment - and they are legion - only one displays the same taste in high fashion, bright as can be, that she enjoyed BBC: Before Breast Cancer. ""The clothes we wear seem to be partly an exercise in denial and partly the concealment of the evidence that we can no longer trust our bodies to be as healthy or as attractive as they once were... "" Let's call her Jane. She's a couple of years older than me, was diagnosed a couple of years after me - immediately following her marriage to a man with whom she'd fallen passionately in love. It seemed such a terrible blow when she was so deliriously happy, but she handled her treatment like a military operation, planning full reconstruction of her lost breast as soon as it was feasible and making sure she had a top-class plastic surgeon to do it. Jane now proudly boasts two pretty identical breasts - one completely natural, the other formed from muscles in her back - and wears clothes that make her stand out in any crowd. She even sports a bikini on holiday. Then there's Mary. Like me she's reluctant to go for the full Monty on the reconstruction front. I think we both felt we'd had enough serious surgery once the mastectomy was done, to put up with any more. We both had implants put into the mutilated side and wear a bra prosthesis to match it up. Unlike Jane, though, we don't have a perfectly reconstructed side, just a bit of a lump and unsightly scar. Like me, Mary spends most of her time in black or grey. I assume that Jane's enthusiasm for wanting to return to the woman she was, and the time and pain she was prepared to invest in it, came as a result of being in the throes of a new passion and being determined not to disappoint. For the rest of us, the clothes we wear seem to be partly an exercise in denial and partly the concealment of the clear evidence that we can no longer trust our bodies to be as healthy or as attractive as they once were. I remember dress designer, Nicole Farhi, saying that her style - clothes in unobtrusive colours that loosely skim the body - came from her days as a girl in France when the way you looked was of paramount importance. Contrast: Jenni wore pink in 1999 when she was awarded her OBE, left, when she was made a Dame in 2011, she wore black . Nicole realised then, she said, that most women don't have what’s judged to be the perfect physique, and merely require clothes with which they can conceal their bodies and make themselves seem to disappear. This seems to be what's going on with the attire of friends who've had breast cancer. If women who've suffered no mutilation are keen to disappear, how much worse must it be for those of us to whom the scalpel - albeit to save our lives - has done its worst. Black became the colour of mourning during the Roman Empire . And it is the friends who've had breast cancer who seem to fall into this pattern most often. We seem to be saying, 'even when faced with incontrovertible evidence something truly disfiguring has occurred, deny it, deny it, deny it and hide it away.' Friends who've had other forms of cancer seem to suffer less from this belief that you are not the woman you once were. With breast cancer, the feeling is that the very part of us that once defined our femininity - whether it was our sexual attractiveness or our ability to feed our children - has been brutally taken away. This is demonstrated by two photographs that I see every time I walk up the stairs at my home. The first was taken in 1999 outside Buckingham Palace just after I'd been awarded the OBE. I'm with my partner, David, my mother, Win, and my younger son, Charlie, and I'm wearing a lovely pink silk suit and smiling brightly. The second was taken in 2011, five years after C Day, after I was made a Dame. My mother is no longer with us. David looks much the same and both my now grown-up sons proudly flank me. This time I am in a black hat, black jacket, black top, black trousers and black shoes and I'm smiling, but somewhat wanly. I see a different woman from the one before. I'd like to see her in the pink, but am not sure I ever will.","Jenni has worn dark shades since having breast cancer treatment .

"The husband of the mother sentenced to death in Sudan for refusing to renounce her Christian faith has spoken for first time of how the secret police tried to beat them up as they attempted to flee the African country. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Daniel Wani said that he told Meriam Ibrahim: ‘Don’t resist’ when the force dubbed the ‘Agents of Fear’ intercepted them and their two young children at the airport in Sudan’s capital Khartoum. Daniel said that the experience was 'terrifying' and that they were herded into a room whilst their lawyers were battered and forced to run for their lives. Daniel Wani said that he told Meriam Ibrahim: 'Don¿t resist' when the force dubbed the 'Agents of Fear' intercepted them and their two young children at an airport (file photo) Meriam, seen leaving Italy for New Hampshire, was forced to deliver her baby with her legs shackled . He also revealed that he was initially banned from being at Meriam’s side whilst she gave birth to their baby Maya, two months, inside the prison where she was being held. It was only after he kicked up a fuss that they finally let him in - only to see her shackled to the floor in leg chains as she gave birth. Daniel spoke out to MailOnline, his first interview at length, after he, Meriam, Maya and their son Martin, two, finally arrived in Manchester, New Hampshire to begin their new life in the US. Daniel said that the family had been through nearly a year of hell after the case against Meriam began in August last year. She was jailed in September and in May was sentenced to hanging and 100 lashes for adultery and apostasy for marrying Daniel as they are both Christians. Meriam’s father was a Muslim so a strict Islamic judge said she had broken the law and must die. In a softly spoken but determined voice, Daniel explained that he will need time to recover from the ordeal but that he is ‘so happy’ to be home. Meriam however will take longer to get over her trauma, despite her astonishing inner strength and grace. She says: ‘Thank you’ when told of the campaigning by MailOnline to free her but seems shy and wary of strangers. Behind her smile is a pain that may never entirely leave her. Safe and sound: Meriam Ibrahim was sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her Christian faith . Together again: Ibrahim and Wani are cheered in New Hampshire July 31. She was jailed in September and in May was sentenced to hanging and 100 lashes for adultery and apostasy for marrying Daniel as they are both Christians . Home: Ibrahim hugs relatives upon her arrival in New Hampshire in this July 31 file photo. She was held in Sudan for 10 months . Among the most chilling episodes in their ordeal was after Meriam had initially been freed on June 26th - only to be arrested the next day at the airport in Khartoum as they tried to leave. Daniel said that their papers were ‘clean’ but that they were stopped anyway. He said: ‘We got the papers. We got permission to travel through the VIP area. I don't know why they did that, it’s stupid. ‘They made a mistake and wanted to cover it up and they didn’t have a stop order. ‘When they came to us I said do you have a stop order? ‘They said no and they started to use force, they just threw the lawyers out of the airport, beat them. ‘It was terrifying, secret service personnel, national security. It’s a lot. ‘They took us, when they started to use force against my wife I said to her don’t resist and just go. We had an interview at the airport. ‘We went in. I stayed there five minutes or 10 minutes and I had a number to call somebody and I told them. ‘They had to cover up what they did, making this decision.’ Meriam, 27, a doctor, had been pregnant the entire time she was inside the grim Omdurman Women’s Prison in Khartoum and gave birth to Maya on May 27. Until then Daniel had been denied access to her at all but when he heard his daughter was about to arrive, he demanded to be let him. He said: ‘They tried to stop me but I wanted to visit her. ‘The day she was born they didn’t allow us to see her because she had the chains on her legs. ‘They were scared that if I went in and saw her give birth in chains I would talk about it. ‘When we went there in the morning they said there’s an order and you can’t see her. After that we went to high level in the prison department to get permission. Speaking out: Daniel Wani, husband of Meriam Ibrahim, is seen speaking to the press in this July 31 file photo . Meriam's release came after international condemnation from the governments of the UK, the US, Canada and the Netherlands . ‘They tried to say it was an order from high, and I said who? Do you mean the minister of the interior? I managed to get in there for the birth. After that they allowed me in and let me see her twice a week. She was wearing the chains when she gave birth. ‘I kept telling them I wanted to have the birth out of prison, I could take her to the hospital where she gave birth to Martin. At first they said OK then they refused.’ Meriam’s release came after international condemnation from the governments of the UK, the US, Canada and the Netherlands. More than half a million people signed numerous petitions and British Prime Minister David Cameron called her treatment ‘barbaric’. In the end the Italian government, which has good relations with Sudan, brokered a deal under which she would fly to Rome before going on to the US. They spent a week recouperating in Italy, having the chance to be together as a family under normal conditions for the first time. Meriam also realised one of her lifelong dreams after she met Pope Francis and he gave her his blessing. Daniel said that whilst Meriam was still locked up he was angry but kept it inside him so as not to give any of the guards or officials an excuse to treat him badly. He said: ‘Having me there must have helped. From the beginning if I wasn’t there even the media would not know what was going on. 'They would have just killed her and no-one would have known. Even the police would have beat her.’ The Italians offered to let the family stay in their country permanently but for Daniel, home was always going to be America, where he is a naturalised citizen. He said: ‘It feels real. It’s good to be home. ‘I was born in Sudan, but I tell people I'm from here (New Hampshire)’. Daniel’s brother Gabriel said that Daniel and Meriam have been meeting with officials from the State Department who have come up from Washington, D.C. to speak with them. He believes Meriam will be granted leave to remain for the time being with a view to granting her citizenship in the future.","The husband of the mother sentenced to death in Sudan for refusing to renounce her Christian faith has spoken for first time in an exclusive interview with MailOnline .

"A set of rare 'mono mono' twins born holding hands in Ohio are still inseparable six months later. Jenna and Jillian Thistlethwaite were born May 9 sharing an amniotic sac and placenta at Akron General Medical Center, in the state's northwest. Despite fears for their survival, they are now healthy and strong - and still feel most comfortable when holding hands. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Inseparable: Six-month-old twins Jenna and Jillian Thistlethwaite are most comfortable holding hands . Identical: Jenna (pictured) and Jillian were rare mono mono twins who shared an amniotic sac . Stronger: Jillian (pictured) and her sister now weigh 13 pounds after coming out at just five pounds in May . Delighted: Their parents Sarah (left) and Bill (right), plus older brother Jaxon, two, (left) are ecstatic . Their closeness is something of a test for their parents Sarah and Bill, who struggle to tell them apart. 'Actually Jillian, the way you could tell her from her sister, she is a little bit smaller, about a pound difference between them and Jillian has a birthmark above her left eye and eyelid,' Bill Thistlethwaite told WJW-TV. Sarah added: 'I had a lot of anxiety at the beginning, especially, when I found out they were mono mono twins - just whether or not they were going to survive.' She spent nearly a month with the identical girls in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit before they could head home to Orrville in northeast Ohio. Sarah Thistlethwaite holds her twin daughters, Jenna and Jillian, after her delivery of the monoamniotic twin girls at Akron General Hospital in Akron, Ohio. The rare twins were allowed home a month after their birth . Father: Bill Thistlethwaite lovingly gazes at his new daughter on May 9 this year near Orrville, Ohio . Growing girls: Mother Sarah Thistlethwaite had been placed on a 57-day bed rest before she gave birth . The twins' rare birth condition is called monoamnioitic, or 'mono mono'. Doctors say they occur in about one of every 10,000 pregnancies. Jenna was born first at . four pounds, two ounces and 17 inches, with Jillian following 48 seconds . later at three pounds, 13 ounces and 17.5 inches.

The rare birth conditions happens in about one in every 10,000 pregnancies . Jenna and Jillian were delivered by Caesarean section  at Akron General Medical Center and were holding hands when presented to Sarah and Bill in the delivery room. 'They’re already best friends,' Sarah told the paper after the birth. 'I can’t believe they were holding hands. That’s amazing.' Now, they are still incredibly close. 'When the whole thing happened it was absolutely amazing for me to see something like that,' Bill gushed. 'Three kids was what I had always said, absolutely.

"Struggling under the weight of packed bags from luxury stores including Prada and Louis Vuitton, Amy Jiang pauses for breath. The glittering mall is doing a brisk trade, with queues thronging the popular shops and the most sought-after fashion items selling out fast. Giggling, Amy inspects her purchases, including a £1,010 bubblegum-pink Miu Miu cashmere sweater, a black Gucci cocktail purse costing £430, a £335 Vuitton shawl and a Prada robot key-chain costing a mere £115. After flying to London from Beijing for a few days, the 25-year-old hasn’t tagged on the lavish shopping spree as a holiday treat. This was why she came. Scroll down for video . Kirsty Du (left) and Han Zhun (right) at Westfield shopping centre stocking up on designer items . Like thousands of other Chinese nationals she is in the UK during Golden Week, China’s national anniversary holiday — and a full-on British shopping spree is how to celebrate. This year is London’s busiest Golden Week ever, with more than 200,000 Chinese estimated to visit, bringing a welcome boost of around half a billion pounds to our economy. Some might think Amy’s haul from the Westfield shopping centre in West London is a tasteless display of extravagance. But she’s keen to point out she’s sleeping on a friend’s sofa to save cash for shopping — and she’s visited High Street chain stores, too. Amy Jiang, 25, loves Prada and Louis Vuitton . The marketing student says: ‘Once a year there is nothing like a big mall experience to get all the luxury brands under one roof and go on a spree,’ she beams, proudly holding up her shopping bags like trophies. ‘It’s like being Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. ‘The brands my friends and I really love are Prada and Louis Vuitton. But we all love the British High Street, too, especially Topshop.’ This year, the People’s Republic of China celebrates its 65th anniversary, during which the whole nation gets three days paid holiday for Golden Week. Its government started the tradition in 1999 to boost domestic tourism, but since then it has become the fashion for the wealthier inhabitants to fly abroad. China’s economy has been booming in recent years. Its purchasing power is set to exceed that of the U.S. this year, and is on track to become the number one global economy by the early 2020s. In short, it has produced some seriously wealthy young things, eager to spend their cash. VisitBritain has set up a Great China Welcome Charter to train businesses on how to encourage Chinese visitors, with the aim of trebling numbers here by 2020. Last month, Chancellor George Osborne announced the UK would fund 25,000 tourist visas every year to boost numbers further still. Myf Ryan, director of marketing in the UK and Europe for Westfield, says that even before that announcement, China had become ‘the number one international market to visit Westfield London, particularly The Village — the luxury area of the mall. ‘Three years ago, it became evident that the Chinese market was rapidly becoming one of the strongest emerging markets, and it was at this point that Westfield introduced Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking concierges and translated the mall guides.’ China has become ‘the number one international market to visit Westfield London, particularly The Village — the luxury area of the mall,' according to its director or marketing Myf Ryan . Golden Week shopping in London this year is predicted to surge by 20 per cent. Unlike Middle Eastern shoppers — who make a similar annual splurge in the capital in the summer, nicknamed the Ramadan Rush — the Chinese don’t usually drive around in flash cars making outrageous displays of wealth. Instead, they’ll take public transport, or — in the case of those descending on Bicester Village, the discount luxury retailer in Oxfordshire — go by coach. But like the Middle Eastern tourists, they do spend unbelievable amounts of money. Golden Week is in full swing at Selfridges, where student Annie Leung has just bought five handbags — one Prada, two Burberry and two Louis Vuitton — costing a total of £7,000. Chancellor George Osborne announced the UK would fund 25,000 tourist visas every year to boost numbers further . The Burberry concession appears especially popular. ‘I’ll hold it for you if you like,’ says one canny assistant to a Chinese woman inspecting a £1,300 mac, adding, ‘but your size is going very quickly.’ It’s little wonder retailers refer to this Chinese custom as ‘The Great Wallets of China’. Westfield’s Cantonese-speaking concierge service is designed to cater to the every whim of its wealthy visitors. The concierge confirms the Chinese are distinct from other nations, with their own cultural mores: ‘They are very organised and plan their trip day by day, hour by hour. They have done their research, and brand-wise they know what’s on-trend. ‘The Chinese don’t want to draw attention to themselves, they are just here for the Western experience. They don’t need to be patronised. The idea they want lots of bowing is a myth. ‘We have hands-free shopping, where bags are discreetly taken away and delivered to hotels. But the Chinese don’t avail themselves of that service. They’d be embarrassed.’ Kirsty Du and Han Zhun from Beijing have spent two hours in the Louis Vuitton store in Westfield’s luxury Village area, examining every bag they could lay their hands on. They have bought two — a clutch and a wallet — and spent more than £3,000. They’re off to Gucci next. The Chinese seem to love the convenience of everything under one roof. Han Dan and Wei Jing, from Shanghai, have bought shirts in upmarket Hawes & Curtis and Thomas Pink. They’re just getting started. Student Dong Liang, 23, dressed casually in a lumberjack shirt and surrounded by bouncy female friends, takes more than an hour in exclusive jeweller Tiffany, choosing a diamond ring for his girlfriend back home. Going on a shopping spree is ‘like being Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman,' says student Amy Jiang . As his friends tease him about the purchase, he walks away crimson-faced with embarrassment, with the light blue bag in one hand and a carton of juice in the other. Westfield isn’t the only emporium cashing in. At top Cantonese restaurant Hakkasan, just off Oxford Street, there is a special Golden Week menu, with all the prices ending in eight — an auspicious number in China. Meanwhile, entire four-star hotels, such as the 300-room Dorsett in Shepherd’s Bush and the 400-room Corus in Hyde Park, have been taken over by Chinese tour operators. Harrods is a must-see destination for Chinese visitors, who can converse easily with the 100 Mandarin-speaking staff. Fred Huang, 23, is buying a Chanel handbag for his girlfriend, After discussing the purchase in his native tongue, Fred opts for the £3,000 black one rather than the yellow quilted version costing £2,990. Harrods, like many luxury stores, now takes the CUP or China Union Pay card, which allows Chinese customers to see and complete the transaction in their own currency. The visitors can also claim back VAT by filling in a form in-store. They then get 20 per cent of the price refunded to their card straight away. Smiling, Fred says: ‘It’s much cheaper here. Luxury goods are all more expensive in China. A Mercedes Benz, for example is three times the price.’ Xing Yuan, 19, a student from Shanghai, has bought two Tiffany rings for his girlfriend. His friend Ran Tao blithely explains why the young people of China can buy things beyond the reach of their British contemporaries. ‘The academic level in China is high, and people work very hard, so they earn a lot of money now,’ he says. The Chinese target a few brands — big global names such as Louis Vuitton, Dior or Prada, or British ‘heritage’ makes such as Burberry, Mulberry or Gieves & Hawkes. Tim Wang (left), and Mago Ma (right) from Shen Zhen, China, shopping at Westfield, Shepherds Bush, London . Originality is not the point. There is a group mentality, and buying something one’s peers didn’t recognise would be peculiar. So back at Selfridges the Chanel concession is fit to burst, while younger, more obscure designers whom British shoppers are so proud of ‘discovering’ get ignored. Coming out of the Hermes concession, I meet two students who have rushed straight from the airport, complete with their suitcases, so they wouldn’t miss a minute’s shopping. Lily Chang, 22, has already bought a bag in Louis Vuitton, underwear in Victoria’s Secret and a necklace in Tiffany. That’s more than £2,000 in 40 minutes — and she has barely made a dent on her shopping list. All over the store, there are eager Chinese spenders on the phone — calling home to refine an order from friends and family — or discussing goods quietly with each other. These eager shoppers touch everything. In Selfridges’ watch department, one Chinese man is mulling over a £60,000 black number by Panerai while another girl tries to choose between a white-strapped Jaeger LeCoultre and an IWC, both more than £10,000. Upstairs in luxury concession Celine, a Chinese woman is testing all the security-tagged bags for weight and examining them in every way. Nearby, every single person in Celine and Prada is Chinese. In the Burberry children’s shop, three female students excitedly discover they can fit into the bigger children’s sizes. Doug Hansi, 30, a company director from Beijing, is on a one-week shopping trip with his girlfriend Du Dou with an enviable budget of £10,000. ‘We’ll go to Regent Street and maybe Bicester Village,’ he says. ‘I’ll buy suits and maybe watches for my parents.’ Nicole Li, 25 from Hangzhou in Eastern China, has spent £1,350 on a Prada handbag. She says: ‘This is a new design you can’t find in China. I’m so happy with it.’ As Myf Ryan puts it: ‘The Chinese love luxury.’ And, of course, in London, luxury loves them right back.","Amy Jiang, 25, loves Prada and Louis Vuitton .

As part of a three-day celebration of the 110-year anniversary of the U.S. company that produces the 'hog', riders parked their bikes along the broad avenue that leads up to the Vatican. Engines were said to be still rumbling when the Mass started. During the homily, Francis cautioned that 'power and pleasure', among other things, lead to God being 'replaced by fleeting human idols which offer the intoxication of a flash of freedom, but in the end bring new forms of slavery and death.' On Wednesday, representatives of the motor company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, met the pope and gave him two Harley-Davidson Inc. motorcycles and a leather jacket.

"Lying in a casket on a velvet carpet, at first glance you could be forgiven for thinking Silvio Berlusconi had passed away. But in fact it's just a very realistic waxwork which pokes fun at the beleaguered former Italian premier and hints at his sins. Entitled Il Sogno degli Italiani' or 'The Dream of the Italians', the controversial artwork has been created by artists Antonio Garullo and Mario Ottocento, the first ever married gay couple who tied the knot in Amsterdam in 2002. 'The Dream of all Italians: A waxwork figure of Silvio Berlusconi lies in a casket on a red velvet carpet . A close up of the former Italian premier's smiling face. He has his eyes closed and his head is on a satin pillow . The name of the installation refers to what Berlusconi apparently called himself on the phone to one of his girlfriends, according to Italian media. The former prime minister, who is still very much alive at 75, is seen smiling as he lies in a glass coffin with his eyes closed. Bizarrely he is wearing giant Mickey Mouse slippers as he lies on a satin pillow in a double-breasted blue jacket. There is also one hand inside his unzipped trousers while the other hand rests on the History of Italy. Positioned in a shrine at the . Ferrajoli Palace, the shocking installation is available for all Italians to see and is just . yards from Berlusconi's former stomping ground, the Palazzo Chigi, the official residence of Italian prime . ministers. Mocking: The artists have positioned the politician with a hand down his trousers to poke fun at his reputation . Garullo and Ottocento said of their work: 'We put Berlusconi’s body into a glass . case to emphasise the personality cult that he has been creating for . all these years and which will possibly remain for years to come. 'At the . same time we put a screen between the contingent reality and historical . judgment. 'If Italians are ultimately ''a people of saints, poets, . seafarers'' then the arch-Italian Silvio is a worthy simulacrum of this . people'. Berlusconi stepped down as premier last November after failing to come up with convincing reforms to help Italy exit from the sovereign debt crisis. The last part of his term in office was marred with a constant stream of lurid revelations about his private life. The sleazy politician is currently embroiled in a high-profile court case after being accused of paying for sex with underage minor Karima El Mahroug, also . known as Ruby the Heartbreaker, in February 2010 when she was just 17-years-old. In Italy the age of consent is 14 but . paying a woman under 18 for sex is seen as prostitution with a minor . and punishable by up to three years in jail. Berlusconi's other hand is placed on a copy of the History of Italy. He's also wearing Mickey Mouse slippers . Prosecutors believe dozens of women were given money, cars and . jewellery in return for spending the night with him and in return for . attending his now infamous bunga bunga parties. The trial has already heard how women dressed as nuns and police officers before carrying out seductive pole dances for Berlusconi and two of his cronies. Berlusconi has insisted that nothing untoward happened at the parties which were simply 'elegant dinners' and belly dancer Miss El Mahroug, who he is accused of paying for under age sex with, has also insisted that nothing happened between them. The sex charge carries a maximum sentence of three years while abuse of office is punishable with 12 years in jail.",The title of the installation 'The Dream of All Italians' is what the former Italian premier called himself on the phone to one of his girfriends .
"In what looks like a cross between the fictional Iron Giant and a Transformer, this robotic beast could one day be juggling cars at an event near you. Former Nasa engineer Dan Granett has designed a 70ft (21 metres) tall robotic man capable of hurling heavy objects, namely the Volkswagen Beetle, at car rallies. Dubbed BugJuggler, Granett envisions a remote-controlled, towering droid that uses hydraulic cylinders to launch the vehicles into the air. Scroll down for video . Former Nasa engineer Dan Granett has designed a 70ft (21 metres) tall robotic man capable of juggling cars,  (illustration pictured) namely the Volkswagen Beetle. Dubbed BugJuggler, Granett envisions a towering droid that uses hydraulic cylinders to hurl cars into the air at car rallies . BugJuggler was developed by former Nasa engineer Dan Granett. It is a 70ft (21 metres) tall robot that uses hydraulic cylinders to hurl cars. The giant droid will use a diesel engine to generate hydraulic pressure. An operator located in the robot’s head will be able to control its motions using a haptic feedback connected to high-speed servo valves. It will be powered by hydraulic accumulators, or fluid storage batteries. Grannet is looking for $2.3million (£1.35 million) to fund the project. ‘BugJuggler represents a new frontier in robotic entertainment,’ explained Grannet. ‘Moving beyond the car crushing robots of the past century, BugJuggler will use 21st century technology to perform breathtaking feats, including juggling up to three cars simultaneously.’ According to Grannet’s designs, an operator located in the robot’s head will be able to control its motions using haptic feedback, connected to high-speed servo valves. It will be powered by hydraulic accumulators - storage batteries for hydraulic fluid - which will allow for the smooth movement needed for the BugJuggler to throw cars or other large, heavy objects. BugJuggler would also operate within a ‘safety radius’, in case a car is dropped. An operator located in the robot's head will be able to control its motions using haptic feedback. It will be powered by hydraulic accumulators - storage batteries for hydraulic fluid - which will allow for the smooth movement needed for the BugJuggler to throw cars (illustration pictured) or other large, heavy objects . BugJuggler looks similar to the Iron Giant (pictured) in the 1999 film of the same name. It was based on the 1968 story, Iron Man, by former British poet laureate Ted Hughes . Granett and his team are currently seeking investment for his project, estimated to cost $2.3 million (£1.3 million) The first stage of the BugJuggler project will be construction of a working 8ft (2.4 metre) tall single arm. proof-of-principle juggler, able to toss and catch a 250lb (113kg) mass. The finished version will need to be capable of holding, and throwing, a typical Volkswagen Beetle weighing 2,700lb (1,220kg). Granett was a technician at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and built mechanisms for experiments on space shuttle flights during the 1980s. He is a hydraulics expert and previously built a diesel and hydraulic vehicle used to move six tonne, 40ft (12 metre) sections of pipe up a tunnel in California. He also designed, built and operated the equipment for the in-flight fight scene in the James Bond movie The Living Daylights.

"Even a year after the birth of her second child, Amy Middleton says she looked as though she was still pregnant . A mother-of two who says she still looked pregnant a year after giving birth has lost three stone in four months - thanks to raspberry diet pills. Amy Middleton, 34, dreaded having to get dressed up after giving birth to her second child. She'd had no problem getting back to a size 10 after the birth of her first child, Archie, three years ago. But after having her daughter Hattie 18 months later, her 'mummy tummy' simply wouldn't shift. Instead, she remained at her peak weight of 13 stone for more than a year, despite trips to the gym three times a week. She believes she was a victim of . ‘second baby syndrome’ whereby it is far harder to shift excess fat from . the abdomen because a woman’s stomach muscles are weakened by the . rigours of giving birth in quick succession. Amy, who lives with her husband Tom and children in Southwick, near Brighton, said: ‘I had two children quite quickly. ‘I . had always prided myself on staying in shape and having a great figure . but after the second birth there was nothing I could do to shift my . mummy tummy. ‘My stomach muscles just weren’t . the same – I just didn’t have the power there to keep all the excess fat . tucked up. It was classic “second baby syndrome.” ‘I think your body changes so much by having children so quickly together.’ Mrs Middleton lost three stone in four months while taking the Forza Raspberry Ketone diet pills . She added: ‘It was also hard to be really disciplined when I had two small kids to look after. ‘I would be snacking quite a bit during the day because there wasn’t time always to eat healthily. ‘My stomach was still protruding and I . was not at all happy with my figure. I couldn’t bear to go on nights . out because I feared someone at a bar or club would say, “When is the . baby due?” – even though I’d given birth nearly a year before. ‘All my friends would still be wearing their tight going-out clothes and I was wearing loose baggy tops to cover my tummy. ‘I didn’t feel sexy at all. I started to get really depressed and feared that I might not ever get my figure back again.’ Amy had read about how Kim Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey had both used Raspberry Ketone diet pills to keep in shape in the U.S. Raspberry ketones are fragrant compounds that occur naturally in raspberries and a number of other fruits. Before taking the pills (left) Amy dreaded going out in case people thought she was still pregnant. Now (right), she is confident enough to pose in a bikini . After taking the pills Amy felt sufficiently confident to wear a bikini while on a family holiday in Egypt . They were hailed as a ‘miracle’ diet cure after being featured on the popular U.S. medical show Dr Oz – and immediately sold out across the U.S. and Canada. They are said to work by suppressing the appetite and giving users an energy rush through caffeine which increases resting metabolism - allowing users to burn more calories even when they are not exercising. It is believed the pills may also boost levels of a hormone called adiponectin, which regulates metabolism. Higher levels of this hormone are associated with fewer fat stores. Amy, who took Forza Raspberry Ketones, claims they had an immediate effect and within four months of taking them she had shifted her dreaded ‘mummy tummy’ and lost three stone in weight. She went down from 13 stone to her current weight of ten stone and switched from a size 14  to size 10. Her waist measurement shrunk from 34 inches to 30. She was so proud of her new figure that she posed in her favourite bikinis a few weeks later. She says she now feels like a 'completely new woman'. I don’t have to worry about anyone asking if I am still pregnant!,' she said. Despite going to the gym three times a week, Amy struggled to shift her 'mummy tummy' after the birth of Hattie (pictured) She added: ‘There is no doubt that the pills made all the difference. I had tried everything to shift my “mummy tummy” and at one point was going to the gym three times a week.' ‘But it was so difficult to diet and bring up the kids properly at the same time and I need a bit of extra help. ‘The pills only work really effectively if you combine them with exercise and a good diet – but they give me the impetus to get all elements of my life into order. ‘I don’t drink tea or coffee so I would really notice the energy boost when I took them. It was nothing strong – just a little pep up. 'But it was especially what I needed – particularly in the afternoons which were the time of day when I would have starting snacking.’ Amy’s confidence surged as she got back to her ideal weight. She explained: ‘I was losing around 4lbs a week. The weight just steadily came off and after four months I had shed three stone and all my excessive baby weight. My dreaded “mummy tummy” had gone. It is believed that Raspberry Ketone pills boost levels of a hormone called adiponectin, which regulates metabolism . ‘It was so great to have my flat . stomach back. I was confident enough to wear my tiny spaghetti strap . bikini on holiday in Egypt this Christmas.’ Amy, a self-employed business manager, is still not being complacent. She . said: ‘Now that I am close to my target weight I am still taking one . Raspberry Ketone a day. It helps to keep everything on an even keel.’ Her husband Tom, a regional manager with a firm of estate agents, is thrilled that his wife has all her old zip back. Amy said: 'I’m back wearing all my old tight tops on my nights out with the girls.'","Amy Middleton, from Brighton, struggled to shift her 'mummy tummy'

"After the 2001 terrorist attacks, California lawmakers sought a way to channel the patriotic fervour and use it to help victims' families and law enforcement. Their answer: specialty memorial license plates emblazoned with the words, 'We Will Never Forget.' Part of the money raised through the sale of the plates was to fund scholarships for the children of California residents who perished in the attacks, while the majority - 85 per cent - was to help fund anti-terrorism efforts. But an Associated Press review of the $15 million collected since lawmakers approved the 'California Memorial Scholarship Program' shows only a small fraction of the money went to scholarships. Never forget: Candice Hoglan has a license plate commemorating 9/11; her nephew Mark Bingham was one of the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 . Patriotic: California lawmakers issued specialty memorial license plates, but an AP investigation revealed much of the $15million made since 2001 hasn't gone where it should . While 40 per cent has funded anti-terror training programs, $3 million was raided by Gov. Jerry Brown and his predecessor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to plug the state's budget deficit. Millions more have been spent on budget items with little relation to direct threats of terrorism, including livestock diseases and workplace safety. Moreover, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has been advertising the plates as helping the children of Sept. 11 victims even though the state stopped funding the scholarship program seven years ago. The specialty plate fund continues to take in $1.5 million a year. Californians who lost loved ones in the attacks take the raid on the license plate fund as an affront to the memory of those who died. 'I can't believe that they would do that,' said Candice Hoglan, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and bought a plate to commemorate her nephew, Mark Bingham. 'We're paying extra for the plate; we're making a point, and it means a lot to us.' Mr Bingham was killed on United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania, and was one of the passengers who led the attempt to wrest control from the hijackers. His mother, Alice Hoagland, also was troubled by the program's apparent drift from its original purpose. 'I'm sorry that as we retreat in time from 9/11, we seem to be retreating in our resolve never to forget,' she said in a telephone interview. The plates, which cost an initial $50 plus a $40 annual renewal fee, feature an American flag partially obscured by clouds and the 'never forget' slogan. Residents of California, where all four jetliners were bound when they were hijacked, have bought or renewed the plates more than 200,000 times since 2002. In memoriam: Mark Bingham (left) was a passenger on United Airlines Flight 93; the aircraft crashed outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001 . Investigators flocked to the Pennsylvania field where Flight 93 went down; California residents are upset that the money meant for relief for victim's families were not used for that purpose . Of the other states directly associated with the 2001 attacks, only Virginia has established a similar specialty plate program. Yet it did not set up a special fund for the proceeds of its 'Fight Terrorism' plate. For the past decade, the California DMV has said on its website that the money will 'fund scholarships for the children of Californians who died in the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and helps California's law enforcement fight threats of terrorism.' It advertises the program with the slogan, 'Be a patriot.' While the DMV description of the program was not 'totally disingenuous,' the department should probably remove references to the scholarship program, said Joe DeAnda, a spokesman for the state treasurer's office, which disburses the money. 'It's out of date and it's on DMV to update that,' he said. Late Friday, the department modified the description of the license plate on its website to remove the reference to the scholarship program in response to the investigation by the AP, which began in March. Spokeswoman Jan Mendoza said the reason promotional materials were not updated sooner was 'unknown.' The DMV still lists the scholarship program on the online and hard copy form drivers fill out to buy the license plates, but Mendoza said the department will change this next time the forms are printed. The legislation establishing the plates had earmarked 15 per cent of the revenue for scholarships. Yet only $21,381 has reached the children and spouses of the three dozen California residents killed during the terrorist attacks. The state treasurer's office closed the scholarship program in 2005, the sign-up deadline for potential recipients, and has $60,000 in reserve. The borrowers: California Gov. Jerry Brown, left, and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, right, borrowed a respective $3million from the fund to close budget gaps . The total amount dedicated to scholarships was 1.5 per cent of the $5.5 million raised through the sale of the plates through 2005. The original legislation said the remainder of the money would go to 'law enforcement, fire protection, and public health agencies' to be used 'exclusively for purposes directly related to fighting terrorism.' But in 2008, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, borrowed $2 million to close a budget gap. Last year, Brown, a Democrat, borrowed another $1 million. Neither loan has been repaid nor are their deadlines to ensure they will be. Elizabeth Ashford, a spokeswoman for Brown, said the loans have done no harm. 'We're trying to simultaneously balance the budget and fund important programs,' she said. 'If there was an indication that borrowing this money was going to negatively impact this program, we wouldn't borrow the money.' The rest of the money has gone to a wide array of budgets and programs. The Legislature sent $3.7million to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, according to the Department of Finance, to establish an online food monitoring database and implement a variety of worker safety programs, including hiring industrial hygienists to tend to worker health. But it is difficult to say precisely where the money has gone. Late Friday, the agriculture department delivered documents it said were in response to a California Public Records Act request the AP filed eight weeks earlier. The response contained itemized budget reports going back six years and listing payments for all types of government functions, ranging from salaries and benefits, to printing costs and communication equipment. Among the details: $18,163 for furniture in 2006 and $11,492 for auto inspection in 2009. Capital job: Of the $15million collected, $3million was borrowed to close the state budget, another $3.7million was sent to the California Department of Agriculture, and $18,163 for furniture in 2009 alone . The response also included a legislative report on the threats the agriculture department is targeting with an online database the license plate program helps fund. A similar report from 2006, when the license plate money was first authorized, lists bio-terrorism as a potential danger. But the 2011 report focuses on food safety and livestock concerns, including foot-and-mouth disease and meat and poultry monitoring. Director of Animal Health and Food Safety Services Annette Whiteford said the department does not track license plate money separately from other funds. She said it would be wasteful to reserve the money exclusively for anti-terrorism work. For example, the department uses some of the money to buy safety suits that would be essential during an anthrax attack but also are useful for routine food investigations. 'The things that I worry about in the animal food safety division are very high consequence events, but very infrequent. So I always try to leverage those resources,' she said. Another $2million has gone to programs that aim to protect Californians from all manner of potential threats, not just those related to terrorism. The California Emergency Management Agency used nearly $1 million in memorial license plate money for general operations, including administrative costs, buying and fueling cars, and hiring a person from 2007 to 2009 to coordinate five so-called 'fusion centers,' according to documents obtained through a Public Records Act request. 'That's California. It's kind of a given these days - nothing is spent on what it's supposed to be.' -Former California resident Patricia Anderson . The other $1 million went directly to the fusion centers, which were founded after the 2001 attacks to focus on terrorist threats but have since switched to an 'all crimes' approach that includes gang activity and natural disasters. Herb Wesson, who wrote the license plate bill when he was speaker of the California Assembly, said he was saddened to hear how the money had been spent. 'I understand the financial climate they find themselves in, but they are not following the spirit and intent of the legislation,' said Wesson, now president of the Los Angeles City Council. 'The lion's share of the money was supposed to be given to local law enforcement so that they could beef up their anti-terrorism operations.' About 40 per cent of the total raised to date, or $6million, has gone to anti-terrorism training programs for fire-fighters and law enforcement officers. There is a slight discrepancy between the DMV's revenue figures and the Department of Finance's expenditure figures that neither agency could explain. Patricia Anderson, who paid $98 for a personalized memorial plate reading 'WE R 4US,' said she signed up for the program primarily to show respect for victims of the 9/11 attacks. Ms Anderson said she was disheartened but not surprised to learn that much of the money has gone to fill the state deficit or used for general purposes. 'That's California,' said Ms Anderson, who now lives near Austin, Texas. 'It's kind of a given these days - nothing is spent on what it's supposed to be.'","$15million collected since plates began being offered after 9/11 terrorist attacks - meant to help victim's families and law enforcement .

"A year ago they begged for Britain’s help when Colonel Gaddafi’s tanks encircled their city, threatening annihilation. Now former Libyan rebels in Benghazi – liberated with the aid of the RAF last March – have systematically desecrated the graves of more than 150 British servicemen killed in North Africa 70 years ago. Headstones at the Benghazi War Cemetery have been torn down and crucifixes smashed with hammers by a mob of extremists, some carrying guns and dressed in combat fatigues. Desecrated: The headstones commemorating the deaths of Allied servicemen, who fought in the Western Desert campaigns between 1942 to 1943, lay smashed on the ground . More than 1,000 soldiers and airmen who lost their lives in the desert wars of Montgomery and Rommel are buried at the site in Eastern Libya. Many were members of the famed 7th Armoured Division, known as the Desert Rats, who played  a crucial role in the see-saw battle for control of Libya and Egypt between 1941 and 1943. Graves of RAF pilots were among those shattered by the thugs. It was their job to fly bombing raids – just as the RAF did last year – to assist Lieutenant General Montgomery’s Eighth Army and support commandos clearing routes for tanks. Sickeningly, the attack, which was carried out over two days last week and appeared highly organised, was filmed by one of the men involved and posted on the internet. As they rampage among the graves, members of the mob are heard to repeatedly say of the dead servicemen: ‘They are dogs, they are dogs.’ Senseless: A man kicks down headstones of soldiers during the rampage that was filmed and posted online . The violence was thought to be retaliation, in part, for the burning of the Koran by US soldiers in Afghanistan last month. Footage shows the mob methodically kicking down grave after grave. Some are then smashed with hammers. ‘Destroy that cross, they are dogs,’ cries one hooded rebel. Another voice is heard saying: ‘We begin with this one then we’ll take care of that other one. We won’t leave any left.’ A few seconds later another extremist says: ‘This tomb has a cross on it – a disbeliever.’ As they discover a Jewish grave bearing the Star of David, one of the men says: ‘Look at what it says on  it. There is even Israeli writing . . .  in Hebrew.’ And in one of the most disturbing sequences, one protester attaches a ladder to the Cross of Remembrance next to the cemetery. He climbs up it and begins hacking at the memorial with a hammer. Then he shouts: ‘Watch out young people. It’s going to fall.’ The cross is then smashed off. Sacrifice: Some 1,214 graves are marked in Benghazi War Cemetery . Relatives of those buried at the . cemetery, which is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, . last night reacted with disgust. The desecration was also condemned by . Montgomery’s grandson Henry Montgomery, who called it ‘very sad’. The Libyan government has been 'extremely apologetic' about the desecration of British war graves in the eastern city of Benghazi, a Foreign Office Minister said today. Jeremy Browne said people would be understandably upset by images of damaged graves in today's papers, including the Mail on Sunday. But he said the attacks were not aimed particularly at Britain or Christians, and did not represent a Libyan response to last year's military action when British aircraft took part in a campaign which toppled Colonel Gadaffi from his role as dictator in the North African country. Mr Browne told the programme: 'There is an appalling story and people will be shocked by the photos. My grandfather's generation were truly heroic in that part of Africa in the Second World War and I think people will be shocked by what they see. 'It is worth saying the Libyan authorities themselves are shocked too. We have had direct dealings with them. They have been extremely apologetic and made a very strong commitment they will get to the bottom of this happening. They will try and do everything they can to resolve it. 'My understanding it is not just British graves or just Christian graves that have been desecrated, there is wider desecration taking place. The Libyan authorities are keen to work with us on this. 'I would not want people to think this is somehow an ingratitude by the government of Libya. That's not the case.' Among . the heroes buried at Benghazi is Geoffrey Keyes, who was the youngest . lieutenant colonel in the British Army when he was killed at the age of . 24 during Operation Flipper, a daring mission 250 miles behind enemy . lines. He was shot in a . raid on what was believed to be Rommel’s headquarters in Sidi Rafa, . Libya, in November 1941 and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross . for ‘magnificent leadership and outstanding gallantry . . . and supreme . self-sacrifice’. It was not . clear last night if his headstone was among those destroyed. But one of . the smashed headstones records the death of the Reverend Geoffrey Bond, . Chaplain to the Forces, who was 30 when he was killed on March 21, . 1941, near Benghazi. His nephew, Geoffrey Bell, said last night: ‘This . is terrible news. Damn those bloody Libyans.’ Former diplomat Edward Chaplin, who heads the War Graves Commission, said: ‘Clearly it’s a terrible thing to have happened. ‘It’s . shocking that attacks of this nature should be carried out against a . cemetery. We take very seriously the preservation of these memorials to . those who have given their lives in wars.’ Mustafa Abdul Jalil, head of state in . Libya’s caretaker government, condemned the attacks as ‘unethical, . irresponsible and criminal’. He said the Libyan government ‘severely . denounces such shameful acts and vows to find and prosecute the . perpetrators’. There are 1,214 Commonwealth . servicemen of the Second World War buried or commemorated at  the . Benghazi War Cemetery. Of the 1,051 identified graves, 851 are  British. It also contains graves of Australian, New Zealand, South African and . Indian servicemen. Religious hate: Fanatics attack a Jewish headstone . One . shattered headstone, broken into a dozen pieces, records the death of a . Canadian pilot, M. P. Northmore, who was killed in October 1943. The . cemetery is the last resting place for several soldiers from one of . Britain’s oldest regiments, the King’s Royal Rifle Corps, founded in . 1775. Four of the regiment’s battalions took part in the North Africa . campaign and one of its members, Rifleman John Beeley, was awarded the . Victoria Cross after being killed while storming a German machine-gun . post at the battle of Sidi Rezegh in November 1941. Richard . Frost, secretary of the regiment association, said: ‘Our 1,500 . surviving members will find it difficult to cope with what has happened. All riflemen, regardless of their age or where they served, will be . disgusted by these scenes.’ Wrecked: Extremists fetch a ladder to smash away at the war memorial next to the cemetery . Fury: Extremists hack away at the monunent . Disrespect: A man smashes the cross with a hammer . Sad: A remnant of the cross lies smashed on the floor . Shattered: The memorial after it was attacked by the mob . Pamela Thornton-Bassett, whose father, Flight Lieutenant Frank Thornton-Bassett, is buried at  Benghazi, said she was ‘greatly saddened’ by the attack. The RAF officer was 40 when he died in an aircraft crash near the city on February 3, 1943. His daughter, who lives in Halesowen in the West Midlands, said:  ‘He was attached to a unit that set up broadcasting facilities and was sent out to Cairo when Churchill was there to make an important speech. On the way back to Benghazi, where he was based, my father’s plane was brought down in the desert by a mechanical fault. The pilot was killed outright and one of the crew walked away. My father was badly injured and survived for a week. ‘I was concerned about what would happen to the cemetery all the time Gaddafi was in power. I never visited because I was put off by the thought of him running the country. Yet now this happens after his departure.’ A Commonwealth War Graves Commission spokesman promised that the cemetery would be restored ‘to a standard befitting the sacrifice of those commemorated at Benghazi’. But he added: ‘This could take some time because we will need to source replacement stones.’ Although the burning of the Koran was blamed for the desecration, others in the city believe it was also a perverse expression of deeper frustrations. The uprising that brought an end to Gaddafi’s 42-year rule began in Benghazi, but many of the rebels there now feel left behind in the new Libya. Since the transitional government moved west to the capital Tripoli, they say they have been ignored and have suffered economic hardship. 'He had a special aura': The top half of Rev Bond's smashed memorial . Rev Bond at his wedding to Patricia in 1940 . It lies smashed in half and smeared with red earth from the boots of the men who stamped upon it. Like the rest of the 1,200 plain white gravestones in Benghazi War Cemetery, it records only elementary details. It says that the Reverend Geoffrey Bond, Chaplain to the Forces, died  on March 21, 1941, at the age of 30. And below this stark fact is a cross and the inscription: ‘Let light shine perpetually on him.’ But yesterday, traced by The Mail on Sunday, one of his surviving relatives recalled a cultivated, ‘extraordinarily charismatic’ man. David Bell said: ‘He was my mother’s brother and a very wonderful man. ‘I was only a baby when he died but my mother absolutely adored him.  She spoke of his special aura, a way he had of making everyone feel better about themselves. ‘I had a brother who died aged three and I know Geoffrey counselled my mother afterwards and played a crucial role in getting her through her grief.’ Mr Bell said his Cambridge-educated uncle – whose own father Bernard was killed at the Somme in 1916 – was also held in affection by servicemen who greatly valued his pastoral care. When he married Patricia Hodges  in Surrey in March 1940, he was presented with a silver cigarette box  by officers from 1st Heavy Armoured Brigade. His widow died in 1990. Of the attack on the cemetery, Mr Bell said: ‘It is greatly upsetting, a disaster.’","Headstones torn down and crucifixes smashed with hammers by extremists .

"Roxanne Pallett has managed to shed over a stone to transform herself . into suspender-wearing leading lady Janet Weiss for The Rocky Horror . Show . While Roxanne may have gained notoriety as one of the sexiest women on TV when she played Jo Sugden in ITV soap opera Emmerdale, even she was daunted by the thought of being scantily clad for the majority of the show. She overhauled her diet, switching to healthy alternatives of her favourite foods and rehearsing up to eight hours a day to lose an impressive 15 pounds. Ultimately, 5ft 1in Roxanne dropped from 8st in October to 7st in January this year. Roxanne looks amazing in this weeks issue of OK! where she opens up about loosing a stone . Roxanne has lost 15 pounds since October, from 8st (left) to 7st (right) to shape up for her role . Speaking about her decision to trim down her her figure for the famous role, Roxanne said: 'If you put on a few pounds and you’re not doing a job in the public eye, it’s okay because when you’re in the office you can hide under clothes or if you’re at home you can hide behind your onesie. 'So during the rehearsal period for Rocky Horror, I realised I needed to feel confident with my body to play that role with conviction because the audience can see if you’re not comfortable. ‘When you’re on television, or film, or on stage, you can’t hide – you have to be in the costume of that character and most of the time it’s sexy or revealing. You have to be confident,’ ‘Janet is a wholesome American girl in the beginning, wearing a little pink dress, but that’s only the first 10 minutes – for the next hour and a half I’m in my underwear!’ 'By January I had gone down to 7st so they had to take my costume in. It’s always been the other way round with me. In Emmerdale they usually had to take the costume out as I was much bigger than the other girls. ‘And I feel better… I’ve been saying to everybody it’s not how I look, it’s how I feel that makes a difference.' In an exclusive interview with OK! Magazine out today, the 30-year-old also said that raspberry ketones supplements helped her shift the extra weight. There can be no doubt that Roxanne embodies her role as the sexy Janet Weiss in the shoot for OK! as she shows of her newly trim figure lounging on a couch . Raspberry ketone is a fruit extract . that claims to 'burn body fat' and has been dubbed a 'miracle' weight . loss supplement by some. Though raspberry ketone has been on . the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safe list since 1965, it has only . been marketed as a weight loss supplement since 2004 after a study in . Japan found it prevented weight increases in mice on a high fat diet. No similar studies have been conducted . on humans, and critics believe one would need to consume huge . quantities of the product to see the same kind of results as the study . with mice. But Roxanne is convinced the tablets have helped her with her weight loss. ‘I’m doing eight shows a week so . that’s a lot of cardio, a lot of movement, a lot of dancing. That’s like . going to the gym eight times a week. That with the Forza Raspberry . Ketone tablets which I’ve been taking once a day, they’ve both . contributed to my weight loss. 'And it’s really safe because it’s a . food supplement, it’s not a slimming pill. It’s something you take once a . day to increase your fat breakdown, and because it’s raspberries, it’s . natural. 'If you can find something that has . that natural ability to speed up your metabolism that is safe, that . works well, that’s great. Especially with a woman’s metabolism because I . think it slows down when you get to a certain age.' ‘I’m a big fan of the Kardashians and I . love Oprah, and I’d heard from them both that they’d contributed to . their weight loss with these ketone supplements that speed up your . metabolism. Roxanne says when she was in Emmerdale her costumes had to be taken out as she was bigger than the other actresses on the show, but says her weight loss has given her new confidence . ‘I’ve always looked to the Kardashians . as healthy role models because they’re glamorous women and they’re not . trying to be skinny, they’re celebrating their hourglass figures. That’s . what drew my attention, because I’ve got an hourglass figure - I’ve got . a 32DD bust.’ Roxanne admits that she has found maintaining her figure harder as she gets older, but says that she now makes health conscious choices when it comes to her food. 'I just take the healthier options now. Rather than eating those sugary cereals that we all love, I’ll eat wholemeal toast with peanut butter, a banana, or porridge. I’ve replaced all the Starbucks hot chocolates and drinks for teas, so I’ll have a chamomile tea or a peppermint tea. 'And that’s better for my vocals too, because I have to sing six songs for The Rocky Horror Show' she says. The petite brunette has learned which foods are detrimental to her quest to drop the pounds, saying: ‘I stay away from white bread, I don’t have paninis or ciabatta. Anything like that is the enemy to my waistline - because I’m 5 ft 1in, it really shows when I put on weight. I just don’t have the height to balance it out.' Her revamped diet involves less processed and junk food. Instead she eats nutritious food in smaller portions but more often. Roxanne's full interview is in this weeks OK! magazine, out now . Describing a typical day the actress says: ‘For lunch or dinner I’ll have a jacket potato with beans or a stir-fry, but I make sure I don’t have microwave meals because they don’t fill you up. I also eat little and often, so I have five small meals a day, things that are going to give me energy for the show but are still good carbohydrates. 'All my friends are actually coming to me saying, ‘How have you lost a stone, every time I see you you’re eating!’, but it’s about what you eat and when you eat. Don’t eat late at night – you know, I used to be the girl who put a pizza in the oven late at night, but not now.' But despite this virtuous diet and active lifestyle rehearsing her dance routines for the show, Roxanne confesses she isn’t depriving herself too much. ‘I’m such a big fan of chocolate and chips, I usually can’t go a day without chocolate. But the thing is portion control – rather than eating an entire chocolate bar, I’ll eat half and I’ll put the other half in the fridge for the next day. ‘If you halve portions, you’re still having a bit of what you love but you’re not over-indulging. And twice a week, I’ll still have my Nutella on toast. I can’t deprive myself, so that’s my little indulgence! With this balanced attitude to her new diet and slim line figure, Roxanne is confident that these changes will be long lasting. She says: ‘I’m definitely going to maintain it. I think when most people hit their target weight they relax into it and then it creeps back up. 'When I did Dancing on Ice I think I lost a dress size, but it was muscle, it wasn’t dieting, it was all from skating every day. When it came to an end my weight crept up again. 'I will definitely be keeping up with the Forza Raspberry Ketone supplements and I’ll keep working out, because you have to eat properly and you must have some form of active cardio in your day to day life, because you can’t sit at home and eat a Chinese takeaway and take a raspberry ketone supplement - it doesn’t work like that!'

"It is the scientific research that will provide husbands with the perfect excuse to join their mates in the pub. A leading psychologist claims men’s health and well-being are greatly improved if they see their friends twice a week. Professor Robin Dunbar of Oxford University claims in a report that while ‘talking with mates’ on a daily basis is valuable, to experience the real benefits of friendship men must meet up in person twice a week with four friends and ‘do stuff’. Meeting up: A leading psychologist claims men's health and well-being are greatly improved if they see their friends twice a week and 'do stuff' like a trip to the pub (library image) Recommended activities range from playing football or rugby to simply sharing a joke in the pub over a pint of beer. The report says that men who maintain social groups are healthier, recover from illness more quickly and tend to be more generous. Despite the findings, two out of five men claim they manage to meet their friends only once a week and a further third struggle to catch up that frequently. Men spend one fifth of their day socially interacting with people from their network of around 150 ‘acquaintances’, mainly through online social media, text and phone conversations. However, the research proves men need to actually get together in person to prevent the quality  of their friendships eroding and, more importantly, experience the benefits associated with strong male bonds. Men, on average, spend just less than half of their social time with an inner circle of four to five close mates – and research suggests  that this is linked directly to the banter that such a group inspires and its benefits. Through empirical studies, it has been proven that laughter is much less likely to occur if a social circle becomes bigger than five – and, because of laughter’s ability to produce the endorphin surges that give a sense of well-being, men may be subconsciously drawn towards ‘hanging out’ in social circles of this size. Online: Men spend one fifth of their day interacting with people from their network of around 150 'acquaintances', through online social media, text and phone conversations, the study showed (library image) Professor Dunbar, whose report was commissioned by Guinness, said: ‘Bonds can be formed through a range of activities from team sports to male banter – or simply having a pint with your pals on a Friday night. However, the key to maintaining strong friendships is to meet up twice a week and do stuff with the four people closest to you.’ Stephen O’Kelly, from Guinness, said: ‘When guys get together physically and more frequently with their mates, their friendships become stronger, better and a richer life results.’ The writer Danny Wallace said: ‘Science is telling us to have more fun together and do more stuff. This is great news, for we must obey science.’ The mental health charity Mind has warned that men can be hit by depression because of worries about money and job insecurity. Long working hours can also have a dramatic impact on men, but spending time with friends is considered a key part of combating depression.","Robin Dunbar of Oxford University .

"Joanne Jackson, 40, from Thornhill, West Yorks, had a series of pictures taken to celebrate beating the disease . Social networking site removed images, citing 'nudity and pornography' rule . Incident comes as Facebook bans U.S. mother's photos of baby who died from birth defect for 'graphic content' Photographs showing the amazing strength and courage of a woman who has beaten cancer have been removed by Facebook for being 'pornography'. Mother-of-two Joanne Jackson, 40, had a photo session to commemorate winning her battle with the killer disease after having a mastectomy - and posted them on the social networking site. But Facebook removed some of the images, which revealed her operation scar, for being offensive. Joanne has been warned that further 'abusive' breaches will result in her account being shut down. BANNED: This is the photograph of Joanne Jackson, 40, who was diagnosed with breast cancer last June and had a mastectomy, that was removed Facebook after being deemed 'pornographic' Angry Joanne, a Slimming World consultant of Thornhill, Dewsbury, West Yorks., said: 'There is nothing pornographic or explicit about these pictures. That was not the idea at all. 'I took breast cancer and the mastectomy in my stride and decided it wasn't going to stop me living my life. It wasn't going to define who I was, and it didn't make me any less attractive as a woman. 'My attitude was to just get on with it. I knew I could kick cancer's ass and I did.' Former council youth worker Joanne was approached by a friend, whose husband Paul Hodgson was a professional photographer, and she jumped at the chance to pose for pictures. She said: 'I am not one who is shy but these pictures weren't as much about me as about other women who had maybe just been diagnosed with breast cancer. 'It doesn't have to be a death sentence and there is life after a mastectomy. 'The images aren't fluffy, they are real and I am very proud of them.' Joanne's story is one of great inspiration as she only discovered she had breast cancer after dieting and losing five stones in weight, dropping from a size 22 to a size 10. Inspirational: Wishing to help others through her story, Joanne had the series of photos taken to celebrate her survival. She posted them on her own Facebook page and on the pages of several cancer organisations . Offensive? Facebook removed the photos, citing the rule that banned 'pornography and graphic sexual content' from the social networking site. Any further breaches would result in the closure of her account, they said . She joined Slimming World in April 2009 weighing 15st 4lbs, after putting on weight as a result of suffering years of heartache, including four miscarriages. She now weighs 10st 5lbs. Thanks to her weight loss, Joanne's bust reduced from a size 40HH to 30C. In May last year she discovered she had a lump in her breast. Fighting fit: Joanne lost five stone in 2009, and the resulting reduction in her bust size was the reason she was able to spot the tumours in her breast . Tests revealed she had two types of cancer in her left breast. Her breast care nurse Debbie Weevel said: 'If Joanne hadn't lost the weight that she did, the lump wouldn't have been spotted until much later and it could have been too late.' Joanne, who is married to self-employed cobbler Andrew and has two sons Connah, 19, and Evan, five, posted the images that celebrated her survival in her own Facebook album and on pages for various cancer organisations. She has no idea who reported them but the warning came out of the blue. The message said: 'Content you shared on Facebook has been removed because it violated Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. 'Shares that contain nudity, pornography and graphic sexual content are not permitted on Facebook. 'This serves as a warning. Additional violations may result in the termination of your account.' The message added that Joanne should 'refrain from posting abusive material in the future.' Joanne's Facebook friends have also taken up the fight and the images have been re-posted as far afield as Australia, the USA, Canada and Spain. 'It's censorship, pure and simple,' said Joanne, who is now having breast reconstruction. 'And I'm not backing down so Facebook can do their worst.' Photographer Mr Hodgson, of Huddersfield-based Box of Frogs, said the pictures were 'inspirational, not salacious or erotic' and added: 'This is about showing that a cancer diagnosis does not mean your life has ended. 'These pictures show that you can beat cancer and still be you.' A Facebook spokesman confirmed that 'several' images had been removed because they breached terms and conditions. 'He said Facebook welcomed mastectomy pictures but said that some images may breach regulations. Last week Facebook came under fire for deleting a mother's photos of her baby who died hours after being born with a rare birth defect. Heather Walker's baby Grayson had anencephaly, a condition that meant his skull did not form fully over his brain. Heather, from Memphis, Tennessee, posted several photos of Grayson on Facebook after his death, one which showed the baby without a hat. It was this photo that was deemed 'graphic content' by Facebook and deleted. Heather said: 'They allow people to post almost nude pictures of themselves, profanity, and so many other things but I'm not allowed to share a picture of God's beautiful creation.' Memories: Heather Walker and her husband Patrick had a professional photographer take photos of Grayson, who died after only eight hours. But Facebook deleted some of the photos that showed the baby, born with a rare condition that meant his skull did not form properly over his brain, without his hat . After repeatedly putting the removed picture on her profile, Heather's account was temporarily disabled. An appeal to Facebook led to the mother's account being reactivated and the picture of her baby which was deemed 'graphic' allowed to remain. A spokesman for Facebook denied that Heather was ever banned from the site, and said in a statement: 'On rare occasions, a photo reported to us may be too graphic too be permitted on the site. In these cases, the person who posted the photo is contacted, and the photos are removed. 'We strive to fit the needs of a diverse community while respecting everyone's interest in sharing content that is important to them. 'It is important to note that any photos that are removed – whether inappropriately or in accordance with our policies – are only done so after being brought to our attention by other Facebook users who report them as violations, and when such reports are subsequently reviewed by Facebook.' Ban: Joanne took to Twitter to talk about the Facebook ban on her mastectomy photo . According to Facebook's community standards page, there are nine types of content that may be deemed offensive and removed: Violence and Threats, Self-Harm, Bullying and Harassment, Hate Speech, Graphic Violence, Nudity and Pornography, Identity and Privacy, Intellectual Property and Phishing and Spam. Joanne's photos were banned under the Nudity and Pornography clause. IN THEIR RULES AND REGULATIONS FACEBOOK SAYS: . 'We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:'You will not post content that: is hateful, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.' 'You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.' In their statement regarding Joanne's photographs, a spokesman confirmed 'several'  the images were deemed to be in breach of this rule. He said Facebook welcomed mastectomy pictures but said that some images may breach regulations.","Joanne Jackson, 40, from Thornhill, West Yorks, had a series of pictures taken to celebrate beating the disease .

"A man has been arrested after a shoot-out with police following a siege in which he took his pregnant girlfriend hostage, as well as their four-month-old son. Four NYPD officers were wounded by Nakwon Foxworth after they intervened in an argument he was having over access to the corridors of his apartment building early on Sunday morning. Two officers were hit in the leg and the others were grazed by the suspect's bullets after he barricaded himself in the building. They were taken to hospital  after the attack in  Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn and all were expected to recover from their injuries. Shooter: Nakwon Foxworth, 33, is accused of taking his pregnant girlfriend Jessica Hickling, right, and their 4-month-old son hostage during a shootout with police early on Sunday morning . According to witnesses at the scene, Foxworth, 33, was arriving back to his apartment about 10.30pm . on Saturday night with his pregnant girlfriend, identified as Jessica . Hickling, and their four-month-old son when the . trouble started. Angry with movers whose barrel was . blocking the service entrance, Foxworth allegedly started to argue with . the movers before turning physical with them, according to the movers. 'He took the stroller, with the baby in it, and started ramming it into the . barrel,' mover Kairon Decaul, 43, told the Daily News. 'He became very angry. The woman started screaming, ""The baby! The . baby!"",' Mr Decaul recalled. Foxworth then pulled out a gun, according to the man, chasing one of the two out to his truck. 'He . came back inside and threw the gun in the baby's stroller. He put his finger in . my face and threatened me. The girl was screaming, ""Calm down! calm . down!"" Mr Decaul said. Injured: Captain Al Pizzano (left) and Detective Kenneth Ayala were shot during a stand-off with a suspect in Brooklyn . Survivors: Detective Michael Keenan (left) and . Officer Matthew Granahan attended the scene where a man was holding his . pregnant girlfriend and baby hostage . Fleeing . to their sixth floor apartment, Foxworth barricaded himself, his . girlfriend and their child inside while the outside mover called police. Ms Hickling surprised NYPD officers outside the apartment's door . when she dashed out two hours later carrying her son in her arms. 'When she just left and left the door open, he started shooting,' Commissioner Ray Kelly said. According to Mr Kelly, the close quarters had 'the . assailant and the officers no more than 10 feet apart.' On watch: The four NYPD officers were expected to make a full recovery after being shot in the early hours of Sunday morning . The injured officers were named as . Captain Al Pizzano, Detective Kenneth Ayala, Detective Mike Keenan and . Police Officer Matthew Granahan. After shooting 12 times, Foxworth was struck in the stomach. He was taken to King's County Hospital . and was in a stable but critical condition. A search of the apartment found that Foxworth, who has served time for attempted murder, robbery and selling drugs, had several illegal guns and ammunition at the apartment. New York Mayor Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly visited the injured men in hospital this morning. Illegal possession: Several guns were found in the sixth floor apartment in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn . Chilling: The deadly weapons are pictured lying next to children's toys in the couple's apartment . Mr Bloomberg said: 'We just visited . members of the Department who were injured in a shooting this morning . that we wanted to brief you on: Captain Al Pizzano, Detective Kenneth . Ayala, Detective Mike Keenan and Police Officer Matthew Granahan. 'Fortunately, all are in stable condition and are expected to fully . recover. 'We have now had eight - that's . correct, eight - members of the department shot in the last four months. And this is the second time in the last 24 hours police have been fired . upon by armed assailants. Shoot out: Four police officers were injured during the exchange of fire in Brooklyn, New York . 'All . the shootings have a disgraceful fact in common: all were committed . with illegal guns that came from out of state. And that is the case with . nearly every shooting in our city. 'We . got very lucky tonight, with no life-threatening injuries to officers . or innocent bystanders. But sometimes, as you remember, we aren't so . lucky, as we saw with the murder of Police Officer Peter Figoski in . December.' Detective Keenan, 52, is a 28-year veteran of the NYPD and Detective Ayala, 49, has served for 18 years. Mr Granahan, 35, has worked for the NYPD for 11 years and Mr Pizzano, 45, is a 25-year veteran.","Shooter Nakwon Foxworth struck in the stomach as officers returned fire .

"Had initially declined offer from Brazilian President for medical assistance . Spoke after a pre-Easter mass to beg God to spare his life . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called on God to spare his life, in an emotional speech to the Catholic community. Chavez cried and his voice broke in the televised speech made in his home of Barinas, in front of his parents and other relatives. The 57-year-old praised Jesus, revolutionary fighter Ernesto 'Che' Guevara and South American independence hero Simon Bolivar. Chavez is believed to be flying to Brazil for treatment after his alleged  mishandling in Cuba . 'Never forget that we are the children of giants ... I could not avoid some tears,"" he said. 'Give me your crown, Jesus. Give me . your cross, your thorns so that I may bleed. But give me life, because I . have more to do for this country and these people. Do not take me yet.' Chavez made his plea standing below an image of Jesus with the Crucifix after a pre-Easter mass. He . was anchored by his mother and father who both held his hand as a . priest led a prayer for his health. The public display of emotion came as Chavez scheduled an emergency trip to Brazil after allegedly suffering  intestinal burns during his cancer radiation treatment in Cuba. Chavez, left, attended a Mass service where prayers were held in his honour . Doctors have been treating the former soldier since he was diagnosed in June last year. He . had hoped to extend his reign with an additional six-year term in the . country's national elections on October 7, but the latest setback could . now jeopardise his chances for reelection. However he dismissed those suggestions, insisting: 'So far, fortunately there hasn't been any adverse reaction to the treatment. 'All the exams that have been carried out have shown positive results of physical recovery,' he told The Associated Press. Brazilian media have countered his claim, revealing that the cancer-stricken president is heading for the Sirio e Libanes hospital in Sao Paulo. After . initially rejecting Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff offer for . medical assistance is July, in favour of treatment in Cuba, the reported . mishandling has led Chavez deliberating his future care. Reports suggest that Cuban medics administered the radiation improperly causing his burns.","Had initially declined offer from Brazilian President for medical assistance .

"Helen Croydon went undercover on a marital affair website to find out reasons men cheat . Helen Mirren recently said: 'Marriage doesn't need sex.' But one sexpert begs to differ, saying a marriage may not need sex - if you don't mind your husband playing away. Now Helen Croydon, author of controversial tell-all book The Sugar Daddy Diaries, has gone undercover to ascertain exactly why men stray from long-term relationships - and to lift the lid on how to prevent it. Helen undertook the project as research for her new book, Screw The Fairytale, in which she explores modern models of relationships  as alternatives to marriage. She worked along with adult lifestyle website Bondara to discover why men stray from long term relationships and reveal how to deal with it. Helen says: 'While researching my next book I spoke to hundreds of men and women about their relationship blips, successes, affairs or their choices not to commit at all. 'I’ve targeted men on the UK’s largest . cheating website, maritalaffair.co.uk and even been undercover on that . and so-called sugar daddy websites to get to grips with common male . motivations for straying.' Helen found that sexual dissatisfaction was the most common 'complaint' cited by men as a reason to stray, with men saying things like, ‘the physical side has faded,’ or ‘our sex has become routine’. In this case Helen advises you need to make time for sex - and the more you orgasm, the more you'll want to. She also says if you have relationship problems - another big reason men cheat - try counselling before splitting. But some of her findings are a lot less predictable. Sexual dissatisfaction was the most common 'complaint', with men saying 'the physical side has faded' Here, FEMAIL reveal Helen's top five surprising reasons why men cheat... 1. Feeling surplus to needsCommon amongst new fathers and the partner of someone with a demanding job. The less busy partner feels unneeded. Think bored housewife and a husband who doesn’t even notice when she gets a haircut. Or the hard-working husband whose weekend is filled with nothing but more chores. These types complained that their relationship had become functional. They craved the freshness of new romance and went elsewhere to find it. What to do: . Relationships should make us feel loved and energised otherwise we’re better off alone. So make your partner feel that way. Stop keeping tabs on who’s done what. In the long run it doesn’t matter. Take time every day to talk and listen to each other - even if it’s just for 15 minutes over dinner or while you have pre-bedtime cup of cocoa. 'Take time every day to talk and listen to each other - even if it's just for 15 minutes over dinner' 2. In love but lacking romance . I was surprised by how many men said they loved their wives deeply and were not looking to end their marriage, but wanted ‘something extra’. Not necessarily sex but the romance - dinners and dates. Many expressed they wanted to ‘feel like they looked forward to seeing someone again.’ What to do: . Sadly familiarity can cancel out passion even though familiarity is what we all want from a relationship. It’s easy to steer your relationship away from dreary domesticity though and become fascinated in each other again. Many expressed they wanted to 'feel like they looked forward to seeing someone again' 3. Partner health issuesWhen one partner has health problems which limit their sexual life, the other partner may consider this as an amnesty on fidelity. Any previous guilt is removed by the fact that their partner can no longer fulfil roles in the relationship that they once could. I met several men who claimed their wives had consented to them seeking sexual - but not emotional - fulfilment outside of marriage. What to do: . Consent is key here. Just because you think you’re not cheating, doesn’t mean your partner wouldn’t feel cheated. There’s nothing wrong with a negotiated open relationship but for those that can’t handle the thought of that, you’ll have to address the sex imbalance some other way. Just because you think you're not cheating, doesn't mean your partner wouldn't feel cheated . 4. The ‘one last time’ syndromeCommon amongst men and women who are about to get married or make a similar commitment. They feel they can hold onto their previous identity with one last experience of their old life. They mistakenly believe that one final memory will sustain them for years ahead of ‘being good.’ What to do: . This is just a fantasy. ‘One last time’ won’t make them feel any more experienced than they already felt when they committed. If you suspect your partner is daunted by the idea of long-term sexual fidelity, embrace their sexual appetite rather than try to repress it. Encourage them to talk about things they would like to try and to share their fantasies so they feel you will help them fulfil them rather than hanker them. Why not organise a naughty weekend away with sexy lingerie and some fun masks and ropes and pretend you’ve just met. Even if it’s just ten minutes from home. Opportunism is rarer than people may think . 5. OpportunismThankfully more rare than people may think. A man or a woman is out of town and a new, exciting and novel experience comes up and they think ‘no one will ever know.’ It does happen but not often. To act on a fantasy usually requires mental preparation and lots of suppression of guilt so it’s unlikely a quick chat on a bar stool in a strange hotel will make someone jump into bed. In my experience, people who stray on a whim have done it before or already given it some thought. What to do: . It’s easier to say what not to do. Don’t keep tabs on your partner. Don’t be controlling or demand they phone. Too much control only makes someone want to break free. Trust builds respect and there’s no better defence to cheating than respect.","Sugar Daddy Diaries author Helen Croydon goes undercover on extra-marital affair and sugar daddy websites .

"Tony Blair’s appearance at the Leveson Inquiry was dramatically interrupted yesterday when a protester burst in to the chamber and accused him of being a ‘war criminal’. The former prime minister was giving evidence when 49-year-old David Lawley-Wakelin emerged through a doorway behind Lord Justice Leveson. He shouted: ‘This man should be arrested for war crimes’, gesturing to  Mr Blair. Mr Lawley-Wakelin claimed that Mr Blair had been ‘bought’ by JP Morgan, and that the US investment bank had profited from the Iraq War. Scroll down for video . Bundled out: Tony Blair (far left) appeared unfazed by the disruption. Lord Justice Leveson (standing to the right of the commotion, did not. Robert Jay QC (standing below Leveson) held his head in his hands . After the protester was bundled out, a furious Lord Justice Leveson demanded an inquiry into how he had managed to reach ‘what is supposed to be a secure corridor’. Shortly afterwards a cheerful Mr Lawley-Wakelin was marched out of the court and into a van by police officers. He was arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace but released without charge after two hours. A second man was also held after an egg was thrown at Mr Blair's Range Rover as he left the High Court following his evidence. The dramatic earlier disruption echoed that of Jonnie Marbles who thrust a custard pie into Rupert Murdoch's face during his evidence to a Commons Select Committee last year, provoking wife Wendi Deng to athletically leap to the mogul's defence. Filmmaker and veteran Iraq-War protester Lawley-Wakelin, 49, who said he was from the Alternative Iraq Enquiry, shouted to a stunned courtroom: 'JP Morgan paid him off for the Iraq war. Three months after he invaded Iraq they held up the Iraq bank for 20 billion. 'He was then paid six million dollars every year and still is from JP Morgan six months after he left office. This man is a war criminal.' Embarrassing: David Lawley-Wakelin, dressed in a white shirt and chinos, then shouted to the stunned court, 'This man should be arrested for war crimes' 'Completely untrue': After peace was restored to the courtroom, Mr Blair told the court that the man's accusations were 'completely and utterly untrue' The drama began when Mr Lawley-Wakelin burst in, having managed to get past security to access the private corridor into courtroom 73. As chief counsel Robert Jay QC, who had been leading Blair's grilling, held his head in his hands, security guards jumped on the man to stifle the commotion and bundled him out of the chamber. Mr Blair, who is a senior adviser at JP Morgan on a reported salary of between £500,000 and £2.5million, immediately told the court that the man's accusations were 'completely and utterly untrue'. Protester: David Lawley-Wakelin was arrested but it wasn't his first Blair protest. He also interrupted a debate on the Iraq War on BBC's Question Time . Quizzed: David Lawley-Wakelin was taken to a central London police station for questioning . Arrested: David Lawley-Wakelin said he was from the Alternative Iraq Enquiry as he was escorted from the Royal Courts of Justice . Police and prosecutors are now deciding whether to press charges against Mr Lawley-Wakelin . The father of two, a fierce opponent of the war on Iraq, has publicly heckled Mr Blair before, during an episode of the BBC’s Question Time. A freelance documentary filmmaker, he is separated from his wife Angela and lives alone in Notting Hill. After his release yesterday, he said the security at the inquiry was so lax that he was able to walk straight in through the back. ‘I tried to get in through the front entrance but they stopped me. I figured Leveson himself would enter a different way so I walked around, found an empty court and went through the back door of it. It was not the first televised anti-Blair protest by David Lawley-Wakelin. The filmmaker and veteran Iraq-War protester launched a similar attack during an episode of Question Time on the BBC (pictured above). Posing as a member of the public until he was passed the microphone, he yelled: 'This country is led by liars who are prepared to kill in the name of oil.' His outburst was met with rapturous applause. He later travelled to Iraq to make a short film in which he claimed 'to ask its citizens and military personnel whether they agreed with him'. The Alternative Iraq Enquiry then asks: 'Should Tony Blair be taken to the Hague and tried for crimes against peace?' Following a screening of the film at the Frontline Club in west London in 2010, he led a debate with former Labour MP Clare Short and Major General Tim Cross, who was commander of the British Army during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. According to the Internet Movie Database, the film and TV professional was an assistant director on 27 episodes of Time Team - hosted by Tony Robinson - and a first assistant director on a 2010 Everest documentary entitled The Wildest Dream. He is currently an assistant director on a new horror movie called Saint Dracula 3D. On his Facebook page, under the section entitled 'political views', he writes: 'Blair and at least four of his cronies should be behind bars...' He once also appeared with anti-Iraq war MP George Galloway in a TalkSport radio show last year. ‘I walked around and managed to find Leveson’s personal chamber.There was no one there so I just went straight in.’ Mr Lawley-Wakelin said it was yesterday morning that he had decided to make his gesture on the ‘spur of the moment’. He added: ‘For evil to carry on it just takes for good men to do nothing. Whenever Blair is in public, there I’ll be.’ Lord Justice Leveson said he wanted an investigation into how the man got into the court through special access, security-coded doors. He said: 'I would like to find out how this gentleman managed to access the court through what's supposed to be a secure corridor and I'll have an investigation undertaken about that immediately.' Mr Blair said: 'That's fine, can I just say for the record that what he said about Iraq and JP Morgan is completely untrue.' The man told reporters his name was David Lawley-Wakelin and he was from the Alternative Iraq Enquiry, He spoke as security guards escorted him through the Royal Courts of Justice. When the hearing resumed for the afternoon session, Lord Leveson said: 'Considerable effort has been put into ensuring all witnesses can give their evidence in a safe and secure environment and I very much regret what has happened. 'An investigation is being undertaken and I will be giving consideration to the steps that can be taken and should be taken against this particular intruder. 'Efforts will be redoubled to ensure that incidents of this nature don't recur. 'I repeat my apologies to Mr Blair and indeed to everyone else who was involved in or following our inquiry.' Mr Blair had been greeted by around two dozen or so protesters as he arrived at the courts. They waved banners reading 'Troops home', 'Bliar' and 'Afghanistan out'. The close relationship between Mr Blair and Rupert Murdoch was underlined by a list of contacts with newspaper editors and proprietors in the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. Three telephone calls were recorded between the pair on  11, 13 and 19 March 2003. He admitted to initiating one of them and that they lasted for now more than 45 minutes in total. He said: ‘I would have been wanting to explain what we are doing. I think I had similar calls with the Observer and the Telegraph. I don't think there's anything particularly odd about that when you're facing such an issue.’ In the run up to the 1997 general election in which Mr Blair took power for the first time, The Sun famously switched its allegiance from the Tory Party and became a vociferous cheerleader for the Iraq War. Earlier, Mr Blair cut a relaxed and smiling figure as he strode into the Royal Courts of Justice for his grilling at the Leveson Inquiry. Arrested: A second man was also held after an egg was thrown at Mr Blair's Range Rover as he left the High Court following his appearance before Lord Justice Leveson . Echoes: The interruption was an embarrassing echo of the 'custard pie' incident when Rupert Murdoch was attacked during a Commons Select Committee last year and his wife, Wendi Deng, leapt to his defence and slapped the attacker . Arriving in a black Range Rover at around 8.30am - a good hour and a half before the scheduled kick off - he waved at the assembled bank of press photographers as he entered through a side door of the London court. But outside the main entrance, the two dozen or so protesters who had gathered were not smiling. Waving banners reading 'Troops home', 'Bliar' and 'Afghanistan out', they greeted the former Prime Minister with an angry reception. Protest: Waving banners reading 'Troops home', 'Bliar' and 'Afghanistan out', about a dozen protesters greeted the former Prime Minister when he arrived at the hearing . Angry: Shouts of 'traitor' also came from the small but dogged crowd determined to pursue the ex-premier wherever he turned up . Furious: Outside the main entrance, the two dozen or so protesters who had gathered were not smiling . Mary Macmillan, a Fabian from Soho in London, carried a large knitted puppet of a judge bearing a sign on its chest reading 'Blair the day of judgment.' The 78-year-old said: 'I was a 1997 Labour Party person when Blair got his majority and I'm afraid he's proved a great let-down. 'We got very few things that he promised. The war in Afghanistan is the greatest treachery. 'I'm glad we could get here today because it's very difficult to get hold of Blair.' Earlier, Mr Blair cut a relaxed and smiling figure as he strode into the Royal Courts of Justice for his grilling at the Leveson Inquiry . Anti-war artist Chris Holden, 69, from London, repeated the familiar argument that the Iraq war - Blair's most controversial act in office - had been 'for the oil'. He asked: 'Why can't they just come out and say (it?)' Shouts of 'traitor' also came from the small but dogged crowd determined to pursue the ex-premier wherever he turned up. 'Truth and justice is the central message', Mr Holden said. But 'justice' for the perceived wrongs of the Iraq war was not on the bill for yesterday's hearing about Blair's relationship with the media.","Intruder was filmmaker and veteran Iraq War protester David Lawley-Wakelin .

They include the haunting portrait of a princess, ghostly scenes of the First World War and even an image of an old woman who transforms into a flock of birds with a swish of her cloak. The looped animations are the work of New York City-based art director Kevin Weir, who modifies historical black and white photographs, which he finds in the Library of Congress online archive, to create his animated scenes. He is drawn to ‘unknowable places and persons’ in the old images, This Is Colossal reported. Mr Weir, 26, began creating the strange GIFS during grad school and since then, his blogFlux Machine has become popular, attracting thousands of visitors. GIFS are a type of compressed file format with a limited colour palette that can be quickly transmitted over the internet. The animations are short in length and automatically repeat so the action is on a loop. In one of the GIFS, Princess Juliana starts a fire which sets the photo alight and peels away to reveal the original photographic portrait, before the action begins again. The original photograph was taken in around 1915 and belongs to the Bain Collection at the Library of Congress, where Mr Weir saw it and was inspired to create a GIF. Princess Juliana was born in 1909 and was Queen of the Kingdom of the Netherlands between 1948 and 1980. As an only child, her birth assured the royal family's survival. She spent her childhood at Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn, and at Huis ten Bosch Palace and Noordeinde Palace in The Hague, where she received her education at a fast pace so she was ready to succeed the throne at the age of 18. Mr Weir told The Guardian that the princess has an air of mystery, despite probably being a normal mischievous girl. ‘But something about the way these photographs are taken makes history unfamiliar to me. There is an unknowable quality to them.’ He said that some of the images are loaded with mysteries. ‘I sit with them for a while, just to see where they could go,’ explaining that it can take days for him to come up with a short animated story to transform an old photograph. Some of the stories are chilling, such as the soldier in the photo entitled ‘French 42cm gun’ where dust falls out from a barrel to the ground where it forms a new soldier who picks up the first fighter's lifeless body and drags it out of shot. Another shows a ruined tower that suddenly erupts with a shaft of light, propelling shadowy 'ghosts' into the air. In one GIF, ghostly creatures stalk the ruins of John A Roebling's steel works in Trenton, US, which supplied armaments and artillery chains to the Allies during the First World War. It is thought that a fire was started deliberately on January 18, 1915, which destroyed eight acres of factory as well as a block of workers' houses. While German forces and disaffected locals were blamed, it remains as mystery as to who started the destructive blaze. In another photograph, a mysterious cloud reveals a foreboding black figure watching over the cleaning up of the Great Fire of 1911 in Bangor, Maine. A small fire started in a shed and quickly spread out of control, destroying hundreds of homes and public buildings, however, remarkably, just two lives were lost. A portrait of Prince Henry of Prussia has been transformed by the artist, who shows the naval Admiral seemingly concentrating before shadows of himself emerge from his body. The Prince was a younger brother of German Emperor William II and held various positions in the Imperial German Navy, including Grand Admiral. At the beginning of World War One, Prince Henry was named Commander-in-Chief of the Baltic Fleet and when his mission ended, he left active duty with the dissolution of the monarchy in Germany. Mr Weir said that GIF animations enable him to use suspense and freeze particular moments in his surprising stories.","The GIFS are the work of New York City-based art director Kevin Weir .

"Half of British adults cannot be bothered to exercise, while one in four never eat fruit or vegetables, according to a shocking new study. Instead of sticking to the so-called 'five-a-day' rule and ensuring they are physically fit, many British adults choose to live on a junk food and sugary drink diet while doing little to burn off the calories. Despite a lackadaisical attitude towards their health, half of Britons say they are unhappy with their appearance, with most of those blaming a busy lifestyle and lack of money for their unhealthy diet. Unhealthy: Instead of sticking to the so-called 'five-a-day' rule and ensuring they are physically fit, many British adults choose to live on a junk food and sugary drink diet while doing little to burn off the calories . The shocking figures were revealed in Aviva’s Health Check UK report, which was released today. The study found that one in three 25 to 34-year-olds were officially overweight, with that figure rising to 50 per cent of all 35 to 44-year-olds. That figure improves slightly in the over-55 age range, where only a quarter are overweight. Despite a rising level of concern surrounding obesity in Britain, a third of those who fall into the category insist they were happy with their weight and feel fine physically. The lack of interest in taking care of . ones health stems from people prioritising their work and social life . over exercise and a good diet, according to Aviva UK Health medical . director Dr Doug Wright. 'The nation is falling woefully short of . hitting the five-a-day target of fruit and ­veg and too many people are . failing to fit proper exercise into their lives,' he told the Mirror. Fitness: While half of Britons admit they cannot be bothered to exercise, the same number say they are unhappy with their appearance . 'It’s about a subtle change in habits like swapping chocolate for an apple... Being ­overweight brings with it the potential for serious health ­conditions, yet people are living in denial by claiming they are in very good health,' he added. 'The risks are well known with ­conditions including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and even some types of cancer,' Dr Wright said. Last week it was revealed that super-sized . graves dedicated solely for obese people are set to be installed at a . cemetery amid fears of a growing ‘obesity crisis’. Plans . for 30 super-sized plots - which will be . near the road so undertakers don’t have far to carry the body - have been drawn up by council workers after . larger graves were requested by funeral directors struggling to haul coffins over long distances in Sutton Bridge, . Lincolnshire. Sutton . Bridge and Wingland Parish Council hopes to open a new three-acre . burial ground next year because space is running out at the cemetery in . the local church - where plots measure 9ft by 4ft.","Many British adults choose to live on junk food instead of a healthy diet .

"Hayley Leitch (pictured) asked husband Robin put his mother's pet in the bath . Often, people are jokingly described as 'clean freaks' or similar by their nearest and dearest but for some, living with crippling Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is no laughing matter. One such person, is mother-of-three Hayley Leitch who lived her whole life with OCD which was so debilitating it caused her to have constant thoughts that her family would be harmed if she did not carry out her cleaning rituals, which would see her scrubbing for hours on end and constantly rinsing her bare hands in bleach. For years her family did not realise Hayley, 29, from Grinstead, was suffering from the condition but her husband Robin began to gt an inkling when she demanded he wash the cat. She asked him to put his mother's pet in the bath when she saw her children were stroking it. He did and it scratched his . arm to pieces. He then realised she was ill but even that didn't make Hayley seek help. The condition started when she was just a young child. Nobody knew what it was and none of her three sisters suffered such behaviours. She was just four when her beloved Nanny Rose passed away. She . decided that by ritualistically jumping over the fish-pond she would be . able to stop anyone else in her family from leaving her. Unable to swim, this obsessive ritual nearly drowned her. 'I . don't know why I did it. The problem with OCD is it doesn't have any rules. For me it was just that, ""If I can make it to the other side then . everything would be fine"". 'It . was a coy carp fish pond so it was really big and really deep. Every . time that I would try to jump across it I would go under. It was . fortunate that I had sisters and my parents were around, so people were . around to help me.' 'It wasn't really . something that was spoken about back then. I didn't know why I was doing . it. I kind took it upon myself to think there was nothing wrong with . me and everyone else had the problem, they were dirty. I would blame . everyone else.' This early . experience set Hayley on a path of extreme and crippling OCD. When she . gave birth she refused to hold her babies due to fear of germs. 'It . happened with all three of them. With Calum I hadn't been diagnosed . and I couldn't go into hospital equipped to tell midwives ""It's not me . being a bad mum or not feeling love for my child"". Hayley (l) and sister Lauren and sitting in the sunshine as children, with the dreaded fishpond behind them . 'The thought of blood all over me was too much. 'Midwives . were taken back when I refused to hold him. When my OCD got to its . worst people sometimes confused it with me not loving my children, . but it's the opposite. The fear of them getting sick is overwhelming. 'It's . really difficult to discuss with people. I have thoughts about them . being murdered and my husband throwing them over the balcony. It's . because that would be my worst case scenario. If anything ever happened . to one of my kids I wouldn't carry on living.' Hayley, who starred on Channel 4's Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners, has now written a book, Coming Clean: Living With OCD, all about her life living with a consuming and crippling condition. She . would obsessively clean patches of the floor to prevent any harm coming . to her children, but would then forget to pick them up from nursery as . she found this task so absorbing. Hayley and Robin on their wedding day when she was still undiagnosed . She would wash her hands 60 times a day in neat bleach and her denial continued until the day her husband Robin, who works as a team leader at a medical supplies company, insisted she go to the doctors to seek help. They had both presumed that she had been suffering from post-natal depression until then. 'We were going to a family event and he rushed me out of the house, I was hitting him and I was crying. 'The . only way I can describe it is that I thought if he dragged me away from . bleaching the toilet I would get punished and something bad would . happen to the kids. I could almost see someone putting a gun to my kids' heads. I was hysterical.' Eventually Robin turned the car around and Hayley could get back to her ritual. Hayley enjoying a cosy moment at Center Parcs with her husband and three children . 'I went back into the bathroom, finished bleaching the toilet and I was fine. 'The following day he sat me down and said ""Do you think that was normal the way you were behaving yesterday?"" 'But I didn't understand. He realised this isn't right and booked me an appointment at the doctors. 'I . was very much in denial. There was a fear inside me of being stopped. I . felt so sure that if I didnt carry out these rituals that my children . would die. I was waiting for the inevitable to happen.' Eventually Hayley, a full-time mother to three children all under the age of ten, had a course of cognitive behavioural therapy and was put on a drug called fluoxetine. 'It's not one of those things where you're cured overnight,' says Hayley. 'It's . taken me years and years to get to the point where I am at now. After a . while I thought I was in control and stopped taking the medication. My . body started having spasms, my legs started shaking. I remember crying . to my husband and wondering what's wrong.' Even . after diagnosis and having taken medication for some time, the illness . continued to blight her life and nearly drove her to suicide. 'I ended up getting to point where I felt like I was a bad mum. I thought that I was mental,' she says. 'The . reason i wanted to take my own life is it got to the point where I was . cleaning for hours and hours. I was wrecking my hands washing in bleach. I was consumed by these thoughts and felt the only control I could have . was over whether to take my own life or not. 'Looking . at kitchen knives I thought about stabbing myself but worried about the . blood splattered on the floor. I was thinking of ""clean"" ways I could . do it and googling how many pills I would need to take. Enjoying a day at the beach with two of her boys (l) she wasn't keen to let Calum go on this ride on his own (r) 'It . happened after I was diagnosed. To begin with nothing seemed to change . or get better. I was at a point where I felt like I was going crazy . anyway. I was convinced my kids were going to get taken away from me. 'It . will be the first time - in the book - that some of my family members . would have heard of it. It's very much a secret illness which is why im . doing the book and the show, encouraging people that it is okay to talk . about it.' Hayley . eventually got weaned off her medication and is now using Rescue Remedy or Kalms. 'That . might not work for everyone but I'm at a place now where that's enough . to take the edge off. 'I eventually realised OCD is just a thought and you can't let it control your life. It bullies you and blackmails you.' And Hayley admits the OCD does creep back in. Coming Clean: Living With OCD is out now . 'Rightly or wrongly the bleach is very . much still a part of my life. I bleach my toilet all day every day . religiously. If I can't smell it in the bathroom I'll top it up . immediately. I take everything out the fridge and bleach it, too.' But her husband keeps Hayley in check. I'm quite lucky. When he's with me he is . quite key in seeing the signs. 'I sometimes don't realise if I'm washing my . hands several times, he'll remind me and I will then know that I need to reign it back in. 'If I panic over . something he'll say ""Hayley, it's just a thought""... he's good at reassuring . and reminding me.' And Hayley keeps an eye on her kids, too. 'My middle son won't share a drink or . utensils. I have been monitoring that. Having lived through OCD myself, I . wouldn't want him to go through that.' Coming Clean: Living With OCD by Hayley . Leitch with Veronica Clark is published by John Blake and is out now for £7.99. The new series of Channel 4's Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners starts in September.","Hayley Leitch, 29, from East Grinstead, has suffered OCD all her life .

"They always win at football, grab the deckchairs, drive gleaming muscle cars and work in a seemingly recession-proof country - but Germans are incapable of enjoying life. That is the finding of a study which says that the 'joy gene' in the Fatherland is broken. Rheingold, a market-research and consultancy institute based in Cologne, found that 46 per cent of Germans say they are increasingly unable to enjoy anything due to the stress of everyday life and the feeling of being constantly reachable - on the phone, the iPad, the computer. Glum: German chancellor Angela Merkel has endured many sleepless nights as she tackles the eurozone crisis . The difficulty was even more pronounced among the study's younger participants, 55 per cent claiming to feel they have lost their ability to 'feel good.' Whether it's with food, alcohol, holidays or relaxing -- Germans don't have the capacity to enjoy things - they can't even let go when they're having sex. According to the researchers; 'Our joy gene is increasingly defective - we've forgotten how to enjoy ourselves.' The highly personal interviews revealed that Germans can't let go during sex with many saying they constantly have film and advertising images run through their minds. 'This results in the requirement to cut a good figure even during sex,' Imdahl says. 'That is to say, holding in their bellies instead of enjoying the moment.' 'The results conform to the image that many Europeans have of Germans in this era of economic crisis as self-denying overachievers who can't even turn off the fun-brakes when vacationing at the beach,' said news magazine Der Spiegel. No joy: German Chancellor Angela Merkel watches as Bayern Munich are beaten by Chelsea in the Champions League and David Cameron, left, celebrates . 'The positive image that they enjoyed during the 2006 soccer World Cup in Germany seems gone.' 'At that time, Germans really radiated a zest for life,' says Rheingold psychologist Ines Imdahl. 'But this mood shifted beginning in 2008. 'The problem is that Germans feel weighed down by the ongoing European debt and currency crisis. It's more than simple complaining. People have the feeling that we have to shoulder the entire crisis here.' The common currency, however, doesn't shoulder all the blame - the main thing standing in their way is their own perfectionism. During hours of individual and group interviews, the researchers analysed how 60 subjects felt pleasure. They also surveyed 1,000 men and women. Among survey respondents, 81 percent said that they experience pleasure best when they have managed to achieve something first. 'As the saying goes, business before pleasure,' said 61-year-old female participant Wiltrud. German anguish: Bayern Munich's German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger reacts after missing a crucial penalty in their Champions League final against Chelsea . But this maxim doesn't seem to serve the Germans well - they even feel burdened by the pressure to enjoy things. 'People often told us that they would come home after a stressful day, but were unable to even say what they'd accomplished,' Imdahl reported. 'And then the people around them say, ""Hey, just relax."" Enjoyment then turns into an obligation.' Meanwhile the small pleasures of life - a glass of wine, a relaxing bubble bath, or a nice restaurant with delicious food - rankle with the Teutonic mind. 'This glut of offerings pressures people into thinking, 'I must enjoy everything',' Imdahl says. During the course of the study, the researchers managed to unlock a typically German sequence of steps to enjoyment, which they named 'pleasure DNA.' Feel good factor: Germans enjoyed themselves during the World Cup in 2006 - but with economic woes the national mood has worsened . The first step involves the feeling of having earned something. This is followed by preparation for the longed-for pleasure, such as booking a day of spa treatments. But then comes the biggest hurdle: letting go and clearing the mind. 'Only when a surprising positive moment supervenes can a fully integrated sense of enjoyment follow,' said Imdahl. 'But many Germans apparently lack crucial components to this pleasure DNA. Though some 91 per cent of the study participants said that pleasure makes life worthwhile, only 15 percent could recall moments in which they were able to forget their worries and feel 'truly happy.' And two thirds of those quizzed said happiness came at the expense of others - one motorbiker said he was 'delighted' when he blew exhaust fumes into an open topped car as he was stopped at traffic lights. Jealously also floats their boat. 'Many think, ""man, how does he do it"",' psychologist Imdahl said. 'It's a Teutonic mentality one can also see in the euro crisis. When we get agitated about the Greeks' high pensions and ample vacation days, naturally pleasure-jealousy plays a role,' she says. 'But Germans don't want to actually be Greeks. That wouldn't suit us.'","55% of young Germans said they were no longer able to 'feel good'

"We all have a favourite 'photo face' or pose, the expression/shape that we pull when someone whips out a camera in a bid to avoid unflattering social media snaps. Sadly, we're not always quick enough to get into position before a picture is taken that may haunt us in the online realm forever. So how do our favourite celebrities, who are followed by thousands of flashbulbs every time they step out in public, manage to get every picture right? Scroll down for video . Victoria Beckham is one celebrity who has mastered a signature pose, engineered to achieve the slimmest possible silhouette while showing off clothes to their best advantage . Stars such as Victoria Beckham, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Beyonce and Kim Kardashian never seem to be caught off guard when it comes to paparazzi shots. And that's because they have perfected a pose that  makes them look their best from most angles, and they execute it every time a lens is trained upon them. FEMAIL were keen to discover if we could master the A-listers' perfect posture and test whether or it really does make you look good wearing anything. We called on a posing coach and posture expert to teach our writer Deni Kirkova the tricks of the trade. Liz Lark, a yoga and postural expert from Champneys, whose clients include the English National Ballet, Indian Dance Company Sujata Bannerjee and Ralph Fiennes, gave FEMAIL an insight into each celebrity's pose before assisting Deni in perfecting each one. One glance at a photograph of Victoria Beckham, 40, posing nonchalantly on the red carpet and it looks pretty simple, right? Wrong. Look a little closer and you'll notice the pose - the lean back, one leg out and a slight head tilt. And it's not a one off. Victoria has spent years mastering her signature pose - and you'll notice it's the same at every photo opportunity. She's been at it for years! Obviously Victoria feels the pose works for her, she's been doing for five years. To achieve it, the slender designer pushes one hip - usually the right - out to the side to create an angular S-shaped curve with her body . The pose - known to every catwalk model and celebrity in the business - is engineered to achieve the slimmest possible silhouette, while showing off clothes to their best advantage. And Victoria has it nailed. 'Victoria has a lovely pose,' says Liz.  'I can't see any postural difficulties with Victoria, which means she's been trained well. She has mastered the anterior tilt of the pelvis, where the lumber curve of lower back is reduced.' Liz explains that by posing in this way, the figure is accentuated, improving the lower back curve and enhancing the glutes. To achieve it, the slender designer pushes one hip - usually the right - out to the side to create an angular S-shaped curve with her body. Her left foot is stepped slightly in front and crossed over the right, slimming her silhouette, enhancing the curve of her body and bringing her legs down to a neat point. Her right shoulder is pushed down and back, accentuating the 'couture curve' of her body, and her right arm is held behind her to narrow the profile further. Her head is always held straight and high to elongate her neck, her chin tipped down to slim the face, or held up and back to create a firm, youthful jawline and lengthen the neck. Before and after: FEMAIL writer Deni Kirkova is pictured, left, before attempting the VB pose and, right, after. Liz taught her how to perfect the anterior tilt of the pelvis, where the lumber curve of lower back is reduced. Liz explains that by posing in this way, the figure is accentuated, improving the lower back curve and enhancing the glutes, right (dress by www.wantherwardrobe.com) Beyonce is another celebrity who always manages to look picture perfect thanks to her signature pose. The singer, 33, has mastered the 'double grab', which Liz says exudes confidence and draws attention to her petite waist. Placing her hands on her hips helps flatter her arms and the slight lift of her pubic bones steadies her centre, says Liz. 'Her stance is so well centred that it highlights her hourglass figure perfectly and makes her look graceful and feminine,' she added. Hourglass: Beyonce, 33, has mastered the 'double grab', which Liz says exudes confidence and draws attention to her petite waist . Making like Bey: Deni tested out Beyonce's pose and loved how it made her dress, arms and stomach, look far more shapely (dress by Jessica Wright for Lipstick Boutique) Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has adopted a pose similar to Queen Bey's. The X Factor judge does, however, place one hand higher on her hips on one side. This, says Liz, helps to add curves and definition to her petite frame. 'As always, Cheryl looks lovely and effortless, but a fair amount of work goes into looking this good on the red carpet. 'Notice she knocks her right knee in, and weakens her outer thigh, adding shape to her physique and making her body ""pop"".' Hippy: Cheryl Fernandez Versini always puts on hand higher on one side of her hip, which Liz says makes her body 'pop' - she also puts more weight on one leg, which flatters them . Adding shape: Deni tested out Cheryl's signature pose and, as you can see from the after snap, right, it gave her body more shape and flattered her legs (dress by Nicole Scherzinger for Missguided) As one of the world's most photographed women, Kim Kardashian has got her pose down. Clearly designed to highlight her shapely derriere, the 33-year-old reality TV star often poses by looking over her shoulder, with her back arched and hand on placed on her lower back, just above her iconic bottom, or coyly placed on her cheek. 'Kim's pose is just fabulous,' mused Liz. 'The key here is activating her thoracic (mid back), by arching it slightly and making it look more curved. This also helps to extend the upper portion of her spine. 'By glancing over her shoulder, she is clearly showing off what she sees as her best side.' Kim clearly knows how to work her best angles. She's been showcasing the over-the-shoulder pose since her first appearance on the red carpet - and it's still working a treat. Keeping up with Kim: Clearly designed to highlight her shapely derriere, Kim Kardashian often poses by looking over her shoulder, with her back arched, showing off her shapely behind to perfection . Shaping up: While Deni isn't blessed with a bottom like Kim's, Liz taught her how to make the most of hers - although it took her a few attempts to pull off the over-the-shoulder stance with aplomb (dress by www.wantherwardrobe.com) Giving Kim a run for her money is showbiz stalwart Jennifer Lopez, who has mastered her red carpet pose: the left lean. Speaking about the 45-year-old's pose, Liz said: 'Her standing leg is hyper-extended (or locked at the knee), which strengthens the legs and makes them appear longer and more toned. 'She also engages her core by leaning slightly to the left, lifting her pelvic floor and engaging her lower abdominal muscles. This pose takes some serious practice but it really pays off. 'Altogether, this stabilises her body and cultivates confidence. She looks gorgeous.' Left lean: Jennifer Lopez has perfected her pose, which sees her lean to the left, extend her leg out and exude some serious confidence . Like Lopez: Deni, pictured before and after, loved pulling off J-Lo's pose and felt it highlighted her curves and made the dress look much better (dress by www.wantherwardrobe.com) A celebrity who Liz feels doesn't quite master the perfect pose is Lady Gaga, whose awkward pose matches her taste for avant garde fashion. Liz said: 'How very strange this pose is! Her shoulders are hunched up, she needs to roll the shoulders away from her ears and release the shoulders downwards, opening the chest. 'She should rotate the upper arms externally, to avoid ""penguin"" arms, which closes the chest and makes her appear less confident. 'As for her knees, they appear to be knocking together. She needs to place the feet hip width wide before bending the front leg knee, to keep her body grounded.' Odd: Lady Gaga has an awkward pose that matches her taste for avant garde fashion. Liz said: 'How very strange this pose is! Her shoulders are hunched up, which makes her appear insecure' Unimpressed: Deni felt she looked better before attempting the Lady Gaga pose - and certainly won't be trying this one out at the next photo opportunity (dress by www.wantherwardrobe.com) FIND YOUR FEET: Imagine you are standing on a trampoline. Ground the four corners of your feet into the earth and unlock your knee joints, as if the earth feels springy beneath you. MICRO BEND KNEES: Slightly bend your knees, which will activate the leg muscles and therefore give more shapely legs . NEUTRALISE PELVIS: Tilt the pelvis forward and back, like a belly dancer, and find the middle place between the two: this will stabilise the centre and begin to active the core . AVOID PUSHING TAILBONE DOWN TO FLOOR: This will loosen the lumbar (lower back) curve and give you a beautiful shape, which will enhance your glutes . ACTIVATE THE CENTRE: Draw the navel to the spine, gently draw your lower belly inwards, on exhalations, slightly lift the pelvic floor on exhalations . LENGTHEN THE SPINE: Lift the ribcage above the pelvis, elevate the heart and line up the pelvic floor with the crown of the head . SHIFT WEIGHT FROM FOOT TO FOOT, ROCK FORWARD AND BACK: This will realign the body and awaken energy, unlocking knees . BREATHE!!!!!! Especially exhalations out of the mouth to release stress . ROLL SHOULDERS BACK, RELEASE SHOULDER BLADES DOWNWARDS: Open the chest and smile from armpit to armpit . ROTATE THE UPPER ARMS EXTERNALLY, TO OPEN CHEST: Present yourself to the world, avoid the ‘penguin’ effect .

"A rare and valuable copy of William Shakespeare's First Folio - the first-ever compilation of the Bard's plays - has been uncovered in a provincial library in France. The 1623 book, which is one of the most coveted in the world, lay undiscovered among hundreds of others in St-Omer, near Calais, for some 400 years. Worth up to £3.5 million ($5.5 million), it was discovered when librarian Remy Cordonnier dusted off a book of Shakespeare's works for an exhibition. Hidden in plain sight: A rare and valuable copy of William Shakespeare's First Folio (pictured), the first-ever compilation of the Bard's plays, has been uncovered in a provincial library in northern France . Because it is in English, it is thought that French readers overlooked the work, despite its huge literary importance. 'It occurred to me that it could be an unidentified First Folio, with historic importance and great intellectual value,' Mr Cordonnier told AFP. Shakespeare received comparatively little acclaim for his work up until his death in 1616 but, seven years later, two of his best friends, John Heminge and Henry Condell, produced a collection of 36 of his plays. Known as the First Folio, it was an authentic record of comedies, histories and tragedies which originally sold for £1 ($1.60). It was designed, according to the editors, 'only to keep the memory of so worthy a friend and fellow alive, as was our Shakespeare'. It is believed that the copy found in France was taken to Saint-Omer by English refugees from Anglican persecution, said Mr Cordonnier. The copy of the book, which was published seven years after Shakespeare's death, was authenticated on Saturday by First Folio expert Eric Rasmussen from the University of Nevada. 'It is the 231st copy found in the world and the second in France,' said Mr Cordonnier. The book, a compilation of 36 of Shakespeare's plays, is in good condition but missing about 30 pages, including the title page, which could explain how it went unnoticed for centuries. Dr Rasmussen wrote a book on the First Folio called The Shakespeare Thefts, detailing his thrilling global hunt for what remains of the initial 750 copies of the book, a favourite for thieves across the centuries. He describes 'run-ins with heavily tattooed criminal street gangs in Tokyo, bizarre visits with eccentric, reclusive billionaires, and intense battles of wills with secretive librarians,' according to the publisher. Delicate: The First Folio was an authentic record of comedies, histories and tragedies, including The Tempest . Restored: Dr Rasmussen wrote a book on the First Folio called The Shakespeare Thefts, detailing his thrilling global hunt for what remains of the initial 750 copies of the book, a favourite for thieves . Uncovered: From left to right, Bruno Humetz, François Decoster (both from the Conseiller régional Nord-Pas de Calais) and librarian Rémy-Cordonnier look at the folio . Rare: The book, a compilation of 36 of Shakespeare's plays, is in good condition but missing about 30 pages, including the title page, which could explain how it went unnoticed for centuries . Dr Rasmussen's book speaks of several First Folios, which have had pages ripped out of them, and one with a bullet lodged in it. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington said on its website that the First Folio is the only source for 18 of Shakespeare's plays, including Macbeth, 'which would otherwise be lost.' Shakespeare received comparatively little acclaim for his work up until his death in 1616 but, seven years later, two of his best friends, John Heminge and Henry Condell, produced a collection of 36 of his plays. Known as the First Folio, it was an authentic record of comedies, histories and tragedies which originally sold for £1 ($1.60). It was designed, according to the editors, 'only to keep the memory of so worthy a friend and fellow alive, as was our Shakespeare'. Was Shakespeare depressed? Simon Russell Beale, who played King Lear in Sam Mendes production at the National Theatre, left, says the Bard, right, must have 'temporarily lost faith in human nature' William Shakespeare was probably depressed when he wrote King Lear, featured in the First Folio, and decided to change its ending at the last minute to kill off all the major characters, experts have said. Simon Russell Beale, who played the main character in Sam Mendes' recent production at the National Theatre, said it is so 'savage' the Bard must have been going through a 'bad patch'. Shakespeare's celebrated tragedy, written between 1605 and 1606, ends with Lear collapsing and dying on top of his daughter Cordelia, after she is hanged. Throughout the play, Lear's empire and his own health declines as he suffers disaster after disaster while deceitful, conniving and murderous characters help destroy his life. Mr Beale, who has considered Shakespeare's state of mind for the BBC Four documentary The Secret Life of Books, said the playwright must have 'temporarily lost faith in human nature'. He wrote Lear at the same time as Timon of Athens, and describes them both as 'savage'. 'So perhaps, I'm suggesting, he himself was depressed. He temporarily lost faith in human nature.It must have been very depressing to write. It's as if Shakespeare can't stop this flow of invective and bile.' There was an engraved portrait of Shakespeare on the title page - one of the very few which have allowed people to get any idea of what the so-called 'Bard of Avon' actually looked like. It is believed that the copy found in France was taken to Saint-Omer by English refugees from Anglican persecution, said Mr Cordonnier. Library director Francoise Ducroquet said France would not sell the book, and that it would be stored in the library's safe with other precious items.

"Secret: The husband of Anna Allison, pictured, who was killed on 9/11 visited Guantanamo Bay to try and save the lives of the Al-Qaeda terrorists behind the attack . The husband of a woman who was killed when her plane smashed into the World Trade Centre on 9/11 visited Guantanamo Bay to try and save the lives of the men suspected of being behind the attack. Blake Allison, 62, held a secret hour-long meeting last week with the lawyers of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed and four of his accomplices. Incredibly, during the extraordinary meeting he offered to testify in court against the death penalty being used against the men. The wine-company executive is a vocal critic of capital punishment and said he wants the U.S government to spare the lives of the five men - even if they are convicted of a host of death-penalty charges. Speaking to the New York Post, he said: 'The public needs to know there are family members out there who do not hold the view that these men should be put to death. 'We can’t kill our way to a peaceful tomorrow.' He added: 'Just because I was hurt very badly and personally does not, in my mind, give me the go-ahead to take a life.' Mr Allison's wife Anna, 48, was travelling to Los Angeles for work when the American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into Tower 1 at the World Trade Centre. Mr Allison - from New Hampshire - has admitted his late wife's relatives or other victims' family members do not share his view. He also says he believes Khalid Sheik . Mohammed, Waleed bin Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi have no remorse and would commit the same atrocities . again. His meeting with the terrorists' lawyers took place on May 4. Controversial: Blake Allison, 62, pictured second right on back row, held a secret hour-long meeting last week with the lawyers of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed and four of his accomplices . Mastermind: A courtroom sketch of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, right, with his civilian attorney David Nevin at Guantanamo Bay on Saturday May 5 . Mr Allison, who has remarried, said despite opposing the death penalty, this does not mean he wants the men behind the devastating attack not to be brought to justice. But he said he believes it is wrong to take a life. He says he has been against the death penalty for decades, before his wife was murdered. Mr Allison has also previously testified on behalf of 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. He was the 20th hijacker who faced the death penalty but was instead sentenced to life in prison. A total of 2,976 people were murdered during the day of attacks in 2001 after hijacked airliners were flown into New York’s World Trade Centre and the Pentagon in Washington. Tense: A courtroom sketch showing, top from left to right, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ammar al Baluchi, Ramzi Binalshibh, Walid bin Attash and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed at their military hearing with 9/11 victims' family members observing . Secure: The U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay in Cuba is holding a number of terrorist suspects . The grieving relatives of 9/11 victims were left furious earlier this month when a preliminary hearing for the five men descended into farce. The men deliberately disrupted what should have been a short hearing, dragging it out for 13 hours. Proceedings were repeatedly interrupted as the men knelt in prayer, flicked through a copy of The Economist, refused to use headphones and insisted the 123 pages of charges they face were read aloud. Captured: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is the self-proclaimed mastermind of 9/11 . Their antics in a top-security military court in Guantanamo Bay were watched by the relatives, who had attended the court and watched live feeds at military bases in several U.S. cities. Jim Riches, whose fireman son, Jimmy, died at the World Trade Centre, said: ‘It’s actually a joke, it feels ridiculous. It looks like it’s going to be a very long trial.’ Debra Burlingame, whose brother, Charles, was the pilot of the plane that flew into the Pentagon, added: ‘They’re engaging in jihad in a courtroom. Khalid Sheik Mohammed is a Pakistani citizen who grew up in Kuwait and attended . college in Greensboro, North Carolina. He has acknowledged to military . authorities that he was responsible for the September 11 attacks 'from A to . Z,' as well as about 30 other plots, and that he personally killed Wall . Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. He was captured in 2003 in Pakistan. Ramzi Binalshibh is a Yemeni, who was allegedly . chosen to be a hijacker but couldn't get a U.S. visa and ended up . providing assistance such as finding flight schools. Waleed bin Attash, also from Yemen, allegedly ran an Al Qaeda training . camp in Afghanistan and researched flight simulators and timetables. Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi is a Saudi who allegedly helped . the hijackers with money, Western clothing, travellers' cheques and credit . cards. Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali is a Pakistani national and nephew of Mohammed, who . allegedly provided money to the hijackers. 'My brother was murdered in the cockpit of his airplane, and we will have to stand up for him.’ Eddie Bracken, from Staten Island, said he gone to Cuba to look straight at the accused terrorists. He lost his sister, a mother of two, who worked as a secretary on the 105th floor of the south tower. As one of them, Binalshibh entered the court, he smiled at Mr Bracken and gave him a thumbs-up. Mr Bracken told the accused: 'I came a long way to see you, eye to eye.' It is the second attempt to prosecute the self-proclaimed mastermind of the atrocities, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and four others. Mohammed, 47, who has admitted being the architect of the attacks, appeared in public for the first time in three years for the arraignment hearing – which will have to be held again so the defendants can enter pleas. Mohammed is being tried alongside Waleed bin Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi. If convicted, the men could face the death penalty but the trial is unlikely to take place for at least another 12 months. At the arraignment hearing, the judge was deluged with questions about his qualifications to hear the case. There were also complaints that the accused were not allowed to wear clothes supplied by their lawyers. Regular meal and prayer breaks further delayed proceedings and at one point all five men refused to take part and passed around a copy of The Economist magazine. They ignored the judge, wouldn’t listen to Arabic translations over their headphones and asked for lengthy court documents to be read aloud, adding two hours to the case. Charged: Waleed Bin Attash, left, and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi are also suspected of carrying out the 9/11 attacks . Mohammed took off his earphones . providing an Arabic translation and refused to answer questions or . acknowledge he understood them before dozing off. Bin Attash was locked to a restraint chair when he came into court and released only after he promised to behave. The only defendant to break his silence was Binalshibh who prayed alongside his defence table before launching into a tirade in which he claimed to be in danger. In a mixture of broken English and Arabic he compared the Guantanamo Bay commander to Colonel Gadaffi, the former Libyan dictator, and claimed that he had been threatened. In court: Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, left, and Ramzi Binalshibh are also accused of helping carry out the worst terrorist attack in America's history .","Blake Allison held a meeting with the lawyers of Khalid Sheik Mohammed and four of his accomplices .

"Tipping the scales at 32st and living on a diet of pizza and chips but too scared to sleep in case she stopped breathing, 28-year-old Ana Sirbu knew she had to do something about her weight. One year on, the Romanian former pizza chef, who lives in York, looks nothing like her heavyweight former self and is now a slim size 14, after embarking on a healthy diet and fitness regime. 'Before I lost the weight, I felt trapped in my own body,' she says. 'I couldn't be myself as I couldn't move or do anything I wanted to do. Scroll down for video . Big improvement: Ana before losing weight (left) and right, after shedding an impressive 18st . Unhealthy: At 32st, Ana was too scared to sleep for fear of dying in the night because of her weight . 'But now I feel free. I feel like I can do absolutely anything I wasn't to do and I can be as active as I want.' Ana's problems began five years ago, when a combination of lengthy shifts, a fondness for pizza and comfort eating resulted in slow but steady weight gain. Her habit of tucking into piles of carb-laden Italian food at 5am at the end of her shifts didn't help and before long, Ana realised that she was tipping the scales at a mighty 32st. 'The funny thing is, I wouldn't even say that I had an obsession with food or anything like that,' she explains. 'I simply ate the wrong things at the wrong time, for example at 5am in the morning when I got in from work before going to sleep, which is not healthy at all.' Ana, who says she was 'normal-sized' as a child, was left unable to work out because her weight made it hard to breathe and even found doing daily chores difficult. 'My weight affected everything in my life,' she remembers. 'I couldn't do the housework; I couldn't even walk to the corner shop to buy a loaf of bread. 'I even got turned down for a job because of my size – the manager telling me that they couldn't have anyone working in their kitchen as big as me.' Bad habits: Ana (pictured far left) says odd working hours contributed to her piling on the pounds . Change: Ana, who now weighs 13st, says she was unable to do chores at her largest (left) but can now (right) 'I was so depressed and exhausted that I got to the point where I couldn't even leave the house,' she says. 'I think the most terrifying point of it all was struggling to breathe. 'At 32st, I couldn't sleep - so much so that my boyfriend would have to wake up in the middle of the night just to check that I was still alive. It was a really scary time for everyone.' Finally, in a frenzy of fear for her health, Ana decided that the time had come to lose weight and enrolled on a slimming programme. Svelte: Now a slimline size 14, Ana says the world is her oyster and hopes to get her dream job soon . Instead of tucking into heavy pizza and chips, she replaced normal eating with four specially formulated food packs per day and attended weekly counselling sessions.' Her strict diet continued for a year and by the end, Ana had lost 18st. Now eating normally - if more healthily - once more, Ana says that the combination of counselling and shedding the pounds has changed her life for the better. 'LighterLife was the  programme that was right for me a the right time and I think this is by and large because of the counselling,' she explains. 'You have be motivated to do LighterLife but sitting with a group of people and a counsellor who really understands you and the way you are feeling is invaluable.' Having totally transformed her appearance and her health, Ana says her weight loss has also had a huge impact on the people around her. 'I go jogging every day which I absolutely love - I can't believe that I struggled to even walk around my house before. I go bike riding and I absolutely love to dance. 'I don't think I could have done it without the support of my family,' she continues. 'My boyfriend was absolutely amazing. He loved me the way I was and was always supportive but my unhappiness made him unhappy and didn't allow us to lead the life we wanted to. 'Now when he looks at me I can see him just explode with happiness, he is so so proud of me. 'My mother was always very worried for my health as was the rest of my family. I promised my father that the next time he would see me that I would be a completely different person and I didn't let him down. 'When I saw him last year after I had lost the weight – he just started crying. I was still his daughter, but a million times happier and healthier.' Ana, who has since given up her role as a pizza chef, says that she is certain to find another now she is healthy once more. 'I needed to leave my job and make a new start,' she says. 'I feel so powerful and confident that the world is my oyster I can do absolutely anything that I want to do and will find the job of my dreams.'","Ana Sirbu, 28, from York, shed an impressive 18st in a single year .
