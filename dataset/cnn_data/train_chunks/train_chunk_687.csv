A zookeeper has been suspended after allegedly punching a seal when it struggled as handlers tried to weigh it. The South American fur seal put up a fight as staff tried to lift it on to a weighing machine during a routine health check. But bosses at Bristol Zoo Gardens have now launched an investigation after it emerged a senior animal keeper punched the seal to keep it still. Investigation: A senior animal keeper has been suspended after allegedly punching a South American fur seal (similar to this one pictured at Bristol Zoo Gardens) when it struggled as staff tried to weigh it . The zoo's head vet has examined all the seals at the popular tourist attraction and the seal is believed to have made a full recovery. All the seals remain on public show in their enclosure. A Bristol Zoo Gardens spokeswoman said: 'A senior animal keeper at Bristol Zoo Gardens has been suspended pending further investigation of an alleged animal welfare incident that has recently come to light. Bristol Zoo Gardens was founded in 1835 by a group of eminent local citizens and opened to the public a year later - making 2013 its 177th anniversary. It has around 165 staff and more than 300 volunteers to run its activity centre and animal encounter sessions, and to care for more than 400 different specials of animals. As well as being home to South American fur seals, the zoo also has African penguins, flamingos, Pygmy hippos, Asiatic Lions, Red Pandas, meerkats, as well as a bug world, butterfly forest and an aquarium. 'As this is an ongoing investigation, Bristol Zoo is currently unable to discuss the details of the incident. 'However, the zoo has acted rapidly and comprehensively by instigating an immediate, formal and extensive investigation in line with its internal policies and legal welfare requirements. 'Michelle Barrows, head of veterinary services, has examined the seal family and all individuals are behaving normally, engaging happily and playfully with keepers and guests in their enclosure. 'The animal has been, and continues to be, on full public show. 'Bristol Zoo would like to make it very clear that it has a zero tolerance towards such behaviour and takes its commitment to the highest standards of animal welfare and conservation seriously.'

Missing: Miller Redpath, 18, above, vanished from his home on August 13, sparking the police investigation which led to the discovery of the body yesterday . Police have admitted that a body found in an overgrown rear garden at the home of missing public schoolboy Miller Redpath is likely to be his decomposed remains. A post mortem on the body by a Home Office pathologist has been unable to determine the cause of death which is still being treated by police as unexplained. The 18-year-old disappeared from his home almost two months ago have found a body in the property’s overgrown back garden. He was last seen by his mother Anastasia Miller at their house on August 13. Ms Miller woke him up in the morning so they could attend an open-air Christian service together but found him ‘grumpy’ in bed and left without him. When accountant Ms Miller returned home, she found items missing from their detached Victorian home in Wenhaston, in Southwold, Suffolk, and her son gone. But she said she was not immediately worried because he had a habit of ‘making unannounced departures’. However, when he failed two days later to pick up his A-level results from £21,105-a-year Langley School, in Loddon, Norfolk, where he was a weekly boarder, she was more concerned. On August 16, she reported the theft to police and mentioned her son’s disappearance. Officers searched the house and garden but failed to find anything. It was only on October 15 that police formally recorded the teenager as a missing person after Mrs Miller, 56, and officers investigating the theft raised concerns. Police carried out a second search nine days later, on Thursday afternoon, and found a body in the ‘overgrown rear garden’ at the family’s ivy-covered home. Grim discovery: Officers found the body in the rear garden of Miller's home in Wenhaston, Suffolk, above . Crime scene: The family home of Miller Redpath and Anastasia Miller is now the scene of a police investigation as they try to identify the decomposed corpse . The death is being treated as ‘unexplained’ by police and the house and garden – which is largely hidden by trees and bushes – have been cordoned off while the area is examined by crime scene officers. A Suffolk police spokesman said  a post-mortem examination will  take place to confirm whether or not the body is that of the missing teenager. Questions could now be raised about the initial police search and why there was a nine-day gap between Miller being reported missing and the second search. A spokesman for Suffolk Police confirmed the matter had been referred to the IPCC. Plea: Miller's mother has been appealing for any information on her son's whereabouts since his disappearance ten weeks ago . During a press conference last week, . Mrs Miller recalled how she began to worry when she realised her son had . not taken his passport, bank cards, phone charger, a jacket or any . money. She spoke to the . local media to plead for information from anyone who had seen him and . distributed pictures of the teenager around the town. Appealing directly to Miller last week she said: ‘I’m really worried about your safety and well-being and I just hope that everything’s okay. ‘If you’re in trouble in any way, just remember there’s very little that can’t be sorted out with some goodwill, negotiation and a humble heart. Investigation: Police were searching the house as part of the missing person investigation . Ambitious: Miller was said to be thinking about going to university in London after taking A Levels at co-educational Langley School in Loddon, Norfolk . Appeal: Miller's mother Anastasia, has led the search for her son, issuing appeals in the local media . 'You’re certainly not in any trouble with me. I just need you to get in touch.’ Mrs Miller, who runs an estate agency . in Eastern Europe, also trawled the streets of Ipswich and Norwich . looking for any sign of her son and speaking to homeless people to ask . if they had seen him. She . said before the discovery of a body: ‘There’s a cold dark place in my . heart that I’ve got to keep pushing back so that I can focus on the hope . that he’s alive and we’ll see him again.’ She added: ‘Everything was on track for him as he was doing well at school, he was thinking of London University, had lots of friends and I just don’t understand what happened.’ Suffolk Police said last week that they believed Miller had left the house ‘of his own free will’, but that there were ‘concerns for his well-being’. The teenager was a keen singer and a member of the Waveney Light Opera’s Rising Stars group in  Beccles, Suffolk. The group’s chairman, Chris Steed, said Miller was ‘a bit of a loner’ but ‘always reliable … extremely polite and well thought of by everyone’. He added: ‘I am gutted about the discovery of this body. We have got a meeting of our group tonight and I will be stuck for words.’","Student Miller Redpath, 18, went missing from his home on August 13 .

Plans to build floating hotels on the Persian Gulf have been put forward to help provide accommodation for the influx of visitors expected in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. Qatari authorities have been in talks with a Finnish architecture firm over plans to develop the space-saving floating hotels before the tournament in nine years' time. Organisers are already planning to spend £65billion on air-conditioned stadiums to counter the soaring summer heat, while there have also been plans to blot out the sun with artificial clouds. Qatar is in talks with a Finnish architecture firm over plans to develop space-saving floating hotels as it prepares for an influx of visitors for the World Cup 2022 . The hotels are planned to be built off the coast of Doha, on the Persian Gulf . They will form part of the Oryx Island, which will also feature luxury villas and a water park . And they are now considering developing Oryx Island, which will consist of the floating hotels alongside luxury villas and a water park, off the coast of Doha, in the Persian Gulf, according to ArchDaily. Sigge Architects have said the Qatari authorities were interested in the concept because of its sustainability and green credentials. The firm developed the floating hotel with the Almaco Group of Finland, ConstructionWeekOnline has reported. The Almaco website states that a floating hotel is 'a great alternative for areas where all land is fully developed and/or difficult to develop'. Water taxis, ferries and private boats will be used to transport the development's 25,000 visitors to the mainland. The hotel, which could be completed in seven or eight years, will also have its own sewage treatment plant, recycling facilities and will be able to generate its own power.

UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino last week added his voice to growing calls for the tournament to be played in winter, saying it should be held when the weather is most suitable. Despite plans to build air-conditions stadiums to counter the heat, which can reach 50C, there has still been pressure from some within the football world to play the tournament at a different time of year. Europe's major leagues, with the Premier League leading, are opposed to the idea as it would mean substantial changes to the schedule but Infantino has followed in the footsteps of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and UEFA chief Michel Platini backing the proposal. Meanwhile, there have also been plans to blot out the sun with artificial clouds in a bid to provide shade for stadiums and training grounds during the sweltering summer.

A report has suggested some of the German players may have been doped . West Germany's footballers who played in the 1966 World Cup Final against England may have been injected with drugs as part of a government-funded doping scheme, a study has suggested. A report by German researchers claims that West Germany's athletes were systematically doped with government backing during the 1970s, and possibly as early as the 1950s. Leaked extracts from the unpublished 800-page report titled 'Doping in Germany from 1950 to today' were published by German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Saturday. According to the report, one unnamed interior minister said at the time: 'Our athletes should have the same conditions and services as the Eastern Bloc athletes.' Researchers said West German doping did . not evolve as a response to East Germany's systematic doping under the . Communist government, but operated parallel to it. The report claimed that for many years the . state financed experiments with performance-enhancing substances such as . anabolic steroids, testosterone, oestrogen or the blood-doping agent . EPO. It did not say when the experiments ended. It stated that an unspecified . number of footballers in the 1954 World Cup-winning team received . 'Vitamin C' injections, which were actually the methamphetamine Pervitin - commonly known as . speed. Amphetamines were used by German . soldiers during World War II and their continued use in German football . from the end of the 1940s became 'normal', according to the study. As well as researchers finding alleged evidence of drugs being used by the 1954 World Cup team, they also said 'traces' of the banned stimulant ephedrine was found in three unnamed German . players at the 1966 World Cup. But it was claimed the drug could have accidentally been taken when players used a decongestant for colds. Three West German players were found to have traces of the banned stimulant ephedrine in tests after the 1966 final. (There is no suggestion that any players pictured knew about or were involved in doping) England beat West Germany 4-2 in the final at Wembley Stadium in 1966 . England beat West Germany 4-2 in the final, with Geoff Hurst scoring England's disputed third goal. Sueddeutsche Zeitung also said that . German athletes received around 1,200 injections of Berolase and . thioctacid at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. The substances were not banned at the . time and were supposed to improve performance, but their effects had been . untested. Women and children were also doped with anabolic steroids, despite concerns over their long-term effects, the report said. A Dr Joseph Keul of Freiburg, who died in 2000, allegedly tested the effects of anabolic steroids on boys as young as 11. The report was put together by researchers at Berlin's Humboldt University on behalf of the German Olympic Sports Confederation, with Giselher Spitzer as the project leader. It was completed in April, but has yet to be published because of privacy concerns and legal issues over naming athletes, doctors and politicians. West Germany's World Cup-winning 1954 team were injected with 'Vitamin C' which was actually speed, the report claimed. (There is no suggestion that any players pictured knew about or were involved in doping) The report claimed the conditions for . 'systemic doping' were laid in 1970 when the Federal Institute of Sport . Science (BISp) was founded under jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry, . which is still responsible for sports, but that doping in Germany . existed long before. The . BISp provided funding for research into doping substances for years, . with sports medicine facilities in Freiburg, Cologne and Saarbruecken . among the main recipients, the report said. 'There's . a systemic connection between research and forbidden substances and in . using them for athletes,' Spitzer, the project leader for the report, . told The Associated Press. 'That's why we call it systemic doping.' The Interior Ministry said it has a 'great interest in completely clearing up and evaluating the doping past in both parts of Germany'. German Athletics president Clemens Prokop called for names to be revealed, 'especially of those who are still involved in sport'. Last Tuesday, the Main-Post and Maerkische Oderzeitung newspapers reported that the BISp funded experiments in Freiburg on the performance of anabolic steroids before the 1972 Olympic Games, citing a file from the Federal Archives in Koblenz. Drugged: Shot-putter Heidi Krieger was systematically doped from the age of 16 . East Germany carried out a doping programme on its athletes for decades. Drugs, largely anabolic steriods, were given to athletes, often without their knowledge. Trainers and coaches gave pills and injections to sportsmen and women, many of whom were told they were just vitamins. The drugs caused fast muscle build-up and quick recovery times, leading to the country seeing huge success at the Olympic Games of the 1970s and 80s and other international events. But the steroids had severe side-effects including causing heart problems, cancer and infertility. Around 800 athletes are believed to have developed serious problems as a result of the doping. Shot-putter Heidi Krieger (pictured aged 21) was systematically drugged with anabolic steriods from the age of 16. She did not know she was being drugged and developed many male characteristics. At the age of 31, the shot-putter underwent a sex change to become a man named Andreas. Krieger had retired by the age of 24, in part because of the damage caused to his body from lifting huge weights while on steroids.","Report claims state-sponsored doping programme ran in West Germany as well as Eastern Bloc .

She has been dubbed the Princess Diana of the Middle East, combining beauty and style with tireless charity work. In a region blighted by dictatorships and conflicts, the First Lady of Syria, Asma al-Assad, was billed as the modern and caring face of the Arab world. But emails obtained by WikiLeaks show Mrs Assad, 36, spent £270,000 buying furniture from an exclusive London store for one of her presidential palaces last March – as Syria was descending into a bloody civil war. British-born Mrs Assad sent her order – which included five chandeliers costing £8,800 – to upmarket furniture store DN Designs in the King’s Road, Chelsea, West London. The emails, seen exclusively by The Mail on Sunday, emerged as more than 200 people were believed to have been massacred by government forces in the village of Tremseh last Thursday. It is estimated that more than 16,000 have been killed in Syria since the uprising began last March, including women and children caught in the crossfire between government troops and rebels. But as innocent civilians were being killed, the emails show that Mrs Assad did not drop plans to refurbish the summer palace, where she and her husband go to escape the scorching desert heat. Mrs Assad – who was once described by Vogue magazine as a ‘rose in the desert’ – took personal charge of furnishing the palace in the coastal town of Latakia, 200 miles north of the capital Damascus. The full scale of the palace, which offers breathtaking views of the Mediterranean, is unknown, but based on the order Mrs Assad placed, it has a grand entrance hall on the ground floor with an adjoining reception room. On the first floor, there is a dining room that can seat at least ten people, as well as a majlis – a traditional Arab room that is used for entertaining guests – and a salon or drawing room. Mother-of-three Mrs Assad also ordered furniture for two family rooms, a basement hall and a ladies’ lobby. Bloodshed: A Syrian woman, cries as she carries her injured son who was shot in his hand by the Syrian border guard when they were crossing a river from Syria to Lebanon . Violence: Flames and smoke raise from burning cars after two bombs exploded, at Qazaz neighborhood in Damascus, Syria, as the country descends into civil war . On March 2, her aide Mansour Azzam, . who works in the Ministry of Presidential Affairs (MOPA), sent an email . to Mrs Assad with a quote for all of the furniture she had ordered. Among more than 130 items, whose prices are given in US dollars, are 11 ottomans costing over £20,000 in total. For the dining room, Mrs Assad ordered a round table worth almost £10,000 and, for the majlis, she purchased a red-and-green Mamlouk rug for just under £11,000. Mrs Assad, who grew up in Acton, West London, also bought a ‘hanging rod with nine silk lanterns’ worth £3,000 for the basement hall. The emails show that the First Lady, who married Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2000, was kept up to date on how the furniture was being laid out in the palace, with her aides taking photographs and emailing them to her. Last September, as international condemnation of the Syrian regime grew and sanctions were imposed against the country by the US and the EU, Mrs Assad was still preoccupied with her furnishings. Asma Assad spent £270,000 on furniture from the exclusive West London shop, including items similar this ottoman . Concern: Aides kept Mrs Assad up-to-date on the whereabouts of her furniture order, leaked emails show . In an email sent to Mr Azzam on September 23, she writes: ‘I forgot to mention, the sofa below should have the same number of back cushions as bases. ‘At the moment, there are three base cushions on the main sofa (without the extension) and five on the back. ‘It should be three base and three back. If not clear, let me know.’ The First Lady uses an email account belonging to her husband’s department, MOPA. In the emails, she is sometimes referred to as ‘Mrs Assad’ but mostly as ‘Your Excellency’. Revelations: Emails show that the First Lady, left, who married Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, right, in 2000, was kept up to date on how the furniture was being laid out in the palace . She also signs off some emails as ‘aaa’, which  is thought to stand for Asma al-Assad. An earlier release of emails from Mrs Assad, in March, revealed that she was looking for a Harry Potter DVD on the internet while her country was in turmoil. Though a Muslim, she went to a Church of England school, where she was known as Emma. After studying computer science and French literature at King’s  College London, she worked as a banker at JP Morgan in the Nineties when she met her future husband. At the time, Assad was training at a hospital in London to become an eye surgeon. Last week, we revealed how British peer Lord Kenilworth was paid more than £170,000 to redesign the gardens of the summer palace.","Asma al-Assad, 36, placed the order with exclusive London store DN Designs in the King's Road, Chelsea, West London .

A schoolgirl was sent home just hours after starting the new term after teachers insisted her trousers were too tight. Fourteen-year-old  Annalise Wilks had just rejoined friends after their summer holidays and taken her first steps into preparing for GCSE exams. But the Year 10 student was pulled to one side by furious staff at Beaumont Leys School, Leicester, and told to change her trousers or go home. Some 25 children were given their marching orders or put into isolation for breaking the secondary school’s ‘zero tolerance’ uniform rules. Annalise’s mother, Denise, 44, was contacted by the school on Thursday to be told her daughter was not allowed into her classes. She  said: 'I personally think Annalise’s trousers were suitable - I don’t think they were too tight at all. I think it’s disgusting. She’s being deprived of an education. 'I know at least two other parents who are furious about it. Can’t they just educate the children until 3pm and then send them home with a letter?' Head teacher Liz Logie, who has overseen seven years of academic improvement at the school, said the hard line was important for school discipline, and that no children were sent home unless their parents were there waiting for them. Fourteen year-old Annalise Wilks (left) was sent home from school after teachers said her trousers were too tight . 'We’ve changed our school uniform and we anticipated having hiccups, which is why we posted letters to students’ homes with precise descriptions and had two or three assemblies with the pupils,' said Ms Logie. 'We made it really clear they would be put in isolation or sent home if they did not wear the uniform. 'About 20 to 25 out of 1,050 pupils were in the wrong clothes or shoes and, if their parents could be contacted, they were sent home and, if not, they were put in isolation.” Ms Logie added:  'Schools such as Beaumont Leys in challenging areas don’t get to be successful without being clear and rigorous.' Beaumont Leys School in Leicester said the hard line was necessary for school discipline. 25 other pupils were sent home on the first day of term yesterday . 'We know there were parents who were hacked off with us over the uniform but we don’t imagine they will be so hacked off when their children get good results.' In the past, pupils in years seven, eight and nine had their own uniform, while older students were asked to wear black and white, with certain restrictions on styles. The new uniform is designed for students of all year groups. Boys must wear a white shirt, school tie, black trousers and a black blazer, while girls have the same uniform with the option of wearing a knee-length skirt instead of trousers. Ms Logie said part of the reason for the new uniform was to avoid having ‘ridiculous’ conversations about what the rules were. The school’s website includes a guide with illustrations of what styles of clothes are acceptable.","Annalise Wilks was sent home on the first day of term for breaking school's uniform rules .

Two young mums punched, spat at and pulled the hair of another mother in a fight over a ‘fat’ jibe outside their children's school. Their victim, Kelly Giles, 35, was waiting to pick up her child from Merton Abbey Primary School in south London when she was confronted by Keyleigh Gore who claimed Miss Giles had called her ‘fat’ and insulted her daughter. Gore, 25, shoved Miss Giles who fell back on to a low level wall, and then started punching her repeatedly. Keyleigh Gore (left) and Sasha Fisher (right) arrive at court where they told to carry out community service . Sasha Fisher, 21, first tried to break up the pair but ended up also assaulting Miss Giles by pushing her in the shoulder and hitting her in the face. Gore and Fisher were found guilty of assault by beating after their claims of 'self-defence' were rejected by Wimbledon Magistrates' Court following the spat outside the school on March 12 this year. Both women were made subject to a one year community order with six months supervision, and also ordered to complete 40 hours of unpaid work when they appeared at Lavender Hill Magistrates’ Court for sentencing. Gore, wearing a tight flowery dress, was also told to pay £150 court costs and £150 compensation, while Fisher, sporting large silver hoop earrings, was ordered to cough up £150 costs and £50 compensation. Merton Abbey Primary School where Fisher and Gore attacked Miss Giles in March this year while the women waited for their children to come out of school . Claudius Taylor-Sonke, prosecuting, said: 'Ms Fisher and Ms Gore were walking along the road in the victim’s direction. 'Ms Gore pushed her and said ""what are you looking at? You have nothing to say now"". 'She pushed her over a low wall before starting to punch her. 'Ms Fisher approached and tried to get Ms Gore off her, but she continued to punch her. Ms Fisher then became involved and hit her. The two then walked away laughing.' Following the attack, Ms Giles entered the school and reported the incident to the headteacher, before visiting her GP. Keyleigh Gore, 25, was found guilty of assault after shoving another mother who she believed had called her fat . The court was told how the victim was left with extensive bruising to her lower back, arms and above her left eye as a result of the spat. Gore, of Wimbledon, south London, admitted she had pushed Miss Giles to ‘get her off her’ after she claimed they became embroiled in a hair-pulling tussle. Fisher, who lives in the same area, said she had broken up the two women and that she later hit Miss Giles in the face with her palm only because she had feared for her safety. Both women have 'expressed remorse' over the attack and are sorry it took place outside the school, the court heard. Hayley Brickell, in mitigation, said: 'Ms Gore is of a previous good character. Sasha Fisher claimed she initially tried to break up the fight but later hit Miss Giles in the face in 'self defence' 'She has expressed remorse and accepts causing significant harm. 'She expresses she is sorry and admits it never should’ve occurred in front of a school and wouldn’t have wanted her child to see it. 'She has undertaken charity work in the past and is due to take a diploma in graphic and web design. 'Ms Fisher has a previous conviction from when she was a juvenile at 14 years of age. 'She felt bad for the victim, particularly when she saw photos of her. 'She accepts it wasn’t right that she hit her and feels shame and embarrassment that it took place at the school her daughter attends. Keyleigh Gore and Sasha Fisher were sentenced at Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court in south London . 'She hasn’t had the best start in life with an unpleasant childhood. The factors she dealt with when growing up puts a different stance on how mature she is. 'It is not easy to be raised by a parent with alcohol dependency and have siblings with special needs. 'They are both mothers of young children who would be greatly affected by immediate imprisonment.' Magistrates accepted the assault was a less severe offence which meant the women avoided a custodial sentence.","Kelly Giles, 35, was waiting to pick up her child from Merton Abbey Primary School in south London .

Rosie, a 15-week-old fox cub, was left abandoned when her father killed most of her litter before the cubs had opened their eyes for the first time. Now she has formed a firm friendship with terrier Maddy, a Lakeland Patterdale cross, at the home of her owner Richard Bowler in Wales, despite the two creatures being natural enemies. Rosie the fox cub and Maddy the terrier have become firm friends, even snoozing together at the North Wales home of Maddy's owner Richard Bowler . The pair do not usually share a bed because of their difference in size but Maddy's owner Richard Bowler hopes that could change when Rosie gets bigger . The pair have the run of Mr Bowler's five-acre estate in Corwen, North Wales, including this venture in to the vegetable patch . The four-legged friends have plenty of energy and like to chase each other around vegetable patch . The friends have separate feeding times so they don't fight but are trained together with treats . The pair indulge in rough and tumble while Mr Bowler, 44, and his girlfriend Helen, 41, try to teach Rosie a few tricks so she can settle in at their home in the Berwyn mountains near Corwen, North Wales. Mr Bowler said: 'Nothing is known about what happened to . Rosie's mum. All we know is that her dad went rogue and she was the only . survivor and was hand-reared before her eyes had even opened. 'Rosie was slowly introduced to Maddy. Maddy has always been playful and it's a natural instinct for a fox cub . to play so they get on great. 'They have become best of friends, although we always supervise them playing together as Rosie is still quite small. Maddy and Rosie are reminiscent of Disney classic The Fox and The Hound, where Tod the fox and Copper the hunting dog become firm friends despite being natural enemies . Mr Bowler and his girlfriend Helen are training Rosie with a little help from their terrier Maddy . Rosie, posing in front of a portrait of a fox, has made herself at home at the Bowler residence . Although she rests and dozes around the house, Rosie sleeps in a crate at night to stop her chewing through the television's wires . 'They chase each other around and Rosie often dives on Maddy. The living room is usually a wreck after they have been playing.' Mr . Bowler, a wildlife photographer, and his girlfriend moved to the area . last year from Bedfordshire to run a holiday home in Blaenau Ffestiniog. Now they've acquired a new friend in . Rosie while Maddy pitches in to help show the fox cub what to do. Most . importantly, the cub has already learned to sit nicely to earn a treat. Maddy's owner Richard Bowler, with his pet terrier at his feet and Rosie in his arms, is trying to house train the cub . The pair create 'destruction' while they play together, according to Maddy's owner Mr Bowler . Despite the differences in their size, the pair indulge in good-natured play tussles around the house and grounds . Rosie's slight build helps her get the better of Maddy in the battle for the tennis ball as she looks to run away . 'I feel it's important that Rosie has . a good bond with Maddy as when it comes to training Maddy shows Rosie . what is required,' Mr Bowler said. 'Rosie is very quick to pick things up though. 'I've . been amazed at how clever she is, certainly quicker to pick up things . than Maddy ever was. Her recall and sitting is 100 per cent and we're . almost there with toilet training. Rosie is only 15 weeks old but has already lost all of her siblings when their father attacked and killed them. It is not known what happened to her mother . Rosie is quicker at picking up her training than Maddy the terrier was, Mr Bowler said . Rosie moves in on a plant as she explores her new home in the Berwyn mountains . Mr Bowler's five-acre estate near Corwen, North Wales, has plenty of space for Rosie to roam . 'They don't sleep together, we have a . large dog crate in the living room for Rosie that has her bed in it. We . only put her in her crate at night and that's just to stop her chewing . through the wires of the TV. 'When she's awake the door to the crate is open allowing her access to the living room, she also has access to our fenced in patio/veg garden while we train her. The cub is being gradually introduced to different parts of the property, starting with a fenced in patio and vegetable garden . The fox cub has almost mastered her toilet training and quickly learned to sit nicely to earn a titbit . The pair have the run of their owners' home in the Berwyn mountains near Corwen, North Wales . Maddy is helping Mr Bowler and his girlfriend Helen to train Rosie as well as being her playmate . 'We will then start introducing her to our bottom paddock that we have fenced in with two inch chicken wire, this area is about an acre and we are developing it as an orchard and wildflower meadow so she will have a lovely area to run around in and play with Maddy. 'When Rosie gets bigger we hope that her and Maddy will sleep together at the moment though as soon as they are together it's just fun and games and destruction.' Foxes and dogs may be natural enemies but nobody told Rosie and Maddy, who have formed a strong bond . Once she's had a bit more training, Rosie will be allowed to explore the orchard and meadow . She was abandoned shortly after her birth but Rosie is thriving in Maddy's company .","Rosie, a 15-week old cub, was abandoned when father killed her siblings .

The toddler is recovering from an extremely rare form of leukaemia called Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (JMML), which affects just one-in-a-million children worldwide. Since having a bone marrow transplant, Leighton has been left with no immune system, which doctors believe could have caused his photosensitivity.

He is pictured just after his bone marrow transplant at 14 months in August 2012 . His mother Zoe, 22, said: 'He is not allowed outside at all. He can only travel early in the morning or a night time but only in a car with tinted windows and air con. 'I have to keep the curtains at home closed and the blinds shut...and cover him up as much as possible because it is so hot. 'I cover him in factor 50 plus sun cream even when he is indoors - he is living in darkness.' The recent sunny weather has caused the toddler's skin to severely crack and split, leaving him with agonising blisters . His mother applies sun cream to Leighton six times daily and baths him twice a day to prevent his skin from flaring up. But the toddler's symptoms have persisted and he regularly has painful, itchy rashes and sores all over his body. 'His skin will change colour from white to red. He is constantly scratching or picking his skin,' his mother said. Leighton is shown here after his transplant in October 2012, when he was then diagnosed with chronic graft versus host disease. The symptoms have persisted and he suffers from painful rashes and sores where his skin turns red . 'It is painful for him and he gets very agitated. He looks out the window and wants to play outside. He gets upset when he sees other people outside and he is locked up indoors. 'How do you explain to a two-year-old they can’t go outside - it is heartbreaking. I get really upset. She said: 'I can’t take him out to keep him entertained. It is really hard. I have to rely on other people to get me a loaf of bread and things like that as I need to keep him indoors 24/7. The only time I leave him is when I go to work.' His mother said the skin condition (pictured right) is painful for the toddler, who gets very . agitated.  Leighton is pictured (left) when he was readmitted to hospital for chronic graft versus host disease, which opened him up to infections . Leighton is undergoing daily tests at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where he is currently receiving treatment for his leukaemia. He also has to go to Rotherham General Hospital every two weeks for two days for specialist treatment using ultraviolet light, called Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP), which could make make his Photosensitivty even worse and leave him needing special sunglasses. Leighton was diagnosed with JMML in February last year and after waiting six months underwent a bone marrow transplant in July 2012.

A former maths graduate has invented a chocolate bar with so few calories it could help you lose weight. Entrepreneurial chocoholic Aneesh Popat has created what he calls ‘water ganache’ which allows him to make chocolate bars with as little as 20 calories. The water ganache is made without butter, cream, gelatine or eggs to create a ‘pure’ chocolate that won’t stay on your hips. No shock choc: Aneesh Popat, known as The Chocolatier has created a chocolate which will only set you back 20 calories per bar . By combining flavour-infused water with high-quality cocoa Aneehsh’s water ganache comes in a range of flavours, from the more exotic chai tea and pineapple and cardamom to classic salted caramel and mint truffles. After launching his own sweet-making business The Chocolatier two years ago, the 25 year old Londoner has been taking the confectionary world by storm. Aneesh is now aiming to introduce his creations to some of the finest restaurants before opening his first shop in London's St Pancras station. Aneesh said: ‘Ever since I was a youngster being around chocolate has always been my passion. If everything in the world was made of chocolate then I'd have eaten it by now. ‘My love of chocolate led me to devote . and apply my mathematical and scientific backgrounds to create the most . unique flavour combinations with utmost precision and creativity.' Light invention: Aneesh displays his water ganache at Taste of London on Friday - a type of chocolate which is made without butter, cream or eggs . Tasty treat: The water ganache chocolate is made with infused water making it possible for Aneesh to create flavours such as mint strawberry, pineapple cardamom and salted caramel . Aneesh is self-taught but says he has taken inspiration from many famous chocolatiers and chefs and has travelled 'from Brugges to Mumbai' in his search for the perfect flavours. ‘Chocolate is good for you if made in the right way. I believe in using quality ingredients, and I place great importance on creating chocolate that is exciting, experimental and thought provoking, all too en-heighten taste and indulgence.’ Nutritional expert Dr Sarah Schenker believes that overweight people may find help in the low-calorie chocolates - so long as the balance is right. Dr Schenker, of the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘As these chocolates boast such a low calorie level and high water content it can be advantageous to people seeking a less naughty treat - rather than sausage rolls or typical chocolates. ‘They can be encouraging for people to switch to as snacks but it has to be done with caution - after all we mustn't forget that chocolate is an occasional treat to enjoy.' Success: Aneesh launched The Chocolatier two years ago and has been hailed by chefs around the world since and now supplies Michelin star restaurants . She added: 'Certainly the benefits could indeed help people to lose weight as they would find it easier to stay away from naughty snacks.’ Aneesh is now pushing to introduce his chocolate to the open market - finding great success at national food exhibitions. The confectionaries are already being supplied to Michelin star restaurants and five star hotels in London and Aneesh is also hoping to launch his first shop this autumn. Aneesh said: ‘The response from people has been astonishing. After taking the initial recipe and creating the first batch I knew it could potentially transform my life. ‘I would never have thought I'd be where I am today - and that's still not very far. The next process is to open a shop and begin working relationships with restaurants. ‘It's an incredible feeling to know people enjoy what you've made - many people struggle with their weight but I guess I'm here to save the day and their figures.’","New 'water ganache' chocolate contains only 20 calories per bar .

A dad who told staff at Manchester Airport his pregnant wife had cancer to claim a free family holiday worth £7,000 has been jailed. John Williams, 35, who admitted attempted fraud when his web of lies was exposed, was jailed at Liverpool crown court for two years. Williams’ deceit began when he phoned the airport’s customer contact centre to make a complaint. Why does everyone want to go to Florida: The jobless dad-of-two claimed he was a doctor and that his wife had pancreatic cancer. He said she had contacted Airline Direct Travel to book a family holiday to Florida and overheard the call taker say 'Why does everyone with cancer want to go to Florida?' The jobless dad-of-two claimed he was a doctor and that his wife had pancreatic cancer. He said she had contacted Airline Direct Travel (ADT) – the airport’s online travel agent – to book a family holiday to Florida. He said she was put on hold and overheard the call taker say ‘Why does everyone with cancer want to go to Florida?’ His wife, he said, collapsed. And he also told them that his neighbour was so outraged he contacted the press. On July 26 last year, Manchester Airport was made aware of the complaint and offered Williams a free holiday, on the basis his story was true. ADT organised free flights to Orlando and accommodation worth £7,000. But when the travel agent investigated further, Williams’ lies unravelled. Manchester Airport: John Williams was offered a trip to Florida by the airport if his story was true - it was proven not to be . A full audit of their telephone records found no trace of the alleged conversation. This led to their cancellation of the holiday, costing the Manchester Airports Group, part-owned by Manchester taxpayers, £3,500. But Williams, from St Helens, persisted, calling a member of airport staff to threaten them with complaints to holiday watchdog ABTA and the press. He said he wanted his holiday or for the airport to cancel its contract with ADT – but was told neither of these things would happen. When brazen Williams turned up at the airport on August 17 last year with his wife and two children, he was arrested. Pc Simon Booth from the airport said: 'Williams deceived both his family and staff at Manchester Airport. 'He told his wife he was employed, but in fact he had no job and said he wanted to provide a holiday for his family, but could not do this without being dishonest. 'Williams may have had financial difficulties, but it is unspeakable to falsely claim his wife had cancer in order to get a free holiday.'","His wife, he said, collapsed.

A hand-held gadget that costs less than an iPhone is offering new freedom to millions of Britons on ‘blood-thinning’ medicine. The drugs, the most common of which is warfarin, are given to those with a variety of heart and circulatory problems. But they require constant monitoring to help limit severe side effects, such as heavy bruising and internal bleeding, and often patients must visit their doctor on a weekly basis. Home help: The CoaguChek XS allows deep vein thrombosis patients to test their blood levels instead of visiting a clinic . The £300 CoaguChek XS allows patients to test warfarin levels in their blood at home, which means clinic check-ups can be carried out only when there’s a cause for concern. Research has shown the device could save the NHS an estimated £62 million a year in blood test costs and GP time. Warfarin, which is taken by  1.2 million people in the UK, is used to reduce the risk of blood clots in those suffering conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Although many people think it thins the blood, it actually inhibits the production of vitamin K in the liver, which affects the time it takes blood to clot. New way: Blood test in clinics are costly and time consuming . The speed at which clotting takes place is monitored via a test called International Normalised Ratio (INR). ‘If your INR is below the optimal range you risk suffering a blood clot. If it’s over it means you may have a bleed,’ says Eve Knight, of AntiCoagulation Europe, a charity that helps thrombosis sufferers. Currently, only two per cent of patients test themselves. It takes a minute to ascertain the correct INR using a CoaguCheck XS. Patients apply a drop of blood to a test strip and call their nurse with the result. The nurse can then advise if the warfarin dose needs to be adjusted. ‘Doing it this way means that you can pick up on fluctuations quickly,’ says Ms Knight. l acsma.org.ukpidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.","New device will help DVT patients .

Curators say his work foreshadows modern techniques like MRI scans and 3D computer modelling 'to an astonishing degree'. Da Vinci began researching the human body to ensure his paintings were as true to nature as possible. Between 1507 and 1513 he dissected more than 30 human corpses, including that of a 100-year-old man.

Breaking down the body: Animation of the vertebral column, pictured left, and da Vinci's drawing of one, right . Leonardo da Vinci is best known for his stunning artwork but the Italian Renaissance painter had many talents. He was also a sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. The Mona Lisa is his most famous and most parodied portrait while his painting of The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon - being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Only around fifteen of his paintings survive because of his constant, and frequently disastrous, experimentation with new techniques, and his chronic procrastination. Leonardo is also revered for his technological ingenuity. He conceptualised a helicopter, a tank, concentrated solar power, a calculator, and the double hull, also outlining a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, but some of his smaller inventions, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. He made important discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, optics, and hydrodynamics, but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science.","Da Vinci began researching the human body to ensure his artworks were as accurate as possible .

"Police officer stabbed in the hand with scissors amid scuffles in Manhattan . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:11 EST, 1 January 2012 . The Occupy Wall Street movement made a surprise invasion of Zuccotti Park last night while the police focused on New Year's Eve celebrations elsewhere in New York. Around 800 demonstators piled up metal barricades, hoisting American flags and banners while scuffles broke out between activists and police. Shortly before midnight, 100 NYPD officers had surrounded the park in downtown Manhattan with reports of pepper spray being used. Relentless: Occupy Wall Street protesters and New York Police clash over barricades at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan on New Year's Eve . One individual was arrested after an officer was stabbed in the hand with scissors. The policeman was taken to Bellevue Hospital and believed to be in a stable condition. Zuccotti Park hasn't been occupied since police cleared it on November 15 in an early morning raid.  The movement escalated at 8pm last night, when around 100 protesters entered the park and erected a small tent. The New York Times reported: 'By about 10.30 pm, there were more than 300 people inside... One man carried a big white placard that read - New Years Revolution.' Reinforced: The Occupy Wall Street movement returned to Zuccotti Park with renewed energy last night while the police were focused on keeping the rest of the city safe . Shortly before midnight, OWS protesters announced on Twitter that they had reclaimed the park and unfurled a huge hand-painted banner reading 'OCCUPY WALL STREET'. They tweeted: 'Barricades being torn down at liberty [Zuccotti] park...Happy new years!!' As the new year was welcomed around the city, demonstrators chanted: 'Whose year? Our year.' On Occupy Wall Street's official website it stated: '2011 was an amazing awakening. Let's start 2012 off right! Come . celebrate with thousands of other members of the 99%, at our park and in . the streets, as we make our special New Years Revolution together.' Police in riot gear entered the park at 1.30am  where 150 people remained and arrested five demonstrators. Authorities closed the park until 9am this morning. Celebration: Protesters returned to the park en masse shortly before midnight in downtown Manhattan . Activists had been camped out in Zuccotti Park since September 17 to protest against the unjust distribution of wealth in the U.S. and . the excessive influence of big business on government. The movement spread to other U.S. cities including Los Angeles and Portland as well as Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Ireland . and Portugal. Mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered the protest to be cleared in November because health and safety conditions had become 'intolerable' in the crowded plaza. One million revellers filled Times Square to welcome in the new year last night amid tight security. More than 1,500 members of the NYPD were patrolling the massive 17-block party to ensure everyone’s safety. They also used more than 3,000 cameras and numerous check-points with bag inspections. Alcohol was banned from the event.",Police officer stabbed in the hand with scissors amid scuffles in Manhattan .
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 06:32 EST, 13 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:03 EST, 14 November 2012 . The crippling rise in university tuition fees has fuelled the biggest increase in the cost of living for more than a year, official figures revealed yesterday. Inflation jumped to 2.7 per cent in October, up from 2.2 per cent in September. This means it has been above the Government target of two per cent since November 2009, when it stood at 1.9 per cent. The Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation rose to 2.7 per cent - a bigger-than-expected increase after falling steadily since June . The rise of nearly 20 per cent in . education costs helped push up the figure, said the Office for National . Statistics. It is the largest monthly increase in this category since . its records began in 1996. Tuition fees rose to up to £9,000 a year from September. Andrew Goodwin, of accountants’ Ernst . & Young’s ITEM Club, said the sharp rise in the Consumer Price . Index was ‘a very nasty surprise’ at a time when Britons are still . suffering a squeeze on their incomes. The ONS figures also showed that the price of essentials was still rising. Between September and October, . clothes and shoes cost 1.2 per cent more and food jumped 0.5 per cent, . with the rise blamed mainly on meat, fish, fruit and sugar. The cost of living has risen sharply, fuelled by increases in food prices and the trebling of tuition fees. The Treasury said the figures were . ‘disappointing’ as experts predicted the Consumer Prices Index would . break through three per cent by the New Year. Inflation had been steadily falling in recent months after peaking at 5.2 per cent in September 2011. But the rate of rises in prices . continues to outstrip pay increases for those in work, leaving millions . of families worse off every month in real terms. The ONS said education costs jumped by 19.1 per cent last month - the largest increase since records began. It follows the government’s decision to increase tuition fees from £3,375 to up to £9,000. The decision to increase tuition fees to £9,000, which triggered angry protests and clashes between students and police, has fuelled a sharp rise in inflation . Terrible . weather this summer has blighted crops, in particular potatoes and . carrot harvests. As a result food prices have risen sharply. Since . last month’s most of the big energy firms have announced major . increases in prices which are likely to bump up inflation in the coming . weeks and months. Some experts think CPI could reach 3.5 per cent by the middle of next year. James Knightley, an economist at ING Bank, said he expected inflation to rise to 3 per cent by January.Economist Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, said the inflation data provides an ‘uncomfortable backdrop’ to the Bank of England’s inflation report tomorrow. ‘Nonetheless, we still think that the weakness of economic activity will bring inflation down further in time,’ he added. This week the government managed to quell a rebellion from Tory backbenchers over a planned 3p rise in fuel duty with a promise that more help for hard-pressed families will be announced in next month's autumn budget. Catherine McKinnell, Labour’s shadow treasury minister, said: ‘This is a worrying increase in the inflation rate. But instead of easing the squeeze, the Government is adding to the cost of living crisis for people on low and middle incomes.’","Consumer Prices Index rises by bigger-than-expected 2.7 per cent .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 02:59 EST, 8 February 2012 . Theresa May has said she wants to be able to . 'deport Abu Qatada so he's not in this country when the Olympics come'. She told the House of Commons the Government would do 'everything . we can within the existing legal regime to deport Qatada and we're doing . everything we can to reform that regime to avoid these cases in . future.' As things stand, the notorious hate preacher will . be free to walk the streets and take his child to school within a week, . after a court ruled he must be bailed. Scroll down for video . Swipe: Theresa May telling the Commons 'the right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell' after a judge ruled radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada should be bailed . Ministers are attempting to deport . him to Jordan to stand trial on terror charges, but three weeks ago they . were blocked by European human rights judges. Mrs May blasted the judge's decision . to free Osama Bin Laden's 'ambassador in Europe' and said 'the right . place for the foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell'. She said it was simply not acceptable that Britain cannot . deport a radical Muslim cleric who 'poses a serious risk to our national . security'. She also pointed out that as Qatada does not have immigration status he is not entitled to claim benefits. 'The right place for a terrorist is a . prison cell; the right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign . prison cell far away from Britain,' she said. Mrs May said British courts had found . Qatada 'poses a serious risk to our national security', has a . 'long-standing association with Al Qaeda' and provides 'religious . justification for acts of violence and terror'. The radical Muslim cleric is expected to walk free from Long Lartin high security prison in Worcestershire on Monday. Preacher of hate Abu Qatada (left) can be released on bail after more than six years in prison, Mr Justice Mitting (right) ruled . The Home Secretary said that the preacher will be arrested if he breaks any of his stringent bail conditions. He has been given a 22-hour curfew, . must wear an electronic tag and has been told there are strict . conditions over who he can meet. But yesterday Mr Justice Mitting ruled that he must be allowed to walk his youngest child to school under his bail conditions. 'If any of these conditions are breached, he will be re-arrested and we will seek his immediate re-detention,' she added. Tory backbenchers jeered, and one . shouted 'disgrace', as Mrs May explained the Government's opposition to . last month's ruling and the subsequent decision to grant Qatada bail. She said: 'But however strict the bail conditions, I continue to believe that Qatada should remain behind bars. 'It simply isn't acceptable that, . after guarantees from the Jordanians about his treatment, after British . courts have found he is dangerous, after his removal has been approved . by the highest courts in our land, we still cannot deport dangerous . foreign nationals.' Jordanian authorities released this picture of . Qatada (left) in 2008 under his name of Omar abu Omar. Right, the Daily . Mail's front page from January 27, 2005 . Qatada is currently being held at the Category A Long Lartin prison, but after a judge's ruling will walk free within days . Qatada has been held for . six-and-a-half years, more than any other detainee in modern immigration . history, while fighting deportation to Jordan. But he will be released from the . maximum security prison where he is being held after applying for bail . when human rights judges in Europe ruled he could not be deported . without assurances from Jordan that evidence gained through torture . would not be used against him. He has cost taxpayers more than £1million in benefits, prison costs and legal fees. Mrs May said the Government was . continuing to consider the case for a British Bill of Rights and the . Prime Minister was leading the case for reform of the Strasbourg-based . human rights court. Officials do not consider it likely . that Qatada will take part in the planning of a terrorist attack or . other operational activities. However, it is feared he could use the internet to give justification for attacks overseas or in Britain. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has overruled every court in Britain in ruling that Abu Qatada can stay in Britain . Officials want to prevent this . happening by banning him from having a mobile phone or access to the . internet, where his sermons could be uploaded on to extremist websites. In his ruling, Mr Justice Mitting . said Qatada’s bail conditions could be relaxed within three months . unless Britain makes ‘demonstrable progress’ in negotiations to send the . 52-year-old home. Last month, judges in Strasbourg . ruled that Qatada could not be deported in case evidence obtained from . torture was used against him at trial in Jordan. British diplomats are . trying to extract assurances that this will not happen. Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the Government was bound by the rule of law 'as much as anybody else'. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today . programme: 'The Government is obviously very concerned about this case . and very much wishes to see Abu Qatada deported to Jordan and, when he . is in Jordan, tried fairly if the Jordanian authorities wish to put him . on trial. 'He cannot be deported unless the . assurances which are required following the judgement in the European . Court of Human Rights can be secured.' Abu Qatada has variously been described as 'Al Qaeda's spiritual leader in Europe', 'Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe', 'the most significant extremist preacher in the UK' and 'a truly dangerous individual'. The Jordanian father of five, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, claimed asylum when he arrived in Britain in September 1993 on a forged passport. He was allowed to stay and preach his extremism, and was accused of calling on British Muslims to martyr themselves in a holy war on 'oppression'. A 1995 'fatwa' he issued justified the killing of converts from Islam, their wives and children in Algeria. In October 1999 a sermon in London called for the killing of Jews and praised attacks on Americans. And the same year he was convicted in his absence of planning terror attacks in Jordan. When he was arrested in February 2001 he was found in possession of £170,000 in cash, including £805 in an envelope marked 'For the mujahedin in Chechnya'. Videos of his sermons were found in the Hamburg flat used by some of the 9/11 hijackers. As fears of a domestic terror threat grew after those attacks, he thwarted every attempt by the Government to detain and deport him; he went on the run to avoid being detained without trial or charged under new anti-terror laws. After 10 months on the run he was discovered in a council house in south London, arrested and taken to Belmarsh high-security prison. Qatada was released in March 2005 and put under a 22-hour home curfew designed to limit contact with other extremists. He was rearrested months later but ministers were thwarted in their efforts to deport him because of fears he would be tortured if he returned to Jordan. As the court battle continued, Qatada was released in June 2008 to live in his £800,000 council house in west London before being rearrested that November over fears he would breach his bail conditions. In 2008, the Court of Appeal ruled in Qatada's favour, saying there were reasonable grounds for believing he would be denied a fair trial in Jordan because evidence against him could have been extracted through torture. But in a landmark judgement in February 2009, five Law Lords unanimously backed the Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the basis of assurances from foreign governments. Lord Phillips, now president of the Supreme Court, went further, saying that evidence of torture in another country 'does not require the UK to retain in this country, to the detriment of national security, a terrorist suspect'. Qatada has always denied claims that he is al Qaeda's European ambassador, and insists he never met Osama bin Laden.","Home secretary says 'a foreign terrorist should be in a foreign jail'

George Osborne faced a bruising setback last night as Britain suffered a second downgrade to its once-coveted top credit rating. International agency Fitch stripped the United Kingdom of its gold-plated AAA status just  as the country teeters on the brink of an unprecedented triple-dip recession. Rival agency Moody’s has already downgraded the Government’s credit score. It leaves Standard & Poor’s as the only major ratings agency to rate the UK as an AAA country. Worrying: Britain's credit rating has been downgraded this evening by a leading international ratings agency. The Bank of England is pictured . Fitch blamed ‘a weaker economic and fiscal outlook’ for Britain for its decision, rounding off a dismal week for the Chancellor. The International Monetary Fund warned he was ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with austerity before the recovery gets going while incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney branded the UK a ‘crisis economy’. But a defiant Mr Osborne made it clear he is ready to defend his plans aggressively when IMF inspectors arrive in London next month for the annual health check of the UK economy. It is thought the Washington-based Fund is preparing to call for a relaxation of the austerity plans – a recommendation the Chancellor is  prepared to defy. Mr Osborne said he was not ‘about to restart the consumption boom’ that took place under Labour. Attack: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, left, said the downgrade was a 'humiliating blow' to Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, right . France . - Was stripped of its AAA rating in November 2012, despite President . Hollande's pledge of reforms. Moved to the Aa1 rating, Moody's . highlighted the 'structural challenges' as the main reason for the . downgrade, such as high unemployment and lack of competitiveness. Spain . - Standard & Poor cut Spain's credit rating by two notches to BBB- . in February 2012 after citing the economic conditions severely limited . the government's options. Italy . - Moody's downgraded Italy's rating from A3 to Baa2 on concern that . deteriorating financial conditions in Europe will lead to a sharp rise . in borrowing costs. Portugal . - Their credit rating was downgraded to the same level as Spain in . 2012, BBB-, which is below the investment level, one level above junk . status. USA . - Their rating was downgraded to AA+ from AAA for the first time, which . was seen as a symbolic blow to one of the great powers. Fears over how . the national debt could be lowered was seen as a key factor. Greece . - The struggling country has actually seen its status raised - however . it was rock bottom at 'selective default' and is now at B- in light of . its determination to cut spending, as well as the willingness of other . eurozone countries to help out. Slovakia, Slovenia and Malta have also seen their ratings downgraded in the last two years. He said the main problems in the global . economy were in the eurozone and that Britain has taken decisive action . to start a recovery. In particular the Government was acting to restart the housing market through its Help to Buy scheme, while its Funding for Lending Scheme would lower the cost of borrowing to homeowners and small and medium-sized firms. And he revealed that Britain is taking legal action at the European Court of Justice to  fight the effort by 11 European countries, including Germany and France, to impose a financial transactions tax on the banks. Britain fears  that this could jeopardise the success of the City of London. Official figures next week will reveal whether Britain has suffered a triple-dip recession over the winter. The economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year and another slump in the first three months of 2013 would officially herald a third recession since 2008. Mr Osborne – who admitted that at times he was ‘almost overwhelmed’ by emotion at Lady Thatcher’s funeral – said criticism of his policies had been embraced by those ‘who are opposed to dealing with Britain’s deficit and debt’. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the Fitch downgrade showed that Tories were ‘failing their own test’, having made preserving Britain’s credit rating a key test of their economic policy before the election in 2010. But Labour was in chaos last night over claims it plans to fight the next election on a pledge to rack up yet more debts to boost public spending. Mr Balls refused to rule out rejecting Coalition budget limits from 2015 onwards. He is among senior Labour figures said to believe there is a growing consensus in favour of more debt-funded investment in public works and housebuilding. But the dwindling band of Blairite MPs are said to be horrified by the idea and insist that the party must commit to staying within the Tories’ spending limits.","Fitch downgraded Britain because of 'weaker economic and fiscal outlook'

Convicted: Darren Newton stole the contents of a kitchen belonging to his friends, Andrew and Michelle Milton . A financial adviser stole an entire kitchen from two friends after pretending to help them out of debt. Darren Newton, 40, persuaded Andrew Milton and his wife Michelle, both 48, to give up their £310,000, five-bedroom home when it was in danger of being repossessed. Then, while the couple were living in rented accommodation, Newton paid two tradesman – who knew nothing of the plan – to enter the house and strip the kitchen of various appliances. They took kitchen goods - including an . oven, a hob, utility room units and even the kitchen sink – knocking . around £15,000 off the value of the house. Mr Milton noticed the kitchen had been gutted when he went to visit his home, in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, for one last time. Police then arrested former RAF man Newton as he returned from a holiday in Abu Dhabi. When questioned, Newton lied to detectives and told them he had not been to the house since his friends had vacated it. But yesterday, at Lincoln Magistrates’ Court, he was found guilty of stealing the goods. During the trial, Mr Milton said he couldn’t ‘comprehend’ what he was seeing when he made the discovery. ‘It took a minute to sink in and then I realised the whole kitchen was missing,’ he said. ‘It was total disbelief. ‘It was so awkward because I couldn’t work out how or why it had happened. ‘But the only other person who had keys was Mr Newton.’ Mrs Milton said they had been shattered by the actions of a man they had considered ‘a really good friend’. She said: ‘We’re a family just trying to live our lives. You put your trust in someone and this is what happens. ‘If you can’t put your trust in someone like Darren, who can you trust?’ Before: Mr and Mrs Milton's kitchen in the £310,000 home they had lived in for five years . After: £6,500 worth of kitchenware was stolen by former RAF man Milton . Newton, from Evedon, Lincolnshire, first met the Miltons in September 2011 to give them mortgage repayment advice after their house had failed to sell. He told the court he then asked if he could have the Miltons’ kitchen, to which he claimed the pair told him ‘take whatever you want’. The businessman, who runs mortgageforce in Sleaford, also suggested the pair took anything of value out of the house. However, the Miltons told the court this was untrue and explained they could not bring themselves to gut the kitchen. When the tradesmen entered the property to take the goods, they used keys given to Newton by Mrs Milton on the understanding they would be passed on to the mortgage provider. Oblivious to their part in the wrongdoing, they took out the goods and put them in the mortgage adviser’s garage so he could use them to refit his utility room. Mr Milton realised the items - worth more than £6,500 - were missing when he went to visit his home of five years for a final time in November last year. The police were called and they visited the financial adviser’s business. When questioned by police he declined to answer any questions but later admitted in court he had lied to a detective when he told her he had sent the house keys to the mortgage provider that June. Summing up, Paul Wood, prosecuting, said: ‘The Miltons came across as clear and credible. ‘In complete polar opposition to that you heard evidence from Mr Newton which lacked credibility across the board.’ The businessman, who claimed he was ‘protecting the Miltons’ because he thought they were in trouble, was arrested after he returned home from a nine-day holiday to Abu Dhabi last November. Newton will be sentenced at Lincoln Crown Court at a later date.","Darren Newton convicted after stealing £6,500-worth of kitchen goods .

The huge billboard was placed outside the art faculty of Chulalongkorn University as part of a tribute to this year's graduating class. Insult: The huge billboard was placed outside the art faculty of Chulalongkorn University (pictured) as part of a tribute to this year's graduating class . It said 'Congratulations' in bold white . letters and showed Hitler with his arm raised in a Nazi salute next to . Batman, Captain America, the Incredible Hulk and Iron Man. '(We) would like to formally express our sincere apology for our students' ""Superhero"" mural,' art school dean Suppakorn Disatapundhu said in a statement issued Monday. 'I can assure you we are taking this matter very seriously.' The billboard was up for two days before being removed Saturday in response to criticism. Online photographs showed graduating students in their robes, mimicking Hitler's raised arm salute. Shocking: In Thailand world history is glossed over, with little or no mention of the Holocaust, World War II or Hitler . Suppakorn said that freshman art . students had painted the banner as part of a traditional send-off from . incoming students to the graduating class, and it was one of dozens of . banners and billboards across the campus during the university's . commencement period. The artistic vision behind the . picture was to show that good and bad people co-exist in the world, . Suppakorn said after summoning the students for an explanation. 'They told me the concept was to paint a picture of superheroes who protect the world,"" the dean said in a telephone interview. 'Hitler was supposed to serve as a conceptual paradox to the superheroes,' he said, noting that the superheroes were painted in vivid colors, while Hitler's image was in grey scale. 'This kind of thoughtless display will not happen again.' The Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish human rights group, had criticized the banner prior to its removal. 'Hitler as a superhero? Is he an appropriate role model for Thailand's younger generation - a genocidal hate monger who mass murdered Jews and Gypsies and who considered people of color as racially inferior,' Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the center, said in a statement Friday. 'The Simon Wiesenthal Center is outraged and disgusted by this public display at Thailand's leading school of higher education.'

Rockne Newell, 59, who was feuding with Ross Township officials over living conditions at his home, is accused of firing gunshots through the wall before bursting into the municipal building. Pennsylvania state police said he was tackled to the ground and shot in the leg. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Rockne Newell is accused of killing three people dead at a Ross Township board meeting last night . Investigation: Pennsylvania State Police are searching Newell's dilapidated home and yard (pictured) Violations: Newell has a longstanding dispute with the township authorities over his home (pictured) Witnesses said the gunman went to his car to get another weapon before he was tackled. At least two people were injured in the shootout and at least one of the three men shot dead was a town official. 'I heard more than 10 shots,' Pocono Record reporter Chris Reber said, who was at the meeting. 'It was automatic, like a string of firecrackers.' State police said about 15 to 18 residents and town officials were at the building, a short drive from Newell's property, when the gunfire erupted. Two people died at the scene, and a third person died after being flown to a hospital. A woman was undergoing surgery late Monday. One person was shot . in the leg, two were shot in the stomach and one was shot in the head, . according to the Pocono Record. Investigators said Newell began shooting as he approached the building and continued as he walked into and through it. He then went back out to his vehicle in the parking lot, retrieved a handgun and went back into the building, firing more shots, police said. Disrepair: Newell's property was compared to a junkyard in local media reports about his feud with officials . Horrific: Rockne Newell is alleged to have opened fire on the Ross Township board meeting Monday night . Emergency: Police, fire and ambulance crews poured into the scene after the first 911 call just before 7:30pm . Reber said he was at the township building when a man armed with a long gun with a scope shot through a wall into the meeting. 'The thing that got my attention: . plaster flying out, blowing out through the walls. Witnesses would later . tell me they saw pictures exploding away from the walls,' Reber said in . the first-person account told to his editors Marta Gouger and Chris . Mele. He said he crawled out to a hallway, exited the building and took cover behind a vehicle. 'The gunman was this guy wearing a . blue Hawaiian shirt,' he said. 'I saw him go back out to his car, a . silver Impala, and get another gun. 'It wasn't real to me until I went back inside and saw people bleeding.' A township official tending to the wounded man was able to wrestle the gunman to the ground, actually shooting him with his own gun during the scuffle, Reber added. ‘(West End Open Space Commission . executive director) Bernie Kozen was there tending to the man and he . (the shooter) didn't see them,’ Reber continued. ‘Bernie bearhugged him . and took him down. He shot (the shooter) with his own gun.’ ‘Mr. Kozen is a true hero tonight,’ Rep. Matt Cartwright, who represents the state's 17th District Cartwright said. Three hospitals: Victims, including suspected gunman Newell, were taken to three separate hospitals, according to reports . At war: Newell has been at war with the town over the use of his property, which is reportedly being searched by Pennsylvania State Police . Newell had been in a long-running . dispute with township officials over the dilapidated condition of his . property, state police Capt. Edward Hoke said. The township supervisors voted in . February 2012 to take legal action against Newell for violating zoning . and sewer regulations, according to meeting minutes posted online. Last October, Newell set up a . fundraising page online and was trying to raise $10,000 to pay for legal . fees in his battle with the township. 'Ross township took me to court & . the court ruled I have to vacate my home of 20 years,' he wrote on the . page called saveRockyshome. 'I live on SSI which comes to $600 a month I . have no money to clean it up.' Newell said his two rescue dogs 'will be put to sleep because no one else will take them.' The property includes an old camper in . the front yard filled with wooden pallets, pieces of what appear to be . old railroad ties and trash. A garage leans and appears close to . collapse, and a propane tank sits inside an old dog house. State police, who guarded the property early Tuesday, were awaiting a search warrant so they can enter it. In June, the Pocono Record wrote a . story about what it said was an 18-year fight between the township and . Newell over his property. Trashed: Newell was fighting with the town over the condition of his property, which was once discovered by police to have buckets of human excrement . Pennsylvania State Police confirmed Newell was arrested and said three people were killed in the shooting . Monroe County Court in August 2012 sided with the township and ordered Newell to vacate and never again occupy or use the property unless he had the permits to do so. The report said Newell had been living out of a car, a 1984 Pontiac Fiero, and in abandoned buildings since being ordered to vacate. Newell told the paper he was unemployed for years after an injury from a crash and had nowhere else to go. 'They have no right to kick me off my property,' he told the newspaper. 'They call my property an eyesore. When I bought it, it was one of only three properties on the entire road that didn't have what they call junk.' Newell was in police custody after being treated at the hospital Monday night. Ross Township has about 5,500 residents . Newell told the Record this past June he couldn’t afford the septic hookup fees, and eerily complained about his perceived treatment. ‘If I lose this property, I have nowhere else to go,’ said Newell, adding 'what they're doing to me, what they've been doing to me for so long, it's wrong.’ Authorities have yet to bring charges against Newell but are holding him while his property is searched.","Two men died at the scene, a third man died at a local hospital .

A ‘brain in a bottle’ has been grown by stem cell scientists who hope it will lead to treatments for neurological and mental diseases. The ‘organoids’, three to four millimetres across, have a structure similar to that of an immature human brain. But the scientists insist that they are still far from creating an artificial brain – or even parts for damaged brains. The goal was to produce a biological tool that can be used to investigate the workings of the brain, better understand brain diseases, and test new drugs. Scientists have created pea-sized brains from a patient's skin that could lead to cures for common neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Image shows a comparison between a developing brain (left) and the organoid (right) that the team created . Professor Juergen Knoblich, of the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology in Vienna, derived the iPS cells (induced pluripotent stem cells) from the connective tissue of a patient with microcephaly. This is a rare but devastating genetic disorder in which brain size is dramatically reduced leaving the sufferer with severe mental disability. Like many neurological conditions, the disease has been difficult to study in mice because they do not share the same brain complexity as us. The new miniature brains - called cerebral organoids - helped the researchers identify a defect that affects normal brain development in microcephaly leading to a smaller brain. The cells disrupted in humans do not undergo the same expansion in mice explaining why mouse models have been unable to replicate the severity of this disorder, said the researchers. The team used a 3D matrix scaffold that mimics the environment of a human embryo and special lab devices, called spinning bio reactors, which produce nutrients and oxygen, to grow the brains. Using stem cells - master cells that can turn into almost any cell type in the body - researchers grew skin cells into 3D tissue that mimics a brain. Image shows a cross-section of an entire organoid . Professor Knoblich said: ‘We turned patient derived cells into primitive cells called iPS cells and then used those to generate the cerebral organoids and compare them to ones from healthy patients. ‘Ultimately, we would like to use them to study more common disorders like schizophrenia or autism as it has been shown the underlying defects occur during the development of the brain. ‘We are satisfied - or we hope - we will be able to model some of these defects as well.’ He said the cultures also offer hope of testing drugs in a human setting to avoid animal experiments and get more informed results which become easily transferable to cures in humans. Dr Oliver Brustle, a neuro-pathologist . and renowned expert in stem cell research at Bonn University in Germany, . reviewed the study for the journal and described it as ‘remarkable’. They displayed an organisation similar to that seen in the early stages of the developing human brain's cerebral cortex. Image shows a magnified picture of an organoid . He said: ‘The authors find when left to aggregate under appropriate conditions neural cells generated from human iPS cells self-organise into cerebral organoids - up to pea-sized miniatures of developing human brain tissue. ‘These structures are not just peculiar lab artefacts. As the authors show the organoids recreate early steps in the formation of the human brain’s cerebral cortex and so lend themselves to studies of brain development and neuro-developmental disorders.’ Dr Martin Coath, from the Cognition Institute at the University of Plymouth, questioned why anyone would ever want to create a ‘real’ human brain. ‘A human brain that was “fully working” would be conscious, have hopes, dreams, feel pain, and would ask questions about what we were doing to it,’ he said. ‘Something we have grown in the lab, but on a much simpler level than a human brain, might be hooked up to electronic eyes, ears, and hands and be taught to do something - maybe something that is as sophisticated as many simple living creatures. That doesn’t seem so far off to me.’ Neuroscientist Professor Paul Matthews, from Imperial College London, said: ‘This study offers the promise of a major new tool for understanding the causes of major developmental disorders of the brain such as autism and schizophrenia, as well as testing possible treatments. Treatments are still a long way off, but this important study illuminates part of the pathway to them.’ Stem cell scientist Dr Zameel Cader, from Oxford University and the John Radcliffe Hospital, described the research as ‘fascinating and exciting’. He added: ‘The structure they have generated is a long way from a real brain and the challenges for creating even a primitive foetal brain remain daunting. Hopes to recreate a real brain therefore remain distant. The proper organisation and blood supply of the brain are not present in this model and are major limitations. ‘However, their model is audacious and the similarities with some of the features of a human brain are really quite astounding.’","Scientists used stem cells to grow 3D tissue that mimics a brain .

Researchers have been given the go-ahead to exhume dozens of bodies of boys believed to have been abused and killed at a closed-down reform school. Florida's cabinet has approved a year-long dig for human remains at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, in Marianna, in the north west of the state. Investigators are trying to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths, which experts say probably occurred between 1914 and 1952. Horrors: Crosses mark graves at a cemetery at . Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida. Investigators have said . they have found at least 50 graves on the grounds . Scene: Former students spoke out several years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in this mausoleum-like building dubbed the 'White House' Investigation: Researchers believe that 96 boys died at the school and expect to find more burial sites . State officials have for years . insisted that 31 boys were interred in a tiny cemetery on the grounds of . the notorious reform school. But recent scans, using high-tech . search equipment, have found evidence of at least another 19 bodies . buried under the site - and forensic scientists fear there could be many . more. Now, thanks to an approved land use . agreement with the Department of Environmental Protection, the . University of South Florida can send in a team to search for unaccounted . bodies and to try to establish what exactly went on at the former . reform school. Quoted in the Orlando Sentinel, Pam . Bondi, a Florida cabinet member and attorney general who voted to secure . access for a dig, said: 'We're not exactly sure what happened there, . but we know it wasn't good. 'We have to look at our history. We . have to go back, we know there are unmarked graves currently on that . property that deserve a proper burial. It's the right thing to do.' The news will come as some relief to . relatives of the boys and researchers who have faced barriers with their . investigation, including a temporary restraining order issued by a . county circuit judge in October 2012, and opposition by some Jackson . County residents who fear social and economic effects in the possible . wake of any findings of a dig. Sid Riley, publisher of the Jackson . County Times, wrote on August 1: 'The bad publicity which will ensue . during the year or more of time which will be involved will seriously . hamper our local tourism development programs, as well as economic . development efforts for our county.' He urged officials not allow researchers to further investigate the case, which he said was motivated by 'greed' and was a 'waste of money'. Pam Bondi, the attorney general who voted to secure access for a dig, said: 'We're not exactly sure what happened there, but we know it wasn't good' Institution: Dozier was opened as a state reform school in January 1900 for misbehaving boys . Treatment: The boys were allegedly forced into hard labour, while others were beaten, raped or killed . Culture: A memorial or burial service around 1950. More than 20 students' burials were undocumented . In December, researchers from the . University of South Florida, in Tampa, said they found evidence of at . least 50 graves on the school's property. They also found more grave shafts in . and around an area called 'Boot Hill', which rises across a major . highway from the high, razor-wire-topped fences of the closed school. There could be even more victims, but . researchers do not have access to records after 1960 because of privacy . laws, and overgrowth on the grounds has hindered them from full . searches. Some died under unknown circumstances, according to relatives. 'We really don't know exactly how . many, or who they are,' said Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropologist at . the University of South Florida. She has a scroll-like map of spots . around the school's grounds where her ground-piercing radar has spotted . evidence of human remains. The Dozier School was legend among . adolescents for about 100 years in Florida, as the state's major reform . school, until it was closed in 2011. Discovery: University of South Florida radar research shows burial sites do not correspond with the crosses . Former students spoke out several . years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in a . mausoleum-like building dubbed the 'White House' where nine barren . cubicles held boys accused of rule breaking. Dr Kimmerle said: 'All the focus on exact numbers is not really the issue. 'Whether it's one or 20 or 40 or 60, we are talking about a child and families that are asking for information.' Dozier School was closed in June 2011 . by the Department of Juvenile Justice after a years-long controversy . over widespread physical and sexual abuse. In 2009, writer Roger Dean Kiser published The White House Boys - An American Tragedy detailing the horrors he experienced while incarcerated at Dozier School for Boys. He was sent to the reform school in 1959 when he was 12, and suffered brutal, bloody beatings in the infamous White House building. 'Little did I know that America had its own concentration camp for little boys right here in the good ole U.S. of A,' he wrote. 'A devil was hiding behind every tree, every building and even behind every blade of manicured grass.' He writes on his website: 'The terrible screams I heard and the brutal beatings I witnessed as a 12 year old will remain in my memory forever. 'The beatings I suffered are not my horrors today. My horrors are the beatings of crying boys that I had to witness before my own beatings. The horror of knowing that I was next. 'The thick concrete walls and the loud industrial fan easily muffled the horrible screams of the boys as they were beaten bloody. Some were carried to the hospital in wheelbarrows and some had to have their underwear or pajamas surgically removed from the buttocks. 'For almost thirty minutes, at age sixty-two, I stood alone in the exact room where I was almost beaten to death. With my heart racing and the side of my neck pulsating, I lit a cigarette and I cried without feeling shame.' Previous investigations and lawsuits . have been brought by the 'White House Boys' - so called because of the . name of the squat, whitewashed building where much of the abuse took . place. A group of former students sued the . state in 2010, but their case was dismissed as the statute of . limitations had expired. Other students have written books about their . experiences. Following the claims, researchers at . the University of South Florida used ground-penetrating radar and soil . samples and now believe there are many more bodies buried there than . previously reported. The largest gravesite is on the north . side of the campus, where African-American boys were buried. It is at . this site where the 31 graves are marked with white crosses, but . researchers believe they do not correspond with actual burial sites. 'We anticipated finding about 25 to 30 . grave shafts,' said Christian Wells, an assistant professor of . anthropology who led the anthropological work at the site. 'But in fact . we found a minimum of 50.' Dozier's own records show that more . than 50 children were buried on the grounds, while more than 30 other . bodies were sent elsewhere to be buried. But the school failed to record burial . locations for 22 other children who researchers learned died on the . site, the Miami Herald reported in December. Some of the children - and two adults - . died in a fire and influenza outbreak in the early 1900s, while others . were reported to have suffered from ill health or physical traumas. The U.S. Department of Justice has a . programme that could provide up to $3million for a thorough forensic . sifting of the burial areas, said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat. A $200,000 appropriation is already pending in the state legislature. Mr Nelson said he wants to find out as . much as possible and let relatives know the truth. He noted that 'the . statute of limitation on murder never runs out,' but added there is . little chance of prosecuting anyone. State Attorney Glenn Hess said only . one or two employees from the era are known to be alive, and it's . unlikely a trial could prove how a boy died or who was responsible. 'The question is, can we establish . probable cause that a crime has been committed, and who did it?' he . said. 'That's the hard part.' Families could ask their legislators . to file 'claims' bills for civil compensation, if identity could be . established from remains and if negligence might be established on the . part of the state.

John Prescott has admitted the Iraq war may have been illegal and warned that Tony Blair’s call for regime change in Iran and Syria is ‘absolutely bloody crazy’. As a series of Al Qaeda-linked car bombs and suicide blasts in Baghdad marked the tenth anniversary of the US-led invasion, the Labour peer, who served as deputy prime minister at the time of the war, said he now fears the invasion was legally wrong. He told CNN International’s Amanpour programme that while ‘shock and awe may have got rid of Saddam ... it certainly never brought peace’. Former Deputy Prime Minister John, now Lord, Prescott has raised questions about the legality of the Iraq War in an interview tonight . Then Prime Minister Tony Blair is watched by his then deputy John Prescott (left) as he addresses the House of Commons a year after the invasion in 2004. Mr Blair stated that Britain has no plans to increase the number of its troops in Iraq . Lord Prescott said: ‘You have to ask yourself, ten years on, was it justified and was it really about regime change? And if it was about regime change, I’m afraid that doesn’t make it legal.’ His criticism is significant as he was one of Mr Blair’s most loyal Cabinet ministers. He said Mr Blair’s strategy for Iraq in 2003 had been shaped by his successful interventions in Sierra Leone and Kosovo. But Lord Prescott said he was now alarmed at Mr Blair’s calls for regime change in Syria, and Iran, as it is taking steps to acquire nuclear weapons. ‘He wants to do it now in Iran, possibly, and Syria. Absolutely bloody crazy.’ Lord Prescott's comments came as former Prime Minister Tony Blair defended the decision to invade on March 19, 2003, with the U.S. by saying Iraq would have suffered a bloody revolution anyway. During the invasion and its aftermath, . 179 British service men and women were killed. Estimates of the number . of Iraqis to have died range from 110,000 to 600,000. The decision was made following legal advice by former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith gave Tony Blair the 'green light' for war just days after visiting Washington. Three days after this advice was given to the Cabinet - and . without any debate on it by ministers, British and U.S. troops moved in. It led to Britain's biggest ever political protest as more than one million protesters took to the streets of London to try to stop British participation in the war. Asked whether he regretted the invasion, Lord Prescott told CNN's Amanpour programme: 'I think you have to start from the beginning to the end. It's 10 years - time to look at those decisions. 'Right at the beginning we were hoping to get the United Nations resolution. 'There were other matters we agreed to, not least of all the road map with Bush and the Israel-Palestine, all those things were not achieved and we can see now that in the shock and awe, we may have got rid of Saddam, but it certainly never brought peace.

But at the end of the day, . you have to ask yourself was it legitimate to go in?' Asked if he feels responsible, Lord . Prescott told CNN: 'Of course I've got a share in the responsibility. It . was quite clear from the discussions that Tony and Bush were having . that he was quite prepared to go into Iraq without the support if . necessary.' Today Tony Blair, the Prime Minister at the time, spoke out to justify his decision to invade by saying Saddam Hussain would have been overthrown anyway, and it would have been a 'lot worse than Syria'. Mr . Blair told the BBC: 'I certainly think that if Saddam had still been in . power, its true there would have been, probably, an uprising among his . people. 'But I think it would have been a lot more like Syria and probably a lot worse than Syria.' Lord Prescott's comments go further than the previous doubts he has expressed over the Iraq War. In 2009 he admitted in the New . Statesman magazine that he wondered how he had agreed to go along with . Britain's participation in the war. A year later he gave evidence to the . Chilcot Inquiry, when he revealed he had doubts about the intelligence . on Saddam Hussein's weapons programmes before the invasion. Earlier this week, Lord Prescott told the Sunday Mirror why he supported the war a decade ago. He said: 'My support for action in Iraq was justified by certain conditions, as Tony agreed. The first was that any agreement to go to war had to be backed by UN resolutions. 'Secondly, . I wanted to make sure that it was not about regime change. Saddam . needed to observe the previous 17 UN resolutions on his development of . WMD. 'Thirdly, Bush had to give an agreement to implement a road map for a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian ­territories. And finally, our own Parliament had to back military action.' Lord Prescott admitted that when his government only achieved approval Mr Blair continued because he believed the war was 'justifiable'.

Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward, seen here in London shortly after the end of Falklands War, has died at 81 . Sir John ‘Sandy’ Woodward, who led the Royal Navy task force sent to retake the Falklands in 1982, has died, aged 81, following a long illness. David Cameron hailed his ‘heroic command’ and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he would be remembered by many as the Navy’s ‘fighting admiral’. When Argentina invaded the  Falklands, Sir John was a newly-appointed admiral and acted as commander of the battle fleet from the flagship aircraft carrier,  HMS Hermes. Ten weeks after the task force left Britain for the South Atlantic, the islands’ capital, Port Stanley, was liberated. During the conflict, an estimated 600 Argentines were killed along with 255 UK servicemen and three Falklands civilians. Admiral Woodward was born in  Penzance, Cornwall, and joined the Navy as a schoolboy at the age of 13, attending the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth. During the Falklands conflict he gave the controversial order to sink the Argentine cruiser, General Belgrano, killing 323. He went on to write a bestselling account of the war, called One Hundred Days. The admiral later served as Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff and before retiring went on to be the Flag aide-de camp to the Queen. Sukey Cameron, the Falkland Islands’ government representative in the  UK, tweeted: ‘Sad to learn of the death of Admiral Sir Sandy Woodward; remembering with gratitude the important part he played in Falklands Liberation.’ Two years ago Admiral Woodward told the Daily Mail he feared the islands were ‘now perilously close to being indefensible.’ A strong opponent of cuts to the Navy, he said: ‘The simple truth is without aircraft carriers and without the Americans, we would not have any hope of doing the same again today.’ In written evidence to the Commons defence committee three months ago, he warned Britain would be  unable to defend itself if cuts to the Navy continued to be made. David Cameron said: 'I am saddened to hear that Admiral Sir John 'Sandy' Woodward has . passed away -the Admiral was a truly courageous and decisive leader, . proven by his heroic command of the Royal Navy Task Force during the . Falklands conflict. Woodward, who rose to become Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, later served as Aide-de-Camp to the Queen .

'We are indebted to him for his many years of . service and the vital role he played to ensure that the people of the . Falkland Islands can still today live in peace and freedom. 'My thoughts . and prayers are with Admiral Woodward's family and friends at this . difficult time.' Defence . Secretary Philip Hammond commended Admiral Woodward on his 'magnificent . achievement' and said he would be remembered by many as the Navy’s . 'fighting admiral'. Mr . Hammond said: 'I am saddened by the news that Admiral Sir John ‘Sandy’ Woodward, has died and my thoughts are with his family at this difficult . time. 'Admiral Woodward . served his country with distinction throughout his career, but will be . best remembered by many as the Navy’s Fighting Admiral after he led the . Royal Navy Task Force, sent by Margaret Thatcher, to re-take the . Falkland Islands in 1982. 'Following . this magnificent achievement he served as the Deputy Chief of the . Defence Staff and went on before retirement to be the Flag Aide-de Camp . to the Queen.' First Sea Lord Admiral Sir George Zambellas said Admiral Woodward was highly regarded and widely respected in the military. He said: 'Admiral Sir Sandy Woodward will always be remembered for his powerful and clear command of the Royal Navy Task Force that retook the Falkland Islands in 1982. 'Undaunted by the challenge of fighting a capable enemy over 8,000 miles from the UK, in the most demanding and extreme of weather conditions, and against uncertain odds, Admiral Woodward’s inspirational leadership and tactical acumen, meshing the realities of the higher political command at home with the raw and violent fight at sea, was a major factor in shaping the success of the British forces in the South Atlantic. After playing such a crucial role in the Falklands, Woodward was Flag Officer Submarines and NATO Commander Submarines Eastern Atlantic before becoming Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Commitments). The Argentine cruiser General Belgrano sank in the South Atlantic after being torpedoed by the Royal Navy . 'Highly regarded and widely respected within the military, he will be sorely missed and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.' Woodward was born in Penzance, Cornwall, on May 1 1932, according to the Who’s Who annual.  He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, joined the navy at the age of 13, and rose through the ranks to command submarines - in 1969 he was given his first submarine to command, the hunter-killer Warspite. He went on to write a memoir of his time as the Falklands task force commander titled One Hundred Days. Admiral Woodward married Charlotte McMurtrie, with whom he had a son and a daughter, in 1960.  They later separated.  He leaves behind his longtime companion, Winifred Hoult, with whom he lived in Bosham, Sussex. When Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands on April 2, 1982, Woodward, then aged 49, was given command of the task force that was to transport British troops south to the islands. Then Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher gave him permission to sink any Argentinian warship outside its national waters - a command that was to prove decisive in the British victory over the agressors. Woodward was in command of two aircraft carriers, Invincible and Hermes, and some 50 other warships as well as support vessels.  The task force also had, beneath the waves and in secret, a complement of nuclear-powered submarines. Woodward gave the order to the Commander of HMS Conqueror, pictured, to sink the Belgrano . During the journey south, Woodward visited as many of the British ships as he could, telling the officers that the best way of their getting back to Britain alive was to 'do your absolute utmost.  So go and do it.' On the same trip, he told a BBC reporter: 'I am not in favour of blowing peoples head off. 'However as a loyal servant of the government, if I have to blow peoples heads off, I’ll do it in the most efficient and effective way I know.' In late April British land forces recaptured South Georgia, and five days later Woodward's ships were near enough to launch a bombardment. By May 1, Woodward realised that his ships were threatened by a 'pincer movement', with Argentinian aircraft carrier Veinticino de Mayo to the north, and the Belgrano and two destroyers carrying deadly Exocet missiles to the south-west. The sinking of the Beglrano gave a boost to the British war effort - and produced some memorable headlines . Woodward wanted to attack the aircraft carrier but the British submarines shadowing her had lost contact, so he turned instead to the Belgrano, saying 'I had to take one claw out of the pincer'. He ordered the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror, commanded by Christopher Wreford-Brown, to attack, and the Belgrano was torpedoed on May 2 in what would turn out to be one of the most decisive moments of the war. An estimated 323 men died in the attack, which prompted the infamous newspaper headline 'Gotcha', and while 770 survived by jumping onto liferafts, the attack utterly demoralised the Argentinian forces - as well as hardening the country's resolve. Two days later HMS Sheffield was hit by an air missile, illustrating how vulnerable the British fleet was, and there were further attacks on the Sir Galahad and the Sir Tristram. But by 14 June the Argentinians had surrendered, after fierce battles in which the navy played a crucial role, and Woodward was appointed KCB later that year.","The commander of the naval force that retook the Falklands died yesterday .

The Cyprus financial crisis could infect banks across Europe including Britain, MPs warned last night, as the full horror of the raid on expats bank accounts was laid bare. Savers in the island’s largest banks face 80 per cent of their deposits over £85,000 being wiped out, far more than anticipated, under the conditions of the EU bailout of their stricken economy. Residents of the island, and expats hoping for a quiet life in the sunshine, have spoken of losing their businesses and life savings under the rescue deal they have dubbed ‘daylight robbery’. MP Douglas Carswell has warned Britons to think carefully about which banks they put their money in . Savers at the Bank of Cyprus will see 37.5 per cent of any deposits over £85,000 converted into shares in the bank . When the £8.5billion bailout was announced it was suggested all those with money in Cypriot banks would be asked to pay the price, leading all of them to close their doors for two weeks. But under the emergency rescue deal agreed last week, only ‘large depositors’ will now take a hammering to raise £5billion of the funds  – including the island’s 60,000 British residents. Big depositors at Bank of Cyprus, the island’s largest bank may be forced to accept losses of up to 60 per cent, under the package to save the country from bankruptcy, officials said on Saturday. Those who have invested more than £85,000 will lose 37.5 per cent in money that will be converted into bank shares. They will keep these, but there are fears their entire value could be wiped out. Thousands of Cypriots demonstrate to protest against the harsh treatment imposed on Cyprus by the Eurogroup earlier this week . And in a second raid, they could lose up to 22.5 per cent more, depending on how much is needed to prop up the bank’s reserves. Experts will determine this in the next 90 days. The size of the raid for such investors had been expected to be only 30 to 40 per cent. Cypriot officials say large savers at Laiki, the second largest bank, could lose as much as 80 per cent of their savings. Eurosceptic MP Douglas Carswell said yesterday the catastrophic bailout would send the island’s economy into collapse, and have serious consequences for the banking system across the Eurozone. He said: ‘The thing that should frighten us all is that the clowns that have done this to Cyprus are still running the European Union, they are still presiding over us. ‘This isn’t a bailout, it’s the collapse of Cyprus’s financial system and this is the price. This is not about Russian oligarchs, it’s about ordinary paying to rescue the European elite from their own stupid euro project. Laiki Bank customers are also reported to be facing the loss of 80 per cent of their deposits above the £85,000 limit . Banks in Cyprus are open for normal business but with strict restrictions on how much money their clients can access, after being shut for nearly two weeks . ‘I think for the first time in living memory, people in Britain should make certain that they spread their risks and think carefully as to which bank you put your money in. ‘We’ve been led for generations to think deposits are safe but the modern banking system means there are more people who think they are owed money than there is money in the banks. ‘We should not feel smugness, as our Government like the rest of the Eurozone has been too busy trying to rescue bankers from our investment folly. Is this run by people you can trust? ‘They talked about monetary union creating stability in the Eurozone, in Cyprus it’s killed the economy and created real hardship and poverty. Nobody in their right mind would invest in Cyprus and southern Europe. ‘If people in Cyprus have lost 60-80 per cent of their deposits, who in their right mind have that much in their account in Spain or Greece or Portugal? It’s not just about Cyprus, it sends a powerful signal to the Eurozone.’ Ordinary Cypriots step in the streets to protest against the massive ""haircuts"" imposed by The European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund . Cyprus’ Finance Minister Michalis Sarris said the measures were taken to put the Bank of Cyprus on a solid footing. He said: ‘We suffered a serious blow without doubt ... but we now have a bank which is reformed and ready to assume its role in the Cypriot economy.’ Experts predict a huge social impact, with unemployment on the island, currently at 15 per cent, set to soar, and many people vulnerable to losing their homes or being forced under the breadline. Banks finally opened last week with a raft of restrictions, including daily withdrawal limits of £200 for individuals and £4200 for businesses, and caps on money that can be taken out of the country. Tryfonas Neokleous, owner of a clothes shop in central Nicosia said: ‘Europe shouldn’t have allowed this disaster to happen here. Cyprus was paradise and they’ve turned it into hell. I don’t expect anything anymore. People are going to spend their money on food and everything else they’ve been deprived of the last 15 days.’ Pantelis Panayotou, a 70-year-old jeweller said: ‘People are numb.’","The island's largest savers face losing 80% of their deposits over £85,000 .

Banned: Wright-Phillips claims he did not know about the driving ban as he doesn't open his post - his agent does . Millionaire footballer Shaun Wright-Phillips avoided jail yesterday for driving while banned because he was 'blissfully unaware' his licence had been revoked. The former England star told ­Uxbridge Magistrates' Court he was unaware he should not have been on the road, and claimed he had not seen the legal papers banning him from driving because they had been sent to his agent's address. The winger, who plays for QPR, had missed a string of court summons after his £200,000 Bentley was clocked doing 79mph on a 50mph stretch at Esher in Surrey, on March 28 last year. The 31-year-old's luxury car was registered at his agent's address in Luton, Bedfordshire, which is where the important document informing him about his disqualification, was sent. Several reminders were issued, including one to the former Manchester City and Chelsea star's home in Surrey, but Wright-Phillips claimed in court yesterday he had not seen any of them. He was finally banned from driving in his absence in December. Then, on January 21 this year, Met Police officers arrested Wright-Phillips at QPR's training ground in Harlington, West London, after spotting his insurance had been invalidated during a routine check. He was charged with driving while banned and driving without insurance. At his trial yesterday, he admitted to both offences. Previous conviction: Wright-Phillips, pictured here driving a Bentley in 2009, was also banned from driving in 2004 after being caught speeding . Defending Wright-Phillips, his lawyer . Gwyn Lewis argued he should escape a further ban or jail as he was . ­'blissfully unaware' of the papers. Mr . Lewis, dubbed Merlin the Magician for his ability to make 'many . worrying cases disappear', said: 'We will be making a special reasons . argument that the defendant shouldn’t be endorsed with points, a ban or . jail, which would normally be the case.' Speedster: Wright-Phillips has played for West London QPR since 2011 following his move from Manchester City . Magistrates accepted his case and fined the player £800 and ordered him to pay £85 costs with an £80 surcharge for the first charge of driving while banned. The bench accepted he 'would not have expected to receive the mail'. Wright-Phillips, who was banned for speeding in 2004 by Crewe magistrates, told the court: 'From now on I will definitely open the mail even if it is junk.' He left court without commenting.

Stopping traffic: Flights to and from the capital's Haneda airport were cancelled last week, parts of the expressways temporarily closed and local train services were delayed thanks to the swirling snow . A Furisode, named for its long swinging sleeves, is a formal kimono for unmarried women. The longer the sleeve, the higher the status. Brides wear them on their wedding day. It is usually made from Rinzu (silk) or Chirimen (crepe) in an 'Eba' design: meaning the pattern is spread over panels like a painting. It is worn with an Obi - a colourful sash tied in a large bow at the back. Stiffeners and ribbons add shape and decoration. A fine, formal obi might cost more than the kimono itself. A hip- or thigh-length kimono-like jacket called a Haori can be worn on top to add formality. A robe called a Nagajuban, . worn beneath the outer kimono, keeping the delicate fabric clean . by preventing contact with the wearer's skin. Only the collar edge . shows. A thin half-slip-like piece of underwear called a Susoyoke is worn under the nagajuban. A narrow sash (Karihimo), often made . of silk or wool, can hold virtually anything in place. A karihimo worn . around the hips to create the extra fold or ohashori in a woman's . kimono is called Koshihimo, literally 'hip ribbon'. On their feet, the girls wear Tabi, ankle socks with a separation between the big toe and other toes. These are worn with Geta, sandals with thick wooden soles that keep feet well above the ground. A fabric thong runs between the toes and two supporting wooden teeth are fixed underneath, sometimes with metal plates on. At times, the girls looked solemn and . reverential beneath translucent white umbrellas, with their matching . fur stoles wrapped tightly around their necks to keep out the cold. At . others, they laughed hysterically with friends, clutching Disney . carrier bags and texting furiously - looking just like the tech-savvy, . fashionable face of Japanese popular culture today. The elegant Furisode kimonos are . likely to be the most extravagant clothes a Japanese woman will . wear until her wedding day. The majority of young men celebrating wear suits for . the occasion, although some still wear the more traditional male . kimono. A Furisode can cost in excess of . £6,000 ($10,000), so many rent the outfit to reduce the cost. Hours are . spent in hairdressers and salons getting ready for the big event. Seijin no Hi, or Coming of Age Day, is a national holiday that celebrates the transition into adulthood for young Tokyoites, according to Tokyotopia.com. They are now able to vote, legally buy alcohol and tobacco and to be tried as adults if they break the law. The ceremony came into being as a Shinto religious rite for members of samurai families. The boys' ceremony was originally called Gempuku and could take place between the ages of 10 and 16. During the event, they would be presented with a headdress called an Eboshi and receive an adult male name denoting their new role and responsibilities as an adult, such as marriage. The girls' celebration, then called Mogi, would occur during the ages of 12 and 16, when they would receive a special kimono and be allowed to dress as an adult female for the first time. The age of 20 was set as the year a young person moved into adulthood in 1876, during the Edo period. The modern version of the occasion came into existence in 1948 and now takes place on the second Monday of January each year. A formal gathering attended by parents and organised by government office 'Seijin Shiki' marks the start of proceedings. In . recent years, some young Tokyoites can be heard heckling or letting off . fireworks rather than listening dutifully to the sometimes lengthy and . serious speeches explaining their new responsibilities as adults in . society. After that, many . 20-year-olds visit a shrine with their families before the day ends in a . more relaxed manner with young people gathering for parties with . friends.

Trauma: Paul and Sarah Fudacz are suing after a hospital botched their kidney transplant . 'Wasted': The hospital threw out the kidney Paul was donating to save his sister's life . She said when her brother first offered to donate one of his kidneys it was 'the most amazing moment of my life'. 'This was going to be the end of it, I was finally going to start feeling better,' she said. Surgeons at the University of Toledo . Medical Center removed the organ from Paul on August 10, 2012 . to give it to his Sarah, but a nurse, . Judith Moore, threw it away as she discarded the contents of a slush . machine before the operation was over. Doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the organ for two hours after the accident was discovered. Sarah realized there had been a problem as she was taken out of surgery. When she lifted her surgical gown, she could see there was no incision. 'I just cried because I couldn't believe that I was back where I started,' she said. 'I should have been recovering. They threw away my life, they threw away something that meant so much to me.' Her brother told Good Morning American: 'What really brought it home to me was seeing my sister walking around fine and I'm in bed in pain.' Surgery: Paul recalls being in pain after having his kidney removed while his sister, who had not been operated on, was able to walk around . Life saving: Sarah had to be found a new donor after Paul's kidney was discarded . 'Beautiful moment': Sarah was moved by her brother's offer to give her a kidney . Paul, who was 17 when he underwent the surgery for his sister, is now left with only one-functioning kidney after the hospital threw away his healthy organ. Medical expert Dr Richard Besser said: 'When you donate an organ for a relative it's beautiful though you are putting yourself at slight risk.' He described the mistake as a 'never event ... as it should never happen' and added that people had lost their jobs because of it. A spokesman for the hospital said: We apologize sincerely. We have done our best to find many remedies to help those affected move forward.' After consulting with the family, physicians decided not to risk using the kidney because they thought it was likely another compatible donor could be found. Mix up: Paul Fudacz, believed to be pictured with his sister Sarah (center) and an unidentified friend (left), donated his kidney to Sarah last year but it was accidentally thrown away by a nurse . The hospital, which found another donor for Sarah and covered her traveling costs so she could undergo the surgery in Colorado, is now trying to dismiss their lawsuit and recover its own costs. Sarah, John, . their parents, and their four siblings filed a lawsuit on July 29 against . UTMC in the Court of Claims in Columbus.They individually demand $25,000, plus interest and the costs of . the suit. Their attorney Jim Arnold said UTMC had been accommodating after the mix up but that the Ohio attorney general’s office, which . represents UTMC, would not accept some of the family's demands. On Tuesday, the medical center responded to the Fudacz family lawsuit, acknowledging the organ was discarded but denying some of the Fudacz . claims, the Toledo Blade reported. Suing: The siblings' parents, Ellen and Paul (pictured), are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit . It did not ask the court to dismiss the charge of criminal negligence, but did dispute the family's claim that there was a 'parental loss of consortium' and 'sibling loss of . consortium' - the legal terms for when an incident affects relationships. Surgeon: Dr Michael Rees continues to work at the hospital but two nurses have been fired . There is 'no right to . compensation for parental loss of consortium of an adult,' it said. 'There is no right to compensation for sibling loss of . consortium in a non-death case.' Larry . Burns, the university's vice president for external affairs, said he . did not know how much the medical center paid the family, including the cost of the trip to Colorado. After the mix-up, live-donor kidney transplants . were suspended voluntarily at the medical center - and there was a host of staff changes. Dr. Michael Rees, who performed the surgery, still works at the medical center while two nurses, Moore and Melanie Lemay, no longer work there and the administrator of surgical services, Edwin Hall, was . placed on paid administrative leave. Moore, who threw away the slush machine contents before the surgery was over, resigned on . September 10 last year, and the hospital fired Lemay, a full-time nurse. Lemay, who took over when Moore went on a lunch break, did not update her on . the status of the surgery when she returned from her break, disciplinary records showed, the Blade reported. She has now sued the hospital for wrongful discharge, . defamation, slander, and libel and seeks damages exceeding $25,000.This kind of accident is unheard of in . organ transplant centers and it was a good decision not to use the . kidney, Dr William Harmon, director of kidney transplantation at Boston .

Drivers including British stars Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button would start from a grid outside Buckingham Palace and race around a 3.2-mile West End circuit taking in sights such as Nelson's Column and Piccadilly Circus. Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone is said to have offered to pay more than £35million to stage the grand prix in the capital. Scroll down for video teaser . Pole position: The 3.2mile circuit takes the drivers past a number of London landmarks, such as Buckingham Palace . London Grand Prix . Experts believe that as many as . 120,000 spectators would watch the race, which Mr Ecclestone believes . would be even more impressive than the Monaco Grand Prix - currently the . most famous and glamorous of motor racing’s street circuits. He . said: ‘Think what it would do for tourism. It would be fantastic — good . for London, good for England — a lot better than the Olympics.’ Should London host a Formula One street race? Mr . Ecclestone, 81, has long wanted London to host a grand prix, having . seen the huge potential after a Formula One demonstration event on . Regent Street in 2004 attracted thousands to watch Button and another . British former world champion, Nigel Mansell, in action. He . said that he was prepared to promote the race, which is likely to be . staged in the summer and is expected to generate as much as £100million . in takings from spectators and tourists. The . cost of hosting a Grand Prix runs to millions of pounds, but Mr . Ecclestone believes a London race would be so popular that it would pay . for itself. The event, to be called the London . GP, could even be held a night to help create what planners believe will . be a 'carnival atmosphere'. London Mayor Boris Johnson gave qualified support today to the plans. Mr Johnson said he was 'broadly positive' about the plan as long as air quality and noise issues were addressed. Speaking . as he launched a new cable car system across the River Thames in London . today, the Mayor said: 'I am always interested in projects that attract . jobs and bring growth.' He said it was important to see if there was 'a really good economic case' for a London Grand Prix. Mr . Johnson went on: 'The question of air quality and noise impact will . have to be looked at. I am broadly positive providing we can satisfy the . air quality and noise issues.' Ont he grid: The proposed track would begin and end on The Mall . Champions: British drivers Lewis Hamilton (left) and Jenson Button (right) are believed to have been involved in designing the circuit, while Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone (right) is said to have offered to pay more than £35million to stage the grand prix in the capital . The race was originally proposed by the Santander bank, which sponsors the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. It would not take place for several years and is expected to complement, rather than replace, the annual Silverstone meeting. Santander spokesman Nav Sidhu told . Metro: 'There's a tremendous appetite for Formula One in the UK - more . than anywhere else - and London is more than capable of hosting world . class events whether they be the marathon, the jubilee or rock concerts . in Hyde Park. 'Putting a temporary Formula One . circuit into a city like London would involve serious challenges, but . every single one has been met.' Hamilton . and Button are believed to have been involved in the design of the . proposed circuit, which would see drivers racing at full throttle for . three-quarters of each lap. The course would begin on The Mall . outside Buckingham Palace, turning towards St James's Palace before . heading on towards the Ritz hotel. Iconic: The Houses of Parliament would be part of the dramatic backdrop to the race . Sightseeing: The proposed Formula One race in London would be contested on a circuit taking in landmarks such as Piccadilly Circus . The drivers would race at 180mph on a straight along Piccadilly to a corner near the Wellington Monument on Park Lane. Cars would then come back past Buckingham Palace to another straight along Birdcage Walk to Parliament Square. The closing stages of the circuit would take in the Embankment, Trafalgar Square and Admiralty Arch, ending back on the Mall where the race began. Nigel Currie, director of leading sports agency Brand-Rapport, told the Times that takings at the event could be double or even treble the £100million estimate. He said: 'It could be a commercial bonanza for Formula One and London. A successful London Olympics will show that there is an appetite for big events and bringing a grand prix to the people on their doorstep will attract massive attention.' Last week a company called International Transport Solutions revealed plans for a London Grand Prix around the Olympic Park site but Mr Ecclestone insisted he knew nothing about the proposal.

The ensemble appears on Wednesday night (left) and yesterday (right). Only the shoes had been changed - from high black heels to zebra ballet flats . Social life: Like her mother Sarah Ferguson, Princess Beatrice appears to have a penchant for partying . Teamed with a chic sparkling pink Anya Hindmarch clutch and a classic pair of black patent court shoes, the skirt and T-shirt combined to create the perfect party look. And the princess clearly wasn't the only one to think so. During her time at the racy night spot, she was the recipient of numerous admiring male glances and was photographed enveloped in the arms of an enthusiastic male friend at the end of the night, who planted a kiss on the smiling princess's head. Boyfriend Dave Clark, meanwhile, was nowhere to be seen thanks to the pressures of his work at Richard Branson's space travel company, Virgin Galactic. The next evening, the outfit was back for an evening with Princess Eugenie and the Duchess of York, although the princess had found time to exchange her court shoes for pretty zebra print pumps. Smiling broadly as she left members-only club LouLou's, Princess Beatrice looked remarkably fresh for a girl on a two-day party mission - even if her outfit was not.

A former policeman who became a feared cartel boss has been arrested on suspicion of killing hundreds of people and dumping their bodies in mass graves. Mario Nunez, also known as 'M-10', was a key figure in Mexico's long-running drug war, and was accused of involvement with the murder of 350 people in 2011. Yesterday police in the northern state of Chihuahua detained the 39-year-old in the border city of Ciudad Juarez. Arrest: Mario Nunez has been detained on suspicion of helping to kill 350 people in Mexico's drug war . Nunez began working with the Juarez Cartel before joining the rival Sinaloa organsation led by Mexico's most-wanted man, Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman. The government partially blames Nunez for an upsurge in drug violence that brought shootouts in broad daylight, ambushes of police and kidnappings to Ciudad Juarez, which is just over the border from El Paso, Texas. Court documents say Guzman hired Nunez and gave him the job of snatching the smuggling corridors into the U.S. from the local Juarez Cartel, through ordering gangs of hit men to carry out killings that included grisly mutilations and decapitations. The Juarez Cartel lost ground to the Sinaloa organisation in a three-year battle that wound down in 2011. Violence: Police are pictured outside a park after the latest flare-up of drug-related bloodshed . But Nunez's criminal career continued, according to the authorities. The Mexican government claims Nunez's power struggle with another drug boss in the spring of 2011 resulted in the killing of 350 people, whose bodies were unearthed in 23 mass graves in the state of Durango. 'Much of the violence seen in the states of Chihuahua and Durango is partially because of the actions carried out by this man,' a government spokesman said. Hunt: Mexican soldiers are pictured looking for poppy fields in operations aimed at the drug cartels . Nunez faces up to 40 years in prison if he is found guilty of the alleged offences. He is also wanted in the U.S. on charges drug trafficking, although it is not known whether American authorities will try to extradite him. Violence stemming from the actions of drug cartels reached a horrific peak during the presidency of Felipe Calderon, who vowed to crack down on the criminal gangs. It has calmed down somewhat since he left office last year, but 1,000 people still die as a result of drug-related violence every month.","Mario Nunez was lieutenant to Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin Guzman .

Similar to the idea that we can form a chain to anyone else on the planet through seven degrees of seperation, the game starts with someone naming an actor, and challenging their friends to find a connection to Kevin Bacon in as few links as possible. Now . Google - well known for sneaking 'Easter eggs' into its search engine - . has, at long last, brought the 'Bacon number' directly into its results . pages, making the game a lot more visible - but perhaps upsetting film . fans who prefer a challenge over instant gratification. But kudos to any fan who can get to from Corrie's Ken to Kevin Bacon in just four moves. From Barlow to Bacon: The chain passes from Ken, to actress Una Stubbs through co-star Johnny Briggs, to Michael Fasssbander due to a shared appearance in 'Angel', to Kevin Bacon in X-Men . The game was borne out of a statement the actor made in 1994, when he said he has worked . with everyone in Hollywood, or knew someone who had worked with them. Kevin Bacon is perhaps best known for his roles . in A Few Good Men, Tremors, Mystic River, Wild Things, and is one of . Hollywood's most prolific actors. With over 50 Hollywood films under his belt, you can quickly get to any notable actor, director or crewmen by filling in the blanks - and then the fun is in getting to his name in as few as links as possible. For example: Simon Pegg, famed for Spaced . and Shaun of the Dead, was in Mission Impossible III with Tom Cruise, . who was in A Few Good Men with Kevin Bacon. The Bacon Number: typing an actor's name followed by 'bacon number' gives you a Hollywood countdown to the Mystic River star . Centre of the universe? Almost every actor can be linked to Kevin Bacon, usually within two or three people - for example Simon Pegg, from Shaun of the Dead, can make it in two links . When the game started - and began spreading over the Internet as various fan-sites built up at the end of the 90s, it was quite difficult to get to the actor within a few links. But, 20 years down the line, with actors adding to their CV and building more connections, it is now surprisingly difficult to find actors with more than three or four degrees of separation from Bacon. Indeed, even the Coronation Street and Eastenders cast are only three or four links away from the actor. One for the Corrie fans: William Roache, best known to us as Ken Barlow, is only four degrees of separation from Bacon . ... And, to be soap agnostic: Eastenders fans can enjoy the fact that Bianca is only three steps from Hollywood's centre . Google has yet to comment on the reasons for the new search engine trick. But the search engine has a history of sneaking pranks into search results - if you want just one example, search 'tilt' on Google right now. Or type recursion - and then get annoyed as you get lost in a cycle of 'Did you mean... Recursion?' If you want to give it a go, type an actor's name before the Bacon Number below.

A Domino’s delivery driver lost control of his car while delivering a pizza in Beaumont in 2012 and hit a vehicle carrying Ruth and and her husband Devavaram Christopher. Ruth Christopher died the next day; her husband, now 70, was injured severely. The accident was blamed on defective, worn tires on the delivery vehicle. The driver was also cited for speeding. Jurors concluded on Tuesday that Domino’s was partly responsible by not enforcing a policy that drivers' vehicles be inspected. A Domino’s spokesman says the company plans to appeal. Tim McIntyre, vice president of communications for the Ann Arbor-based Domino's, said the company offered its condolences for the 'terrible accident'. But he said it was difficult to comprehend 'that a corporation is responsible for whether an independent franchise employee is driving on bald tires'. 'The employee in question did not work for us; he worked for an established independent franchise operation.

Reverend Al Sharpton has been seen with an attractive young woman on his arm at various recent events and according to the woman herself, they're dating. Sharpton, 58, attended the New York County Democratic Committee Award Ceremony on Monday night accompanied by Aisha McShaw, a 35-year-old from Westchester, New York. It's the first relationship Sharpton has made public since the demise of his 24-year marriage to Kathy Jordan in 2004. New couple: Sharpton and McShaw were pictured together in February this year . McShaw told reporters at Monday's event that she is a 'personal stylist'. The New York Daily News reports that when the attractive younger woman was questioned about her relationship to Sharpton, she said, 'I'm his girlfriend,' before being steered away from the reporter by Sharpton. McShaw was wearing a form-fitting black-and-white gown to the ceremony and certainly looked the part of a stylist, though her LinkedIn page describes her as a personal banker at Wells Fargo. Looking sharp: Rev. Al Sharpton cosies up with Aisha McShaw (right) and a friend . Sharpton's new squeeze comes in the wake of his 2004 divorce and 125lb weight loss in 2010. The charismatic activist and preacher scoffs at the idea of a 'reinvention', though. 'I don't evolve, I'm ""reinvented"",' he told Roland Martin in 2010. 'Like it's part of some slick strategy.' Amicable: Sharpton and his ex-wife Kathy Jordan, pictured here in 1998, divorced in 2004 . Sharpton attributes his dramatic weight loss to a change of diet and says he doesn't eat meat, but has fish twice a week and lots of fruit and vegetables. He and McShaw have been seen together at black-tie events around the country over the past few months. Evolved: (left) Sharpton with his daughters in 2004 and (right) discussing planned 'Justice for Trayvon' vigils in 100 cities across the U.S. yesterday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman . The well-coiffed host of MSNBC's PoliticsNation is usually outspoken but has remained tight-lipped about his love-life. After the decline of Sharpton's marriage, a spokesperson said he and ex-wife Jordan had simply grown apart. The split was said to be amicable.

A 17-year-old boy has been arrested for allegedly murdering his 11-year-old neighbor after she was found in a ditch three miles from her home - with her devoted dog guarding her body. Christopher Sowell was arrested for first-degree murder in Gosnell, Arkansas on Wednesday, just hours after the body of missing Jessica Williams was found by Big Lake in Mississippi County. Authorities have not said how the young . girl died, but her devastated father Eric Williams said it looked as though she had drowned . in two feet of water. Tragic: Jessica Williams vanished on Tuesday night and her body was found in a ditch three miles away on Wednesday morning - with her loyal pet dog, Rhyback (right), standing over her . Arrest: Christopher Sowell, 17, was arrested late Wednesday night and will be charged as an adult . Jessica had been missing since Tuesday night when she vanished while playing with her dog in her father's front yard as he showered and prepared dinner. A neighbor passed by and told him they had seen the young girl's bike at the end of the road - but that she was nowhere in sight. 'I said something don't feel right, so I . drove on down to [a neighbor's] house. I said, ""Have you seen her?"" He ain't . seen her,' Williams told WREG. 'We started going door to door all the way . down here.' Neighbors layunched a massive search for the girl, riding four wheelers in the farm fields to look for her - with no success. Scene: Her bike was found near her home and her body was found in a ditch by this lake the next day . Home: She was last seen playing outside her father's home, pictured, with her dog on Tuesday night . Her father eventually reported her missing at 9pm, after she had been missing for around three hours, and said that he had last seen her outside his home just southwest of Gosnell. Mississippi County Criminal Investigations Commander Robb Rounsavall said the girl's bicycle was found in a ditch near a house further down the road. Her body was miles away from the site - and her father and investigators agreed it was not found anywhere where she could have easily walked or taken her bike. It was found at 6.30am on Wednesday, with her loyal puppy, Rhyback, standing over her body, her father said. Loss: Jessica, who was allegedly killed by a 17-year-old neighbor, loved the outdoors and animals . Shock: Her father, Eric Williams, said his beloved daughter had dreams of becoming a rancher . Her body is being sent to the Arkansas State Crime Lab to determine her cause of death. Jessica's uncle Tim Southern expressed his shock at the senseless death. 'You . know, why would you want to take an 11-year-old and do this? I mean . she's done nothing to you. She's just beginning life,' he said. 'She . loved life itself. You know she loved her grandma, grandpas, her mom and . dad, especially her sister, little cousins.' Mr Williams described the 11-year-old . girl as a tomboy who loved her pets, was friendly with neighbors and . loved bouncing on their trampoline. 'She wanted to be a rancher,' he said. 'She loved horses. She loved animals.' Sowell will be arraigned this afternoon and is being charged as an adult in the case.

A Labour MP threatened to punch Michael Gove after claiming the Education Secretary hurled a ‘Nazi’ jibe at him in angry scenes after the Commons vote on Syria. Labour MP Dai Havard said that Mr Gove, one of David Cameron’s closest Cabinet allies, called him a ‘National Socialist,’ the original title of Hitler’s Nazi party. Burly Welsh ex-union leader Mr Havard, known as ‘Dai Hard’ to colleagues, complained to Labour Whips and told them: ‘Michael Gove just called me a National Socialist. Tell him if he does it again I’ll deck him.’ 'National Socialist': Michael Gove used the term in a row with Labour MP Dai Harvard, but sources close to the Tory Education Secretary said he was referring to Syrian President Bashar Assad, and not the Welsh MP . Sources close to Mr Gove – who wanted Britain to take military action against the Syrian regime – confirmed he used the term ‘National Socialist’ in the confrontation with Mr Havard after the 10.30pm vote on Thursday. And they said Mr Gove also told him: ‘You will have to live with this on your conscience.’ But they insisted the Cabinet Minister was referring to Syrian president Bashar Assad as a ‘National Socialist’ and was not comparing Mr Havard to the Nazis. Mr Gove’s friends said he had nothing to apologise for. ‘He was telling the truth,’ said one. But sources close to Mr Havard hit back. ‘Gove lost his rag,’ said one. ‘Everyone knows “National Socialists” means Nazis. It was meant as an insult and Dai was right to be outraged.’ 'If he does it again I¿ll deck him': Labour MP 'Dai Hard' Harvard was furious at the Nazi jibe he feels Mr Gove was directing at him . Tory MP Gavin Barwell, Parliamentary aide to Mr Gove, witnessed the row. He said last night: ‘We were filing out of the debating chamber just after the Syria vote and Michael was very upset. ‘He told Labour MPs, including Dai Havard, they were a disgrace and were giving succour to Assad, who was a National Socialist. Dai said “What did you just say to me?” He was very cross and said, “Say that again and I’ll thump you.” ‘But it was a misunderstanding. Michael was calling Assad a National Socialist. Dai was still angry later on when I talked to him in the Members’ Smoking Room to try to sort it out. We ended up having a civilised conversation about whether or not Assad was a National Socialist.’ It was not the only bad-tempered exchange involving Mr Gove. He told Labour Defence spokesman Jim Murphy: ‘You are appeasing Assad.’ Glaswegian Mr Murphy shouted back: ‘F*** off you bully. You’re angry because you lost.’ The ‘appeasement’ jibe also has toxic echoes of Hitler. It was the damning charge levelled at those who tried to do a deal with the Nazi leader in an attempt to avoid war. Mr Cameron was also involved in heated exchanges with Labour leader Ed Miliband, accusing him of political treachery and ratting on a pledge to support him over air strikes against Syria. On the eve of Thursday’s Commons vote, when Mr Miliband told the Prime Minister he would not back him, Mr Cameron accused him of betraying America and siding with Assad’s Russian allies. ‘You are going against our greatest ally and siding with Lavrov!’ shouted Mr Cameron, referring to Russian Defence Minister Sergei Lavrov. Mr Miliband said: ‘This is getting us nowhere’ – and slammed the phone down. Shortly after the Commons defeat inflicted by Labour MPs and Tory rebels, a seething Mr Cameron told a colleague: ‘I understand those who voted against me for sincere reasons of principle, but Miliband is just playing politics. He put his party before his country.’ A source close to Mr Cameron said: ‘Miliband’s behaviour was disgusting. He ignored the interests of his nation to score a cheap party political success.’ 'You've put your party before your country: Prime Minister David Cameron, left, accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of ignoring British interests to score a 'cheap' political point by opposing attacks on Syria . Miner’s son Mr Havard, 63, is proud of his radical Welsh roots, claiming he is ‘independent enough to fight a corner when needs be’. In 2006, he denounced Prime Minister Tony Blair for his ‘misdirected obsession’ with backing George Bush’s foreign policy, and called for a ceasefire in the Middle East. The Merthyr Tydfil MP lost his job as Commons Defence Committee vice chairman amid claims that he had insulted a senior Falklands Islands official during a parliamentary trip to mark the 30th anniversary of the Argentine invasion. Keen horseman Mr Havard was said to be upset when plans for him to go riding on the island were scrapped. The Left-winger, who spent 20 years as a union official before entering the Commons in 2001, also hit trouble last year when it was revealed he had lodged a 45p expenses claim for the mileage costs of attending an Remembrance Day service a mile from his home. President Assad’s party is the Syrian-led branch of the Socialist Ba’ath Party, which has ruled Syria since 1963. The Ba’ath Party, which was also the ruling party in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, wants a single Arab socialist nation. National Socialism, which translates as ‘Nationalsozialismus’ in German, is more generally associated with the Nazis. It has its roots in the 17th Century Prussian tradition of military discipline. Hitler used it to justify the Holocaust. There are some parallels with Hitler: Assad runs a totalitarian state enforced by a slavishly loyal military and secret police who routinely torture, imprison and kill his political opponents. And his father, President Hafez Assad, gave shelter in Syria to Nazi war criminals.","Welsh MP accuses top Tory Michael Gove of calling him a national socialist .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:51 EST, 23 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:17 EST, 23 June 2013 . Researchers say that recently unearthed photos of the remote Pacific island near the site of a reef where they believe Amelia Earhart's plane may have landed during her doomed 1937 flight around the world could prove that the aviator and her navigator lived for a time as castaways, and didn't die in a supposed crash as previously thought. Last month, researchers contracted by The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) found what they say are sonar images of Earhart's plane just off the coast of what is now Nikumaroro Island, which is part of the Phoenix Islands roughly 3,000 miles northeast of Australia in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Proof? Researchers say these photos of Gardner Island could prove whether Amelia Earhart ended up a castaway after landing her plane in the Pacific Ocean in 1937 . Gardner Island: This tiny, Pacific island had its share of visitors before Earhart supposedly landed her plane on a reef off its northwestern shore . At the time of Earhart's flight, the island was known as Gardner Island, a then-uninhabited, seven-mile stretch of sand, shrubs and trees with a large lagoon at its center. TIGHAR believes Earhart's plane went off course while en-route to Howland Island, roughly 800 miles north of Gardner Island. The group believes the plane made a safe landing on a long, smooth reef just off the coast of Gardner Island and then made it safely to shore, where Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan lived until their demise. The new photos, discovered by Matthew O'Sullivan, keeper of photographs at the New Zealand Air Force Museum in Christchurch, are aerial photos of the island taken in December of 1938, more than a year after Earhart's plane supposedly landed there. The 45 photos - found in an unlabeled box containing a sheet of paper saying 'Gardner Island' - are part of a set of aerial obliques taken by a Supermarine Walrus launched . from HMS Leander in support of the New Zealand Pacific Aviation Survey conducted as the British Navy was looking for possible Pacific landing strips for seaplanes, or even an airfield. Wreckage: The 'Bevington object' is believed to be the location of a piece of Earhart's plane . Aim: The purpose of the expedition was to test the hypothesis that the Earhart aircraft, after landing on the reef at Gardner Island (now Nikumaroro), was subsequently washed over the reef edge, broke up in the surf, and sank . 'Flying laboratory': Earhart's Lockheed Electra took off from Oakland Airport on the first leg of her proposed world spanning flight . First: Earhart was the first female pilot to fly solo over the Atlantic Ocean . As Discovery News points out, the photos were taken about a month before the island's first 'official' habitation, which suggest that any artifacts found on the island would have had to come from Earhart, or been washed ashore. 'For 25 years we have struggled to tease details from a handful of . printed photos. Now we have an amazing array of detailed aerial images . of every part of the atoll taken before the first colonists, or even the . New Zealand Survey party, set foot on the island,' Ric Gillespie, . executive director of TIGHAR, told the publication. What Gillespie and Discovery News fail to mention, however, is the fact that the island had residents long before the British Navy's 1938 attempt to colonize the island - although they weren't 'official' inhabitants. In fact, people had been living on the island as far back as 1915, when British entrepreneur John Arundel acquired a license to use the island to plant coconut trees. As part of Arundel's project, 20 workers were brought to Gardner Island to run his coconut operation. They even built iron-roofed structures, which remained on the island even after a severe drought put an end to the project and the islanders were forced off. Gardner Island had additional human contact prior to Earhart's flight when, in 1929, the SS Norwich City crashed into a reef off the island's northwest corner - likely the same reef where TIGHAR claims Earhart landed her plane. Wreckage: A close-up view of what scientists say could be the undercarriage of Earhart's plane is pictured at the reef at Nikumaroro Island in 1937 . Analysis: A graphic shows the area looked at by TIGHAR team . Discovery: This bottle of St Joseph's lineament was found on a desert island in the area Amelia Earhart is believed to have crashed on an ill-fated voyage around the world in 1937 . Eleven of the ship's 35 crew members died in the wreck and the fire that engulfed the ship after it ran aground. The remainder of the crew lived on the island - in collapsed structures from the failed Arundale project - for several days until they were rescued. In the past, however, TIGHAR, which has made more than 10 trips to the island in search of evidence to support its theories about Earhart, claims to have found several items on the island that suggest the aviator - or at the very least, a female who lived in the 1930s - spent some time on the island, including American beauty and skin care products that may have dated to the 1930s, and a shattered mirror from a woman's cosmetic . compact. TIGHAR has many critics, though, none of whom buy the group's theories of Earhart's final days. 'Not to impugn [the head of TIGHAR], but I don’t think [the group] found anything on any expedition,' a curator at the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum said during a 2012 interview with the New Republic.","Earhart's plane disappeared in the Pacific Ocean during her doomed 1937 flight around the world .

Fourteen McDonald’s employees from Baltimore are suing a co-worker for allegedly stealing more than $100 million in lottery winnings from a ticket that the employees say they had purchased together. The lawsuit claims that 37-year-old Mirlande Wilson bought a winning lottery ticket with the group’s pooled money and then avoided giving them their payouts – even though Wilson never actually claimed the Mega Millions jackpot award. Wilson briefly won TV and Internet fame in April for claiming to have won a ticket for the the Mega Millions jackpot, which totaled $656 million at the time, and then failing to produce the winning ticket. She eventually claimed that she had misplaced it. 'Winner': Mirlande Wilson originally said she had the $100m winning ticket, but then claimed to have lost it . Days after Wilson claimed to have . lost the ticket, three public school workers including two teachers and . an administrator came forward with a winning ticket to claim their . prize. The winners, who chose to remain anonymous, each received between . $30 million and $40 million after taxes. The . lawsuit against Wilson claims that she had never lost the ticket, but . that she gave it to the public school workers in order to split the . prize money among fewer people. Workers at the McDonalds in Baltimore now say she did Wilson did have the winning ticket but gave it to the eventual winners to split the cash with fewer people . The Three Amigos who cashed the massive check have never been publicly identified . One . of the plaintiffs, Dominique Gordet, says he was Wilson's live-in . boyfriend at the time and that she confessed the elaborate scheme to . him. ‘Since that time, . defendant Wilson has repeatedly admitted that those individuals were . mere nominees, on her behalf, and that arrangements had been made to . ensure that she would later receive nearly all the lottery proceeds,’ the lawsuit states. The plaintiffs said they gave Wilson more than $75 to buy lottery tickets at a Shell gas station near the McDonald's where they worked. Denial: Wilson stands by her story that she lost the 'winning' lottery ticket and denies the lawsuit's claims. Controversy: Wilson was at the centre of a media frenzy when she claimed to have the ticket in April . ‘On information and belief, she purchased, or caused another to purchase, additional tickets, including the winning ticket at a 7-11 convenience store in Baltimore County. 'These additional tickets were purchased by virtue of additional monies being paid into the pool after the first purchase.’ News of the lawsuit was first reported by the Baltimore Sun. Maryland lottery officials say there is no evidence of fraud in the Mega Millions winnings.","Mirlande Wilson claimed to have ticket, then said she lost it and never claimed winnings .

The UKIP politician under fire for referring to ‘Bongo Bongo land’ today offered up yet another explanation for his remarks – he was talking about an antelope. Godfrey Bloom faced repeated accusations of racism after condemning foreign aid being sent to ‘Bongo Bongo land’, seen as a derogatory reference to Africa. But he insisted that a bongo is a ‘white antelope, lives in the forest, there is no connotation of racism about it whatsoever’. Critics were quick to point out that the bongo antelope is not white, it is brown. Scroll down for video . Excuses: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom insisted a 'bongo' is an antelope, so 'Bongo Bongo Land' is the home of the antelope, not a racist term . The bizarre justification for his remarks is just the latest in a long list put forward by the MEP since a recording of a speech to UKIP activists emerged this week. He was slapped on the wrist by party leaders after he was secretly recorded making what critics immediately branded racist comments. He told supporters in the Midlands that foreign leaders who received aid spent the money on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it’. In the recording, the MEP for Yorkshire . and the Humber says: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a . month when we’re in this sort of debt to Bongo Bongo land is completely . beyond me.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage ordered Mr Bloom to stop using the term and the under-fire MEP issued a carefully-worded statement apologising if he had caused ‘genuine offence’. However, in a fresh round of media interviews he again sought to explain his choice of words. He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘These have been interpreted as racist comments, they are not racist at all. ‘If anybody would care to take the trouble to get out the Oxford dictionary this morning and look it up, you’ll find that bongo is a white antelope, lives in the forest, there is no connotation of racism about it whatsoever. ‘Bongo land is the land of the antelope. ‘Some people have interpreted it as a racist remark but there is no evidence in any dictionary at all that it implies racism.’ Bongo bongo land: Mr Bloom insisted he was referring to the rare east African Mountain Bongo, seen here at Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire . There is just a few dozen of the bongo antelopes left in Kenya. They are hunted for their reddish-brown coat with white stripes, and their long spiralled horns. There are thought to be only around 100 left in the wild. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the the western or lowland bongo on the ‘near threatened’ list. In addition to the threat posed by poachers, numbers of fallen as logging wiped out their habitats. But his explanation was dismissed by Labour's foreign aid spokesman Rushanara Ali. She said: 'It’s offensive for sure and the public . have shown that they find it offensive so I think Mr Bloom should . apologise, it would do him good, it would do his party good. 'This is a . party that is trying to show that they are reasonable but his comments . are completely unacceptable and objectionable and that’s what the public . are saying. 'Nigel . Farage ought to step in and sort this out because this just shows what . his party is really about and it’s not a party that’s inclusive, it’s an . intolerant party and it’s defined by Mr Bloom. 'There . are legitimate views about how we should spend aid and so on but I . don’t think the vast majority of people accept the term bongo bongo land . - that is offensive.' The 63-year-old has spent the last 24 hours fielding questions about the comments, insisting he has the broad support of the public away from the ‘Westminster bubble’. His office has revealed 3,000 emails since the storm erupted and ‘half a dozen’ disagree with him, he claimed. Repeatedly quizzed on whether he is a . racist, Mr Bloom told Channel 4 News interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy: . ‘Move on, there’s a good fellow. If you’re not going to move on to . serious issues, I’m not going to continue – I can’t be bothered with . it.’ He then tore off his earpiece and stormed off. It . was an abrupt ending to a day of Whitehall farce as Mr Bloom engaged in . a whirlwind tour of radio and television studios, repeatedly defending . himself and making the case against overseas aid. Going: Mr Bloom starts to get annoyed during interview with Channel 4 News... Going: The MEP whips off his earpiece... Gone: And waves goodbye to interviewer . Asked by the BBC yesterday where ‘Bongo Bongo land’ was, Mr Bloom said: ‘I don’t know where Ruritania is either – there is no such place of course is there? Like the Third World. Where is the Third World?’ Later he suggested: ‘It might have been misconstrued by President Bongo of the Gambon, he may have thought I was talking about him. ‘If he is offended, I shall write to his excellency in short order and say, “I’m very sorry I wasn’t talking about you”. Ali Bongo is president of Gabon, not Gambon. David Cameron weighed into the row today, branding Mr Bloom's remarks 'offensive' and defending the use of British taxpayers' money for overseas aid. He said: 'I think it is an offensive remark anyway, but what I think is wrong is this sort of ""stop the world, I want to get off"" approach just doesn't work. Unrepentant: Mr Bloom, his wife Katryna and their terrier chippy yesterday . 'Britain is a very open international country. The problems elsewhere come and visit us. So it makes sense I think to have an overseas aid programme that helps solve these problems at source,' he told BBC Breakfast. However, Mr Bloom stood by his central argument that it was wrong to send British taxpayers’ money to foreign countries while making cuts at home. He claimed: ‘We’re closing our A&E wings of our hospitals, we’re cutting our police, we’re cutting our defence, we don’t have enough dialysis machines and we're sending £1 billion a month away without even an audit trail. ‘We don’t even know where most of it goes. It’s treason and it’s a disgrace and that’s the point I made in my speech which incidentally wasn’t clandestine recorded, it was an open meeting in Birmingham and lots of people were there - there was nothing clandestine about it.” Asked if he has been pressured to resign by the UKIP leadership, Mr Bloom replied: 'Good Lord no, not with the amount of support that I’ve had - it’s massive. 'What I have promised Nigel is I won’t use that phraseology in the future so it can’t be misinterpreted and I’m quite happy to obey that rule.' The . son of a Second World War fighter pilot, Mr Bloom – known to friends as . ‘Godders’ – grew up in London and spent 40 years working as an . economist in the City. He has been married to Katryna, a . physiotherapist who hails from Poland, for nearly 30 years. Mr Bloom . drifted into politics after being asked to write a research note on the . single currency in the mid-1990s. ‘I gave it ten years before it started to inwardly collapse,’ he recalls. ‘I’ve been proved right in spades.’ Mr Farage, then a City colleague and drinking companion, persuaded him to join the party. He was elected as an MEP in 2004. Men are from Mars and women are from Venus. Or in Godfrey Bloom's case, men are better at reversing cars while women can find condiments in the pantry and fret about wet towels left on beds. The bowler-hat wearing 63-year-old as gained a reputation for his outspoken views. His latest musings on the differences between the sexes emerged in an article railing against setting quotes for the number of women on the boards of FTSE 100 companies. Mr Bloom argued that women have a 'genetic predisposition' to prioritise family over working hard. 'Most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man, most men can reverse a car better than a woman,' he said in an article. 'Men and women care about different things on a micro-scale. Leaving the lavatory seat up, wet towels on the bed and the top left off the toothpaste will drive a wife mad. 'A man simply cannot understand what the problem is. Most wives do not regard putting petrol in the car as any part of their responsibility. 'Men cannot see the point in making the bed if you are going to get back in it tonight.' He also boasted of being 'just about as Alpha' as a man can be. 'I am not a 'new man', would not be caught dead at the birth of a baby and [would be] happy to punch the first man who tries to steal my beer,' he said in the article last month. He also lashed out at modern feminism 'spawned in the bra burning 1970s by rather shrill, bored, middleclass women of a certain physical genre'. He said they represented few women but are now supported by 'the slightly effete politically correct chaps who get sand kicked in their face on the beach'.","Godfrey Bloom confused why 'Bongo Bongo land' might be seen as racist .

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 19:52 EST, 6 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:52 EST, 6 August 2013 . The plot of the 1941 Humphrey Bogart classic The Maltese Falcon revolves around a 12-inch falcon statue which the film's protagonist believes to be a priceless antique - but in the end is revealed to be a lead fake. So it's ironic that the original film prop, an unremarkable lead falcon statue, is now expected to fetch a seven-figure sum at auction. The statue, a 50lb falcon complete with dents from when Bogart dropped it on set, has been described by movie experts as one of the most important movie props of all time, up there with Dorothy's ruby slippers or Holly Golightly's little black dress. Priceless: The worthless fake from the Bogart classic The Maltese Falcon is now expected to fetch $1.5 million at auction in November . Like a hawk: Bogart as Sam Spade contemplates the falcon statue that will be auctioned in November . Cited as the first major film noir production, the film centers around Humphrey Bogart's character Sam Spade, a private detective in San Francisco competing with three unscrupulous fly-by-nights in a quest to obtain a priceless jewel-encrusted falcon. Spade and the other characters pursuing the statue believe it's been painted black to disguise its true worth, but at the film's climax the falcon is revealed as a fake. Classic: A poster from The Maltese Falcon, Bogart's breakout film . Catherine Williams, the director of entertainment memorabilia at Bonhams auction house told the UK Times, 'This statue is the greatest film prop ever, not only because of its central role in the film but also because of what it symbolized. 'In the last scene of the film, Humphrey Bogart’s character Sam Spade . says the statue is ‘the stuff dreams are made of’ - and that summed up . cinema at the time.' The real deal: The Duke of Devonshire is in possession of the bejeweled statuette believed to be the inspiration for the Bogart film . The falcon statue itself is said to be based on the Kniphausen Hawk, a ceremonial pouring vessel made in 1697 for George William von Kniphausen, Count of the Holy Roman Empire. The real vessel is currently owned by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. Only two falcon props were ever made for the film, which was described by Roger Ebert as one of the greatest films of all time. The one being auctioned has been displayed in various museums but never been part of a private collection. The other was auctioned off in 1994 for $398,500 to a private collector. The role that the falcon in the film is an example of a 'MacGuffin', a plot device that motivates the protagonist but has little relevance to the storyline. As interest in the 50lb lead falcon heats up, a line from the film seems fitting: . 'I couldn't be fonder of you if you were my own son,' says one character to another. 'But, well, if you lose a son, it's possible to get another. There's only one Maltese Falcon.' Bonhams will auction the statue in New York in November.","The original prop from the Humphrey Bogart classic The Maltese Falcon is set to be auctioned .

A tech pioneer once worth up to a $1 billion has filed chapter 7 bankruptcy after years of ill-fated investments that proved his financial expertise don’t extend outside the realm of the internet. Halsey Minor, 48, had to first climb high to make this epic tumble. And he did so with some shrewd investments in several soon-to-be profitable ventures. The Charlottesville, Virginia native founded CNET, a television network and web brand focused on software and technology, in 1994. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Gone bust: Dotcom pioneer Halsey Minor (left) made hundreds of millions starting in the 90s, but is now filing personal bankruptcy after years of splurging on art and mansions . Minor would sell the network he founded to CBS in 2008 for a reported $1.8 billion. The tech entrepreneur had other successes as well. He was an early investor in the now-profitable OpenDNS. He also Pumped $6 million into a voice over internet startup called Grand Central that would later be purchased by Google, and turned into Google Voice, for $50 million in 2007. An early investment in Salesforce.com, a company that provides cloud computing solutions, proved fruitful after the company—now worth $25 billion—went public, earning Minor hundreds of millions. And the master of the tech investment didn’t stop investing there. He began investing in things outside his realm of expertise, a decision that prove to be his downfall. Unfinished business: Minor's planned Charlottesville, Virginia Landmark Hotel, was hatched in 2007 but sat empty at 2008, unfinished and skeletal until Minor and his investors were forced to abandon the project . A real estate investment, a Los Angeles home he paid $20 million for in 2006, was later put on the market for just over $11 million. Also in 2006, Minor lost $50 million in a divorce settlement with wife Deborah. Halsey Minor made hundreds of millions from his tech investments beginning in the early 1990s. But his trouble began after he began trying his hand at investing outside the dotcom world: . Los Angeles Mansion: Minor sold an LA mansion for $11 million in 2006 after paying $20 million for the property . Charlottesville Landmark Hotel: High hopes couldn't save this 2007 hotel project. It would eventually be wrenched from him after standing unfinished for years. A judge later ruled that Minor owed investment firm $21.6 million according to court filings . Carter's Grove Estate: Minor bought the historic James River Estate for $35 million in 2007. It subsequently stood empty and in disrepair for years until preservationists successfully got the crumbling mansion placed at auction in 2013. Le Petit Trianon: A replica of living quarters at the palace of Versailles in France, Minor also bought the $21 million San Francisco mansion in 2007, but neither he nor his family ever occupied it. Reports say the city deemed the property 'abandoned' in 2011 and placed it up for auction at $25M . Sotheby's: Minor also fancied fine art, it seems, as the Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses took action against him in 2007, claiming he failed to make good on winning bids on several high-end paintings, including: Edward Hick's 'Peaceable Kingdom,' Hassam's 'Paris, Winter Day' and Warhol's 'Diamond Dust Shoes' The following year, 2007, the investor made several purchases he’d later live to regret. In his native Charlottesville, Minor became a major investor, through his company Minor Family Hotels, in the ultimately failed development of the downtown Landmark Hotel project. The nine-story building, designed to have 100 rooms, sat empty and unfinished for years after its initial construction. Taxes and fines accrued as what was once a symbol of optimism in downtown Charlottesville remained just a sad skeleton. The unfinished hotel was finally auctioned off last year for $6.25 million, though it continues to sit untouched and a scourge to the community, waiting for its new owners to resume construction. Also in Virginia, an equally contentiousness investment by Minor sits along the James River. The historic Carter’s Grove estate, completed in 1755 is referred by the National Parks Service as ‘one of colonial America’s most impressive examples of Georgian architecture.’ Minor struck a deal for the home he reportedly said ‘I have no use for’ in 2007. But, by 2011, he’d missed two payments on the estate and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Meanwhile, preservationist became increasingly agitated by what they called Minor’s neglect of the estate as it began to fall into disrepair due to lack of upkeep. Over in San Francisco, Minor’s 2007 $22 million purchase of a replica Versailles mansion in the city’s posh Presidio Heights also ended in heartache. Minor had big intentions of restoring the local and national landmark to its original grandeur, but the proposed $15 million revamp never came to be. The city of San Francisco would site the 22-room building as abandoned, due to its state of disrepair, by 2011. Artless: Minor purchased Edward Hicks 'The Peaceable Kingdom with the Leopard of Serenity' at auction, along with two other pieces, that he reported never paid for and auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's then sued . Diamond-eyed: Minor initially bid for and won Warhol's 'Diamond Dust Shoes' from Sotheby's auction house but later backed out and Sotheby's sued . Dismal days: Minor also refused to pay for Hassam's 'Paris, Winter Day' That same year, the mansion that Minor at no point occupied, would be put up for auction at $25 million. After his 2011 bankruptcy claim, Minor’s assets were frozen. Carter’s Grove was offered as security to Sotheby’s, to which he owned several million more for well-known fine art pieces he’d neglected to fully pay for after winning them at auction. Specifically, Edward Hicks 'Peaceable Kingdom with the Leopard of Serenity,’ Childe Hassam’s ‘Paris, Winter Day,’ and Andy Warhol’s ‘Diamond Dust Shoes.’ Damaged goods: Minor purchased a James River plantation, Carter Grove, for $13.7M, just before his assets were frozen from a 2011 bankruptcy. The historic property quickly fell into disrepair . var p = new anv_pl_def();p.loadVideoWithKey(""eyJtIjoiR1JUViIsInAiOiI0MiIsInYiOiIyNjA5ODE1In0=""); . Minor has since filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and cites liabilities of $50 million to $100 million to 60 creditors, while claiming personal assets of between $10 million and $50 million. 'I love being an entrepreneur even though it involves financial risk,' Minor wrote in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. 'I have been fortunate enough to play a meaningful role in building great companies like CNET Networks, Salesforce.com, Rhapsody, NBCi, the service known as Google Voice and others. But if you win some you are going to lose some too.' Le mistake: Also in 2007, Minor bought a replica of a Versailles palace living quarters in San Francisco for $22M . Wasted space: Le Petit Trianon was never occupied by Minor and, like the Virginia estate, fell into disrepair. Skateboarders were found using its staircases as ramps. The city deemed the home 'abandoned' in 2011 and it was placed at auction . The Wall Street Journal reports Minor’s creditors include Allied Waste Services, Allied Waste Services, AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Bank of America Home Loans, the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Dominion Virginia Power, the Internal Revenue Service, tax collector offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, various law firms and UCLA Medical Center, among others. A trustee will now be appointed to Minor to liquidate his remaining assets in order to repay his many creditors. Minor setback: Minor sold this lavishly modern LA mansion in 2006 for a reported $11 million but paid $20 million for the unique property . Liquidated: Minor filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy Friday, the most common type of personal bankruptcy.

Private detectives hired by an insurance company filmed a seven-year-old girl getting undressed on a beach during an investigation of her disabled mother’s compensation claim. Joanna Hill, a marketing executive and mother-of-four was left in a wheelchair and in constant pain after her leg was crushed in a car accident seven years ago. Lawyers for Churchill hired a surveillance firm to check whether her injuries were as bad as suggested. The firm, the Cotswold Group, secretly filmed not only her but her friends and children, including when the youngsters were in the grounds of their private school, a Sunday newspaper reported. This image from the surveillance footage shows Joanna Hill and her seven-year-old daughter Felicity . On one occasion, her seven-year-old daughter Felicity was filmed changing out of her swimsuit on West Wittering beach, West Sussex, during a family holiday. The footage was obtained by Mrs Hill and her husband Gavin, 43, an insurance actuary who works in the City, during court disclosure. The revelations will raise further concerns about practices within the private eye industry. It has faced scrutiny amid concerns over the so-called ‘blue-chip hacking scandal’ in which it emerged more than 100 companies including law firms and insurers hired private eyes who broke the law. Last week the Daily Mail revealed millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money was being spent on private investigators by councils and other public bodies. There is no suggestion the Cotswold Group – now G4S Investigation Solutions – have behaved unlawfully. But Mrs Hill, 43, is furious at the use of covert techniques to film her family. She fears tracking devices may have been fitted to the family car to help the investigators follow them. She told The Sunday Times: ‘We were disgusted when we found out they had filmed the children. The children were upset and for a long time afterwards they were very nervous about changing on the beach. They are still very self-conscious and worried about being followed and filmed. It’s devastating once you know people are snooping.’ The filming prompted a complaint to Royal Bank of Scotland Insurance, the then owner of Churchill. In it the family complained about the ‘appalling and unfair treatment which we have experienced at the hands of RBSI’. Paul Geddes, then chief executive of RBSI, said the company had carried out an investigation and was sorry the couple felt they had been badly treated. But he pointed out that Mrs Hill agreed a settlement – thought to be about £2million. The Hills said they were forced to settle rather than face the huge costs of taking the case to court for a larger amount of money. A spokesman for Churchill, now owned by Direct Line, said: ‘In common with other insurers, we occasionally use professional surveillance experts to help with evidence-gathering to test the veracity of claims. ‘Exaggerated or fraudulent claims cost the insurance industry in excess of £1billion in 2012.’ The case is now being examined by civil rights group Liberty. Its director Shami Chakrabarti said: . ‘Creepy seaside snooping on children is the risk we run when respect for personal privacy and human dignity goes out the window.’ G4S, which took over Cotswold in 2011, said: ‘As this incident occurred before G4S took control of the company we are not in a position to comment, other than to confirm we are confident all our operatives now follow the highest standards.’ Joanna Hill said she was 'disgusted' when she found out her children had been followed by insurance private investigators checking up on her multi-million pound claim following a car crash (file picture) Seven-year-old Felicity was filmed changing at West Wittering beach in Sussex (pictured)","Joanna Hill said she was 'disgusted' when she learned of surveillance .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 22:26 EST, 27 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:28 EST, 27 June 2013 . For years a blurry picture of a woman posing with a parasol was believed to be Mary Bowser, the slave turned Union spy during the civil war. But after several years of researching the elusive spy, who worked undercover as a slave in the Confederate White House, a historian and novelist has revealed the truth behind the picture. As Lois Leveen researched her historical novel The Secrets of Mary Bowser, she was intrigued by the only image said to be of the Union spy. Mystery: For years this picture of a woman named Mary Bowser was believed to be of a Union spy . Few details are known about the African American woman, who was freed by the Van Lew family in Richmond, Virginia, who sent her to the North to be educated. The Civil War era diary of the Union spy Elizabeth Van Lew recalls how an African American named Mary had been a vital source of information. About 50 years after the war, which ran between 1861 and 1865, Van Lew's niece identified the woman as Bowser. 'Mary was exceptionally intelligent, and displayed some acting skills,' according to The Guardian Express. 'Hoping to gain access to secret information, she became “Ellen Bond”, a dim-witted, crazy, but very able servant.' Because slaves were assumed to be illiterate and background characters, Bowser was able to listen in on vital conversations by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his men. As she cleaned meeting rooms she was also able to examine documents and pass on details to the Van Lew family. Clues: The original photograph was found to have been taken about 40 years after the Civil War . Misleading: The woman in the photograph was named Mary Bowser, but the picture was not of the spy . The first time a picture of Bowser was linked to her stories of espionage was in 2002, when a radio station's website ran the photo, crediting it to 'James A. Chambers, U.S. Army Deputy, Office of the Chief, Military Intelligence'. But, as Leveen researched her book she became suspicious of the authenticity of the picture. 'My doubts about the image grew when I . unearthed several post-war sources corroborating Bowser's participation . in the Richmond espionage ring,' she told The Atlantic. 'One of these documents indicates that in . June of 1867, the slave-turned-spy, then using the surname Garvin, left . the U.S. for the West Indies; after that date, she disappears from the . historical record.' Leveen added that the dress and furniture in the photograph appeared to be from a later era. She finally traced the original picture to the Library of Virginia, where the origins of the photograph were stated as Petersburg Studio C. R. Rees. Rees began taken the cabinet style of picture, like the one said to be of Mary Bowser, in 1860, but did not open a studio in Pertersburg, Virginia, until 1880, making it unlikely that the woman in the photo was the spy. A few months later, Leveen was given the chance to view the original, which would finally confirm if the picture was of the spy. 'This is the moment a historian lives for - cradling a rare primary source in hand. And it was just as informative as I'd hoped,' Leveen said. Historical fact: Lois Leveen tracked down the truth behind the picture after writing about Mary Bowser's life . The back of the cabinet card captioned the photograph as Mary Bowser, and the name was repeated on the address on the back. But, the date of the photograph was 1900, when Bowser would have been about 60. Leveen pointed out that whoever cropped the original photograph, when it started circulating on the internet as being the spy, had removed the critical date proving it was of the wrong person. She added that the lack of a picture of Bowser was a valuable insight into American history. 'Americans of all backgrounds contributed to our history. But the enormous holes in what we have of [Bowser's] biography remind us that gender, race, and class also shaped how millions of Americans went unrecorded,' she said. Missing: Lois Leveen says the lack of a photograph is a reminder of how slaves were written out of history . 'Wanting to commemorate an African American woman who played such a dramatic part in the Civil War is laudable. Expecting to have a photograph of her was borderline ludicrous.' In 1995 the government honored Bowser's efforts by inducting her in the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Corps hall of fame. Her efforts were described as: 'a highly dangerous mission to the great benefit of the Union effort. She was one of the highest placed and most productive espionage agents of the Civil War. … Jefferson Davis never discovered the leak in his household staff, although he knew the Union somehow kept discovering Confederate plans.'","Mary Bowser pretended to be a slave to get close to Confederate president .

"By . Claire Donnelly . PUBLISHED: . 15:37 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:15 EST, 7 August 2013 . My five-year-old son Stanley sat beside me in the dentist's waiting room, his little hand clutching mine as he tried his best to be brave. But a few minutes later, I was the one choking back tears as the dentist injected Stanley's mouth with anaesthetic and tugged a rotten molar from his gums. I was filled with a terrible sense of shame. He wouldn't be suffering if I had taken better care of his teeth. I'd assumed that regular tooth-brushing and a healthy, low-sugar diet would be enough. To my shock, it wasn't. A combination of lazy brushing and one too many treats was most likely to blame. My only comfort is that I'm not the only parent in this situation. Claire Donnelly, 39, with her son Stanley Sheridan, 5, at her home in Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire . Stanley had to have one of his teeth removed as he hadn't brushed his teeth properly . The most recent NHS figures reveal that tooth decay in under-fives is a major problem, with more than one million pre-schoolers and reception class pupils having at least two fillings. Each year, 30,000 children end up being admitted to hospital because of rotten teeth. Many have five or six taken out at once; some their entire set of baby teeth. Perhaps it's hardly surprising, given that 2 per cent of mums say their children don't brush their teeth at all, and 6 per cent of UK children never have dental check-ups. Dentists call these juvenile patients 'Ribena babies' - children whose teeth have been damaged by soft drinks containing sugar, one of which is Ribena, and other sweet fare. I'd assumed they had ill-educated parents, so was mortified to discover Stan was one of them. He and his six-year-old brother Frank are banned from fizzy drinks, and have squash, fruit juice or sparkling water. They eat porridge rather than sugary processed cereals. Biscuits, cakes, chocolates and sugary drinks are not allowed in their school playground. They have always brushed their teeth twice a day, morning and evening, and I've spent a small fortune on Spider-Man toothbrushes and novelty toothpastes to make the experience fun. Claire felt dreadful when she had to hold Stanley's hand at the dentist and watch his tooth being removed, knowing she was responsible . Yet when the dentist prodded one of Stanley's bottom teeth, he squealed with pain. There was a hole in his tooth, which would have to be extracted, and he was given antibiotics for a gum infection. The dentist said I should keep a closer eye on how they brush and how long for. I was also told to ditch the 'fun' toothpastes for one with the same fluoride content advised for adults - 1,350 to 1,500 parts per million. At home, I sat down and made a note of how many snacks and treats they eat in a week - and  I realised I'd been deluding myself. They were eating a lot of sugar. As well as natural sugars in apples, bananas and rice cakes, there were after-school pastries, sweets from grandma, boxes of raisins and iced lollies on a trip to the park. And the crumble, custard and flapjacks, which I'd convinced myself were healthy because they were home-made. To my sons' horror, I've stopped all after-school sweet treats. But when I think of Stanley cowering in the dentist's chair, I know I'm doing what's right for my children.","Claire Donnelly's son Stan, 5, had to have a tooth removed by dentist .

"By . Meghan Keneally and Nina Golgowski . PUBLISHED: . 20:05 EST, 21 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:50 EST, 21 July 2012 . One day after accusations that the U.S. government has been infiltrated by the Muslim Brotherhood leading to heavy criticism of Rep Michele Bachmann in both political parties, she's not backing down. Instead, the former presidential candidate has added a fellow congressman to her list of U.S. suspects she believes needs investigating. Rep Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to congress and whom Bachmann shares the state of Minnesota with, has been added to her list of names. Scroll down for video . Taking names: One day after Rep Michele Bachmann accused the U.S. government of being infiltrated by the Muslim Brotherhood she has added Rep Keith Ellison (right) , a Muslim who challenged her views, to her list . Ellison was added following his defense of Secretary of State . Hillary Clinton's top aid Huma Abedin, a Muslim, whom Bachmann accused of having relations to the Islamic society. He said she should apologize to Ms Abedin for her accusations, coupled with four other Republicans, that had zero merit. Responding to that request, Bachmann voiced concern of Ellison . as well and suggested he be added to the list also. 'He has a long record of being associated with (the Council . on American-Islamic Relations) and with the Muslim Brotherhood,' she told radio . and TV host Glenn Beck on Thursday night. Ellison, addressing Bachmann's curt accusation, said it is . false and believes the congresswoman who's currently running for re-election . just wants attention. Questioned: Huma Abedin (left), aide to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (right), has been subjected to inquiry by Rep Michele Bachmann and four other fellow House Republicans for having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood . What rights: Rep Bachmann questioned the high security clearance Ms Abedin has working for Secretary Clinton which Rep Ellison chastised the congresswoman for . 'I think she thinks that we're evil because we don't . understand God the way she does,' Mr Ellison told the Huffington Post. 'It must . be very frightening to see the world through her eyes.' It . was only Wednesday the typically press shy Ms Abedin made headlines . instead of her husband, disgraced former New York Congressman Anthony . Weiner. First, she and Weiner appeared in a People magazine spread where she declared that she is proud to be married to her husband even after the Twitter sexting scandal that forced him to resign his position as a Democratic representative for part of the Queens borough in New York. Then she was a hot topic by Bachmann and other Republican politicians deriding her with claims that her deceased father, mother, and brother  has connections to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. Calling her out: Though John McCain (right) never mentioned her explicitly, he gave a seven-minute speech slamming a letter that Michele Bachmann (left) wrote deriding one of Hillary Clinton's top aides . 'The concerns about the foreign . influence of immediate family members is such a concern to the U.S. Government that it includes these factors as potentially disqualifying . conditions for obtaining a security clearance, which undoubtedly Ms . Abedin has had to obtain to function in her position,' Ms Bachmann wrote . in a responding letter to Mr Ellison who called her claims baseless. '...in questioning how Ms Abedin . received a high-level security clearance, you imply that our top . intelligence agencies did not adequately investigate Ms Abedin,' Ellison . responded. 'Accusing the . men and women of the U.S. intelligence community of failing to do their . jobs requires far more substantial information than what you have . provided to date,' he wrote. Trusted: Bachmann says Ms Abedin's position is highly sensitive and she could abuse it, effectively because of falsified rumors about her Muslim family's connections . Republican Arizona Senator John McCain, like Ellison, also came to Ms Abedin's defense. The former presidential candidate spoke . passionately about Ms Abedin’s years of dedicated public service in her . role with Secretary Clinton, and denounced the senseless character . attacks that were made by some of his more conservative party members. 'Huma represents what is best about America: the daughter of immigrants, who has risen to the highest levels of our government on the basis of her substantial personal merit and her abiding commitment to the American ideals that she embodies so fully.' McCain said in his speech on the Senate floor. 'I am proud to know Huma, and to call her my friend.' Bachmann, who rose to national prominence during her failed bid for position of this year’s Republican presidential candidate, alleged that Ms Abedin’s deceased father, mother, and brother are connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, the controversial political opposition group who often works against American interest in Arab states. Touting her role on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Bachmann wrote a letter- which was co-signed by four other congressmen- alleging that given Ms Abedin’s highly-sensitive position in Ms Clinton’s staff, she is effectively a national security threat due to her fictitious connections to the Brotherhood. In the letter, which was sent to the deputy inspector general of the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence among others, Mrs Bachmann and her co-signers gave no traces of evidence of their findings. Stay at home dad: Weiner has been taking care of his new son Jordan while his wife Huma Abedin continues her high-powered job at Hillary Clinton's top aide . Well connected: Ms Abedin has stood quietly by her husband Anthony Weiner in the wake of his sexting scandal last year that lead to his resignation . Mr McCain made a clear attack on the . statements, drawing on his own personal experience having been the . victim of false rumors during his multiple presidential campaigns, and . having his heroism questioned in spite of his strong military record . which included many years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. He said that he knows the pain that is cause 'when a person's character, reputation and patriotism are attacked.' 'When anyone, not least a member of Congress, launches specious and degrading attacks against fellow Americans on the basis of nothing more than fear of who they are and ignorance of what they stand for, it defames the spirit of our nation, and we all grow poorer because of it,' he said. ‘To say that the accusations made in both documents are not substantiated by the evidence they offer is to be overly polite and diplomatic about it. In the shadows: A then-pregnant Abedin (left in both shots) was the one to hand Clinton her Blackberry when the news came through that Muammar Gaddafi had been killed . Defender: John McCain dismissed the letter about Abedin as reckless and said that he was honored to call her a friend . ‘The letter in the report offer not one . instance of an action, a decision or a public position that Huma has . taken while at the State Department or as a member of then-Senator . Clinton's staff that would lend credence to the charge that she is . promoting anti-American activities within our government.’ Mrs Clinton’s staff clearly appreciated the bi-lateral support that he showed in renouncing the move. Mrs Clinton’s spokesman Philippe Reines dismissed the accusations, calling them 'nothing but vicious and disgusting lies, and anyone who traffics in them should be ashamed of themselves. I would hope that hearing the remarkable statement from someone of Senator McCain's stature gives her (Bachmann) pause in doing so any further.' In response, Mrs Bachmann said that her words were being twisted and that the point of her letters was 'to outline the serious national security concerns I had and ask for answers to questions regarding the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical group's access to top Obama administration officials.'

"By . Charlotte Dovey . PUBLISHED: . 03:13 EST, 20 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:29 EST, 20 August 2013 . Dianne Woodford, from Beverley, East Yorkshire . As a nurse, you'd think Dianne Woodford was better placed than most to spot any illness she might be suffering. She had, after all, been trained to pick up on even those barely visible signs that most of us would dismiss as minor. But five years ago - when she was 38 - she discovered she was as vulnerable as the rest of us. For on August 22, Dianne was struck down with bacterial meningitis, the more severe form of the infection that can damage the nerves and brain. Worse still, she dismissed one of the standard symptoms of the disease - a dislike of bright lights - thinking it was just a headache. But the disease cost the mother of three her sight. 'I remember getting home at lunchtime with a throbbing pain in my temple and thinking I just needed a quick sleep to get over it. I'd felt pretty shabby all morning and thought I was coming down with the flu,' says Dianne who lives in Beverley, East Yorkshire, and has three children: Ella, 21, Joe, 19, and Jamie, eight. She and her husband separated seven years ago. 'Jamie was just a toddler at the time so I put him to sleep and took a couple of painkillers. I lay on the sofa, and asked Ella to wake me up as soon as Jamie stirred.' But to her daughter's horror, when she went to wake her mum a few hours later, she was unconscious. 'It was hideous for Ella,' says Dianne. 'She ran out to get one of our neighbours, who rang for an ambulance. The paramedics administered antibiotics immediately, then took me to Hull Royal Infirmary. But I don't remember any of it - I was in a coma for the next 24 hours.' After a brain scan and lumbar function test (where the spinal fluid is tested to confirm suspected meningitis), doctors did  all they could to fight the infection in Dianne's body and bring down the inflammation of her brain. Fortunately, seven hours after arriving at the hospital, Dianne started to show signs of improvement. To everyone's relief, 24 hours after her arrival she regained full consciousness. But this good news was clouded instantly. 'When I came to the next morning, I felt absolutely awful - very tired and mentally foggy - but the real problem was when I opened my eyes: everything stayed blurry.' Dianne told the nurses, who immediately alerted the doctors. They suspected the meningitis infection might have affected her  eyes, but assured her that her  sight should improve within a few days. The number of different types of bacteria linked to meningitis and septicaemia . However, after a detailed examination of her eyes the next day they realised the damage was worse than they thought. Doctors told Dianne the bacteria had lodged in the delicate blood vessels that supply the retina - the layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. The immune system had tried to clear the infection, but this had triggered inflammation and bleeding, which had permanently damaged the cells in the retina. Doctors said they would operate to try to stop any further bleeding, but the chances of her vision returning to normal were minimal. 'It was shocking news to take in,' says Dianne. 'The last thing I remember, after all, was going for a quick nap on my sofa. 'I racked my brain as to how the hell I could have caught it - if I'd been in contact with anyone who could have had it - but there were no answers. 'On the face of it, I tried to be strong, particularly when my children visited me. But I'd be lying if I said that there weren't dark times. This wasn't the future I wanted.' Despite 12 operations, doctors were unable to save Dianne's sight. She is blind in her right eye and has only 5 per cent vision in her left, enabling her to see light and shade, but no depth perception. She is registered blind and relies on a guide dog. One in four people suffer after-effects including hearing loss and kidney failure. Sight is affected in one in 20 . Adult meningitis is far more prevalent than many people think. 'While most meningitis publicity is aimed at catching the disease early in children, around one-third of cases every year - about 1,500 people - involve those over the age of 18,' says Robert Read, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Southampton. Catherine Fougere-Masters, from the charity Meningitis UK, adds: 'What people don't realise is that in adults, catching the disease early is even more important because the after-effects tend to be far more severe.' Around one in four people struck by the disease suffer long-term after-effects, including hearing loss, neurological complications (such as epilepsy, concentration and memory problems), amputations and kidney failure. Sight is affected in one in 20. The bacteria that trigger the infection often live harmlessly in the nose and throat. Indeed, approximately 10 per cent of us carry these bacteria in this way at any one time (compared with up to 30 per cent of those aged between 14 and 24). The bacteria becomes dangerous only when it moves from the nose and throat into the bloodstream (why this happens in some people is not clear). You can catch it from someone else through inhaling infected droplets after they've coughed or sneezed or via saliva (through kissing), says Ms Fougere- Masters. However, as the bacteria aren't transferred as easily as the viruses that cause colds or flu, prolonged or close contact is usually required. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria can travel to the lining of the brain (the meninges) and cause infection and inflammation; this can occur within just a matter of hours. In particularly bad cases, septicaemia, also known as blood poisoning, occurs when the bacteria multiply in the blood and release damaging toxins. But it's when the initial symptoms - such as fever, headache, lethargy and joint and muscle pain - start to show that the differences between child and adult cases become apparent. 'If a child or baby suffers from,  say, a fever, mothers and, indeed, paediatricians are so alert  to a possible problem that alarm bells start ringing,' says Professor Read. 'This is even more the case if the disease moves up a gear and the headache becomes severe and a stiff neck or dislike of bright lights develops. 'But in adults it's generally the complete opposite. 'Being adults, they tend to dismiss any symptoms, thinking it's flu or something that can be cured by a couple of paracetamol and a good night's sleep. Even if they do take themselves off to the doctor, symptoms are often so generic that it can easily be attributed to something far less serious.' A year after her illness, Dianne set up a charity, VisAbility, for others in the same predicament . But the sooner it's treated, says Professor Read, the less likely there are to be serious complications. 'The adult immune system tends to react far more aggressively to the infection. It's thought this occurs because adults tolerate larger numbers of bacteria in the bloodstream before their immune system kicks in. And when it does, the response is very powerful. 'This leads to the release of chemicals called cytokines which, though they help cells of the immune system ""talk"" to each other, also have the side-effect of producing general inflammation in critical parts of the body, such as the brain as well as blood vessels throughout the body.' Dianne says: 'Part of me was angry that I could probably have stopped this from happening in the first place. 'In retrospect, I knew things weren't quite right that lunchtime - I even had the stereotypical meningitis symptom of not being able to look into the light - but I just didn't do anything about it.' Though Dianne was determined for things to be normal for her children, it was difficult. 'They couldn't leave things lying around on the floor, for instance, in case I tripped. 'And though I didn't want to at first, I eventually put a bell on Jamie's jumper, like a dog, which I hated doing. 'But he was just a toddler at the time and it was the only way I could be sure of where he was.'Hardest of all was the loneliness, she says. 'There was such a feeling of isolation, of going through it on my own. 'I could no longer work, couldn't drive and knew no other visually-impaired people. As a result, I remained stuck in the house, aged 38, wondering how the hell I was going to cope.' A year after her illness, Dianne decided that there must be others in the same predicament and set up a charity, VisAbility, giving the visually impaired a chance to not only meet others of the same age, but also get out and enjoy a host of activities with like-minded people, including archery, sailing, rifle-shooting and art classes. Four years later the charity is going from strength to strength. 'It's been a long old haul,' says Dianne. 'Life is very different - sometimes extremely challenging - but at least I feel I have a life, which I didn't necessarily have at the beginning. 'And a huge part of that is down to running the charity. It helps make some sort of sense of my sight loss.'

Two Jessops stores will open today in London's Oxford Street and Birmingham, with four others opening over the Easter weekend in Manchester, Aberdeen, High Wycombe and St Albans. Up to 30 more Jessops stores are due to re-open in April, as part of a £5 million investment. Scroll down for video .

Jessops called in administrators PwC in January, leading to the closure of all 187 Jessops stores and the loss of almost 1,500 jobs. Later that month Mr Jones and other investors bought the brand and certain assets. The entrepreneur is the sole owner of the relaunched camera store chain. The company has pledged to create 500 jobs with its relaunch - with the majority going to former Jessops staff who lost their jobs when the chain collapsed. Mr Jones, who appears as an investor on the BBC reality TV series about entrepreneurs, will take the role of chief executive and chairman. He said: 'I believe Jessops is an iconic British brand which can lead the retail resurgence on Britain's high streets, powered by new innovations and world-leading, expert staff. 'Image is everything, and even in the mobile and tablet era, there's no substitute for a quality camera when it comes to taking the perfect picture.'

Hands-on: The relaunched company is forecasting sales of at least £80 million in its first year . At its appointment, PwC said the company's core market had seen a 'significant decline' in 2012, while forecast profits over Christmas did not materialise, squeezing its funding. Jessops had struggled since 2007, when it underwent a major overhaul with a swathe of store closures. The firm began life in 1935 when Frank Jessop opened his first shop in Leicester. Writing in The Sun today, Mr Jones said while 'so-called experts' say the High Street no future, he believes 'the facts say otherwise'. 'Devastating effect': Staff from the Warrington branch of Jessops plastered their photos in the window of the store in the hope of finding new employment after its closure was announced . Mr Jones said shopper numbers on the High Street were up by 2.7 per cent last month compared to the previous year, according to the British Retail Consortium. He said while the business could have been relaunched online, he knew there was a desire for a 'proper shopping experience'. He said: 'I also think it's time we snapped out of our negativity about the economy, and got behind the great British brands and institutions that can lead the recovery. 'That's why I've declared myself ""in"" to what I think will be the first step in the revival of our high streets.' He added things were looking up for British shoppers, with Blockbuster also set to re-open in the near future. The High Street has seen some turbulent times in recent years, but the latest development could be a sign of changing fortunes.

Reinforcements: Staff from bungling firm G4S are believed to have been hired to help detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile (pictured) sex scandal . The company behind a security debacle at last summer's London Olympics is believed to have been drafted in to help detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal. G4S, the firm that could only partly fulfill its contract to supply security guards at the Games, will reportedly make £250,000 to hire staff to assist police dealing with 'unprecedented workloads' as a result of Operation Yewtree. Around 20 extra staff are said to be starting 'imminently' to help with the inquiry. Reed Specialist Recruitment are believed to be recruiting retired detectives from the G4S Policing Solutions arm. One of Jimmy Savile's victims, Deborah Cogger, told The Sun that she is furious at the decision to hire G4S staff. She said: 'What will people G4S hire know about child abuse and paedophilia? 'What qualifications do they have to handle sensitive material?' Ex Met Police commander John O'Connor also branded the move 'appalling'. A statement issued by the Metropolitan Police said: 'We can confirm SC&O5 are to take on a number of external individuals via Reed Specialist Recruitment to assist with a wide range of work across the command. 'This is in line with the policy of the organisation whereby we may call upon the experience of appropriate external parties to assist with cases where unique and specialist knowledge can enhance the investigation. 'Individuals are selected by the employment agency Reed Specialist Recruitment who hold the contract for the supply of all temporary agency workers. 'Due to the unprecedented current workloads of the command created as a result of the Jimmy Saville inquiry, there is a need to take on additional staff. ' According to the Met, the hired staff will be undertaking a variety of roles and will be security checked before being put forward for roles. There are currently 30 police officers working in the SC&O5 unit working on Operation Yewtree. G4S hit the headlines after failing to fulfill its £240million contract with Locog to provide 10,400 security guards at the Olympic Park and other venues. Reinforcements: The Government had to draft in additional security helpers from the Armed Forces after G4S failed to fulfill its contract for the Olympic Games . Ready for action: An extra 1,200 troops had to be put on standby during the London Games last summer . The company's failure forced the Government to draft in members of the Armed Forces to help cover gaps. Both chief Operating Officer David Taylor-Smith and head of global events Ian Horseman Sewell resigned in the wake of the shambles. G4S is said to have made a loss of around £70million as a result of the fiasco. A G4S spokesman said: 'The 29,000 candidates on our books are mostly retired, police officers or professionals, with extensive experience of working in investigations. 'They are not employed by G4S; do not report to us; and G4S has no say over their duties, performance or continued employment. 'Candidates are recruited by police forces for their skills and experience. They are not serving police officers and have no police powers. 'They work in support of the police and will always act under the direction of a senior police officer.' The firm faced another humiliation on Wednesday when it lost its contract to provide guards for a major music festival. Loss: The company was reportedly at a loss of around £70million following the Olympics security debacle . It is the first time in 17 years the security group has not won its bid to work at the annual two-day V Festival in Staffordshire. The weekend, which this year features Beyonce, pictured, sees 85,000 revellers flock to Stafford for two days of rock music, mud and sunshine. Although G4S said that they were 'disappointed' to lose the contract, they insisted that it had nothing to do with the Olympics fiasco. Reed Specialist Recruitment were unavailable for comment.

Bernhard Goetz, the controversial 'Subway Vigilante' who shot four teenagers on the New York subway in 1984, has been charged with misdemeanor sale and possession of marijuana, authorities said Saturday. The 65-year-old was arraigned Saturday in Manhattan Criminal Court on three misdemeanor drug charges for sale and possession of marijuana. He was released on his own recognizance and is due back in court next month. Goetz became a public figure after he shot four black youths he claimed were going to mug him, prompting debate over race relations and frustration with high crime rates of New York in the 1980s. Charged: Bernard Goetz stands with attorney Danielle Iredale, as he is arraigned in Manhattan criminal court, in New York . Out and about: Bernie Goetz seen on the streets of Manhattan in February 2012. It has been reported that he was arrested for trying to make a pot deal with an undercover cop on Friday . Goetz was nabbed in a sting operation in . Union Square park Friday evening for selling $30 worth of marijuana to . an undercover officer, police said. He asked the woman if she wanted to get . high, then went back to his apartment, where he has lived for decades, . and returned with marijuana, authorities said. He was arrested on . charges of criminal sale of marijuana. According to The Post, Goetz was arrested on the street at about 5.45pm after getting into conversation with the police officer. A police source said: 'He told her he wanted to get high with her and sold her a small amount of pot in a tissue.' Courting controversy: Bernhard Goetz leaves Manhattan criminal court in New York on Saturday . Goetz wasn't being targeted specifically; he just happened to cross paths with the undercover officer assigned to crack down on drug dealing in the park, authorities said. After a tumultuous trial in 1985 that attracted much media attention, Goetz was only found guilty of criminal possession of a weapon and innocent of all four counts of attempted murder and assault. With New York in the grip of a violent crime epidemic, some hailed Goetz for standing up to his potential attackers. Others saw him as a racist, who had overstepped the boundaries of self-defense. Goetz ended up serving eight months in jail, but his legacy lasted much longer than his time in the big house. He went on to become an activist for a tougher focus on crime, and he proceeded to run for mayor of the city in 2001 and the city's public advocate in 2005. Scene: Goetz shot four black youths he claimed were going to rob him on the subway in December 1984. With New York in the grip of a violent crime epidemic, some hailed Goetz for standing up to his potential attackers. Others saw him as a racist, who had overstepped the boundaries of self-defense . Neither bid was successful, but Goetz traded in on his given nickname by opening an repair store called Vigilante Electronics. His case came back up in the press in December 2011 when one of the four men he shot killed himself in an apparent suicidal drug overdose on the 27th anniversary of the attack. James Ramseur was found dead in the Paradise Motor Inn in the Bronx. Ramseur was the youngest of four teens who surrounded Goetz on the 2 train on December 22, 1984. Believing the group was about to rob him, Goetz pulled out a .38 calibre revolver and fired, striking each of them once. Ramseur was shot in the chest, but survived. The other teenagers - Barry Allen, Troy Canty and Darrell Cabey - were also hospitalized and were not killed. Cabey was left paralyzed by the bullet that struck him. Controversial: Goetz was a divisive figure but was only found guilty of criminal possession of a weapon and innocent of all four counts of attempted murder and assault . Goetz was briefly a fugitive, but turned himself in to police a little more than a week later in Concord, New Hampshire. Goetz claimed it was self-defense, alleging the youths intended to rob him. During the trial, Ramseur testified that they were panhandling, and not demanding money from Goetz, but it was later reported that the group was intending to mug him. Goetz was convicted of a gun charge but acquitted of attempted murder. Three of the suspects were found to have screwdrivers at the time of the shooting, which the suspects claimed were used to break into arcade games to steal quarters, not as weapons. Goetz filed for bankruptcy shortly after Cabey won a $43 million lawsuit against him. Cabey's attorney, Ron Kuby, said Saturday his client remains paralyzed in a wheelchair and has never received a penny from Goetz.","Bernhard Goetz, 65, was arrested for trying to sell marijuana to an undercover police officer Friday .

Gutheridge was in critical condition on Friday at Upstate University Hospital, where he was in the intensive care unit with fractures and internal injuries, Connellan said. A phone listing for him couldn't be found, and it wasn't clear whether he had a lawyer. Police said Gutheridge fled on foot with an undisclosed amount of cash after robbing the bank.

Britain is in the grip of a buy-to-let boom with a record number of ‘landlords loans’ worth an all-time high of more than £160billion, official figures revealed yesterday. The figures, from the Council of Mortgage Lenders, showed there are 1.42 million buy-to-let mortgages, compared to just 89,000 a decade ago. Experts said landlords are cashing in on the fact that a generation of young people are frozen off the housing ladder by the crippling cost of buying a home. Market: Experts said landlords are cashing in on the fact that a generation of young people are frozen off the housing ladder by the crippling cost of buying a home . With millions of young people unable . to buy their own home, they have no choice but to rent at an age when . they would much prefer to be in their own property. The average rent has jumped by 4.3 per cent in the last year to £718 per calendar month. This is just £2 below an all-time record, according to the lettings giant LSL Property Services. In London – where it has hit a record – the average monthly rent is £1,047. A . report, which will be published today [fri], highlights how rents are . rising in Britain because ‘many would-be buyers continue to find . themselves locked out of the sales market.’ Over . the last year, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said rents . have jumped by 4.3 per cent, a much bigger jump than most people’s pay . rises. Many public sector workers are subject to a two-year pay freeze, and the average pay rise in the private sector is three per cent, according to the pay experts Incomes Data Services. Peter Bolton King, global residential director of RICS, said: ‘Rents have grown steadily right across the UK for some time. ‘This is partly down to the problem of the scarcity of mortgage finance and the large deposits required by lenders. ‘These barriers to homeownership need to be addressed.’ Today, a typical first-time buyer puts down a 20 per cent deposit. Before the credit crunch, which marked its fifth anniversary yesterday, it was only 10 per cent. RICS predicts rents will continue to rise over the next year, with many of its members, who are lettings agents, describing the market as ‘very busy’, ‘buoyant’ with ‘strong demand.’ Concerning: Today, a typical first-time buyer puts down a 20 per cent deposit. Before the credit crunch, which marked its fifth anniversary yesterday, it was only 10 per cent . Ed Stansfield, chief UK property economist at the consultancy, Capital Economics, said: ‘Landlords are having few problems letting property to frustrated would-be buyers.’ A third of recent first-time buyers were over the age of 34 by the time they managed to get onto the property ladder, according to the Government’s English Housing Survey. It showed the number of households who are privately renting, such as parents with young children, has ballooned to its highest level since the 1970s. There are 3.6million households who are privately renting from a landlord in 2010/11, the latest available figures, compared to just two million a decade ago. In England, there are 14.45million homeowners, but the figure peaked at 14.8million in 2006. Mark Harris, chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘It is no surprise that the buy-to-let sector continues with its strong performance. ‘As would-be first-time buyers continue to struggle to get on the housing ladder, more people are turning to renting. ‘This is pushing up rents, making the sector increasingly attractive to investors.’ Between April and June, a total of 33,200 buy-to-let loans were handed out, up 14 per cent over the last year, according to the CML.","Council of Mortgage Lenders: Now 1.42 million buy-to-let mortgages, compared to just 89,000 a decade ago .

After walking into a Stroudsburg, PA bank armed with a shotgun and handing a teller a note, the bank's double security doors trapped him harmlessly in the vestibule until cops arrived. His four-year sentence came after pleading guilty to a single count of attempted robbery, PhillyBurbs.com reported. This time he is charged with one count of robbery, two counts of attempted robbery and three counts of making terroristic threats.","Luke Radick allegedly tried to rob three banks while running a taxi fare, but only made off with money from one .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 06:17 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:25 EST, 17 May 2013 . A jailed terrorist who helped to plot an early attack on the World Trade Center has condemned modern jihad and said young men are throwing their lives away by killing innocent people. After being imprisoned for shooting and killing a high-profile rabbi in New York, Egyptian El Sayyid A. Nosair, now 57, went on to help mastermind the 1993 bombing of the Twin Towers from prison. But Nosair, described as 'a star and a hero in the jihad', has attempted to distance himself from radicals behind recent atrocities like last month's Boston Marathon bombings, which claimed three lives and left hundreds wounded. Extremist: El Sayyid A. Nosair, seen left as a young man, confessed to shooting and killing high-profile Rabbi Meir Kahane, seen right in 1985, in a New York hotel in 1990 . He spoke out despite having being convicted of involvement in the 1993 terror attack that killed six people and could have resulted in the loss of thousands of lives. Nosair is thought to have become the first Islamic jihadist to commit murder on American soil when he shot Rabbi Meir Kahane in the ballroom of a New York City hotel in 1990. The father of two, who has remained behind bars ever since, exhibits no remorse over the killing, which he claims was justified because Rabbi Kahane had called for war against Muslims. But Nosair told the Los Angeles Times that by murdering innocent bystanders - as seen in New York, Boston and elsewhere in the years since - extremists did nothing to further their cause. 'There is a difference in the 'passion' that jihadist young men aspire to today and what I was trying to accomplish back in the late '80s and early '90s,' Nosair told the newspaper, adding that he would urge young jihadists to practise restraint. 'Seek help in patience and prayer,' he said. Early attack: Six people were killed and more than 1,000 injured when a truck bomb was detonated in a car park beneath the North Tower in February 1993 . Truck bomb: Port Authority and New York City Police officers are seen inspecting the damage after the explosion in 1993, which left six people dead and over 1,000 injured . Nosair - who is attempting to mount a case to win his freedom - confessed to the murder of Rabbi Kahane to the FBI in 2010, but now claims he was only present at the assassination. He also claims the bombers in the 1993 World Trade Center attack were the masterminds, not him, despite evidence to the contrary. But his new claims - and his remarks on modern jihad - have been dismissed by the team of prosecutors who helped to put Nosair behind bars. Federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy, who said Nosair was a 'star and a hero in the jihad', maintains the 57-year-old will 'never get out'. The very mention of the World Trade Center summons visions of that fateful day in September 2001 when hijacked planes hit the Twin Towers; leaving thousands dead and the western world irrevocably changed. But the Manhattan landmark had been targeted by terrorists eight years before 9/11. On February 26 1993, a truck bomb was detonated beneath the North Tower of the World Trade Center. While the explosion did not bring the towers down as the attackers had planned, it did kill six people and injure more than 1,000. In March 1994, four men were convicted of carrying out the attack; Mahmud Abouhalima, Ahmad Ajaj, Nidal A. Ayyad and Mohammad Salameh. Egyptian El Sayyid A. Nosair was convicted of involvement in the bombing and given a life sentence in 1995. Nosair, who is divorced from his wife and estranged from his two sons, has led prison demonstrations and has threatened fellow inmates to try and force them to convert to Islam. He was initially suspected to have played a role in the September 11 World Trade Center attacks, and has said there may have been 'something I could have done, in my earlier life, to prevent such an occurrence'. Nosair became a U.S. citizen after immigrating from Egypt in 1981, and worked as an engineer in the state courthouse in Manhattan. He targeted Rabbi Kahane at the urging of Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind sheikh who would later be convicted with him on conspiracy charges relating to the 1993 World Trade Center attack. After shooting the rabbi on November 5 1990, Nosair was cleared of murder by a jury in state court but convicted on gun charges. He was sentenced to the maximum 22 years by a judge. His meetings with old cohorts who visited him in jail were monitored by FBI agents, who recorded bomb-making activities underway in Queens. Nosair was sentenced to life with no parole in October 1995 after prosecutors assembled a conspiracy case encompassing the World Trade Center explosion - which killed six people and injured over 1,000 - and federal charges for the murder of Kahane.","El Sayyid A.

Amelia Earhart went missing during her round-the-world attempt in 1937 after becoming the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She was formally declared dead in 1939 but her remains have never been found. Amelia was on the final stage of an an ambitious around-the-world flight along the equator in a twin-engine Lockheed Electra when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared.

The International Group for Historic . Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) believe the evidence could finally pave the . way to solving the 76-year-old mystery. Conspiracy theories about Earhart's final moments have flourished for years. One contended that Earhart was held by Japanese imperial forces as a spy. Another claimed she completed her flight, but changed her identity and settled in New Jersey. Earhart's story - as well as her mysterious demise - have captivated America for decades. She has been portrayed on the big screen by A-List actresses like Diane Keaton, Amy Adams and Hillary Swank. The most widely accepted theory is that the aircraft ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven. Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island. A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press. A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale. An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip. The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman from New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.","Carol Vorderman will embark on her 29,000-mile journey next year .

However, thanks to the pioneering treatment, she is now 26 weeks pregnant with twins. Scroll down for video... Vali (pictured with her partner, Dean) was rendered infertile by ovarian cancer treatment but is now pregnant with twins after doctors transplanted frozen ovarian tissue into her abdomen . When Vali was being treated for cancer, doctors at Melbourne IVF and The Royal Melbourne Hospital froze some of her non-cancerous ovarian tissue, The Age reports. The team later transplanted the frozen tissue into her abdomen allowing her to produce two healthy eggs. This is the first time that a woman has conceived after having ovarian tissue removed and then replaced in a different part of her body. However, Vali’s fertility doctor, Associate Professor Kate Stern, warns that it has taken many years of treatment and almost daily procedures to achieve the conception. She told The age: ‘When it happened I think we all had a good cry together really. Never once did she waver and tell us it was too hard and she wanted to give up.’ However, Associate Professor Stern says that it is very exciting that it has now been proved that ovarian tissue can function outside of the pelvis. This is the first time that a woman has become pregnant after having ovarian tissue removed and then transplanted into a different part of her body . When she was being treated for cancer, keyhole surgery was performed to take a sample of Vali’s ovarian tissue from her non-cancerous ovary. This was then frozen. Seven years later, the tissue was transplanted onto the wall of her abdomen. After months of hormone treatment, the tissue produced follicles and two eggs. These eggs were both fertilised and implanted into her womb. Vali had keyhole surgery to remove some tissue from her non-cancerous ovary.

The Royal Melbourne Hospital now hopes to set up a centre at which it could collect and store tissue from women with conditions that could make them infertile. The hospital has already collected samples from about 300 such patients. Gab Kovacs, the international medical director of Monash IVF, which did the first successful Australian ovarian tissue transplant, told The Age: ‘It makes me quite convinced that the optimal way for preserving fertility will be taking ovarian tissue. ‘If I had a patient who was going to lose their fertility to cancer treatment I would offer it from now on.’","A woman, known as Vali, was made infertile by ovarian cancer treatment .

Researchers said getting a good night's sleep is particularly important to pre-teens . TVs and computers should be banned from children’s bedrooms, scientists have said. They warned that electronic devices can disturb sleep, leading to memory problems and poorer marks in school. They added that sleep may be particularly important for pre-teens, who are about to go through puberty. The Finnish researchers asked 353 children aged 10 to 11 about their TV and computer use and their sleeping habits and quizzed them again 18 months later. The more a child played on the computer or watched the TV, the later they went to bed. They also slept less on school nights. Having a TV or computer in the bedroom appeared to be particularly disruptive for boys, the journal BMC Public Health reports. The University of Helsinki researchers said that children who play a lot on computers of TVs may exercise less and so be less tired at bedtime. Hormonal changes brought on by the light of the screens could also make it more difficult to drop off. Researcher Teija Nuutinen, of the University of Helsinki, electronic devices should be kept out of children’s bedrooms and added: ‘Children need extra sleep as they go through puberty but our study finds that TV and computer use affect the sleep of children. ‘This is especially true during the week and may be impacting their school work as well as their development. ‘Media viewing habits should be considered for kids who are tired and struggling to concentrate, or who have behaviour problems caused by lack of sleep.’ Concentration and behaviour were affected when children were allowed to have TVs or computers in their bedrooms .","Researchers said the more a child played on the computer the later they went to sleep .

He reportedly grew frustrated because he was interrupted while playing an Xbox game. Taliqa suffered terrible head injuries and died in hospital the next day. Betrayal: Louis Burdett (left) was found guilty of the murder of Taliqa Fields (right) Sentencing him, High Court Judge Mr Justice Flaux said: 'Within the short time you lived with Zoe she came to rely upon you and trusted you to look after her two children. 'What's clear was you were more interested in playing your games on the Xbox than looking after her children. 'She interrupted your game and she got on your nerves. The catalyst for your violence was shockingly mundane.' He said Burdett was angry and resentful at being left at home looking after Miss Harman's children while she went out to eat. 'You took out that anger and resentment on the baby, who you accepted, in your evidence, was a sitting target,' he said. Guilty: Louis Burdett received a life sentence . Burdett, who claimed Taliqa had . simply stopped breathing and collapsed, denied murder but was found . guilty by a jury at Leicester Crown Court. The jobless 22-year-old was jailed for life, with a recommendation he serve at least 13 years. The . jury heard how Burdett was looking after Taliqa and her two-year-old . brother Daryce at Zoe’s home on July 1 last year when she called at . 12:37pm to say she was going to have a burger with an old flame. By 12:51pm Burdett had dialled 999 to say Taliqa had gone ‘limp’. Yvonne Coen QC, prosecuting, said: ‘From the defendant’s point of view he was looking after her children whilst she was in town, meeting an ex-boyfriend in McDonald’s. ‘He was, we suggest, quite likely in a rage. He took out his irritation or jealousy on Taliqa and inflicted a serious head injury in what, according to doctors’ opinions, was a sustained assault. ‘The distribution of the injuries suggests she was gripped and shaken and came into contact with a hard surface. ‘She also had a fractured left collarbone. He must have known he’d caused serious harm.’ The court heard Burdett was ‘virtually living’ with Zoe, 24, at her home in Leicester when he agreed to look after her children while she attended a college course. But she finished early and arranged to meet a former childhood sweetheart she had bumped into on a bus. However, Ms Coen said that when Zoe called Burdett to tell him of her plans, he seemed ‘grumpy’. As a result of his attitude, worried Zoe finished her food quickly and returned home to find an ambulance outside her house. She went with her daughter to hospital, where she was put into intensive care. Tragedy: Taliqa was 'a defenceless child with her whole life ahead of her' said Detective Superintendent Steve Craddock . But the toddler, who suffered swelling and bleeding on the brain, died 24 hours later. Burdett, of Leicester, went on to accept he repeatedly lied to police by pretending he was not living at Zoe’s home. The . court heard his account was also inconsistent, firstly telling police . and a neighbour he was on an X-Box when Taliqa fell ill, then telling . jurors he was watching TV. After . the verdict, Detective Superintendent Steve Craddock, who led the . investigation, said: ‘What Burdett did to Taliqa is incomprehensible. She was a defenceless child with her whole life ahead of her and this . was taken away.’ Devastating: Louis Burdett killed Taliqa Fields at her home in Leicester (Pictured: General view of the street) Taliqa’s father Jason Fields and her . mother Zoe, who do not live together, said: ‘We are absolutely . devastated by what has happened to our daughter. ‘Every day is incredibly hard to get . through. We used to get up in the morning and bath and dress her and now . we have none of that as it was taken away from us. Some days we . struggle to even get out of bed. We feel lost. ‘Seeing our family and friends playing with their children can be really hard as it brings back so many memories for us. It should be us sat there playing with Taliqa and it is really heart breaking that we can’t. ‘In her short life Taliqa brought so much happiness to us. She was a lovely girl who loved dancing and was always happy and smiling. We have so many fond memories of her. ‘What happened is such a waste of a life - she was just ten months old.’","Louis Burdett from Leicester was supposed to be babysitting ten-month-old Taliqa Fields .

After refusing to get out of the car, Sowells was dragged out by police, confronted with Tasers and arrested for obstruction. Despite the dramatic test drive, the man still bought the BMW. Test drive trauma: Jon-Christopher Sowells (right) was pulled over by police while test driving a BMW and was arrested for obstruction . According to Channel 2, Sowells was unsure why he had been stopped. He said: ‘[The policeman] said ""You don’t have any tags on the car"". I said “No problem, I don’t have any tags on this car because it’s not my car”.’ Sowells told the police that if they called the dealer, he would confirm Sowells' story but officers asked to see paperwork which was sitting on the back seat of the car. Unsure what the paperwork was for, Sowells refused to hand it over. Not far from dealership: Sowells was test driving a vehicle from Philip Motors (pictured) when the incident occurred . Sowells said: ‘They asked me to get . out of the car. I said “I don’t feel comfortable”.

Based on his refusal to provide information and his passive and then active resistance, Mr Sowells was charged with obstruction.’ After the dealer could not be reached on the telephone, an officer drove to the dealership to confirm Sowells’ story. Sowells said: ‘The dealer comes out to pick the car up and at this point, I'm thinking we can all go home everything is OK now. No it's not OK, I'm going to jail.’ On another dramatic test drive, an unidentified man was test driving a Lamborghini Aventador worth £241,000 last year when it burst into flames.

"By . Daniel Martin . UPDATED: . 04:43 EST, 1 October 2011 . An alliance of European countries is rebelling against EU plans to make Britain open its doors to thousands of ‘benefit tourists’. Ministers have joined forces with 12 other nations – including France, Germany and Denmark – angry at the European Commission’s threat to take the UK to court over rules which limit foreigners’ ability to claim benefits. If the Commission gets its way, Britain could be hit with an extra £2.5billion in welfare payments, making it even harder to tackle our huge deficit. Present rules: Currently, the UK says EU immigrants must have worked here previously, or have a decent chance of getting a job, before they can claim benefits . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain  Duncan Smith warned that the move  was just the latest example of ‘unelectable and unaccountable’ European  institutions’ desire to grab power from national parliaments. The row comes as Tories gather for  their annual conference in Manchester amid a growing clamour from Eurosceptic backbenchers to use the eurozone  crisis as a lever to get Brussels powers returned to Britain. Last night former Cabinet minister John Redwood said the issue showed why Foreign Secretary William Hague should enter into negotiations with EU leaders to get powers handed back to Britain. He wrote on his blog: ‘What is he doing about it? Why won’t he get on with renegotiating the UK position? ‘Most UK electors want a trade agreement but do not want to be bossed around by a high spending legislature poking its nose into our domestic affairs.’ Diktat: The European Commission in Brussels gave the UK two months to scrap the rules, saying they infringe the 'human rights' of EU citizens . Concerns: It is feared the change could open the door to tens of thousands of Eastern Europeans who are currently deterred from coming here . At present the UK says that EU immigrants must have worked here previously, or have a decent chance of getting a job, before they can claim benefits. But on Thursday Brussels gave the UK two months to scrap the rules, saying they infringe the ‘human rights’ of EU citizens. It is feared the change could open the door to tens of thousands of Eastern Europeans who are currently deterred from coming here. Benefits are much more generous in the West than among the former Soviet-dominated countries of the East. 'Out of order': Iain Duncan Smith said Europe was encroaching on social security . For example, a person who has been . unemployed for more than three months in Poland gets a dole of just £110 . a month. This is less than half the £270 or so he would get if he moved . to the UK. So far only Britain has been threatened with court action, but yesterday an EU official warned that other countries could be next if their residence rules are deemed too strict. Chris Grayling, the Employment Minister, revealed growing anger among European governments and said he would be bringing up the issue at a meeting of ministers in Brussels in three weeks’ time. His alliance is made up of prosperous Western European countries which are also worried about an influx from former Communist states if they are forced to change their rules. They, too, face huge costs if they have to tighten up their rules. France, for example, will currently not pay out benefits unless migrants have worked in the country for at least four months. Mr Grayling told the BBC: ‘There is a very definite difference of opinion between us and the Commission over this. I don’t think somebody coming from another EU state should be able to access benefit simply by turning up here and saying, “I am going to live in the UK from now on”. ‘The truth is European law is all over the place at the moment. We had a case three months ago in which we were instructed by the European Court to make disability payments to a British citizen, a young woman living in Spain. 'This kind of land grab has the potential to cause mayhem... we will fight it' ‘We can’t be responsible both for benefits to be paid to our citizens overseas and to citizens of other countries in the UK. What we have ended up with is a mess and it is not a mess that simply faces the UK – it is one that affects several other states.’ Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail: ‘This is out of order. Social security was always considered to be a national responsibility, but now Europe is encroaching on these areas. ‘This kind of land grab from the EU has the potential to cause mayhem to nation states, and we will fight it.’ It emerged yesterday that Nick Clegg told EC president Jose Manuel Barroso on Thursday that Britain would fight any attempt to force us to pay benefits to workless EU migrants. The Lib Dems’ support for the Government on this issue is in contrast to their refusal to join the Tories in opposing the extension of employment rights to agency workers. A source close to Mr Clegg said: ‘Nick thinks this is a really bad idea. It is one thing to look after European citizens who have worked over here and paid taxes, but it is quite another to start writing cheques to anyone and everyone who turns up.’ A spokesman for the European Commission said the UK was being targeted first because complaints had been received about the rule here. But she warned that other countries would be next.She said: ‘We have issues with other countries but the UK case is much more advanced.’","Alliance to rebel against EU plans to make Britain open its doors to 'benefits tourists'

We wondered what the Sarkozy couple . would do with themselves after leaving office, and now we know – play . happy families!’ The apparent revelation comes after . suggestions that Miss Bruni – who also has an 11-year-old son from a . previous relationship – had ‘fallen into depression’ since her husband’s . election defeat. Friends told another French magazine she had the ‘baby blues’ after  giving birth to Giulia last October and . was now suffering the ‘presidential blues’. Doctors were urging the former supermodel to have 'total rest' because she is an older mother giving birth in her 40s, Closer said.

"By . Ap . PUBLISHED: . 00:51 EST, 26 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:33 EST, 26 May 2013 . Some call it wishful thinking, but President Barack Obama has all but declared an end to the global war on terror.Obama is not claiming final victory over extremists who still seek to kill Americans and other Westerners. Instead, he is refocusing the long struggle against terrorism that lies ahead, steering the United States away from what he calls an equally frightening threat - a country in a state of perpetual war. In doing so, Obama recasts the image of the terrorists themselves, from enemy warriors to cowardly thugs and resets the relationship between the U.S. and Islam.His speech Thursday was designed to move America's mindset away from a war footing and refine and recalibrate his own counterterrorism strategy. Obama asserted that al-Qaida is 'on the path to defeat,' reducing the scale of terrorism to pre-Sept. 11 levels. That means that with the Afghanistan war winding down, Obama is unlikely to commit troops in large numbers to any conflict - in Syria or other countries struggling with instability in the uncertain aftermath of the Arab Spring - unless, as his critics fear, he tragically has underestimated al-Qaida's staying power. 'Over': President Barack Obama Thursday declared the war on terror to be 'over' - much to the chagrin of Republicans in Congress . 'Wishing the defeat of terrorists does not make it so,' said Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican who is vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and a member of the House Intelligence Committee.In Thornberry's view, Obama is pushing the idea that 'we can simply declare al-Qaida beaten and go back to the pre-9/11 era.'From the beginning of his presidency, Obama's centerpiece of his national security strategy has been a desire to move beyond the wars he inherited in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in the shadowy spaces occupied by al-Qaida and its offshoots now creeping up in North Africa and elsewhere. 'Too often, this president has sought to end combat operations through rhetoric rather than reality,' GOP Rep. Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon of California, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Friday. 'He has declared the war in Iraq over, but the insurgency there continues. He has declared an end to combat operations in Afghanistan, but the Taliban fight on. He has now declared the war on terrorism over, despite a terrorist attack in Britain this week, a terrorist attack in Boston last month and a terrorist attack in Libya that left a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead last year.'Yet the president cautioned against a return to what he called a complacency in counterterrorism before Islamic extremists hijacked U.S. jetliners and slammed them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.'Make no mistake,' he said, 'our nation is still threatened by terrorists,' noting that the deadly attacks in Benghazi, Libya, last September and in Boston last month were tragic reminders. 'We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root' But he also left little doubt that he thinks it is time to turn the page on the post-9/11 approach. He was referring not only to the controversial use of armed drones to target terrorists in Pakistan, Afghanistan and other countries, but also the commitment of tens of thousands of U.S. ground troops in conventional fighting.'For all the focus on the use of force, force alone cannot make us safe,' he said. 'We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root,' adding that 'a perpetual war - through drones or Special Forces or troop deployments - will prove self-defeating and alter our country in troubling way.'Some counterterrorism experts long have argued that the global war on terror should be brought to a close, and that some of the policies and programs put in place after 9/11 should be reconsidered and possibly changed.James Lewis, a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argues for a more traditional approach to battling terrorism, largely through law enforcement and the intelligence community.Lewis said that ending the fight against terrorism will help reinforce the administration's message that America is not at war with Islam.'It helps, because it delegitimizes the terrorists,' said Lewis. 'They want to think of themselves as warriors. We want the world to think of them as crooks. We want everyone in every country not to think of them as terrorists defending Islam, but as people who are psychos. They are criminals, and that's what we want to paint them as.' The 'end': Republicans in Congress tend to disagree . That is closely in line with Obama's description of what remains of the terrorist threat.He said core al-Qaida, the organization formerly led by Osama bin Laden, is 'a shell of its former self.' The president said that while one of its most troublesome affiliates, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, is a force to be reckoned with, 'in the years to come, not every collection of thugs that labels themselves al-Qaida will pose a credible threat to the United States.'He also cautioned against the threat of homegrown extremists and said terrorism may never go away entirely.'But as we shape our response, we have to recognize that the scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11,' he said.","Obama says al-Qaida is 'on the path to defeat,' reducing the scale of terrorism to pre-Sept. 11 levels.

The final words of three terrified pilots on board an Air France jet which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean have emerged today for the first time. In a scandal which is set to shock all those who work or travel on commercial flights, they reveal absolute panic and ignorance among those in charge of the aircraft. The exchange is from the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) on Flight 447, which went down in a tropical storm with the loss of 228 lives while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in June 2009. Wreckage: Brazil Navy sailors recover debris from Air France flight 447. A new book on the crash has revealed pilots panicked as the plane lost altitude . Doomed: Flight captain Marc Dubois, left, was not in the cockpit when the plane stalled. Right, Pierre-Cedric Bonin said he had lost control of the aircraft . Marc Dubois (captain): 'Get your wings horizontal.' David Robert (pilot): 'Level your wings.' Pierre-Cedric Bonin (pilot): 'That's what I'm trying to do... What the... how is it we are going down like this?' Robert: 'See what you can do with the commands up there, the primaries and so on…Climb climb, climb, climb.' Bonin: 'But I have been pulling back on the stick all the way for a while.' Dubois: 'No, no, no, don't climb.' Robert: 'Ok give me control, give me control.' Dubois: 'Watch out you are pulling up.' Robert: 'Am I?' Bonin: 'Well you should, we are at 4,000.' As they approach the water, the on-board computer is heard to announce: 'Sink rate. Pull up, pull up, pull up.' To which Captain Dubois reacts with the words: 'Go on: pull.' Bonin: 'We're pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling.' The crew never discuss the possibility that they are about to crash, instead concentrating on trying to right the plane throughout the final four minutes. Dubois: 'Ten degrees pitch.' Robert: 'Go back up!…Go back up!…Go back up!… Go back up!' Bonin: 'But I’ve been going down at maximum level for a while.' Dubois: 'No, No, No!… Don’t go up !… No, No!' Bonin: 'Go down, then!' Robert: 'Damn it! We’re going to crash. It can’t be true!' Bonin: 'But what’s happening?!' The recording stops. 'Damn it! We're going to crash. It can't be true,' says one of the pilots. 'But, what's happening?' another replies, seconds before the Airbus 330 plunged into the water, killing everyone on board including five Britons and three Irish doctors. Until now only selected excerpts from the conversation between David Robert, 37, Pierre-Cedric Bonin, 32, and Marc Dubois, 58, the captain of the plane, have been released. Air accident investigators kept the rest hidden, saying they did not want to upset families of the pilots lost in the worst crash in the company's history. But now Jean-Pierre Otelli, a veteran French flying instructor, has written a book in which he lays the dramatic moments bare. Rio-Paris Crash: A Collection of Pilot Errors describes how the men failed to deal with a loss of lift. Mr Dubois, who had 11,000 flying . hours behind him, was on a routine break when it happened, leaving his . two subordinates in charge. 'So, . is he coming?' Mr Robert is heard muttering, even swearing in . frustration when Mr Dubois takes a full minute to get back to the . cockpit. 'Hey, what are . you...' Mr Dubois is heard to say when he gets back, to which Mr Robert . replies: 'What's happening? I don't know, I don't know what's . happening.' Instead of . lowering the plane's nose to deal with the stall - as they should have . done according to normal procedures - they raised it. Mr . Bonin is heard saying: 'I've got a problem I don't have vertical speed. I don't have any indication,' before his captain replies: 'I don't . know, but right now we're descending.' Air France argues that the pilots . were baffled by numerous confusing signals from the Airbus, while the . plane manufacturer insists that it was responding properly. As the plane approaches the sea, the crew began conversing in short, panicked questions. 'What do you think? What do you think? What should we do?' said Mr Robert, while the plane rocked from side-to-side. 'I . don't have control of the plane, I don't have control of the plane at . all,' Mr Bonin replied, as a stall alarm resounded for the sixth time in . two minutes. According to . an official report released earlier this year, the last words were from . Captain Dubois who said: 'Ten degrees pitch.' But in his new book Mr Otellis asks who will be held responsible 'for this mess'. Inexperience? One of the plane's flight data recorders on the ocean bed. Recordings made in the cockpit have revealed the two co-pilots were too panicked to tell the captain what was happening . Disaster: The aircraft was in an aerodynamic stall, but the pilots failed to push the nose down to correct it . 'It is a training problem, fatigue, lack of sleep, or is it due to the fact the pilots are confident than an Airbus can make up for all errors?,' he writes. France's air accident investigation unit, the BEA, reacted angrily to the publication of the book, with a spokesman saying printing the conversation showed a 'lack of respect to the memory of the crew who died'. Air France has denied that its pilots were incompetent, but has since improved training, concentrating on how to fly a plane manually when there is a stall. Both Air France and Airbus are facing manslaughter charges, with a judicial investigation led by Paris judges already under way. A judge has already ordered Air France to pay some £120,000 in compensation to the families of each victim, but this is just a provisional figure which is likely to multiply many times over.",Flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris went down in Atlantic Ocean with loss of 228 lives .

Nyad today broke swimmer Penny Palfrey's . 2012 distance record in the Cuba to Florida swim. The 64-year-old's last attempt was cut short amid boat trouble, storms, unfavorable currents and jellyfish stings that left her face puffy and swollen. This time she wore a full bodysuit, gloves, booties and a mask at night, when jellyfish rise to the surface. Before the swim, she said the kit would slow her down, but she believed it would be effective. The support team accompanying her had equipment that generated a faint electrical field around her, which was designed to keep sharks at bay. A boat also dragged a line in the water to help keep her on course.

A live map has been documenting Diana's progress since she set off from Havana on Saturday morning. She is now only two miles from Key West . The swimmer paused on Monday to . give a statement of thanks to her team before embarking on the final two . miles of the grueling feat. Ms Nyad said: 'This . is a lifelong dream of mine and I'm very very glad to be with you. Some . on the team are the most intimate friends of my life and some of you . I've just met.' 'But I'll . tell you something, you're a special group. You pulled through; you are . pros and have a great heart. So let's get going so we can have a . whopping party. 'Thank you, all of you, thank you for your generosity.' Nyad told supporters a silicone mask . she wore to protect her face from jellyfish stings caused bruises inside . her mouth, making it difficult for her to talk. Doctors . traveling with Nyad were worried about her slurred speech and her . breathing, but they didn't intervene, according to her website. Nyad's journey began on Saturday morning . when she jumped from the seawall of the Hemingway Marina into the warm . waters off Havana. She stopped from time to time for nourishment. Keep going! Diana pauses to talk to her crew less than two miles from the Florida shore . Epic journey: Nyad is trialed by kayakers as she completes the grueling feat without a shark cage . 'I . admit there's an ego rush,' Nyad said before the swim began. 'If I - . three days from now, four days from now — am still somehow bringing the . arms up and I see the shore … I am going to have a feeling that no one . yet on this planet has ever had.' The swimmer's support team which . includes kayakers, shark divers and five boats with crews, snapped into . safety protocol when a storm hit at 11pm on Sunday. Nyad . however was 'still swimming strong' with the watchful shark divers by . her side. A radio communication to one of the support team's vessel . said: 'Prepare for the worst, hoping for the best'. At 1.27am, the team decided they were free of danger and 'got the flotilla back in normal formation quickly.' Good start: Diana Nyad began her swim on Saturday morning at Hemingway Marina to start her attempt at swimming from Cuba to Florida. She was just shy of 20 miles from completing the swim this morning . Marathon simmer: It was Nyad's fifth attempt in three years to swim from Cuba to the Florida Keys without the aid of a shark tank - and she finally succeeded . The swimmer will take regular breaks . to eat, but must remain in the water and isn't allowed to touch the side . of the boat that will be tracking her progress. 'This . is farther than she has gone in any previous attempt,' team navigator . John Bartlett wrote on Nyad's website yesterday. 'Her path is only 5 . miles to the east of a straight line from Marina Hemingway to Key West, . thanks to a favorable Gulf Stream.' A post on Nyad's blog said she was doing well and the crew is upbeat, though she expressed some fatigue . during a pause to eat. Doctors examine her regularly and say 'she's . looking very good.' As of 9am Sunday morning, Nyad was over 38 miles into her swim, averaging 1.6 miles per hour. Nyad keeps hydrated and fueled with smoothies, 'shot blocks', peanut butter sandwiches and pasta. 'She's right on the bullseye,' navigator John Bartlett said. 'We are just approaching the strongest flow of the Gulfstream about 15 miles ahead of us. At that point, the flow direction will change and that will help us big time.' Helpers: A group of boats are following Nyad on her journey, helping to spot jellyfish and sharks as she swims day and night to reach the Florida Keys . Perilous: One of the greatest dangers Nyad faces is the dangerous Box Jellyfish which could render her paralyzed if stung . It's Nyad's fifth attempt at the feat in the last three years. She also made an unsuccessful try with a cage in 1978. The swimmer expected to take about 80 hours to reach the Florida Keys. This . attempt is different though, in that Nyad will be swimming at night . with the aid of a silicon mask to protect herself from Box Jellyfish. The Box Jellyfish is one of the world's most venomous creatures. They actively hunt their prey and their stings can send the body into paralysis. Since 1950, more people have died from Box Jellyfish stings than from shark bites. This . year she had prosthetics maker Stefan Knauss custom make a face mask . that she could wear at night when the jellyfish are harder to see. She . says it's harder to swim while wearing, but she tested it out in a . swarm of hundreds of Box Jellyfish this past June and wasn't stung once. Nyad's handlers were giving fans status updates on Sunday through her website. Secret weapon: This is Nyad's first attempt using the prosthetic face mask custom-made to shield her from the paralyzing stings of the box jellyfish . Has it made a difference? The mask was custom made by prosthetics maker Stefan Knauss to shield her entire face from the jellyfish. Last time she only wore panty hose and still got stung .","Diana Nyad completed the swim in 52 hours, 54 minutes and 18 seconds .

Protesters around the world took to the streets to protest Saturday for and against a possible U.S.-led attack on Syria, as President Barack Obama announced he would seek congressional approval for such a move. Obama said the U.S. should take action against Syria to punish it for what the U.S. believes was a deadly chemical attack launched by Syrian President Bashar Assad this month that killed more than 1,400 people. But Obama said he wants Congress to debate and vote on whether to use force, and has said any possible strike would be limited. People demonstrate against a US-led strike on Syria in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday . In Houston, which has a large Syrian-American population, about 100 people lined up on opposite sides of a street in an upscale neighborhood to express opposing views on a possible U.S. attack. 'We want any kind of action. The world has stood silently and it's been too long. Something needs to be done,' said Tamer Barazi, a 23-year-old civil engineer who carried a Syrian flag and a sign stating 'Syrian Americans for peace, democracy and freedom in Syria.' Standing across the street in Houston's sweltering heat were those opposing U.S. intervention, outnumbering the supporters of an intervention. Some carried signs stating 'We Don't Want Obama's War' and 'Hands Off Syria.' 'How would you like another country to decide who is going to be the president of the United States?' asked 53-year-old Hisam Saker, a Syrian-American property manager who has lived in Houston for 33 years. Demonstrators are directed by a police officer in front of the White House during a rally against a possible US attack on Syria, in Washington, DC on Saturday . Hundreds of people protest against military intervention in Syria at Trafalgar Square in London on Saturday . The demonstrations erupted on both East and West coasts of the United States, and cities in between. In Washington, as Obama addressed the nation from the Rose Garden, anti-war demonstrators chanted and waved placards outside the White House. Across the street, Syrians and Syrian Americans who support U.S. action waved flags from their country and shouted for Assad's ouster. 'The conflict's been going on for, what, almost two years now. Estimates are 100,000 Syrian civilians have been killed and all of a sudden the U.S. government has manufactured the excuse of the use of chemical weapons in Syria to use that excuse to intervene in Syria,' said Tristan Brosnan, 25, of Washington. Later, in Los Angeles, about 200 people shouting 'Hands off Syria' protested against a possible American strike. They waved signs reading 'No More War' and police said they wrote up more than 40 citations after demonstrators sat in street intersections and blocked traffic. Police reported two arrests.

More than two dozen protesters gathered at the Arkansas Capitol to oppose a possible U.S. attack. Some wore T-shirts proclaiming 'NO U.S. INTERVENTION IN SYRIA.' 'I had friends that died in Iraq, and I don't want more people to die for nothing,' said Dominic Box, 23, expressing some of the fears of a war-weary public.

Family: Tia Sharp's mother Natalie and grandmother Christine Bicknell arriving at the Old Bailey today . The man accused of murdering schoolgirl Tia Sharp claimed her death was an accident and insisted ‘I’m not like Ian Huntley’, a court heard yesterday. Stuart Hazell told prison officers after his arrest that ‘nothing sexual’ had happened between him and 12-year-old Tia. Prosecutors allege he smothered Tia and took pictures of her naked body before hiding her in the attic of the house he shared with the youngster’s grandmother, Christine Bicknell, in Croydon, South London. They claim Hazell, 37, was obsessed with paedophile websites and in the weeks before her death repeatedly filmed Tia as she slept – and on one occasion as she rubbed cream on her legs while in her underwear. But following his arrest last August, Hazell protested to Belmarsh prison officer Warren Fegan that he was not like notorious Soham killer Huntley, who was jailed for 40 years for killing Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. Mr Fegan told the Old Bailey: ‘He was saying, “I’m not like Ian Huntley, it was nothing sexual, I’m not a nonce”. ‘He was saying that the Press were trying to make it look like it was sexual but it wasn’t. ‘He said it was an accident, that she’d fallen down the stairs and broken her neck. ‘He said he didn’t know what to do so he picked her up and took her upstairs and laid her on the bed. He said he thought she’d get better. He didn’t know what to do so he wrapped her up in a sheet and put her in the loft.’ The prison officer said Hazell asked him how hard it would be to get a not guilty verdict for murder but guilty for manslaughter. He added that when window cleaner Hazell was assessed at the prison he was deemed to be at ‘extreme’ risk of harming himself. ‘He really wanted to kill himself. He was saying he was sorry and he felt guilty. He wanted to be dead. He wanted away from everything.’ Mr Fegan said that in another conversation two days later, Hazell told him that he ‘wished he could turn back the clock’. ‘He said, “I deserve everything I get – 25 to 30 years, I don’t care”. ‘He said he couldn’t get the images of Tia out of his head once the police had shown him. 'I remember asking how he was feeling and I remember him putting his face in his hands and saying “guilty”.’ Tia’s decomposed body was discovered wrapped in a sheet and bin liners in Hazell’s loft a week after she was reported missing in August last year. But Hazell told another prison officer, Paul Leahy, that he believed his neighbours had killed Tia and moved her body into his attic through interlinked lofts in the terrace houses. Scroll down for video . Murder: Tia Sharp, left, was allegedly killed by her grandmother's boyfriend Stuart Hazell, right . CCTV: Jurors were yesterday shown images of the pair shopping together shortly before Tia's death . He accused the police of ‘fitting him up’ and said at least six other people had seen Tia alive after him, jurors were told. Hazell is said to have told Mr Leahy: . ‘In my opinion, police need to look at all the neighbours. That’s what . the Press don’t tell you, that all six or eight houses have joined lofts . which are linked together. ‘Police have searched my house four times and not found anything with dogs and from specialist search teams. ‘In my opinion someone moved her into my loft. ‘If you saw my loft you would see it’s impossible for me to get up there. I’m a big bloke. ‘I told police about a couple a few . doors down, a bloke and a woman. I think they are Somalis. They were . shouting and throwing plates at each other, it’s them the police should . look at.’ He said that this couple were the ‘real bacons’ – prison slang . for paedophiles, the court heard. He also told the prison officer that . Tia had been hassled by paedophiles on her phone and said if he had . killed her he would  have ‘done a runner to Scotland or Germany’. The court heard that Hazell also told . Mr Leahy: ‘I have a real problem with my anger and when people say . wrong things to me, I can flip.  I just feel like hurting everyone.’ Heartbroken: Tia's father Steven Carter and his partner Melissa Potter outside court today . The Old Bailey heard that the day after Tia disappeared, Hazell cooked dinner for her and set it aside even though he knew she was already dead. He told Ms Bicknell that she had left the house at midday, and when they sat down to eat at 6pm he saved food for her. 'I put some chips in a separate pot for Tia,' Hazell told police after his arrest. 'I didn't want to do them at the same time and burn them because she always moans. 'We had dinner around 6ish and I put Tia's pizza in the oven so I could just throw the chips in the deep fat fryer when she got in.' A statement from senior prison officer Gerald King, which was read out in court, recounted a conversation he had with Hazell. 'He stated that he wanted to end it and take his life,' the statement said. 'He didn't want to be seen as an Ian Huntley. 'He . added that it was an accident, that he had been playing with her at the . top of the stairs as they always did. She fell down the stairs and . broke her neck. 'He . wished he could turn back time. He then laid her on the bed for a while, . then wrapped her in a blanket and put her in the roof.' Hazell expressed regret at not coming clean about the accident and even joined in with family conversations threatening to take revenge against her killer, according to Mr King. 'He wished that he had explained the accident to his partner but he didn't want to ruin the relationship,' the officer said. On trial: A court sketch drawn earlier this week shows murder suspect Hazell sitting in the dock . Later, junior prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward and Detective Constable Darrell Ayaydin read a transcript of a police witness interview Hazell gave on August 5. In the interview the 37-year-old described meeting Tia in Croydon, the pair spending the evening together before she went to bed, and then her leaving to go to Croydon on her own the following morning. Hazell told police the 12-year-old wanted to buy some sandals, but as he 'hated' shopping, he had given her some money and let her go alone. He also claimed that she mentioned going to meet a boy and spent the night before messaging someone, but 'kicked himself' for not paying attention to the person's name. Natalie Sharp and David Niles leaving the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey, London, earlier this week . The court heard Tia probably died as a result of 'suffocation or chest compression'. And, it was alleged that after murdering Tia, Hazell took a photograph of the 12-year-old’s naked body. Experts were unable to give a definite cause of death as the 12-year-old’s body was so badly decomposed. But pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl said: 'Considering the negative findings and taking this case as a whole as it has been presented to me, it seems a form of suffocation or chest compression would appear to be the most likely cause of death. 'It is one I cannot make for sure because of the condition of the body.' The Old Bailey heard Tia was dressed in a pink and white Little Miss Giggles pyjama set when her body was found a week after she went missing last August. Sobs could be heard from the public gallery as a picture of the 12-year-old's body flashed up on video screens in the courtroom and some family members had to leave. Dr Fegan-Earl told jurors he was unable to find any evidence a brutal attack had taken place but he said: 'It cannot be completely excluded.' Nor could he say if Tia, who was 4ft 11 and weighed 49kgs - nearly eight stone - had definitely been sexually assaulted. He added: 'She was dressed at the time in white and pink pyjama bottoms and a vest which had Little Miss Giggles on.' Mr Fegan-Earl said there were no injuries on her body to suggest she died as a result of a fall, as Hazell claims. She had no broken bones, obvious bruising or bleeding, he said. The court heard the doctor ‘did not find any positive pathological sign of injury.’ But he said if Tia had been suffocated subtle signs of compression to the chest, neck or face could have disappeared post-mortem. Tia's father Steven Carter (centre) and his partner Melissa Potter (right) arrive at the Old Bailey today . Jurors heard there were traces of amphetamine in Tia’s body but the pathologist was certain this was due to natural processes after death and not that she had been drugged. The court was again shown a sickening image of a girl believed to be Tia lying naked on a bed, which was recovered on a memory stick allegedly belonging to Hazell. Mr Fegan-Earl said: 'When I saw this photo there were changes in the body that suggest to me that the individual is dead. 'There is certainly the possibility that this picture is Tia Sharp.' The pathologist added the body showed signs it had been lying for a period of time on its back and had been moved into that position. He identified ‘blood pooling’ in the thighs which he suggested showed the body had been lying face-up for a while after dying. Hazell, of New Addington, Croydon, denies murdering the schoolgirl between August 2 and 10 last year. The trial continues.

"By . Lee Moran and Thomas Durante . UPDATED: . 21:56 EST, 22 December 2011 . Former president Jimmy Carter, who has visited North Korea several times before dictator Kim Jong Il's death, has offered his condolences and well-wishes to the man taking on his rule. The 39th president and 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner said he was looking forward to another visit to the region in a message sent to successor Kim Jong Un. The Korean Central News Agency said: 'He [Carter] wished Kim Jong Un every success as he assumes his new responsibility of leadership, looking forward to another visit to the DPRK in the future'. Sorry for your loss: Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the U.S., said he was looking forward to another visit to the region in a message sent to successor Kim Jong Un . Mr Carter, 87, last visited North Korea in April of this year, hoping to ease tensions over the country's nuclear programme. The message was sent on Sunday, the day Kim's death was reported. His condolences come as a tribute to the late dictator were sent by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who described the 69-year-old North Korean despot as a ‘lovely man’, who ‘was chosen by his people and regularly conducted elections’. Didymus Mutasa, the secretary of administration for Mugabe’s Zanu-PF party, told Zimbabwe state radio: ‘He was our great friend and we are not ashamed of being associated with him.’ The . dead North Korean leader was involved in the training and equipping of a . para-military group in the African country in the early 1980s. Popular leader: A loyalist of Robert Mugabe, left, paid tribute to the dead Korean leader Kim Jong Il, as his son, Kim Jong Un, right, prepared to assume dual control of the country with his uncle . Mugabe . sought help to train the infamous Fifth Brigade unit - which killed . almost 20,000 people in an operation named Gukurahundi, meaning the . first rains that wash the chaff. It has since been described as genocide. Kim Jong Il played an instrumental role in training the crack special killer unit that operated outside normal Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) command. But Methuseli Moyo, spokesman for the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (Zapu), which was at the receiving end of the massacres, said his party had 'no option but to welcome' the demise of the dictator. Jang Song Thaek, who will share power with his nephew, Kim Jong Un, and the military . He said: 'We will not shed any crocodile tears for the trainer of Gukurahundi, the only problem about his death is that it was before he could account for his actions, we are not apologetic about that.' Meanwhile, in Cuba citizens are observing three days of mourning in a show of solidarity for its fellow communist state. Following his father's death, North Korea's new young leader will be Kim Jong Un, who will rule the country alongside his uncle and the military, sources it was revealed today. Jang Song Thaek will work alongside his inexperienced and untested 28-year-old nephew - the first time since the end of World War Two a collective rather than a dictator from the family dynasty will be in charge. The army's backing of Kim Jong Il's third son, his proclaimed successor, has also calmed fears there could be a military coup. And it has prompted speculation there . will now be a smooth transition of power - meaning little change for the . millions of impoverished and poverty-stricken citizens. A . source also revealed that the test-firing of a North Korean missile on . Monday, following the announcement of Kim Jong Il's death on Saturday, . was a warning shot against the U.S. The source said: 'With the missile test, North Korea wanted to deliver the message that they have the ability to protect themselves. 'But North Korea is unlikely to conduct a nuclear test in the near future unless provoked by the United States and South Korea.' Jang Song Thaek's appointment was widely . expected after his addition to the National Defence Commission, the . supreme leadership council led by his brother Kim Jong Il as head of the . military state, in 2009. Collective: North Korean military, who will run the country alongside Kim Jong Il's brother and son, cry as they visit the Kumsusan Memorial Palace to pay their respects to their leader . Lying in state: The body of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is on display at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang . Family affair: Kim Jong Il is pictured on the escalator of a Pyongyang supermarket, with his sister Kim Kyong Hui, his son Kim Jong Un, and his sister's husband Jang Song Thaek behind him . UN food experts urged immediate food aid for the isolated nation just months before Kim Jong Il's (pictured) death. Three groups described the urgent need for food, reporting 'acute malnutrition' among North Korean children, 'widespread consumption of grass' and elderly people on a 'knife edge'. There was 'substantial evidence' of a growing food crisis for millions who live in the countryside - beyond the relative comfort of Pyongyang. 'What we saw was extensive chronic malnutrition and cases of acute malnutrition, which is where the person is basically dying,' said David Austin, director of North Korea's Mercy Corps. He added: 'More than 50 per cent of people who are reliant on (state-provided grain) were out seeking out alternative food - things like bark, wild grass, and leaves - and mixing it in with food. We found there was no protein or fat in people’s diets.' And when he returned in September, government grain rations had been cut by more than half to about 150 grams per day - the equivalent of one potato. Alongside Kim Jong Il's younger sister Kim Kyong Hui, he is expected to guide the 'young general' during his formative days in power. As part of the consolidation of power, security was stepped up in cities and troops put on high alert as South Korean activists launched giant balloons containing tens of thousands of propaganda leaflets across the border. Some showed graphic pictures of former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's battered corpse and described his gruesome death. They oppose a hereditary transfer of power in North Korea - where Kim Jong Il ruled for 17 years after inheriting power from his father, national founder and eternal North Korean President Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994. And in another sign of border tension, Chinese boatmen along a river separating North Korea and China said North Korean police ordered them to stop giving rides to tourists, saying they will fire on the boats if they see anyone with cameras. Meanwhile, the young Kim on Tuesday led a procession of senior officials in a viewing of Kim Jong Il's body, which is being displayed in a glass coffin near that of Kim Il Sung. Publicly presiding over the funeral proceedings was an important milestone for his successor, strengthening his image as the country's political face at home and abroad. State media showed video of Kim Jong Un receiving mourners, including foreign envoys, as he stood near his father's body with an honour guard. He was sombre during the greetings, although footage at one point showed him teary-eyed. A report in the North's official Korean Central News Agency did not specify which foreign countries the envoys represented. According to official media, more than five million North Koreans have gathered at monuments and memorials in the capital since the death of Kim Jong Il. Hundreds of thousands visited monuments around the city within hours of the official announcement that Kim had died. The . North has declared an 11 day period of mourning that will culminate in . his state funeral and a national memorial service on December 28 to 29.

The Guardian newspaper allowed British agents spies into its London offices to oversee destruction of leaked NSA data after the government threatened legal action. The newspaper's editor Alan Rusbridger claimed in an . opinion piece published on the Guardian's website that a pair of . staffers from British eavesdropping agency GCHQ monitored the hard drives being destroyed. Shortly . after his paper began publishing reports based on Snowden's leaks, he . said he was contacted by 'a very senior government official claiming to . represent the views of the prime minister' who demanded the return or . destruction of Snowden's material. Claims: 'Shadowy' Government figures were sent in to destroy hard drives owned by the Guardian, the newspaper's editor has revealed . Mr Rusbridger said dialogue with . officials started around two months ago, before their 'mood toughened' around a month ago, when he claims he 'received a phone call from the . centre of government telling me: 'You've had your fun. Now we want the . stuff back'.' He revealed he held a series of meetings with 'shadowy Whitehall figures', in which he was asked to destroy all Edward Snowden related material. Eventually, he said, officials threatened legal action, and that's when the editor allowed British agents into his basement. GCHQ Headquarters in Chelternham. The newspaper editor said two GCHQ security experts oversaw the process in the London basement . He adds that he told the official he intended to publish the material abroad, should the government seek to stifle them using legal routes, before hardware was destroyed at the newspapers basement. 'And so one of the more bizarre moments in the Guardian's long history occurred - with two GCHQ security experts overseeing the destruction of hard drives in the Guardian's basement just to make sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal which could possibly be of any interest to passing Chinese agents. ""We can call off the black helicopters"" joked one as we swept up the remains of a MacBook Pro.' The revelations come a day after David .

Terrorism Act 2000. Today Theresa May revealed she was briefed in advance of the possible detention of Mr Miranda at Heathrow Airport. But the Home Secretary said that it was not for her to tell the police who they should or should not stop at ports, or who they should arrest. She said: 'If it is believed that somebody has in their possession highly sensitive stolen information which could help terrorists, which could lead to a loss of lives, then it is right that the police act and that is what the law enables them to do.'

Mr Rusbridger warns 'it may not be long before it will be impossible for journalists to have confidential sources'. However, he points out that the Guardian will continue to make use of reporting from other, more 'permissive legal environments'. Rusbridger said the destruction was the culmination of weeks of pressure on the Guardian by British officials. It was not clear exactly when the . incident occurred. Rusbridger gave a vague timeline, suggesting that it happened within the past month or so. Ordeal: Glenn Greenwald (left) walks with his partner David Miranda (right) through Rio de Janeiro Airport .

The Guardian has been forced to succumb to legal pressure in the past - Sarah Tisdall, a young Foreign Office clerk, was sent to prison for leaking details of 1983 cruise missile deployment plans to the newspaper. She anonymously sent The Guardian photocopied documents detailing when American cruise missile nuclear weapons would be arriving in the United Kingdom. Despite a legal battle the newspaper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents, which were identified as coming from an FCO photocopying machine, and ultimately identifying Sarah Tisdall.","Claimed a pair of .

Bitten: Richard Flora, 76, pictured with a young relative, was bitten by an Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake on Thursday out the front of his daughter's home in Hobe Sound, Florida . 'We knew something was not right. He was having all the symptoms... a rapid heart rate, sweating, and vomiting,' Flora's daughter, Ellen Wilson, said of her father's reaction to the bite. The elderly man was in the late stages of Alzheimer's and hated the condition, which affects a person's memory, thinking and behavior and gets worse over time, Wilson said.

The firm does this by tracking a consumer's credit card details - although it says their identity remains secret. Scroll down for video . Mastercard has admitted it tracks its customers transaction so that it can sell data to advertisers about their spending habits - but claims the system never reveals their personal details. However, it refuses to reveal how the system works, and a privacy group today accused the firm of 'treating details of our personal behaviour like their own property.' 'The foundation of all of our solutions is transaction data,' Susan Grossman, senior vice president at MasterCard Advisors Media Solutions Group said in a presentation seen by MailOnline. When a consumer swipes a credit card . in a store, she says MasterCard’s data-packaging division receives . information about the date, time, amount and merchant. The firm tracks billions of anonymous . transactions from customers, which it then aggregates into small . segments which comprise of similar transactions. This allows the firm to sell details of these very specific 'segments' of data to advertisers.

'We recognise that consumers entrust us with their information so it is of the utmost importance that we ensure no individual or personally identifiable information is used in our media solutions product,' she said. Ms Grossman said the company’s main clients for much of their history had been their issuing banks and for them MasterCard did a significant amount of statistical modelling and predictive modelling and found that those propensity models were application to companies other than banks, such as media. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'If this data has value, then it should be up to Mastercard to ask customers for permission to use their information and offer consumers something in return. 'Instead they are treating details of our personal behaviour like their own property to be bundled up and sold on without any regard to what customers might want. The slides reveal that Mastercard collects transaction from its customer to use to target advertisments at them . 'Have Mastercard made any effort to seek customer’s consent for processing their shopping habits and selling it on? How do consumers opt out?

The Queen was dragged into an extraordinary constitutional row last night as the Governor-General and Prime Minister of a tiny Pacific island nation tried to sack one another. The Prime Minister of Tuvalu, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge toured last year, has despatched a letter to the Queen asking her to support his attempts to remove the Governor-General from office. As the nation’s flag, with the British emblem in the corner, fluttered over the Parliament building, Governor-General Iakoba Italeli and Prime Minister Willy Telavi, fired angry words at one another as each demanded that the other step down. Row: Governor-General Iakoba Italeli (left) and Prime Minister Willy Telavi (right) have both tried to make the other step down . The tit-for-tat row erupted in the capital, Funafuti, after Mr Telavi refused to allow parliament to debate a no-confidence motion in his government, which has ruled since late 2010. Monarch: The Queen is still the head of state in Tuvalu . The Governor-General ordered the Prime Minister to remove himself from office, but Mr Telavi was hearing nothing of it. Instead he fired off a letter to Buckingham Palace, informing the Queen that it was his intention to dismiss the Governor-General. ‘It’s is a very complex and confusing constitutional crisis that we’re facing,’ said a spokesperson for the Governor-General who officiates over one of the last outposts of the Commonwealth. He said the Queen, who remains Tuvalu’s head of state despite the country of 10,000 gaining independence from Britain in 1978, had not yet given any indication whether she accepts the dismissal of the Governor-General. ‘Until we hear whether the Prime Minister’s attempt to remove him has been confirmed by Her Majesty he remains in office,’ said the spokesman. Throwing a political spanner into the works is opposition leader Mr Enele Sopoaga, who told Radio New Zealand International that he was standing in as caretaker Prime Minister and he intended to oversee a no-confidence vote in Mr Telavi’s government. The 15-seat parliament is expected to . meet next Tuesday and decide who should be the new Prime Minister - and . if that happens it is likely the Queen will be excused from being drawn . into the row.

For two years Florida has been infested with Giant African Land Snails, and in order to combat the pest they are now bringing in a secret weapon. Soon the state will employ trained Labrador retrievers to fight the infestation of the snails, one of the world's most destructive invasive species. The snails, which were spotted in the Miami area two years ago can grow as big as rats and eat both plants and building materials such as stucco and plaster. Bear is one of the Labrador retrievers being trained to detect the Giant African Land Snails in Florida . 'We see a lot of strange things in Florida and this one makes the top of the list,' Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam told Reuters. 'It is a very serious pest.' Up to this point the state has collected 128,000 snails, the news organization reports. The aggressive campaign has cost the state $6 million dollars so far. Officials believe the destructive snail population may have been introduced into the area by the local Santeria religious group, who use the insects in their rituals. Giant African Land Snails currently infesting Miami, can grow to be as big as rats . In addition to harming plants, the snails pose a potential threat to humans as they can carry a parasitic rat lungworm that can induce meningitis, Reuters reports. However state officials say that no such case have been reported in the United States. Before the dog cavalry was brought in, efforts to find and exterminate the snails involved a team of 45 people who combed the grown in search of the slimy land pests. The teams used chemical treatments and traps in order to find the snails. Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam holds a Giant African Land Snail shell at a news conference about the state's efforts to eradicate the population . The state is now bringing in the dogs to aid this effort . 'They're very good at detecting the Giant African Land Snail,'Richard Gaskalla the head of plant industry at the Florida Agriculture Department told Reuters.. 'So we're building four-legged technology into this program as quickly as we can.' The dogs are expected to aid the eradication efforts by sniffing out the snails. The Giant African Land Snail gives off a strong smell which the dogs are being trained to detect. The giant snails were first spotted in Florida two years ago and can do agricultural and structural damage . The dogs are trained over a three month period, and so far three Labradors are going through the program. At this time the agriculture department believes that this infestation is contained to the local Miami area. Gaskalla told Reuters that so far the state's efforts have been successful as there is a marked drop in population number since they were first discovered. 'The number of detections this last year were in the thousands; now they are down to around 200 to 300 a week,' he said.","To stop the invasion of Giant African Land Snails in Florida, the government is bringing in Labrador retrievers .

A news reporter for local TV station WJZ stands outside the tavern beside the spot where the bomb landed . Owner Darlene Hurley said a customer came in from outside saying he thought a car in the parking lot was on fire. After going outside to find most of the vehicles in the carpark covered in dust and stones and a 3-foot deep hole, she called 911. Police officers dug in the hole and when they spotted the fins of the device, they called in the fire marshal's bomb squad. Bomb technicians determined that it was a practice aerial bomb and the device was turned over to the National Guard, the fire marshal's office said.

A teenager has a rare genetic condition that means even a yawn can cause one of her arms or legs to dislocate. Phoebe Bruce, 17, from Hawarden, can be left screaming in agony up to eighteen times a day. She has a condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome which means her collagen is too weak to hold her limbs in place. Every day of her young life, she has suffered at least one dislocation. But earlier this year the attacks increased dramatically and now she is trapped in a daily nightmare of being rushed back and forth to A&E - sometimes waiting up to seven hours to be seen at a time and at other times having paramedics called to her home. Phoebe Bruce is in agony from at least one dislocation a day - and her condition is worsening . Her desperate parents Yvonne and Richard have been waiting a month for health bosses to decide whether to agree to fund treatment at a specialist private hospital in London. Because she lives in Wales, it is up to the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee to decide if she gets the money. In one of her worst attacks, the family tried to go to the Lake District for a holiday and Phoebe suffered 18 dislocations in one episode. 'I can put my other limbs back in,' she said. 'But my arms are coming out every day and they are the ones that get stuck out - there’s no way I can move them. 'Anyone with my condition - it’s a coping thing - and you just have to try and deal with it, knowing that you are going to have multiple dislocations in a day.' Brave Phoebe inherited the condition from her father Richard, who has the same genetic disorder, but in a much milder form. She told how the condition, diagnosed a few months after birth, has led to her being all but confined to her own home. 'I have always had at least one dislocation a day in my life, it is very painful,' she said. 'It’s as painful as a normal person getting a dislocation, but my limbs will also twist,' she said. 'But it has been getting more and more each day. I have a wheelchair to take me round school and teaching assistants with me. 'We recently went to Asda for a day trip, but then my shoulder and back went, and I couldn’t move, I was stuck in the middle of Asda and they had to call an ambulance and I ended up in A&E. But the paramedics are fantastic with me. They all know me.' Phoebe, a talented artist, is trying to study for her A levels in art, psychology and media, but has been hindered by having her arms in casts for a year. But she has still managed to get two AS levels in Art and Media. Phoebe with her parents Yvonne and Richard who are trying to get her treatment in London . Phoebe’s mother Yvonne first raised the question of whether she could get specialist treatment at the Hypermobility Unit at St John’s and St Elizabeth’s, about four months ago. Phoebe is currently being treated at Alder Hey in Liverpool. Her case was referred to the WHSSC a month ago as no NHS trust can make a financial decision about a Welsh patient. Her family have been counting the days ever since - with a decision expected tomorrow they are pleading with NHS bosses to help change her life. Yvonne said: 'We have been told this is the most extreme case they have seen. The process for funding has been too slow. It’s taken a long time. It seems to have gone round in circles. 'We have been told they would accept her at the London hospital, but because she lived in Wales, she couldn’t be funded from England. The clinic in London will asses her to see what can be done, and they can train her to put her joints in herself, and pain management. 'It’s terrible witnessing your daughter in such pain. The school call the ambulance virtually every day because she has dislocations. 'We are always at A&E, and me and Richard take it in turns to be on duty to take her to the hospital so we can keep our jobs going. I work at Asda and Richard at Airbus, and they have been very understanding. 'With Phoebe, for her it’s like having a baby every day with the pain she is going through.' There are also talks about the possibility of pioneering surgery on Phoebe to put in artificial strengthening into her limbs. But there are risks. Her aunt Barbara Sheady has also been very supportive when her sister Yvonne has been in tears. Barbara said: 'You wouldn’t treat a dog like that. Unfortunately Phoebe gets taken to theatre, sedated and joints reconnected and sent home often to be readmitted within hours. 'The doctors who treat her do not know what to do, her use of morphine is having an effect on her kidneys, and malnutrition due to loss of appetite. 'Phoebe has a consultant doctor in Alder Hey childrens hospital who has monitored her condition and has recently stated it is the severest case he has come across in UK.' An Alder Hey spokeswoman said they couldn’t comment on individual cases. The Welsh Government and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it would be up to the WHSSC. Mark Isherwood AM, who has looked into their case, said: 'This is a young woman suffering immense pain and dealing with a damaging condition. I just hope they make right the decision on Thursday.' Nobody was available from the WHSSC to comment yesterday. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders. It is caused by a defect in the body’s manufacture of the protein collagen.Collagen is often referred to as “glue” in connective tissue and helps to resist deformation in the body. It plays a very significant role in the skin, joints, muscles, ligaments, blood vessels and visceral organs. Abnormal collagen leads to increased elasticity within these structures which can lead to limbs dislocating. Depending on the individual, the severity of the disorder, it can vary from mild to life-threatening.  There is no cure, and treatment is broadly supportive. Physical therapy, bracing, and corrective surgery may help with the frequent injuries and pain that tend to develop in certain types of EDS. The syndrome is named after two doctors, Edvard Ehlers of Denmark, and Henri-Alexandre Danlos of France, who identified it at the turn of the 20th century. The exact incidence is not known, but is estimated at 1 in 5000, however, research is showing it is more common.","Phoebe Bruce has a genetic condition that means her collagen is too weak to hold her limbs in place .

Shane Rattenbury had a close encounter with a kangaroo during his morning jog and came away with deep scratches and bruising . An Australian politician has been attacked by a kangaroo on his morning jog. Shane Rattenbury, a minister in the Australian Capital Territory government, almost collided with the eastern grey kangaroo, which was grazing on a front lawn in a Canberra suburb. 'We both got a nasty fright, and of course when kangaroos are startled, they lash out,' Mr Rattenbury said. 'As the kangaroo sought to escape, it landed on me, and its claws dug into my leg.' Mr Rattenbury, 41, says the 4ft 7in kangaroo left him with two deep scratches to his left leg and bruising to his right leg. Moments later, a passer-by spotted the minister on the ground in Ainslie and drove him home. He was taken to hospital and given a tetanus shot. 'The nurse who treated me had treated someone before who had been scratched by a kangaroo and ended up with a very bad infection,' he said. 'So she was quite keen to give it a good clean-out.' Mr Rattenbury arrived at the ACT parliament yesterday three hours after his encounter, and found most of his colleagues were more concerned about the kangaroo's welfare than his. 'I can assure people that the kangaroo is fine,' he said. 'It was last seen hopping off into the distance quite comfortably.' He posted a picture of his injuries to his Twitter page and assured his followers that the mugger had not made off with his wallet or watch. Mr Rattenbury, who was running as part of his triathlon training, posted a picture of the scratches on Twitter . Kangaroos are among Australia's most loved native species, featuring alongside an emu on the nation's coat of arms. But there are so many kangaroos around Canberra that the ACT government maintains a controversial culling program to contain them. Mr Rattenbury, who is a member of the Greens party, said he accepts the scientific evidence that kangaroo numbers have to be controlled around Canberra. 'Without a predator, kangaroos have . increased their abundance and have a detrimental impact on the rest of . the ecosystem,' he said. 'The Greens have not opposed that cull. 'I . really enjoy seeing kangaroos and we're very lucky in Canberra to have . them as part of our neighbourhoods, but I usually prefer to keep them at . a bit more of a distance than this,' he said. Mr Rattenbury told CNN the encounter had not put him off running and he intended to be out the next day to continue with his triathlon training. Kangaroos . rarely harm people, although in 2009 one jumped through a bedroom . window of a Canberra home late at night and terrorised a family before a . householder wrestled it out the front door. The 4ft 7in eastern grey kangaroo skipped away unhurt from the collision (file photo) Wildlife veterinarian Karen Vickers said more kangaroos were likely to venture deeper into Canberra suburbs in search of watered lawns to feed in the drier months ahead and that people should be wary. 'It sounds like they startled each other and Shane came off worse,' she told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. 'They're really not out to get us.'","Shane Rattenbury collided with the 4ft 7in kangaroo in a Canberra suburb .

This angler will be enjoying seafood suppers for weeks after landing an enormous 8ft halibut big enough to make 400 portions of fish and chips. It took Christian Johannsen, 45, and two other men almost five hours to reel in the mighty 428lb catch in the Barents Sea off Norway, which Mr Johannsen described as being 'the size of a door'. As he left for his latest angling trip the German banker's wife had told him to be sure to bring home a fish supper, said Mr Johannsen. Catch of the day: German fisherman Christian Johannsen spent five hours reeling in the huge halibut, which he described as being 'the size of a door' Her husband, from North Friesland near Hamburg, went on to haul in one of the biggest halibuts on record. 'I thought my hook had struck the ground at first because there was so much resistance,' Mr Johannsen said. 'I . tried to dislodge it and after a few seconds I realised the ground was . moving. We had to start the engine because it started swimming away. 'After about 20 minutes it tired and slowed down and that's when the hard work started. 'My . rod was bent at 90 degrees and I had to work for over four hours to . bring it to the surface. By that time my arms were burning and I was . covered in sweat. 'When it came to the surface it was about the size of a door.' Monster: Banker Christian Johannsen's huge halibut was so vast it yielded 400 filleted portions . After hauling the monster fish on . board with ropes, all three men had to stand on one side of the boat to . prevent it from lurching beneath the weight of the halibut. 'We all had to stand on one side of the boat to keep it balanced,' he said. Once they reached dry land, the halibut was weighed and measured before being carved up into about 400 filleted portions and distributed. A halibut main course in a quality fish restaurant could cost as much as £25 - meaning Mr Johannsen's haul could have realised a value of around £10,000. But because the fish was . caught in the Barents Sea off Norway, Mr Johannsen was only . allowed to take home or export a maximum of 15kg - around 30 portions. Impressive haul: Weighing a massive 428lbs, the halibut is one of the biggest ever caught by a fisherman . He donated most of the rest to the man who rented him the 19ft fishing boat. 'My wife's three favourite fish are halibut, halibut and halibut and she wanted me to bring some back with me. 'I think we will be eating halibut for a long time to come,' Mr Johannsen said. The current halibut records stands at 482lbs 13ozs, landed by another German angler, Gunther Hansel, off Norway in 2009. Atlantic halibut are among the largest bony fish in the world. Their native habitat is the northern Atlantic, from Greenland to the Barents Sea and as far south as the Bay of Biscay. They can reach up to 15ft in length and weigh up to 700lbs and can live for 50 years.","Banker Christian Johannsen, 45, landed 428lb beast of coast of Norway .

A Chocalatier forced by soaring costs to shut his flagship shop has warned that the British high street is almost dead. Simon Dunn, whose store was in Chancellor George Osborne’s constituency, says small businesses are being forced out as their profits are squeezed. He was left with £100 for himself ‘in a good week’ after paying rent, business rates and wages, leading him to warn: ‘Before long all that will be left on the British high street is Tesco, Costa and charity shops – it’s just impossible for people like me to keep our heads above the water.’ Simon Dunn, a chocolatier, has had to shut his shop in Wilmslow, Cheshire, because it became too expensive to run and ate up all of his takings . Mr Dunn taped a goodbye letter to the shop window in Wilmslow, Cheshire, to explain to customers how he had nothing left once he'd covered his business costs . ‘I’m afraid independent traders on the high street just don’t have a chance these days in this tough current economic climate. ‘My shop was in George Osborne’s constituency [Tatton]. He ought to know the importance of independent businesses and try to do something to help us. It’s the rising cost of everything that is affecting business owners like me. ‘The sad part of it is that we’re not the only business that’s having to do this. It’s a national problem that is affecting every high street. 'On a good week we were left with £100 a week profit and it was just not worth it. There seems to be no incentive to operate as an independent on the high street these days. ‘I have to turn over a certain amount just to keep moving, but if I go over that amount suddenly I find myself in a position where I can be taxed more. It’s as though business owners are punished for being successful.’ The store, which opened in 2007, was one of seven run by Mr Dunn and his family in the North West, with a further franchise in Bridport, Dorset. His daughter, Camilla, 25, runs one branch and his brother Gary another, while his son Oliver, 28, organises chocolate parties in customers’ homes. 'The Wilmslow shop was the busiest and all of our customers were regulars,’ said Mr Dunn, who lives with his wife Anne, 52, in Disley, Cheshire. ‘We were always busy, and to the outsider looking in the business was doing great. ‘Sir Alex Ferguson and his wife were regular customers as were a lot of footballers and Coronation Street stars. ‘When the recession started taking hold we soon started to notice the difference. Chocolate prices have more than doubled since we opened the shop. ‘On top of that I had to pay £5.50 a day just to park the car. People were so shocked when they read the letter but people don’t realise how costly things can be.’ Mr Dunn wrote that the closure might have come as a shock because the shop was always busy . Mr Dunn, whose Wilmslow shop was inside George Osborne's constituency, said the Chancellor should do more to help independent retailers . He will now concentrate on the business’s online operation. Simon Carr, vice chairman of Wilmslow . Business Group, said: ‘It is a huge loss to see an independent retailer . struggling in this way and that they have to make the decision to pull . out of the town.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Small businesses are the backbone of the British economy. ‘We know for many that times have been tough. The Government has focused what help we can give on small businesses.’ Mr Dunn said his customers were 'furious' and couldn't believe that the shop had to close .

A British warship fired on and killed three whales during the Falklands War after mistaking them for enemy submarines. The startling revelation is contained within new eyewitness accounts of the tense days aboard anti-submarine frigate HMS Brilliant during the 1982 conflict in the southern seas. Radar on the Royal Navy ship was unable to distinguish between attacking 'Wolf Packs' of subs and a pod of whales. In one instance, two of the mammals were killed by torpedoes and the third was attacked by one of the ship’s helicopters. Contact: HMS Brilliant, a Type 22 frigate of the Royal Navy, killed three whales after mistaking them for enemy submarines while engaged in the Falklands War, it has emerged . Engineer Ginge Offord, whose account was written five years ago and only just been published on www.hmsbrilliant.com - a site dedicated to recording the testimony of crew for posterity. In an extract from his experience of . the Falklands War, he wrote: 'During the day we went to Action Stations a . number of times as we were receiving reports of enemy aircraft taking . off from their bases on the mainland. They were chased off by our CAP (combat air patrol). 'Searches and attacks went on until . darkness, when we broke off and headed back to the main group. 'Our tally . for the day was a pair of whales. Sadly, their signature on sonar is . similar to that of a submarine. The torpedo Petty Officer gained the . sobriquet ""Wolf Pack"".' Vital role: HMS Brilliant was sent to the South Atlantic to protect HMS Invincible, pictured, one of Britain's two aircraft carriers, from Argentinian attack . Brilliant had been deployed to the South Atlantic to protect one of Britain's two aircraft carriers from Argentinian submarine and missile attack. The brush with whales was not a rare occurrence, judging by the testimony of HMS Brilliant's Captain John Francis Coward. Recollection on instance, he wrote: . 'One night Brilliant went chasing submarines, which proved rather less . than successful. I had received a typical Woodward signal: ""An aircraft . has reported sighting a submarine twenty miles north of Port Stanley. Go . find him and bring me back his hat."" 'I knew if we found him he'd be on the bottom and the whole place was littered with old whaling ships. 'We . would find something, ping on it and it would look about the size of a . small submarine, so we'd fly a helicopter with a magnetic detector over . it and, yes, it would say it's metal. But I didn't have enough bombs to . cover each wreck, and very few helicopters with metal detectors on them. 'The place was also . full of whales, which gave enormous echoes on the sonar. Every so often a . whale would come up, give a little blow, and a flock of seagulls would . gather round, appearing as a quick flash on the radar. Target: The signature of the whales picked up on HMS Brilliant's radar gave the crew the impression they were enemy submarines. (Stock picture) 'Everybody would say, ""Christ, it must be a submarine,"" and we launched a few torpedoes at things like that. 'All in all, it was a total frustration but, looking back, I've a feeling that one of those wrecks was the San Luis and I think that eventually the analysis boys will confirm it.' However, whales were not a totally benign presence in the water. Within the accounts from crew, one member recalls how the ship sustained damaged after colliding with one of the enormous mammals. He noted: 'After about twelve months we had the misfortune to collide with a whale, which broke away some of the steel plates that covered the rudder. After a few more convoys some more of the plates came away, so it was back to UK for repairs and another refit, this time in Chatham dockyard.'

One tweet read: 'This . causes me so much shame' while another sarcastically said that while .

Ms Hart, from Doniphan, had just started a job as a pharmacy technician when she had her first Powerball win of $500 on Wednesday last week. Lucky streak: Mary Jane Hart won the lottery twice, including one win of $1 million . When she went to work at Hartland Pit Stop on Saturday, the part-time cashier sold herself a second ticket because the jackpot had reached a record amount. Her winning formula came from picking the numbers of her favorite NASCAR drivers, and she plans on watching a lot more races now that she is a millionaire. 'I've always wanted to win a jackpot so that I could go to way more NASCAR races than I go to [now], which is a lot,' she told Kait8. While the winner of the record Powerball jackpot of $590 million bought their ticket in Florida, Missouri was able to claim two $1 million winners in Saturday's historic draw. In Zephyrhills, where the winning ticket was bought at a Publix supermarket, the town is waiting for the winner to come forward. The winner is believed to be a 26-year-old single mother. Celebration: Mary Jane Hart with her co-workers at the Hartland Pit Shop where she says she will still work . The winner can choose to take the annuity or a lump sum of $370,896,780.54. The lottery withholds 25 percent in tax, but with no state tax in Florida, the winner could claim $278 million, according to ABC News. Ms Hart did not bother to check her numbers until a friend told her one of the winning tickets had been bought at her place of work. 'Someone had called me and told me that . there was a winning ticket [at Hartland Pit Stop],' she said. 'So I . went to the convenience store at Poplar Bluff and it said I was a . winner.' The cashier had matched all of the numbers except for the powerball - winning herself $1 million. Winning touch: Mary Jane Hart sold her self the winning ticket at the store where she works . 'It couldn't happen to a better person,' Sara Barfield, who also works at the store, said. 'I'm glad to see it went to somebody deserving.' But despite her winnings, Ms Hart says she will continue to work and will still play the lottery each week. '[My new boss] asked me I might be quitting, and I said no,' she said. As well as some trips to watch Nascar racing, Ms Hart will use her winnings to help her son and pay for a trip to Hawaii. 'That's a lifelong dream,' she said. 'I think I can do that now.' The estimated jackpot for the next Powerball draw is currently $40 million.","Double win on lottery came on same week Missouri woman started new job .

Clocking up the cash: The iconic Big Ben clock could be hired out to film-makers as a film set . Film directors could be invited to shoot inside the Big Ben clock tower to turn Parliament into a moneyspinner. MPs want to charge production companies to gain access to the landmark as part of plans to raise an extra £3million a year by making the Palace of Westminster ‘operate more commercially as a visitor attraction’. The idea comes after proposals to charge visitors to climb the tower, renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen after the Diamond Jubilee, were dropped. It raises the possibility of the Big Ben bell and the spiral staircase leading up to it being used as the centrepiece of an action movie. The clock has played a central role in many films – most notably the 1978 version of the Thirty Nine Steps, in which the hero is seen hanging from its hands – but cameras are not usually allowed inside the tower itself. Other suggestions, unveiled in a report by the House of Commons finance and services committee, include hiring out some of the Commons’ most opulent dining rooms. There are plans to charge visitors for ‘premium tours’ of Westminster Hall, the most ancient part of Parliament. But the idea of using the home of British democracy as a cash cow could prove controversial. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who led the campaign against charging for entry to the tower, said: ‘Parliament should be for the people, and not become a theme park. ‘This is the greatest Parliament in the world, in one of the oldest democracies in the world. 'It should not be a plaything for film moguls and big business trying to make a quick buck.’ Iconic: The clock has already featured in many films and TV programmes. Here actor Matt Smith and actress Jenna-Louise Coleman are pictured filming scenes for TV show Doctor Who by Big Ben . It comes as the Speaker considers a separate report on possible plans for vacating the Houses of Parliament while essential repairs are carried out. Under the plans, MPs could be forced to meet in the nearby Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre after the election, while Lords could have to sit in Church House. In the meantime, however, MPs are looking at ways to make more money out of the international fame of the Houses of Parliament. They have a target of an extra £3million in revenue a year by 2015. The committee’s report said: ‘For many years the House has carried out revenue raising activities notably through catering, retail and visitor services. 'These have been expanding in recent years, for example through Saturday opening for visitors. ‘The House of Commons Commission agreed that there should be a clearer separation between Parliament as a working body and Parliament as a visitor attraction and agreed that the financial plans should be based on developing a number of activities for the House to operate more commercially as a visitor attraction.’ However, the report does suggest charging for tours of Westminster Hall, where King Charles I was convicted of treason and members of the Royal Family lie in state. They are considering a ‘tiered visitor admission offer including a short tour of Westminster Hall, an audio-guided tour and a premium tour with a guide’. Starring role: The clock has played a central role in many films ¿ most notably the 1978 version of the Thirty Nine Steps, in which the hero is seen hanging from its hands . Another idea is to allow businesses and wealthy individuals to hire out some of Parliament’s most exclusive rooms for parties and other events ‘on an experimental basis for two years on a limited number of occasions when they are not expected to be used by members’. Among them is the Atrium, the large hall in Portcullis House, where many MPs have their office. The Atrium hit the headlines earlier this year when it emerged that 12 fig trees there cost taxpayers thousands of pounds a year. MPs could also open up the many dining rooms in the Palace with exclusive views across the Thames; while another option is the Terrace Pavilion, a marquee standing on the terrace by the river. Labour MP John Mann said: ‘If these plans can make a profit for the taxpayer, I’m all in favour. 'Let’s follow the example of the Queen with Buckingham Palace and make money out of this place. ‘Why not go further, and set up the House of Lords chamber as a restaurant and tea room for tourists.’ Last night the Speaker received a report on possible plans for vacating the Houses of Parliament while repairs are carried out. The most likely option are the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre near Westminster Abbey for MPs and Church House for peers. Other more drastic options are being considered, including creating an entirely new parliament building in Covent Garden. The idea has been proposed amid the soaring bill for repairing the Grade I listed Palace of Westminster, which is suffering from chronic subsidence, electrical problems, and various other safety hazards. The work, which will have to start shortly after the next General Election, is expected to cost taxpayers more than £3 billion.","MPs are looking at ways to make more money out of the international fame of the Houses of Parliament .

Chinese villagers have defended their tradition of hanging a live bull from a tree until it dies as part of a ritual to bring them luck and a bumper harvest. The 'cow-hanging ceremony' has been carried out by the minority Dong people of southern China for almost 500 years and now attracts hundreds of tourists. The tradition in Baojiang village, Guangxi Zhuang region, is supposed to bring good weather and a full harvest, as well as peace and prosperity. Barbaric: The bull is hanged from a tree as part of a traditional Dong festival to bring good luck at harvest . Horrifying: In front of families and young children the bull is hauled up and hanged until it dies . Residents parade the bull around the area, where it supposedly collects bad luck.

A Pennsylvania hospital will soon become the first to offer an inpatient detox program for those addicted to the internet. Bradford Regional Medical Center in Bradford, Pennsylvania will open its doors September 9 to those whose lives have spiraled out of control thanks to their gaming or web surfing habits. The program will offer a voluntary, 10-day stint and was created by experts in other, more traditional addictions like alcohol or drugs. Problematic? For those whose internet use veers into addiction territory, a Pennsylvania hospital now offers a $14,000, 10-day 'digital detox' program . ‘[Internet addiction] is a problem in this country that can be more pervasive than alcoholism,’ Dr. Kimberly Young, the psychologist who founded the non-profit program, told Fox News. ‘The Internet is free, legal and fat free,’ she said. In the hospital wing already occupied by patients with addictions of other sorts, groups of four internet addicts will take classes and take part in the sort of group therapy traditionally reserved for chemical addicts. They will be people like Kevin Roberts, a 44-year-old beat his 12 hour per day video gaming habit and wrote Cyber Junkie: Escape the Gaming and Internet Trap. Counterpoint: US psychiatrist and author, Allen Frances says an official diagnosis for internet addiction isn't 'ready for primetime' and warns that such diagnoses could be frivolous or unhelpful . Researchers at the University of Kentucky say that anywhere from .3 and 38 percent of Americans are likely addicted to the internet. They point to some symptoms, not unlike those of more traditional addictions, that one should look for: . In it, Roberts describes classic addiction symptoms. ‘Like most addicts, I went through a series of self-deception,’ he said. Meanwhile, Young warns that there’s a difference between an addiction and a commonplace over dependence on the internet. But the price tag of the program should be prohibitive enough to keep away everyone but the most desperate of internet addicts. A stay at the digital detox will cost around $14,000 and insurance won’t cover it. Despite its high cost, some experts worry that internet addiction in general isn’t even real. ‘If we can be addicted to gambling and the Internet, why not also include addictions to shopping, exercise, sex, work, golf, sunbathing, model railroading, you name it,’ wrote Duke University psychiatrist Dr. Allen Frances in a Huffington Post op-ed. Dr, Frances was the chairman of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV. In the newer iteration of the psychological diagnosis bible, ‘gaming disorder’ was listed among the potential diagnoses that require further research before they become listed.

An estimated 90 people were injured, the . majority of whom were children, and the school’s male head teacher was . killed in the blast. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Devastation: Wounded Iraqi children are treated at a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Dohuk. Bombers detonated explosives-rigged vehicles at a police station and a primary school . Attack: 14 children were killed and 90 people were wounded in the attack near the Syrian border . Two policemen were also killed. It is the latest in a relentless wave of killing in recent months - Iraq's deadliest outburst of violence since 2008. The mounting death tolls are raising fears that the country is falling back into the spiral of fighting that brought it to the edge of civil war in the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. The Shiite Turkomen village, largely populated by people descended from central Asia, has a population of just 200. The area around the stricken village has long been a hotbed for hard-to-rout Sunni insurgents and a corridor for extremist fighters arriving from nearby Syria. Mayor of local town Tel Afar, Abdul Aal al-Obeidi, said: ‘It’s a tragedy. These innocent children were here to study. ‘What sins did these children commit? We and Iraq are plagued by Al Qaeda.’ Abdul Aal al-Obeidi, mayor of nearby Tel Afar, said: 'It's a tragedy.

There are just 200 inhabitants of the Turkomen village were children were left scrambling for their lives . There was chaos in the hospital as medics rushed to care for the injured while bombs went off elsewhere . Today, another suicide bomber - this time on foot - blew himself up as Shiite pilgrims walked through the largely Sunni neighborhood of Waziriyah in the north of the Iraqi capital. At least 12 people were killed and 23 wounded in that attack, according to police and hospital officials. The Shiite pilgrims were making their way to a golden-domed shrine in northern Baghdad where two revered Shiite saints are buried. Tragic: An inconsolable relative sits on the floor next to an injured boy resting since his treatment . The death toll stands at 75 this weekend alone in Iraq's most violent year since 2008, figures show . On Saturday, a suicide bombing in the largely Sunni neighborhood of Azamiyah killed 51. Later today, a bomb hidden in a car park exploded in eastern Baghdad al-Jadidah, a district that has both Sunni and Shiite areas. That blast killed six and wounded 12, according to police and hospital officials. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attacks.

Loqman Mohammed, head of a survivors association, stands amidst the rubble of a building wrecked by bombs in Kurdish Halabja, 160 miles north of Baghdad on September 16 . The United Nations envoy to Iraq urged political, religious and civic leaders to work together to stop the killing. Envoy Nickolay Mladenov said: 'It is their responsibility to ensure that pilgrims can practice their religious duties, that school children can attend their classes, that journalists can exercise their professional duties and that ordinary citizens can live a normal life in an environment free of fear and violence.' United Nations figures released last week showed that at least 979 people, most of them civilians, were killed last month alone.

She had to get a letter from both the school’s chaplain and her Mosque to get permission to wear the head scarf on campus. 'Keep calm and wear a hijab': Student Melona Clark was told she must get written permission from both her chaplain and mosque in order to wear a hijab on Hampton University's campus in Virginia . And now that she has permission, Clark is carrying around the proof wherever she goes. ‘I don’t want to have to go through anything like I went through in the first place,’ Clark told WTKR. It started when Clark got to the front of the ID card line and was told she would not be allowed to have her picture taken.

The latest entrant in the crowded field of dating apps has perhaps the most unique twist of them all – no faces. Launched on both Android and Apple devices during the summer, Twine is banking on people wanting to meet others based on similar interests and not solely on looks.  People can eventually choose to reveal pictures when they’re comfortable. The app has moved away from the tried and true model of picking people to talk to almost solely based on looks, and steers people towards like-minded counterparts. Write caption here . The app feeds off of information in users’ Facebook profiles, and then creates matches through a combination of GPS proximity and interests in common – without revealing pictures of either side of the match. Users then chat with each other and are even prompted with conversation topics, if they aren't as chatty as their match. Eventually, pictures can be revealed to their new soul mate. Billed by developers as an intellectual flirting and dating app, Twine has less than 50,000 downloads in the Google Play store and has not yet cracked the top 50 social/dating apps  in the Apple App Store. Founder Rohit Singal claimed to the Daily Beast that the app has had over 120,000 downloads and one million matches since its debut. ‘Every other dating app is trying to show you a photo and pick people who are good looking,’ Mr Singal told the Daily Beast, explaining that the idea of pairing people based on similar interests was borne from seeing everyday couples interacting. Virtually blind: Users' faces are only revealed when they choose . Though apps like Tinder, which have broken dating down to the level of a board game, have been the rage of late, Mr Singal told the Daily Beast he’s trying to do the opposite. The swipe to like app has ‘become popular because it expedites behavior in real life—we want to connect with attractive people whether the connection’s meaningful or not,’ Mr Singal said. Aside from not showing faces, Twine also limits the number of matches a user can receive, forcing users to deal in quality, not quantity. ‘We understand this is not common in real life. It would require a change in user behavior to accept what we’re doing,’ he told Daily Beast. One statistic that might draw more users to the app is the ration of women to men. There are currently 16 females for every male using the app, according to Mr Singal. Additionally, only a balanced number of women can log in against men at any given time, this is done to level the playing field, the developer explained. If measured against Tinder - which produces two million matches per day – Twine has quite a ways to go. But Twine isn’t after the Tinder crowd.","Went live on both Android and Apple devices this past summer .

The former intelligence worker who was the source of bombshell stories on top secret government snooping programs first approached the Washington Post with his trove of information in early May, the Post's Barton Gellman has reported. But the Post refused to fulfill some of Edward Snowden's specific requests, so Snowden took his information to The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald, who then became the first to publish a story on the leaks. In talks with the Post during the week of May 20, Snowden, 29, had insisted that the newspaper publish within 72 hours the full text of a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation describing PRISM, the surveillance program that collected Internet data from major Silicon Valley companies. Scroll down for video . Whistleblower: Edward Snowden first approached the Washington Post with his leaks about government surveillance programs in early May . 'I told him we would not make any guarantee about what we published or when,' Gellman reported, to which Snowden replied: 'I regret that we weren't able to keep this project unilateral.' That's when Gellman says Snowden, a former NSA analyst and Booz Allen Hamilton employee, contacted The Guardian and began working with Greenwald. The Post broke the story on PRISM two weeks later, on Thursday, after consulting with government officials about the potential harm to national security of publishing the information. The newspaper eventually reprinted only four of the 41 PRISM PowerPoint slides. The Post's article came just one day . after The Guardian broke its story on Snowden's leaks about the National . Security Administration's monitoring of Verizon customers' call data. Less than a week later, Snowden, who . referred to himself by the codename 'Verax' in correspondence with . reporters, has revealed his identity in an exclusive interview with . Greenwald from a Hong Kong hotel room where he is hiding out to avoid . prosecution by the U.S. government. Snowden took his information to Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald (pictured) when the Post would not comply with some of his demands . 'I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions,' Snowden told The Guardian on Sunday. 'I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law, unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant.' Hong Kong has an extradition treaty with the U.S. Snowden says he is planning to apply for asylum, possibly in Iceland, to avoid prosecution for the leaks. He said he had to go public because he could not 'allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building.' Snowden has been in Hong Kong since May 20 after leaving his job with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, where he had been working for just three months, and claiming that he was seeking treatment for epilepsy.","NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden first approached the Post in early May .

Stephen King has revealed that the sequel to his 1977 classic horror story The Shining will be published on September 24 next year, 36 years after the original book was published. The long-awaited sequel, Doctor . Sleep, follows the story of Danny Torrance, the young boy who survived . the horrific events in the Overlook Hotel. The 64 year-old multi-award winning author made the announcement today on his official . website. Doctor Sleep: Stephen King has revealed that the sequel to The Shining will be published next September . The new book . will focus on Danny, now in adulthood, who works as a hospice worker and helps his patients die painlessly while also fighting a group of psychic vampires. One of King's most loved works, The Shining has sold more than a million copies since it was first published in 1977. Three years later it was adapted into a Hollywood film, which was produced and directed by the late Stanley . Kubrick and starred Jack Nicholson. The Shining told the story of the Torrance family, who moved to the . Overlook Hotel in the Colorado mountains, where father Jack is to act as . caretaker over a long winter. Here's Johnny: Jack Nicholson terrified film fans as a crazed writer in 1980's The Shining . Jack Torrance, a writer who was played by Nicholson in the film, then . becomes possessed by the evil spirits in the hotel and attacks his . family. But the young Danny, whose psychic abilities strengthened the hotel's . ghosts, eventually manages to escape with his mother Wendy. King disclosed the sequel will take up the story when Dan is middle-aged . after 'drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of . despair, alcoholism, and violence'. The book opens with him settling in a New Hampshire town and taking a . job at a nursing home where his 'shining' power helps him comfort the . dying. Known by the local people as 'Doctor Sleep', Dan comes into contact with . Abra Stone, a 12-year-old who has 'the brightest shining ever seen'. He also 'runs afoul of a gang of wandering psychic vampires who feed on people's energy'. Lost in a maze: Nicholson's crazed character comes to a frosty end in the film, but will he back for the prequel . No word yet on when Doctor Sleep will be turned into a movie. King famously disliked the big screen version of The Shining, believing too much of the supernatural element was cut from his book. He said at the time: 'Parts of the film are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fall flat. Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. 'So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others. New blood: Shutter Island screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis has been approached to tackle the daunting prequel . 'What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of The Shining is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should.'

"By . Chris Greenwood and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 19:55 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:44 EST, 23 May 2012 . A Scotland Yard anti-corruption detective and three ex-officers from the Met were arrested today amid claims serving police were pocketing bribes worth up to £20,000 from private investigators. Officers are accused of taking money for information about an inquiry into a politician who defrauded a Nigerian state of more than £150million. The 45-year-old detective constable is being questioned on suspicion of providing information about Nigerian fraudster James Ibori in return for cash. Two private investigators, aged 53 and 58, and another man are being held in connection with providing the money after raids at the London offices of Risc Management Ltd. New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the London Metropolitan Police, where a probe has been launched into claims anti-corruption police took bribes . The Metropolitan Police confirmed today the firm has previously worked with the force. A lawyer told MPs at a Parliamentary inquiry yesterday into the work of private investigators that he had evidence of substantial cash payments made over nine months. Mike Schwarz said invoices from a law firm reveal an undetected case of 'apparent corruption right at the heart of Scotland Yard.' He accused a handful of senior officers responsible for orchestrating the inquiry of also leaking information for cash. If true, the incendiary allegations would ignite a fresh scandal at the London force which remains embroiled in a damaging race row. And they would raise serious questions about links between police and private investigators who want to obtain information to undermine the criminal justice system. The claims centre on a wide-ranging and complex inquiry into the James Ibori, the former governor of Nigeria's Delta State. He was jailed for 13 years last month after admitting he embezzled huge sums to fund a lavish international lifestyle for his family. Keith Vaz MP has said there is growing concern that some private investigators are operating in 'the shadows' of the law . Documents passed to the Commons home affairs committee, and seen by the Daily Mail, appear to show payments were made in return for police information. They include a series of detailed invoices from a London law firm and leading private investigation company RISC Management, which is run by former Scotland Yard detective Keith Hunter. The paperwork indicates that both companies were hired to work for Ibori in 2007 after he discovered he was being investigated for fraud. Yesterday, Mr Schwarz, who represents one of Ibori's co-defendants, said the invoices document payments to 'sources', presumably police officers close to the inquiry. He added: 'The records show about half a dozen payments totalling about £20,000 over a period of eight or nine months... it appears to be inappropriate if not corrupt.' One invoice includes a charge for £5,000 with the note: 'Engaged with source in eliciting information re: forthcoming interview strategy to [be] deployed by police.' Mr Schwarz said he has also seen emails which confirmed contact had been made between the private investigators and detectives. The allegations have been circulating since last year but only surfaced in public yesterday after Mr Schwarz used Parliamentary privilege to make them. His client is Bhadresh Gohil, a London-based solicitor jailed for orchestrating Ibori's vast money-laundering operation. The Met has briefed reporters that there is evidence that casts doubt on the credibility of the evidence against the officers. But following the intervention of Mr Schwarz sources said an investigation into them is being taken more seriously. Keith Vaz, who chairs the home affairs committee, has said there is growing concern that some private investigators are operating in 'the shadows' of the law. The latest inquiry comes in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal and is scrutinising links between private investigators, who include retired police officers, and former colleagues. RISC Management denied all the allegations about the company. Mr Hunter said: 'We pride ourselves on our ability to provide positive solutions and accurate information legitimately.' A Met spokesman said: 'The Met is investigating an allegation that illegal payments were made to police officers for information by a private investigation agency. 'The Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in October 2011 which agreed to supervise a DPS investigation into the allegations.'","One is a serving detective constable while the three ex-officers are believed to be private detectives .

Disturbing footage showing Burmese prostitutes being violently attacked by a group of men has gone viral on the internet, prompting calls for more to be done to help such women. The four-minute clip, which was shown on Thai television news last night, shows a group of defenceless young women being punched and kicked repeatedly by several men. One of the women who is singled out after she tries to call or text someone on her mobile is practically beaten unconscious by the men - who some said were police officers - in what appears to be a closed room. Scroll down for video . The film shows horrifying violence as the men attack the defenceless girls in what seems to be a closed room . The men round on one woman in particular, taking turns to hit her in the head as she cowers before them . The film, which seems to have been shot on a mobile phone and has been viewed on YouTube 40,000 times, is accompanied by a voiceover of Thai newscasters who report that the men are not Thai but Burmese. The newsreaders say the men are sending the women back to Myanmar (Burma) for 'misbehaving'.  However critics in Thailand have suggested the men are Thai, and possibly even police officers. The horrifying footage highlights the plight faced by thousands of young Burmese women who are trafficked to Thailand to work in the sex trade there. An estimated 20,00-30,000 young Burmese women work as prostitutes in Thailand, most of them from ethnic minorities, and 60 per cent of them are thought to be under 18. Women, often from remote, rural locations, are lured into the industry with the promise of high wages, good conditions, and job security. But the reality is very different.  The women are paid very little, and kept as virtual slaves by the often violent pimps.  Clients frequently refuse to use condoms, and disease is rife. The other girls stand by in horror, too terrified to intervene as the men keep coming back to punch the woman . As the woman falls to the floor, barely conscious, her attackers turn to another target to sate their aggression . The men beat and kick their next victim in front of her horrified colleagues as the first girl lies motionless . Rights organisation HumanTrafficking.org says: 'Burmese migrants make up the bulk of migrants in Thailand, often fleeing from military oppression.' It says corruption is still 'widespread' amongst Thai law enforcement personnel, adding: 'There are also reports that Thai police and immigration officials extort money or sex from Burmese citizens detained in Thailand for immigration violations, and sell Burmese people who are unable to pay to labor brokers and sex traffickers. Comments on the YouTube footage called for the men involved to be identified and hanged, with one viewer saying: 'They always pick on the new girls who seem to be the strongest - warning not to run away and to listen. 'It comes with the job - the pimps are the scum of the earth.' Another viewer wrote: 'I hope someone can take serious action and get these men so that they wouldn't torture anyone any more.'","Footage shows women punched, kicked and knocked to the floor by men .

"By . David Wilkes . PUBLISHED: . 07:48 EST, 24 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:43 EST, 24 October 2013 . As a prisoner of war, Gerald Imeson had plenty of time on his hands. But at least as he waited to take part in the Great Escape, the RAF bomber pilot had an elegant timepiece with which to watch the hours tick down. It was a Rolex Oyster 3525 – and it was delivered to him in the Nazis’ notorious Stalag Luft III camp from the watchmaker’s headquarters in Switzerland after he bought it by mail order in 1942 for £170 – the equivalent of £5,000 today. Timeless: The Rolex watch worn by British prisoner of war Flight Lieutenant Gerald Imeson as he helped dig tunnels for the famous 'Great Escape' attempt from the Stalag Luft III camp is to go on sale at auction . During preparations for the . imaginative but ill-fated breakout, Flight Lieutenant Imeson acted as . one of the ‘penguins’ who dispersed the soil dug from the tunnels . through enlarged pockets in their trousers as they exercised in the . compound. But come the . actual escape in March 1944 he was number 172 in the queue of PoWs... and the Germans had discovered what was going on before he made it into . one of the three tunnels. The . story casts light on a surprising marketing enterprise whereby Hans . Wilsdorf, Rolex’s owner, sold the watches on credit to British PoWs . during the Second World War, allowing them to pay when the war was over. He . only made the offer to British officers because they were seen as . honourable gentlemen. They were invited to write to him on postcards . explaining their circumstances and whereabouts and which Rolex they . wanted. Replacement: Swiss watchmaker Rolex had offered all British officer PoWs one of their timepieces to replace the ones seized by the Germans, on condition they pay for them after the war . Honour: The Rolex deal was only made to British officers as they were seen as honourable gentlemen . Survivor: F/Lt Imeson wore the Rolex Oyster Chronograph watch on the hellish forced marches through Germany to evade the advancing Russians in the winter of 1945 . Details of Flt . Lt Imeson’s case came to light yesterday as his watch emerged for sale. The watch is likely to fetch £30,000 when it is auctioned on November 6. He . was captured after his Wellington bomber was hit by flak, following an . attack on Cologne, and crashed into the North Sea in 1941. He . was sent to Stalag Luft III – at Sagan in eastern Germany – the camp . made famous by the 1963 film The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen, . which immortalised the audacious bid for freedom by Allied prisoners . there. Seventy-three of the 76 who did escape were recaptured and 50 of . them executed. RAF . personnel’s military issue watches were often seized by the German . troops who captured them. But once in the PoW camps, some 3,000 are . thought to have taken up Mr Wilsdorf’s offer. Attempt: F/Lt Imeson, fourth from left at Stalag Luft III camp. He was allocated position 172 in the queue of PoWs to escape but never made it into the tunnel as the German guards discovered the break-out . Prized: F/Lt Imeson was made a member of the Goldfish Club, for those who have jumped by parachute from an aircraft into the water, or whose aircraft crashed in the water, in 1943 . Artifact: The reverse side of the prized Goldfish card . Flt Lt Imeson, who had married his wife Lesley only two months before he was captured, remained a PoW for the rest of the war. The . watch survived intact even though he wore it on the forced marches . without adequate food or protection that PoWs endured as the Nazis . evaded the advancing Russians. He was eventually liberated from another . PoW camp in May 1945. After . the war, Flt Lt Imeson, from Overton, Hampshire, returned to his job as . a civil servant with the Air Ministry. He had four children and nine . grandchildren. Treasured: F/Lt Imeson is pictured wearing his treasured timepiece as he relaxes with wife Lesley in the 1980s . Home front: During his time at the camp F/Lt Imeson would have been cheered by the thought of his wife, pictured in 1944, who wrote to him from their home in Kent . He did . not pay for the watch until a couple of years after the war because of . British currency restrictions. He treasured it until he died in 2003 . aged 85 and his last wishes were for the timepiece to one day be sold so . his family could benefit. It is now being auctioned for his grandchildren by Bourne End Auction Rooms in Buckinghamshire. Martin . Perrin, from the auction house, said: ‘Airmen who were kept in Luft . camps were treated quite well and there would have been a gentlemen’s . agreement for the PoWs to order these watches. The model Flt Lt Imeson . chose was one of the top Rolex made at the time.’ Reworking history: The 1963 film The Great Escape was based on real events, and although some characters were fictitious many were based on real people, or amalgams of several of those involved . In the spring of 1943, RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bushell conceived a plan for a major escape from the German Stalag Luft III Camp near Sagan, now Żagań in Poland. With the escape planned for the night of March 24, 1944, the PoWs built three 30ft deep tunnels, named Tom, Dick and Harry, so that if one was discovered by the German guards, they would not suspect that work was underway on two more. Bushell intended to get more than 200 men through the tunnels, each wearing civilian clothes and possessing a complete range of forged papers and escape equipment. To hide the earth dug from the tunnels the prisoners attached pouches of the sand inside their trousers so that as they walked around it would scatter. The prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges made by the sand and were referred to as 'penguins' because of their supposed resemblance to the animal. When the attempt began it was discovered that Harry had come up short and instead of reaching into a nearby forest, the first man in fact emerged just short of the tree line, close to a guard tower. Plans for one man to leave every minute was reduced to 10 per hour. In total 76 men crawled through to initial freedom, but the 77th was spotted by a guard. In the hunt for the entrance one guard Charlie Pilz crawled through the tunnel but after becoming trapped at the other end called for help. The prisoners opened the entrance, revealing the location. Of the escapees 73 were captured, and 50 of them executed. THE HOLLYWOOD FILM . The 1963 film The Great Escape was based on real events, and although some characters were fictitious many were based on real people, or amalgams of several of those involved. The film starred Steve McQueen as Captain Virgil Hilts, James Garner as Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley and Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, and was based on a book of the same name by Paul Brickhill. Contrary to the film no American PoWs were involved in the escape attempt, and there were no escapes by motorcycle or aircraft. Hilts' dash for the border by motorcycle was added by request of McQueen, who did the stunt riding himself except for the final jump.","Timepiece worn by Flight Lieutenant Gerald Imeson at Stalag Luft III camp .

Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette and her sister sparked a feud between the Kennedy family and the heartbroken mother of the Bessettes before the bodies were even found, it was claimed today. Just two days after the plane flown by President John F. Kennedy's son went down in the Atlantic Ocean off Martha's Vineyard in 1999, the Kennedys met with Bessette's mother Ann Freeman and 'bullied her' over the final resting places of the three victims, according to revelations. The accounts of the meeting were taken from JFK Jr.'s cousin - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - and published in the New York Post. They come from RFK Jr.'s diary, which was given to the Post after they were found at his ex-wife Mary Kennedy's house following her suicide in 2012. Tragic: John F. Kennedy Jr. - the son of President Kennedy - is seen here with wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. The couple died when JFK Jr.'s plane crashed in 1999 . Buried at sea: The remains of JFK Jr., his wife Carolyn and her sister Lauren were cremated and scattered at sea during a ceremony aboard the Navy destroyer USS Biscoe . RFK Jr. writes that on July 18 - before the bodies of JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and Lauren Bessette were recovered - Ann Bessette began asking that her two daughters be buried near her home in Greenwich, Connecticut. 'Ann wants them close by and is terrified that the K family might try to spirit them to Brookline,' RFK Jr. writes. Several Kennedys are buried at Holyhood Cemetary in Brookline, Massachusetts - including patriarch and matriarch Joseph and Rose Kennedy - the parents of President Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy. The revelations come from the diary of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A meeting was set up between Ann Freeman and the Kennedys. JFK Jr.'s sister Caroline Kennedy was supposed to go to represent the Kennedy family. She sent her husband Ed Schlossberg instead. RFK Jr. writes: 'All the Bessette family knows that Ed hated Carolyn and did . everything in his power to make her life miserable. 'He bullied, . bullied, bullied the shattered grieving mother.' Schossberg's treatment of the Bessette family in the aftermath of the crash seemed to create a rift in the Kennedy family. At one point after the funerals, Carole Radziwill, the wife of Anthony Radziwill, JFK Jr.’s cousin and close friend, called RFK Jr. to complain about Schlossberg. 'She says she wants to start an ""I hate Ed Club."" There would be many, many members. John & Carolyn would have certainly applied,' RFK Jr. writes. Ultimately, the arguments turned out to be much ado about nothing. The families decided to have the victims' remains cremated and buried at sea near where they died. RFK Jr. recounts the beautiful scene from aboard the Navy destroyer USS Briscoe - which carried the grieving family out the sea. 'The water had more jellyfish in it than anyone had ever seen. When they let go of the ashes, the plume erupted and settled in the water and passed by in the green current like a ghost. We tossed flowers onto the ghosts,' he writes. 'Some of the girls tossed letters from a packet they’d assembled from John’s and Carolyn’s friends. It was a civil violation but the Coast Guard let it go.' JFK Jr. and wife Carolyn were compared to President Kennedy and First Lady Jackie Kennedy because of their seemingly fairy tale romance .","Death of President John F.

Tolokonnikova's husband Pyotr Verzilov also said his wife had not been heard from since she left the camp, some 250 miles from Moscow, on October 22.

View of Manhattan from the top of the Williamsburg Bridge, 2011: The New York that Steelie documents is one where people climb bridges, party in railroad tunnels, and sail homemade rafts on the Hudson River . Steelie fell in love with the city and all its wild possibilities after moving from Rocky River, Ohio. Although the city he documents is a far cry from the picture postcard version on sale to tourists in Times Square. His New York is an underground haven for people at society’s edges, who come alive at night to party in abandoned spaces, to make music and art and noise and mess. ‘I hope what happens is when you take in all these images and the subject matter and the aesthetic and you pile them together, you get a sense of this world that's kind of swirling right underneath a lot of people’s feet in New York,’ Seelie told Slate.com. He moved to the city to . attend the Pratt Institute in 1997 and became immersed in Brooklyn’s . burgeoning art and music scene.

Although many of the DIY venues he once frequented have now closed due to rising rents, Seelie believes it remains possible to enjoy an alternative lifestyle in New York - even if you need a regular pay-cheek to help fund it. ‘Some people may think that to do some of the stuff you see in the photos you have to have no job, never work. In fact, the opposite is true. 'A lot of the people in the photos have day jobs, and this is what they do at night. It's really about what you're passionate about, what you do, what you like to make happen on your own,’ he said. A lot of Seelie's photographs involve a high degree of risk as safety is often questionable and the police are never too far . away, but for Steelie it is simply a matter of weighing . risk and reward.

It's just one aspect of life where you have to evaluate it for yourself. Maybe something's too dangerous, something's too risky, or something's just too stupid - but maybe it's totally worth it,’ he said. Many people will view Seelie’s adventures as things they simply wouldn’t dream of doing – or perhaps are too scared to try – but it is somehow reassuring to know that somewhere out there in the night there are people crowd surfing in high heels or playing in a mutant brass band. Seelie's photographs prove that the city that never sleeps is still there, it's just that if you want to find it you might need to look a bit harder and travel a bit further to the outer boroughs than some of those people so quick to say that New York isn’t as good as it once was.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has described recent initiatives by tech companies such as Facebook and Google to bring internet access to the entire world and position online connectivity as a humanitarian concern as ‘a joke’. The world’s richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List, Gates has devoted himself to humanitarian causes since stepping down from a full-time role at Microsoft in 2006. While Gates, 58, said technology is ‘amazing’, he doesn’t believe it is on the ‘first five rungs’ of basic human needs. Microsoft founder Bill Gates', left, has described recent initiatives by tech companies including Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook to position online connectivity as a humanitarian concern as 'a joke' ‘I certainly love the IT thing,’ Gates told The Financial Times. ‘But when we want to improve lives, you've got to deal with more basic things like child survival, child nutrition.’ ‘PCs are not, in the hierarchy of human needs, in the first five rungs,’ he added. Gates' comments come just a few months after Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook wants to get more of the world's more than seven billion people online through a partnership with some of the world's largest mobile technology companies. Known as Internet.org, the initiative was launched in August and also includes South Korean electronics giant Samsung, Finnish handset maker Nokia and wireless chip maker Qualcomm. Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, right, and Melinda Gates meeting with members of the Mushar community at Jamsot Village near Patna, India, in 2011 . Facebook said the group's goal is to ‘make internet access available to the two-thirds of the world who are not yet connected’ - about five billion people. Google isn’t part of the Internet.org, but launched a similar initiative earlier in the year with the goal of getting everyone on Earth online. Project Loon uses high-altitude balloons placed in the stratosphere at an altitude of about 20km to create an aerial wireless network with up to 3G-like speeds. While Gates said that improvements in technology certainly bring important benefits, they won't meet the more pressing needs of the world's most desperate people. When asked by the FT if internet connectivity is more important than finding a vaccination for malaria, the Microsoft co-founder sad: ‘As a priority? It's a joke.’ Microsoft co-founder Gates, 58, says technology is 'amazing', he doesn't believe it is on the 'first five rungs' of basic human needs . ‘If you think connectivity is the key thing, that’s great. I don’t,’ he added. Although Gates remains involved with Microsoft in a part-time capacity and continues as chairmen, his focus since 2006 has been the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Gates has so far given US$28 billion of his fortune to the foundation and much of that money has been spent on improving health and fighting poverty in developing countries by tackling malaria or paying for vaccination drives against infectious diseases.","Gates described initiatives by Facebook and Google to position online connectivity as a humanitarian concern as 'a joke'

Taking lessons learned from the Boston Marathon bombings, authorities and marathon organizers have doubled down on the use of surveillance cameras, bomb sniffing dogs, scuba divers, and even counterterrorism agents. The heightened security, which includes almost 2,000 cameras, was announced during a Friday afternoon press conference held jointly by the New York Police Department and the New York Road Runners club. ‘This will be the best-protected race that they can enter,’ said police commissioner Ray Kelly. We're on it: New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly (left), and Mary Wittenberg (right), of the New York Road Runners, discuss security plans for the Sunday's New York City Marathon . The sweeping changes are part of an overhaul that doubled the marathon’s security budget to more than $1million, officials said. Of all the changes along the 26.2-mile route, the most important is the access officials will have to almost every inch of the race and spectators should the unthinkable happen. In addition to hundreds of strategically positioned temporary cameras, as well as the use of permanent cameras, officials have fingered over 1,400 private-sector cameras they can access. ‘We are well positioned to stop it and certainly apprehend someone who's engaged in it,’ Mr Kelly added while surrounded by giant monitors displaying different part of the course. Racers and spectators have been banned from wearing costumes that include masks, a tradition some have long partaken in, officials added. Cameras galore: Almost 2,000 cameras will give officials access to almost every foot of the 26.2 mile race, as displayed here above Friday's press conference . Extra eyes needed: Security footage of the Boston Marathon bombing was key to identifying the accused attackers . Found'em!: Boston officials were quickly able to make public this photo of brothers Dzhokhar (left) and (right)Tamarlan Tsarnaev to enlist the public's help to hunt them down . Boston officials were able to quickly identify and hunt down marathon bombing suspects Tamarlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the days after the attack, mainly a result of footage and spectator pictures made public. New York officials met with their Boston counterparts in the months leading up the New York Marathon to help plan security measures for Sunday’s event, the first in two years after last year's race was cancelled in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. ‘The safety and security of our runners and spectators has always been of highest priority and following the tragedy in Boston we’ve taken a deeper look at what can be done to enhance those plans,’ a race spokesperson said in a statement. No specific threats have been identified, but authorities are still pulling out all the stops to ensure safety for both spectators and the 45,000-plus athletes competing in Sunday’s race. The most surprising moment of the press conference came when a bomb sniffing black Labrador named Ray was brought in to demonstrate the effective of the 43 dogs deployed along the route. Safe and sound: Runners are screened by police officers as they arrive Sunday for the 2013 New York City Marathon . Eyes everywhere Police officers from the counterterrorism unit stand watch over runners who arrive at the Staten Island starting line . It took Ray only seconds to locate a person holding a small amount of black powder in the middle of the packed briefing. Security measures are not just limited to the ground, significant resources are being poured into the city’s waterways as well. Extra steps have included an unspecified number of scuba divers sweeping bridge supports for explosives, as well as police boat patrols and counterterror agents escorting runners taking the ferry to the Staten Island start line, said officials. Divers began sweeping various sites on Thursday, the commissioner noted. Extra helicopters have also been added to an always-robust airborne security presence as well, Mr Kelly noted. ‘We are well equipped and well deployed,’ said the commissioner. Other security measures will include more rigorous bag searches, extra security guards, plain clothes officers and number of other undisclosed actions, officials added. Even in the sky: Apolice helicopter patrols near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge at the start of the race . Just one: Runners have been limited to only one bag, the clear plastic one provided by the NYRR club . Star of the show: Ray, a four-year-old Labrador Retriever, took only seconds to find a person holding a lure during a bomb sniffing demonstration in the crowded press briefing . The New York Fire Department is even on alert and has trained for ‘terrorist-type activity,’ an FDNY spokesperson added. ‘People will feel a nice added measure in a way that feels supportive and not stifling,’ race director Mary Wittenberg told USA Today. Despite the added hassle of passing through metal detectors, being limited to only one bag and various other restrictions, most runners were in favor of the added security. 'It will obviously cause some problems for us, but that doesn't matter,’ marathon veteran Runar Gundersen told CNN. ‘Security must come first, so I gladly accept delays... I think most runners do.’ Mr Gunderson will be running in his 35th New York City Marathon, CNN noted. Shalane Flanagan, running in New York for the first time, agreed. ‘I don't think it affects things in a negative way, I think it just makes people on their toes and appreciate when things run smoothly,’ she told USA Today. Friend of Ray: A total of 43 bomb sniffing dogs have been deployed along the race . Private eyes: In addition to an increased official police presence, private security guard numbers have also been upped along the race course, including the Central Park finish line pictured here . Best-laid plans: Officials and runners alike feel this is the safest race they can enter . Another runner, Kenyan Parliament member Wesley Korir, understands first-hand the importance of added security measures. The veteran runner finished fifth in this year’s Boston Marathon, and his home country is still suffering from the fallout of September’s Westgate Mall attack, which left more than 70 people dead. ‘It is not fun to come here and be checked when you're coming in,’ Mr Korir told USA Today, ‘but it is something that's a wakeup call that we live in a world that is going somewhere that we don't like.’ Likely speaking the minds of many, Mr Korir added that runners are not easily scared off. ‘They will never defeat us. They will never intimidate us. They are targeting the wrong group of people.’ More than 45,000 runners stand as proof – but should the worst happen, New York is ready.","The 2013 New York City Marathon's security budget has been doubled to more than $1million .

A California mother who had a stroke while surgeons were operating on her brain is no longer able to recognize faces or her own reflection. Tara Fall, who has suffered from prosopagnosia, or face blindness, for ten years, can recall conversations and details about the way a person dresses, but that is all. The 37-year-old has to rely on a process of elimination to help her recognize people, including her two daughters. Memory blindness: Tara Fall is unable to recognize faces, even those of her husband and children . 'If my kids were to change clothes when . they’re at school … if they were to try to trick me, they’d probably get . away with it,' she told CBS Los Angeles. 'I’ve learned to cope quite well. I can hide it from most people. But on the other side, it’s very intimidating when you don’t know your kids,' she added. Mrs Fall developed face blindness after having surgery to try to control seizures. She suffered a stroke during the operation, which damaged the right side of the brain that deals with recognition. 'You could . close your eyes and picture somebody close to you. Picture your mother . or father and you could get a very vivid image in your head of what they . look like. Tara can no longer do that,' Dr Justin Feinstein said. The clinical neuropsychologist at Caltech, added: 'For 10 years now, her idea of what she . looks like is still that same 27-year-old woman. It hasn’t advanced.' Tell-tale signs: Tara with her daughters. She relies on characteristics and hair styles to remember them . Before she had the surgery Mrs Fall, who had suffered from epilepsy her whole life, was so worried that she may lose her entire memory that she jotted down details about her life, her children's names and her likes and dislikes. But while she can remember everything from before her stroke, and has a great memory for conversations and other details, after the operation she could no longer remember faces. 'It’s an intimidating world, but it’s one that I’ve learned to cope with,' she told The Gazette in Iowa. The situation is made more difficult because her husband is in the Navy and serves overseas for long periods. Research: Dr Justin Feinstein, a clinical neuropsychologist , and Tara Fall who lost her ability to recognize faces . Her inability to recognize someone can happen in the blink of an eye. If she was talking to a person who then looked away and removed their glasses, she would be at a loss to who was now in front of her. 'I recognize more the clues that fit the person,' Mrs Fall said, adding that she concentrates on a particular characteristic or other signs that others may miss. And while she has managed to learn to walk again, and takes part in research groups in the hope that one day a cure will be found, for now Mrs Fall has to rely on a process of elimination to figure out who is standing in front of her.","Tara Fall developed prosopagnosia - face blindness - after surgery to stop seizures .

A librarian in New Mexico claims that she witnessed her boss and a city maintenance worker having sex in the library's children's section earlier this year and reported it to her superiors - and then SHE got fired. The alleged incident happened one morning in August - Estancia assistant librarian Jamie Kurz got to work a little early and noticed two cars in the library's parking lot: her boss' and a city maintenance truck. She didn't find anything strange about the maintenance truck being in the library's parking lot - until she walked in the building. Canned: Jamie Kurz claimed she was fired for reporting that she caught her boss having sex at work . Nothing suspicious: Kurz said she didn't think anything of it when she saw a maintenance truck in the library's parking lot . '[She] turned around and saw two other employees engaged in sexual intercourse on the floor in the children's section,' Kurz's attorney, Joseph Campbell, told KRQE. Kurz identified the two as her boss, the head librarian, and a maintenance worker - both of whom, she says, are married to other people. Kurz says the maintenance worker told her to not say anything about the incident to anyone. But she did - Kurz took her complaint to the city library director, and ultimately to Estancia's Mayor Sylvia Chavez. 'The mayor subsequently talked to Jamie about it, told her that it wouldn't have any effect on her job,' Campbell says. Scene of the crime: Kurz says her boss had sex in the children's section of the library . However, after the head librarian returned to work, she complained that Kurz was creating a hostile work environment and she was fired, presumably at the directive of the mayor. The library director also was fired. On October 10, Chavez sent Kurz a termination letter explaining that her firing was the result of her failure to turn over a library key while she was on leave. 'our refusal to turn over Town property upon request and as required to . ensure uninterrupted library services shows a lack of cooperation and . willingness to work with supervisors,' wrote Chavez in the letter. 'This . behavior constitutes insubordination and jeopardizes the Town's ability . to serve its citizens.' Campbell, however, claims Kurz was fired in an attempt to sweep the incident with the head librarian and the maintenance worker under the rug - according to Campbell, the unidentified couple are locals who are 'close' with the mayor. Coverup: Kurz attorney thinks she was fired because Mayor Chavez (pictured) is friends with the pair she caught having sex in the library . In a recorded conversation between Kurz and the head librarian - made in attempt to corroborate Kurz's claim - the librarian doesn't actually admit to having sex in the children's section, but does tell Kurz that 'if she can't handle the situation, [she] should find another job,' according to KRQE, which listended to the recording. Campbell says that the mayor's actions could result in him firing a whistleblower lawsuit on Kurz behalf.","Jamie Kurz says she was fired because the town's mayor is trying to cover up the library sex scandal because she is a friend of the couple Kurz caught having sex .

Fast food fans, beware: Next time you want a takeaway from your favourite restaurant chain you may get more than you bargained for. Some of the nation's most popular fast food shops have been found with mice living in the kitchens, and droppings on shelves and cooking equipment. Details obtained from official reports by local authority hygiene officers have revealed some of the most shocking - and in some cases dangerous - fast food restaurants across the UK. This chart shows how the major fast food chains scored, based on the Food Standards Agency hygiene rating. The top half shows the average score (out of five) taken from various restaurant ratings across the country. The bottom half shows the lowest score an individual restaurant in a chain received . The food safety officer from a local authority inspects a business to see how hygienically the food is handled, the condition of the building and how it keeps food safe. It is then rated from zero to five. Some of the worst offenders included: . Domino's Pizza London - 0/5: Mouse droppings found on shelves, equipment and surfaces; employee found sleeping on packaging . KFC Islington - 0/5: The council refused the FOI request . Wimpy Welling Kent - 0/5: Same surfaces and utensils used for raw and cooked food; lettuce stored in a bucket . Chicken Cottage Aylesbury - 0/5: Lack of dating on food suggested no way of telling when food went out of date . Papa Johns Maidenhead - 1/5: Unclean kitchen and excessive amounts of rubbish at rear of premises . Burger King Brent Cross - 2/5: Mouse found on the premises and structural repairs needed to control pest issues . McDonalds Leicester - 2/5: Dirty freezers, mould found in sinks and employees not washing their their hands . Chicken Cottage was found to be the UK's 'most disgusting' food chain after receiving the lowest average . score during official hygiene inspections - it was also found to be the . most dangerous with 71 gang-related crimes reported at a Ladbroke Grove . branch in London alone. The information was collected by a Sussex-based health and safety firm Tutorcare using Freedom of Information requests. The findings also discovered mouse droppings on shelves and equipment in a London branch of Domino's Pizza, and the same utensils being used in a Wimpy in Kent to handle raw and cooked food. Despite pest control problems in the Brent Cross branch of Burger King, the chain was branded the 'least disgusting' for receiving the highest average score across all of its branches in hygiene tests. Tutorcare compiled information from various requests for hygiene inspection scores to create the national average. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) issues guidelines to local authorities with a hygiene rating score out of five. The Chicken Cottage chain achieved a three overall, while Wimpy was second from bottom with an average score of four. Papa Johns scored slightly higher than Chicken Cottage. Across the board KFC, McDonalds, Burger King and Domino's Pizza all received an average score of between four and five with Burger King scoring the highest at 4.85. The lowest hygiene score obtained by a single Chicken Cottage, KFC, Wimpy and Domino's branch was zero out of five. Details obtained from the local authorities found that Chicken Cottage (stock image of sink used) received the lowest average score during official hygiene inspections across the UK. The information was collected by a Sussex-based health and safety firm Tutorcare using Freedom of Information requests . Papa Johns had a lowest score of one, while McDonalds and Burger King branches' lowest rating was two. Commenting on the findings, managing director of Tutorcare, Gareth Jones told MailOnline: 'Every restaurant must ensure that the food they serve and sell is safe to eat, this should be the cornerstone of any food related business. Food safety must always come ahead of profit.' Tutorcare also pulled out specific examples of poor hygiene in the lowest scoring branches. The Food Hygiene Inspection Report indicated that Chicken Cottage in Aylesbury had numerous failings which gave it the Food Hygiene Rating of zero. The first issue identified by the inspecting Environmental Health Officer was the lack of dating on food in the chiller. This meant employees had no way to tell how long meats had been stored in the fridge and consequently had no way to know if the meat they were storing was past its use by date. Secondly the inspecting officer noted that there was no soap at the hand wash area, raising serious concerns that employees may have been handling food that would be sold to customers, without having washed their hands. During hygiene inspections by the Food Standards Agency, mouse droppings were found in a London branch of Domino's Pizza, out of date food was said to be discovered at Chicken Cottage in Aylesbury and Papa Johns in Maidenhead was unclean . The lowest performing branch of Domino's was located in London - although the precise location was not revealed. It had some 'particularly notable failings' when the food safety officer for the area visited at the end of April 2013. The officer located a significant amount of mouse droppings on the premises including on shelves, surfaces and under equipment. The officer also noted that the standard of cleanliness throughout the facility was poor. A staff member was additionally found sleeping on the premises on the food packaging. On 8 July, a visiting food safety inspector recommended some structural repairs and improvements at the Burger King in Brent Cross Shopping Station to reduce the risk of pest issues. Despite pest problems in a Brent Cross branch of Burger King, the chain was branded the 'least disgusting' for getting the highest average score across all of its branches in hygiene tests. Tutorcare also found specific examples of poor hygiene in the lowest scoring branches, pictured . However, when a mouse was caught on the premises during the evening of 17 July the inspector noted that the recommended alteration remained outstanding. The lowest scoring UK branch of Papa Johns was found in Maidenhead. The inspecting food safety officer raised particular concerns that there seemed to be a number of men who did not appear connected with the business present in the preparation area without reason to be there or the necessary clean/protective clothing to prevent food contamination. A number of issues attributed to McDonalds in Leicester receiving a food hygiene rating of two out of five. The inspecting food safety officer specifically mentioned the appearance of mould in the sealant at the back of both the hand washing trough and the equipment sink, and holes in the wall of the boiler room which could lead to pest problems.","The details were obtained by health and safety firm Tutorcare, from various local authorities using the Freedom of Information Act .

A Royal Marine sergeant was caught on camera ‘executing’ a severely injured Taliban prisoner before telling his comrades: ‘I’ve just broken the Geneva Convention,’ a court martial heard yesterday. As the insurgent lay stricken with horrendous wounds from a helicopter strike, the 37-year-old commando pointed his 9mm pistol at the man’s chest and pulled the trigger. Footage of the alleged cold-blooded killing in an Afghan cornfield was captured in graphic video inadvertently filmed by one of the Marines on a helmet-mounted camera. The seven members of the military jury watch a video of Marine A allegedly shooting the insurgent . The sergeant then taunted the dying man, who twitched and convulsed as he gasped his final breaths, by telling him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***,’ it is claimed. Yesterday dramatic images and audio recordings of the ‘field execution’ were played to a court martial where three commandos – known only as Marines A, B and C – stand accused of murder. The men, who have been granted anonymity to protect them from any reprisals, deny the charges. It is the first case of its kind for British troops involved in the Afghan campaign. Prosecutors told the seven-strong military jury that Marine A killed the wounded insurgent after his unit seized him on September 15, 2011. Marines B and C ‘encouraged and assisted’ him, the hearing was told . David Perry QC said the Taliban . fighter was ‘harmless and posed no danger’. He added: ‘This was not a . killing in the heat or exercise of armed conflict. The prosecution case . is that it amounted to a field execution – the execution of a man who . was entitled to be treated with dignity and respect.’ The . court martial, which took place under tight security at Bulford . military court centre in Wiltshire, was told the shooting followed an . attack on a British checkpoint in Helmand province. A surveillance blimp showed two insurgents launching an assault against the remote outpost with assault rifles. An Apache helicopter gunship was sent from Camp Bastion, Britain’s main base in Afghanistan, and fired 139 rounds from its 30mm cannon. Members of the Bulford Court Martial Board turn in their seats to scrutinise the video clip . The . aircrew believed the man targeted ‘simply could not have survived’ the . fearsome barrage, so the three Marines were sent on a ‘battle damage . assessment’ patrol. The . trio – who all served with 42 Commando – discovered the severely . wounded man lying in a field, armed with an old AK-47 assault rifle, two . magazines of ammunition and a hand grenade. Six minutes of film footage recorded . on Marine B’s helmet was played to the trial, showing the unit . approaching the stricken man and calling him a ‘f****** p****’, ‘c***’ and ‘b******’. As they . reach the Afghan, he is lying on the ground, covered in blood, wearing . white robes and no shoes. Marine A used his radio to report that the . enemy was still alive. The non-commissioned officer, with 13 years’ service in the military, then ordered his men to move the prisoner out . of sight of cameras on the surveillance blimp. The . injured man was dragged into a wooded area nearby. Marine A asked: . ‘Anybody want to give first aid to this idiot?’ Another voice quickly . replied: ‘Nope’. Marine C offered to shoot him in the head, sparking laughter. But Marine A rejects the idea as ‘that would be f****** obvious’. As the men discuss killing their prisoner, Marine B is seen reaching up to the helmet camera and telling his comrades: ‘Let’s switch this f****r off.’ But a short time later, he switched the camera back on. In extraordinary footage, one Marine is heard saying, ‘F***’s sake, I can’t believe we are doing this.’ Seconds later, Marine A is filmed kneeling next to the man, putting his pistol to his chest and firing. The victim is seen convulsing and struggling after the shot. Marine A then says: ‘There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’ He then turns to his comrades and says: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I’ve just broken the Geneva Convention.’ Marine B replies: ‘Roger. If it ever comes to light, it was just a warning shot.’ Members of the defence legal team at Bulford Court Martial Board sit next to a blue screen erected in the courtroom to hide the identities of three Royal Marine Commandos accused of the murder . The patrol can be heard reporting back that the fighter had died of wounds inflicted by the gunship. Part of the footage came to light  in September 2012 when police searched a laptop following the arrest of another Marine on an unrelated matter. The images of the alleged murder were discovered a few weeks later following expert analysis. Mr Perry said: ‘It was obvious that they were intent upon killing their detainee, who at the time of the killing was harmless and who posed no danger to the defendants. ‘At its most basic the prosecution case is this: Marine A – using a pistol – deliberately shot and killed an injured man. Although Marine A fired the gun at close range into the injured man’s chest and caused his death, the prosecution case is that Marines B and C were also party to his killing. The video footage clearly speaks for itself and shows the execution of a severely injured man.’ Prosecutor David Perry QC told the board at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire, that Marine B filmed the incident on a camera mounted on his helmet . The court heard the dead man had never been identified and no body had been found. During his police interview, Marine A told detectives he fired a bullet into the insurgent through ‘stress and anger’ at seeing comrades killed on the battlefield. But he insisted the man was already dead. Marine C wrote an account of the incident in his diary, the court heard. In it, he said he saw Marine A carrying out the killing. He wrote that his only regret was he felt ‘mugged off’ he had not been able to ‘pop off the Taliban s***bag’ himself’. Confronted with the video in October 2012, the men changed their stories. Marine A admitted firing his pistol but said he ‘genuinely believed’ the man was dead. Marine B said he was giving the injured man first aid when Marine A shot him. He said: ‘I was stunned and there was a long pause before I said anything. If I was saying “rog” or “roger” to Marine A after, I was just acknowledging I heard what he said – I was not agreeing with it.’ The case continues.

The family of an 18-year-old Miami graffiti artist who died after being chased and Tasered by a pair of Miami Beach police officers on Tuesday are outraged after witnesses described seeing the cops high-fiving each other in celebration as he lay dying. The distraught father of Israel Hernandez-Llach has called for an investigation into what he called an 'act of barbarism and assassination' and Officer Jorge Mercado, a 13-year veteran of the force, has been placed on paid administrative leave - pending an investigation. The teenager, an award-winning artist, was stunned in the chest after officers reportedly caught him spray-painting the front of a closed McDonald's and gave chase for ten minutes before catching him. Shocking: At just 17, Israel Hernandez-Llach was already an award-winning artist, on the threshold of acclaim in Miami Beach art circles. He was a sculptor, painter, writer and photographer whose craft was inspired by Colombia . Thiago Souza, who was with Hernandez-Llach and acting as his lookout, said the chase began as soon as the officers approached them and told them to stop. Losing sight of his friend during the chase, Souza caught up to him to find Hernandez-Llach face-down on the sidewalk. 'I didn’t even know they fired a Taser. I thought they just had him down and he was arrested and was just tired,’ Souza said to the Miami Herald. 'I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,’ said Souza, 19. 'I asked the cops ‘what happened to my friend?’ Tragic: Israel Hernandez-Llach is pictured in this undated handout photo courtesy of Heather Bozzone.

'He said ‘you should have seen how funny it was when his butt clenched when he got Tased’ he said, and they were all clapping and doing high-fives all over his body. It was almost like they were proud of what they did.’ It was then that they all noticed medics working furiously to revive Hernandez-Llach, after he lost consciousness. 'The cop told me he was dead. It was just a powerful image seeing my friend there, with the medics pumping him.’ Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez said his department was investigating the incident and expressed his condolences to the family of Hernandez-Llach, a Colombian immigrant who graduated from high school this summer. According to the police report, Hernandez-Llach fled after he was confronted by police about 5 a.m. The pursuit ended with Hernandez-Llach cornered and, with nowhere to go, he began running toward the officers, Martinez said Wednesday. To avoid physically restraining Hernandez-Llach, Officer Jorge Mercado used his Taser. Martinez said after being . stunned, the teenager began showing signs of distress and . paramedics were called .

The boy's family held a press conference with lawyers . at their Miami Beach apartment on Thursday to say they planned to file a . complaint with the FBI or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement . over what they described as excessive use of force by the officers . involved. 'We do not want Miami Beach police investigating the Miami Beach Police Department. We're calling for an independent investigation by an outside agency,' said Jose Javier Rodriguez, an attorney for the family and a Florida state legislator. 'There is no justification of this kind of action for a second-degree misdemeanor,' said Jason W. Kreiss, another lawyer representing the family. Hernandez-Llach would likely not have been prosecuted over the spray-painting and would have faced a punishment of community service, he added. Police in Miami have not made any of the reports of the incident public, but Officer Thomas Lincoln, who wrote the official incident report said that he did not see Hernandez-Llach shot by the Taser. He said that when he arrived on the scene the teen was 'sitting on the ground and against a wall.'. Martinez said Hernandez-Llach fled after being seen 'vandalizing private property' shortly before dawn on Tuesday.

'At this time, the cause of death has not been determined by the medical examiner's office. Autopsy and toxicology results are still pending as well,' Martinez added. The artist's father, Israel Hernandez-Bandera, called his son's death 'an act of barbarism' and an 'assassination of a young artist and photographer.' Friends of Hernandez-Llach who witnessed the police chase accused officers of making jokes after using the Taser. 'I saw four or five cops converge on him and hit him up against the wall,' said Felix Fernandez, 18. He said he was standing nearby acting as a lookout for Hernandez-Llach and tried to warn him when he heard police sirens approaching.

Hernandez-Llach, who identified himself by the so-called tag name ""Reefa,"" was known for his graffiti work as well as for his sculptures and paintings. 'He did it a lot,' said Hernandez-Llach's friend, Rafael Lynch, referring to his graffiti. 'He wasn't a bad person at all. The cops didn't like him or what he looked like.'

A Colorado artist has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping an eight-year-old girl from her bedroom in Aurora. John Stanley Snorsky, 26, was arrested on Tuesday morning following a separate incident of felony theft. Following more than 200 tips, the Aurora Police Department arrived at probable cause to charge him with the kidnapping Friday. Write caption here . He has been charged with first and second degree burglary and second degree kidnapping and is being held on $500,000 bond, police said at a press conference today. The eight-year-old girl was brazenly taken from her bedroom on Monday night by the kidnapper, who cut the screen of an unlocked window. According to Fox31, Snorsky allegedly pulled the screaming girl from the room and carried her to an alley behind the house. Police say the kidnapper was trying to get the girl into his car when she managed to escape. The girl's father, who was alerted by her screams, told police he saw the man drive away in what looked like a silver BMW. While they were sleeping: The home on the 1600 block of Hanover St from which Johnathan Snorsky abducted an eight-year-old girl . Write caption here . He ran out of the home and found his daughter running back home from the alley behind the house, police said. 'This is a reminder... how important it is to make a lot of noise in these types of situations,' police said Saturday. 'She's very bright... very, very brave.' The girl was examined at a local hospital and suffered only minor injuries. She was able to give police a very accurate description of her abductor, resulting in a composite sketch that bears close resemblance to Snorsky. The girl told police the man who abducted her had blond hair and smelled strongly of cigarettes. It's unknown whether the kidnapping was random or if Snorsky had been watching the family and knew which was the little girl's bedroom. Snorsky, is a 'self-taught' artist who has a Facebook page under the name Johnathan Artist featuring pictures of himself and his work. Friends and acquaintances have commented on the page since news of his arrest, expressing surprise and in some cases, a lack thereof. One wrote, 'I've known him since we were kids and I totally think he did it.' 'Omg I can’t even imagine what he was thinking!!! I’m at a loss for words right now,' wrote another. At work: The self-proclaimed artist posted this picture of himself drawing on his Facebook page . ABC 7 reports that a friend of Snorsky contacted the publication to defend him. 'I know Johnathan, and he isn't bothered by many things. He is the most humble, loving, and caring person I have ever met in my life. He knows he did some bad things as a kid, which in turn led him to serve time in corrections - however there is only one thing... ONE THING that he will not stand for... and that is sex crimes, child abduction, or anything of the sort. I feel as if they were just looking for someone that fit the profile.'According to American Live Wire, Snorksy emigrated to the U.S. from Russia as a child and has a long rap sheet including arrests for burglary and escaping from prison.Snorsky works at a sub shop at 6th Ave and Sable Boulevard in Aurora and drives a silver-grey Mercedes, according to ABC 7.","John Snorksy, 26, allegedly cut the screen of an unlocked window and took an eight-year-old from her bedroom Monday .

Caught in the act: Tajreed Rich was arrested after the father of a 17-year-old student found him naked in her bedroom . A high school hall monitor has been arrested after being caught naked with a student by the 17-year-old girl's father. The 41-year-old, who worked at Robbinsdale Cooper High School in Minneapolis, was charged with sexual assault on Friday, after the girl's father returned home early and discovered the man in his daughter's bedroom. After hearing strange noises, the father walked into his daughter's bedroom and saw a naked Tajreed Rich standing over his daughter, who was naked on her bed. The father, who has not been named, recognized Rich from the school and the family called police later that day. Rich, who had counseled students at the high school about relationships and had previously helped coach a cheer leading squad at a different school, was fired by Robbinsdale Cooper on Monday. The teenager, who has not been named, alleges that she had intercourse with Rich twice. He confirmed this to police, telling them they had sex once at his home and once at her house. Rich added that he did not use a condom on either occasion, according to Fox9. The hall monitor described the girl as a 'vulnerable student', and said he knew he should not have had a sexual relationship with a student. The school had ended for the summer vacation on Wednesday, but a voice mail message was sent to parents on Friday confirming that Rich, who had worked at the school for more than two years, had been arrested. A Robbinsdale Cooper High School statement said: 'This is a horrible incident, and the . district finds acts such as this reprehensible. The safety and . well-being of our students is our top priority, and our hearts go out to . the family during this time.' At a conference about the incident, County Attorney Mike Freeman said: '[It's] a tragedy for any father [who] comes home and finds his daughter in bed with another man'. 'He’s 41, she’s 17 ... He’s a hall monitor. I mean, the charge here is a position of authority.

A corrupt Sainsbury’s executive who took bribes of cash and lavish hospitality worth £5million in return for a multi-million-pound contract was jailed for four years yesterday. John Maylam, 45, who was in charge of buying potato crops for the supermarket, allowed Greenvale, a major supplier, to overcharge Sainsbury’s by £8.7million for its crop in a £40million deal. Using complex financial arrangements, he was able to artificially inflate the price without his bosses noticing. In return, Greenvale laundered the money through bogus companies and vastly excessive expenses funds that Maylam used to live like a millionaire. During a two-year period, Greenvale siphoned off £4.9million from Sainsbury’s and placed it in an account known as ‘The Fund’. Maylam used it to treat himself to a £93,000 Aston Martin V8 Vantage, took his wife to some of the best hotels in the world, enjoyed extravagant yachting trips and regularly consumed fine wines and Dom Perignon champagne. He also ran up a £200,000 bill while staying at Claridge’s hotel in Mayfair for 137 nights, and was taken on a £350,000 holiday to watch the Monaco Grand Prix. Police were called in and the trio arrested after irregular payments were discovered during an audit by accountants at Produce Investments, Greenvale’s parent company. Yesterday, Greenvale director Andrew Behagg, 60, and accounts manager David Baxter, 50, were jailed for three years and two-and-a-half years respectively for their parts in the scam. Jailing the three men, Judge Nicholas Ainley said: ‘This is a case of bribery and corruption. But not just that, this is a case of corruption involving theft on a huge scale.’ He said Sainsbury’s was, in effect, ‘being bribed with its own money’. Lavish: The scam funded sports cars, yachts and extravagant holidays . 'Utter abuse': Former Greenvale directors David Baxter (left) and Andrew Behagg (right) were also jailed . Extravagant: One of the bars at Claridge's, the luxury London hotel where Maylam ran up a £200,000 bill paid as part of the bribes . He added: ‘As far as Maylam and Baxter . were concerned, it was a till to be rifled, and Behagg signed off . ludicrous expenses claims knowing his company would not be paying the . money but Sainsbury’s would.’ Croydon Crown Court in south London . heard how Maylam and Baxter – who were highly respected by their . employers – became drinking partners and concocted the scam. As a senior buyer for Sainsbury’s, . Maylam had almost total control of its potato budget. Sainsbury’s was . overcharged £8.7million between 2005 and 2007 and the expenses account . at Greenvale accumulated £4.9million from 2006 to 2008. Maylam received payments via an account in Luxembourg to the tune of £1.5million and ran up expenses of £20,000 a month. Flash: Maylam drove a £93,000 Aston Martin similar to the one pictured . In May 2007, Maylam jetted off to the . south of France and Monte Carlo with his wife, Baxter and three others . for an all-expenses-paid holiday for his 40th birthday. The total bill for their rooms, meals . and corporate hospitality tickets for the Monaco Grand Prix came to over . £350,000. Maylam’s bill for a presidential suite during the race was . £48,000 alone. Greenvale simply signed off the trip as ‘team building’. Nicholas Walker, defending Maylam, said his client’s spending was ‘out of touch and excessive almost to the point of vulgarity’. Baxter also used his company’s expenses account liberally, and notched up 77 nights at Claridge’s. Blowout: The millionaire's playground of Monaco, where Maylam spent a £350,000 holiday watching the Grand Prix and celebrating his 40th birthday . Eventually he was treated for liver . cirrhosis because he was drinking so much champagne and fine wine. He is . believed to have personally netted £100,000 from the scam. Outside court, Detective . Superintendent Tony Crampton, of the City of London Police, said: . ‘Maylam and Baxter both had good jobs with decent salaries, but they . wanted a place on millionaires’ row. They were greedy for a luxury . lifestyle – frittering the money away on frivolous spending which was . only made possible by Behagg’s complicity. ‘The men thought their fraud was so complex they would not be detected.’ Maylam, of Maidstone, Kent, and . Baxter, of Hinstock, near Market Drayton in Shropshire, admitted . corruption and acquiring criminal property at an earlier hearing. Behagg, of Chatteris in . Cambridgeshire, was found guilty by a jury  in May of authorising . payments in return for lucrative contracts.","Two executives also given prison terms over £4.9m bribes to John Maylam .

A 16-year-old boy who threw acid at a woman on her doorstep was sentenced to eight years and three months today. Tara Quigley, 28, suffered horrific burns to her face and body in the attack and has undergone two skin grafts. The teenager, who can now be named as Liam Robert Sibbons after Judge David Radford lifted a reporting restriction, sprayed a solution of chromic acid at her after she answered the door to him at her home in Romford, East London, in April. Tara Quigley suffered injuries to her face and upper body in an acid attack on her doorstep in Romford, East London in April. The substance is based on sulphuric acid and is strongly acidic, the court heard. Sibbons, who can not be pictured for legal reasons, admitted throwing corrosive fluid on a person with intent to do grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing. Judge Radford said the teenager would serve six years and three months of the sentence in custody and the remaining two years on licence. Sibbons, wearing a white shirt and dark tie, remained impassive and stared straight ahead as he was sentenced. Prosecutor Martin Whitehouse told Snaresbrook Crown Court: 'This was an horrific attack, involving a degree of brutality and callousness rarely encountered. 'Almost, one might say, beyond comprehension.' Miss Quigley, who did not know the . teenager, has been left permanently scarred. She suffered burns to 7 per . cent  of her body, including her right arm, forearm, shoulder, chest, . neck and face.

She will need regular treatment over the next four years and is due another operation shortly. Mr Whitehouse said Miss Quigley had been waiting for someone to deliver cannabis on the evening of April 30 when she saw someone approaching the house. Upon opening the door, she was asked by the person if she was called Michelle. When she said no, he walked off - but there was a loud knock on the door 10 minutes later. The prosecutor said: 'Miss Quigley opened the front door and saw the same man. He was holding onto a white bottle with both hands. 'He then pointed the bottle at Miss Quigley and squeezed. 'Miss Quigley felt liquid come into contact with her skin, followed almost immediately by a burning sensation. 'The man remained where he was, Miss Quigley shut the door and began to scream. 'She ran to the kitchen, turned the tap on and started putting water on her face.' An ambulance was called and rushed Miss Quigley to hospital to be treated. Raising the issue: Ms Quigley appeared on ITV's Daybreak programme, left, to talk about the case which reached its conclusion today.

She said her life had been turned upside down and that she did not feel safe returning to her home.Miss . Quigley now has limited mobility in her leg, for which she is . undergoing physiotherapy, and has been told the skin grafts have only . been 85% successful. 'I . have lost confidence in my physical appearance and feel that people will . stare at me when they see the scars' she said in her statement, . describing the aftermath of the attack as 'crushingly stressful'. Happy: Tara left the court smiling, but she did not want to speak to reporters after the sentencing . She . added: 'I will have to live with this attack and the scars it has left . me with for the rest of my life and nothing I can say or do will change . that. 'I truly hope that . the man responsible knows just what he has done and the grief and . anguish he has caused to me and my entire family.' Sibbons received an acid burn to the left side of his chest in the attack, the court heard. When police spoke to him shortly before his arrest in May, he told officers: 'Yes, I did throw acid in the girl's face.' He has four previous convictions and was on bail at the time of the attack. Howard Cohen, defending, said: 'It is something he will regret for the rest of his life, and the consequences will fall on Miss Quigley for the rest of her life.' He admitted that the actions of his client that night could be described as 'evil'. Mr Cohen said Sibbons has no memory of how he came to be at Miss Quigley's house that evening. However, Judge Radford said a large amount of money had been found after the teenager was arrested, adding: 'Another view could be that he was paid to undertake this.' He added: 'It was, in my judgment, a truly wicked offence, which clearly was pre-meditated.' He said Miss Quigley was an 'innocent young lady', with no connection to Sibbons, who has been left 'wholly affected' by his crime. 'You had absolutely no justification in doing what you did. Clearly, the victim will live with the consequences of what you did for the rest of her life,' said Judge Radford. He said Sibbons had refused to say why he had carried out the attack. The judge said: 'Clearly, you knew what you had done and knew that you were doing it. 'What you have not been prepared to do at any time, then or now, is tell the honest truth about how you came to commit this offence, how you obtained the acid and why you did it.' He said Sibbons was a drug user who was already known to the police before the events of April 30. Judge Radford gave Sibbons an extended sentence, meaning he will be on licence for two years after his release from custody, because he considers him to be a dangerous individual who poses 'significant risk' to the public.","Tara Quigley, 28, had to undergo two skin grafts after the attack .

An Asperger's syndrome sufferer who smothered his 91-year-old father to death before calmly feeding his cat then taking a shower has been jailed for life. Robert Cordingley, 57, from Bradford, admitted to murdering his father, George, in January by covering his face with a pillow wrapped in a bin liner. He then wandered to a police station to confess his crime but found it closed and went to a supermarket car park to find a uniformed officer. Cordingly's father, a widower who had been a well-known motorbike competitor, was found dead in a bedroom of the house he had shared with his son for 57 years. Cordingley, who was his father’s sole carer, had previously been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, a form of autism. Newcastle Crown Court heard that after killing his father he fed his cat and had a shower. The court also heard that there was evidence that suggested his father had begun to suffer from dementia. Mr Justice McCombe said: 'This is a very tragic and unusual case. 'The deceased was 91-years-old when he died and he had lived with the defendant for his whole life. 'There is evidence that he began to suffer from dementia but no help was sought. 'The defendant cared for his father by writing him notes to tell him where his food was and helped him prepare for the day. 'But a growing frustration was present with the defendant which led him to taking the decision to end his father’s life.' Carpark confession: Newcastle Crown Court heard that Cordingley then went to a police station to confess, but it was closed, so he approached police officers in a supermarket car park and told them he had murdered his father . The court heard that Cordingley’s condition led to poor judgment in finding a solution to his situation. Detective Inspector Steve Snow, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'It is hard to imagine what must have been going through Robert Cordingley’s mind when he ultimately decided to end his own father’s life. 'The evidence suggested that this was not a sophisticated plan, but one seemingly prompted out of desperation. 'A thorough and professional investigation was undertaken which clearly presented the facts and culminated in a guilty plea. 'Cordingley will now have to reflect on his decision, not only to take another life, but to subsequently ruin his own.'","Robert Cordingley, from Bradford, admitted murdering his father, George, in January by covering his face with a pillow wrapped in a bin liner .

The entertainer, who starts a UK tour in Bedford in three weeks’ time, added that the BBC has ‘finally gone mental’ over the Savile affair after making ‘a programme blaming the BBC’.

His comments come after Max Clifford claimed dozen of big name stars from the 1960s and 70s have called him 'frightened to death' they will become implicated in the widening Savile scandal. The PR guru said the stars were worried because at their peak they lived a hedonistic lifestyle where young girls threw themselves at them and they 'never asked for anybody's birth certificate'.

The husband of a woman and two children reportedly dead is now being eyed by Florida officials as a suspect in their deaths. Luis Toledo, 31, has been named a person of interest in the disappearance of wife Yessenia Suarez, 28, and children Michael Otto, 8, and Thalia Otto, 9. Officials have not found their bodies, but have confirmed they are deceased, according to WKMG. The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office is declining to say how they know the trio is dead, instead only confirming Mr Toledo is currently being interrogated and that he is known to be a gang member. Still not found: Yessenia Suarez, 28, and her children, 8-year-old Michael Otto and 9-year-old Thalia Otto disappeared earlier this week . ‘Keep in mind this is a very sensitive investigation and we want to be sure it comes to a satisfactory conclusion,’ a sheriff’s office spokesperson told the station. ‘We will make sure the family gets satisfaction when this is finally all over,’ he added. Last seen on Tuesday, police began looking into the disappearance of the mother and her children Wednesday, the station said. Mr Toledo was arrested Wednesday after . police checked in on Ms Suarez and her children following a domestic . violence incident at her workplace the previous day, the station noted. He had gone to Ms Suarez's office to confront her about text messages he found on her phone, according to ClickOrlando. He also wanted to speak to coworkers but could not find them, the station added. Such a tragedy: Micheal Otto (left) and Thalia Otto (right) have been confirmed dead by officials . A Florida missing child alert was issued for both children early Thursday. It is not clear if the children are from a previous marriage or relationship.

Characterized by the sheriff's office as a gang member, Mr Toledo has multiple arrests and has even served time in prison under an alias. He has multiple burglary, kidnapping and firearms charges brought against him in the past, according to ClickOrlando. Mr Toledo even served a four-year prison term under the name Michael Garcia.

Cheerleader: Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said public opposition to GM foods had softened . Consumers no longer care about the issue of GM crops, the Environment Secretary claims. Owen Paterson insisted genetically modified products should be cultivated and manufactured in Britain and said they would cut costs for hard-pressed shoppers. Mr Paterson, a Government cheerleader for the technology, which Britain has resisted, said consumers had accepted a move to allow shops to sell meat from animals raised on GM feed, suggesting public opposition had softened. He added: ‘It is impossible to detect. If an animal, a chicken or a pig, has eaten GM material, you can’t tell. The fact that the public didn’t react to that was very interesting.’ His latest intervention prompted an . angry response from anti-GM campaigners, who accused him of . misrepresenting the evidence and taking voters’ views for granted. Mr . Paterson, in an interview for political magazine, The House, said . consumers had happily accepted a move to allow meat from animals fed on . GM animal feed, suggesting controversy had dimmed. ‘I thought it was . very interesting when some of the main retailers [Tesco and others] felt . that they could no longer tell their consumers that they were selling . meat products which had not consumed GM material at some stage because . nearly all our animal feed now has contained some GM. ‘Of course it . is undetectable, it is impossible to detect. If an animal, a chicken or a . pig has eaten GM material, you can’t tell. I thought the fact that the . public didn’t react to that was very interesting.’ The minister insisted . that GM had been grown across much of the rest of the world for many . years and there were no reports of any adverse impact. ‘There are 17 . million farmers cultivating 170m hectares which is 12 per cent of the . world’s arable land, which is seven times the surface area of the UK and . not a single person has come to me with a report of any health . problem,’ he said. ‘The fact that every single member of the House of . Commons has been on holiday to America and has come back happily, . healthy and sane shows that this is a technology which can feed the . world. It’s not the only solution but it is a very valuable technology.’ The Environment Secretary, who is thought to want GM products . widely available on supermarket shelves by the end of the decade, added: . ‘It would be good to grow some GM crops in this country because some of . these products would be cheaper which helps our consumers, who are . under a lot of pressure. We all know the cost of living and the cost of . food has become an issue.’ He also claimed there were ‘massive . environmental gains’. ‘There are huge reductions in spraying... there . would be massive savings in pretty strong chemicals which we spray the . whole time, huge savings in diesel, huge savings in compaction of soil, . there’s no doubt about it. That’s a straight help to agriculture.’ Mr . Paterson also saidn ‘agritechnology’, which covers GM crops and . conventional crop manipulation, represents a major business opportunity . for Britain and was an industry in which the country should become a . world leader. ‘We have top class research institutions... when I was . in Germany I was talking to other companies and I would love them to . come here. 'This doesn’t have to be GM. We are looking at a . conventional wheat development which could increase the yield of wheat . by 25 per cent, I would love that to be done here. Criticism: Opponents of Mr Paterson said adopting GM food could harm Britain's reputation . ‘I would like the . UK to become the leading nation in Europe for agritechnology. I would . really like to go a whole step further.’ Mr Paterson insisted that . products were being cleared by watchdogs for human consumption, but then . blocked across Europe because of political resistance. ‘Time and . again, products pass through the very rigorous scientific process and . then get stuck at the political level. So we are talking at member state . level to other member states to see if we can get this moving. Because . at the moment Europe is going to fall further and further behind,’ he . said. Mr Paterson caused controversy earlier this month when he said . millions of children in the developing world are ‘dying or going blind’ because GM crops, some of which are desgined to boost vitamin content, . have not been more widely adopted. Dr Helen Wallace, of GeneWatch, . which campaigns to ensure any use of GM is in the public interest, said: . ‘There would be a massive disadvantage to Britain’s reputation for good . farming if we grew GM crops in Britain. ‘The evidence shows that GM . crops which are resistant to weedkillers actually increase the amount of . spraying which harms wildlife. Polls show that the public wants meat, . milk and dairy products fed on GM animal feed to be labelled. Then we . would have a better gauge of whether people actually want to buy it. ‘I . think Owen Paterson will be surprised by the reaction if he tries to . have GM crops grown in this country. There are still very many people . who are strongly opposed to this technology, and growing them here would . cause a big backlash.’ Due to the controversy when GM technology . was first adopted in the 1990s, there are only a handful of products . containing GM crops currently available on British high streets. Currently, there are no commercial GM crops in Britain, but livestock is commonly reared on imported GM feed. But . the Prime Minister, the Government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Mark . Walport, and Science Minister David Willetts have all voiced support . for GM. The scientific community also overwhelmingly supports its wider . use, with experts insisting each product must be judged on its merits . rather than damning a whole technology.","Owen Paterson said public opposition to GM food has softened .

They've been underpinning style since 1886 and lingerie makers Triumph have proved they still remain at the forefront of fashion after being named as the official supplier of underwear at London Fashion Week. To celebrate their second collaboration with the British Fashion Council, Triumph have teamed up with designers including Matthew Williamson and  Fyodor Golan who have created their own unique customisations of their underwear. The designers' styles will be on display at a special pop up event, 'Maison Triumph', in Covent Garden, London next week. But for fashionistas not able to get to the capital, Femail have been given a sneak pic of some of the designs which you can view below. Runway ready: Matthew Williamson's drawing of his red lingerie, left, brought to life using sumptuous fabric and embellished with sequins and feathers . The pop up centre will also house an . exhibition revealing Triumph's styles across the decades since they were . established in 1886 by merchant Michael Braun and corset-maker Johann . Gottfried Spiesshofer. From humble beginnings with . just six sewing machines and six employees at their factory in southern . Germany, they have gone on to become the world's leading lingerie . manufacturers with a presence in more than 120 countries and 37,500-plus employees. Creative: Fyodor Golan's drawing of their unique design for the brand with feminine frills and ruffles . In . the beginning, their production focused on corsets that emphasised the . bust and derriere while tautly shaping the waist and hips in line with . what was considered the perfect female shape during the Victorian era. The . company faced a challenge to their business in the 1920s when the . corset began to fall out of favour as female fashion began to change . radically and boyish shapes and the bra became more popular. They moved with the times and began . developing new ranges of underwear including bras with front fastenings . and adjustable straps. More than a century ago: The brand began creating corsets in line with demand for women to have nipped in waists . Evolving style: The company has had to move with the times and changes in fashion - a London exhibition next week will chronicle the journey . Further developments in line with . style tastes, their own innovations and incorporating new fabrics like . Lycra, continued through the swinging sixties to the present day - with . their signature corsets continually coming in and out of fashion again. Visitors . to the pop event can see this style evolution played out in the . exhibition that includes some of the images you can view here. When fuller figures reigned supreme: This conical creation reflected the Fifties fashion for a full bust and wide hips . Underpinning style: The lingerie makers have been supporting women since 1886 . There will also be a number of other special events at the pop up store including a question and answer sessions with industry experts including model-turned-designer Helena Christensen, who will unveil a sneak peek of her autumn/winter collection for the brand. And of course visitors won't have to leave empty-handed as they'll be able to shop the look with capsule collections available to purchase. Matthew Williamson designed T-shirt .

Suspect: Jacob Salas, 32, was charged with causing injury to a foster child but could face more serious offences . The biological father of an 11-month-old girl killed while in foster care claims he warned Texas officials she was in danger. Brian Hamilton, father of Orien Hamilton, warned authorities one month ago that his daughter was in trouble because Jacob Salas has a history of abuse. The toddler died Saturday after the abusive man pinned her head to the floor with his knee, and officials are at a loss to explain how Mr Salas' history of abuse fell through the cracks. The young girl was removed from her San Antonio home four months ago after investigators found methamphetamine in her system, she was placed in the Austin home of Mr Salas' ex-wife. Formerly married to the toddler's aunt, and having fathered three children with her, the former prison guard was accused in 2004, 2005 and 2012 of abuse, according to KVUE. In the wake of the abusive ex-prison guard, according to KXAN, crushing the baby's skull until it died, Child Protective Services is scrambling to find an explanation. 'There were two different parties who questioned the foster mother about Jacob Salas living in her home,' a spokesperson told KVUE. 'She denied it and told both Child Protective Services and the attorney that he was living out of state, she added, 'the CPS case worker at that point in time was satisfied with the answer.' Mr Salas driver's license is registered to the address where paramedics rushed Saturday after receiving a call that a baby was choking, KVUE revealed. 'Whether or not we could've, should have done more is a question - it's something that we missed,' the spokesperson added, 'it's obvious.' State officials have since removed the three children, all under the age of eight, from the home, according to YNN. They are currently staying with a relative. Looking after the child while the foster parent was at work, Mr Salas was arrested after admitting to police he may have caused the child's injuries. Awful: Orien Hamilton was taken from her home to protect her safety, only for her to die while in foster care . The 32-year-old dialed 911 on Saturday, claiming the toddler was choking on a piece of food. She was then taken to Dell Children's Hospital in Austin, Texas, where she later passed away, according to reports. But when officers began questioning Mr Salas, they found his account was inconsistent with the child’s injuries after police found bruising on her left ear, officials said. The appalling crime shocked even veteran police. '""It's very rare that we have a case that is this sensitive,' Cedar Park Police Department Captain Darlene Lewis told KXAN. 'It's very hard on everyone involved, including the personnel that responded to the scene,' she added. An inglorious end to an unfairly short life: The toddler died at Dell Children's Hospital, in Austin, Texas . Cops charged Mr Salas with injury to a child and are working with the Williamson County District Attorney's office to determine whether he will face more serious offenses. The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) said the toddler was placed in a San . Antonio foster home until December last year. She was then transferred to her . aunt’s home in Cedar Park because of the state's policy which urges foster children are places with their relatives. The . Lutheran Social Services (LSS) said Ms Hamilton's aunt was called into . work and was not in the house at the time of the tragic incident. She had only become an authorized caretaker two weeks ago, according to KXAN. Mr Salas was not an approved caretaker, the station noted. Scene: The 11-month-old Orien Hamilton was being looked after by Salas at this house in Cedar Parks in Austin, Texas . The . agency said they were also not aware Salas cared for the child until . they received the call informing them of what had happened. Both . DFPS and LSS conducted a background check on Hamiton’s aunt. The . child’s aunt was verified as a foster parent by LSS on Oct. 7. LSS . said they will conduct their own comprehensive investigation into the . incident. DFPS said they are investigating the agency’s actions in the . case as well. A CPS spokesperson claimed children are not often killed while in foster care, despite a five dying of abuse or neglect in just the last few weeks, and a total of eight in the fiscal year ending Aug 31, according to the Dallas Morning News. A total of 29 children died while in foster care in Texas in the last fiscal year, a dramatic increase from 18 the previous year. Mr Salas remains in county jail and faces the possibility of a capital murder charge in connection with the toddler's death.Texas is the most aggressive state in use of the death penalty for capital murder convictions. It is not clear if the girl's aunt will face any charges for lying to officials about Mr Salas.","Orien Hamilton died after being taken to hospital with severe head injuries .

There once was a time when American workers loved nothing more than to celebrate the end of a hard day's graft by blowing the froth off a few cold beers. Just two decades ago beer was by far the most popular alcoholic drink across the country. But now trouble is brewing in the beer business as Americans appear to be turning their backs on ale for a more refined taste of wine... and bottled water. The beer years: Just two decades ago beer was by far the most popular alcoholic drink across the country . A new report by Gallup has revealed that in the last 20 years, per capita beer consumption has plummeted across the US by 20 per cent. In its place, wine, tea and liquor have enjoyed a bumper decade while milk, soft drinks and juice are increasingly being left at the back of the fridge. But the runaway success over the last ten years is bottled water as health-conscious Americans battle to live longer and look better. Oh beer! Per capita beer consumption has dropped from 47 per cent in 1992 to 36 per cent today while wine and spirits enjoyed a rise from 27 per cent and 21 per cent respectively to 35 per cent and 23 per cent . Wine not? Americans appear to be turning their backs on ale for the rather more refined taste of wine . Water good idea: But the runaway success over the last . ten years appears to be bottled water as health-conscious Americans . battle to live longer and look better, like Britney Spears, left, and actor Al Pacino, right . Back on the bottle: The report has revealed that in the last 20 years, per capita beer consumption has plummeted while the nation's taste for bottled water, wine and spirits has soared . 'You're seeing that the consumer is taking a healthier look and having more alternatives [than soda], such as tea, and coconut water,' Thomas Mullarkey, an analyst from Morningstar, told The Atlantic. 'But also, Americans have aged, and soft drinks are most popular among teenagers and twentysomethings.' The biggest drop in beer was among young Americans and non-whites - the two fastest-growing demographics of US society. According to the report, young adult drinkers' alcoholic drink preferences have changed dramatically over the past two decades. Time at the bar: There once was a time when American workers loved nothing more than to celebrate the end of a hard day's graft by blowing the froth off a few cold beers . In the early 1990s, 71 per cent of adults under the age of 30 said they drank beer most often, whereas that umber has dropped to 41 per cent. For the same age group, 14 per cent said they liked wine and 13 per cent spirits in 1992 compared to 24 per cent and 28 per cent respectively now. The survey's other findings include: . But while beer-drinking has fallen in the U.S. as a whole, it has increased in some states - for instance, it actually increased in Vermont by seven per cent over the last three years. In October, the Beer Institute revealed New Hampshire as the biggest beer-swilling state where residents drink on average 43 gallons of beer a year each. The Granite State was followed by North Dakota (42.2 gallons), Montana (40.6 gallons), South Dakota (38 gallons) and Nevada (36.5 gallons).","Two decades ago beer was America's most popular alcoholic drink .

Gruesome sight: Relatives of Christina Hammond, who died in 2007, said a mortuary left her body in the open with blood sipping out of her mouth . A Washington state family claim that the same funeral home that made national headlines this week after allegedly cremating the wrong body also mishandled the remains of their deceased relative. Brown Mortuary in Chehalis found itself in the center of a media storm after reports came out accusing the funeral home of mixing up the body of Jerry Moon with that of an elderly hospice patient, and then mistakenly cremating Moon in violation of his wishes. For Tracy Scott and her daughter Carrie Hammond, the story hit close to home, reminding them of a traumatic experience they had at the mortuary after the death of Scott’s eldest daughter, Christina. ‘We feel their pain. We know their pain and we care,’ Miss Scott told KOMO News of Jerry Moon’s family. ‘These kind of mistakes just can’t happen.’ In 2007, 28-year-old mother Christina Hammond went in for a routine gallbladder surgery, which resulted in her death when her heart stopped while she was on the operating table. When the family arrived at the mortuary ahead of Hammond's cremation, they said they were greeted by an arrogant employee who showed them no compassion in their hour of grief. But the worst part came when Scott and Carrie Hammond approached Christina's body, only to discover a grisly sight. Scroll down for video . No closure: The 28-year-old mother was cremated and her ashes were sent to her family along with a bag of jewelry that did not belong to her, leaving her family with unanswered questions . Young mother: Miss Hammond, pictured left and right with her son, died when her heart stopped during a gallbladder surgery in June 2007 . ‘She had blood running down her face and onto her shirt,’ Scott recalled. 'I went in and got the guy and he just laughed it off.’ Carrie said that even after her sister’s face had been wiped off, more blood continued trickling out of her mouth. Nightmare scenario: Miss Hammond's sister, Carrie, recalled being horrified at the sight of Christina's blood-spattered face . Miss Hammond said prior to that she . had never been in a funeral home, but she is certain a person's body is . not supposed to look the way her sister did in that moment. ‘It’s like a nightmare. That’s all you . see,’ she said. ‘The viewing is supposed to have closure, and when a . body looks that way...it’s no good.’ Following Miss Hammond's cremation, the family received her ashes from the mortuary along with a bag of jewelery. The valuables, however, did not belong to the deceased woman, leaving her relatives to wonder if the funeral home had cremated the wrong body. ‘Did we just get somebody else's jewelry, or did we get somebody else's remains?’ Scott said. Scott said she sent a complaint to Dignity Memorial, which owns Brown Mortuary, but did not receive a response. The revelations come just days after the family of Jerry Moon opened his casket to bid him a final farewell Monday, only to discover the body of a stranger with a plastic bag over his head. The mix-up appears to have happened when Brown Mortuary took possession of Moon's body after his death. Dead wrong: Jerry Moon's family was aghast when the found another man's body in their father's coffin . Around that same time, the mortuary also took possession of the body of a 97-year-old man who died in hospice care. Somehow, the bodies were mixed up. 'This makes me feel like he was treated as a number, not a person,' daughter Cheryl Moon told KIROTV.com. According to family members, Moon's funeral was a touching goodbye to the man they loved. At the end of the service, they opened the casket. Oops: It's believed the Brown Mortuary mistakenly put the body of a 97-year-old man in Moon's coffinAnother gruesome mix-up reported at Chehalis mortuary . 'I turned around and said to myself three times, '‘That’s not him, that’s not him, that’s not him,'” son Randy Moon told the station. Inside the casket was the other man - dressed in Jerry Moon's clothes and with a picture of Moon's wife tucked under the pillow in the coffin. Making things even worse, Moon was terrified of being cremated. But because of the mix-up, the funeral home cremated his body thinking it was that of the other man. Grieving: Moon's son Randy says he believes his father is in Heaven, regardless of who was in the casket . 'The only other thing I can say is we know where he really is,' Randy Moon said. 'We’re a believing family, and we believe he is in heaven.'","Christina Hammond, 28, died in 2007 during gallbladder surgery and was supposed to be cremated at Brown Mortuary in Chehalis, Washington .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 23:54 EST, 24 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:46 EST, 25 October 2013 . A 29-year-old Iraq War Veteran from Alabama has pleaded guilty in federal court to a charge that he tried to hire phony KKK members to kill his African-American neighbor for raping his wife. Allen Morgan, of Munford, entered his plea Thursday at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Karon O. Bowdre. The veteran, who allegedly suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, was charged last month with using and causing someone else to use interstate facilities with the intent to commit murder-for-hire. Confession: Disabled veteran Allen Morgan (left) pleaded guilty to trying to hire a pair of FBI agents posing as KKK members to kill his neighbor Clifford Mosley (right) as retribution for raping his wife . Serious claims: Morgan's wife accused Mosley, who is a convicted sex offender, of raping her in August . Bowdre scheduled sentencing for Morgan for February 27. He faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Court documents said Morgan was arrested in August after he told undercover officers, whom he believed to be Ku Klux KIan members, that he would pay them to murder a neighbor whom Morgan's wife had accused of raping her. Morgan’s Facebook page last updated in August lists him as separated. The 29-year-old former soldier has a daughter. However, the wife's social media account includes several recent photographs of the couple together. The woman’s name is being withheld because she may be the victim of a sex crime. A federal affidavit states that an undercover FBI agent called Morgan August 22 pretending to be a KKK member, asking him if he was looking to hire someone to kill his neighbor, who he believed had raped his wife. Morgan told the agent that he had just confronted the man, Clifford Mosley, and fired several warning shots from his wife's semiautomatic pistol at the ground to scare him. Grisly death: Morgan told an FBI officer pretending to be a gun-for-hire that he wanted his neighbor gutted, dismembered and left to die in a tree like 'an animal' Rendezvous: Morgan met August 25 with the would-be assassin and his accomplice at this motel in Oxford, Alabama, where he was arrested after handing the agents a watch and necklace as payment for the killing . Online records show that Mosley, 40, is a registered sex offender who was convicted in 2009 for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl. The veteran allegedly told the would-be hit man that his family were behind his plan to kill the neighbor, saying that his wife's parents wanted 'to dynamite the entire block.' According to the court document, Morgan described in graphic detail how he wanted Mosley murdered, saying that he wanted him 'hung from a tree like he is an animal.' 'I want his d*** cut off and I want him cut,' Morgan allegedly said on the call. The 29-year-old went on, according to the affidavit, stating that he wanted his wife's alleged assailant to 'die a slow painful death' after being ‘gutted.’ Morgan and the undercover officer concluded the conversation by agreeing to meet in person three days later. The FBI agent said he will bring along a partner who would help him carry out the plot. At around 3.30pm on August 25, Morgan and two FBI agents pretending to be guns-for-hire met at the Econo Lodge Motel in Oxford to discuss payment for the contract on Mosley's head. Warrior: Morgan (right) returned from Iraq in 2005, suffering from physical injuries and severe post-traumatic stress disorder that triggered in him suicidal thoughts . Healing through music: Last year, Morgan joined a band called The Hellmand Project comprised of other veterans grappling with psychological disorders . In the course of the meeting, the 29-year-old said that because he is a disabled veteran, he had no money to pay the hit men. Instead, he offered the undercover officers a watch and a necklace, and also promised to bring them a gun from home in lieu of cash. Morgan furnished the fake clansmen with a map to his neighbor’s home and his physical description. At that point, the suspect was taken into custody. During questioning, Morgan confessed to the murder-for-hire plot. Allen Morgan served in Ar Ramadi, the capital of al-Anbar province, which was described as the most dangerous place in Iraq in a 2006 Time Magazine article. He returned from Iraq in 2005 suffering from severe PTSD that triggered suicidal thoughts and drove him to substance abuse, according to AL.com. Last year, Morgan, who plays guitar, joined a band called The Hellmand Project comprised of veterans grappling with PTSD.","Allen Morgan, 29, of Alabama, faces up to two years in prison and $250,000 fine in the murder-for-hire plot .

Mark Sanford, the disgraced former South Carolina governor, is engaged to the Argentinian mistress who cost him his political career. Sanford, 52, surprised journalist María Belén Chapur last week with a wedding proposal in Buenos Aires that left them both crying and promising to stay together forever. The Republican politician was considered a rising star and a possible presidential contender until he disappeared for six days in 2009 and returned to reveal he had been meeting Miss Chapur in secret in Argentine. Together forever: Former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford has pursued a relationship with María Belén Chapur. The couple are seen here in Uruguay in 2011 . Cheesy: Sanford had the waiter at an upscale restaurant give the engagement ring to Miss Chapur while he hid in the bathroom . Sanford confirmed to CNN that he had, indeed, proposed. 'Yes, we are engaged, and I’m both happy and excited for what that means, I have long expressed my feelings for her, she’s a wonderful person. My closest friends have met and love her, and I look forward to introducing her to still many more that have yet to do so,' he said. In a 2009 interview after the news of the affair broke, Sanford referred to Miss Chapur as his 'soul mate' and admitted he had 'cross the line' with other women before. His wife Jenny moved their four sons out of the governor's mansion after his admission. She divorced him less than a year later. Over: Sanford's affair ended his political career and his marriage to his wife Jenny (right), who divorced him in January 2010 -- six months after the scandal erupted . Argentinian news site Clarin reports . that Sanford proposed at the Bella Italia Grill in the upscale Palermo . neighborhood of Buenos Aires. He arrived at the restaurant early and gave waiter the engagement ring in a bag and told him to make up a good story. Sanford . then hid in the bathroom and watched as the waiter told Miss Chapur she . was the 100th customer of the day and had won a prize. Sanford then emerged from hiding and surprised the Argentinian beauty. The pair gushed as they hugged and kissed and cried together in the restaurant. They promised to stay together forever, Clarin reports. Sanford's soaring political career came to a screeching halt in 2009, when reports began questioning his disappearance for six days. Aides claimed he was 'hiking the Appalachians' and was out of touch. Left behind: Jenny Sanford moved herself and her four sons out of the governor's mansion in the days after the affair . However, a reporter caught him at the Atlanta airport leaving a flight from Buenos Aires and he shortly thereafter admitted the affair. Sanford said he met Miss Chapur, a divorced mother of two, during a trade mission in 2001 in Uruguay, though their relationship didn't turn romantic until 2008. Sanford reimbursed the state for one previous trip to Argentina that had been billed as a taxpayer funded trade mission. He was censured by the state legislature, though he avoided impeachment and stayed in office until January 2011, when his term expired.","Mark Sanford and María Belén Chapur promised to stay together forever after the proposal at an upscale restaurant .

He has called for all teachers who work full-time in free schools to have teaching certificates . Nick Clegg was mocked yesterday after it emerged that none of his own teachers would be allowed to teach in free schools under rules he wants to introduce. The Deputy Prime Minister attended the prestigious Westminster School where, in common with other private schools, teachers are not required to hold teaching qualifications. Yet Mr Clegg wants all teachers who work full-time in free schools to have teaching certificates, even if they have years of experience. Yesterday he was confronted over how . none of the teachers who propelled him to Cambridge and into a . high-flying career would have been able to teach at a free school under . his rules. Mr . Clegg also provoked controversy by insisting that there should be . different rules for independent schools because parents paid the fees . and took ‘their chances’. Westminster currently charges £32,000 . annually. LBC . Radio host Nick Ferrari asked Mr Clegg if he remembered his English . teacher Jim Cogan – ‘a former Royal Marine who didn’t have the relevant . piece of paper’. ‘I understand you were very close to him,’ Mr Ferrari said. Mr . Clegg was asked about David Cook, who studied history and was in charge . of tuition to get pupils into Oxford and Cambridge, but also ‘didn’t . have the piece of paper’. His classics teacher Theo Zinn was also technically unqualified. Mr Clegg said he remembered all of them, including Mr Cogan who ‘sadly died some years ago’. The Deputy Prime Minister attended the prestigious Westminster School where, in common with other private schools, teachers are not required to hold teaching qualifications . He . added: ‘I’m amazed at anyone thinking it is a controversial statement . to say that across 23,000 state-funded schools we should have some basic . quality standards which provide a guarantee if you like, a reassurance . to parents in the years to come.’ But one Coalition MP, who did not want to be named, said Mr Clegg was adopting a ‘condescending’ tone. Education Secretary Michael Gove believes headmasters at free schools and academies should have the same rights as those in private schools to hire untrained teachers if they are the best candidates . ‘He seems to be suggesting that parents who send their kids to state schools need help in discerning between good and bad teachers, while those who send their kids private already know that so don’t need the guarantee,’ the MP said. Mr Clegg has triggered a row with the Conservatives over the more relaxed rules for free schools. Education Secretary Michael Gove believes headmasters at free schools and academies should have the same rights as those in private schools to hire untrained teachers if they are the best candidates. Mr Clegg said: ‘Freedom does not mean anarchy. There’s laws that they have to abide by. Just because you’ve got qualified teacher status doesn’t mean you’re the greatest teacher ever. But it provides a certain basic quality standard.’ Asked whether his own intervention had caused a ‘Coalition crisis’, he told LBC: ‘I’m perfectly entitled to talk without being shouted down about my vision of the future of the schools system.’ Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt said: ‘Labour has been very clear: All teachers must be qualified. So next week we will call a vote in Parliament to make sure teachers in our classrooms have the proper qualifications. ‘For Nick Clegg it’s always “believe what I say, not what I do”. Time and again his actions have shown that the Lib Dems cannot be trusted. So let’s see where he stands when we put him on the spot in Parliament next week.’ THEODORE ZINN: Fluent in Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian, the classicist could reel off vast tracts of Homer and Horace and would choose books he liked over what was required for the A-level curriculum. His impressive physical presence matched his theatrical teaching style – when he struggled to get a class under control he would often burst into tears, shocking his pupils into silence. He has written several books to help pupils pass exams in Latin. JAMES ‘JIM’ COGAN: The English teacher and former deputy head of Westminster School was loved for his humorous approach to lessons which were filled with passionate debate. Former pupils say he inspired them with his fondness for Shakespeare and knew poetry off by heart. As a young man he served in Nigeria with the West African Frontier Force then read Greats at Corpus Christi, Oxford, before changing to English. He taught English at Westminster for 35 years until 1999. He died aged 70 in 2007. DAVID COOK: The history teacher was responsible for getting pupils into Oxford and Cambridge. He studied history at King’s College, London, and Lincoln College, Oxford, but had no official teaching qualification. He became housemaster, head of sport and head of history. Mr Cook also went on to set up international branches of Britain’s top independent schools including Wellington College and Repton. TRISTRAM JONES-PARRY: A ‘terrifying but brilliant’ maths teacher who went on to be headmaster at Westminster after Mr Clegg had left. Former pupils described how he actually explained how maths worked rather than simply drilling formulae into them. He retired at 58 and was prepared to offer his services to state schools – but was banned because he lacked the necessary teaching qualification. RICHARD STOKES: The German teacher worked at Bedales before going on to teach at Westminster for 30 years. Last year he was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for ‘great service rendered to British-German relations’. DAVID HEPBURNE-SCOTT: Known as the best physics teacher in the school, he could make pupils laugh by comparing thermodynamics theory with the making of a crème brulee. He was also a housemaster.","The Deputy Prime Minister attended the prestigious Westminster School .

The long squeeze on the incomes of millions of families is coming to an end, George Osborne said yesterday, as growth figures showed the recovery is gathering pace. The Office for National Statistics said Britain’s economy grew by 0.8 per cent between July and September, the fastest rate recorded since the election. Ministers seized on the figures as evidence that the Government’s austerity plan – which was bitterly opposed by Labour – is now bearing fruit. Let the good times roll? Chancellor George Osborne visits AW Hainsworth and Sons textile manufacturer in Leeds as figures show the recovery gaining momentum . Gains: Output in manufacturing is still 8.9 per cent lower than pre-recession levels, despite growing by 0.5 per cent in the latest quarter . The Chancellor said the recovery meant better times are in sight for millions of families who have seen their incomes squeezed since the 2008 crash. ‘Britain’s hard work is paying off,’ he said, adding: ‘If Britain is growing, then the finances of Britain’s families will start to grow.’ But Mr Osborne also warned that ‘lots of risks remain’, and said there was still a long way to go to eliminate the vast budget deficit left by Labour. David Cameron said the growth figure was ‘not just a number on a graph’, but evidence that a sustained recovery is finally underway. The Prime Minister said he was determined that the benefits of growth would be shared by all parts of the country. ‘The GDP figures out today do show our economy has real momentum,’ he said. ‘They show that we are on a path to prosperity. Boost: The British economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said today . Alex Brummer . George Osborne has every right to . declare Britain is back on the path  to prosperity after the economy . recorded robust growth across the board in the three months to . September. Remarkably, Britain is now among the fastest expanding of the G7 nations, easily outpacing rivals such as Germany and France. The . main driving force behind surging output is the service sector, which . comprises 75 per cent of the economy. That has now moved ahead of where . it was at the peak of Gordon Brown’s boom in 2008. The . turnabout in economic fortunes will come as a huge relief to the . Government, which has found itself on the back foot for the last week as . Britain’s Big Six energy firms raised prices. Labour’s . grudging response to nine months of solid output growth was to . acknowledge it as ‘good news’. But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls could not . resist a dig, noting that for millions ‘standards of living are going . down, not up’. What . Balls forgets to say is that in the UK, unlike most of Europe, austerity . has been far less painful because employers have had the confidence to . expand the workforce. Some 1.4million private sector jobs have been . created since the Coalition came to office in 2010. The . faster the economy recovers, the better businesses will do and the . easier it will be to restore living standards through honestly earned . wage increases – rather than subsidy and welfare dependency. By far the . biggest net contributor to the UK’s economic renaissance is business . services – a sector often dismissed as coffee shops and haircuts. But . the reality is that it comprises IT, legal and accounting work, . engineering consultancy and architecture as well as some of the leading . creative industries. Many of these sell products overseas. The . figures also give the lie to the idea of a recovery built on a housing . bubble. While both housing and construction are gaining momentum, . growing by 2.5 per cent over the past three months, they are still 12.5 . per cent below the peak of the Blair-Brown bubble in 2008. There is also some evidence that the economy is starting to rebalance, with manufacturing perking up by 0.9 per cent. The . return to expansion is all the more encouraging in that the rest of . Europe (the UK’s biggest trading partner) is still in slump and the US . economy has been subsiding amid serious budget uncertainty. Mr . Osborne will, for the first time since becoming Chancellor, have far . better growth forecasts to present in his autumn statement on December . 4. There may even be a better outcome for the budget deficit as consumer . and income tax receipts pick up. ‘We’ve got a huge amount more to do to secure that recovery. Above all, our work here in Europe and at home is about making sure it is a recovery for all – a recovery for north and south, for rich and poor, for people who have been excluded from our economy.’ The strengthening recovery is a major blow to the strategy of Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who has repeatedly warned the Government’s austerity programme would strangle growth. Yesterday Mr Balls gave the ONS figures a cautious welcome, but warned that most families are still not feeling the benefit. Squeeze: The Consumer Prices Index shows the cost of living is up 2.7 per cent, while wages are rising by less than one per cent . Mr Balls said: ‘For millions of people across the country, still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all.’ Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable also struck a cautious note, saying: ‘We’ve always said the road to recovery would be a marathon, not a sprint.’ Economic growth in the third quarter of this year is the fastest since spring 2010, built on 0.7 per cent growth in the second quarter of the year and 0.4 per cent in the first three months. Ridicule: The Tories will take aim at Labour in an internet cartoon film entitled 'Mystic Ed, The World's Worst Clairvoyant' Falling: Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show how the government is on course to borrow less this year than last year . The ONS report showed all the main strands of the economy growing, with output in the dominant services sector up 0.7 per cent, manufacturing 0.9 per cent and construction 2.5 per cent. Analysts said housebuilding was boosted by a surge in mortgage lending on the back of state-supported schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy. But the economy is still 2.5 per cent smaller than it was in 2008 when boom turned to bust under Labour. Struggling: Inflation is higher in the UK than anywhere else in Europe, with food and energy driving up costs . Output shrank by 7.2 per cent in the recession and Britain remains trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century. The recent revival in Britain’s economic fortunes has fuelled speculation that an early rise in interest rates is on the cards. But, speaking on Thursday night just hours before the GDP figures were published, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the economy still lacks enough ‘traction’ to warrant a rate increase. Big rises in energy prices are ‘morally wrong’ David Cameron said yesterday as senior sources said he was preparing to slash the average bill by £50. The Prime Minister took aim at the Big Six energy companies, accusing them of putting up bills by far more than the amount wholesale gas prices have risen. At a press conference in Brussels, Mr Cameron confirmed he wants to remove onerous green levies from the cost of fuel to cut prices for families. But he also admitted the costs were likely to be passed to general taxation.nPower has announced it will increase energy bills by 10.4 per cent from December, while British Gas, Scottish Power and SSE have all announced rises of between 8 and 9 per cent this winter. Asked if such rises were ‘morally wrong’ when wholesale prices have risen by 3 per cent in recent months, Mr Cameron said: ‘On power bills, I think it is wrong for bills to go up when wholesale prices are not going up substantially.’ The controversial HS2 rail line ‘can’t go ahead’ if Labour withdraws its support, David Cameron admitted yesterday. The Prime Minister, who also faces a major Tory rebellion on the £42billion project next week, said the scheme could collapse unless it retains all-party support. He said: ‘These multi-year, multi-parliament infrastructure projects, they can’t go ahead without all-party support, we won’t get the investment, we can’t have the consistency.’ Speculation is mounting that Labour is preparing to drop its backing for the project, which began life under the last Labour government. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls yesterday said it was ‘irresponsible’ of ministers to pledge to press ahead regardless of cost. Labour sources say Ed Miliband has ‘sub-contracted’ the final decision on HS2 to Mr Balls. Mr Cameron warned Labour would damage Britain’s long-term prospects if it pulled the plug on the scheme. He said they  would be ‘letting down’ the Midlands and the North and would be turning their backs on business.","Third quarter data follows growth of 0.4% and 0.7% already this year .

Jailed: Luke Nicholson, 29, waded past Cheryl Slim's parents with knives to strangle their daughter . A 'mild-mannered' primary school assistant who stabbed his ex-girlfriend’s parents before strangling their daughter during a horrific suburban nightmare has been jailed. Luke Nicholson, 29, who had never been in trouble with the police before, attacked Cheryl Slim's father on the doorstep of her family home, before slashing her mother in the living room, and trying to strange his former girlfriend in the back garden. Schoolteacher Cheryl, 30, who broke up with Nicholson five years ago, tried to escape from the upstairs bathroom window but was accosted by her attacker when she fell. She did not realise it was her former boyfriend until he was strangling her. Struggling for breath, she tried to play dead but Nicholson only released his grip and fled when the next-door neighbour smashed through the garden fence to stop him. Nicholson, of Sevenoaks, Kent, who assisted primary school children with special needs, pleaded guilty to three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, in relation to Robert Slim, 59, Annette Slim, 55, and Cheryl on January 24. The prosecution found the defendant had attempted to make Facebook contact with his ex of five years, and made other internet searches for her in the period before the attack. Croydon Crown Court was told the defendant rode his moped twenty miles in the snow, buying the knives from Tesco’s on the way. He ended up outside the Slim’s family home in Beckenham, where he once spent Christmas years before. Mr Slim described Nicholson as having a 'vacant, emotionless expression' when he answered the door to him. He was stabbed in the upper arm without warning - slashing his artery - and sustained further injuries as they fought in the hallway. Traumatised: Attack victims Cheryl Slim, 30, and her father Robert Slim, 59, leave Croydon Crown Court . Victims: Mr Slim was stabbed in the artery and his wife Annette, 55, was stabbed in the hand by Nicholson . Mrs Slim emerged from the living-room, where the couple had been watching television, and smashed Nicholson over the head with a plant pot several times without effect. 'He turned his attention to Mrs Slim and she tried to grab the knife from his hand,' explained prosecutor Mr Patrick Moran. 'In the ensuing struggle the defendant lashed out at her several times with the knife.' She suffered severed tendons to one of her hands as she successfully prized the knife from Nicholson, who then began hunting the house for Cheryl, leaving a trail of bloody footprints up to the bathroom, where she had locked herself in. 'Fearing that someone would break through the bathroom door to find her she opened the bathroom window and climbed out of it,' added Mr Moran. 'The window overlooked the back garden and it was into that garden Miss Slim fell as she tried to lower herself from the edge. 'No sooner had she got up than the defendant tackled her back to the ground and smashed a hard object against her head - possibly a garden ornament. 'The defendant then dragged Miss Slim down to the end of the garden, further from her parents, who had no idea that the defendant had her, quite literally, in his grip. 'She struggled on the ground underneath the defendant as he gripped her neck and it was only at that stage that she believed she recognised her attacker as a former boyfriend. Home: The family home, where Nicholson spent Christmas five years ago. A neighbour intervened mid-attack . 'She was struggling to breathe as she felt her windpipe being crushed and sought to defend herself by clawing at the defendant’s face. 'Miss Slim could do little more to defend herself, as she felt as if she was losing consciousness, and decided to stop struggling and lie still.' After the neighbour disturbed the heavily bloodstained Nicholson he made his way back through the blood-splattered house, past Mr Slim, who had collapsed on the kitchen floor from excessive bleeding, and out the front door. Police stopped him a few street away and an obviously drunken Nicholson said: 'I don’t know what you are talking about,' with officers describing him as being in an 'agitated' state. Miss Charlotte Newell, defending, said: 'What led this mild-mannered, gentle young man to behave this way may never be clear. 'His family are devastated by the havoc that has been wreaked. His actions do not square with the young man the family raised.' The court heard Nicholson attended London Metropolitan University, which recently awarded him a diploma and Miss Newell added: 'His true nature was not on display that evening. Sentence: Nicholson pleaded guilty to three counts of grievous bodily harm at Croydon Crown Court yesterday . 'His relationship with Miss Slim did not end well, but he did not bear her any ill will and even though she had been on his mind this exploded from nothing. There is no real grudge against the Slim’s.' Judge Stephen Waller heard Nicholas had abused alcohol and cannabis throughout his adult life and said: 'I think he poses a risk to any person with whom he has a grievance while under the influence of drink and drugs. 'There was carnage in the hallway of that suburban house,' he added. 'This was a premeditated sustained attack on three defenceless people in their own home. 'They will find it difficult, if ever, to recover from such a horrifying experience. 'There is nothing in your background that gives any clue as to why you acted in that dreadful fashion that night.' The probation service found there was a 'high likelihood' that Nicholson would re-offend and a restraining order was made to protect the Slim family once he is paroled. Judge Waller told Nicholson he would have to serve at least two-thirds of the sentence and would be subjected to an extended licence period of an additional five years.","Luke Nicholson, 29, received 16-year jail sentence for grievous bodily harm .

Details of the kind of service passengers . can expect when a publicly run key rail line returns to the private . sector are being laid out today by the Government. Labour and rail unions have been among those bitterly opposed to the refranchising of the East Coast line which has been run in the public sector for four years. The RMT union has said that the . prospectus being revealed today will see a return to 'third-class . travel' on the line which runs from London to Scotland. Labour and rail unions have been among those bitterly opposed to the refranchising of the East Coast line which has been run in the public sector for four . Ministers insist the so-called 'third class' involve an offer of an airline-style 'premium economy' service, between the present standard class and first class. The RMT and others have also pointed out that the East Coast has proved a real value-for-money line in that it has returned large amounts of money to the Treasury since National Express pulled out of the franchise in November 2009. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said David Cameron should cap rail fare rises instead of 'obsessing about East Coast' Labour has also expressed disappointment that, with the franchise programme on the railways put back and altered following the botched West Coast franchise bidding process, the Government has appeared to prioritise the East Coast refranchising - due in early 2015 - for political purposes. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said today: ‘David Cameron should tackle his Government's cost-of-living crisis and cap rail fare rises for struggling commuters, instead of obsessing about handing East Coast over to the private sector. ‘East Coast is working well and will have returned £800 million to the taxpayer by the end of this financial year. ‘This Government has learned nothing from the West Coast franchising fiasco, which saw more than £50 million of taxpayers' money wasted in compensation to train companies because of ministers' incompetence.' The RMT has said that it understands the East Coast contract would be awarded 'on lucrative, profiteering terms that will enable them to reduce the quality of service [and] introduce a new band of third-class travel'. Channel Tunnel high-speed train company Eurostar has said it wants to bid for the East Coast franchise in partnership with French company Keolis which already runs a number of UK domestic lines. RMT General Secretary Bob Crow said: ‘It is simply outrageous that the Government are firing the starting gun on the reprivatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service contributing a billion pounds back to the Government while the private operators are milking huge profits and soaking up vast taxpayer subsidies.’ He added: ’If the Government are allowed to get away with this, passengers can expect third class services, shoddy performance and higher fares while the private companies get a gold-plated, eleven year franchise that will enable them to launder hundreds of millions of pounds into the pockets of their shareholders. 'It stinks and it must be stopped and the campaign to prevent the reprivatisation will haunt this rotten Government right up to polling day.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: 'This is ill informed scaremongering from the RMT. By choosing to release inaccurate information, they are misleading the public. We have no intention of requiring a “third class” service, reducing performance levels, or in any way devaluing this vital railway. As the independent Brown Review concluded, franchising works for passengers and taxpayers alike.'","Government will propose new 'third class' service in bid to re-nationalise the East Coast mainline from London to Scotland .

It was through his work with Mr Henson that Mr Philpott landed the Jabba part, using his skills to work the left arm, head and slimy flicking tongue of the alien during key scenes. He said: 'It took a team of four of us to operate Jabba - he wasn't so much a costume as a wendy house you had to climb into. 'I was sitting down with my left arm in his, and my right swiveling his neck and tongue. 'As the left hand I got to eat frogs, hit people and smoke a hookah.'

'So we'd get George Lucas to address Jabba rather than us individually which did freak him out a bit at first.' But when the industry changed to include . advanced modern technology like CGI, Mr Philpott found that some of his . work started to dry up. Many projects that would in the past have been shot in the UK started to move to America, meaning that work was tight. Mr Philpott said: 'I never really wanted ti chase the work to America. I enjoyed it but it was just a phase in my life. 'In the mid 1990s I was scratching a living as a circus trainer, so I took a temporary job with the library just to eat. 'Then it got made permanent and i just drifted away from performing.' He added: 'Many people ask me why I started working here and all I can say is why not?

Double tragedy: Louise Ann Snape (left) died from the same heart condition that killed her four-year-old daughter Katie (right) A grieving mother died from the same rare genetic heart condition that killed her little girl, an inquest heard. Louise Ann Snape, 35, passed away at her home in Middleton, Greater Manchester, three years after daughter Katie, four, lost her life. An inquest at Rochdale Coroners Court heard that Ms Snape and Katie both died from dilated cardiomyopathy, a genetic illness which damages heart muscles and affects one in 5,000 people. Katie’s twin sister Lauren, now eight, who also suffers from the condition, discovered her mother’s body on March 29. Katie, . a pupil at Little Heaton Primary School, died in July 2010, four days . before her fifth birthday, while she was waiting for a second heart . transplant. Ms Snape, a former . care assistant, of Rhodes, only became aware she suffered from the . condition - which is sometimes known as sudden death syndrome - and had . passed it on to her daughters after the girls were born. She suffered from blood clots on her lungs and spent a short time in hospital while the girls were young. Her . sister, Sarah, told the inquest she struggled to cope after Katie’s . death, especially when her partner, the girls’ father, Simon Williams, . was sent to prison. Sarah, . of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, said: 'Losing Katie was absolutely devastating . for Louise. She usually managed, but sometimes she struggled. Sudden death syndrome: An inquest heard that Louise and Katie both died from dilated cardiomyopathy, a genetic illness which damages heart muscles and affects one in 5,000 people . 'I used to go down and help sometimes . and she had lots of friends for support. Katie’s death really affected . Louise. She became very depressed.' The . inquest heard that Ms Snape, whose mother died from cancer just three . days after she passed away, was taking prescribed anti-depressants. Sudden death syndrome is caused by a 'ventricular arrhythmia' - a disturbance in the heart's rhythm. It can strike at any age and can even affect those who are fit and athletic. Sometimes there are no warning signs, but in other cases victims can experience dizziness or fainting spells. Every year at least 600 young people die as a result of the condition. It’s different from a heart attack, where one of the arteries supplying the heart is blocked with a blood clot, starving the heart muscle of oxygen-rich blood. Sarah said she was not aware her sister was ill in the days before she died. She added: 'She probably would not want to worry me if she wasn’t feeling well because I was back and forth with hospital dealing with our mum.' A report from PC Stuart Lewis, who was called to the family home on the morning after Ms Snape's death, said that Louise had watched television with her daughter until 10pm the night before her death. Lauren awoke early to discover her mother lying on the floor and went to a next-door neighbour, who called the emergency services. Toxicology reports found that Ms Snape had no alcohol in her system and her medication had not contributed to her death. Recording a verdict of natural causes, deputy coroner Elaine Maloney, told Ms Snape: 'Your family has suffered a lot from this condition. 'I can only pass on my sincere condolences for what you have been through.'","Louise Ann Snape, 35, passed away three years after daughter Katie died .

The NHS has been accused of rationing vital treatments after refusing to help ‘undeserving’ patients unless they lose weight or quit smoking. It is denying patients hip and knee replacements, cataract surgery or even IVF unless they agree to make radical changes to their lifestyle. An investigation has revealed that one in four health trusts in England bars certain operations or procedures for smokers or those deemed too fat. Demands: Patients deemed to be 'undeserving', such as some who are overweight or those who smoke, are being denied NHS treatments unless they change their lifestyles . They include NHS Hertfordshire, which has banned certain patients from any operation requiring a general anaesthetic other than lifesaving surgery on their hearts, brains or to remove cancer. Instead they are being sent on weight management courses or to ‘stop smoking’ clinics and told to come back only when they lead healthier lives. MPs and senior doctors last night accused the NHS of ‘withholding treatment’ from anyone whose lifestyle it disapproves of. However, managers at Health Service trusts insisted that such restrictions are in people’s ‘best interests’. Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said peoples' diets and whether they chose to smoke are all 'lifestyle choices' Dr Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ‘It’s becoming the deserving and the undeserving. I think it’s discriminatory and I find it astonishing. The Government should determine what should be applied universally.’ Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘What people eat, drink or whether they smoke is a lifestyle choice. ‘It’s wrong if it is being management-led. What we can’t have is the state withdrawing treatment because it disapproves of the ways people live. 'They are still tax-paying citizens and they deserve services. ‘My view is that if this is done for clinical reasons then it should be a decision taken  by doctors.’ Freedom of Information requests obtained by Pulse, a magazine for GPs, from 91 trusts in England show that 25 have imposed some form of restriction since last April. In NHS Bedfordshire, anyone with a body mass index above 35 – deemed to be severely obese – is barred from having hip or knee surgery. This is equivalent to a 5ft 5in woman weighing 15 stone or a 6ft man weighing 18 and a half stone. Before they are allowed surgery they must lose 10 per cent of their body weight or reduce their BMI to below 35. NHS North Essex requires patients to lose 5 per cent of their body weight and ensure they keep it off for at least  six months. Vital: Hip and knee replacements, cataract surgery and even IVF are among the key NHS procedures being withheld from patients who are deemed as 'undeserving' A total of 11 NHS trusts barred smokers and the obese from hip and knee replacements, while nine denied them IVF. This includes the Peninsula Health Technology Commissioning Group, covering Cornwall, Devon, Torbay and Plymouth, which bars both men and women from undergoing IVF treatment unless they have been non-smokers for at least six months. Ben Troke, partner at Browne Jacobson LLP solicitors, warned that the measures could be regarded as discriminating against certain groups in society. Dr Clare Gerada argued that the NHS move was 'discriminatory' But those doctors and managers who have drawn up the restrictions insist they are medically justified. Smokers and the obese are more likely to develop breathing difficulties or suffer heart or kidney problems while under general anaesthetic. Hip and knee replacements also tend to be less successful in the obese while there is evidence they benefit less  from IVF. However, there are concerns that many trusts are imposing the restrictions only to  save money. Although the NHS’s budget has not been cut, it has been ordered to spend its money more efficiently to save £20billion over the next three years. This will then be ploughed back into care. Faced with such strict targets, many health trusts have resorted to restricting certain treatments and services. Dr Nicolas Small, Chair of Herts Valleys Clinical Commissioning Group, said:  ‘The measures we have introduced in Hertfordshire are for people who need routine surgery only. ‘They do not apply when people need urgent or emergency surgery such as to treat cancer. 'There will also be times when it will be appropriate to offer surgery to a patient without following these measures.’","NHS refuses 'undeserving' patients vital treatment in move branded 'discriminatory'

Mother-of-eleven Heather Frost faces having her £60,000-a-year benefits cut after receiving £2,000 to appear on TV and boast about her life. The 37-year-old, who has never worked and claims around £60,000 a year in benefits, is currently appearing in a documentary series on Channel 5 called On Benefits and Proud. But her local council said they would now . be investigating her huge hand-outs after reports she was given a substantial fee to appear on the show. Scroll down for video . Unemployed: Heather Frost, pictured with one of her nine daughters at their taxpayer-funded six-bedroom home, could lose her benefits after receiving £6,000 to appear in a documentary . She caused outrage earlier this year when a council offered to build her and her enormous family a £500,000 eco-home. The probe comes after Frost was questioned by police when she apparently admitted paying for stolen goods at her front door in last week’s programme. The TV station would not comment about the payment but Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'Life on welfare shouldn’t be an alternative to finding genuine work. 'Claimants have a duty to declare if their circumstances change as benefits are a safety net, not an alternative form of income. 'Taxpayers footing the bill will take a dim view of someone still claiming every penny they can while sitting on a handsome cheque for thousands.' Richard Horton, revenues and benefits group manager at Tewkesbury Borough Council in Gloucestershire said it was their duty to investigate. Unrepentant: The mother-of-eleven was also alleged to have paid for stolen goods during filming of the Channel 5 programme On Benefits and Proud . He refused to discuss Frost’s benefits but added: 'In all cases, if we believe there are grounds for an investigation then we are duty bound to carry one out.' Frost, who gets £900-per-week in benefits, is featuring on the documentary which looks at a number of families from across the country who are supported by the state. The first episode last Monday, focused on Frost and her quest to move into a £500,000 council-funded eco home. Frost said on the show: 'People don’t agree with the benefit system but the system is there for people who can’t go out and work. Home: Heather Frost with her enormous family of 11 children (nine daughters and two sons) who live entirely off state benefits . 'Yes it is my choice to have a large family but there is no law to say how many kids you can have.' Also featured on the series are a couple from Liverpool who have not worked for six years, and two single mothers in Camden whose rents are more than £1,200 a month each and are paid for by the state. They are all believed to have received a fee from Channel 5 so the camera crews could enter their crews and part of their contract requires them to declare this money. One couple, Vinnie Bienvenue and his new wife Julie, have also appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show in the past. Mrs Bienvenue, 34, has six children and Vinnie has three, but they are yet to have their own child. Frost was due to move into a specially built six-bedroomed home after she complained that her current house, in Churchdown, Glouscestershire, was unsafe. She currently lives with her children, aged from four to 22, in two terraced houses that have been knocked together. But she was refused the new taxpayer-funded home a few miles away just weeks later because the £500,000 property did not meet her needs. Relaxing: Heather Frost pictured with her neighbour in the garden of her Gloucestershire home during the Channel 5 documentary . The proposed house had three bathrooms, a large open-plan kitchen-diner and two lounges with French windows overlooking a spacious garden. The 1,850 sq ft detached property was designed with state-of-the-art technology to cut electricity bills and has now been given to a new family. The council will now make £2,000 worth of improvements to her two current homes. Claudia Cobban, housing manager at Severn Vale Housing, said: 'We are planning to carry out minimal changes to the Frost’s current home to make it more suitable for the family’s needs. 'The changes will improve the connection been the two properties, providing a more permanent solution for the family.' Frost first fell pregnant when she was 15 to a 23 year-old boyfriend who ended up in prison. Her children are Sophie, 22, Toby, 20, Angel, 17, Jay, 15, Chloe, 13, Paige, 12, Emily, ten, Bethany, nine, Ruby, eight, Daisy, six, and Tilly, who is four.

San Diego Chargers outside linebacker Dwight Freeney had millions of dollars stolen by Micheal Stern, from Miami, who pretended to be an investor interested in the star's Hollywood restaurant . A former property developer who stole $3million (£1.8million) from NFL player Dwight Freeney has been jailed for five years. Michael A Stern, 53, from Miami, used the money to pay for family vacations, jewellery, his children's private school tuition and legal bills from a bankruptcy case in Florida, according to court documents. Stern claimed to be a wealthy businessman interested in investing in a Hollywood restaurant that Freeney owned in order to gain his trust. The two were introduced in February 2010 through Stern's lover Eva Weinberg, who was also Freeney's business manager. Stern then used information given to him by Weinberg to take millions of dollars from Freeney's accounts over more than a year. Sensing that the FBI were about to arrest him, Freeney called somebody who turned out to be an informant and asked them to destroy a hard drive containing evidence in March 2012. Police arrested him at Miami International Airport later the same month. Stern pleaded guilty to fraud in January and was yesterday sentenced to five years in federal prison and ordered to pay Freeney $2.6million. Weinberg pleaded guilty in June to a related count of accessory after the fact. She is set to be sentenced in December. Freeney, a seven-time Pro Bowl pass rusher, is out for the season after having surgery. Freeney's business partner, Eva Weinberg, who was also Stern's lover, gave Stern information he used to defraud the NFL player .

Spain will suffer ‘reprisals’ if it continues to threaten the sovereignty of Gibraltar, William Hague warned yesterday. The Foreign Secretary made no attempt to conceal his anger with Madrid as he updated MPs on a summer campaign of harassment by Spain against Gibraltar. ‘Gibraltar is British and wants to stay British and for us that is the end of the matter,’ he said. ‘We will never negotiate over sovereignty over the people of Gibraltar’s heads, as the last Labour government did.’ Go: DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr (left) called on the government to get tough with Spain's ambassador to the UK Federico Trillo, who  has already been summoned to the Foreign Office over delays at the Gibraltar border . Queues: There have been long delays at the Spain-Gibraltar border this summer after Spain imposed draconian checks on traffic . Veteran Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman . urged Mr Hague to make it clear to Spain that the harassment ‘will not . be tolerated and that, if need be, there will be reprisals’. Mr Hague replied: ‘I absolutely will.’ But . DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr urged him to go further and order Federico Trillo . to leave the capital if the ‘hostility’ towards Gibraltar is not . halted. Tensions over the Rock escalated this summer after Spain threatened to impose a £43 fee could be on anyone entering or leaving the British territory. Madrid also imposed strict checks on traffic at the border with Gibraltar in protest at the creation of an artificial reef. The Spanish say the 74 concrete blocks on the seabed disrupt an area used by its fishing boats, while the Gibraltarians say it was a necessary environmental measure. In early August Mr Trillo was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down over ‘disproportionate’ border checks. But a month later there people trying to enter Gibraltar are still experiencing problems. Stance: Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted that the government¿s ¿position on sovereignty is clear¿ . Speaking in the Commons, Mr Paisley Jr urged Mr Hague to take a tough line with the Spanish ambassador. He said: ‘In seven days time, the people of Gibraltar will celebrate their national day and I hope they will be able to celebrate it in a spirit of peace and stability. ‘Can I make it abundantly clear to the Spanish that if they continue their hostility to the people of Gibraltar, that you (Mr Hague) will tell the ambassador here in London to pack his sombrero, straw donkey and sangria and go?’ Mr Hague insisted that the government’s ‘position on sovereignty is clear’, adding: ‘There have been occasions in recent weeks when we have summoned the Spanish ambassador, but I think if you'll forgive me we will use slightly more diplomatic language than you are recommending.’ But he added that as Gibraltarians want to remain British that is the end of the matter, although the UK remains in favour of talks to settle the latest dispute with Spain. During foreign office questions Mr Hague was challenged in the Commons by Conservative MP Jake Berry to affirm that he will ‘never give an inch’ on British sovereignty in Gibraltar. Mr Hague replied: ‘We are in favour of talks with Spain. Gibraltar is British and wants to stay British and for us that is the end of the matter and we will never negotiate over sovereignty over the people of Gibraltar's heads as the last Labour government did. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg last night used a phone call with his Spanish counterpart to push for an end to the border checks. He made clear to Soraya Saenz de Santamaria that the crisis could not continue and urged Madrid to take part in urgent talks. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has committed to sending a fact-finding mission to the Spain-Gibraltar border in the coming weeks. David Cameron is still considering taking Spain to the European courts for breaking the law on free movement within the EU.","DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr calls on the government to threaten Spain .

Pte Kershaw, a Warrior driver, was one of six to die when their armoured car was ripped apart by a Taliban bomb 25 miles north of Lashkar Gar in Helmand province on March 6. Like all front-line service men and women, he had been encouraged to write a final letter home to his family in case he was killed. Pte Kershaw wrote to his family: 'This is to inform you of the unfortunate death of, well, me. I would like to explain that even though I don’t know how I died I am sure it was from some heroic act.

Major Malcolm Birkett, Commanding Officer of the rear area group of the third Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, said: 'It is a sad occasion. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to Brian who lost his mother yesterday. 'He is not only having to bury his son, but has lost his mother as well. 'Chris’s grandfather was in the Black Watch and told him what it took to be an infantry soldier.

She had been ill for some time and was not expected to attend the funeral because she was unwell.' During the service, tributes were paid by Chris’s sister, Sarah-Louise Kershaw, and his mother, Monica. Sarah-Louise said: 'Chris always was and always will be a true hero.

The BBC has been accused of a cover-up after spending almost £350,000 on a legal battle to suppress an internal report about bias in its Middle East coverage. A seven-year campaign to gain access to the 2004 document, which examined the corporation’s coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ended in defeat  yesterday after the Supreme Court ruled it could remain secret. Lawyer Steven Sugar, who passed away last year, made a Freedom of Information request in 2005 for disclosure of the 20,000-word Balen Report. Report: The case centres around an investigation into claims of bias in BBC coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The BBC has won the right not to publish the report (file picture) But the corporation argued it was exempt from revealing information it held for the purposes of ‘journalism, art or literature’. After years of courtroom battles and Mr Sugar’s death, his widow Fiona  Paveley continued on his behalf. Her lawyer, Michael Levey, said  the . family were ‘considering their options’ after the Supreme Court . dismissed the latest appeal after ruling the report was ‘outside the . scope’ of the FoI Act. By September 2010, the BBC had spent . £270,000 on the case, but senior insiders admitted this had now . increased to as much as £350,000. Legal battle: The BBC has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in the case in a bid to suppress the report . Probe: BBC veteran Jeremy Bowen who is the Middle East Editor . The broadcaster’s reluctance to reveal . the details of the dossier – which was compiled by Malcolm Balen, a . senior journalist and editorial adviser at the BBC – has led to . speculation that it  was highly critical. Lord Janner of Braunstone, chairman of the Britain Israel Parliamentary Group, said last night: ‘What have they got to hide?’ Tory MP Mike Freer, vice-chairman of . the All Party Parliamentary Group Against Anti-Semitism, added: ‘This is . the worst of all outcomes. ‘It fuels suspicion they have got  something to hide.’ A spokesman for the BBC insisted it . did not have anything to hide about its Middle East coverage but had . pursued the case to defend its right to protect information about its . journalism. He added: ‘We welcome the Supreme . Court’s judgment, which will ensure that the BBC is afforded the space . to conduct its journalistic activities freely. ‘Independent journalism requires . honest and open internal debate free from external pressures. This . ruling enables us to continue to do that.’ Revelation: Barbara Plett said she cried when Yasser Arafat was close to death in 2004 . The BBC has faced claims that its reporting of the Arab-Israeli conflict has been skewed towards the Palestinian cause. Critics cite the revelation from Middle East correspondent Barbara Plett . (pictured) that she cried when Yasser Arafat was close to death in 2004. And a confidential report put together by the Corporation lifts the lid on whether they really had a pro-Palestinian bias. However, the 20,000-word document compiled by veteran journalist Malcolm Balen will now be kept secret after the Supreme Court ruling. Lawyer Steven Sugar requested to see the 2004 document under freedom of information laws. It examines hundreds of hours of BBC radio and television broadcasts. However, the BBC turned down the request and - after seven years - the highest court in the land has finally ruled that it will remain secret. The decision will disappoint the Jewish community which would have wanted . to know whether the document had found any evidence of . anti-Israeli bias in news programming. The BBC said that, under the Freedom of Information Act, it is exempt . from disclosing information held for the purposes of 'journalism, art or . literature'. However, Mr Sugar, who represented himself in court, said the Balen Report should be published as part of a debate about alleged anti-Israeli bias.

Eight hundred jobs at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant were saved yesterday after an 11th-hour climbdown by Unite. Owner Ineos had announced it was going to close the operation after the union rejected a survival plan – including a pay freeze and watered down pensions. But staff were told of the reprieve after Unite was forced into a humiliating change of heart. The union has accepted a three-year pay freeze and committed not to strike during that period. It also agreed to scrap gold-plated ‘final salary’ pension schemes for staff, who earn an average salary of £55,000. Delight: Worker Eddie Heaney celebrated after the announcement by owners Ineos to keep the Grangemouth petrochemical site open . Decision: The owners of the plant, Ineos, said the site had to be shut down because it is losing £10m a month . The deal means Ineos – majority owned by reclusive billionaire Jim Ratcliffe – will invest £300million in the Falkirk plant in Scotland. He said: ‘This is a victory for common sense. The Unite union advised employees to reject change and vote for closure. Thank goodness people finally came to their senses. Grangemouth now has a great future.’ Prime Minister David Cameron added: ‘On a day when the economy is picking up it’s excellent news that a really important petrochemical plant will stay open, saving thousands of jobs not just at that plant but in the supply chain, and also seeing the refinery reopen, it’s good news. 'I think sense has been seen which is that, when you have challenges and costs, you need reform.’ Anger: Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman Calum Maclean (R) and Gordon Grant, Ineos site manager blamed the Unite union for the crisis, but insisted commonsense had prevailed . Saved: 800 jobs at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, would have been lost if the closure had gone ahead . Unite initially advised staff to reject the company’s cost-cutting plans, winning support from 65 per cent of its members. But the union’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, said it had now decided they had to ‘embrace’ the survival plan, ‘warts and all’, to prevent the loss of 800 jobs. It emerged last night that BP, which sold the Grangemouth plant to Ineos in 2006, was also instrumental in helping to secure its survival – agreeing new financial terms to help stem losses of £10million a month. Cheers: Workers who thought their jobs had been axed just two days ago were quick to share the news that the decision had been reversed . Changes: Employees at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant will still face changes to their pay and pensions as part of the cost-cutting deal to save the site . Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: ‘This is a very positive result. We can now look forward to a future of growth at Grangemouth.’ The dispute, which was also said to threaten the adjacent oil refinery,  began over Ineos’s treatment of Stephen Deans, the union shop steward and local Labour Party chairman who was under investigation over allegations linked to the Falkirk vote-rigging affair. He was cleared of wrongdoing but Ineos conducted its own probe against a backdrop of proposed  new working practices – triggering industrial action. Grangemouth (UK) chairman Calum MacLean said: ‘Unite risked 800 jobs and one of the UK’s largest manufacturing facilities. Today’s U-turn means Grangemouth now has an excellent future.’ Desperate: Staff stage a protest at Grangemouth in a last ditch attempt to save the refinery .","Ineos revealed plans to shut the petrochemicals division of the plant .

Growth: Men are, on average, four inches taller than they were around the time of the start of the First World War . Men are four inches taller than they were 100 years ago, according to a new study. Researchers found the average height of European men has grown by 11 centimetres in just over a century. And, contrary to expectations, the study also found that average height actually accelerated in the period spanning the two World Wars and the Great Depression. Timothy Hatton, Professor of Economics at the University of Essex, examined and analysed figures for the average height - at the age of around 21 - of men from the 1870’s to 1980 in 15 European countries. The statistics were drawn from a variety of sources. For the most recent decades the data was mainly taken from height-by-age in surveys. Figures for the earlier years were based on data for the heights of military conscripts and recruits. The figures are for men only as the historical evidence for women’s heights is severely limited. Professor Hatton said: 'Increases in human stature are a key indicator of improvements in the average health of populations. 'The evidence suggests that the improving disease environment, as reflected in the fall in infant mortality, is the single most important factor driving the increase in height. 'The link between infant mortality and height has already been demonstrated by a number of studies.' Infant mortality rates fell from an average of 178 per 1,000 in the period from 1871 to 1875 to 120 per 1,000 in 1911 to 1915. They then plummeted to 41 in 1951 to 1955 and just 14 from 1976 to 1980. Prof Hatton said that in northern and . middle European countries - including Britain and Ireland, the . Scandinavian countries, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, and Germany - . there was a 'distinct quickening' in the pace of advance in the period . spanning the two World Wars and the Great Depression. Smaller family sizes, better nutrition and improved livjng conditions are behind the spike in height. File picture . He added: 'This is striking because the period largely pre-dates the wide implementation of major breakthroughs in modern medicine and national health services. 'One possible reason, alongside the crucial decline in infant mortality, for the rapid growth of average male height in this period was that there was a strong downward trend in fertility at the time, and smaller family sizes have already been linked with increasing height.' He said other factors in the increase in average male height include an increased income per capita; more sanitary housing and living conditions; better general education about health and nutrition which led to better care for children and young people within the home; and better social services and health systems. The findings were published in the journal Oxford Economic Papers.","European men have grown thanks to healthier diets and better housing .

Council spokesman said the authority was looking into the details of what had happened. Also spotted leaving the exclusive club on Friday night were actress Joan Collins, 80, her husband Percy Gibson, 68, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, 65 and his wife Madeleine Gurdon, 50. It comes after an incident last Wednesday that saw Hillary Clinton pay a £40 fine on a credit card, after she was given a parking ticket on October 11 by a warden in Mayfair. Photographs showed the 65-year-old former US secretary of state’s security staff getting into an argument with the warden after he issued her silver Mercedes with a ticket. The Westminster warden put an £80 penalty notice on her car while she was attending an event at Chatham House - but the fine was halved because she paid within 14 days. Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, were seen leaving LouLou’s shortly after each other in July. The club is also known to be a favourite venue of Sarah’s daughter Princess Beatrice. The Duchess fuelled speculation last month that she and Andrew might remarry, admitting: 'He is still my handsome prince.' The 53-year-old, whose 10-year marriage to the Prince, with whom she has two daughters, ended in divorce in 1996, refused to deny rumours that the pair might get back together. Instead she said: 'He'll always be my handsome prince. It's really lovely that we are still a family and the story has a happy ending all the time.'

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 06:54 EST, 10 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 10 June 2013 . The man behind one of the most significant leaks in U.S. history has revealed himself as a high school drop-out who turned against his government when he realized it was 'doing far more harm than good'. As Edward Snowden steps from the shadows to explain his reasons for leaking information from the National Security Agency, questions are emerging over how the failed student rose up the ranks to become gatekeeper of the government's biggest secrets. Snowden, 29, spoke to The Guardian from a hotel room in Hong Kong where he is on the run after leaking sensitive documents on how the NSA has gleaned personal data from internet companies. He had access to the NSA's top secrets after a steep rise . to work for government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, which paid him . $200,000 a year to work on the the agency's computer systems. The whistleblower: Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency, is pictured in Hong Kong after identifying himself as the man who leaked the agency's secrets . While there, the NSA let him see 'everything', he said - a baffling position considering his limited credentials. Snowden grew up in in Elizabeth City, . North Carolina, before later moving to Maryland, near the headquarters . of the National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade. Public records show his mother is a government employee - a deputy clerk for the U.S. District Court in Maryland - the Washington Post reported. He took just a few 'computer' classes at a community college in a bid to get his high-school equivalency degree, yet he failed to complete them. Despite no qualifications, The Guardian, which interviewed him at a secret location, called him 'a master on computers' and 'happiest when talking about the technical side of surveillance'. As a teenager he dreamed of defending . the American Way as a soldier in the U.S. Army and began a training . program to join the Special Forces in 2003. He told The Guardian he wanted to . fight in the Iraq war because he felt he had an obligation as a human . being to help free people from oppression - the same reason he is giving . to justify his leaks. Far from home: The home in Waipahu, Hawaii, where Snowden lived with his girlfriend until recently . Edward Snowden has fled to Hong Kong, which is a gamble, but the country's free speech laws mean he does have a slim chance of avoiding being swept back to America if the government demand he returns. Hong Kong signed an extradition treaty with the United States in 1997, just before Britain handed it back to China. In it both agreed to send fugitives back and forth in the majority of cases, but there were also political exemptions negotiated at the time. Hong Kong has the 'right of refusal when surrender implicates the ""defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy'' of the People's Republic of China'. China itself has no extradition treaty with America at all. Hong Kong officials also have the right to say no to extradition if they believe that the attempt is 'politically motivated'. This means that they will protect free speech if a person is being arrested just for their political opinions. The United States may have already approached Interpol or its consulate in Hong Kong to start proceedings. They will use the Espionage Act to gain warrants for his arrest. Hong Kong's authorities can hold Snowden for 60 days, following a U.S. request that includes probable cause, while Washington prepares a formal extradition request. 'I think it is really tragic that an American has to move to a place that has a reputation for less freedom,' he told The Guardian. But he was stunned when he began his training. 'Most of the people training us seemed pumped up about killing Arabs, not helping anyone,' he said. After he broke both his legs in a training accident, he was discharged. The Guardian added that Snowden had tried to join the elite special forces but had been unsuccessful. Records show he enlisted in the army reserve as a special forces recruit in May 2004 and was discharged that September. An army spokesman told the Guardian that he did not complete any training or receive any awards. He got his first NSA job working as a . security guard at one of the agency's facilities at the University of . Maryland before moving to the CIA to work on IT security. There, he rose . quickly, making a bizarrely large leap to having access to more and more top-secret documents as he climbed the ranks. On its hiring site, the NSA says each role requires a different application process. But it says that applicants 'can expect their hiring process to include medical screening, a polygraph interview, drug test, and an extensive background investigation'. It adds that the background check helps determine the person's 'honesty, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, and unquestioned loyalty to the United States' and requires interviews with family and colleagues. It is unknown which checks Snowden underwent before his job as a security guard, and whether these checks were repeated as he rose through the ranks. The NSA does give hiring preference to former military, according to its website. In 2007, the CIA . stationed him with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was . responsible for maintaining computer network security and privy to more . secrets than ever before. Despite his lackluster resume, he was not only privy to the agency's surveillance systems, he also had the ability to use them, he told the Guardian in a video interview. 'I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the . authorities [sic] to wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a . federal judge to even the president if I had a personal email,' he said. After soaring up the ranks at . the NSA and then as a contractor, he said there came a moment when he . realized his government was 'doing more harm than good'. Surveillance: Policemen stand outside the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong; Snowden fled to the country after releasing information about the NSA to The Guardian newspaper but his location is unknown . 'Much . of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government . functions and what its impact is in the world,' he said. He told The Guardian of one incident . where CIA operatives got a Swiss banker drunk in an effort to recruit . him as an informant to obtain secret banking information. He said they encouraged him to drive . home intoxicated and when he was arrested for DUI, the undercover agents . offered to help, managing to recruit the banker on the back of the . favour. Snowden said this and other things he . witnessed in Geneva disillusioned him about how his government worked . and how this in turn impacted the world. 'I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good,' he said. He said he was disappointed President . Obama advanced the policies he was hoping the newly elected President . was stamp out and that 'hardened' him. Explaining why he decided to leave . the U.S., he said: 'I don't want to live in a society that does these . sort of things... I do not want to live in a world where everything I do . and say is recorded.' On the run: Visitors walk into The Mira Hotel, Snowden was reported to have checked out of on Monday . In hiding: Snowden is in Hong Kong, pictured, and said he does not expect ever to return home . Snowden was previously a technical officer for the CIA and worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) as an employee of Dell, a private contractor, before being hired by Booz Allen as an infrastructure analyst for the NSA in Hawaii. He said he was also stationed in Japan at one point. He worked as an infrastructure analyst for Booz Allen before telling his employers he needed to take a break for treatment for epilepsy. He told his girlfriend he needed to travel for work. In a statement, the company confirmed Snowden had been an employee for less than three months and had been assigned to a team in Hawaii. 'News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,' it said. Snowden said he was content to sever his 'very comfortable life', which included a six-figure salary, a girlfriend, a home in Hawaii and his family, to shine a light on the NSA's widening surveillance net. And while his decision to reveal his identity may seem strange considering the potential ramifications, he said: 'I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong.'","Edward Snowden, 29, leaked details of PRISM, a National Security Agency program he says harvests personal data from internet .

Matthew Charles Supran, 44, who is 6ft 3in tall and weighs 220lbs, is accused of child abuse after allegedly attacking 14-year-old ice hockey player . It is a well known fact that parents watching their children play sports can often become too involved in the game. But one father is accused of taking things to a new extreme after allegedly attacking a 14-year-old who elbowed his son in the face during a game of ice hockey. Matthew Charles Supran, 44, who is 6ft 3in tall and weighs 230lb, allegedly ran onto the rink and punched the boy in the face before slamming his head into wooden boards. The incident happened at around 3pm during a game on Sunday in Lake Worth, Florida, when Supran's son was elbowed in the face by an opposing player and fell over. The referee deemed the blow to be non-malicious and sent the offending player to the sin bin for five minutes. However, seemingly unhappy with the call, witnesses say Supran, from Delray Beach, then decided to take matters into his own hands and ran onto the rink. According to the police report Supran fell onto the victim after hitting him, and the referee and coach had to 'pull the defendant off of the player'. The parents of the unnamed player said Supran 'would know their son is a juvenile' from other hockey games they have attended. Supran, who has no prior arrests, was detained at his office on Wednesday morning before being released on a $3,000 (£1,850) bail. Fist fights are between ice hockey players, such as this one between the New York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres, are a popular and common occurrence . Unfortunately for fans of schoolboy ice hockey, the police report did not include information on the outcome of the game. Ice hockey is known for its extreme violence, with players often slamming each other into side walls while travelling at very high speeds. Competitors wear full padding and protective helmet to shield against the vicious blows. It is also common for players to engage in fist fights on the field, with several enforcers put on a team in order to intimidate opponents. While many fights are spontaneous and result from harsh tackles or perceived unfair play, some are planned. While not an official part of the game, fighting is tolerated and officials who won't usually dismiss a player for fighting, though they will impose penalties.","Matthew Charles Supran, 44, accused of child abuse .

Camilla held a private meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, who has been campaigning on payday loan firms. The Duchess of Cornwall met with Most Reverend Justin Welby at Clarence House, London, to discuss payday loan firms . The Duchess is a supporter of the idea of local credit unions, non-profit organisations that lend out members’ savings and encourage customers only to borrow amounts they can repay. The Archbishop, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, sees these institutions as the way to challenge the stranglehold of companies such as Wonga by offering a more ethical and less punishing alternative for people desperate for a loan. He was invited to Camilla’s London residence, Clarence House, on Friday for a meeting about his campaign against companies that charge exorbitant rates of interest on their loans. The Archbishop of Canterbury has been campaigning against payday loan companies such as Wonga . A spokesman for the Duchess said: ‘We are not in a position to confirm what was discussed in a private conservation between the Duchess and the Archbishop of Canterbury.’ Camilla, 66, joined the London Mutual Credit Union, in Peckham, London, in May. She said at the time that she wanted ‘to highlight the practical help that credit unions offer their communities in these difficult times’.","Duchess and Archbishop of Canterbury held private meeting at Clarence House .

A policeman's father executed a murder plan which he called 'The 12 days of Christmas' in which he battered to death a millionairess and buried her body down a garden well. Serial liar Christopher Symons killed wealthy Patricia Goodband before hiding her body in the 12ft deep shaft in a bid to inherit her fortune. A jury today convicted the 63-year-old of murder and also found his 73-year-old lover guilty of perverting the course of justice. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Christopher Symons (left) has been found guilty of the murder of Patricia Goodband (right) which he tried to cover up with a day-by-day plan called the 'The 12 days of Christmas' The court had earlier been shown Symons's murder jottings which he called 'The 12 days Xmas' in which he planned a day-by-day list of tasks to try to cover up Patricia Goodband’s murder. The incriminating list was found in his car by detectives searching for clues about her death. Ironically, Symons’s own son works as a detective in the same police force. Symons mapped out in detail his plan to get away with murder as he enlisted his elderly lover and a grave digger friend to help him cover his tracks. Among the web of lies he created included a claim that he had a quadraplegic son and that his granddaughter had undergone heart surgery. But his plot unravelled when police found the scrap of paper in his Toyota Hilux outlining his cover story.

Police have said that January 3, 2013, was the date Mrs Goodband was due to start back at her cleaning job. In 2008, she created a will in which she left two properties worth an estimated £800,000 and her savings totalling £230,000 to her killer. Mrs Goodband, who ran a haulage business with Symons from her home, was last seen alive three days before Christmas, on December 22. She was reported missing by her concerned daughter on January 9. Symons told officers investigating her disappearance that Mrs Goodband had told him she was heading to the North over the festive period. As part of his plan to throw detectives off the scent, Symons sent himself a series of text messages from Patricia’s phone to mislead officers - and used two others to back up his deceit. One of his two mistresses, Jennifer Creasey, admitted penning a fake Christmas card from ‘Sue’ to ‘Pat’ indicating that Mrs Goodband was due to arrive in Stockton-on-Tees on December 22, last year. She also lied to police in her witness statement. Grave digger Robert Taft initially backed up the cover story claiming falsely that he had dropped the missing woman off at Milton Keynes railway station but later crumbled and admitted he had lied.

Symons, of Aylesbury, was found guilty on a single charge of murder by the jury after just over four hours deliberation.

Two bus spotters claim their hobby is being ruined by abusive drivers making rude hand gestures. Harry Blakeway and Martin Anderson, who have taken 250,000 photographs of buses around Britain, say they get called 'bus perverts'. Some aggressive drivers around the country who do not appreciate the attention have made obscene signals, while others shouted at them, and another has even threatened to smash their £300 cameras, the pair claim. They also take issue with other drivers who cover their face to get out of the photo, which the spotters blast as 'dangerous'. But one company chief executive defended his . drivers, saying the photographers won’t take notice of polite requests . not to take pictures. Angry: Drivers are deliberately ruining their photos, the pair claim, by covering their faces or gesturing . 'Bus perverts': Harry Blakeway, 19 (left), with former driver and fellow spotter Martin Anderson, 26, at Telford Bus Station. They claim they have been abused for pursuing their childhood hobby . Harry, 19, from Ludlow, Shropshire, said: 'I’ve liked buses all my life and go out every single day, except Sundays, taking photos of them. 'I meet up with other people and we travel all over the country - often by bus - looking at different ones. 'I’ve got around 16,000 photos on my computer and it keeps me busy. 'We’re doing nothing wrong but some of the bus drivers try to stop us and get very angry at what we’re doing. 'We’re careful not to get in their way but we get abuse from some of them, and they swear and make all sorts of hand signs. 'Others cover their faces with papers while they’re driving, which is dangerous.' Rude: A gesturing driver captured by Mr Blakeway on September 28 in a GHA bus on Chester High Street . Distance: The avid photographers say they are careful not to obstruct the buses . Mr Blakeway, who doesn’t work, added: 'Probably the worst bus station is Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent. 'Most of the bus drivers there don’t like what we’re doing and we always get two fingers from them there. 'But we’re always careful to stand in the right place, on the pavement, and not to get in their way.' Former bus driver and fellow spotter Mr Anderson, 26, from Telford, who claims to have photographed more than 200,000 buses in 11 years, says the problem is nationwide. Angry: Drivers are deliberately ruining their photos, the pair claim, by covering their faces or gesturing . 'Abuse': Drivers have called the pair of bus spotters 'bus perverts' and made rude gestures to block their photos . He said: 'They complain that we’re invading their privacy but we’re not interested in them - it’s their buses we are photographing. 'The buses are part of the public and in the public eye and we are entitled to photograph them.' Mr Blakeway claims the worst offenders are drivers from the Arriva bus company. He complained to their head office a couple of months ago and emailed a selection of his abusive drivers in action. He said: 'I’ve reported all this to Arriva but they said there’s nothing they can do about it.' Both enthusiasts are determined not to let the conflict interfere with their childhood fascination. Mr Blakeway has been interested in buses since he was a child. His all-time favourites are the old Dennis Dart, followed by the modern Mercedes Setra. Privacy: 'They complain that we're invading their privacy but we're not interested in them - it's their buses we are photographing. The buses are in the public eye, we are entitled to,' Mr Blakeway said . His hobby has seen him make a day trip as far as Paisley in Scotland - by train - and he added: 'I’m not going to let these drivers stop me. 'They seem to think what I’m doing is sad and they hate having their photos taken, but I will carry on. 'I enjoy taking photos of buses so I can look at them in years to come and remember what they were like when I was younger.' Mr Anderson has been obsessed with buses since the age of two when his grandad drove them and gave him a lift. One of the photos shows a bus driver giving a V-sign in Chester on October 12 this year. The firm is owned by Wrexham-based GHA Coaches and chief executive Stuart Hyslop made no apology for the abusive gesture. Undeterred: 'I'm not going to let these drivers stop me. They seem to think what I'm doing is sad' Enthusiast: Harry Blakeway, 19, has taken around 16,000 photos of buses around Britain since he was a child . He said: 'Some of the drivers object to having their photographs taken and these people have been asked not to take them without obtaining their permission. 'If they want to take photographs when our buses are empty, that’s no problem. 'We’ve tried politely to ask them not to take photogaphs and if they ignore them I can’t be responsible for what the drivers do. 'The drivers are making obscene gestures because these people won’t take any notice of politeness.' Another photograph shows a driver for Wrexham-based Pat’s Coaches making a V-sign gesture in the town in November 2011. Company spokesman Mark Davies said: 'Unfortunately we can not identify the driver from the picture but all staff have been told that we do not accept this kind of behaviour from our staff.' A spokesman for Arriva told MailOnline: 'We expect our drivers to act in a responsible and courteous manor at all times.

Class A drugs are being delivered to homes across the UK by Royal Mail to customers who have bought them online like they were using Amazon or eBay, it has been revealed. Ecstasy, heroin, cannabis and cocaine are all on offer on the website Silk Road, and users say it is ‘easier and safer’ than buying drugs from dealers on street corners. UK shoppers can choose their illegal drugs with the click of a mouse and then wait for a neatly packaged parcel, with drugs disguised inside, to fall through their letter box. Illegal: Silk Road - a website known as the eBay for drugs - allows people to buy drugs like this block cannabis online and have it sent to them by Royal Mail . Scheme: The website is set up like an online store, allowing customers to find the drugs they want at the best price . Silk Road is an illegal replica online marketplace like eBay, with buyers and sellers, dispute and resolution services and feedback ratings. The website is accessed via a programme called Tor which enables all members to remain anonymous online and uses an 'onion' system to make sure their IP address is always hidden from police. An investigation by an online computer . security professor in America earlier this year estimated that Silk Road . boasts an annual sales figure of £14million. One clubber from Brighton, Sussex said: ‘There’s a group of us in Brighton who always order stuff online, it’s safer than going out to some dodgy car park somewhere. ‘It’s just so much easier and I know the quality of the stuff I order isn’t going to be compromised. ‘If I am ordering one or two things in a package like this then it won’t get picked up by the postal guys. ‘I reckon if I started ordering loads of stuff though in massive quantities it would probably mean trouble.’ Drugs are bought with ‘Bitcoins’, an untraceable digital currency. Dangerous: This cannabis was being sold but users say it is easier and safer than buying off a street dealer . Brazen: This cocaine was also for sale on Silk Road which is using complicated software to allow people to buy and sell anonymously . Amphetamine: This seller has piles of speed for sale, which is being sent by Royal Mail and landing on the nation's doorsteps . Killer: Drugs like this Crystal Meth displayed on Silk Road is being sent all over the world by dealers . A 30-year-old DJ from Hove, Sussex who did not want to be named said: ‘I was shocked at how easy it was at first. ‘I was used to having to call friends of friends to try and sort stuff out but now I just go online and wait. ‘There’s quite a decent community on there with some intelligent people, it’s not full of druggies like some people would think. ‘Why would I want to try and score from some dodgy dealer in a nightclub when I can just get it delivered to my doorstep? It’s a no-brainer.’ System: Users buy a currency called Bitcoins which are totally untraceable and can then purchase LSD tabs like these and then leave a review for the seller like on eBay or Amazon . Sussex Police said they were completely unaware of the practise and had ‘no intelligence’ on dealers using encrypted websites to supply illegal drugs by post. A spokeswoman said: ‘Sussex police welcomes any intelligence with regard to the supply of illicit drugs, which are a constant threat to our community, it’s a timely reminder that any drugs whether bought in person on the street or internet will come from dubious origin.’ The Royal Mail said they never knowingly allowed illegal substances to be delivered by post, but refused to disclose the steps taken to prevent postal dealing.

A baby boy found abandoned in Holland earlier this year has the same mother as a baby girl found in Germany in 2011, DNA tests have revealed. The boy was found lying in grass wrapped in a white blanket in the city of Roermond some 110 miles south of Amsterdam, on June 18 this year. Now DNA checks have revealed he has the same mother as a baby girl abandoned 62 miles away in Huerth, near the German city of Cologne in October 2011. Abandoned: A baby boy (left) found in June this year in the southern Dutch city of Roermond,  has the same mother as a baby girl (right) found 60 miles away in Germany in October 2011, DNA tests have revealed . It is not yet clear whether they share the same father. Dutch authorities, working with their German counterparts, have launched a hunt to track down the parents, but as yet do not know the identities. The baby girl, who appeared to have parents of European origin, was only about two days old when she was thrust into the arms of a man recycling garbage, said Cologne prosecutors' office spokesman Daniel Vollmert. At the side of a road, a man was unloading recycling into containers when another man approached him and said in broken German, 'Here, I found this', Mr Vollmert said. He handed him the little baby girl, swaddled in a towel and blanket and then fled. Police were called, but they could never identify the man who abandoned the baby. The boy has the same mother as a baby girl abandoned 62 miles away in Huerth, near the German city of Cologne in October 2011 . Both children are healthy and being cared for by foster families in the Netherlands and Germany, said Eugene Baak, a spokesman for the Dutch prosecutors who hope the new information will lead to tips from the public that could help authorities trace the children's biological parents. It is not yet clear whether the siblings will, at some stage, be reunited. 'The possibility is being investigated,' Mr Baak said. The girl's DNA was tested after she was abandoned and entered into a databank. That didn't help identify the mother, but Dutch authorities found that it matched the baby boy they found. Mr Vollmert said it is still not even known whether the baby was voluntarily given up by the mother or taken away from her.","The boy was found in the city of Roermond south of Amsterdam, on June 18 .

Father-of-three Victor Hayles was found hanging from the conservatory door by his wife Susan . A practical joker accidentally hanged himself on a conservatory door when he tried to play a prank on his wife. Father-of-three Victor Hayles' last joke went 'horribly wrong' when he was found dead by his wife Susan in August. After arriving home from a party shortly after midnight on the night he died, Mr Hayles took his dog for a walk. When his wife went looking for him she made the grim discovery, finding her husband's body hanging from the conservatory door, his feet still touching the ground. Portsmouth coroner David Horsley examining the circumstances of Mr Hayles' death, today recorded a verdict of accidental death and said the 57-year-old had been playing out a bizarre prank. He said: 'I think it’s a prank that went horribly wrong and therefore I have to conclude it’s an accidental death.' Mrs Hayles, who was married to her electrician husband for 18 years, said: 'We were relieved when the coroner ruled Victor’s death was an accident. 'We always knew he wouldn’t have committed suicide because he wasn’t very good at tolerating pain. 'It was just a practical joke that went horribly wrong. 'He was always pulling pranks and would pretend to electrocute himself when using the drill so I think this was just another of them. 'Victor knew I would . go and check on him and turn off the lights so I think he was waiting, . ready to scare me with his joke. 'Although we are glad he hadn’t meant to kill himself, it’s still sad because we have lost him.' A coroner ruled Mr Hayles' death was accidental, after his practical joke had gone 'horribly wrong'. His daughter, Daisy, said: 'Everyone loved him and he had lots of friends through his passion for motorbikes' The inquest, held at Portsmouth Guildhall, heard Mr Hayles, who lived in the city, had been out drinking on the night of his death. However, the level of alcohol in his system was only 1.7 times the legal driving limit. The father-of three had made plans for the weekend of his death and was looking forward to his birthday and wedding anniversary, which were less than a week away. His daughter, Daisy, 31, said: 'He lived his life like a bachelor and he loved it. 'He would go on holiday with his friends and go out drinking but was always eager to return home to his wife. 'Everyone loved him and he had lots of friends through his passion for motorbikes.'

A top secret 20ft long panorama of the Normandy coastline taken during daring spy missions just months before D-Day has emerged for sale almost 70 years later. The photos were snapped by highly-skilled Spitfire pilots who recorded the landscape as seen from the sea ahead of the pivotal beach invasion. The annotated images identify key landmarks along the five-mile section of 'Gold' beach, where British troops landed on June 6, 1944 and where around 1,000 people lost their lives. Top secret: This is part of a fascinating 20ft-long panorama of the French coastline taken during daring spy missions just before D-Day, which will be sold at auction next week . Vital preparations: This photograph from 1944 shows a British amphibious tank going ashore on Gold Beach on D-Day at the portion of the beach near the one above . The archive is made up of 21 plates, each measuring 8ins by 11ins. When pieced together they make a panorama that is almost 20ft long. Officers studied them to familiarise themselves with the landscape and to look for where German gun emplacements were and beach exits for the soldiers. They would also have been used to create highly detailed maps and three dimensional models of the D-Day landing zones. Marked on the pictures, which cover the coastline from Arromanches-les-Bains to La Riviere, are landmarks including a tower, a lighthouse and a coastguard station. Key target: The town of Arromanche-Les-Bains was one of the key targets on June 6 1944 and this annotated images identifies its key features . Incredible: Spitfire pilots and other planes and vessels used sophisticated technology at the time to plot exactly a five mile stretch of beach and surrounding hills occupied by the Germans . Detail: An officer has written on this photo and highlighted the lighthouse at this point on the Normandy coast, stitched together to form part of a giant panorama . Dangerous: This is the beach at Mont Fleury, home to one of the a huge gun battery that could fire on both Gold and Juno beaches, making it one of the key targets at the start of the invasion . Important: St Come de Fresne, pictured here from the sea, was considered an key foothold for the Allies just east of the heart of Gold beach . Plot: The Germans were completely unaware that this plotting of the landscape was taking place and it formed a key element of the June 1944 invasion . Into battle: The images are being sold by the son of Captain Alexander Rodger, commander of infantry landing ship HMS Empire Crossbow (pictured) in the D-Day operation . The photos were taken by brave airmen who flew just 10ft above the sea, 1,000 yards from shore and in broad daylight. They are being sold by the son of Captain Alexander Rodger, commander of infantry landing ship HMS Empire Crossbow in the D-Day operation. The ship carried two companies from the Royal Hampshire Regiment onto Gold beach, where they went on to capture their targets of Arromanches and La Hamel. Daunting: This series of pictures taken on the eve of D-Day shows how high the cliff were along Gold Beach. At points soldiers were forced to climb them, with some reaching 200ft . Detail: Part of the success of D-Day was the amount of planning that had been involved. The Allies carefully plotted landmarks and buildings, like the Coast Guard here, to ensure soldiers were fully prepared when going into battle . Remarkable: Spies had accurately plotted the length of Gold Beach (pictured), by putting together small photographs to make a 21ft panorama that could be viewed like a soldier coming in from the sea . History: The scene and memorial at Arromanches (Gold beach), with the remains of Mulberry Harbour B a temporary harbour used by the British and Canadians to bring in troops and equipment after D-Day . Captain Rodger passed the images on to his son as a keepsake following the war. At . the heart of the plan on D-Day was Gold Beach and the neighbouring . Omaha Beach because it was where the Allies wanted to set up temporary . harbours after the invasion. This meant the Allies could land troops, vehicles and equipment on French soil without having to capture a port first. Mulberry A, as it was called, was installed at Omaha Beach, for . American invasion forces; Mulberry B was set up at Arromanches (Gold . Beach) for the British and Canadians. The pre-fabricated harbours were towed across the English Channel in chunks and put into place on the Normandy beaches. The Mulberry harbours were completed by May 1944 and successfully launched with the use of tug boats soon after. It allowed 220,000 men, 50,000 vehicles . and 600,000 tones of supplies to be landed in France and undoubtedly . helped win the war. The photographs are tipped to fetch £400 when they go under the hammer. Ian . Carter, curator of the photographic archive at the Imperial War Museum, . said the spy photos were commissioned by the Inter-Services Topographic . Department, a joint intelligence organisation, and taken in March 1944. Mr Carter said: 'In the run-up to D-Day the ISTD used reconnaissance photos such as these along with other sources of information to build up a complete picture of the area. 'Highly-skilled pilots would fly very low level missions in Spitfires, Mosquitos or F5 Lightning planes to get the photos needed. 'They were very dangerous sorties. 'The pilots not only faced the possibility of attack from German planes and flak from ground troops but also the inherent dangers of flying 10ft above the waves. 'The planes had cameras mounted in the noses and it was vital the pilots got pictures of every inch of coastline. 'To avoid arousing suspicion among the Germans as to where the landings were going to take place, photos were taken of the coastline from Normandy right up to Belgium and Holland. 'These particular photos show the Gold area from Arromanches-Les-Bains to La Riviere. 'As well as highlighting primary landmarks, the images would have been used to identify the location of German emplacements and possible beach exits. 'They would have been seen by only the highest ranking officials and from them highly detailed maps and 3D models were drawn out and handed to officers. 'These photographs formed a very significant part of this historic mission.' The images are being sold by London-based Charles Miller auctioneers. Mr Miller said: 'The photos themselves are fairly unremarkable but what they represent is astonishing.' The archive will be sold at Charles Miller Ltd in London on October 30.","Allies stitched together the photos to form a 20ft panorama of Normandy coast to prepare for invasion of Gold beach .

A disabled Georgia man went back into a burning home this week to retrieve his beer. Walter Serpit's house was on fire Thursday, but that did not deter him from going back in for his most prized possession, a case of Bud Light. Six adults and two young children made it out, but Mr Serpit - who walks with a cane - narrowly escaped death as he ambled back in for his beloved lager. Party right with Bud Light: Superfan Walter Serpit ran into a burning home to save his prized Bud Light . 'I told them to get the kids out and everything, and me myself, being an alcoholic, I was trying to get my beer out,' Mr Serpit, Of Columbus, told WTVM. I went back into the house like a dummy and the door shut on me because this back draft was about to kill me,' he added. Remarkably, he made his way to the fridge, grabbed the beer and escaped certain fiery doom. News footage showed Mr Serpit's case of beer on the ground while he spoke to the media. No one was injured as a reult of the blaze and it is not clear in what condition the house remains, based on multiple local reports. The Red Cross was on the scene to provide assistance to those affected by the blaze, WTVM noted. A new water heater is suspected in the blaze, but the investigation is still ongoing.","Self-proclaimed alcoholic Walter Serpit walks with a cane .

A shortage of pupils could force the closure of a school that has helped disabled children with learning difficulties for 101 years. The crisis comes despite official figures showing soaring numbers of children are being classed as having special educational needs. St Rose’s was one of only three schools of its type when it was founded by Roman Catholic nuns in 1912 in Stroud, Gloucestershire. St Roses's in Stroud could be forced to close because of plummeting pupil numbers despite soaring numbers of children being classed as having special educational needs . St Rose's, owned by the Dominican Sisters charity, was called 'outstanding' in a recent inspection report . Mother Teresa recognised its remarkable work with a secret visit in 1973. But pupil numbers have plummeted to just 35 at a time when a fifth of all pupils in state schools are considered to have problems including learning difficulties, speech and language needs or a form of autism. Schools can claim extra funds if pupils are classed as having certain types of educational needs, leading some education experts to call the SEN rise an ‘industry’. St Rose’s wholly relies on the county council to cover its £2.16million a year running costs. It is estimated that the school  needs 60 to 70 pupils to survive – and those running it describe the financial situation as ‘scary’. St Rose's was one of three schools of its type when it was founded by Roman Catholic nuns in 1912 . Mother Teresa recognised its remarkable work with a secret visit in 1973 . Sister Teresa Billington, a trustee and governor, said: ‘The nature of disability of the children we have has changed considerably over the 30 years I’ve been here. 'Before children were integrated into mainstream schools, most were in wheelchairs but had fairly mild disabilities and followed the usual curriculum. ‘As integration rose, we had a real change of children with much more profound and complex disability who could never cope in mainstream schools. ‘It would be very hard if the school closed. Parents would be devastated. I would be heartbroken.’ The school, owned by the Dominican Sisters charity, was described as ‘outstanding’ and ‘truly transformational’ in a recent inspection report. Department of Education figures from earlier this year found 1.5million children at all schools were classed as SEN in January. An Ofsted report two years ago said 450,000 children had been given the label to cover up poor teaching.","Pupil numbers at St Rose's in Stroud have dropped to just 35 at a time .

A British schoolboy has been arrested over his alleged involvement in the 'world's biggest cyber attack' generated by a suspected global crime gang. The 16-year-old was taken into custody when police swooped on his south-west London home after investigations identified 'significant sums of money' were 'flowing through his bank account'. Detectives found he was allegedly logged onto several 'virtual systems and forums' when they swooped on the property and worked through the night to collect as much evidence as possible. The teenager was arrested in April when detectives swooped on his south west London home. They allegedly found him' logged onto various virtual systems and forums' The teenager is accused of being involved in one of the world's largest and most destructive cyber attacks, which allowed spam messages for fake drugs and other illegal products to reach people's inboxes. The global crime gang believed to be responsible is accused of unleashing a 'distribution denial of service' (DDoS) attack against the anti-spam group Spamhaus so big that it slowed the internet. The schoolboy was arrested in April and was released on bail, but his alleged link to the crime gang has been kept under wraps until now. His arrest was revealed during a ministerial visit by James Brokenshire MP to the UK government's growing cyber unit last week. A briefing document for the visit, seen by the Evening Standard, under the umbrella of Operation Rashlike, described the cyber attack as the 'largest DDoS attack ever seen' which had a 'worldwide impact' on internet exchanges. In details of the boy's alleged involvement, it states: 'The suspect was found with his computer systems open and logged on to various virtual systems and forums. 'The subject has a significant amount of money flowing through his bank account. Financial investigators are in the process of restraining monies.' Attack: The cyber attack targeted the Dutch anti-spam group Spamhaus, which was listed as being based at Communications House, in London pictured . Officers from the National Cyber Crime Unit, recently formed by the merger of the Police Central e-Crime Unit and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), have been working with detectives worldwide to trace the suspects of the attack. Others have also been identified and their properties raided as part of the operation, according to the Independent, and at least one other arrest has been made - a 35-year-old Dutchman living in Spain. The National Cyber Unit will soon fall under the control of the newly-formed National Crime Agency, employing 4,000 staff tasked with solving and combatting the country's most serious crimes. More than half of the workforce will be trained in fighting cyber crime, a fast-growing potential threat to the UK security. Recently, two cyber attacks on banks were unleashed in Europe. Four men have appeared in court accused of plotting to allegedly take of Santander computers by fitting a device during maintenance work. And in connection with the second attack, eight were arrested over a £1.3million theft by a gang who took control of a Barklays computer, according to the Independent.

It . was written out of the series in 1982, but featured briefly in the 1996 Doctor . Who TV Movie before making a full return in 2005. It is a multifunctional tool used by the Doctor, although its most common function is picking locks. It can also scan people, aliens and other objects. Throughout the series there have been different versions of the sonic screwdriver, depending on which Doctor was using it. In the BBC TV series, Doctor Who uses the gadget to pick locks, perform . medical scans, remotely control other devices and more. The Wand Company wanted to build an exact likeness of the tool but the BBC told it they no longer had any in storage. The company then contacted Tennant who agreed to lend them his sonic screwdriver, kept as a souvenir from his time on the show. It can be programmed to control any infrared appliance and has a built-in motion sensor to detect individual movements. Each battery-operated remote comes with a set of default movements but these can also be personalised. For example, users could flick the screwdriver up to increase volume, or anti-clockwise to turn a device off. The sonic screwdriver was first introduced in 1968.
